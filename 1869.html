  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary said, "The Draconic Formation can be used by a single person or a group. The more people involved, the stronger the resulting defense. Back on the battlefield, Seth and his team faced an onslaught from a million-strong Dark Deity Legion. To hold them off and buy time for tens of thousands of Hudson family members to escape, 500 of them combined their strength to perform the Draconic Formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five hundred people performing the Draconic Formation together created what's known as the 'Veil of Despair.' Even a coordinated attack by a million Dark Deity Legion soldiers couldn't break through it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was utterly stunned to hear that. "The Veil of Despair? A million Dark Deity Legion soldiers? And they still couldn't break through?" he murmured, his eyes lighting up with a mix of awe and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary nodded and replied, "It was because Seth and the 500 others activated the Draconic Formation that the Hudson family's tens of thousands survived. But those 500... their bodies suffered severe consequences. Their vitality has been draining away ever since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, over 100 of them have already died because their vitality was completely depleted. The remaining 300-plus are hanging by a thread. Honestly, they were destined to die&mdash;our family couldn't get our hands on even one white Miracle Elixir. But thanks to you, they now have a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Zachary spoke, his gaze turned fiery, locking onto Osborne. "Let's go. They should be ready by now. It's all on you now, Osborne. Please, you must save them. They're our family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and put away the Draconic Formation, following Zachary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised Osborne was that when he used the Draconic Formation, his body remained unaffected&mdash;there were no signs of vitality leakage. This puzzled him, as he had already prepared to treat himself if necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered, "That's odd. Why didn't I experience any aftereffects from using the Draconic Formation? Could it be... because my Divine Body is stronger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking his head, Osborne decided not to dwell on it. After all, whether the Draconic Formation had side effects or not didn't matter to him. He hadn't learned it for his own use anyway&mdash;it was meant for the Blood Demon members. In this world, he wasn't the only one immune to the formation's aftereffects; the Blood Demon members wouldn't be affected either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "If every Blood Demon member could master the Draconic Formation and use it together... just how terrifying would that be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the Blood Demon members' cultivation levels aren't high when over ten thousand of them cast the Draconic Formation together and merge their powers, their defense would be strong enough to leave a group of the highest Deity King Level completely hopeless, wouldn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if the Blood Demon members all advanced to Deity Kings themselves, performing the Draconic Formation together might even trouble the Supernal Deity Kings. Maybe they wouldn't even be able to crack the defense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fired up by the thought, Osborne immediately used the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's roots to pass on the Draconic Formation to every Blood Demon member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also shared his own insights about the formation with them. He was confident it wouldn't take long before every Blood Demon member could fully master it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before Zachary led Osborne into an enormous building and said, "We're here. Osborne, I'm counting on you." Inside, the place was packed with people, easily numbering over a thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, more than three hundred were lying on hospital beds, their breathing shallow and vitality dim. These three hundred were the ones who had suffered lingering aftereffects from using the Draconic Formation. Without treatment, they wouldn't last much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave it to me." Osborne nodded and opened a dimensional portal, summoning Hannah once more. He said, "Hannah, please help restore their vitality."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he activated the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, beginning the process of healing their weakened bodies. Once their physical injuries were repaired, he had Hannah rejuvenate their vitality, and they quickly recovered, one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing this, the relatives of the afflicted broke down in tears, overwhelmed with gratitude. Zachary and the others couldn't contain their joy either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire process took half a day. By the time all three hundred people had fully recovered, the person who had given the most wasn't Osborne&mdash;it was Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah tirelessly used her life power to restore the vitality of over three hundred people. By the end, her face had grown pale with exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hudson family members noticed how hard she had worked and repeatedly expressed their gratitude. "Thank you. Thank you so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When everything was finally over, Osborne personally escorted Hannah to Hope Haven. "Hannah, thank you for everything this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she heard that, a faint blush replaced the pallor on her face. "Osborne, you don't have to thank me. I'm just happy I could help your family," she replied, looking at Osborne with unmistakable affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, of course, understood what Hannah meant, but he didn't dare entertain such thoughts at the moment. He was afraid of letting her down, so he pretended not to notice. "Go get some rest. I'll go find my grandpa." With that, he hurried off, practically fleeing the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Osborne met with Sebastian and recounted everything that had happened with the Hudson family. Hearing the whole story, Sebastian let out a heavy sigh.</span></p><div class="pagination">
