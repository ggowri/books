  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Equipped with the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, Osborne sliced through the boundless expanse of the cosmos like a comet, his pursuit of the targets unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox and his gang thought they could shake him off by scattering in different directions, but it was a move so naive it was almost comical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second one was down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third one caught!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fourth one neutralized!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the Ascending Sacred Sanctum materialized right in front of Maddox, the other six members of his group were already out cold, tossed carelessly into a corner of the sanctum like discarded toys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair etched itself across Maddox's face like a dark shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hissed through clenched teeth, "Osborne, my men and I have already left Celestara Planet. Why are you coming after us like a rabid dog? I was just Zayne's pawn, lured here against my will. I haven't laid a finger on any member of the Human Community. We're not foes. Let me go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you spare me, I'll be at your beck and call! You know I'm from the Mystic Sirius Sect on Racial Convergence Planet. It's a heavy-hitting sect, well-known and powerful. I'm a disciple</span><span> ranked the seventh</span><span>, and the elders have their eyes on me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They know I'm here. If I don't make it back on time, they'll send someone to look into it for sure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that day comes, you'll be the one facing the music!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Taking me out won't do you any good; it'll just land you in a world of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, just let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's face was a picture of sheer desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't suppress a sneer at his plea. "You want me to let you off the hook? And then what? You think the Mystic Sirius Sect will send someone to investigate? You think I'll be the one in the doghouse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox said, his voice steely, "Precisely! I'm not trying to strong-arm you. I'm just laying it on the line. You don't want to start a hornet's nest, do you? You're gifted and powerful, but on Racial Convergence Planet and within the Mystic Sirius Sect, your might doesn't amount to much!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any core disciple from Racial Convergence Planet could make mincemeat of you, let alone the elders or the sect master!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can't make it back to the Mystic Sirius Sect, they'll dispatch a squad of core disciples to Celestara Planet to get to the bottom of things! Maybe even an elder will make an appearance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're talking about Empyrean Sacredness-level warriors here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox swore he wasn't trying to threaten Osborne, but his words were dripping with veiled threats, using the Mystic Sirius Sect's clout as a weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was practically begging Osborne to see that killing him would only spell disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft chuckle, his eyes twinkling with amusement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've rambled on a lot, but it all comes down to one simple fact&mdash;you're just clinging to the hope of staying alive, aren't you? Well, tough luck! You're not getting out of here. True, offing you might stir up some trouble, but setting you free to return to the Mystic Sirius Sect? That'd land me in an even bigger mess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's face twitched, a flicker of confusion crossing his features. "What do you mean? If you spare me, I give you my word I'll leave you alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a derisive snort. "Oh, come on, Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't try to pull the wool over my eyes. Do you really think I'm that gullible? If I kill you, maybe a handful of core disciples will show up on Celestara Planet to poke around. But if I let you waltz back to the Mystic Sirius Sect, I can bet my bottom dollar that it won't be long before I've got a bunch of Empyrean Sacredness warriors breathing down my neck, gunning for my head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's eyes bulged in shock. "What are you talking about? I don't get it! I've already given you my promise. I swear, if you let me go, I won't come after you again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's contempt was thick in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still acting dumb? Once you're back at the Mystic Sirius Sect, you won't even have to lift a finger against me! All you need to do is mention my Sacred Artifact palace to the big-wigs, and they'll come storming onto Celestara Planet, eager to take me out and snatch my palace away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To safeguard the secret of the Sacred Artifact Palace, how could I set you free?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, let's cut the small talk, shall we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's face drained of color in terror, and then quickly contorted into a snarl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that pleading was a waste of breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had made his stance crystal clear&mdash;unless he was utterly clueless about the value of the Sacred Artifact palace, there was no chance he'd let him go scot-free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, if you're going to kill me, I'll put up a fight!" Maddox bellowed, deciding to face him head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly for him, even as an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King, he was no match for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick, fluid movement, Osborne whipped out the Bloodwrought Bow and casually loosed two arrows. The arrows struck Maddox hard, leaving him severely injured and completely helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of finishing him off, Osborne decided to take Maddox back to the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, directing it towards Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation etched on his face, Maddox pleaded, "Osborne, I'm willing to serve you! I'll be your loyal servant, doing whatever you need, as long as you spare my life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can control me however you want, and I promise I won't betray you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, his eyes glinting with amusement. "Well, well! You've come to your senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's exactly what I was hoping for when I chose not to kill you. Your willingness to cooperate saves me a lot of hassle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll make sure you're under my control, so there's no chance of betrayal. You'd better not resist, though; my patience is limited!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's hope dwindled as despair took its place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But compared to death, he preferred being under Osborne's control and reluctantly nodded. "I promise I won't resist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting more time, Osborne summoned a blood-red root from his body, plunging it deep into Maddox. Since Maddox didn't resist, the root quickly took hold within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Maddox was fully under Osborne's control, transformed into his Blood Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My lord!" he said, bowing with newfound respect, his demeanor completely altered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An Ascension Nine Blood Golem was incredibly valuable to him, particularly given that the cultivation levels of his Blood Demon members had dropped considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ordered, "Just hold your horses for a bit. I've got to subdue the others and turn them into my Blood Golems as well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox, being an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King, was a tough nut to crack for Osborne. If he put up a fight, it would be no easy feat to transform him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the remaining six were merely at the Ascension Seven level, far weaker than Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't even waste time asking for their permission. He just drove the roots into their bodies, setting the transformation process in motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took a while, but in the end, all six of them were successfully transformed into Blood Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the seven of them stood dutifully behind Osborne, ready to make their way back to Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the journey back, Osborne realized that during their hasty chase, he had used up a large number of Sacred Crystals to boost the speed of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. Since there was no longer any need to rush, he significantly reduced the speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of curiosity, he turned to Maddox and asked, "I'm truly intrigued. Why were you all trying to flee deeper into the cosmos? Were you planning to traverse the entire cosmos to get back to Racial Convergence Planet? That place is quite a distance from Celestara Planet, isn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not take the deep-space route? It seems like it would be a shorter way to reach Elf City and then continue on to Racial Convergence Planet, doesn't it?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
