  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everett's words struck like a thunderclap, instantly putting Wesson on high alert.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everett chuckled, giving Wesson a reassuring pat on the shoulder. "Relax. And don't get curious about how we know this. Sebastian's been hurt pretty badly and has gone into hiding to recover. The fight with Gerardo? Quite a few folks are aware of it."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's brow furrowed deeply, his expression a mix of concern and suspicion.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a long pause, he finally spoke, "Since you know Godfather isn't here, what brings you to our territory?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everett flashed a grin. "Well, you Augustine family are hosting the Honor Quest Ceremony, and we couldn't resist coming to see the show. Plus, we're here on business, representing the League of Divine Descent."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Everett stepped back slightly, making room for Rumen to step forward.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the vice leader of the League, Rumen held a higher position.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen said, "Since Sebastian's not around, we're perfectly fine talking to you instead. After all, you're Sebastian's most trusted steward, and during his absence, you're in charge of the Draco Group's affairs."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's frown deepened. "What kind of business are we discussing?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen smiled, a calculating glimmer in his eye, "Rare metals.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rosmandi is the richest source of rare metals on Blue Planet. Seventy percent of the world's rare metals come from there! Your Draco Group controls over eighty percent of those resources but rarely engages in international trade.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We believe it's time to shake things up. We need these metals in large quantities to advance our technology. So, we'd like to propose a deal: let us accelerate the development of your rare metal mines, and we can split the profits. Seventy-thirty."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's face turned grim. "All the rare metal mines are owned by the Draco Group. Why should we give you thirty percent of our profits?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen simply smiled, maintaining a calm demeanor, "You've misunderstood.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When I say seventy-thirty, I mean we take the seventy, and you only get thirty! That's already a generous offer from the League of Divine Descent. The majority of our members thought we should take ninety percent, leaving you with just ten."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson was left speechless, disbelief etched across his features.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're dreaming! You think we'd ever consider letting you near our rare metal mines? Even if we were open to the idea, we'd only ever give you ten percent!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen's expression turned icy. "You seem to have gotten a few things twisted.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're not here to negotiate; we're here to inform you. Whether you agree to our terms or not, the League of Divine Descent has made up its mind about your rare metal mines.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And just so you know, if you act cooperatively, there's still a chance for you to walk away with thirty percent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But if you resist, we won't hesitate to take matters into our own hands. With Sebastian injured, I assume you don't expect to fend off the League on your own, do you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The smug look on Rumen's face was matched by the other two figures behind him, Marlon and Ebony, who regarded Wesson with a mix of pride and contempt.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fury surged through Wesson, clenching his fists tightly. "You think you can just waltz in here, disregarding global agreements, and seize control of Rosmandi? Don't you fear sparking a world war in the realm of power?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen replied with a casual chuckle, "Global agreements?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We certainly wouldn't take these lightly, but those agreements can't touch the Aberrants.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After all, the Aberrants are also a power in Rosmandi. If they decide to act against you, it would be considered an internal conflict for your country, and those global agreements wouldn't apply to them."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen's words sent a jolt of fear through Wesson, and he could feel his composure slipping.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen continued with a cold grin, "To be honest, Gerardo has already agreed that if we help him wipe out the Augustine family, he'll hand over half of the rare metal mines in Rosmandi to the League of Divine Descent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But half isn't enough for us. That's why we're here. If you agree to give us seventy percent of the rare metal mines, we'll protect you from the Aberrants." A menacing glint flickered in his eyes as he leaned closer. "If you refuse... well, we might just have to send our people to infiltrate the Aberrants and take you and the Draco Group out ourselves."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, a chilling threat hung in the air.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's body trembled with anger, his fists clenched tight. "You're nothing but vultures taking advantage of a disaster!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen and Everett burst into raucous laughter, their amusement echoing in the tense atmosphere.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen chuckled, the glee in his voice almost mocking. "Exactly! We're taking advantage!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're stronger; we have the upper hand. If you don't want to get robbed blind, you'd better think twice about crossing us!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Make a choice right now!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Will you ally with the League of Divine Descent, or will you stand against us?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's rage boiled beneath the surface, but alongside it came a wave of helplessness.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Sebastian absent, he was left in a precarious position.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What am I supposed to do?!" Wesson thought, grappling with the pressure of the looming threat.</p><div class="pagination">
