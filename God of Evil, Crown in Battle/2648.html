        <div> - Silencing<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>The nine-colored lightnings in the sky grew more and more numerous. They soon covered the entire sky and stretched continuously for several miles.<br>With the nine-colored lightnings in the sky, the might of the Infant Soul Grand Formation was completely suppressed.<br>All of it was because of Chu Feng.<br>However, if that was all there were to it, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster would not panic like he did.<br>The reason why he was panicking so much was because after Chu Feng used his Divine level Lightning Mark, his cultivation had increased from rank one True Immortal to rank two True Immortal.<br>Chu Feng had managed to increase his cultivation by an entire level. The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was unable to accept this fact.<br>There were many Heavenly Clans in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, and countless Heavenly Bloodline possessors. The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster had witnessed these so-called Lightning Marks many times before.<br>However, those Lightning Marks were only able to increase one&rsquo;s battle power.<br>While Lightning Mark was an ability that Heavenly Bloodline possessors would only obtain after their Nine Lightnings Fusion, and was the final ability that Heavenly Bloodline possessors would awaken, Lightning Mark was relatively weak compared to<br>Lightning<br>Armor and<br>Lightning<br>Wings, abilities that could increase one&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s Lightning Mark was not at all weaker than his<br>Lightning<br>Armor and<br>Lightning<br>Wings. After all&hellip; his Lightning Mark had increased his cultivation by an entire level.<br>&ldquo;That seems to be the character Divine?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that only Divine Punishment Mysterious Techniques can allow one to condense a Divine level Lightning Mark.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for this Chu Feng, he actually managed to even increase his cultivation by an entire level. He has most definitely trained in that legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Exactly what is his origin? He actually managed to train in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, something that no one in our Chu Heavenly Clan possesses right now.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Yue further observed Chu Feng, she grew even more astonished.<br>Actually, Chu Yue and Chu Huai had both heard rumors that Chu Feng&rsquo;s Lightning Mark displayed the character Divine.<br>However, as they knew very well that only those who had trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique were able to condense a Divine level Lightning Mark, they did not trust the rumors.<br>The reason for that was because they did not feel that Chu Feng would be capable of training in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was a legend even for the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Not only was the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique extremely rare, even if one could learn it, very few people dared to train in it. The reason for that was because each and every tribulation from the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique could take one&rsquo;s life. One must either succeed or die trying, with no other option.<br>The people from the Chu Heavenly Clan knew that very well. The reason for that was because there had been people from the Chu Heavenly Clan that trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. Even now, there were many people from the Chu Heavenly Clan that had witnessed the might of the Divine Tribulation&rsquo;s lightning.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what is the origin of this Chu Feng?&rdquo; A trace of admiration appeared in the gaze with which Chu Huai looked to Chu Feng.<br>Asking himself truthfully, he knew that he would not be able to handle the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. However, Chu Feng had successfully managed to handle it. As such, he naturally felt admiration for Chu Feng.<br>After all, both of them were Heavenly Bloodline possessors.<br>Suddenly, Chu Yue asked, &ldquo;Chu Huai, say, could this Chu Feng possibly be Senior Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s child?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible. Senior Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s child has already died,&rdquo; Chu Huai said.<br>&ldquo;But his name&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Yue said.<br>&ldquo;With how vast the world is, there are countless people with the same name and surname. You can&rsquo;t assume that just because it&rsquo;s a Heavenly Bloodline possessor with the name Chu Feng that he would definitely be Senior Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s child,&rdquo; Chu Huai said.<br>&ldquo;The key aspect is his Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique,&rdquo; Chu Yue said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Huai started to hesitate. However, he soon shook his head again, &ldquo;No, Senior Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s child has already died. Furthermore, this Chu Feng must be using a pseudonym. His actual name couldn&rsquo;t possibly be Chu Feng. Rather, he simply cannot be surnamed Chu.&rdquo;<br>Chu Huai spoke with great certainty.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword suddenly started moving. In merely the blink of an eye, it arrived before the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>That brightly shining Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword was less than a meter away from the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>At such a short distance, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster had simply lost all opportunity to escape. Only death by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword awaited him.<br>However, Chu Feng did not kill him immediately. Rather, he stood there and looked at the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>At the beginning, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster had a panicky expression. He was filled with a fear of death. Soon, that fear grew stronger and stronger. Perhaps it was because he didn&rsquo;t want to die, but his body started to shiver and tremble violently. His trembling was so strong that anyone could see it.<br>However, after a short period of time passed, the fear on the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster&rsquo;s face actually eased somewhat. Then, he started to laugh bitterly.<br>&ldquo;My master once said to me that the most unreasonable people in this world are the geniuses.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, I finally believe his esteemed self&rsquo;s words.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Geniuses are truly the most unreasonable people in this world,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said with a wry smile.<br>Earlier, he felt extremely unreconciled to be suppressed by Chu Feng. However, he now no longer possessed the feeling of irreconciliation.<br>As matters stood, he had no choice but to accept that he was inferior to Chu Feng.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng possessed heaven-defying powers.<br>It was something that ordinary people did not possess.<br>&ldquo;Tell me, exactly what sort of seal are you trying to undo with this grand formation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;What? Seal?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the people from the allied army and even Chu Yue and Chu Huai were all surprised.<br>They all knew that the grand formation that Chu Feng was talking about was that Infant Soul Grand Formation. However, none of them were able to tell that it was an unsealing formation.<br>&ldquo;Amazing, you actually managed to see through it,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster laughed bitterly. Then, he said, &ldquo;However, I am someone who is definitely going to die. Why should I tell you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I were you, I would state the reason,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Is that so? Give me a reason why,&rdquo; The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;I know that all of this is not something that you planned to do. Your Infant Soul Sect&hellip; does not have the ability to set up such a grand formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Someone taught you this formation. Furthermore, you are being helped from the shadows.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done everything for the sake of another. You are but a tool, a puppet manipulated by another.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Being exploited for so long, what sort of benefits have you obtained? Is the benefit just continued exploitation? Is the benefit those forbidden medicines that you&rsquo;ve taken that will cause you to lose your life?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The person exploiting you simply does not care about your life, the lives of everyone from your Infant Soul Sect or the lives of everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. All that person cares about is accomplishing their goal,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>As he spoke, his voice grew louder and louder, more and more intimidating.<br>Hearing those words, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster grew silent.<br>At that moment, Chu Huai, Chu Yue, Ying Mingchao, Wang Qiang and the others all revealed marvelous expressions. They truly had no idea that everything the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster did was under someone else&rsquo;s dictation.<br>Most importantly, judging from the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster&rsquo;s current appearance, it seemed that he had admitted to it.<br>&ldquo;If I were you, I would say everything even if I was to die.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It wouldn't be considered betrayal. After all, it is simply unworthy to shield someone like that,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Hearing those words, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster closed his eyes. When he opened his eyes again, there was a trace of relief in his gaze.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, this is an unsealing formation. It is a grand formation that can only be operated using living souls.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Due to the fact that I possessed limited capabilities, I was unable to set up a grand formation that could forcibly deprive another of their soul.&rdquo;<br>As such, I needed the cooperation of others. I needed those whose souls are going to be extracted to willingly fuse with the grand formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is why&hellip; I created the lie stating that this grand formation was capable of helping others increase their cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was all so that I could obtain their cooperation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the Chen Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s cultivation breakthrough, he had actually already broken through to rank one True Immortal. We merely hid his cultivation using special medicines. That is why others were unable to detect his actual cultivation, and thought that this grand formation actually helped him increase his cultivation,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, what is it that this grand formation is trying to unseal?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a serious expression.<br>A grand formation that was operated using countless souls, the thing that it would unseal was most definitely not something good.<br>&ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Then who is the person instructing you from the shadows?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;He is Chu&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~~&rdquo;<br>Before he could finish his words, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster exploded.<br>At that moment, everyone&rsquo;s expression changed enormously. The reason for that was because Chu Feng did not act to kill the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>Thus, it meant that someone else had killed the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>Someone had silenced him!!!<br><br></p></div>
