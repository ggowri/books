        <div> - Authentication<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng took another step onto the seventh step.<br>When Chu Feng arrived on the seventh step of the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps, the astonished sounds of the crowd could be heard nonstop. It was not only the people of the younger generation that were astonished; even those from the older generation were voicing out their astonishment.<br>One must know that this was the Chu Heavenly Clan, and the people there were all people of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>They were the most knowledgeable and most noble group of people in the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>However, upon seeing Chu Feng ascending to the seventh step, they were truly incapable of remaining calm.<br>The reason for that was because the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; seventh step was the place that their current Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had ascended to.<br>In other words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent was, at the very least, comparable to their Clan Chief&rsquo;s.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ve truly underestimated you.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s expression had also changed. The seventh step was something that not even she had managed to reach.<br>Should one be able to ascend to the seventh step, one would be a dragon among men, a dragon among all Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>However, this was not Chu Feng&rsquo;s target. Chu Feng lifted his foot once again. He was planning to ascend to the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; eighth step.<br>When Chu Feng made this motion, no one was capable of taking their eyes off him. In fact, they even held their breath.<br>The eighth step was something that only their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Old Ancestor managed to reach. Would Chu Feng&hellip; really be capable of reaching it?<br>&ldquo;Step~~~&rdquo;<br>Success. Chu Feng successfully placed one foot on the eighth step. He had beaten the current Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s record, and the records of the great majority of people in the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s history.<br>After all, only three individuals had managed to ascend to the eighth step in the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s entire history.<br>They were Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandfather, Chu Hanxian.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s father, Chu Xuanyuan.<br>And the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Old Ancestor, Chu Yetianhong.<br>Success. Chu Feng really managed to succeed in that impossible feat.<br>At that moment, the eyes of the crowd present were all heated up. In fact, deep within the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s main city, an old man&rsquo;s expression had turned complicated.<br>That old man was none other than the current second strongest expert in the Chu Heavenly Clan, Chu Hanpeng.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you are indeed Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Hanpeng turned around and planned to leave.<br>&ldquo;Mn?&rdquo; However, once he turned around, he immediately noticed something, and turned his eyes back toward Chu Feng. In the next moment, great disbelief appeared in his deep and profound eyes.<br>Meanwhile, outside of the main city hall, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen gathered there also burst into a complete uproar.<br>After Chu Feng ascended to the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; eighth step, he raised his leg again and successfully placed his foot on the ninth step.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, he&rsquo;s planning to challenge the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; ninth step!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Will he be able to accomplish it? Will Chu Feng really be able to reach the ninth step?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all astonished. As for those people of the younger generation that were not fond of Chu Feng, they were completely dumbstruck.<br>Having reached the eighth step, Chu Feng had already proved that he possessed talent comparable to their Old Ancestor, something that no one in the Chu Heavenly Clan currently possessed.<br>However, Chu Feng actually wanted to continue, to challenge the ninth step. If he were to succeed, it would truly be astonishing.<br>Not to mention returning to their Chu Heavenly Clan, their Chu Heavenly Clan would definitely put great emphasis into nurturing Chu Feng. Likely, he would receive greater emphasis than even geniuses like Chu Ruoshi, Chu Lingxi, Chu Huanyu and Chu Haoyan.<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s other foot left the eighth step. In the end, his other foot landed firmly to the ninth step.<br>Chu Feng was firmly standing on the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; ninth step.<br>At that moment, the crowd went absolutely quiet. Not to mention the people of the younger generation, even the elders present were dumbfounded. All those years, ever since Chu Xuanyuan, no one else had managed to ascend to the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; ninth step.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that, with a lion for a father, the son is truly not a dog.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, there were people of the older generation that were unable to keep themselves from praising Chu Feng in their hearts.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong with the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps, there&rsquo;s most definitely something wrong with the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps! How could he possibly ascend to the ninth step of the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps?!&rdquo;<br>A shout was suddenly heard at that moment.<br>It was Chu Huanyu.<br>Chu Huanyu&rsquo;s sudden shout at that moment of absolute silence resembled a sudden clap of thunder emerging in a clear sky. He immediately caught the attention of the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Chu Huanyu, what is the meaning of your words?! Are you implying that our Law Enforcement Hall is engaging in fraud?!&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa asked in a very displeased manner.<br>&ldquo;I am not aiming my words against anyone specific. However, there is most definitely something wrong with the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will not bother to dispute with you all either. I, Chu Huanyu, will use my own body to prove to you all that there&rsquo;s something wrong with the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Huanyu finished saying those words, he immediately moved to act. He was actually walking toward the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps.<br>&ldquo;Step, step, step~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Huanyu&rsquo;s speed was very fast. In the blink of an eye, he arrived on the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; fourth step. However, at that moment, he started to slow down.<br>Four lightning bolts were revolving around him, and an expression of pain filled his face.<br>&ldquo;Chu Huanyu is actually already somewhat incapable of continuing after reaching the fourth step?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all astonished. Chu Huanyu was a genius of the Chu Heavenly Clan, a genius that had once ascended to the sixth step. His face was actually covered in pain after reaching the fourth step.<br>Wouldn&rsquo;t this instead prove that that Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps had no issues at all then?!<br><br><br></p></div>
