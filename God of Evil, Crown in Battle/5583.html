        <h1>Chapter 5583: The Godlike Chaotic Era Scholar</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing the changes in his </span><span>dantian</span><span> world, Chu Feng quickly projected his consciousness in, only to see that the lightning prison had become extremely small, with a radius of no more than ten meters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the center of the lightning prison was a frail bundle of flame that looked like it would be snuffed out at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nine lightning beasts continued to roam the </span><span>dantian</span><span> world as if nothing had happened at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Thank you, elders.&rdquo; Chu Feng respectfully bowed to the nine lightning beasts, knowing that they had saved him. The lightning beasts paid him no heed, but he was accustomed to their nonchalant attitude. He turned to the red lightning beast and asked, &ldquo;Elder, what&rsquo;s the situation? Do you know the background of that red-haired woman?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng knew that the red-haired lightning beast was the only one who was willing to communicate with him, but to his disappointment, the latter didn&rsquo;t answer his question. Seeing that, he decided not to probe any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that the nine lightning beasts possessed sentience. It was not that they couldn&rsquo;t hear him but that they couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to waste their breath on him, so it was pointless to probe any further when they were unwilling to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chu Feng still wanted to know what was going on. At the very least, he hoped to gather some information about the palace. So, he turned to the dying speck of flame inside the lightning prison and asked, &ldquo;Are you still alive? Speak if you aren&rsquo;t dead yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the speck of flame didn&rsquo;t answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng took a closer look at the speck of flame&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t sense the red-haired woman&rsquo;s aura. In the end, he could only give up and project his consciousness back to his main body, where he immediately saw Little Fishy standing before him with a worried expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you certain? That red-haired woman felt dangerous.&rdquo; Little Fishy thought that Chu Feng was trying to console her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;She was planning to steal my body. That earlier test was nothing more than a ploy for her to find out which of our bodies is more suitable for her. There was no fortuitous encounter at all,&rdquo; Chu Feng said those words via voice transmission because he </span><span>didn</span><span>&rsquo;t want Jie Tian to know the truth. &ldquo;However, I&rsquo;m fine. My bloodline has suppressed her. She can&rsquo;t hurt me anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> worry finally dissipated into a sweet smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big brother, you&rsquo;re formidable. Then, do you know what she is? I don&rsquo;t think she belongs here, right?&rdquo; Little Fishy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only a brief encounter, but she had already come up with her deductions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that red-haired woman belongs here either, but I&rsquo;m unable to </span><span>communicate with her because she&rsquo;s already on the verge of death. However, I did see a humongous monster sealed in the far distance. It shares the same aura as the red-haired woman; I suspect that it&rsquo;s her main body, just that it has been sealed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;If I have to fathom a guess, that red-haired woman likely came here for this place&rsquo;s treasure, only to end up getting sealed away. What we encountered earlier might be a sliver of her soul, which escaped using some kind of special means. It probably wasn&rsquo;t easy for her to do so, so she wanted to steal my body,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;In other words, that woman&rsquo;s appearance is an accident, and we haven&rsquo;t really cleared this place&rsquo;s trial yet?&rdquo; Little Fishy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weng!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive starlight spirit formation gate suddenly appeared in the sky, and a powerful suction force dragged Chu Feng and the others in. They began to swiftly plummet downward, eventually landing in the Star Memorial Domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaotic Era Scholar and the black aura monster were standing not too far away. The palace they had previously entered was also right in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why did we return here? Is the trial finished?&rdquo; Little Fishy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was another gigantic starlight spirit formation gate reminiscent of the one they had just passed through above their heads right now. This energy had come from the Star Sea Realm, suggesting that the Star Sea Realm was the culprit that had ejected them from the trial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why would this happen? Could it be that the trial had ended? Considering how they hadn&rsquo;t failed any of the tests yet, there was no reason for them to be expelled from the trial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The starlight spirit formation gate dissipated. It looked like everything had ended just like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like you have failed,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder Chaotic Era Scholar, we didn&rsquo;t fail! That fellow obtained the palace&rsquo;s treasure!&rdquo; Jie Tian pointed his finger at Chu Feng as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar looked at Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, what I encountered is not a treasure but a threat!&rdquo; Chu Feng quickly informed Chaotic Era Scholar about everything that had happened, including the powerful sealing formation he had seen and the red-haired woman&rsquo;s association with the humongous sealed monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that the red-haired woman was a formidable individual, and it was likely that she could bring him significant benefits in the future even though she was in a terribly weakened state. Under normal circumstances, he would have withheld this information from Chaotic Era Scholar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chaotic Era Scholar&rsquo;s capabilities were at a whole new level; Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that he would be able to deceive him. Thus, he honestly confessed to everything. After all, his greatest priority right now was self-preservation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let me take a look.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaotic Era Scholar placed his palm on Chu Feng&rsquo;s head, and the latter felt as if someone was looking right inside of him as if he was lying bare. Even his </span><span>dantian</span><span> was </span><span>fully exposed as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was taken aback. He had known that Chaotic Era Scholar was a formidable expert, but he didn&rsquo;t think that the latter would be this powerful. He couldn&rsquo;t help but think that the latter was more like a god rather than a mortal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was relieved that he didn&rsquo;t try to deceive Chaotic Era Scholar, or else the consequences would have been dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Chaotic Era Scholar retracted his palm and fell into deep thought. He pondered for a moment before eventually making up his mind. He first clenched his right fist tightly before slowly opening them up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bundle of spirit power appeared in his palm. It was small, but the world shook in its presence. Even cultivators of Chu Feng and Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> caliber struggled to keep their balance. It felt like the bundle of spirit power harnessed sufficient power to destroy worlds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What are you planning to do?&rdquo; Little Fishy anxiously asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to charge to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side, but she found that she couldn&rsquo;t move at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaotic Era Scholar continued staring at Chu Feng before suddenly bursting into laughter. Then, he thrust his palm toward the palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless chains flew forth from his palm to surround the gigantic palace. Tremendous starlight energy gushed out from the palace in retaliation, but Chaotic Era Scholar&rsquo;s chains were far too powerful for the starlight energy to oppose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, the starlight energy succumbed, and the palace was completely shackled by the chains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world shook even more intensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng and Little Fishy lost their balance and fell onto their bums, but their eyes remained fixated on the chain formation and the palace. The palace was on its last leg after having lost the protection of the starlight energy, and it quickly contracted till it was barely the size of a pea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaotic Era Scholar waved his arm, and the pea-sized palace flew into his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cracks began appearing all over the Star Memorial Domain, including its sky. It looked like the world was going to be destroyed now that it had lost its core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chaotic Era Scholar paid no heed to the changes. He hurled his fist forth and shattered the space in front of him, but this was no simple punch&mdash;he had created a spirit formation passageway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his arm, Chaotic Era Scholar removed the restriction formations he had placed on Chu Feng and the others before sweeping Chu Feng and Little Fishy into the spirit formation passageway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Two young friends, you have accomplished your mission. May we meet again,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said with a smile as he gently pushed Chu Feng and Little Fishy into the spirit formation passageway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the two of them came out of the spirit formation passageway, they had returned to the real world. The spirit formation passageway that had transported them </span><span>out of the Star Sea Realm closed and vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Did he spare us?&rdquo; Little Fishy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That seems to be the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big brother, what did he do to you earlier?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He inspected my body to verify the authenticity of my words.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Did he discover the red-haired woman?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He did.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Did he take the red-haired woman away with him?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s weird. He didn&rsquo;t even take the red-haired woman with him, but he sent us out without asking any further questions. Furthermore, what does he mean when he says that we have accomplished our mission?&rdquo; Little Fishy was curious about the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head. Moments later, he suddenly widened his eyes. &ldquo;No, Chaotic Era Scholar did something to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng noticed that Chaotic Era Scholar had left a message in his mind.</span></p></div>
