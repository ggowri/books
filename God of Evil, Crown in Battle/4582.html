        <h1>Chapter 4581</h1>
        <div>: Screams in the Forbidden Ground<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart had never been at ease in the days he had spent at the Holy Light Clan. He couldn&rsquo;t ascertain the attitude the Holy Light Clan carried toward him.<br>He chose to remain because he wanted the Holy Light Bloodline Essence. He was aware of the dangers, but in hopes of quickly raising his cultivation, he decided to take a gamble and bet on it.<br>Ever since his time in the Lower Realm, he had always thrived and grown in danger. He believed that opportunities and risks came hand-in-hand.<br>Unfortunately, he had gambled wrongly this time around.<br>From the moment Shengguang Yunyue handed him over the Holy Light Bloodline Essence, he was already aware of the attitude the Holy Light Clan carried toward him.<br>Before Long Xiaoxiao left, she had bid Chu Feng farewell. She told him that he had obtained the Holy Light Bloodline Essence as a reward and showed it to him.<br>Chu Feng was, after all, a world spiritist who possessed the Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes. Having Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s Holy Light Bloodline Essence as a medium of comparison, he could tell right away that the one that was given to him was a fake.<br>So, when Shengguang Yunyue told him to swallow it down right away, he guessed that it was likely to contain poison. From this, it would appear that the Holy Light Clan had already decreed his death.<br>It was just that the Holy Light Clan was far more vicious than Chu Feng thought them out to be. He didn&rsquo;t think that they were thinking of using him as a cauldron to treat Shengguang Yu&rsquo;s injuries. They were intending on turning him into medicine!!<br>However, it was also a blessing in disguise that the Holy Light Clan had such vile intents because this was what that would save Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.<br>The process of being used to concoct medicine would be painful, but they wouldn&rsquo;t kill Chu Feng right away. This provided him with a chance to make a getaway.<br>So, Chu Feng swallowed the Holy Light Bloodline Essence, and in order to fool Shengguang Yunyue, he even really assimilated a small portion of it. Through that, he was able to understand what kind of changes would occur to his body if he were to assimilate all of the poison and emulate the effects through a formation.<br>In other words, it was true that he had been poisoned, but it was very light, almost to an indiscernible degree. The pained look and ugly exterior were nothing more than a trick of Chu Feng&rsquo;s formations.<br>This was also the reason why Chu Feng looked so spirited now and could easily hold Shengguang Yu down.<br>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t consume the poison. You were acting earlier?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Yu was also a smart man. After a short moment of confusion, he swiftly figured out the reason.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. It was all an act. What do you think about it? Convincing?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a teasing smile.<br>He knew that Shengguang Yu must be suffering a mental breakdown at this very moment. Everything was still going well for him a moment ago, but in the blink of an eye, he was held down by the man whom he thought of nothing more than a cauldron. It went without saying that he must have been feeling very disappointed at the moment.<br>&ldquo;You bastard!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Yu bellowed out with gritted teeth as he tried to retaliate.<br>Wu!<br>But before he could stand up and deal with Chu Feng, a pained expression appeared on his face. Chu Feng had tightened the grip around his neck.<br>&ldquo;Young master Shengguang Yu, I advise you to watch your words. Your life is in my hands right now,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Kill me if you dare then! I can frankly tell you that the area is guarded by Lord Yunyue and the other elders of the Holy Light Clan. Not only so, but this formation we are in is driven by my grandfather too! If anything happens to me, you won&rsquo;t be able to get away alive!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Yu had quite some spunk. Despite being held hostage by Chu Feng, he showed no signs of surrendering.<br>Of course, it was due to the strong backing behind him that he dared to do so too.<br>&ldquo;You need not use Shengguang Yunyue and your grandfather to threaten me. Just like you, they wish to take my life too. Do you think that I&rsquo;ll spare them?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.<br>&ldquo;How laughable. The likes of you dare to talk about taking my grandfather&rsquo;s life? I sure would like to see you devoting your life to achieving something futile! Hahaha!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Yu&rsquo;s laughter was filled with disdain and sarcasm for what Chu Feng had just said.<br>He had to admit that Chu Feng was indeed incredibly talented, but he felt that Chu Feng was daydreaming if he really thought that he could take his grandfather&rsquo;s life.<br>&ldquo;It looks like young master Yu is very fond of laughing? Not bad. I pray that you&rsquo;ll be able to continue laughing no matter what happens to you.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng whipped out a dagger with his other hand.<br>&ldquo;Y-you&hellip; What are you planning to do?!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Yu panicked upon seeing the dagger in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands.<br>He noticed that the dagger Chu Feng was holding was a little special. It looks more like a tool intended for bloodletting.<br>Pu!<br>Chu Feng answered Shengguang Yu&rsquo;s question with his actions. He stabbed the dagger right into Shengguang Yu&rsquo;s body.<br>Gahhh!<br>A guttural cry escaped from Shengguang Yu.<br>&ldquo;What are you doing? You should continue laughing! I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do if you give in so quickly&hellip; The show has only just begun.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he drew out his knife and plunged it into Shengguang Yu&rsquo;s body once more.<br>This time, his hands didn&rsquo;t stop. He continued stabbing and pulling out his knife again and again without rest.<br>In a short few moments, the dagger had already left dozens of bloodied holes all over Shengguang Yu&rsquo;s body. Blood was spilling out from every single one of these wounds, causing Shengguang Yu to swiftly weaken.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, d-don&rsquo;t kill me&hellip; Don&rsquo;t kill me&hellip; As long as I&rsquo;m alive, there&rsquo;s still ground for negotiation&hellip; I&rsquo;ll talk to my grandfather and ask him to spare you&hellip; But if I were to die, you won&rsquo;t get away alive either&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Yu began speaking once more, but the arrogance had already been plunged out of his body. He was in a very pitiful and humble state. Tears were streaming out of his eyes as his face was scrunched in great pain.<br>&ldquo;Young master Yu, it isn&rsquo;t appropriate for you to do this. Didn&rsquo;t I mention that I am fond of your laughter? Why are you begging me instead of laughing?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng said with an almost demonic smile as he drew out the dagger once more, only to plunge it into Shengguang Yu&rsquo;s body yet again.<br>Gahh!<br>A heart-rending cry echoed within the dark temple.<br>It was just a pity that no one outside could hear it, for Chu Feng had already used his formation to isolate the two of them from the rest of the world.<br>No matter how Shengguang Yu screamed and thrashed about, there was no one who would notice the state he was in and come to his rescue.<br>How ironic it was that a young master of the Holy Light Clan would actually be tortured in the very heart of the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s forbidden ground&hellip;<br></p></div>
