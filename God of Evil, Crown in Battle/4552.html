        <div>: Differentiation of Ranking<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unable to withhold his curiosity, Chu Feng turned to look at Yin Buyu too.<br>Yin Buyu had a good-looking face and an exceptional disposition. Wearing a neat green robe and holding a foldable paper fan in hand, he looked like an accomplished individual. Like many other prodigies, however, he looked upon others with unconcealed condescension, but he did have the right to look down on others.<br>It was apparent that Yin Buyu enjoyed having the limelight on him as he actually clasped his fist and began greeting those that were looking his way.<br>Weng!<br>Barely after Yin Buyu&rsquo;s name appeared, purple light began moving around the second mountain, and yet another name appeared.<br>Windmounting Sect, Jiang Changkong!<br>As soon as this name appeared, the eyes of the crowd, which were still fixed on Yin Buyu a moment ago, turned toward another direction, where several massive warships were floating in mid-air.<br>Hung up high on the warships were flags with the words &lsquo;Windmounting Sect&rsquo; written on them.<br>Chu Feng noticed that when the words &lsquo;Windmounting Sect, Jiang Changkong&rsquo; appeared on the second mountain, Yin Buyu&rsquo;s face suddenly turned incredibly awful.<br>From the discussions around him, Chu Feng quickly understood the reason behind Yin Buyu&rsquo;s reaction.<br>Windmounting Sect was a power from Death Starfield too, and Jiang Changkong was the closed-door disciple of the Windmounting Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster. Even though he wasn&rsquo;t the son of the Windmounting Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, his talents still made him deeply favored by the latter.<br>Similar to Yin Buyu, Jiang Changkong had also made his name a long time ago,<br>While they weren&rsquo;t as powerful as Yu Lie, they were still deemed as prodigies by the world. At the very least, their reputation far exceeded that of Long Xiaoxiao and the others.<br>Given that Jiang Changkong and Yin Buyu were both from the Death Starfield, it was inevitable that the two of them would be compared with one another, so they didn&rsquo;t have a good opinion of one another.<br>And one year ago, they finally clashed with one another.<br>The duel ended up in Jiang Changkong&rsquo;s victor, leaving Yin Buyu to bear the reputation of being &lsquo;second to Jiang Changkong&rsquo;.<br>From the moment that their names appeared right after one another, everyone immediately came to a realization&mdash;this was the ranking of the juniors in the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>The taller the mountain, the higher one&rsquo;s ranking was.<br>Yin Buyu and Jiang Changkong were originally already on bad terms with one another, and for it to be officially declared in such a manner before the crowd only served to further madden him.<br>In any case, the realization that this was a ranking made everyone curious as to whose name would appear.<br>Soon, a name appeared on the third mountain from the left.<br>Monstrous Herd Temple, Kui Wudi.<br>This name made the crowd tremble in excitement.<br>As compared to the Windmounting Sect and Yin Clan Manor, the Monstrous Herd Temple was more well-known and powerful, and it was publicly acknowledged to be a power second only to the Holy Light Clan.<br>If one were to just compare their influence, neither the Windmounting Sect nor the Yin Clan Manor was a match for the Monstrous Herd Temple.<br>&ldquo;What the hell! Is Daoist Niantian joking around here? How can I, Kui Wudi, be so weak? Is this my ranking?&rdquo;<br>But in contrast to the cheering crowd, Kui Wudi wasn&rsquo;t too happy about the appearance of his name. His reaction left the crowd chuckling a little. Some offered their consolations while others made fun of him.<br>That being said, Long Xiaoxiao, Yin Daifen, Fu Feiyue, and the others only grew more anxious after the appearance of Kui Wudi&rsquo;s name. They wondered if their names would appear, and what their ranking would be if it did.<br>Would it be a low ranking?<br>If that was the case, it would really be embarrassing.<br>But what they were even more so afraid of was for their names to not appear at all.<br>If their names weren&rsquo;t on any of the mountains, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that they weren&rsquo;t even a match for Yin Buyu and Jiang Changkong?<br>The answer gradually revealed itself as names appeared on the subsequent mountains. This was the order from the shortest to the tallest, the weakest to the strongest&hellip;<br>Yin Clan Manor, Yin Buyu.<br>Windmounting Sect, Jiang Changkong.<br>Monstrous Herd Temple, Kui Wudi.<br>Monstrous Herd Temple, Bao Yue.<br>Yu Heavenly Clan, Yu Yin.<br>Yu Heavenly Clan, Yu Hong.<br>Cloudsky Immortal Sect, Fu Feiyue.<br>Cloudsky Immortal Sect, Yin Daifen.<br>Dragon Clan, Long Xiaoxiao.<br>Up to this point, all of the strongest juniors form the Dragon Clan, Monstrous Herd Temple, Yu Heavenly Clan, and Cloudsky Immortal Sect had already appeared.<br>One thing about the ranking was that no one expected the juniors of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect to be ranked so high. After all, the Cloudsky Immortal Sect originated from a Middle Starfield, and it was the youngest of the four behemoths. Naturally, the populace didn&rsquo;t have as much of an understanding of them.<br>In fact, there were even some who felt that the Cloudsky Immortal Sect was inferior to the Windmounting Sect and Yin Clan Manor, so none of them expected their juniors to fare so well.<br>As for Long Xiaoxiao, while her name was not well-known in the Holy Light Galaxy, she was, after all, from the Dragon Clan. As such, no one really carried any doubts regarding her strength or talent. They were curious to see just what kind of power the junior of the Dragon Clan, Long Xiaoxiao, possessed to actually be able to be ranked in the third place.<br>At the same time, the crowd also began to look forward as to whose names would appear in the last two mountains.<br>Finally, a name appeared on the second-highest mountain.<br>Yu Heavenly Clan, Yu Lie.<br>&ldquo;Yu Lie?!&rdquo;<br>The appearance of Yu Lie&rsquo;s name caused a huge commotion amongst the crowd as the excitement in the air grew to a new high.<br>Yu Lie&rsquo;s name was simply too well-known that it was impossible not to tremble in agitation upon hearing it. That was the man who was acknowledged to be one of the three most talented prodigies in the Holy Light Galaxy back then!<br>Even the strongest junior of the Holy Light Clan, Shengguang Yu, was defeated in his hands!<br></p></div>
