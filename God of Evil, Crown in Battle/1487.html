        <div> - Qin Wentian Coming Out Of Closed-Door Training<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>The outsiders were only watching the lively excitement that was happening.<br>Only Chu Feng was able to sense how powerful the Infinity Edge that he held in his hand was.<br>It was struggling. Layer upon layer of ferocious emperor&rsquo;s might was pounding against Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand. It was as if it was telling Chu Feng to scram, telling him that he was not qualified to hold it.<br>Even though this Infinity Edge was a copy and its emperor&rsquo;s might was not pure, Chu Feng still knew that it was a rare and high quality weapon that no Royal Armament could compare to.<br>Even though his Demon Sealing Sword was a very rare and high quality Royal Armament, it was still inferior to this Infinity Edge. No matter what, Royal Armaments were only Royal Armaments. No matter how high quality a Royal Armament might be, it would still be inferior to this Infinity Edge. That was because even though this Infinity Edge was a copy, and a copy of an Incomplete Imperial Armament on top of that, it was, nevertheless, an Imperial Armament.<br>At this moment, the Infinity Edge was struggling more and more violently. It was simply about to break free from Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm and fly toward the sky at any moment.<br>However, in this sort of situation, Chu Feng grew more and more joyous. The harder it was to tame this Infinity Edge, the more he liked it.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mine.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the smile on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face grew denser. With a single thought, his aura surged forth like a magnificent army of thousands of men and horses. Capable of toppling the mountains and overturning the sea, his aura surged into the Infinity Edge.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~~&rdquo;<br>At this moment, the emperor&rsquo;s might that was wreaking havoc through the skies suddenly stopped. The surging black clouds, the galloping lightning and the ear-piercing thunder also stopped. The sky had once again become still and quiet.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, the Infinity Edge in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand suddenly started to shrink backwards.<br>The emperor&rsquo;s might, the black clouds, and the lightning and thunder that had been wreaking havoc through the skies also shrunk backwards following this action.<br>In an instant, it was as if the entire sky had been absorbed into Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand. It was truly a spectacular sight.<br>At this moment, the sky had turned bright and clear once again. The peaceful daylight had returned. There was no trace of any black clouds in the sky at all.<br>However, at this moment, the people in the crowd were unable to calm themselves. They all knew that all of this had been done by Chu Feng, that Chu Feng had managed to subdue the Infinity Edge. Could it be that the Infinity Edge had recognized Chu Feng as its master?<br>As the crowd guessed, they turned their gazes onto the Infinity Edge. They discovered that the Infinity Edge no longer possessed the drive from earlier. It was obediently allowing itself to be held by Chu Feng. It had completely surrendered to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; is absolute submission?!!!&rdquo; Suddenly, an elder uttered a cry of alarm.<br>There were two different methods that an armament would use when recognizing its master. The first method was a cooperative relationship, in which the Royal Armament recognized someone and became willing to lend its power to be wielded by that person.<br>As for the second method, it was for an armement to be subdued by very powerful strength. The armament would then willingly serve under that master and no other.<br>The former would be a weapon recognizing its master, whereas the latter was known as absolute submission. The latter was many times more difficult to accomplish than the former.<br>Yet, the reaction of the Infinity Edge was precisely one of absolute submission.<br>It was extremely difficult for one to make an Imperial Armament recognize one as its master to begin with. As for absolute submission, it was something that was extremely rare. Yet&hellip; Chu Feng had managed to accomplish this feat.<br>&ldquo;Genius, he&rsquo;s truly a heavenly genius!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Headmaster Dugu, little friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance is not only a fortune to your Cyanwood Mountain, it&rsquo;s a fortune to all of us from this generation. I seem to be able to see the emergence of a future overlord,&rdquo; Old Daoist Wuliang praised Chu Feng once again. Furthermore, he had praised Chu Feng very highly this time. It seemed that he was very fond of Chu Feng.<br>At the same time, the gazes with which the other headmaster-tier existences looked to Chu Feng had also changed. This youngster before them, the longer they knew him, the more pleasantly surprised they became.<br>To be pleasantly surprised in succession like this had made them envious of Dugu Xingfeng and the Cyanwood Mountain from the bottoms of their hearts. Why was it that they did not have a disciple as excellent as Chu Feng?<br>After this matter was over, Chu Feng impatiently returned to his residence. Lin Yezhou and the others followed closely behind him. They were all itching to celebrate for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You are Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Right at the moment when Chu Feng, Lin Yezhou and the others arrived at Chu Feng&rsquo;s residence, before they could even enter through the entrance gate, they were stopped by a young man.<br>This young man possessed the cultivation of a rank nine Martial King. His aura was very extraordinary. Furthermore, he was wearing the outfit of a Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s disciple.<br>&ldquo;Qin Wentian?&rdquo; Chu Feng had never seen this person before. However, with how powerful this man was, he immediately guessed that this man before him must be the Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s number one disciple, Qin Wentian.<br>&ldquo;It is indeed I. I saw all that happened earlier. You killed Qin Lingyun and defeated Nie Wan&rsquo;er and Nie Xi&rsquo;er. Very amazing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I&rsquo;ll definitely let you know who the actual number one disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain is, who the strongest disciple of the Nine Powers is,&rdquo; Qin Wentian said those words one word at a time. He was filled with confidence.<br>&ldquo;So, it seems like you have come to challenge me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve merely come to greet you. I must take care of those two bitches Nie Wan&rsquo;er and Nie Xi&rsquo;er first. After that, I&rsquo;ll come and take care of you,&rdquo; After Qin Wentian finished saying these words, he immediately left with his hands behind his back.<br>&ldquo;Brother Qin, it&rsquo;s been many years now. You&rsquo;ve finally left your closed-door training?&rdquo; Seeing Qin Wentian passing by, Fu Feiteng went up to greet him.<br>However, although that Qin Wentian clearly knew Fu Feiteng and Lin Yezhou, he completely ignored them. As if they were strangers, he walked past them with arrogance.<br>Being ignored, the expression of Fu Feiteng that had taken the initiative to greet Qin Wentian became ugly.<br>&ldquo;Truly arrogant. Even after all these years of closed-door training, he&rsquo;s still only a rank nine Martial King. Did he not know that Nie Wan&rsquo;er and Nie Xi&rsquo;er have also became rank nine Martial Kings long ago?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With his mere strength, he still dares to challenge Chu Feng? Just Nie Wan&rsquo;er and Nie Xi&rsquo;er will be enough to teach him a lesson and make him prostrate himself in submission,&rdquo; Lin Yezhou said in a very displeased manner.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;Senior brother Lin, senior brother Fu, you two know Nie Wan&rsquo;er and Nie Xi&rsquo;er. I&rsquo;m sorry for the inconvenience, but could the two of you go and find them and relay a message from me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s naturally doable. Merely, junior brother Chu Feng, what is it that you wish to have us relay to them?&rdquo; Lin Yezhou asked.<br>&ldquo;Qin Wentian is going to challenge them, and will most likely do it real soon. Tell them that they must seize this opportunity in which the headmasters of the Nine Powers are still present in the Cyanwood Mountain to prove themselves.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, please relay to them that they must not be careless when fighting against Qin Wentian. Tell them that that they should not conserve their strength, and that it would be best for them to go all-out and use their divine powers right away when fighting against Qin Wentian,&rdquo; Chu Feng said in a serious manner.<br>&ldquo;For real? There&rsquo;s a need to use their divine powers against that Qin Wentian? Isn&rsquo;t this going overboard for a small matter?&rdquo; Sima Ying asked with an expression of confusion.<br>&ldquo;Junior brother Chu Feng, can it be that you managed to notice something?&rdquo; Lin Yezhou discovered that Chu Feng&rsquo;s words were fishy. He knew that Chu Feng was someone who would not say something like this for no reason at all.<br>&ldquo;Qin Wentian has used a special method to conceal his strength. His actual strength is not that of a rank nine Martial King, but instead a rank one Half Martial Emperor,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What?! He actually&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing what Chu Feng said, the expressions of Lin Yezhou and the others immediately changed greatly. Evidently, this matter came as an enormous shock to them. However, they did not doubt Chu Feng. Instead, Lin Yezhou and Fu Feiteng turned around and began to proceed toward the direction of the residence of the Ten Thousand Flowers Garden&rsquo;s disciples.<br>As for Qin Wentian, he too had proceeded toward that direction earlier.<br>&ldquo;In that case, Qin Wentian should have gone to challenge Nie Wan&rsquo;er and Nie Xi&rsquo;er, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment, I&rsquo;m going too,&rdquo; Seeing that Lin Yezhou and Fu Feiteng had left for the Ten Thousand Flowers Garden disciple&rsquo;s residence, Sima Ying immediately started to run after them. She guessed that Qin Wentian must have gone to challenge the two sisters. Thus, she wished to go and watch the show.<br>&ldquo;Wait for us, we&rsquo;re coming too,&rdquo; The other disciples of the World Spiritist Alliance managed to react. Immediately, they also followed after Lin Yezhou, Fu Feiteng and Sima Ying.<br>At this moment, only Chu Feng and Su Mei remained. Compared to watching a show, Su Mei was more willing to stay with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, is that Qin Wentian really a rank one Half Martial Emperor?&rdquo; Without anyone else to bother them, Su Mei was finally able to address Chu Feng intimately.<br>&ldquo;He is indeed a rank one Half Martial Emperor. He has used a special method to conceal his cultivation. It should be some sort of drug. However, while he was able to conceal it from the others, he could not conceal it from me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, why are you helping Nie Wan&rsquo;er and Nie Xi&rsquo;er?&rdquo; Su Mei asked.<br>&ldquo;I merely do not like this Qin Wentian. I felt a feeling similar to the feeling that I felt from Qin Lingyun from him. The two of them are the same sort of people.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for Nie Wan&rsquo;er and Nie Xi&rsquo;er, although they are arrogant, I do not feel that their nature is bad. Thus, in the battle between the three of them, I do not want Qin Wentian to win,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;But, what if Qin Wentian does win?&rdquo; Su Mei asked.<br>&ldquo;If Qin Wentian is to win against Nie Wan&rsquo;er and Nie Xi&rsquo;er, I&rsquo;ll have him suffer defeat at my hands,&rdquo; Chu Feng said those words in a very relaxed manner. This was not arrogance. Instead, it was confidence.<br></p></div>
