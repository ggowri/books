        <div>: The Conflict in the Bun Restaurant<br>&ldquo;What? He&rsquo;s also an impersonator of Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>The waiter&rsquo;s words caught the crowd&rsquo;s attention.<br>The crowd turned to look at Chu Feng, only for their eyes to narrow in skepticism. They didn&rsquo;t think that the Chu Feng before them was the real Chu Feng. After having heard about Chu Feng&rsquo;s deeds, their mental image of him was either an incredibly vicious man or someone as ugly as a monster.<br>The upstanding gentleman before them didn&rsquo;t fit the profile.<br>Chu Feng was also surprised too. The only ones who could recognize him were those from top powers since the common populace had been confused by the fake portraits. He found it incredulous that a waiter had actually seen his portrait before.<br>&ldquo;You believe that I&rsquo;m Chu Feng?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course! I&rsquo;ve seen Chu Feng&rsquo;s wanted portrait before,&rdquo; the waiter replied.<br>&ldquo;Then who do you think is the real Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The one you&rsquo;re impersonating is likely to be the real Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s interest was piqued.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng is a vicious and ugly fellow. He has committed many acts of cruelty, but there&rsquo;s a reason behind that. After all&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The waiter&rsquo;s voice suddenly trailed off at this point. They were in the True Dragon Starfield, the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s turf, after all. He dared not to run his mouth out of fear that it might bring him trouble.<br>&ldquo;Why are you asking me that? Get lost if you don&rsquo;t have money for our buns. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll get a beating just like that fellow!&rdquo; the waiter said.<br>Despite the waiter&rsquo;s rude attitude, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t find him detestable. On the contrary, he actually liked the waiter&rsquo;s personality.<br>The waiter was only rude toward those who were trying to scam him, and he didn&rsquo;t blindly listen to rumors either. He knew that the Situ World Spiritist Clan was the one at fault here.<br>&ldquo;Take this.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng tossed a Cosmos Sack to the waiter before heading up the stairs.<br>The waiter checked the Cosmos Sack, and his mouth widened in shock. &ldquo;Customer, how many buns are you buying?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bring me ten boxes of every flavor,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Customer, you have paid too much. What you have inside this Cosmos Sack is enough to buy ten thousand boxes!&rdquo; the waiter exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m heading to the nineteenth level. Count that into the expenses, and you can take the leftover as your tip,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>He knew that the money he had inside the Cosmos Sack was enough for him to dine on the nineteenth level.<br>&ldquo;Waiter, it looks like you&rsquo;re off the mark. There&rsquo;s no way a person as rich as him would impersonate Chu Feng for free food,&rdquo; a person from the crowd said.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not an impersonator? Does that mean that he&rsquo;s the real Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>He was certain that the person he had just met fitted the wanted portrait from the Situ World Spiritist Clan. He had spent money to purchase the wanted portrait, and the seller confirmed that the person depicted in the portrait was the real Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Ey, it&rsquo;s a pity that I can&rsquo;t personally serve him,&rdquo; the waiter lamented.<br>There were waitresses specifically trained to serve customers on the nineteenth floor.<br>The nineteenth floor boasted a scenic city landscape. It was a spacious area, but Chu Feng was the only one occupying the place. There weren&rsquo;t many people in the world who would pay an exorbitant sum just to eat buns.<br>That being said, the service was amazing. The waitresses were all beautiful women skilled at receiving guests.<br>As soon as Chu Feng settled down in his seat, a waitress served him a platter of tea and snacks. These were items that couldn&rsquo;t be bought with money even on the other floors, but they were served for free on the nineteenth floor.<br>It didn&rsquo;t take long for the buns Chu Feng ordered to arrive.<br>Chu Feng opened a small gate to his World Spirit Space to deliver the food inside.<br>&ldquo;Delicious! The snacks are amazing, and the buns are marvelous! Ahhh, this is too scrumptious. I have never eaten such good buns in my life before. Our trip here isn&rsquo;t wasted!&rdquo;<br>Eggy stuffed the buns into her mouth one after another, thoroughly enjoying the food.<br>&ldquo;Milady Queen, you should slow down a little. I&rsquo;ll analyze the buns and make them for you if you ever crave for them,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;No thanks. I don&rsquo;t like the food you make out of spirit power,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;Why not? There&rsquo;s no difference in the taste,&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the heart that matters, understand? This bun was slowly developed over many years through careful refinement of the processes and the ingredients to achieve perfection. Do you think that what you have conjured out of spirit power at a whim can compete with it?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;Ah, you don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m putting my heart into the food. That&rsquo;d indeed be difficult for me,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t sure if he had the talent in cooking to emulate these buns.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m not asking you to personally make those buns. You just have to occasionally bring me here when you have time. Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t just send food in. You should try the buns too. They are delicious!&rdquo;<br>Eggy had stuffed her mouth so full that her voice sounded muffled, but it only made her appear even more adorable.<br>Chu Feng grabbed a bun and took a bite off it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s delicious.&rdquo;<br>It was then that two old men entered the nineteenth floor too.<br>One of them was wearing a blue robe and the other a white robe. Their faces were warped in viciousness, and the stench of blood was emanating from their bodies.<br>Fighting was commonplace in the world of cultivation. Cultivators wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to kill others over the smallest squabble. It wasn&rsquo;t rare for people to walk around with blood stench on them. Chu Feng had already grown accustomed to it, so he retracted his gaze after glancing at them.<br>&ldquo;Why is everyone talking about that Chu Feng? It&rsquo;s ridiculous how a brat is stirring so much trouble in the True Dragon Starfield,&rdquo; the blue-robed elder said.<br>&ldquo;Who cares? It has nothing to do with us. The Situ World Spiritist Clan is a bunch of useless things anyway,&rdquo; the white-robed elder replied.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;<br>The two of them burst into laughter. It was daring of them to mock the Situ World Spiritist Clan in their territory.<br>As they settled in their seats, the waitresses of the nineteenth floor served them a platter of tea and snacks, similar to what they had done for Chu Feng.<br>Ah!<br>A shrill scream echoed.<br>The blue-robed elder grabbed the hand of one of the waitresses and pulled her into his arms.<br>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t do this, esteemed customer. I am not that kind of woman.&rdquo;<br>The waitress was so horrified that tears were flowing from her eyes. This was likely to be her first time being demeaned by others.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean by that? Serve me well, and I&rsquo;ll bestow upon you a lifetime's worth of cultivation resources. You&rsquo;ll be able to become a powerful cultivator yourself. Isn&rsquo;t that much better than serving others here?&rdquo;<br>The blue-robed elder disregarded the waitress&rsquo; complaints. He held her firmly with one arm while sipping on tea in the other.<br>&ldquo;An old man like you should know some shame,&rdquo; Chu Feng said loudly.<br>He had grown accustomed to the injustices that happen in the world of cultivation, but he couldn&rsquo;t stand watching such filth right before him.<br>&ldquo;Brat, are you trying to meddle in my business?&rdquo;<br>The blue-robed elder rose to his feet and glared at Chu Feng.<br>At the same time, hundreds of people rushed up the stairs. They were the waiters of the restaurant. It was worth noting that they were all cultivators. The waiter whom Chu Feng had met at the entrance was also amongst the crowd.<br>However, they didn&rsquo;t make a move right away. They seemed to be waiting for something.<br>&ldquo;Esteemed guest, our Immortal Bun Pavilion only serves food. Please have some self-respect.&rdquo;<br>A middle-aged man walked over with his body cloaked in aura. He was a rank one Martial Exalted level cultivator.<br>It was interesting how a bun restaurant actually had a rank one Martial Exalted level cultivator holding the fort, but again, it wasn&rsquo;t too surprising considering how this was the most famous bun restaurant in this realm.<br>It was impossible for a restaurant to thrive without some power backing it up.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sour our mood and get lost,&rdquo; the white-robed man said without bothering to look at the crowd.<br>&ldquo;It looks like the two of you are asking for a beating?&rdquo;<br>The middle-aged man began making his way toward the elder with a hostile expression.<br>All of a sudden, the white-robed elder rose to his feet and emanated a wave of oppressive might.<br>Boom!<br>The walls of the nineteenth floor crumbled under the force.<br>The white-robed elder was a rank three Martial Exalted level cultivator, and he had released his oppressive might with the intent to kill. His attack was enough to kill all the waiters and the middle-aged man!<br>The other customers in the restaurant sensed his killing intent in shuddered in fear. Some of them even peed their pants. Even the rank one Martial Exalted level middle-aged man gasped for air out of fright.<br>All of them turned to look at Chu Feng. They knew that he was the one who had protected them even though he hadn&rsquo;t moved in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;Yet another nosey one.&rdquo;<br>The white-robed elder flicked his wrist and whipped out an Exalted Armament. He leaped across the air to swing his saber down on Chu Feng, fully intending to slice him into two.<br>Uwa!<br>Yet, the white-robed elder suddenly ricocheted back to his original position. His limbs were all bent in weird angles, but there was still a breath left in him.<br>&ldquo;D-do you know who we are?!&rdquo;<br>The blue-robed elder released the waitress in his grasp. As much as he was afraid, he was displaying his wrath at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the guests of Treasure Hall!&rdquo; the blue-robed elder shouted as he flashed the invitation token of Treasure Hall.<br>&ldquo;Milord, it&rsquo;s a misunderstanding!&rdquo;<br>The middle-aged man quickly put on a fawning smile. He clearly recognized Treasure Hall and the invitation token, and it compelled him to change his attitude.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill anyone who dares to butt in now.&rdquo; Chu Feng glared at the middle-aged man.<br>The middle-aged man immediately shut his mouth. He was afraid of offending Treasure Hall, but he knew that he would be killed on the spot if he dared disobey the young man before him.<br>&ldquo;Waiters, bring me a hundred boxes of all buns. Takeaway.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng tossed another Cosmos Sack to the waiter whom he had met at the entrance, who immediately rushed down the stairs to process the order. The other waiters, who didn&rsquo;t want to get involved in the conflict, also followed him.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the manager here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the middle-aged man.<br>&ldquo;Y-yes, I am,&rdquo; the middle-aged man replied.<br>&ldquo;How much are you willing to sell the recipe for your buns for?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Young hero, you want our secret recipe?&rdquo; the middle-aged man asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;Young hero, you have saved my life. I&rsquo;d be happy to give it to you for free,&rdquo; the middle-aged man replied as he took out a scroll and tossed it over. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that Treasure Hall&hellip;&rdquo;<br>His words trailed to a halt when he noticed Chu Feng&rsquo;s cold eyes.<br>Chu Feng grabbed the scroll, but he didn&rsquo;t forcefully try to compensate them. After all, he did save their lives, and that was a debt they couldn&rsquo;t put a price on!<br></div>
