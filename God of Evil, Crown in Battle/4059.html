        <h1>Chapter 4058</h1>
        <div> - Completely Terrified<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Eeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>Even more miserable screams began to resonate in the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>The screams reached every corner of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>However, although the screams were causing a massive commotion in the Chu Heavenly Clan, the people outside the spirit formation were unable to hear them at all.<br>Likewise, because of Lanfu Jianpeng&rsquo;s special martial power that had covered the spirit formation, the people outside were unable to see anything.<br>That said, the spirit formation being suddenly covered in a layer of black, the giant explosion, and the hole that appeared afterwards, had caused the crowd to be unable to keep themselves from wondering if something had happened.<br>As such, the outside of the Chu Heavenly Clan was also in a complete uproar.<br>The people from the various powers were all spiritedly discussing, analyzing, and making guesses.<br>Whilst all this was happening, a person was beginning to worry if something bad had happened.<br>&hellip;...<br>In terms of worry, the most worried person was not someone from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Instead, it was Lanfu Longping.<br>Lanfu Jianpeng, had come to the Ancestral Martial Starfield this time around, for the sake of collecting the blue ores.<br>Originally, Lanfu Longping had not planned to travel to the Ancestral Martial Starfield, as he had other important matters that he needed to handle.<br>However, unexpectedly enough, not long after Lanfu Jianpeng had left, the news of the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect being wiped out began to spread.<br>No one knew who the ape and the monkey were.<br>However, having seen Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape before, Lanfu Longping had a deep impression of them.<br>Upon learning what had happened to the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect, he immediately realized that things were bad.<br>Although the Nine Souls Galaxy was separated from the Holy Light Galaxy by the vast starry sky, Wuming Doutian had always reported back to them in a timely manner. In his reports, he would always include the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s current state of affairs.<br>They&rsquo;d recently received Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s latest report.<br>The report had informed Lanfu Longping, and Lanfu Jianpeng of Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s return to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, and had revealed his talent.<br>At the same time, it also informed them of the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s rebellion, as well as Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s death.<br>Lanfu Jianpeng had always considered the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield to be ants.<br>Thus, after receiving the latest report from Wuming Doutian, he declared that he would properly take care of the Chu Heavenly Clan, and the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>Originally, Lanfu Longping had not shown much concern for this. After all, if Chu Xuanyuan had died, even if Lanfu Jianpeng were to truly overstep his bounds, it would not matter.<br>After all, the mission the two of them had been tasked with, was to ensure that the Wuming Clan maintained control over the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s Starfield Master Realm, and continue to extract the blue ores for them until all the ores had been mined.<br>It was not only Lanfu Jianpeng who did not care about the life and death of other people; even Lanfu Longping did not care.<br>Simply no one, would&rsquo;ve imagined that not long after Lanfu Jianpeng had left for the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Lanfu Longping would learn of the news of a man and an ape, bringing ruin to the extremely powerful, Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect.<br>Furthermore, after he made inquiries about the man and ape, he learned that they greatly resembled Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape.<br>Because of that, Lanfu Longping panicked.<br>Both him and Lanfu Jianpeng were only minor characters, nobodies even, in the Blue Talisman Clan.<br>If they were to truly offend Chu Xuanyuan, who had already grown extremely powerful. Them wiping out the Chu Heavenly Clan would not only ensure that their clan was wiped out; the two of them would also definitely suffer greatly because of their actions.<br>Even if their Blue Talisman Clan was able to escape the calamity of death, the two of them would definitely be killed.<br>That was why he'd decided to set aside the things he needed to do, and rush over to the Ancestral Martial Starfield, so that he could warn Lanfu Jianpeng.<br>Unfortunately, he'd still been a step too late.<br>Lanfu Jianpeng had not only set off to wipe out the Chu Heavenly Clan, but Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son also just happened to be within the Chu Heavenly Clan at the time.<br>This news completely terrified him.<br>In order to prevent Lanfu Jianpeng from causing a disaster, not only did Lanfu Longping go all-out in his pursuit, but he even went as far as to use a forbidden technique to ignite his bloodline and damage his own soul so that he could increase his speed.<br>Lanfu Longping had also been using his special observation method to look ahead of him the entire time.<br>Finally, when he and Wuming Doutian came very close to the Chu Heavenly Clan...<br>&ldquo;Damn it! Damn it!&rdquo;<br>Lanfu Longping stopped all of a sudden. Not only that, but he also cursed out loud in fury.<br>&ldquo;Lord Longping, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;<br>Seeing Lanfu Longping acting like that, Wuming Doutian was completely confused.<br>He didn&rsquo;t understand why Lanfu Longping would suddenly stop when they were so close to reaching the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Too late, it&rsquo;s already too late. We didn&rsquo;t make it in time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That idiot Lanfu Jianpeng has already sealed the Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With his strength, he must&rsquo;ve slaughtered the entire Chu Heavenly Clan by now.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Lanfu Longping suddenly grabbed Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s shoulders with his hands.<br>His gaze became extremely fierce.<br>This was the first time that Wuming Doutian had seen Lanfu Longping show such a fierce appearance.<br>Compared to Lanfu Jianpeng, Lanfu Longping had always been a relatively good-natured person.<br>Not only did he not put on an air of arrogance, but he was also very easy to speak to.<br>However, when Wuming Doutian saw Lanfu Longping&rsquo;s currently fierce gaze, he suddenly realized that the Lanfu Longping he knew was a facade.<br>The terrifying existence before him was the actual Lanfu Longping.<br>In an extremely stern manner and with an extremely threatening tone, Lanfu Longping said, &ldquo;Wuming Doutian.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Chu Heavenly Clan has been wiped out.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, this matter has nothing to do with both you and me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is all Lanfu Jianpeng&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; must bear witness to this.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Wuming Doutian finally realized why Lanfu Longping was acting like that.<br>He was afraid...<br>He was afraid of Chu Xuanyuan, afraid that he would come for revenge.<br>That was why he wanted to shift all responsibility. He was so afraid that he did not even dare to enter the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I will definitely testify for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always treated everyone very well, and are not someone who tries to do things through force.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back then, when Chu Xuanyuan returned, Lord Jianpeng had wanted to personally take care of him. Milord, it was because of your dissuasion that we managed to stop him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo; Looking at things from this perspective, you can be considered to be Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s benefactor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, what happened here today had nothing to do with you to begin with. It is all Lord Jianpeng&rsquo;s personal doing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This subordinate will definitely testify for milord.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But&hellip; Lord Longping, what if Lord Jianpeng still hasn&rsquo;t massacred the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better that we go in and have a look. If he still hasn't begun his massacre, we can stop him from making this enormous mistake.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if he has committed this huge blunder already, this subordinate will still be able to prove milord&rsquo;s innocence,&rdquo; said Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;Right, what you say is very correct.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I was muddle headed, muddle headed,&rdquo; Lanfu Longping said repeatedly.<br>Seeing Lanfu Longping like that, Wuming Doutian sighed in his heart.<br>He knew that it wasn&rsquo;t that Lanfu Longping was muddle-headed. Rather, he was truly too terrified.<br>He was terrified of Chu Xuanyuan.<br>After coming to a decision, Lanfu Longping brought Wuming Doutian with him and continued on towards the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>For the sake of not causing any commotion, he did not directly breach the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s protective formation like Lanfu Jianpeng had.<br>Instead, he used his abilities to carefully tear apart the spirit formation and secretly make his way inside.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after Lanfu Longping and Wuming Doutian passed through the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s protective formation, and Lanfu Jianpeng&rsquo;s power that had sealed it, they were met with screams.<br>Hearing the screams, Lanfu Longping and Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s hearts immediately tensed up.<br>What they were worried about the most had occurred.<br>Lanfu Jianpeng had already begun.<br>However, they soon felt that something was amiss.<br>If Lanfu Jianpeng had unleashed a massacre upon the Chu Heavenly Clan, how could they only hear the screams of a single person?<br>Furthermore, the strong reek of blood that is expected from a massacre, was nowhere to be found. Instead, many living auras could be sensed.<br>Most importantly, Lanfu Longping thought the screams sounded like Lanfu Jianpeng&rsquo;s voice!<br></p></div>
