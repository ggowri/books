        <h1>Chapter 3346</h1>
        <div> - Two Divine Lightnings<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Wuming Gangxiong asked Chu Hanpeng, &ldquo;Is the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief truly sick?&rdquo; His gaze was very sharp, like he was interrogating a criminal. Being questioned like that, Chu Hanpeng felt an enormous sense of oppression.<br>However, he did not dare to show any sign of neglect toward Wuming Gangxiong. Thus, he hurriedly replied, &ldquo;Milord, our Lord Clan Chief is indeed ill. Otherwise, he would&rsquo;ve definitely come to welcome you personally.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who knows if something like this is true or not. Go and call your clan chief over, I will see if he is really sick, or just faking,&rdquo; Wuming Gangxiong said.<br>Once he said those words, all of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen started to feel both angry and nervous. They were angered because they felt Wuming Gangxiong&rsquo;s behavior to be excessive. However, more than their anger, they were worried that Wuming Gangxiong would deliberately make things difficult for them.<br>&ldquo;Milord, our Lord Clan Chief is currently unconscious. It is inconvenient for him to come here,&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng said.<br>&ldquo;Inconvenient? Unless he is dead, I cannot think of a reason why it would be inconvenient for him to come here,&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Hanpeng actually had the nerve to disobey his order, Wuming Gangxiong revealed a look of anger.<br>Seeing that Wuming Gangxiong was actually angered, Chu Hanpeng&rsquo;s face was covered in fear. However, he was at a loss as to what to do. He couldn&rsquo;t possibly drag their unconscious Lord Clan Chief there, could he?<br>After all, their Lord Clan Chief was currently poisoned. He felt that it was truly unsuitable for them to expose their seriously poisoned Lord Clan Chief to the Fang Heavenly Clan.<br>After all, the Fang Heavenly Clan was their rival, a hostile power.<br>If the Fang Heavenly Clan were to learn of their Lord Clan Chief being poisoned, who knew if they would try to press their small advantage and do detrimental things toward their Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Right at that moment, another voice sounded from the war chariot. &ldquo;Elder Gangxiong, I believe that the Chu Heavenly Clan would not deceive us. You shouldn&rsquo;t make things difficult for them.&rdquo;<br>Hearing that voice, the others from the Starfield Master Realm immediately stood to the side and opened a path from the war chariot to the plaza. Even someone like Wuming Gangxiong stood perfectly straight to the side in a manner akin to a guard.<br>At that moment, the crowd subconsciously turned their eyes to the war chariot. They realized that it seemed that Wuming Gangxiong was not the only grand character from the Starfield Master Realm that had come.<br>There was someone even more amazing present.<br>Whilst Wuming Gangxiong and the others were standing to either sides, a figure emerged from the war chariot.<br>It was a middle-aged man with ink-black hair coiled on top of his head. He wore very simple and unadorned attire, but gave off an extraordinary air. Even though his appearance was clearly that of a middle-aged man, his refined silhouette gave of a feeling of grace and elegance.<br>At first glance, that middle-aged man simply looked like a novice scholar.<br>That said, when the crowd saw the middle-aged man, their expressions all turned to ones of great alarm. It was not only Chu Hanpeng and the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen; even the Fang Heavenly Clansmen and the people from the other powers hurriedly knelt to the middle-aged man.<br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to Lord Fenghuo,&rdquo; The crowd spoke in unison.<br>Wuming Fenghuo. He was one of the Starfield Master Realm&rsquo;s Ten Great Experts. As for the Ten Great Experts, their status was second only to the Six Great Utmost Exalteds.<br>The Ten Great Experts not only possessed great status, but they were also extremely powerful. Every one of them were peak Exalted-level existences a step away from becoming unsurpassed Utmost Exalted's.<br>Even though the crowd had realized that there was someone with even greater status than Wuming Gangxiong present when his voice was heard, they never imagined that it would be Wuming Fenghuo.<br>The reason for that was because both Wuming Fenghuo&rsquo;s status and strength were simply too powerful. An existence like him simply wouldn&rsquo;t participate in something like that.<br>Ever since Chu Xuanyuan was imprisoned, never had someone of Wuming Fenghuo&rsquo;s caliber ever appeared in the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Lord Fenghuo, never would we ever have imagined that you would honor our Chu Heavenly Clan with your presence. It is truly the privilege of our entire Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>Chu Hanqing and the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen began to openly flatter Wuming Fenghuo.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, you may rise,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo gestured with his hand. Compared to Wuming Gangxiong, he looked much more amiable and approachable.<br>However, the crowd all knew very well how powerful that Wuming Fenghuo was. Faced with someone of his caliber, even if he was amiable and approachable, the crowd would still not dare to act careless or disrespectful.<br>&ldquo;Actually, do not be joyous too soon. Perhaps our arrival today might not be a good thing for your Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I hope that your clan&rsquo;s younger generations have prepared themselves for the match today,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Hanpeng and the others all grew tense.<br>Wuming Fenghuo&rsquo;s intention was very clear. They had come to preside over the match. The result of which, would determine the ownership of the Purple Tree Ordinary Realm.<br>Evidently, the Fang Heavenly Clan had prepared themselves. However, their Chu Heavenly Clan had not. With the upcoming match, their Chu Heavenly Clan was destined to lose their ownership over the Purpletree Ordinary Realm.<br>They would lose the property left behind by their ancestor.<br>&ldquo;Milord, our clan is already prepared. Merely, I wonder&hellip; how will the match be conducted?&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng braced himself.<br>&ldquo;Actually, I have only come here to enjoy the fun, as this place just so happened to be on my way. As such, Elder Gangxiong will be the one to preside over this match,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo gestured.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, a loud explosion was suddenly heard. Turning toward the sound, a vast amount of dazzling multi-colored lightnings had gathered in the highest sky. With imposing power, they struck down deep within the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Due to the fact that the lightning was simply too dazzling, the crowd&rsquo;s eyes were all captured by it. Even Wuming Gangxiong and Wuming Fenghuo were no exception.<br>&ldquo;Is there someone undergoing closed-door training within your clan?&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo asked.<br>&ldquo;Milord, that is not lightning from reaching a breakthrough in cultivation. Instead, there is someone within our clan who has committed an enormous crime. Currently, that person is on the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform, and receiving his punishment,&rdquo; Chu Hanqing immediately replied.<br>&ldquo;Oh? So that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; Hearing those words, Wuming Fenghuo nodded.<br>He knew about the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform. It was actually something that many Heavenly Clans used.<br>The Heavenly Lightning of the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform struck from the ninth heaven. It greatly resembled the tribulation lightning caused by Self-Punishment Mysterious Techniques.<br>Although the might of the lightning strike from earlier was very extraordinary, and over a hundred times more astonishing than ordinary tribulation lightning, such lightning would occasionally emerge from the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform. Thus, it was not surprising for it to appear.<br>Thus, Wuming Fenghuo did not ask too much. It was just like how he did not ask why the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had fallen ill.<br>The reason for that was because he had purely come here to enjoy the show, and was not at all interested in matters of the people or the business of the Chu Heavenly Clan. Not to mention someone being punished in the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform, even if the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief were to die, he would not feel the slightest bit of concern.<br>After all, to him, even the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was merely a nobody, unworthy of his concern.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please.&rdquo;<br>Being received by Chu Hanpeng and the others, Wuming Fenghuo, Wuming Gangxiong, the Fang Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the other grand characters were all brought to the honored guest viewing platform to be seated. As for Wuming Fenghuo, he was seated at the master seat that only the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was allowed to sit in.<br>There was nothing that could be done about that. After all, Wuming Fenghuo possessed great status. Not to mention the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief not being present, even if he were present, this master seat would certainly still be sat in by Wuming Fenghuo.<br>In order to show their respect, Chu Hanpeng and the other Supreme Elders did not plan to sit at all. Instead, like servants, they stood behind Wuming Fenghuo and Wuming Gangxiong so that they could serve them at any moment.<br>It was not that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elders were pretty and low. Merely, Wuming Fenghuo and Wuming Gangxiong were simply too grand; they were existences that they could not afford to offend, could not afford to neglect.<br>Suddenly, Wuming Gangxiong, who had been seated stood up. He was planning to announce the concrete rules regarding the match for the control of the Purpletree Ordinary Realm.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, another loud roll of thunder was heard.<br>This time around, the thunder was even more ear-piercing. Looking toward the direction of the thunder, the nine-colored lightning was even more dazzling than before, and its might was even more frightening.<br>Even though they were clearly very far away from the lightning, the crowd were able to feel that their surroundings were trembling.<br>Like the lightning strike before it, the powerful lightning that gathered in the ninth heaven struck down onto the same location.<br></p></div>
