        <h1>Chapter 5550: Prepared for Chu Feng</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>Written on the plaque was information concerning Little Fishy.</span><br><span>Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er urgently needed formation masters to maintain her formation armor. There was a slot available for each city, determined through a trial of deciphering formations. The one who deciphered the most formations would be granted the opportunity to visit the Star Sea Central City to maintain Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s formation armor.</span><br><span>This was a dream job for all formation masters.</span><br><span>Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er was currently fighting for the Star Sea Realm. Should she emerge victorious, everyone who had played a part in helping her would accrue great merit.</span><br><span>By the time Chu Feng arrived, there were three small palaces there simultaneously holding the trials. He headed to the palace with the shortest queue. His heart trembled in excitement as he thought that this opportunity was made for him.</span><br><span>Just as it was about to be Chu Feng&rsquo;s turn, a disdainful voice echoed, &ldquo;Oh? Isn&rsquo;t this the useless intermediate formation master? Are you going to give it a try too?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng knew right away it was the man with white brows. The latter had just stepped out of the palace with a heavy expression; his result appeared to be less than ideal. It might be due to a desire to vent his frustration that he chose to provoke Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t pay him any heed, but that only further angered the man with white brows. Thus, he glanced at one of his followers.</span><br><span>The follower caught his drift and spoke aloud, &ldquo;Formation Master 521, why is your follower&rsquo;s face all bruised up? Did someone beat him up? You must have made a lot of enemies, and your follower paid the price for you. It&rsquo;s always said that one should first look at the owner before beating up the dog; I guess it can&rsquo;t be helped since you&rsquo;re too weak.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng finally turned his gaze over and asked, &ldquo;Were you the one who beat him up?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The follower immediately panicked. For some reason, Chu Feng&rsquo;s glare sent shudders down his spine. He glanced at the man with white brows, and the latter gestured that he would back him. It was only then that the follower confidently puffed up his chest and said, &ldquo;Yes, I was the one who beat him up. What are you going to do about it?&rdquo;</span><br><span>By then, the commotion had already caught the crowd&rsquo;s attention. They were smart enough to know that a follower would only dare to provoke a formation master with his master&rsquo;s backing. Given that Chu Feng was far weaker than the man with white brows, they naturally assumed that Chu Feng was going to be embarrassed here.</span><br><span>If Chu Feng made a move, the man with white brows would step in and subdue him. If Chu Feng refused to make a move, he would be shamed as the useless formation master whom even mere followers could mock.</span><br><span>The crowd was curious to know what Chu Feng would do in this situation.</span><br><span>Shoosh!</span><br><span>Chu Feng suddenly vanished, only to reappear in front of the follower an instant later. Everything had happened so fast that by the time the crowd could process what was going on, he had already smashed a punch right through the follower.</span><br><span>It was such a flabbergasting sight that it even shocked Chu Feng&rsquo;s own follower, 399.</span><br><span>399&rsquo;s injuries were mostly external, but Chu Feng&rsquo;s punch had crippled the man with white brows&rsquo; follower.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Y-you dare to touch my follower?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The man with white brows glared at Chu Feng with raging eyes. He was already prepared to step up for his follower, but who could have thought that Chu Feng would be so vicious?</span><br><span>However, the man with white brows&rsquo; expression froze up as soon as he met Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes. The latter was looking at him with frigid eyes induced goosebumps.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You were the one who ordered him to do that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked coldly.</span><br><span>Before the man with white brows could answer the question, he had already hurled another first forth.</span><br><span>Gah!</span><br><span>The crowd watched in horror as another cry of agony echoed.</span><br><span>Chu Feng had punctured the man with white brows&rsquo; spirit power veins with a single strike. This punch wouldn&rsquo;t take his life, but it had effectively ruined his future.</span><br><span>The man with white brows stared at his devastated spirit power veins in utter horror, knowing that he had been crippled for good. He had never imagined that he would pay such a heavy price for provoking Chu Feng. How could he accept such an outcome?</span><br><span>&ldquo;There was no grudge between us, but you had to court trouble. You were asking for this,&rdquo; Chu Feng said before he returned to 399&rsquo;s side and entered the trial palace together with him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;H-he&hellip; is at White Dragon God-cloak? He actually is at White Dragon God-cloak?&rdquo;</span><br><span>It was only after Chu Feng vanished that the crowd snapped out of their daze. Most people were shocked by Chu Feng&rsquo;s viciousness, but those from the Formation Master Hall who had insulted Chu Feng were flustered.</span><br><span>They were afraid that Chu Feng would exact vengeance on them.</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>Upon entering the trial palace, Chu Feng encountered a total of 39 formations.</span><br><span>These formations were unique in the sense that they could be deciphered with sheer skills regardless of the challenger&rsquo;s spirit power. While this might appear fair on the surface, the truth was that stronger world spiritists were bound to possess stronger world spiritist techniques.</span><br><span>However, Chu Feng was an exception to the rule. He was the World Spiritist Emperor Lord Qin Jiu&rsquo;s successor, not to mention that he had grasped some new tricks from deciphering the sea of energy beneath the realm.</span><br><span>The formations here hardly posed a challenge to him at all.</span><br><span>There was an old man seated inside the palace who exuded a formidable aura. He was clearly from the Star Sea Central City.</span><br><span>&ldquo;M-milord, you!!!&rdquo; 399 exclaimed with a stutter.</span><br><span>He was still startled by what happened earlier. It was one thing if it was just a small squabble, but Chu Feng had crippled both the formation master and his follower. This severe violation of the rules warranted strict punishment.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Rest assured, it&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile before turning to the old man.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, may I begin?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Mm,&rdquo; the old man replied with a nod.</span><br><span>The old man lost his composure as soon as Chu Feng began deciphering the formations. 399 was so shocked that his lower jaws slackened. The speed at which Chu Feng deciphered the formations was so fast that the two of them doubted their eyes.</span><br><span>In just the blink of an eye, Chu Feng had already deciphered 36 out of the 39 formations. By the time Chu Feng stopped, the old man was on his feet, staring at him with bewildered eyes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&hellip; actually deciphered 36 formations?&rdquo; The old man was taken aback.</span><br><span>He didn&rsquo;t know that Chu Feng was actually capable of deciphering all 39 formations, just that he noticed that the last three formations were far more difficult than those before. He knew that he would attract attention if he deciphered them too, so he held back on those.</span><br><span>In any case, he was confident that no other people would be able to decipher 36 formations.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Pardon my incompetence. I&rsquo;m afraid that this is the limit of my abilities,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>The old man&rsquo;s cheeks twitched. He had a feeling that Chu Feng was boasting, but there was nothing he could do about it. He first took a deep breath to compose himself before saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re 521, right? Wait at the entrance and don&rsquo;t stray too far away.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied before leaving with 399.</span><br><span>As soon as Chu Feng stepped out of the trial palace, a large group of elders and formation masters surrounded him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him! He&rsquo;s the one who severely injured those two!&rdquo; a formation master exclaimed with his finger pointed at Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Chu Feng recognized the formation master. He was on close terms with the man with white brows, and he had always played along whenever the man with white brows insulted Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How dare you conceal your cultivation and severely injure your colleague? What are you scheming?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The elders looked at Chu Feng with hostile eyes, ready to capture and interrogate him.</span><br><span>Just then, a calm and powerful voice echoed from the palace, &ldquo;This child has deciphered 36 formations, putting him in first place in this test.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The elders who were planning to capture Chu Feng froze in place. Those who were touching Chu Feng hurriedly retracted their hands, not daring to manhandle him any longer. The crowd also turned their eyes on him.</span><br><span>A person who cleared 36 formations was bound to be chosen for the slot. Who would dare to touch someone chosen by the Star Sea Central City?</span><br></p></div>
