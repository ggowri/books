        <h1>Chapter 4613</h1>
        <div>: A Fairylike Beauty<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three figures were no other than Chu Feng, Xia Yan, and Xiao Yu.<br>Under Dongfang Yunkong and Zhou Huofeng&rsquo;s lead, they descended at the square located at the center of the city. Dongfang Yunkong quickly stepped forward to announce the identities of the trio.<br>The mystery was revealed.<br>Chu Feng and the other two were indeed the ones who had cleared the trials and obtained the three slots for the matchmaking convention.<br>This made the faces of those from the Gongsun Clan darken. They were confident that those three slots were theirs, and the fact that things didn&rsquo;t go according to plan felt like a slap to their faces. They couldn&rsquo;t accept such an outcome.<br>And this was made worse by the mocking from those amidst the crowd.<br>Many of those seated in the distinguished guest sector knew ahead of time that the Zhuge Clan wasn&rsquo;t sending anyone over. As such, there were speculations that the Gongsun Clan could dominate all ten slots, but the outcome broke everyone&rsquo;s expectations.<br>Who could have thought that the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan would be outdone by three nobodies? This indubitably made a laughingstock out of the Gongsun Clan!<br>Even the Wretched Black Demon, after taking a look at Chu Feng and the others, couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh heartily.<br>&ldquo;Interesting. Since everyone is here, let&rsquo;s begin the matchmaking convention then!&rdquo; the Wretched Black Demon said.<br>Dongfang Yunkong and Zhuo Huofeng quickly stepped away from the square.<br>Following that, seven figures stood up and walked up to the square. They took their places beside Chu Feng and the others, forming one straight row.<br>&ldquo;Are they all from the Gongsun Clan?&rdquo; Xia Yan muttered softly under his breath.<br>He voiced the very same doubt that Chu Feng harbored in his mind. Chu Feng had heard beforehand that the Zhuge Clan was assigned four slots and the Gongsun Clan three slots, but it didn&rsquo;t seem like anyone from the Zhuge Clan was around.<br>In truth, Chu Feng had been a little doubtful about this even while he was at the Incubation Forest. The Gongsun Clan had sent their people to participate in the trials at the Incubation Forest, which made the absence of the Zhuge Clan there particularly obvious.<br>Looking at it now, it would appear that the Zhuge Clan had no intention of participating in this matchmaking convention in the first place. It was worth asking why they weren&rsquo;t here though.<br>&ldquo;My beloved granddaughter, you should come out too. Your future husband is amongst them. Don&rsquo;t you want to take a look first?&rdquo;<br>Shortly after those words were spoken, a lady began descending from the sky. Even before she came close, one could already catch a whiff of a light fragrance coming from her.<br>This lady was dressed relatively scantily compared to most female cultivators, flaunting her skin that seemed to radiate light under the sun. Her short skirt that revealed her long, slender thighs and her slim waist, but it didn&rsquo;t make her look crude at all.<br>On the contrary, it only brought focus to her beautiful figure, entrancing all of the men present.<br>Chu Feng could vaguely hear the sound of men swallowing their saliva beside him.<br>One of them was from Xia Yan, and the other two came from a fatty and a tanned skinny man from the Gongsun Clan.<br>To be gulping only after looking at her figure, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but think that these men were far too inexperienced. While a lady&rsquo;s figure was important, Chu Feng thought that it was the face that completed one&rsquo;s looks.<br>It was just a pity that the lady&rsquo;s face had been concealed behind a veiled bamboo hat she was wearing, though the slight layer of concealment brought an air of mystery around her.<br>The veiled bamboo hat appeared to be some sort of treasure as no matter how hard Chu Feng looked, he found that he was unable to see through the lady&rsquo;s true face.<br>That being said, even without looking at the face, just the lady&rsquo;s figure was more than enough to satisfy most men. At the very least, eight of the men standing in the middle of the square were expressing great interest in her.<br>As for the other two, they were Chu Feng and Xiao Yu.<br>&ldquo;The gentlemen who have gathered on the stage today, allow me to introduce myself first. I am Qiu Yulin. I hope that you can give your best later on, for your performance will determine who I&rsquo;ll marry in the future.&rdquo;<br>Qiu Yulin landed right behind the Wretched Black Demon, and she started off by curtseying slightly to Chu Feng and the others.<br>In truth, even if she hadn&rsquo;t introduced herself, the crowd would have still known that she was the granddaughter of the Wretched Black Demon. As such, their focus was less on the content of the message but the pleasant tone of her voice. It was almost like the warble of a songbird.<br>&ldquo;A great beauty indeed. The rumors aren&rsquo;t exaggerated in the least!&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan gulped another two more mouthfuls of saliva after hearing that voice, and an irrepressible smile began creeping onto his face, revealing his bucktooth.<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t intending to pay Xia Yan any heed, but it just so happened that the two of them met each other gazes while Chu Feng was looking around.<br>&ldquo;Say, brother, why aren&rsquo;t you reacting at all? You can&rsquo;t be a woman, are you?&rdquo; Xia Yan asked in astonishment.<br>Of course, Xia Yan wasn&rsquo;t so foolish as to say those words aloud. He was communicating with Chu Feng through voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;That fellow on your right isn&rsquo;t reacting either. Why don&rsquo;t you ask him if he&rsquo;s a woman too?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied calmly through voice transmission as he gestured toward Xiao Yu with a look.<br>Surprisingly, Xia Yan obediently turned his gaze over toward Xiao Yu, and the two of them seemed to interact a little. However, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t able to read their conversation as they communicated via voice transmission too.<br>He only saw Xiao Yu shooting a cold glance at Xia Yan, as if warning him not to run his mouth.<br>&ldquo;Hehe, I&rsquo;m just joking around.&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan chuckled softly under his breath, thinking nothing of the matter.<br>&ldquo;Young friends, I&rsquo;m sure that you can see my daughter&rsquo;s beauty for yourself. No man can resist her charms. She&rsquo;s my treasure, and all of you are very fortunate to be given a chance to compete for this treasure.<br>&ldquo;If you wish to take my granddaughter&rsquo;s hand in marriage, you&rsquo;ll have to show your true capabilities. I won&rsquo;t allow my granddaughter to marry a useless man!&rdquo;<br>The Wretched Black Demon looked at Chu Feng and the others with a smile as he said those words.<br>Despite the Wretched Black Demon&rsquo;s terrifying appearance, he was not a cold man at heart. On the contrary, he was someone who liked to laugh. It was only unfortunate that his laughs tended to inspire fear rather than friendliness.<br>After making his speech, a few elders quickly took their positions around the square to construct a towering platform.<br>Looking at the gleaming, elegant platform, Chu Feng felt his heart sinking.<br>&ldquo;Is this it? Am I not going to be given a chance to enter the Asura Graveyard?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng sighed in disappointment.<br></p></div>
