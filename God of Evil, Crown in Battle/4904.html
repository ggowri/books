        <h1>Chapter 4903</h1>
        <div>: Rank Three Martial Exalted Level<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What nonsense are you spouting? How could Chu Feng be dead?&rdquo;<br>Displeased at those words, Shengguang Xintian shot a sharp glare at Shengguang Qianyu.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just kidding. I&rsquo;m not close with Chu Feng, but my instincts tell me that he won&rsquo;t die that easily. I&rsquo;m just curious why someone like him isn&rsquo;t triggering the holy light phenomenon,&rdquo; Shengguang Qianyu replied jokingly.<br>Even he didn't think that Chu Feng would die in the lightning tribulation despite how scary it appeared. It was just that he couldn&rsquo;t think of any other possibility.<br>Soon, the crowd&rsquo;s eyes brightened up.<br>Two figures emerged from the Holy Light Ancient Formation and were heading in their direction. One of them was an elder of their Holy Valley and the other one was Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still alive. Did he succeed in making a breakthrough?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he did, why wasn&rsquo;t the holy light phenomenon triggered?&rdquo;<br>The crowd stared at Chu Feng intently, and they swiftly noticed that his previous weakness had disappeared without a trace. He looked energetic, as if he had really succeeded in making a breakthrough.<br>Shengguang Buyu, Daoist Niantian, Shengguang Shishen, and the others quickly rushed forward to welcome him.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, how did it go?&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu asked anxiously.<br>He wanted to know if Chu Feng had really made a breakthrough.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for providing me such a good cultivation area, elder. If not for that, I might not have been able to make such a smooth breakthrough.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng clasped his fist toward Shengguang Buyu as an expression of gratitude.<br>Just like the other juniors, Chu Feng had undergone the three phases of the cultivation realm, but what he had obtained far surpassed the others, especially in terms of trial and fortune. Due to that, he was able to find an impetus to make a breakthrough.<br>That was also why he told Long Xiaoxiao that he could recover within two hours.<br>A breakthrough in the cultivation could cause his body to be born anew, healing him in a way that recovery medicine couldn't hope to. He would be able to revert back to normal just by making a breakthrough.<br>The cultivation area Shengguang Buyu had brought him to had enhanced his intelligence, allowing him to make a breakthrough much easier.<br>&ldquo;That means that young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation has already reached rank three Martial Exalted level?&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>He even released a whiff of his aura to prove it.<br>The crowd was shocked by his aura.<br>Even though they had guessed it, they still felt conflicted upon sensing Chu Feng&rsquo;s rank three Martial Exalted level aura.<br>This was especially so for the juniors of the Holy Valley. They were already weaker than Chu Feng before, and now they were yet another step behind him.<br>&ldquo;Congratulations to young friend Chu Feng for taking another step further in your cultivation. Pardon me, but I have a doubt. Did you make a breakthrough because you were already on the verge of it, or does this have something to do with the cultivation realm inside the Holy Lotus Tree?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Buyu got straight to the point. He was extremely curious about this.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s thanks to the benefits I&rsquo;ve received from the cultivation realm inside the Holy Lotus Tree that I was able to make a breakthrough. So, I have to thank the Holy Valley for providing me with this opportunity,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to thank us. You were able to benefit more from the cultivation realm because of your superior intelligence,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu replied.<br>There were many juniors who entered the cultivation realm and obtained benefits from it, but Chu Feng was the only one who managed to acquire the impetus to make a breakthrough. This highlighted the huge difference between him and the other juniors of the Holy Valley.<br>&ldquo;Elder, you&rsquo;re flattering me. It was just a coincidence,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Old man Baimei.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Shishen suddenly shot Shengguang Baimei a look.<br>Shengguang Baimei immediately caught the drift and squeezed out a strained smile.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, I apologize for my previous offense. As a token of my apology, our Holy Valley has specially prepared three Exalted Armements for you. These three Exalted Armaments are superior treasures of our Holy Valley, forged by a top-notch world spiritist in the Ancient Era. Please, feel free to pick one that&rsquo;s suited for you.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei waved his sleeves grandly, and three Exalted Armaments floated toward Chu Feng.<br>All three of the Exalted Armaments were swords, and they emanated the aura of the Ancient Era.<br>Shengguang Baimei wasn&rsquo;t lying. These three Exalted Armaments were indeed top-notch weapons from the Ancient Era. While they came nowhere close in comparison to the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword, there was no doubt that they were superior goods amongst Exalted Armaments.<br>Even though Chu Feng already had the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword, he was still moved by Shengguang Baimei&rsquo;s offer. They were invaluable treasures that were worth keeping even if he didn&rsquo;t use them.<br>So, Chu Feng began to examine the three Exalted Armaments carefully.<br>One was a golden sword, one was a silver sword, and one was a white sword.<br>The golden sword was a great sword that was ten centimeters thick and three meters long. It had a coiling dragon inscribed on its surface. The dragon looked incredibly realistic, and if one were to listen closely, one could vaguely hear a dragon&rsquo;s roar coming from it.<br>Powerful weapons tended to possess spirituality, and such was the case for this sword.<br>&ldquo;This sword is called the Coiling Dragon Greatsword. It was forged out of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s adamantine metal, and it has a Golden Flood Dragon sealed inside it. The flood dragon used to be an incredibly powerful cultivator, ruling over billions of monstrous beasts. It possesses a body comparable to real dragons despite being a flood dragon, and that grants the sword an aggressive nature.<br>&ldquo;This sword has a similar nature to young hero Chu Feng, so I think it&rsquo;s the most suited to you.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei quickly introduced the sword to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng nodded his head slightly before turning his eyes toward the silver sword.<br>The silver sword wasn&rsquo;t as eye-catching as the Coiling Dragon Greatsword, but if one were to take a close look, its workmanship was even more exquisite than the Coiling Dragon Greatsword.<br>It had a phoenix subtly inscribed on it, such that it was impossible to see it without taking a close look. However, those who did see the phoenix would immediately sense just how powerful it was. It had a strong murderous intent that overwhelmed even that of the Golden Flood Dragon.<br>&ldquo;This sword is known as the Demon Phoenix Sword. It&rsquo;s said that the existence sealed within the sword possesses the Phoenix Bloodline, and it used to be a Monstrous Beast Monarch back in its era. It was reticent but frighteningly bloodthirsty. Countless have died in its hands.<br>&ldquo;It was later defeated by a world spiritist, but the world spiritist didn&rsquo;t kill it. Instead, he chose to seal it inside this sword. The existence might have lost its main body, but its bloodthirst continues to persist inside the sword. In fact, this sword will affect its wielder&rsquo;s mind.<br>&ldquo;To be frank with you, young hero Chu Feng, an elder of our Holy Valley has once used this sword. He was a skilled swordsman who was able to bring this sword to its fullest potential. Everyone thought that the elder had managed to subdue the existence sealed within the sword, but one day, that elder suddenly stabbed his own dantian with this sword, resulting in his death. We don&rsquo;t know the exact reason behind that, but we believe that it has something to do with this sword. Many others have tried to wield the sword afterward, but none was able to bring out its true prowess.<br>&ldquo;Even though this Demon Phoenix Sword has a humble appearance, it&rsquo;s the hardest one to control of the three swords. I personally don&rsquo;t recommend young hero Chu Feng to choose this one. As powerful as it is, it&rsquo;s highly dangerous as well,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>Shengguang Baimei was trying to dissuade Chu Feng from choosing the Demon Phoenix Sword, but his words only piqued Chu Feng&rsquo;s interest. He began examining the sword closely before nodding in approval.<br>&ldquo;Good sword.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
