        <h1>Chapter 5408</h1>
        <div><span>: This Fellow is Ill</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>Chu Feng took out his Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk, but the latter didn&rsquo;t provide him any guidance. He grumbled in dissatisfaction, &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t helping me this time too?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Even without relying on any special observation means, Chu Feng could already tell that </span><span>there was something amiss about this place. The Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk would have been a huge help under such a situation, but the horsetail whisk only acted on its whims.</span><br><span>Chu Feng heaved a sigh, knowing that he could only count on himself. He activated the Heaven&rsquo;s Eye to check the situation. To his relief, he found some clues about this land.</span><br><span>He flitted into the Blackwither Forest while scanning his surroundings, as if he was looking for something. Moments later, he finally halted. His eyes were fixated on a specific spot.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a remnant here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;A remnant? Is it dangerous?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say. Let&rsquo;s go in and take a look.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng began constructing a couple of intricate formations to open the remnant. It was fortunate that he had significantly raised his spirit power in the Divine Inheritance Ground, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t have enough spirit power to construct the formations required here even if he had Lord Qin Jiu&rsquo;s inheritance.</span><br><span>Even so, it wasn&rsquo;t easy for him to open the remnant.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>With a loud rumble, a stone door surfaced from the ground and opened itself. This was a sign that Chu Feng had successfully opened the remnant.</span><br><span>Instead of entering the remnant straight away, he first scanned its interior, and his face turned grim. &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s inside.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is it the Black-feathered Specter?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t feel like it. I don&rsquo;t sense a malevolent aura. It feels more like a cultivator of the present era,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;A cultivator of the present era? Did someone else discover this remnant?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That is possible. Let&rsquo;s take a look.&rdquo;</span><br><span>To be safe, Chu Feng first constructed a concealment formation to hide himself before stepping into the remnant. The remnant turned out to be more complicated than he thought, and to make things worse, he could sense a seal being imposed on his powers.</span><br><span>This seal became increasingly stronger the deeper he ventured into the remnant, and it restricted not just his spirit power but his cultivation too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on, Chu Feng? Why is my cultivation being sealed off?&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Your cultivation is being sealed off too?&rdquo; Chu Feng was surprised.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You too?&rdquo; Eggy grasped the implied meaning behind Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, I didn&rsquo;t mention it to avoid worrying you. Who could have thought that the remnant&rsquo;s restriction would be so great that it would seal your cultivation too? My concealment formation has also worn off too,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Should we retreat first?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Eggy was worried for Chu Feng. Now that his cultivation and spirit power had been sealed off, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to react to any danger that came his way.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That might not be possible anymore. We are already in the middle of a complicated labyrinth. We won&rsquo;t be able to return from the same path we came from,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a labyrinth?&rdquo; Eggy exclaimed with a frown. She didn&rsquo;t notice that at all.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I have found quite some clues. We&rsquo;re currently in the trial. Once we clear the trial, we&rsquo;ll be able to choose whether to advance or retreat.&rdquo; Chu Feng remained confident despite the dangerous position he was in.</span><br><span>He had been paying close attention to his surroundings, and his meticulousness paid off as there were clues on the walls of the labyrinth. These clues were fragments of a unique formation deciphering method that could be constructed even with one&rsquo;s spirit power sealed. Once he acquired all of the fragments, he would be able to construct the formation and clear this trial.</span><br><span>Thus, Chu Feng continued paying close attention to his surroundings. He walked to the end of the long corridor, and just as he was about to make a turn, his eyes suddenly narrowed.</span><br><span>A dashing young man with boyish looks was standing in front of him. He had a tall stature and an explosively muscular physique that was apparent even through his loose robes.</span><br><span>The young man had also noticed Chu Feng by this point and was assessing him with a lofty gaze, much to Chu Feng&rsquo;s displeasure. This young man was yet another arrogant fellow with his head in the clouds.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the young man asked with a forceful tone as if he was interrogating Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who</span><br><br><span>are you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me?&rdquo; The young man was surprised.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Am I supposed to know you?&rdquo; Chu Feng scoffed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh hoh! Why are you looking at me like that? Are you that girl&rsquo;s companion?&rdquo; The young man glared at Chu Feng in enmity.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Girl? Which girl are you talking about?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked. He was not afraid of the other party, but he thought that he should at least get to the bottom of things before fighting.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who else could I possibly be talking about other than that girl?&rdquo; the young man said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What in the world are you saying? Can&rsquo;t you be more direct?&rdquo; Chu Feng was starting to lose his patience at the other party&rsquo;s roundabout way of speaking.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I should have never expected much out of someone on this backward land. Lad, take a good look at my face. You&rsquo;ll soon realize just what kind of a great person you have encountered here. You&rsquo;ll feel so much regret that you&rsquo;ll shed tears even in your sleep,&rdquo; the young man said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why would I?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why? Isn&rsquo;t that obvious? You&rsquo;ll regret not fawning on me!&rdquo; the young man said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng burst into laughter. Moments later, he calmed down and asked, &ldquo;So, who in the world are you? What brought you here?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;You want to know who I am? Too bad, I won&rsquo;t tell you. I want you to regret having missed this precious opportunity. Farewell! Hahahaha!&rdquo;</span><br><span>With a hearty laugh, the young man turned around and sprinted away. His movements were so fast as if he was afraid that Chu Feng would chase after him. It took only a moment for him to disappear by the next corner.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is that person sick in the head?&rdquo; Eggy berated.</span><br><span>Chu Feng noticed that the young man was very fast despite having his cultivation sealed. Someone who was able to move this fast despite the restraints was bound to have cultivated to a certain level. In fact, Chu Feng thought that there was a high chance that the young man would have been even stronger than him without the seal on their cultivation.</span><br><span>It seemed like the young man wasn&rsquo;t just empty words.</span><br></p></div>
