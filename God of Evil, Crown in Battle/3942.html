        <div> - Even More Terrifying<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, the Scarlet Wind Pavilion&rsquo;s disciples began arguing.<br>The people who had begged for Chu Feng&rsquo;s assistance felt that, no matter what, even if it was only a single iota of a chance, they must still try. That was why they went to ask for Chu Feng&rsquo;s help.<br>As for the other side, they felt that there was simply no need to request help from someone who did not possess the ability to help them. They felt that doing so would only disgrace their Scarlet Wind Pavilion.<br>With the situation like that, the bystanders were at a loss as to what to do.<br>As they looked to the dying Mu Ziwei, the crowd felt even greater distress and pain.<br>They were able to tell that if the situation continued, she would not be able to last for more than two hours.<br>The Scarlet Wind Pavilion would not be able to find an expert to assist them in time. Besides, they didn&rsquo;t have any Saint-cloak World Spiritists.<br>Evidently, Mu Ziwei was beyond help. Many people had already determined that she would die.<br>However, at the moment when the crowd were accepting Mu Ziwei&rsquo;s misfortune, Chu Feng suddenly opened his eyes.<br>No one noticed that his hands were still placed together. However, people noticed that Chu Feng was walking toward Mu Ziwei.<br>&ldquo;Step back! Do not get close!&rdquo;<br>Upon discovering Chu Feng&rsquo;s movement, the Scarlet Wind Pavilion&rsquo;s disciples that didn&rsquo;t want his help immediately stood before Mu Ziwei, blocking Chu Feng.<br>Not only did they not intend to have Chu Feng approach Mu Ziwei, but they even had fierce and ill-intended expressions on their faces.<br>&ldquo;Scram.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng did not bother with superfluous words. He merely let out a cold snort. Then, with a boom, his boundless oppressive might swept forth like a tornado.<br>How could those Scarlet Wind Pavilion disciples blocking his path possibly be able to withstand his oppressive might?<br>Not only were their defenses completely ineffective before his oppressive might, but they were also blown away like a bunch of leaves. They were simply unable to resist Chu Feng&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>When they landed, they were all grimacing in pain. All of them had suffered broken bones.<br>However, one must know that this was the result of Chu Feng being lenient towards them.<br>Otherwise, his oppressive might was more than capable of obliterating their bodies and souls completely.<br>However, those Scarlet Wind Pavilion&rsquo;s disciples were not appreciative of Chu Feng&rsquo;s leniency at all.<br>Perhaps the Exalted realm would bring fear to others.<br>However, those disciples, with the Scarlet Wind Pavilion as their backer, were not afraid of Exalted.<br>Thus, although there was fear in their eyes, they were more angry. Some among them even unleashed their killing intent.<br>They were so arrogant that they&rsquo;d simply lost all sense of rationality.<br>&ldquo;You damned bastard, you dare attack us?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you know who we are?! We are disciples of the Scarlet Wind Pavilion!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you think you could bully us just because you&rsquo;re an Exalted?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong! Today, you&rsquo;ve provoked people that you cannot afford to provoke! You&rsquo;re dead! You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Being arrogant, the disciples from the Scarlet Wind Pavilion simply did not know how high the sky was and how deep the earth was. Frantically, they were venting their anger and shouting curses and insults nonstop at Chu Feng.<br>However, as they continued to shout, they suddenly, at the same time, turned mute!<br>Their mouths were still open. However, they were unable to say anything.<br>The expressions on their faces were more than simple astonishment. They were simply appalled.<br>It was not only them. Everyone else present was also stunned.<br>They were able to see bright spirit power covering Mu Ziwei&rsquo;s body like saintly light.<br>That spirit power was so very powerful. At the instant the spirit power appeared, everyone could sense how powerful it was.<br>Even though the cultivation of the people present were limited, they were still able to recognize that the bright spirit power was Saint-level.<br>Furthermore, it was Snake Mark Saint-level.<br>The Snake Mark Saint-level spirit power was being released from Chu Feng&rsquo;s palms!<br>Spirit power was flowing from Chu Feng's hands in an unending stream. The spirit power soon covered Mu Ziwei and assimilated into her body.<br>That was no ordinary spirit power. Instead, it was a spirit formation.<br>Being treated by Chu Feng, the poison began to be expunged from Mu Ziwei's body. Then, she began to recover.<br>At that moment, the crowd, regardless of whether they were scared or astonished, were all speechless.<br>Compared to Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation, his world spirit techniques were even more astonishing.<br>Chu Feng was not an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Instead, he was a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>While the disciples of the Scarlet Wind Pavilion paid no attention to his Exalted realm cultivation, they could not disregard a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Saint-cloak World Spiritists were extremely rare in the All-heaven Starfield.<br>Thus, not to mention Snake Mark, even Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists were existences very few people would dare to offend.<br>The disciples of the Scarlet Wind Pavilion had personally witnessed their Lord Pavilion Master, an Utmost Exalted-level expert, being extremely courteous towards an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Because of this, they came to a sudden realization that the person standing before them was actually a World Spiritist Grandmaster that they could not afford to provoke!<br>Because of that, they were completely terrified. Their minds went blank. They were unable to even speak, unable to even beg for forgiveness.<br>They reacted like a bunch of criminals that had committed capital offenses, and were waiting for their executions. They lacked even the strength to resist.<br>&ldquo;Asura. I remember now. You&rsquo;re that Asura, that Lord Asura.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, I&rsquo;ve heard of you, I&rsquo;ve heard of you before.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, an old man let out a cry of alarm.<br>That old man&rsquo;s cry of alarm successfully invoked the crowd&rsquo;s interest.<br>At that moment, everyone turned their gazes to him.<br>However, the old man simply ignored the crowd. Instead, he was staring at Chu Feng with an incomparable amount of passion in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Not long ago, it was you, Milord, it was you who defeated the Mystic Cave Saints, the eleven Saint-cloak World Spiritists, at the Red-dress Holy Land all on your own,&rdquo; said that old man.<br>&ldquo;Sssss~~~&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the crowd became even more astonished.<br>The reason for that was because they knew who that old man was. His daughter was an elder of the Red-dress Holy Land. Thus, the old man would always be the first person to learn about what happened in there.<br>As such, the crowd firmly believed in the things he said.<br>&ldquo;I heard that on that day, the numerous experts of the Red-dress Holy Land were all powerless to handle the Mystic Cave Saints.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even the renowned Grandmaster Duotuo was defeated by them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, Grandmaster Duotuo was defeated by the weakest person among the Mystic Cave Saints.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is you Lord Asura, who by yourself, defeated the eleven Mystic Cave Saints and helped the Red-dress Holy Land win the gamble.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Most importantly, I&rsquo;ve heard that Lord Asura is not even a hundred years old!&rdquo;<br>Although the old man had been astonished by Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength before, he was nowhere as emotional as he was at that moment. At that moment, he was so emotional that his hands were shaking and his voice was trembling.<br>He was truly emotional.<br>&ldquo;Not a hundred years old?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean he&rsquo;s a person of the younger generation?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions became even more marvelous.<br>The cultivation of a rank eight Exalted and the identity of a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>This strength was something that would completely eclipse even their All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s strongest member of the younger generation to a state of absolute unworthiness.<br>It was only then that the crowd present realized exactly what sort of character stood before them.<br>&ldquo;Never has this old man witnessed a genius of this caliber in his entire life. To be able to witness one today, it is truly the blessing of three lifetimes. This old man is truly fortunate.&rdquo; That old man was still endlessly emotional.<br>However, after hearing what the old man said, he was no longer the only person acting emotional.<br>The disciples of the Scarlet Wind Pavilion began to do their utmost to thank Chu Feng.<br>The bystanders began to flatter him as if their lives depended on it.<br>Even Pang Bo and his father were praising him nonstop.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s image in the crowd&rsquo;s eyes had once again risen to a higher level. He had reached a state surpassing that of mere mortals.<br>Even though everyone present were cultivators, they were acting like a bunch of mortals worshipping a celestial immortal.<br>Even Linghu Yueyue and Linghu An&rsquo;an were looking at each other with dismay and shock-filled eyes.<br>They were a bit familiar with a genius like that. After all, one such genius outstanding in both martial cultivation and world spirit techniques was also present in their Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Merely, upon comparison, the person before them was even more terrifying.<br></p></div>
