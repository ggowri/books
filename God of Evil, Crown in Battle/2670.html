        <div> - Frighteningly Powerful<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Father, you&rsquo;re toying with me, right?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked.<br>The reason she said that was because she was unable to believe that Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s strength was actually that powerful.<br>&ldquo;Does you father seem like someone who would deceive you with something like that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is something known by the great majority of the people in our Chu Heavenly Clan. It is only you all, the people of the younger generation, who do not know,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>&ldquo;If Chu Xuanyuan was that powerful, how could he be imprisoned in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked.<br>Chu Lingxi knew that Chu Xuanyuan was banished from the Chu Heavenly Clan over thirty years ago and imprisoned in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.<br>Thirty years ago, her father Chu Xuanzhengfa had been exactly nine hundred years old. Even if Chu Xuanyuan was sixteen years younger than her father, he must have been over eight hundred years old when he was banished.<br>If Chu Xuanyuan really possessed the power to become the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Law Enforcement Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master when he was only twenty-nine, what sort of strength would he possess when he reached over eight hundred?<br>It was very likely that not even the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and those Supreme Elders would be a match for Chu Xuanyuan, even if they were to join hands against him.<br>However, it was true that Chu Xuanyuan was imprisoned in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.<br>This precisely indicated that Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s strength was inferior to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s.<br>In short, all of this was very unreasonable.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, what do you think of the strength of the Dao Imperial Palace?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.<br>&ldquo;The Dao Imperial Palace? They possess very few disciples. However, they only accept elite disciples. As such, their overall strength is pretty decent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not counting our Chu Heavenly Clan, I feel that the Dao Imperial Palace could be ranked third amongst the powers in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, the current Palace Master of the Dao Imperial Palace, Daoist Golden Crane, is extremely unattentive of his duties.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I do not know why, but he actually went to a desolate place like the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to enter closed-door training. He became an arm-flinging shopkeeper, and stopped managing the affairs of the Dao Imperial Palace.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that wasn&rsquo;t the case, the Dao Imperial Palace should be able to be ranked second among the various powers,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>&ldquo;I truly couldn&rsquo;t tell that you actually knew about the state of affairs of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm so well,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi raised her head proudly.<br>&ldquo;In that case, do you know about the Dao Imperial Palace&rsquo;s previous Palace Master, Daoist Golden Crane&rsquo;s master?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.<br>&ldquo;I only care about the current state of affairs, and not things from the past. Furthermore, I have been undertaking missions all over the place, and rarely stay in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm for long. As such, how could I know about all those things?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, aren&rsquo;t we talking about Chu Xuanyuan? Why would you ask about all these other people?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said with her lips curled and a proud attitude.<br>Evidently, she had been baffled by her father&rsquo;s question, and was feeling very displeased because of that.<br>&ldquo;The Dao Imperial Palace&rsquo;s previous Palace Master, Daoist Jing Tian, was deemed to be the strongest Palace Master to have ever appeared in the Dao Imperial Palace&rsquo;s history.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You said it yourself. If you don&rsquo;t count our Chu Heavenly Clan, the Dao Imperial Palace could be ranked third in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it were during the the reign of Daoist Jing Tian, then the Dao Imperial Palace would be ranked first in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm when disregarding our Chu Heavenly Clan. Furthermore, they would be ranked first with absolute certainty.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When Daoist Jing Tian left for the Starfield Master Realm, he was&hellip; even able to stand on equal footings with our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, and receive the same sort of treatment,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>&ldquo;Equal footing? Same sort of treatment?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that the Dao Imperial Palace back then had managed to pose a threat to our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s position as the overlord of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Lingxi finally revealed an astonished expression on her face.<br>She knew very well that the Starfield Master Realm was the true overlord of this Starfield. Every year, the overlords from the various Upper Realms would have to proceed to the Starfield Master Realm to participate in the Starfield Governmental Assembly.<br>Apart from the overlords of the various Upper Realms, some experts who were famous across the entire Starfield would also receive invitations to participate in the Starfield Governmental Assembly.<br>However, regardless of how powerful those experts might be, they would not receive the same sort of treatment as the overlords of the various Upper Realms.<br>If something like that were to happen, it would mean that that person or that person&rsquo;s power had managed to pose a threat to their Upper Realm&rsquo;s overlord. Furthermore, that person or that person&rsquo;s power had also managed to obtain the acceptance of the Starfield Master Realm.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, they threatened our status.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back then, the Dao Imperial Palace was filled with ambition. They were issuing provocations at our Chu Heavenly Clan repeatedly, and seemed to be trying to set off a war to seize the position of overlord of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, how was the matter settled?&rdquo; Curiosity filled Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s beautiful eyes.<br>The reason for that was because something like this was very serious. For the sake of maintaining their status as the overlord of their Upper Realm, the overlords would generally beat down those powers that posed a threat to their status.<br>Under that sort of situation, a power that posed a threat to the overlord would either rise to the occasion, rebel against the overlord and fight over the position of overlord...<br>Or, they would have to cower to the overlord and make some sacrifices to neutralize the crisis.<br>Judging from the way the Dao Imperial Palace behaved back then, it was very clear what their intention was. They had planned to settle the issue of who the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s overlord would be through war.<br>However, no such war had occurred between the Chu Heavenly Clan and the Dao Imperial Palace.<br>That was why Chu Lingxi was curious as to exactly how the matter was settled.<br>&ldquo;It was Chu Xuanyuan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanyuan entered the Dao Imperial Palace by himself. Then, with no assistance, he defeated numerous experts from the Dao Imperial Palace.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even Daoist Jing Tian, who was deemed to be the strongest Palace Master in the Dao Imperial Palace&rsquo;s existence, was defeated by Chu Xuanyuan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not long after that happened, Daoist Jing Tian passed away. Because of that, the Dao Imperial Palace suffered a massive loss in strength. Naturally, they no longer posed a threat to our Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s eyes were wide open. Astonishment filled her eyes. Even her fair-skinned face had turned red.<br>She was shaken by Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s accomplishment. As a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan, she involuntarily felt fired up upon hearing of Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s accomplishment.<br>&ldquo;Father, in that case, how old was Chu Xuanyuan back then?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked.<br>Chu Lingxi felt that if the Dao Imperial Palace truly managed to pose a threat to their Chu Heavenly Clan, the Dao Imperial Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master should have strength equivalent to their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Even if he was weaker, he wouldn&rsquo;t be much weaker.<br>The fact that Chu Xuanyuan had defeated the Dao Imperial Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master back then meant Chu Xuanyuan was capable of defeating their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Or, at the very least, he would not be inferior to their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Thus, Chu Lingxi was very curious as to how old Chu Xuanyuan was back then.<br>Judging by his age, she could determine exactly how talented Chu Xuanyuan was.<br>&ldquo;Back then, Chu Xuanyuan was precisely twenty-nine years of age,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding!!!&rdquo;<br>The astonishment in Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s eyes instantly increased by several times. Even her &lsquo;you&rsquo;re kidding&rsquo; was said in a screaming manner.<br>She was truly startled.<br>&ldquo;Do you still think that I&rsquo;m lying to you?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa asked with a smile.<br>&ldquo;But, if Chu Xuanyuan truly possessed strength capable of matching our clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief when he was only twenty-nine years old, he should be far stronger than everyone in our Chu Heavenly Clan when he was arrested and imprisoned.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, how could he be willingly banished by our clan, and then imprisoned in the Ancestral Lower Martial Realm?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi had a puzzled expression.<br>She had started to somewhat believe the stories about Chu Xuanyuan. However, it was precisely because she had started to somewhat believe it that she was unable to understand.<br>A person who was capable of matching their clan chief at the age of twenty-nine was no longer a genius that appeared once every ten thousand years. Instead, he was most likely a genius that would not even appear once in a million years. Someone like Chu Xuanyuan was an actual demon-level genius, a person capable of changing the equilibrium of the martial cultivation world.<br>Someone like him would definitely have been able to advance his cultivation by leaps and bounds. When he was over eight hundred years old, what sort of strength would he possess? This was simply something unimaginable.<br>At the very least, Chu Lingxi felt that Chu Xuanyuan must have been extremely frightening back then.<br>The disparity between the strength of the Chu Heavenly Clan and Chu Xuanyuan must have been enormous.<br>The strength of the entire Chu Heavenly Clan was most likely inferior to Chu Xuanyuan alone.<br><br></p></div>
