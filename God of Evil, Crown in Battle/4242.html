        <h1>Chapter 4241</h1>
        <div> - Monster Among Monsters<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The characters &lsquo;Chu Feng&rsquo; were imprinted onto the flag.<br>Not only did it cause a commotion outside the Ancient Compliance Castle, it also caused a complete ruckus inside the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>Chu Feng had stood on the second step for an entire incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time already.<br>But, his expression was still completely unchanged. It was like he was standing on an extremely normal step that was unable to affect him in the slightest.<br>But, the gaseous flames that had enveloped him were things that the crowd present could not withstand merely by looking at it.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>Right when the crowd were astonished by Chu Feng, Chu Feng leaped again and arrived on the third step.<br>Once he stepped onto the third step, flames immediately rose from the third step.<br>The flames were emitting an extremely terrifying temperature. Even though the crowd were very far from it, they still felt like they were about to be melted by the flames.<br>Realizing that things were bad, those distinguished younger generations immediately backed away from the flames.<br>Some among them even began setting up spirit formations to protect themselves from the heat.<br>But, standing in the center of the flames, Chu Feng was completely undamaged. Even his clothes showed no sign of damage.<br>But, at that moment, a change in expression had finally appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>He was frowning slightly. A slight expression of pain and some sweat had appeared on his face.<br>But&hellip; that was all the influence the third step had on Chu Feng.<br>Why would this be the case?<br>Was there truly such an enormous disparity between individuals?<br>The people present, these people of the younger generation who had been deemed geniuses all their lives, found it extremely difficult to accept what was happening.<br>They were unwilling to believe that there was such an enormous disparity between them and Chu Feng.<br>If Chu Feng were to show an expression of pain on his face and signs of difficulty, the crowd would be willing to accept that Chu Feng possessed exceptional talent that surpassed theirs.<br>But, the expression that Chu Feng displayed on his face showed the crowd that he wasn't in too much pain.<br>The pain that was intolerable to others was actually nothing to Chu Feng.<br>This enormous disparity caused the crowd to become skeptical.<br>Was Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent truly that heaven-defyingly powerful, or could it be that the Talent Steps were malfunctioning?<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, someone leapt forth.<br>He leaped onto the second talent step directly and landed firmly.<br>Seeing that man do that, the gazes of everyone present left Chu Feng and landed on him.<br>He had seized Chu Feng&rsquo;s limelight.<br>The reason why he had hogged all the limelight was because his actions would reveal whether Chu Feng was truly exceptionally talented, or whether the Talent Steps were malfunctioning.<br>The answer would soon be disclosed.<br>But, there was an exception. Not everyone turned their eyes to him.<br>Old Man Compliance&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on Chu Feng the entire time. Even though he had also noticed that man challenging the second step, he did not even bother to take a glance at him.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhhh---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, that man started screaming.<br>Then, he fell from the Talent Steps.<br>When he landed, his body appeared to have been scalded, and was deep red.<br>He lay on the ground and did not even have the strength to crawl back up. He was vomiting nonstop. His blood was mixed with his vomit. It was truly disgusting.<br>But, more importantly, the man&rsquo;s current condition looked extremely terrible.<br>From the way he looked, he might even end up losing his life.<br>Yet, no one dared step forward to help him. Even though the man had fallen from the Talent Steps, there were still white gaseous flames lingering on his body.<br>The white gaseous flames on him were the same as the ones on the Talent Steps. They were what the crowd feared.<br>Without an alternative, some of the crowd turned their pleading eyes to Old Man Compliance.<br>Only Old Man Compliance would be able to save him.<br>Although the man was not as renowned as Yuan Shu and some others, he was still an outstanding talent among the people of the younger generation.<br>But, faced with the crowd&rsquo;s pleading eyes, Old Man Compliance did not even bother to look at them.<br>Instead, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve warned all of you before. If you&rsquo;re unable to stand atop the first step for two incense sticks&rsquo; worth of time, do not challenge the second step. If you do, you&rsquo;ll have to bear the consequences.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is the result of refusing to listen to my warning. It serves him right.&rdquo;<br>Once Old Man Compliance said those words, the noisy Ancient Compliance Castle turned absolutely silent.<br>Everyone turned to fix their eyes onto Chu Feng again.<br>As matters stood, all their guesses were answered.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that the might of the Talent Steps had weakened. Rather, it was Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent that had reached an unimaginable level.<br>As they looked at Chu Feng, they did not dare to believe what was happening before them. But, they had no choice but to accept it to be true.<br>As matters stood, they had to accept the fact that Chu Feng was challenging the Talent Steps&rsquo; third step. Furthermore, he wasn't in a lot of pain or experiencing much difficulty.<br>&ldquo;Is there really that enormous of a disparity between people&rsquo;s talents?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Zi Ling, I now understand why you&rsquo;re so dead set on him.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the current Chu Feng, Yu Ting&rsquo;s heart underwent an enormous change.<br>Yu Ting knew that even though the people present were all exceptionally talented among the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s younger generation&rsquo;s world spiritists, there was quite a disparity in talent between them and those monsters of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>One extremely simple matter could serve as the greatest proof of this disparity: Yu Ting.<br>Yu Ting&rsquo;s talent for martial cultivation would be ranked among the lower tier when placed in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>Although she had never had the chance to test her talent as a world spiritist, she felt that even though her talent for world spirit techniques surpassed her talent for martial cultivation, it was likely only medium tier when placed in a monster-filled place like the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>Because of that, Yu Ting was among the weakest disciples in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>But after leaving the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect and returning to the Holy Light Galaxy, Yu Ting had become someone with outstanding talent. She had successfully challenged the Talent Steps&rsquo; first step that had baffled most people.<br>From this, it could be seen that those so-called geniuses of the Holy Light Galaxy were simply nothing when compared to the monsters of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>But, Chu Feng was an exception.<br>Yu Ting felt that even if Chu Feng were to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, that place packed with monsters, he would still be considered a monster.<br>His talent not only greatly surpassed that of the other people present, it also greatly surpassed Yu Ting herself.<br>&ldquo;He actually really did it.&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s name gradually appear on the third step, the crowd, including even Old Man Compliance, felt a different sort of astonishment.<br>&hellip;...<br>At the same time. The outside of the Ancient Compliance Castle became exceptionally quiet.<br>Barely a voice could be heard in that previously noisey place.<br>Everyone was focused on the characters &lsquo;Chu Feng&rsquo; on the flag. They&rsquo;d been staring at them for a very long time, but were still in a state of astonishment.<br>&ldquo;He actually managed to conquer the second and third steps in succession.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He left his name on both flags.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly who is this Chu Feng? There&rsquo;s actually such a terrifying genius hidden in our Holy Light Galaxy?&rdquo; someone said all of a sudden.<br>Once those words were said, the extremely quiet surroundings burst into a complete uproar.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s name was once again being mentioned by everyone present.<br>Without a doubt, from that day onward, the name Chu Feng would most definitely be known throughout the entire Holy Light Galaxy.<br>An unprecedented genius had descended upon them!<br></p></div>
