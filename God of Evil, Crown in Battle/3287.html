        <h1>Chapter 3286</h1>
        <div> - Chu Feng Coming Out<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It had been a total of twenty-two hours since Chu Feng opened the Bloodline Altar.<br>Apart from Chu Feng, all of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations had exited the Bloodline Altar.<br>Unless they were to go into the depths of the Bloodline Altar, they would not be able to stay inside for an extended period of time.<br>As for how long they could continue to stay inside the Bloodline Altar, it was actually related to their talent. Those with weak talent might be forcibly removed by the Bloodline Altar in merely two hours&rsquo; time.<br>Even the most talented individuals among them, like Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu, were forcibly removed by the Bloodline Altar after ten hours passed.<br>That said, even those people that were able to enter the depths of the Bloodline Altar like Chu Feng would still be under a time restriction.<br>As for that restriction, it was twenty-four hours.<br>After twenty-four hours passed, Chu Feng would also be forcibly removed and sent out by the Bloodline Altar.<br>After another incense stick worth of time passed, Chu Feng would&rsquo;ve been in the Bloodline Altar for twelve hours.<br>At that moment, everyone was waiting for the time to arrive.<br>After Chu Feng exited the Bloodline Altar, and the Bloodline Altar closed, the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations might end up activating.<br>Of course, with Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent, everyone felt that he would definitely be able to activate the Bloodline Cultivation Formations.<br>The only thing that they could not be certain of was how many Bloodline Cultivation Formations Chu Feng would be able to activate.<br>The amount of Bloodline Cultivation Formations that Chu Feng would end up activating would represent how strong his talent was.<br>&ldquo;Brother White Dragon, very rarely have I seen you this nervous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you perhaps afraid? If you&rsquo;re afraid, I can pretend that you never said anything,&rdquo; the Saintly Stellar Monk looked to the White Dragon Demon Daoist with a beaming smile on his face, and spoke with a slightly ridiculing tone.<br>The White Dragon Demon Daoist curled his lips and responded, &ldquo;Humph, afraid?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, White Dragon, do not know the word &lsquo;afraid.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Saintly Stellar, look carefully. This horsetail whisk is in my hand. As long as that Chu Feng is capable of activating four Bloodline Cultivation Formations, this horsetail whisk of mine shall be yours.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well, that&rsquo;s a promise then,&rdquo; the Saintly Stellar Monk said with a smile.<br>Suddenly, someone pointed to the Bloodline Altar&rsquo;s exit and shouted, &ldquo;Quickly, look, it&rsquo;s Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the expressions of everyone present turned serious. Even the Saintly Stellar Monk and the White Dragon Demon Daoist were no exception.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng was walking out from the Bloodline Altar.<br>After he walked out from the Bloodline Altar, the entrance to the Bloodline Altar closed by itself.<br>Following that, the surging lightning that had covered the Bloodline Altar also began to dissipate.<br>Although the lightning that surrounded the Bloodline Altar did not completely disappear, it grew much dimmer than before.<br>At that moment, many of the people present were holding their breath.<br>The feeling of nervousness was present even in the surrounding air.<br>They all knew that the most crucial time had arrived.<br>Because Chu Feng had walked out of the Bloodline Altar, the Bloodline Altar had completely closed. Next, it would be time for the Bloodline Cultivation Formations to activate.<br>Exactly how many Bloodline Cultivation Formations would Chu Feng, the son of Chu Xuanyuan, be able to activate? Exactly what sort of talent did he possess?<br>The crowd were all waiting with expectations.<br>It was not only the crowd that was looking forward to it; Chu Feng himself was also looking forward to it. After Chu Feng exited the Bloodline Altar, he immediately soared into the sky. He wanted to witness everything that was about to happen close up.<br>Time gradually passed. Even though the lightning that covered the Bloodline Altar did not completely disappear, there was no response from the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations at all.<br>In the beginning, the crowd thought that some time was needed for the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations to respond.<br>However, the crowd waiting anxiously for an entire incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time. Yet, there was still no trace of response from the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations.<br>&ldquo;Say, brother Chu, normally, how long will it take for the Bloodline Cultivation Formations to activate?&rdquo; Impatient, the White Dragon Demon Daoist turned to ask the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;In the past, after the person who opened the Bloodline Altar walked out, the Bloodline Cultivation Formations that were activated would respond immediately,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Then, regarding the current situation&hellip;?&rdquo; White Dragon Demon Daoist asked.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening with Chu Feng is different from the past,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Different? Say, brother Chu, you don&rsquo;t have to comfort that Chu Feng. Evidently, he has returned empty-handed, and was unable to even activate a single Bloodline Cultivation Formation,&rdquo; the White Dragon Demon Daoist burst into sudden and loud laughter.<br>&ldquo;What? Chu Feng is unable to even activate a single Bloodline Cultivation Formation?&rdquo;<br>Hearing the White Dragon Demon Daoist&rsquo;s words, the previously quiet crowd immediately grew noisy.<br>Everyone began to discuss this matter spiritedly.<br>Could it be that Chu Feng really failed to even activate a single Bloodline Cultivation Formation?<br>But&hellip; that shouldn&rsquo;t be the case. Not to mention Chu Feng&rsquo;s father and grandfather, even Chu Xuanzhengfa had managed to activate a single Bloodline Cultivation Formation in his youth.<br>Could it be that Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent was inferior to even Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s?<br>The descendant of two exceptional geniuses, the strongest expert amongst the current younger generation, was actually this incompetent?<br>Was the disparity between this generation and the previous generations truly so vast?<br>But&hellip; Chu Feng was someone who had managed to ascend to the highest level of the Heavenly Lightning Steps.<br>&ldquo;Brother Saintly Stellar, it appears that you won&rsquo;t be able to obtain this horsetail whisk of mine. However, you shouldn&rsquo;t blame me for it. It&rsquo;s really that Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son who has failed to live up to your expectations. Hahaha.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boring. Boring. Brother Chu, I&rsquo;ll take my leave first.&rdquo;<br>The White Dragon Demon Daoist began to walk toward the exit of the restricted area as he continued to laugh at Chu Feng&rsquo;s misfortune.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, I&rsquo;ll also take my leave,&rdquo; the Saintly Stellar Monk clasped his fist at the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Then, he turned around and began to leave too.<br>Although Saintly Stellar Monk did not have any complaints regarding Chu Feng&rsquo;s character and thought very highly of him, the renowned Saintly Stellar Monk felt very uncomfortable after hearing the White Dragon Demon Daoist&rsquo;s cutting remarks.<br>As both the Saintly Stellar Monk and the White Dragon Demon Daoist were honored guests, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Chu Hanpeng immediately set off to personally see them off.<br>After those two grand characters, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Chu Hanpeng left, although the crowd was still spiritedly discussing the matter, they were also staring at the Bloodline Altar the entire time. They were hoping for a miracle to happen.<br>However, after another incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time passed, there was still no response from the Bloodline Altar.<br>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen burst into a complete uproar.<br>As the saying goes, the greater the expectations, the greater the disappointment.<br>This was especially true for the people that were planning to enter the Bloodline Cultivation Formations to undergo closed-door training. At that moment, they, to a greater or lesser degree, felt uncomfortable.<br>Gradually, unpleasant words began to sound from the crowd.<br>&ldquo;All of you, quiet down!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a furious shout was heard. It was Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>Once Chu Xuanzhengfa spoke, the crowd that had burst into an uproar earlier immediately quieted down.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s going on? Could it be that you didn&rsquo;t enter the depths of the Bloodline Altar?&rdquo; Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu had both arrived beside Chu Feng to question him with deep concern.<br>&ldquo;I entered it,&rdquo; Chu Feng answered.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing that answer, Chu Huanyu and Chu Haoyan didn&rsquo;t know how to respond.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, did you decide to comprehend your bloodline&rsquo;s power and renounce comprehending martial comprehension?&rdquo; Another voice sounded from behind Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu. It was Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I indeed chose to comprehend my bloodline&rsquo;s power,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied honestly.<br>&ldquo;Foolish child, you can only enter the Bloodline Altar once in your life. How could you take on such risks?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa felt very hopeless after hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s answer. At the same time, he felt pity for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Lord Vice Hall Master, what do you mean by bloodline&rsquo;s power and martial comprehension?&rdquo; Chu Huanyu asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;Upon entering the Bloodline Altar, those with weak talent can only choose to gain enlightenment of martial comprehension. As for those with strong talent, they will be able to comprehend their bloodline&rsquo;s power on top of that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The martial comprehension within the Bloodline Altar is very strong. If one is to gain comprehension from it, one&rsquo;s cultivation will definitely advance by leaps and bounds. With Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent, he would definitely have been able to gain enormously should he have chosen martial comprehension.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for bloodline power, although comprehending it will increase one&rsquo;s control over one&rsquo;s bloodline, it&rsquo;s extremely difficult to comprehend,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa explained.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; at that moment, Chu Huanyu, Chu Haoyan and everyone else present all came to understand why Chu Feng had failed to even activate a single Bloodline Cultivation Formation. It turned out that it wasn&rsquo;t because his talent was insufficient. Rather, it was because&hellip; he had made the wrong choice.<br>Actually, Chu Xuanzhengfa had decided to explain this matter publicly so that Chu Feng could have a way out of the situation.<br>He wanted to let everyone know that it wasn&rsquo;t that Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent was insufficient. Rather, it was because he had made the wrong decision.<br>Although making the wrong choice was Chu Feng&rsquo;s own fault, it was better than having the crowd suspect that Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent was insufficient.<br></p></div>
