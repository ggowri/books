        <h1>Chapter 1825</h1>
        <div> - Miraculous Inheritance Pond<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;What utter bastards. They actually tried to assassinate the princess. I will go and report this to Lord Clan Chief right away,&rdquo; After reaching safety, that Peace Faction&rsquo;s Martial Emperor spoke angrily.<br>&ldquo;Report? What use is there for you to go and report this now? You have absolutely no proof. How would they possibly trust you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, if you are to report this now, Yaojiao Ba will know that his son and his subordinates had been met with an ill fate. He will definitely propose coming in to save them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For the sake of the greater good, the elders will definitely agree to let him come in here to save them. At that time, you reporting to them will be equivalent to saving Yaojiao Xueran and the others,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What do we do then? Are we to suffer this without being able to do anything?&rdquo; That Martial Emperor was very unwilling to let the matter go.<br>&ldquo;Suffer? Heh, that&rsquo;s not necessarily the case. After they die, we can say whatever we want. After all, they will have no way to refute us,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Chu Feng, you are truly clever,&rdquo; Yaojiao Tingyu admired Chu Feng&rsquo;s way of thinking.<br>At this moment, the Peace Faction&rsquo;s Martial Emperor&rsquo;s eyes also shone. The gaze with which he looked to Chu Feng had become very different.<br>Although he did not have an enormous change in his behavior, there was a turbulent storm in his heart.<br>Not only did Chu Feng discover that Yaojiao Xueran and the others had wanted to harm them, he had also thought of a countermeasure right away. Furthermore, he had managed to successfully entrap Yaojiao Xueran and the others and obtain an impossible victory.<br>No matter what, there had been a rank two Martial Emperor among their opponents. If they were to truly fight, they would have been no match for him.<br>However, at this moment, that rank two Martial Emperor could only stay beside Yaojiao Xueran to protect him while struggling against the Underworld Fire Bugs himself and wait for death amidst pain and suffering.<br>Furthermore, even now, Chu Feng did not try to go out and report Yaojiao Xueran&rsquo;s wicked conduct out of impulse. Instead, he had considered all aspects. The things that he had done in such a short period of time could simply be said to be planned and done perfectly.<br>If Chu Feng was an old monster that had lived for ten thousand years, it would be understandable for his planning to have reached this degree. However, Chu Feng was a member of the younger generation that was not even thirty years old. He was someone that had lived for several thousand years less than him.<br>When comparing himself to Chu Feng, that Peace Faction&rsquo;s Martial Emperor felt that he had lived the past thousand years of his life in vain.<br>&lsquo;That human brat&rsquo;s methods are truly fearful. Fortunately, he is a friend and not a foe. Else&hellip; I truly do not dare to imagine,&rsquo; Thinking of this, that Peace Faction&rsquo;s Martial Emperor sucked in a mouthful of cold air. Fear actually emerged in his eyes as he looked to this person from the younger generation with a cultivation much weaker than his own.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, in that case, where should we go now?&rdquo; Yaojiao Tingyu asked. She had decided to listen to Chu Feng and have him determine what they should do. Only by doing this would she feel safe.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do what we came here for. Go to the Inheritance Pond,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Yaojiao Tingyu revealed an expression of joy. After what had happened earlier, she was more confident in Chu Feng. She felt that her decision to rely on Chu Feng would have a high chance of success in obtaining the Lord Dragon King&rsquo;s inheritance.<br>As the path toward the Inheritance Pond was a safe path, Chu Feng was unable to continue to see any more mechanisms left behind by the Black Dragon King.<br>While the path was very clear and safe, even with the speed at which Chu Feng and the others were walking, they were still unable to reach the Inheritance Pond after walking for two entire hours. From that, one could imagine how enormous this Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb was.<br>&ldquo;We should be arriving soon, no?&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll be arriving soon. However, it&rsquo;s still some distance away. How did you know?&rdquo; Yaojiao Tingyu asked curiously. She saw that Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t seem to have said those words through mere guesses. Rather, it seemed that he was certain when he said them.<br>However, the walls of this place were capable of blocking spirit power. The observation methods of world spiritists would be extremely limited in this place. Regardless of how heaven-defying Chu Feng&rsquo;s observation method might be, he should not be able to see the Inheritance Pond at this distance.<br>&ldquo;I am faintly able to sense an aura that resembles you all. Merely, that aura is simply too powerful. It is much more powerful than your elders, and is simply incomparable. I think that aura should be emitted by the Inheritance Pond,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Why is it that we can&rsquo;t sense that?&rdquo; Both Yaojiao Tingyu and the Peace Faction&rsquo;s Martial Emperor were shocked. Even though they were King Monstrous Dragon Beasts, they were unable to sense it. Yet, Chu Feng was able to sense it.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled lightly. He did not explain to them how he had sensed it. After all, something like this could not be explained. Perhaps this was the difference between their talents.<br>It would be unsuitable for Chu Feng to boast of his own talent before them because Chu Feng felt that he should maintain his modesty.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are truly mystical. That said, I have a question I have wished to ask you the entire time,&rdquo; Yaojiao Tingyu asked.<br>&ldquo;Ask away,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Earlier, when you pinched apart those bugs, why were you fine? Yet, when Yaojiao Liuyi did that, he was burned?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yaojiao Liuyi, is he that fool that died after pinching those bugs?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That was him,&rdquo; Yaojiao Tingyu nodded.<br>&ldquo;The reason is simple; the ones I pinched apart were fake, whereas the ones he pinched apart were real,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Fake?&rdquo; Both Yaojiao Tingyu and that Martial Emperor were startled.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a world spiritist&rsquo;s cheap trick. If you all had observed them carefully, you would have been able to tell them apart. Merely, at that time, the situation was so intense that no one thought that I would make fake bugs,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he spread his hands apart, and two palmfulls of Underworld Fire Bugs appeared in his hands.<br>Seeing those Underworld Fire Bugs, Yaojiao Tingyu and that Martial Emperor subconsciously stepped back. Having seen the Underworld Fire Bugs already, they were extremely afraid of them.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared, they&rsquo;re fake,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled. Then, with a clench of his hands, he crushed the Underworld Fire Bugs in his hands.<br>After the Underworld Fire Bugs were crushed, they turned into liquid flames. However, when the liquid flames landed on Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands, Chu Feng was not damaged in the slightest. Furthermore, not long afterward, those liquid flames turned into golden light and disappeared.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re actually fake.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, both Yaojiao Tingyu and that Martial Emperor were blushing with shame. Even though they had carefully observed Chu Feng&rsquo;s Underworld Fire Bugs, they had been unable to discover that they were fake. Those fake Underworld Fire Bugs practically looked exactly the same as the real Underworld Fire Bugs.<br>Although they were monstrous beasts, they were, after all, the descendants of the Black Dragon King. Thus, they actually all possessed spirit power. On top of that, as they were cultivators, they possessed keen observation. Therefore, their perceptions were not weak at all. Yet, the Underworld Fire Bugs Chu Feng had formed through world spirit power had truly been something that they were unable to determine to be fake in a short period of time.<br>&ldquo;Seems like we&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Right at this moment, Chu Feng and the others stopped. Chu Feng was able to sense that the enormous Monstrous King Dragon Beast&rsquo;s Bloodline&rsquo;s aura was much more powerful.<br>Finally, Chu Feng and the others entered a spacious location. This place was extremely vast, and appeared like a world by itself.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze was completely attracted by a lake before him.<br>That lake was no ordinary lake. It was so deep that the bottom could not be seen. Furthermore, the water was muddled in color, and a layer of special mist lingered over the water. The aura that Chu Feng felt was being emitted from this place. Likely, this was that Inheritance Pond. Merely, how could this possibly be considered to be a pond? It was simply a lake.<br>&lsquo;Strange, why is the aura that I felt moving about in the lake?&rsquo; Chu Feng felt that something was amiss. Thus, he used his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to observe the lake.<br>&lsquo;What miraculousness,&rsquo; Upon observing the lake with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes shone, and he revealed an expression of shock.<br>With his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to clearly see that there was an enormous shadow at the depths of this Inheritance Pond.<br>That enormous shadow was a Monstrous Dragon. It was close to a thousand meters long. It was extremely frightening. Although it was only a shadow, and not an actual Monstrous Dragon, it was the source of that aura.<br>Yaojiao Tingyu saw that Chu Feng was muttering to himself, and that his expression had changed. Thus, she asked curiously, &ldquo;Chu Feng, did you discover something?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng raised his head, and discovered that not only was Yaojiao Tingyu looking at him with that gaze, even that Martial Emperor was looking at him with the same gaze.<br>Chu Feng pointed to the pond and asked, &ldquo;Could it be that you all are unable to see it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;See what?&rdquo; Yaojiao Tingyu and the Martial Emperor asked in unison.<br>&ldquo;I understand now,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Yaojiao Tingyu and the Martial Emperor became even more confused.<br></p></div>
