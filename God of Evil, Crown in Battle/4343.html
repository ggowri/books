        <h1>Chapter 4342</h1>
        <div>: Bitter Regret<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;This&hellip; It can&rsquo;t be that&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing the changes going on in Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s body, Long Mumu and her mother froze up.<br>The arrogance that Long Mumu had displayed earlier had already vanished without a trace, and instead, she fearfully ran to her mother&rsquo;s side instead.<br>However, even her mother&rsquo;s face had turned pale. She was so horrified that she felt like her legs could cave in at any moment.<br>This was because they had realized that Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist weren&rsquo;t lying.<br>Long Xiaoxiao had indeed obtained the power of the Dragon Vein Source, and the changes that were happening to her at this very moment were concrete proof of that.<br>Chu Feng was deeply worried about Long Xiaoxiao. As soon as he regained control of his body, he rushed to Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s side to examine her condition, but he soon realized that he was helpless before her current condition too.<br>&ldquo;Master, please come and take a look.&rdquo;<br>Left with no choice, Chu Feng could only plead with his master.<br>However, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist remained unmoved. Instead, he shot a meaningful glance at the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Understanding the intention behind that gaze, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief used a pleading tone and said, &ldquo;Grandmaster, I beseech you to take a look at Xiaoxiao and see what&rsquo;s wrong with her!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip; Lord Clan Chief, your face sure changes faster than the weather! Weren&rsquo;t you unconcerned about your daughter&rsquo;s plight just a moment ago? Why are you so worried about her now?&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist remarked sarcastically.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, I was blind to have wronged you. I&rsquo;ll make sure to apologize and compensate you properly for my disrespect, so I ask Grandmaster to not hold it against me. Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s life is more important than anything else here. I beseech you, Grandmaster, save her!&rdquo;<br>The words of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief were already shocking enough, but what he did right afterward made everyone even more shocked.<br>With a loud &lsquo;putong&rsquo;, he kneeled to the floor and kowtowed deeply to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist!<br>This gesture shocked every single person from the Dragon Clan.<br>This was their Clan Chief here, their lofty and powerful Clan Chief!<br>For so many years, even before the Holy Light Clan, their Clan Chief had never kneeled to anyone before.<br>Yet, he was on his knees right now, right before their eyes.<br>At this moment, there was no one who was as shocked as Long Mumu and her mother.<br>They knew very well why the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was kneeling at this moment. Without a doubt, it was for Long Xiaoxiao.<br>If the Clan Chief was willing to kneel down and apologize for the sake of Long Xiaoxiao, they couldn&rsquo;t begin to fathom just how much Long Xiaoxiao meant to the Dragon Clan now.<br>This made the mother-daughter pair feeling extremely terrified on the inside. With a loud &lsquo;putong&rsquo;, they fell to the floor on their bottoms.<br>There was no way they could stay calm in the face of such a situation. Their grudge with Long Xiaoxiao had already reached an irreconcilable stage, after all.<br>As the saying went, there was only enough space for a single tiger on a mountain. In the Dragon Clan, there could only be Long Xiaoxiao and her mother, or Long Mumu and her mother.<br>So the current turn of events was extremely disadvantageous to the two of them.<br>&ldquo;Alright, Lord Clan Chief. This old man is not an unreasonable person. You should hurry up and get back on your feet.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had fallen to his knees, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist finally began walking over to Long Xiaoxiao to diagnose her condition.<br>A moment later, he said, &ldquo;I have good news and bad news. Lord Clan Chief, which one do you want to hear first?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, tell me the good news first,&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;The good news is that the Dragon Vein Source has started to fuse with Princess Xiaoxiao. If everything goes well, her bloodline ability will undergo a complete enhancement. Just the dragon horns on her head should be enough to show that her body is changing.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not exaggerating when I say this, but if Princess Xiaoxiao is able to mature and fully grasp her power, the top seat of the Holy Light Galaxy might just change hands,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>Those simple words he said were more than enough for the Clan Chief and the Supreme Elders of the Dragon Clan to go frenzied with joy.<br>Wasn&rsquo;t surpassing the Holy Light Clan the goal of their Dragon Clan all this while?<br>It was just that this goal was viewed to be an act of blasphemy, such that they dared not talk about it aloud even while they were within the Dragon Clan. At the very most, they only dared to think about it in their hearts.<br>However, a ray of hope had finally appeared before them, and it was a very brilliant ray of hope. In fact, it would most definitely happen as long as no accidents occurred.<br>How could they possibly not be delighted to hear this news?<br>&ldquo;The heavens are really shining upon our Dragon Clan! They truly are!&rdquo;<br>The Supreme Elders of the Dragon Clan clenched their fists tightly as they howled in agitation.<br>It felt like they had been on a whirlwind of emotions over the last few days. They had pinned their hopes on the opening of the Dragon Vein Source, only to be disappointed when it collapsed right before their eyes. But shortly afterward, another spark of hope flickered before them before blazing into brilliant flames.<br>It was almost as if they had been taken on a ride.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still too early to be celebrating,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist interjected.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, what&rsquo;s the bad news then?&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked anxiously.<br>He knew that the bad news was bound to have something to do with the Dragon Vein Source too.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s talent is not too bad, making her a good fit for the Dragon Vein Source. While the process will be painful, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before she manages to fully assimilate with the power.<br>&ldquo;However, during a crucial moment of her breakthrough, she was insulted and beaten cruelly, causing her to receive traumas on her body and in her heart. At this rate, the fusion could very well end in failure,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;The fusion could end in failure?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the delight on the faces of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Supreme Elders vanished, replaced with fluster instead.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, you must help Xiaoxiao! As long as she is able to fuse smoothly with the energy of the Dragon Vein Source, we&rsquo;ll do anything to satisfy you!&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief grabbed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s arm in agitation as he spoke.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, I&rsquo;m afraid that I can&rsquo;t help you with this matter. I already informed you of everything clearly right from the start, but you refused to believe me. It should have been a joyous occasion, but it ended up like that instead. It was not me, but your own clan members who did it.&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s words caused the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others to lose the glow on their faces. They lowered their heads in shame at their earlier inaction.<br>If Long Xiaoxiao were to really fail to fuse with the Dragon Vein Source due to their moment of callousness, they would become the sinners of the Dragon Clan. They would be condemned for generations to come, and they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to face their ancestors even after their deaths.<br>Haaaa!<br>But at this moment, Long Xiaoxiao struggled to her feet.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, don&rsquo;t stand up! You need to rest at a moment like this!&rdquo;<br>The Supreme Elders of the Dragon Clan quickly persuaded her.<br>However, Long Xiaoxiao didn&rsquo;t pay them any heed at all. Instead, she turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Little benefactor, take me away. I want to leave this place.&rdquo;<br>Her words were very frail, but what that really gripped at the hearts of those present was that despite her distorted bloodstained face, one could still see tears dripping down her cheeks.<br>The Dragon Clan was no longer worthy of having Long Xiaoxiao anymore.<br>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t turn her down. He pulled her up and prepared to leave with her.<br></p></div>
