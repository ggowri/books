        <h1>Chapter 4814</h1>
        <div>: Father&rsquo;s Means<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;With my master&rsquo;s means, he could have easily groomed you to become a top-notch expert if he wanted to. You didn&rsquo;t have to suffer so much. Even with my lacking talents, I was still able to reach my current level thanks to his guidance, let alone you.&rdquo;<br>Zi Ling said these words through voice transmission.<br>Chu Feng knew that the &lsquo;master&rsquo; Zi Ling spoke of referred not to the sectmaster of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect but his father, Chu Xuanyuan.<br>&ldquo;My father has his own considerations here, and I believe in his judgment,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>He didn&rsquo;t blame his father for neglecting him.<br>He had indeed resented his parents greatly for abandoning him, but ever since he met his father and learned of his plight, all of his resentment dissipated into thin air. All he wanted to from then on was to return justice to his father.<br>He began thinking deeper into things. In the first place, it was thanks to his parents that he was even able to come to this world. It was entitled of him to expect them to grant him a life of privilege.<br>He should be thinking of how to give back to his parents instead.<br>Besides, he knew that his father had his own reasons for not keeping him by his side but instead allowing him to grow up by himself.<br>&ldquo;Zi Ling, do you know how strong my father is?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked out of curiosity.<br>In truth, what he knew about his father likely paled in comparison to Zi Ling. After all, he had only met his father for a brief duration whereas Zi Ling had followed him for a period of time.<br>He had always been rather curious about his father.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what cultivation level master is at, but he feels omnipotent to me. I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone who is as powerful as he is. Once, I saw him destroy an entire world,&rdquo; Zi Ling said with a hint of fear in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;An entire world? What world is that? How did he manage to do it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked excitedly.<br>Heaven-splitting and earth-shattering were words that were often used to describe powerful cultivators, but Chu Feng had never seen anyone who was really able to do it. However, it would appear that his father was a cultivator of that caliber.<br>&ldquo;Master and Elder Ape left the confines of the world and traversed in the vast space. From afar, all of the worlds looked no more than small twinkling stars. Back then, master seemed to have discovered something in a lifeless world, so he gathered his martial power and morphed it into a sword.<br>&ldquo;At that very instant, the entire space was lit up by the radiance emanated by that martial power sword.<br>&ldquo;Everything happened so quickly that by the time I finally understood what was going on, that martial power sword had already pierced through the world, slicing it into two,&rdquo; Zi Ling said.<br>&ldquo;That means that my father released a martial power sword that was larger than a world with a casual wave of his hand?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in surprise.<br>&ldquo;That world was quite far away from us. From my point of view, all Isaw was nothing more than a slightly larger planet, and master was standing right beside me. If I really had to make a comparison, that martial power sword was much larger than the world,&rdquo; Zi Ling said.<br>&ldquo;Much larger than the world? My father is actually that powerful?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt goosebumps rising all over his arm.<br>He didn&rsquo;t even have the power to destroy even the smallest of worlds, but his father was able to unleash such power with ease. If multiple of such worlds were stacked in a row, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that his father could actually destroy multiple worlds at once?<br>If those worlds did have living beings on them, they would have died not knowing what happened to them at all.<br>This realization astounded Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What happened afterward? Did my father notice something that led to him destroying the world?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>His gut feeling told him that his father wasn&rsquo;t one to abuse his strength. He definitely had a reason for destroying that world.<br>&ldquo;It turned out that there was a demonic creature residing in the world, devouring the origin energies from the core of the world. It turned the world into a dead planet.<br>&ldquo;That demonic creature was powerful as well. Even though master destroyed the world in a single strike, the demonic creature wasn&rsquo;t destroyed along with it. Instead, it attempted to flee,&rdquo; Zi Ling said.<br>&ldquo;Did it manage to get away?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t. Master was able to subdue it easily. That demonic creature was humongous, but it swiftly shrunk into the size of master&rsquo;s palm as he caught it with his hand. I took a look at it too. Despite its small size, it was still incredibly frightening. I don&rsquo;t even dare to look into its eyes.&rdquo;<br>Zi Ling&rsquo;s voice quivered with fear as she spoke up to this point. It seemed like her encounter with the demonic creature had traumatized her.<br>That was only to be expected. A demonic creature who massacred an entire world&rsquo;s living beings was bound to be a frightening existence. Even Chu Feng would have probably felt fear standing in the presence of such a being.<br>&ldquo;How did he deal with the demonic creature afterward?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;Elder Ape ate it,&rdquo; Zi Ling replied.<br>&ldquo;Ate it? Just like that?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was astounded.<br>&ldquo;Yes. He seemed to enjoy it greatly, saying that its flavor would be further enhanced if he could get some sauce on it,&rdquo; Zi Ling said.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng realized that it wasn&rsquo;t just his father that was unimaginably powerful; Old Ape was a terrifying monster as well. At the very least, it was more powerful than the demonic creature.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu, do you finally understand why I said those words? I asked master about this before, and he said that he believed that you can overcome all odds like he did back then. He also grew without anyone&rsquo;s protection a step at a time back then, so he was well aware of the pros and cons of it.<br>&ldquo;The cons are that the danger you face far surpasses that of others, but in comparison, your experience will temper your mind and willpower, and your cultivation would be much more stable as well. Master often tells me that only those with a stable foundation will be able to reach great heights as a cultivator<br>&ldquo;However, if your mother were to know that master chose to leave you to the lurch despite being able to protect you, she would surely be heartbroken. If you were to treat our children in such a manner in the future, I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;ll be able to forgive you regardless of what justifications you have,&rdquo; Zi Ling said.<br>&ldquo;Our children? Hahaha, shall we make one right now then?&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he snuck his hands toward Zi Ling.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, we can&rsquo;t do that. Someone&hellip; is watching us here,&rdquo; Zi Ling said fearfully.<br></p></div>
