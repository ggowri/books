        <div> - Chu Feng Vs. Infant Soul Sect<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>At that moment, Grandmaster Pocket rushed toward Chu Feng and begged with an anxious expression on his face, &ldquo;Almsgiver Chu Feng, you must shatter that grand formation and stop the Infant Soul Sect. Else, all the people from our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm will die tragically by that grand formation.&rdquo;<br>After hearing those words from Grandmaster Pocket, Chu Feng took a glance at the situation below. However, his expression was cold and detached.<br>Then, he looked to Grandmaster Pocket and said, &ldquo;Grandmaster, even if you want to be merciful, you should still judge who to be merciful to.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For people like them, people who repay kindness with malice, people who are unable to distinguish right from wrong, people who decided to attack you all out of their own self-interest even though you have come to help them, are you really certain that you want to save them still?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Almsgiver Chu Feng, regardless of what they've done, we absolutely cannot sit and watch; remaining indifferent. If they are all to die, it would be equivalent to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm perishing,&rdquo; Grandmaster Pocket continued to urge Chu Feng to help them.<br>However, Chu Feng ignored Grandmaster Pocket&rsquo;s plea. Instead, he turned to Ying Mingchao and the others, &ldquo;While this grand formation is able to heal everyone, its healing speed is relatively slow. Thus, it&rsquo;s best that everyone continues to stay in this grand formation.&rdquo;<br>After hearing what Chu Feng said, Ying Mingchao, Wang Qiang and the others also started to disperse. They sat back in the grand healing formation in an orderly manner.<br>However, one person did not return to the grand healing formation. It was Grandmaster Pocket. He was still standing beside Chu Feng and urging Chu Feng to save those people.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, everyone has their own way of handling things. Today, I, Chu Feng, will not go and kill those foolish traitors.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I will definitely not save them either,&rdquo; Chu Feng said determinedly.<br>Grandmaster Pocket still wanted to urge Chu Feng against it after hearing those words.<br>However, at that time, Chu Feng cast his sharp gaze toward the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster. He said, &ldquo;However, as for that person, I must kill him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword shot forth rapidly as if it were given a command. It was rushing toward the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>No matter how strong the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster might be, he was only the size of a regular human.<br>As for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, it was several hundred meters in length. As it flew toward the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster, it resembled a giant mountain. That sort of pressure was not something that ordinary people could possibly endure.<br>However, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was completely confident. He did not even bother to move. Just like that, he stood there and waited for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword to arrive.<br>Finally, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword arrived before him. The enormous power made the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster&rsquo;s clothes flutter violently. Spatial cracks even appeared in the surrounding space.<br>However, even with that being the case, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster still continued to stand there. Then, he raised his palm and pushed it forth explosively at the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword. &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; He had actually managed to push the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword aside using only the power of his palm, causing it to return to Chu Feng.<br>However, once he attacked with his palm strike, his connection with the Infant Soul Grand Formation was severed. Immediately, the operation of the Infant Soul Grand Formation stopped.<br>Even though the Infant Soul Grand Formation had ceased its operation, the hundreds of millions of lives who were trapped by the Infant Soul Grand Formation were still unable to escape.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are truly a genius. You&rsquo;ve actually managed to reach a breakthrough to the True Immortal realm this quickly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve become a True Immortal, why aren&rsquo;t you entering the Upper Realms? Why did you return? If I were you, I would definitely not have done such a thing,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;Because I cannot disregard the safety of my friends,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You are quite loyal to your friends. However, what makes you think that you can save them? Is it because of that sword?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That sword must be from the inheritance you obtained from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan, no? It actually possesses the strength to surpass an entire level of cultivation. It is truly a heaven-defying secret skill.&rdquo;<br>As the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster spoke, he put the Incomplete Immortal Armament in his hand away.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Did you lose the will to fight after seeing my Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster shook his head. He said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even need my Incomplete Immortal Armament to take care of you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although your appearance has become even uglier, it seems that you&rsquo;ve also become even more confident?&rdquo; Chu Feng mocked.<br>&ldquo;My confidence originates from the power that I currently possess.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for your mere Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, it is simply impossible for it to match me,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered upon hearing those words, &ldquo;Since you said it like that, I will insist on killing you with the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng said those words, his gaze shifted. Then, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword started to rush toward the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster again.<br>&ldquo;Although your Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword possesses heaven-defying battle power, it will not be able to withstand a single blow from this Sectmaster.&rdquo;<br>After the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said those words, he shot forth a palm strike.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>The overwhelming battle power turned into countless palm silhouettes. Those palm silhouettes started to bombard the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;Bang, bang, bang~~~&rdquo;<br>The bombardment from the overwhelming power of the palm strike caused the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword to echo in vibration. It was being pushed back repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng let old a cold snort. Then, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword started to emit even brighter golden light. At that moment, the power of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword greatly increased.<br>Even though the martial power that filled the sky was still bombarding the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword was not moved a single jolt.<br>&ldquo;You want to defeat my Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword with merely an attack of this level? You are truly delusional,&rdquo; Chu Feng mocked.<br>&ldquo;This is merely the beginning,&rdquo; After the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said those words, he unleashed another attack. This time around, he waved his sleeve, and an unending stream of martial power started to pour from his sleeves.<br>After his martial power was sent forth, it started to transform. Soon, a spear was formed.<br>Soon, countless more spears appeared. In an unceasing manner, they began to bombard the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword.<br>Most importantly, those golden spears were not merely an ordinary attack using martial power. Rather, it was a martial skill, a taboo martial skill.<br>Thus, at that moment, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword started to sway left and right again. It appeared as if it would soon be defeated by the bombardment of spears.<br>However, Chu Feng did not panic in the slightest. He continued to have a calm and confident expression on his face.<br>&ldquo;If that is all that you possess, then you really disappoint me. Seems like even after you&rsquo;ve changed beyond recognition, you&rsquo;re still this weak,&rdquo; Chu Feng said indifferently. Then, he suddenly extended his fingers. At that moment, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword started to be directly controlled by him.<br>At that moment, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword seemed like an awakened lion that had lain dormant for a long time. The golden spears that filled the sky and were attacking it nonstop were like a bunch of fleas.<br>WIth a shake of its body, those golden spears that filled the sky all dispersed from it.<br>Then, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword started to sweep across the sky and rush toward the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>Seeing the incoming Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster started to increase the power of his martial skill.<br>At that moment, more and more golden martial power was pouring out from his sleeves. Its power was also growing stronger and stronger.<br>However, even though the golden spears that filled the entire sky continued to bombard the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, they were unable to shake the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword in the slightest.<br>In fact, they were unable to even slow it down.<br>&ldquo;Seems like I have underestimated you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, I refuse to believe that your mere secret skill will be able to contend against me.&rdquo;<br>The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster shouted. Then, his hands layered over one another and he began to form hand seals.<br>After he finished forming his hand seals, surging Immortal level martial power exploded from his body like a volcanic eruption.<br>Even the surrounding space started to violently tremble. In fact, both heaven and earth were trembling. Everyone present was able to clearly feel this intimidating power.<br><br></p></div>
