        <div> - Dumbstruck<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo; At that moment, Chu Feng laughed.<br>Earlier, Chu Feng had listened to Xian Yushi&rsquo;s demand and deliberately pretended to be defeated. On the one hand, it was because he had decided to consider Xian Yushi deliberately making things difficult for him a sort of trial. On the other hand, it was because he was helpless. After all, when beneath eaves, one had no choice but to lower one&rsquo;s head.<br>Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength was at a level where he could move about unhindered in many places, he did not dare to act excessively impudent in a huge monstrous area like the Elf Kingdom.<br>When Chu Feng and the Four Great Imperial Clans were enemies, he had endured a lot of suffering. If he were to become the Elf Kingdom&rsquo;s enemy, it was likely no one would be able to save him. Furthermore, with the strength of the Elf Kingdom, it was likely that all of Chu Feng&rsquo;s friends and relatives would end up suffering.<br>Not to mention others, even Nangong Longjian was greatly inferior to the Elf Kingdom.<br>However, Princess Lingyue was here now. As such, how could Chu Feng possibly continue to listen to that scum? Thus, Chu Feng smiled and said, &ldquo;Chu Feng is willing to seriously spar with Young Master Yushi.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Seriously? What do you mean by that? Are you saying that you were simply not serious in the sparring earlier?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Xian Yushi immediately appeared extremely displeased.<br>As for Chu Feng, he did not bother to answer that foolish question. Instead, he smiled lightly.<br>At that moment, Princess Lingyue smiled. Then, she said, &ldquo;Lil brother Yushi, it would seem that Chu Feng has never placed you in his eyes.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph, what arrogance. Come, I&rsquo;ll make sure to teach you a lesson,&rdquo; Xian Yushi rolled up his sleeves angrily. However, at the same time he was doing that, he continued to secretly threaten Chu Feng, telling Chu Feng to act defeated by him again.<br>While Chu Feng heard his threats, he simply did not place them in his heart. This time around, before all these people, Chu Feng would not allow himself to be defeated by this trash again.<br>&ldquo;&rdquo;It seems lil brother Yushi is extremely confident. However, if it&rsquo;s only a spar, it would be too boring. How about this, I&rsquo;ll add something interesting to this spar.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whoever among you two loses shall drink a cup of Black Lotus Goo. What do you two think?&rdquo; Princess Lingyue said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;This punishment is good. They all say the Black Lotus Goo is edible. Yet, no one has dared to eat it. I also wish to have a look to see whether one will be fine after eating it,&rdquo; At that moment, the other Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves all began to clap their hands in applause.<br>As for Xian Yushi, his complexion turned green. No matter how stupid he might be, he was still able to hear the intentions behind Princess Lingyue&rsquo;s words. At that moment, he realized that the situation was bad. Merely, he was confused. Wasn&rsquo;t it Princess Lingyue who hinted to him to deliberately make things difficult for Chu Feng? Why would she be speaking for Chu Feng now?<br>As for Chu Feng, he was feeling secretly delighted. Of all the punishments, Princess Lingyue decided to use the Black Lotus Goo that Xian Yushi had used to deliberately make things difficult for him. Evidently, she knew about what Xian Yushi had done before, and was planning to give him a taste of his own medicine.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was practically capable of being certain that Princess Lingyue did not hold any malice toward him. Furthermore, she was standing on his side. Although he did not understand why Princess Lingyue would be standing on his side, it remained that it was a good thing.<br>&ldquo;I have no objection to it. Young Master Yushi, what about you?&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>Xian Yushi summoned up his courage and said, &ldquo;When even you&rsquo;re not afraid, why would I be afraid? Heh, ridiculous.&rdquo; At the same time, he was still secretly threatening Chu Feng.<br>Hearing Xian Yushi threatening him nonstop, Chu Feng knew that Xian Yushi was extremely scared right now. He did not wish to be defeated, nor could he allow himself to be defeated. The reason for that was because it would completely ruin his reputation. He would have lost all face before his fellow Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves.<br>Yet, Chu Feng was determined to make him lose all face. This was his punishment for deliberately making things difficult on Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, have no fear. I will handle everything for you,&rdquo; Right at that moment, another voice transmission entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>After hearing that voice transmission, Chu Feng began to feel some sympathy for Xian Yushi. The reason for that was because that voice transmission came from Princess Lingyue. Princess Lingyue actually gave permission for Chu Feng to teach Xian Yushi a lesson.<br>&ldquo;Fist and feet have no eyes. If I am to injure Young Master Yushi, I hope that you will forgive me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, we Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves are not that easily bullied. If you do not trust me, you can give it a try,&rdquo; Xian Yushi said fiercely. With how Chu Feng refused to reply to his various voice transmissions and instead continued to provoke him again and again, he already knew that Chu Feng did not plan to yield to him.<br>However, he could not allow himself to be defeated. Thus, his words were filled with threats. He was hinting to Chu Feng that it would be best if he didn&rsquo;t do anything excessive. Else, he would have to bear the consequences.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, please excuse my rudeness,&rdquo; However, even facing Xian Yushi&rsquo;s open threat, Chu Feng&rsquo;s smile remained unchanged.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng moved. His speed was so fast that he arrived before Xian Yushi in a flash.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s speed was truly too fast, so fast that he left the crowd speechless. The other members of the younger generation present were simply incapable of seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s movements. Only Princess Lingyue was able to see them.<br>At the moment she saw Chu Feng&rsquo;s astonishing speed, her expression immediately changed. Her deep eyes shone with seriousness. She thought to herself, &lsquo;Heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. The rumors are true. Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power is really on par with my little sister&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa~~~&rdquo;<br>During the short period of time when Princess Lingyue was surprised, Chu Feng&rsquo;s two hands were moving nonstop, turning into several thousands of hands. Like a torrential rainstorm, they continued to land onto Xian Yushi&rsquo;s body.<br>Faced with Chu Feng&rsquo;s ferocious attack, Xian Yushi was actually powerless to resist, and could only allow himself to get thrashed.<br>At the moment when Chu Feng stopped his attacks, Xian Yushi was sent flying. Xian Yushi ended up ruthlessly smashing into the palace hall&rsquo;s pillar. When he landed on the ground, he was badly battered with a bloody nose, a bloody mouth and a swollen face.<br>As for the bystanders, they were all dumbstruck. They had all already anticipated that Xian Yushi would not be a match for Chu Feng. However, they did not expect for Xian Yushi to be defeated this quickly. It was only a split second, and Xian Yushi was already left in such a state.<br>However, no matter what, Chu Feng&rsquo;s current cultivation was the same as Xian Yushi&rsquo;s. They were both peak Half Martial Emperors.<br>A heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. Chu Feng actually possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.<br>Thinking of that, the gazes with which the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; younger generation looked to Chu Feng all changed.<br>Earlier, they were somewhat skeptical of Chu Feng. However, their suspicions were now all gone. Instead, they now had a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng.<br>Xian Miaomiao, their Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; legend, was only that exceptional special because she possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.<br>And now, an existence the same as Xian Miaomiao had appeared. Thus, how could they not hold him in importance?<br>&ldquo;Oh my, I am truly sorry. I didn&rsquo;t expect for Young Master Yushi&rsquo;s body to be this weak. My attacks were too heavy. I hope that you will forgive me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said innocently. However, his each and every word was said sarcastically and filled with mockery.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll fucking kill you,&rdquo; Being beaten to such a state before this many people, Xian Yushi was extremely enraged. He took out an Incomplete Imperial Armament and charged toward Chu Feng with a murderous appearance. He was not pretending. He was really planning to kill Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before he could even approach Chu Feng, a stream of energy stopped him and knocked him back in midair.<br>It was Princess Lingyue.<br>&ldquo;To be defeated is to be defeated. To lose in terms of strength is not something important. However, one must not lose one&rsquo;s moral character in the process too. If you are to do that, others will think that our Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves are unable to face defeat with grace,&rdquo; Princess Lingyue said.<br>With Princess Lingyue speaking out against it, no matter how wronged and angry Xian Yushi felt, he still had to endure it.<br>Not only did he have to resist his anger, he even had to present a respectful expression as he said to Princess Lingyue, &ldquo;I was wrong. Big sis Lingyue, thank you for your reminder.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. To make mistakes is fine as long as one is able to recognize them,&rdquo; Princess Lingyue smiled lightly. Then, she said, &ldquo;Men, go and get a bowl of Black Lotus Goo for Young Master Yushi.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, not to mention Xian Yushi, the other Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves were also startled. They did not expect that Princess Lingyue would take what she had said before seriously.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that. I just happen to have a bowl of Black Lotus Goo here,&rdquo; Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly spoke.<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; The crowd were startled again upon hearing those words. The Black Lotus Goo was a speciality of the Elf Kingdom. As such, how could Chu Feng possess it?<br>In fact, not to mention the others, even Xian Yushi had an expression of shock on his face. He did not believe that Chu Feng would possess Black Lotus Goo.<br>However, before the puzzled eyes of the crowd, Chu Feng suddenly extended his hand and grabbed. The bowl in the palace hall that had originally contained the Black Lotus Goo that  Xian Yushi had given Chu Feng reached his hand.<br>Then, he opened his mouth and, &lsquo;burr,&rsquo; vomited out a lump of black substance into the bowl.<br>At that moment, the crowd present were all speechless and dumbstruck.<br>[1.Xima: America&rsquo;s Got Talent, I introduce you to Chu Feng, the amazing magician.]<br></p></div>
