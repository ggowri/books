        <div> - Four Good-for-nothings<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not talk about these things for now. It&rsquo;s better to hurry and find another world spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Else, you all will not be able to enter that Endless Abyss,&rdquo; said the yellow-haired world spiritist, the one who had been first to verbally attack Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Where are we supposed to find a world spiritist at a time like this?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Four grandmasters, do you all have no other method?&rdquo;<br>The leaders of the other four powers began to frown after hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a great amount of world spiritists present. Not all of them are capable of entering the Endless Abyss.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Go and ask one of them for help. We don&rsquo;t care what method you use to request their help. Regardless, we&rsquo;re not going to continue to cooperate with this Liangqiu. He&rsquo;s too weak. If we continue to cooperate with him, we&rsquo;ll definitely not be able to breach the spirit formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we fail with the final chance, it&rsquo;ll not only ruin our reputation, it will also waste all the investment you all have put forth.&rdquo;<br>After the yellow-haired world spiritist finished saying those words, the other three world spiritists also nodded in agreement.<br>&ldquo;Long Daozhi, you go and find someone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right. It&rsquo;s the world spiritist that you found that&rsquo;s useless. Thus, you should take responsibility for this matter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Quickly, go and find a powerful world spiritist. If you bring back more trash and ruin our final chance, we will not be finished with you.&rdquo;<br>The leaders of the four other powers once again turned to attack Long Daozhi.<br>It was obvious that they wanted to enter the Endless Abyss. Else, they would not have gone as far as to exhaust their lifespans and bloodline power to activate the keys.<br>However, after four successive failures and having only a single opportunity left, they all felt that their chances of entering the Endless Abyss had grown extremely small.<br>If they wanted to request assistance from the other world spiritists present, they would naturally be able to do so.<br>However, all the competent world spiritists had already followed the respective powers that had invited them there, and had entered the Endless Abyss with the leaders of those powers.<br>Those that remained were all failures. Even if they were to request help from those people, what could it possibly accomplish?<br>Although they were very unwilling to accept it, they still prepared themselves to be unable to enter the Endless Abyss with how things stood.<br>However, since they&rsquo;d paid such an enormous price for this chance, it was inevitable that they&rsquo;d feel extremely dejected.<br>Adding on the fact that they'd looked down on Long Daozhi from the very start, they placed all the blame on him.<br>Furthermore, they were different from the four world spiritists.<br>The four world spiritists had pushed the blame to Grandmaster Liangqiu because they wanted to make him a scapegoat for their failure.<br>As for them, they did not deliberately seek out Long Daozhi as a scapegoat. Instead, they believed from the bottom of their hearts that the failure was due to Long Daozhi&rsquo;s incompetence, that Long Daozhi was dragging them down.<br>&ldquo;You all should stop going too far.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ignoring exactly which of the five world spiritists are stronger than the others, since they were acting together, it means that success and failure should be a joint responsibility.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What makes you think that the reason for the failure is fully Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s fault?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, what makes you think that the failure is my fault?&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi revealed a displeased look.<br>Even though he was not thoroughly angry, he still found it rather unbearable to be criticized without any basis.<br>He was restraining himself because he did not wish to start a fight before the Dragon Clan.<br>It was also because he wanted to seize the final chance.<br>If they ended up wasting this final chance, then Long Daozhi would definitely not let those people get away.<br>Even though they were of the same bloodline, he must still make them pay for their behavior.<br>After Long Daozhi said those words, the leaders of the four other powers were all surprised.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that they were afraid of Long Daozhi. It was just that Long Daozhi had been extremely humble the entire time, and it was their first time seeing him be daring enough to raise his voice at them. Because of that, they were extremely surprised.<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re unable to take defeat with grace, and are unwilling to admit how weak they are.&rdquo;<br>Everyone became surprised upon hearing the voice.<br>The voice had come from far away.<br>But, the people from the five powers were clearly all gathered together.<br>However, compared to the others, Long Daozhi and Grandmaster Liangqiu revealed ecstatic looks upon hearing the voice.<br>They had managed to determine whose voice it was.<br>As they looked towards the direction of the voice, they became endlessly emotional. Especially Long Daozhi, who immediately soared into the sky and arrived before the person who had spoken earlier.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu soon followed him.<br>The reason for their behavior was because the person who had arrived was none other than Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re alive, you&rsquo;re actually alive.&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulders. He was so emotional that his hands were trembling, and the rims of his eyes were slightly wet.<br>He had thought that Chu Feng had surely died. He had been blaming himself the entire time, and felt deep guilt at Chu Feng&rsquo;s death.<br>Now that Chu Feng had appeared alive and well, he not only felt immense joy, but his repressed emotions were finally released as well.<br>&ldquo;Two seniors, this is a long story. I will give you the details of what happened later.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, we should enter the Endless Abyss first,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he looked to the spirit formation entrance.<br>&ldquo;Right, right, right,&rdquo; Long Daozhi nodded repeatedly.<br>After all, they were indeed at a juncture of life and death at the moment.<br>They no longer had any other method. However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s arrival had brought him hope.<br>After all, Long Daozhi knew very well how capable Chu Feng was. He knew that he was most definitely not someone that ordinary world spiritists could compare to.<br>Thus, as they spoke, Long Daozhi brought Chu Feng over to the others.<br>Long Daozhi had an extremely wide smile on his face.<br>Seeing Long Daozhi looking like that, the four other leaders grew even more furious.<br>They&rsquo;d all heard the exchange between Chu Feng and Long Daozhi. Thus, they knew that Long Daozhi was planning to have Chu Feng help them.<br>But, they were all able to tell that Chu Feng was very young, possibly a person of the younger generation.<br>Thus, they felt that even if Chu Feng was a world spiritist, he would be an extremely weak one.<br>However, Long Daozhi had actually become so happy because of his arrival. It was only natural that they&rsquo;d be angered.<br>&ldquo;Long Daozhi, have you gone mad? You want that brat to breach the spirit formation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you deliberately trying to have us fail to enter the Endless Abyss?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Beyond redemption. You are truly beyond redemption.&rdquo;<br>The four leaders all spoke out against it. Their words were filled with anger. Some among them even unleashed their oppressive mights.<br>However, Long Daozhi showed no signs of anger. He instead smiled coldly.<br>&ldquo;Brat you say?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you all know who he is?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only is he the strongest world spiritist in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, but he is also the most talented world spiritist in the entire Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is your honor to be able to receive his help today,&rdquo; Long Daozhi said with a stern voice.<br>At that moment, even Long Daozhi&rsquo;s voice was filled with confidence.<br>&ldquo;What? The most talented world spiritist in the entire Holy Light Galaxy?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What kind of nonsense are you spouting?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s that talented, how come I&rsquo;ve never met him before?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As expected of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s weakest starfield. You are truly capable of producing talented people. Every single one of you are incomparably weak, and can only boast to satisfy your egos.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What utter ridiculousness.&rdquo;<br>The four world spiritists began to mock and ridicule him.<br>&ldquo;City Master Long, there&rsquo;s no need to bother arguing with them,&rdquo; Chu Feng had arrived before the entrance.<br>&ldquo;Brat, so you&rsquo;re really planning to breach that spirit formation. What outrageous nerve you have.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, we will not cooperate with a brat like you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A brat like you isn't qualified to join hands with us.&rdquo;<br>The four world spiritists mocked Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled disapprovingly. Then, he said, &ldquo;Since when did i say that I&rsquo;d cooperate with you four good-for-nothings?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
