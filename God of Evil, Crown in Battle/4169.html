        <h1>Chapter 4168</h1>
        <div> - Somewhat Fishy<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they saw Chu Feng and Long Daozhi, Grandmaster Liangqiu and the people from Ancestral Martial Dragon City immediately hurried over to them.<br>They all began to inquire about what had happened in the Endless Abyss.<br>As for Long Daozhi, he told Grandmaster Liangqiu and the people from Ancestral Martial Dragon City of the news of them managing to obtain a Dragon Vein Source Stone.<br>Upon learning this news, the people from Ancestral Martial Dragon City were all overjoyed.<br>Some were so emotional that they began to shed tears. Even snot was overflowing from their faces.<br>There were even people that ended up fainting.<br>From this, one could tell what sort of honor it was for them to be able to return to the Dragon Clan.<br>&ldquo;You all must&rsquo;ve gone mad from imagining about returning to the Dragon Clan too much.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You all should have a look at yourselves in a puddle of piss. People like you actually believe you&rsquo;ll be able to obtain a Dragon Vein Source Stone?&rdquo;<br>Soon, voices of mockery began to be heard.<br>Those were people from the other powers.<br>They were standing beside Long Daozhi and the others. Thus, they had heard the things Long Daozhi had said.<br>However, they did not think that Long Daozhi would be able to obtain a Dragon Vein Source Stone. That was why they began to make cutting remarks and began ridiculing them.<br>Long Daozhi and the people from Ancestral Martial Dragon City did not bother with those people&rsquo;s mockery and ridicule.<br>After all, Long Daozhi knew very well that Lord Tonghe would soon make the announcement that his Ancestral Martial Dragon City would be returning to the Dragon Clan.<br>Facts spoke louder than words. At that time, the people ridiculing them would learn of the truth.<br>That truth would be a ruthless slap to their faces.<br>&ldquo;Senior Long, I wonder, am I overthinking things?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I feel that things seem fishy,&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly used voice transmission to speak to Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Oh? What&rsquo;s fishy?&rdquo; asked Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;The people from the Dragon Clan are right here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We were totally capable of publicly revealing the Dragon Vein Source Stone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With the people from the Dragon Clan here, no one would dare behave atrociously. No one would dare to rob your Dragon Vein Source Stone either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There was no reason for that Lord Tonghe to personally bring the two of us to his side and make us meet him in private,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, no matter what, we&rsquo;ve obtained the Dragon Vein Source Stone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it normal that we&rsquo;ll receive this sort of deferential treatment?&rdquo; Long Daozhi said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Even if it&rsquo;s deferential treatment, why didn&rsquo;t he invite us into the warship or have us follow him? Why did he instead have us wait here?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you don&rsquo;t understand. That&rsquo;s the Dragon Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not just anyone can ascend onto the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s warships.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I will soon be returning to the Dragon Clan. Perhaps in the future I&rsquo;ll have the chance to get on their warships.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Well then, let&rsquo;s not overthink things anymore,&rdquo; after saying those words, Long Daozhi raised his head to look at the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s warships. Expectation filled his eyes.<br>Seeing Long Daozhi acting this way, Chu Feng found it unsuitable to say anything else.<br>Truth was, even if something did go wrong, Chu Feng would not be able to do anything anyways.<br>Before absolute strength, Chu Feng could sense how small he was.<br>Even if the Dragon Clan really planned to play tricks with them, they would be powerless to change anything, and would have to resign themselves to fate.<br>It was just that Chu Feng still felt that things were somewhat fishy.<br>Suddenly, the surrounding crowd became restless.<br>The people that were looking with their heads raised immediately bowed respectfully.<br>Long Daozhi and the others from Ancestral Martial Dragon City also bowed respectfully.<br>It turned out that someone had walked out from the war chariot.<br>It was Long Tonghe.<br>&ldquo;All of you have truly disappointed this old man.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To our Dragon Clan, the Dragon Vein Source Stones are a most precious cultivation treasure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Dragon Clan is capable of easily obtaining them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why we decided to leave the chance to obtain them to you all was all because we wanted to filter out talented individuals from among you that could return to serve our Dragon Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, you all wasted this opportunity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Look at that Endless Abyss. Is there any spirituality there now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only did you all miss out on the opportunity to return to the Dragon Clan, but you all also ended up wasting away the Dragon Vein Source Stones and other cultivation treasures in the Endless Abyss.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For the sake of presenting you all with this chance, our Dragon Clan has wasted all those precious cultivation resources.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you all know your faults?!&rdquo;<br>Lord Tonghe spoke. He had a very stern look to his face, and his voice was filled with dissatisfaction and anger.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng and the others realized why the Endless Abyss had become so ordinary.<br>From what Lord Tonghe had said, it seemed like the Endless Abyss had a time limit after it was opened.<br>If one could not retrieve all the treasures from the Endless Abyss within the time limit, the treasures would disappear.<br>Once the treasures disappeared, the spirit formation around the Endless Abyss would also disappear. It was no wonder that the Endless Abyss had become so ordinary.<br>After receiving this tongue-lashing from Lord Tonghe, the people below, all those that were abandoned by the Dragon Clan, all revealed looks of shame.<br>They knew very well how difficult it was for them to have received such an opportunity from the Dragon Clan.<br>Yet, they had failed to grasp it.<br>Seeing how angry Lord Tonghe was, it was very possible that they would not receive such an opportunity again.<br>When this thought crossed their minds, they became even more aggrieved.<br>&ldquo;Fortunately, someone lived up to our expectations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although three Dragon Vein Source Stones were wasted, one was found.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Anyhow, our meticulous preparations managed to filter out some talents.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Someone didn&rsquo;t squander the meticulous efforts our Dragon Clan put forth,&rdquo; added Lord Tonghe.<br>His tone changed. A slight amount of gratification was present in his tone.<br>&ldquo;Someone actually managed to retrieve a Dragon Vein Source Stone?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They must be someone powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It must be the Nine Principles Dragon Sect. Only they possess the strength to obtain a Dragon Vein Source Stone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not for certain. But, regardless of who it was, they&rsquo;re definitely extraordinary.&rdquo;<br>A huge commotion sounded from the people below.<br>They all felt that the person who had obtained a Dragon Vein Source Stone must be someone amazing.<br>After all, for many of them, they&rsquo;d failed to even enter the Endless Abyss.<br>As for those that had managed to enter the Endless Abyss, they had all experienced how difficult it was to find the Dragon Vein Source Stones.<br>In fact, many people did not return alive after entering the Endless Abyss.<br>It went without saying that the Endless Abyss was extremely dangerous.<br>For someone to be able to retrieve a Dragon Vein Source Stone in such a dangerous environment, the people felt both admiration and envy towards them.<br>Hearing the praises that came from all over, Long Daozhi became very pleased.<br>He felt that this could very well be the most glorious day of his entire life.<br>After seeing how pleased Long Daozhi looked and hearing the words spoken by Lord Tonghe, the people that had been ridiculing Long Daozhi earlier started to panic.<br>They were afraid. If Long Daozhi was truly the person that had retrieved a Dragon Vein Source Stone, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that his Ancestral Martial Dragon City would no longer be a trash power from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, but rather people of the Dragon Clan?<br>If that were to happen, their earlier ridicules would&rsquo;ve completely offended Long Daozhi and the others from Ancestral Martial Dragon City.<br>Finally, Lord Tonghe spoke, &ldquo;This old man hereby announces that the Nine Principles Dragon Sect will, from today on, return to the Dragon Clan.&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi and the people from Ancestral Martial Dragon City were completely stunned by his words.<br>Why would it be the Nine Principles Dragon Sect?<br>That Dragon Vein Source Stone was clearly personally handed to Lord Tonghe by Long Daozhi.<br></p></div>
