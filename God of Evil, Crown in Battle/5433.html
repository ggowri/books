        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Chu Feng figured that the other party must have cleared the test before him. While there were quite a few people in front of him, he was only delayed for a brief moment. The fact that the other party was able to pick the correct door within such a short period of time meant that she possessed exceptional talent too.</span><br><span>And Chu Feng&rsquo;s instinct was telling him that she was someone he hated.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Jia Lingyi?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the woman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I am Chu Feng.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance and clothes had changed. He was dressed in the same green robe as her. He knew that everyone possessed no cultivation here, which was why he didn&rsquo;t hesitate to confront Jia Lingyi here.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Jia Lingyi laughed. Her eyes slowly turned cold.</span><br><span>That further convinced Chu Feng that she was Jia Lingyi.</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>Many more spirit formation gates appeared behind Chu Feng as more and more people entered the mountain valley. All of the women looked identical to the woman, whereas all of the men looked identical to Chu Feng. Indeed, all of the people who entered the mountain valley were segregated into only two categories&mdash;men and women.</span><br><span>More and more people entered the mountain valley, but Chu Feng had already locked onto the person who was most likely to be Jia Lingyi. It would have been hard to lock onto someone here considering that their cultivation had been sealed, but Chu Feng was still able to discern among the people via their mannerisms and postures.</span><br><span>However, even if he was able to identify Jia Lingyi, he was unable to do anything about her here. Thus, he turned his attention toward the artwork on the cliff face.</span><br><span>These artworks ranged from only thirty centimeters wide to over a thousand meters long. Some of them depicted humans; some of them depicted animals; some of them depicted sceneries. On the surface, these looked like ordinary paintings rather than formations.</span><br><span>In truth, it was normal to fuse a formation into a painting, but it took special means to perform it so impeccably. Even Chu Feng was unable to do it perfectly, and that piqued his curiosity. He wanted to figure out the method to do so.</span><br><span>In comparison, most people were filled with compliments for the paintings. They were true art lovers.</span><br><span>&ldquo;May I know if you are still satisfied with the paintings?&rdquo; an elderly voice echoed.</span><br><span>As all of the men here had identical voices, the elderly voices particularly stood out. The crowd turned their sights over, only to see an old man. A light was glowing around him, isolating him from the effects of the mountain valley.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Painter.&rdquo; The crowd rushed over to the old man&rsquo;s side. Needless to say, this old man was the World Spiritist Painter, the owner of this land.</span><br><span>&ldquo;These paintings are my mediocre works. My more precious works are located behind that door.&rdquo; The World Spiritist Painter pointed toward the door on one of the cliff faces. &ldquo;Do any of you wish to enter the door?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Painter, I wish to enter the door.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Painter, I have admired you for many years. I am your loyal fan. Could you grant me the opportunity to admire your masterpiece?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Painter, I am terminally ill and my days are numbered. I&rsquo;d be able to die with no regrets if you give me the chance to feast my eyes on your best works.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Many people in the crowd expressed their strong desire to look at the artworks.</span><br><span>The World Spiritist Painter smiled at the warm reception and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my honor to have so many people admire my artworks. However, some of the artworks can only be enjoyed by the cultured. Why don&rsquo;t we do this? I&rsquo;ll impart to you some painting tricks for you to </span><span>give it a try, and I&rsquo;ll pick the painting I'm most satisfied with. The owner of that painting will be allowed to enter my private gallery.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The World Spiritist Painter waved his sleeves, and a surge of spirit power enveloped everyone. This was the spirit power granted by the World Spiritist Painter for them to use for their painting. It was a fair competition, given that everyone was given the same amount of spirit power.</span><br><span>Following that, the World Spiritist Painter explained the way of manifesting a formation into a painting. The crux was to construct the formation in the form of a painting, which meant treating the formation itself as an artwork. Only then could a formation manifest impeccably on a canvas.</span><br><span>Such a feat required sharp control over spirit power and artistic talent.</span><br><span>Chu Feng glanced at the surroundings and saw different expressions on identical faces. Some of them were excited to give it a try, whereas the others looked completely lost.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Those who manage to make their way here are anything but ordinary. I&rsquo;m interested to see who amongst you is a dragon amongst men,&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter said.</span><br><span>He opened up a box, which contained many different brushes. With a wave of his sleeves, the brushes flew toward the crowd. Chu Feng picked one of the brushes, but another man also laid his hand on the same brush at the same time.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother, do you want this brush?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a courteous attitude.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I am the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s Jia Chengxiong. Stand down if you know what&rsquo;s better for you,&rdquo; the man said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Jia Chengxiong?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered. With a tug, he pulled the brush out of Jia Chengxiong&rsquo;s hand.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How dare you compete with me?&rdquo; The man hurled his fist at Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Uwa!</span><br><span>Before his fist could land, his body had already been flipped onto the ground. His body soon floated into the sky and drifted toward the exit spirit formation gate.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, I am the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s Jia Chengxiong!&rdquo; the man quickly explained, knowing that it was the World Spiritist Painter who was driving him out.</span><br><span>Yet, the World Spiritist Painter paid him no heed. He looked at the crowd and loudly announced, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t allow any fighting here. Anyone who refuses to listen will suffer the same fate as him.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jia Chengxiong could only glare at Chu Feng and bellow, &ldquo;Damn it! Who are you?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I am your Grandpa Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>Those words drew everyone&rsquo;s eyes to Chu Feng. It was a reveal more impactful than Jia Chengxiong&rsquo;s.</span><br></p></div>
