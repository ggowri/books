        <h1>Chapter 4371</h1>
        <div>: Doomed?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Damn it, I have underestimated that old thing!&rdquo; Chu Feng muttered with a tight frown.<br>From his point of view, the amount of energy he controlled from the main formation was above that of the guest elder, and the guest elder was even diverting a portion of the main formation&rsquo;s power toward the treasure.<br>Typically speaking, the guest elder shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to overpower Chu Feng.<br>Yet, for some reason, the might of his attacks were actually able to suppress Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>This was illogical!<br>This made Chu Feng realize that the guest elder might possess some peculiar means that he didn&rsquo;t know of. It wouldn&rsquo;t be an easy fight.<br>&ldquo;Young brat, looks like you still have some skills. Speak! How did you siphon away power from the main formation? Is it the treasure you are holding?&rdquo;<br>As the guest elder spoke, his gaze fell onto the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk that was in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>On the other hand, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t reply at all. He devoted all of his attention to driving the main formation in order to subdue the guest elder.<br>This was a life-and-death battle. He had to give it his all if he wanted to survive.<br>It was just a pity that the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk wasn&rsquo;t listening to Chu Feng anymore. Even though the latter was holding it tightly in his hands, desperately trying to activate it, for some reason, it simply wasn&rsquo;t moving at all.<br>Under such circumstances, Chu Feng only had himself to rely on.<br>However, he also knew that he couldn&rsquo;t rely on brute strength to defeat the guest elder, so he began to take a closer look at the main formation, hoping to check if he had somehow overlooked something important.<br>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;<br>Soon, Chu Feng found something amiss.<br>As it turned out, the difference between him and the guest elder lay in their world spiritist bloodline. The reason why the guest elder&rsquo;s control over the main formation was still greater was due to him having infused the powers of his world spiritist bloodline power into the main formation.<br>But since the guest elder was able to infuse his bloodline into the formation, Chu Feng should be able to do the same too.<br>So, without any hesitation, he began to channel the power of his world spiritist bloodline into the main formation too.<br>As expected, once his bloodline began to fuse into the formation, his control over the formation grew significantly.<br>From being in a disadvantageous position, he suddenly claimed the upper hand and began to suppress the guest elder.<br>&ldquo;You possess a world spiritist bloodline?&rdquo;<br>The guest elder also noticed that Chu Feng had infused the power of his world spiritist bloodline into the formation as well, but instead of panicking, an excited look crept onto his face.<br>&ldquo;Amazing&hellip; You aren&rsquo;t just any simple world spiritist. Your world spiritist bloodline is far stronger than I have imagined. In my entire lifetime, I have never seen such a powerful world spiritist bloodline!<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder why you were able to siphon power away from the main formation right before me. Young lad, you are really a remarkable person. Hahaha, I think I get it now. It&rsquo;s the will of the heavens, the will of the heavens!&rdquo;<br>The guest elder grew more and more excited as he spoke, and he even began laughing eerily.<br>Following that, his fighting prowess grew exponentially once more, and this time, his strength shot up severalfold in a single shot.<br>The energy of the main formation began crashing down on Chu Feng wave after wave relentlessly, suppressing him thoroughly.<br>Even though Chu Feng had already infused his world spiritist bloodline into the formation, he was still unable to withstand the power released by the guest elder.<br>Uwaaaa!<br>It eventually came to a point where Chu Feng was unable to stand his ground anymore, and he was knocked down by the relentless waves of powers.<br>Following that, the guest elder used the energy of the main formation to bind Chu Feng. If he wanted to, the guest elder could have easily killed Chu Feng with that energy, but he didn&rsquo;t choose to do so.<br>Instead, he first took back the energy that Chu Feng had siphoned from the main formation before he began to set up a formation on the latter.<br>&ldquo;What are you planning to do?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in astonishment.<br>As a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak world spiritist, he could tell with a look that it was an assimilation formation.<br>The guest elder was planning to assimilate him!<br>&ldquo;Why ask an unnecessary question when you can already tell for yourself? I don&rsquo;t care where you come from and who you are, but since your world spiritist bloodline is useful for assimilating this treasure, I&rsquo;ll be taking it then!<br>&ldquo;But before you die, I can let you know where you erred so that you can die with no regrets. Did you think that you oppose me just because you have wrestled over control over the formation? I applaud your sharp mind, but you miscalculated something.<br>&ldquo;Do you want to know why you can&rsquo;t win against me after all of the preparations you made? Simple. It&rsquo;s because of this!&rdquo;<br>As the guest elder spoke, he tore his robe apart and revealed his chest. There, Chu Feng could see an incredibly powerful formation constructed around the guest elder&rsquo;s heart.<br>It was this formation that granted him master control over the main formation, such that the power he could tap into would always surpass that of Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>&ldquo;This is a formation that the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster personally inscribed onto my body. There are only two of these formations. One of them is on me, and the other one is on the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster. We are the only two people here who have master control over the formation.<br>&ldquo;So, even if you were to siphon all of the energy away from the formation, it wouldn&rsquo;t have made a difference at all. That&rsquo;s because I am the true overseer of this formation!&rdquo;<br>The guest elder burst into hearty laughter. As he spoke, he actually opened up the copper cauldron and tossed Chu Feng in it.<br>&ldquo;This really is heaven&rsquo;s will. Those bunch of good-for-nothings might have allowed a rat to scamper in, but their incompetence became the last key I needed to assimilate this treasure.<br>&ldquo;No, why should I waste him on that treasure? I should assimilate this little brat and take his world spiritist bloodline for myself. Taking in such powerful bloodline will be of great use to me. The value of this little brat far surpasses that of the treasure inside the copper cauldron!<br>&ldquo;Sectmaster of the Soaring Flower Gazebo, don&rsquo;t blame this old man for this. It goes without saying that I should use something so valuable for myself instead to fulfill that disciple of yours! Hahahaha!<br>&ldquo;This is the decree of the heavens, and no one will be able to go against it!&rdquo;<br>After throwing Chu Feng into the copper cauldron, the guest elder began laughing hysterically to himself as he got more and more excited.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng felt as if he had been put into a pool of lava. The temperature inside the copper cauldron was extremely high, such that Chu Feng felt as if his skin and his flesh was being melted down, and even his soul was slowly dissipating.<br>In the first place, the copper cauldron was the center of the main formation, and its primary purpose was to assimilate the treasure. Not to mention, Chu Feng even had a formation inscribed on him by the guest elder, which hastened the rate of his assimilation.<br>At this pace, it would only take him an incense&rsquo;s time to be fully assimilated.<br>Doomed.<br>From the moment that Chu Feng was tossed in here, he knew that he was doomed.<br></p></div>
