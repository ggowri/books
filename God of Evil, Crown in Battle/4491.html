        <h1>Chapter 4490</h1>
        <div>: A Match<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The abrupt disappearance of the energy had really caught Chu Feng off guard.<br>But soon, he realized that it was the old man who had retracted his energy from Chu Feng on his own accord. There was a mischievous smile on his face.<br>Chu Feng stared at the old man quietly as he tried to figure out just what the latter was up to.<br>&ldquo;Brat, I&rsquo;ll acknowledge the courage you have in seeking power. It wouldn&rsquo;t look good on me to kill you just like that, so I&rsquo;ll give you a chance. As long as you can defeat my disciple, not only will I allow you to leave safely, I&rsquo;ll even let you take this away with you.&rdquo;<br>The old man pointed to the waterlike pearl, which had practically absorbed all of the natural energies and martial comprehension harnessed within the Whitesky Star River.<br>&ldquo;Master, you must be joking! How can someone of his caliber possibly be a match for me? It&rsquo;s a great insult for me to cross hands with him! Even if I win, it won&rsquo;t look good on me!&rdquo; the young man grumbled unhappily.<br>The eyes that he looked at Chu Feng with were filled with contempt, as if gazing down upon a lesser being.<br>&ldquo;Why are you looking at me in such a manner? Do you feel indignant at my words?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t do anything at all, but the young man had started talking to himself.<br>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t honestly be thinking of fighting with me, are you? You foolish thing, let me wake you up to reality!&rdquo;<br>Boom!<br>The black robe of the young man fluttered as a powerful oppressive might burst forth from him.<br>Upon sensing the oppressive might, Chu Feng felt his heart clenching up a little.<br>Just like Chu Feng, the young man should be a junior as well. Yet, his cultivation had actually reached rank one Martial Exalted level, making him an opponent far beyond Chu Feng&rsquo;s means to deal with.<br>It was no wonder why the old man had the power to massacre the powerful race from the Ancient Era. Just the strength of his disciple was enough to hint at the massive power he possessed.<br>&ldquo;Brat, what realm are you at?&rdquo; the old man asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This lacking junior is only at rank five Utmost Exalted level,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied humbly.<br>&ldquo;Then you won't be a match for my disciple. However, it&rsquo;s not as if a fight is entirely impossible. I&rsquo;ll have my disciple to suppress his cultivation to rank five Utmost Exalted level, but there&rsquo;s a condition to that. You mustn&rsquo;t use any means to raise your cultivation,&rdquo; the old man said.<br>Hearing those words, a hint of hope resurfaced in Chu Feng&rsquo;s despairing eyes.<br>In terms of real strength, Chu Feng was definitely no match for the young man. However, if both of them were to suppress their cultivation to the same level, Chu Feng felt that he still stood a good chance.<br>His fighting prowess had always exceeded that of his peers, so he had never feared any opponent in the same cultivation level as him.<br>Nevertheless, he was still a little worried about this matter.<br>The enemy was simply too strong, and the old man was looking at him with teasing eyes too. It was almost as if Chu Feng was nothing more than entertainment to them, and they were just letting live a moment longer to have some fun.<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t say for sure whether they would hold to the end of their promise. If they were to renege on his words, Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t be able to walk out of this place alive even if he defeated the young man.<br>Other than that, Chu Feng also had another worry too&mdash;would the young man agree to the old man&rsquo;s proposal?<br>After all, the young man did look like an incredibly conceited individual.<br>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;<br>Contrary to Chu Feng&rsquo;s thoughts, the young man actually agreed to it right away.<br>Following that, Chu Feng could feel the young man&rsquo;s cultivation level plummeting rapidly from rank one Martial Exalted level down to rank five Utmost Exalted level.<br>With a wave of his hand, a wooden stick appeared in his grasp. He lifted his wooden stick and pointed it at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that I have taken advantage of you. You can use any weapon you want; I&rsquo;ll use this wooden stick to curb you. If I draw any other weapons, you can consider this match my loss!&rdquo; the young man spoke confidently.<br>Seeing this, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but chuckle to himself lightly. He released his spirit power and manifested it in the form of a wooden stick.<br>&ldquo;You are the one who has suppressed your cultivation to fight with me. If anything, I&rsquo;m the one taking advantage of you. Even though this wooden stick was manifested using spirit power, it won&rsquo;t raise my fighting prowess. Also, if you don&rsquo;t use any martial skills, I won&rsquo;t use mine either,&rdquo; Chu Feng told the young man.<br>&ldquo;Oh? I didn&rsquo;t think that trash like you would actually have some backbone. However, I hope that you won&rsquo;t regret your decision!&rdquo;<br>The young man&rsquo;s silhouette suddenly blurred as he charged toward Chu Feng like a swift phantom. At the same time, he channeled his strength into his wooden stick and swung it toward Chu Feng with devastating might.<br>His refined control over his strength showed his skills as an expert cultivator clearly! Even with a mere wooden stick in hand, he was able to draw great power from it.<br>On the other hand, despite being confronted face-on by the enemy, Chu Feng had no intention to back down. He held the wooden stick in his hand tightly and swung it forward.<br>His target, however, was not the young man but the stick he had in his hand.<br>Chu Feng was intending to collide with the young man face-on to challenge him to a clash of might!<br>Klang!<br>The two wooden sticks struck each other with such great force that a sharp metallic reverberation exploded from the clash. Ripples of shockwave burst into the surroundings and ravaged the area.<br>Under the backlash from the clash, the two of them retreated several steps back.<br>After regaining his balance once more, a hint of astonishment flickered across Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>His fighting prowess had always been above that of his peers. There was rarely anyone who could fight on equal terms with him in the same cultivation level.<br>Yet, in the earlier clash, he was forced to retreat three more steps than the young man.<br>A difference of three steps wasn&rsquo;t entirely indicative of the difference in their strength, but Chu Feng could also feel a numbing sensation in his arm as well. A small crack had also appeared in the wooden stick in his grasp.<br>In contrast, the young man&rsquo;s weapon was still completely intact, and he didn&rsquo;t seem to be fazed by the earlier clash too.<br>&ldquo;This fellow is really powerful!&rdquo;<br>Knowing that he had met his match this time around, Chu Feng dared not to let his guard down.<br>Even with the young man suppressing his cultivation, Chu Feng still wasn&rsquo;t in an advantageous position. It would appear that the young man&rsquo;s fighting prowess was still above that of Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but marvel at how vast the world was. He had finally met someone in the same generation who could push him into a corner once again!<br>However, this realization only made him tremble in excitement. He was far more interested in fighting against a strong opponent than a weak one.<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t the only one who was surprised after the clash. The young man was also looking at Chu Feng in astonishment. The previous contempt in his eyes had vanished without a trace, replaced with intrigue instead.<br>&ldquo;Not too bad! Your cultivation might be weak, but your skills are still up to standard. I didn&rsquo;t think that a place like the Nine Souls Galaxy, which is severely lacking in experts, would have someone of your caliber!<br>&ldquo;Interesting! It has to be at least this much to make an interesting fight, don&rsquo;t you say so? However, I&rsquo;ll be taking the victory for this fight!&rdquo;<br>Speaking up to this point, the young man began charging forth once more with a wooden stick in hand. He wasn&rsquo;t using any martial skill or secret skill, relying solely on basic attacks.<br>But this time around, Chu Feng could sense that the other party was far more aggressive than before.<br>In response to the attack, Chu Feng channeled his martial power into the wooden stick to enhance its resilience before stepping forward to face the young man.<br>This time around, Chu Feng had decided to change his strategy. Instead of going for a head-on clash, he began to maneuver around the area skillfully to curb the young man&rsquo;s offense and retaliate.<br>And after Chu Feng changed his strategy, the confidence of the old man who was certain in his disciple&rsquo;s victory a moment ago began to falter a little.<br>&ldquo;How is that brat this formidable?&rdquo; the old man remarked.<br>He realized that his talented and powerful disciple was gradually falling into a disadvantageous position!<br></p></div>
