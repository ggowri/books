        <h1>Chapter 5333</h1>
        <div>: All of You Deserve to Die<br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s from the Totem Dragon Clan?&rdquo; the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master asked Zhou Dong.<br>&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know either!&rdquo; Zhou Dong shook his head. He didn&rsquo;t know if the white-haired woman was really from the Totem Dragon Clan.<br>The Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master hesitated, but he eventually chose to retract the grayish-black aura he had unleashed to seal off the spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;Please inform the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief that our Bluemoon Sacred Palace is only here for the Ancient Realm. We have no intention of offending the Totem Dragon Clan,&rdquo; the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master said.<br>The teleportation energy around the white-haired woman began to flow once more.<br>&ldquo;Aunt, save Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>The white-haired woman shouted with all her strength, but she didn&rsquo;t receive any answer at all. Moments later, she disappeared into thin air together with the teleportation energy.<br>&ldquo;Father, I had a conflict with that woman, but I didn&rsquo;t know that she was from the Totem Dragon Clan,&rdquo; Zhou Dong hurriedly explained.<br>Knowing how influential the Totem Dragon Clan was, he was afraid that his father would blame him for offending them.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I have already shown ample respect to the Totem Dragon Clan. Besides, we&rsquo;ll leave straight away after settling things here. Even if they wish to come after us, they won&rsquo;t be able to make it in time,&rdquo; the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master replied.<br>&ldquo;Lord Father, that person standing beside Chu Feng is Bai Yunqing. He says that he&rsquo;s the disciple of the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s First Guest Elder, but he&rsquo;s also Chu Feng&rsquo;s lackey. I don&rsquo;t want to let him off the hook so easily,&rdquo; Zhou Dong said.<br>&ldquo;The First Guest Elder isn&rsquo;t a Totem Dragon Clansman. He&rsquo;s nothing to be scared of,&rdquo; the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master said. He turned to Bai Yunqing and sneered, &ldquo;Brat, you dared to offend my son? Kowtow and admit your mistakes. Show enough sincerity, and I&rsquo;ll consider sparing your life on account of your master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I can kowtow and plead for mercy, but you have to spare my big brother,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing replied.<br>&ldquo;Your big brother?&rdquo; The Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master was taken aback.<br>&ldquo;Lord Father, he&rsquo;s referring to Chu Feng. That fool has taken Chu Feng as his big brother,&rdquo; Zhou Dong quickly explained.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng hurt my son. He has to pay with his life,&rdquo; the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master replied.<br>&ldquo;Then your son has no right to make me kneel to him. Kill me if you wish to,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing replied obstinately.<br>&ldquo;You have spunk,&rdquo; the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master sneered. He turned to Zhou Dong and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave this fellow for you to deal with.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Father.&rdquo; Zhou Dong&rsquo;s face beamed in delight.<br>Chu Feng was already on the verge of death, and the white-haired woman had been saved by the Totem Dragon Clan. Bai Yunqing was the only one on whom he could vent his anger. However, he was not in a rush to make a move. He would wait till he recover before slowly torturing Bai Yunqing.<br>&ldquo;Zhou Dong, you said that you would let us off,&rdquo; Qin Shu and Jia Chengying said fearfully.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Are you afraid?&rdquo; Zhou Dong asked with a smile.<br>Qin Shu and Jia Chengying&rsquo;s complexion turned awful. How could they not be afraid? The full army of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace was right before their eyes. Even the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master was here too!<br>&ldquo;Zhou Dong, I didn&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;re the son of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master. Allow me to apologize if I have offended you in any way,&rdquo; Qin Shu said.<br>&ldquo;Zhou Dong&hellip; I mean, Young Palace Master Zhou, we were close allies during our time in the Ancient Realm. In view of that, won&rsquo;t you at least spare my life?&rdquo; Jia Chengying put on an even humbler attitude.<br>Zhou Dong relished in the wondrous feeling of being on top of the world, but he knew that whether to spare those two or not was his father&rsquo;s decision to make. Thus, he turned to the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master and asked, &ldquo;Lord Father.&rdquo;<br>The Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master waved his hands and said, &ldquo;Young friends, you may leave. Your family members are waiting for you outside.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our deepest gratitude, elder.&rdquo;<br>Qin Shu and Jia Chengying rushed out of the spirit formation gate without a moment&rsquo;s delay. Their flustered escape piqued the laughter of the members of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace. Despite the preaching of those so-called righteous sects, they were all fools who were scared of death.<br>&hellip;<br>Outside, Mo Wuxiang was glad to see that Jia Chengying was safe. He quickly enquired about the situation via voice transmission. Upon learning about the happenings in the Ancient Realm, he understood that it wouldn&rsquo;t be safe to stay here and ordered the Pill Dao Immortal Sect to retreat from the area.<br>At the same time, Gongsun Wentian also asked Qin Shu about the situation inside too.<br>&ldquo;Those beasts are indeed after the Ancient Realm.&rdquo; Xia Xingchen gritted her teeth.<br>&ldquo;Lord Gongsun, what should we do?&rdquo; Qin Shu asked.<br>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t get involved in this matter. Let&rsquo;s return to our sect,&rdquo; Gongsun Wentian ordered.<br>With a thrust of his palm, he shattered the barrier that had sealed off the realm, which the army of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect escaped through.<br>The shattering of the barrier enabled the usage of spirit formation gates to leave the realm, which was exactly what the crowd did. They knew better than to remain here, especially after they had seen the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s forces.<br>Inside the Ancient Realm, Yuan Jiang&rsquo;s smile widened to the brim.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost time. I can extract the imprint now,&rdquo; he murmured.<br>Both his eyes and the stone in his hand began radiating immense power. With a tug, the body of the unconscious Chu Feng began twitching all about. It was almost as if what Yuan Jiang was extracting wasn&rsquo;t just the imprint but Chu Feng&rsquo;s life too.<br>Never had Chu Feng been in such a weakened state before.<br>&ldquo;As expected of someone chosen by the Ancestral Idol. It sure is difficult to extract the imprint from you,&rdquo; Yuan Jiang grumbled as he increased his force.<br>That made the twitching Chu Feng fall completely silent. At the same time, his life force was also depleted to its final sliver. He was just a step away from death!<br>His precarious state caused his World Spirit Space to plunge into darkness, and everything started to quake. It looked as if his World Spirit Space was going to collapse.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Chu Feng? Talk to me! You bastard, talk to me! Didn&rsquo;t you say that you&rsquo;ll be all right? What&rsquo;s with this then?&rdquo; Eggy had been calling out to Chu Feng for a while now, but there was no response whatsoever.<br>Her eyes had turned red, and her voice had become hoarse. Her body was quivering ever so slightly. Panic like never before could be seen on her beautiful face.<br>It came to a point where she stopped calling out for Chu Feng, but her eyes continued to flicker. She was making a difficult decision. Eventually, her eyes hardened in determination. She took in a deep breath and closed her eyes. She plucked a black feather from her feather skirt and grasped it in her hand.<br>Mysterious light seeped out from the cracks of her hand. She then opened her hand and carefully placed the black feather on the ground.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you shouldn&rsquo;t blame me for doing this. I can&rsquo;t watch as you lose your life. If someone has to die here, let me be the first one,&rdquo; Eggy said. Her voice was gentler than it had ever been, but it was a pity that Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t hear her.<br>Eggy slowly rose to her feet and took in another deep breath. Black gaseous flames had started to seep out of her body.<br>Woosh!<br>She opened her eyes.<br>Her pupils had turned pitch-black. There was no beauty in her gaze anymore, just endless darkness.<br>Boom!<br>Her hair and her skirt furiously fluttered as black gaseous flames poured out from her body, enveloping the entire World Spirit Space in just a split instant.<br>Boom!<br>Outside the World Spirit Space, a pitch-black crevice appeared above Chu Feng&rsquo;s head.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br>The appearance of the crevice caught everyone&rsquo;s attention. An indescribably dreadful aura that seemed as if it had come straight from hell was seeping out from within, and it struck fear into the depths of their hearts. As the crevice slowly grew larger, the crowd grew more flustered.<br>&ldquo;It looks like a world spirit gate, but there are some differences in it. What&rsquo;s that monster?&rdquo;<br>Even the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master looked unnerved.<br>Zhou Dong hid behind the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master. His body was trembling in fear, not showing the slightest trace of his earlier arrogance. He looked like a frightened little child.<br>Yuan Jiang had also stopped trying to extract the imprint from Chu Feng. He also felt threatened by the crevice, so he retreated to the side of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master too.<br>Boom!<br>Black gaseous flames suddenly erupted out from the crevice with great force, gushing straight into the sky. But what was more terrifying were the two gigantic hands over ten thousand meters long that extended out of the crevice afterward. They grabbed the edges of the crevice and pulled it open.<br>Cracks appeared all over the ground and the sky. It looked as if the end of the world had arrived.<br>&ldquo;What the hell is that?&rdquo;<br>Even the experts of the demonic sect trembled before the frightening existence. They had encountered countless demons over the years, but none of them were as dreadful as this.<br>The enlarging of the crevice caused more black gaseous flames to pour out. It didn&rsquo;t take long for everything in the vicinity to be covered in black gaseous flames. It had become the dominant force in this realm.<br>A woman walked out amidst the black gaseous flames.<br>She was so beautiful that it was hard to imagine that someone could look that way, but not a single person was in the mood to admire her beauty. Even the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master began trembling uncontrollably.<br>They knew that the terrifying aura they felt was coming from this gorgeous woman. Her eyes that emanated black gaseous flames were so imposing that none dared to look straight at them.<br>&ldquo;I-it&rsquo;s her?&rdquo;<br>While everyone was horrified beyond words, Bai Yunqing recognized that woman to be Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit, just that she was much more terrifying than before. He had met many world spiritists before, but none of them had exerted such pressure on him before.<br>The entire world was looking at Eggy, but her eyes fell on Chu Feng instead. She began to tremble when she saw the state he was in, and killing intent started to seep out of her little body. All of a sudden, she turned to Yuan Jiang, who was standing next to the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master, and furiously roared.<br>&ldquo;All of you deserve to die!&rdquo;<br></div>
