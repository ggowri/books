        <div> - Deepsea Pupils<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I also do not understand why he suddenly decided to leave. He came here precisely to challenge you, and knew that you were here in the Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In fact, after he defeated Lingxi, he still called for you to come out to fight him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, all of a sudden, he changed his plans and left with the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen that came with him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, before he left, he left a message.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He stated that he would return to challenge you again in three months&rsquo; time. At that time, if you do not accept his challenge, he will&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa suddenly hesitated.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what will he do if I do not accept his challenge?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;He said that him digging out Lingxi&rsquo;s eyes today is only a warning.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He will return to challenge you again in three months&rsquo; time. At that time, if you do not accept his challenge, he will not only dig out the eyes of all the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, but he will also cripple all of our cultivations,&rdquo; said Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>&ldquo;Very well, I will wait three months for him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After three months, not only will I dig out Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s eyes before Lingxi, but I will also take his life.&rdquo;<br>When Chu Feng said these words, even the surrounding air turned ice-cold.<br>His killing intent caused even the people of the older generation present to feel their blood run cold.<br>They all knew that Chu Feng seriously intended to kill Linghu Hongfei.<br>Disregarding whether or not he could do that, merely his killing intent was sufficient to make them feel uneasy.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that they were afraid that Chu Feng could not kill Linghu Hongfei. Instead, they were afraid that Chu Feng might actually be able to kill Linghu Hongfei.<br>Who was Linghu Hongfei? He was the future of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>If Chu Feng really ended up killing Linghu Hongfei, how could the Linghu Heavenly Clan possibly spare them?<br>They would all end up suffering a calamity.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I know that you&rsquo;re furious right now. We all feel the same way as you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, this matter concerns the safety of our Chu Heavenly Clan. You must consider the greater good,&rdquo; said Chu Hanpeng.<br>&ldquo;What did you say?!&rdquo; Suddenly, Chu Feng looked to Chu Hanpeng.<br>His gaze was overwhelmingly fierce. It seemed like the gaze of a ferocious beast.<br>Seeing that face, Chu Hanpeng trembled with fear and took several steps back.<br>At that moment, all the elders that had wanted to dissuade Chu Feng turned pale with fear, and no longer dared to say anything.<br>&ldquo;I will definitely avenge Lingxi. In three months, it will either be Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s death or my death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those who are not afraid of death can stay here. Those who are afraid of death can leave at once.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he tossed a title plate to Chu Hanpeng.<br>The crowd were all surprised by Chu Feng&rsquo;s sudden action of throwing a title plate at Chu Hanpeng. However, after they saw what that title plate was, Chu Hanpeng, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elders, and even Liangqiu Chengfeng, who stood to the side, revealed an enormous change in their expressions.<br>The reason for that was because written on that title plate in large characters were &lsquo;Ancestral Martial Dragon City.&rsquo;<br>Furthermore, no matter how they looked at the title plate, it did not appear to be a counterfeit.<br>What did Ancestral Martial Dragon City represent? All of them knew very well what it represented.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how did you obtain this title plate?&rdquo; asked Chu Hanpeng.<br>&ldquo;The Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s City Master told me that our clansmen could seek refuge at his place.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng only said those words, and did not bother to explain the details.<br>His mood was extremely bad, and he did not want to explain things in detail.<br>Chu Hanpeng and the others were all overjoyed.<br>To be able to seek refuge in Ancestral Martial Dragon City brought them the hope of survival.<br>If anyone could save them in the Ancestral Martial Starfield after offending the Linghu Heavenly Clan, then perhaps it would only be the Three Cities.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the tightly closed entrance to the palace hall opened. Grandmaster Liangqiu walked out.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, how&rsquo;s Lingxi?&rdquo;<br>Seeing Grandmaster Liangqiu walking out, Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa immediately rushed up to ask him how Chu Lingxi was doing.<br>However, faced with Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s hopeful gazes, Grandmaster Liangqiu revealed an ashamed look.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu heaved a sigh. Then, he said, &ldquo;Her injury is to her soul. Ordinary treatments are simply useless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We must quickly find new eyes for her. Otherwise&hellip; her eyes will never be cured, and she will forever lose her eyesight,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Allow me. Give my eyes to her,&rdquo; a voice was immediately heard after Grandmaster Liangqiu finished his words. It was Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa felt extremely distressed to see his daughter in such a state.<br>To him, as long as he could cure Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s eyes, not to mention giving his eyes to her, even if he needed to give his life in exchange for her eyes, he would be willing to do so.<br>However, Grandmaster Liangqiu shook his head at Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s request. &ldquo;No, that wouldn&rsquo;t do. Ordinary eyes are unable to help her. Her eyes must be replaced with a natural oddity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Natural oddity?&rdquo; The crowd&rsquo;s expressions changed upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Furthermore, they cannot be ordinary natural oddities. Instead, they need to be a pair of natural oddities that formed eyes,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; At that moment, Chu Xuanzhengfa had a dejected look. Even Chu Feng revealed despair in his eyes.<br>Natural oddities were not difficult to find. However, natural oddities that had condensed into eyes were things that Chu Feng had never even heard of before. Where could one find such natural oddities?<br>&ldquo;Senior, do you know where there's such a natural oddity would be in the Ancestral Martial Starfield?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;There just so happens to be one such natural oddity in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is called the Deepsea Pupils. If you could obtain them, Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s eyes would definitely be able to be cured,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Senior, where are the Deepsea Pupils?&rdquo; Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa asked at the same time.<br>&ldquo;Lonesome Upper Realm, Mirror Sea,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;MIrror Sea?!&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa revealed a look of despair.<br>The people present all knew what sort of place the Lonesome Upper Realm&rsquo;s Mirror Sea was.<br>It was one of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s Eccentric&rsquo;s Remnants.<br>It was the place that contained the legendary Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.<br>However, the Mirror Sea was an extremely dangerous place.<br>Not to mention going there, just hearing the name of the Mirror Sea would bring fear upon people.<br>If those Deepsea Pupils were located elsewhere, perhaps the crowd might attempt to seek them out.<br>However, if they were located in the Mirror Sea; it would be practically hopeless.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;<br>At the moment when everyone had given up hope, a voice was heard.<br>It was Chu Feng!!!<br></p></div>
