        <h1>Chapter 2791</h1>
        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s No Match<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Chu Feng noticed that it was not only cyan flames that enveloped Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s body, but silvery light was also being emitted from her body.<br>That silvery light was not only dazzling, but the aura it emitted was also very powerful. That powerful aura was the reason why Chu Feng felt that the situation was bad.<br>Chu Feng had felt this sensation before. It was from Chu Xianshuo&rsquo;s Immortal Technique. The ability that Xia Yun&rsquo;er was using right now was an Immortal Technique.<br>Seeing that the situation was bad, Chu Feng immediately unleashed his Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe. Chu Feng felt that he would likely not be able to block Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s Immortal Technique should he rely on only the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword.<br>After the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe appeared, it did not rush to attack Xia Yun&rsquo;er. Instead, it actually joined the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and protected Chu Feng within it.<br>&ldquo;Immortal Technique: Skyfill Silvery Light!!!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Xia Yun&rsquo;er let out a shout. She clasped her palms together and unleashed her Immortal Technique at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, like the tide, boundless silvery light started to bombard Chu Feng. Soon, the silvery light completely swallowed the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe.<br>&ldquo;Boom, boom, boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Rumbles were sounding nonstop. The silvery light was so dazzling that Chu Feng was unable to open his eyes as they bombarded him from all directions.<br>The force of the bombardment was no small matter. Even though Chu Feng was being protected by both the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe, he was still able to sense intense vibrations.<br>From this, it could be seen that Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s Immortal Technique was extremely powerful. At the very least, it was much more powerful than the Immortal Technique Chu Xianshuo had used back then.<br>That said, regardless of how powerful Immortal Techniques might be, they were still restrained by their cooldown time. After a while, the Immortal Technique Xia Yun&rsquo;er had used stopped its bombardment of Chu Feng and began to dissipate.<br>After the Immortal Technique dissipated, Chu Feng heaved a long sigh of relief.<br>The Immortal Technique Xia Yun&rsquo;er had used was simply too powerful. If its bombardment had continued, Chu Feng would likely not have been able to persist in his defense. After all, using both the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe simultaneously put an enormous burden on Chu Feng.<br>Fortunately, that Immortal Technique ended. Furthermore, as Immortal Techniques could only be used once within a certain period of time, Chu Feng felt that the battle between him and Xia Yun&rsquo;er would end with that.<br>When Xia Yun&rsquo;er saw that Chu Feng was actually unscathed, the anger in her eyes immediately and greatly increased.<br>The next moment, golden light shone from her body.<br>&ldquo;What the hell, again? Didn&rsquo;t they say that Immortal Techniques can only be used once within a certain period of time?&rdquo; Chu Feng was surprised.<br>&ldquo;No, the light this time around is different from that last time around,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, this girl actually possesses other Immortal Techniques?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed. He realized that Xia Yun&rsquo;er was going to continue unleashing Immortal Techniques at him. Furthermore, he faintly felt that the Immortal Technique Xia Yun&rsquo;er was going to unleash next would be stronger than the last one.<br>&ldquo;Immortal Technique: Skyfill Golden Light!!!&rdquo;<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er shouted. Then, she unleashed her attack at Chu Feng again. Apart from turning into golden light, the Immortal Technique Xia Yun&rsquo;er unleashed at this moment was practically the same as the last Immortal Technique. However, the might of this Immortal Technique was indeed stronger than the previous one.<br>Thus, being bombarded by the golden light, Chu Feng&rsquo;s Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe and Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword started to tremble even more violently. Chu Feng was placed under even greater pressure.<br>That being said, the Immortal Technique this time around was still blocked by Chu Feng&rsquo;s Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe.<br>However, after Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s second Immortal Technique dissipated, Chu Feng also vomited out a mouthful of blood, while his aura grew much weaker.<br>Immediately after that, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe disappeared.<br>Evidently, Chu Feng was no longer capable of using them.<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s current reaction, Xia Yun&rsquo;er finally revealed a faint cheerful expression.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xia, it&rsquo;s not like I did it on purpose. There&rsquo;s no need for you and I to end up both suffering because of something minor like this, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Something minor? You dare say that this is something minor? You&rsquo;re truly looking to die!!!&rdquo;<br>As Xia Yun&rsquo;er spoke, she clasped her palms. The next moment, her body actually started to emit both silvery and golden light.<br>&ldquo;Holy crap, this girl actually possesses a third Immortal Technique?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng frowned tightly, and his eyes were wide open.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell that the Immortal Technique Xia Yun&rsquo;er was going to unleash would be stronger than both of the Immortal Techniques she had unleashed earlier.<br>As for Chu Feng, he was no longer capable of using the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe.<br>Thus, Chu Feng had lost the capability to contend against Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Immortal Technique: Gold and Silver Skyfill Slash!!!&rdquo;<br>Following a loud shout from Xia Yun&rsquo;er, the gold and silver slash was shot toward Chu Feng.<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s current Immortal Technique could be said to be the strongest Immortal Technique she had used so far.<br>Faced with such a powerful attack, the current Chu Feng was like a lamb at the slaughterhouse. He could only wait for the attack to come at him.<br>Without the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe and the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, Chu Feng simply possessed no means to contend against Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s incoming Immortal Technique.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, the Immortal Technique smashed into Chu Feng head-on.<br>Loud explosions began to sound as energy ripples surged. Not only was the surrounding water surging violently, but the powerful impulse from the attack even heaved the water upward. One could clearly see a pillar of water surging into the sky outside Buried Spirit Lake.<br>It took quite a while before the surroundings returned to normal. When the energy ripples from the Immortal Technique dissipated, Chu Feng was nowhere to be seen. Even his aura had disappeared completely.<br>Even though Chu Feng had been utterly destroyed by Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s Immortal Technique, the anger on Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face did not decrease.<br>It would appear that even though Chu Feng had been killed by her, the hatred Xia Yun&rsquo;er held for Chu Feng did not decrease in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;To speak a word in fairness, you really can&rsquo;t blame that Chu Feng. After all, it was you who decided to undress. He did not deliberately try to see you naked,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who&rsquo;s at fault,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said coldly.<br>This was the first time she had revealed such coldness and disrespect when speaking with Chu Lingxi.<br>However, Chu Lingxi did not look further into Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s somewhat disrespectful attitude. Instead, she smiled lightly, and then cast her gaze further into the depths of the Buried Spirit Lake.<br>Upon doing so, the smile on Chu lingxi&rsquo;s face grew even more profound.<br>As for Xia Yun&rsquo;er, perhaps she was so immersed in her hatred for Chu Feng that she did not notice the change in Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s smile at all.<br>In the depths of Buried Spirit Lake, five different elemental energies were currently rapidly diving down toward the deeper depths of the lake.<br>They only stopped after traveling downward for a long while.<br>The next moment, those five elemental energies started to fuse with one another. They took shape in the figure of a man. It was Chu Feng.<br>It turned out that Chu Feng actually didn&rsquo;t die.<br><br><br>Check out the June Giveaway for a chance to win $200, $100 or $50 Visa Gift Card<br><br></p></div>
