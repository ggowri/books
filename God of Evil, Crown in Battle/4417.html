        <h1>Chapter 4416</h1>
        <div>: Extremely Grateful<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Muzhi, this young friend was able to weave in a hidden formation within the formation you have provided within an incense&rsquo;s time, such that even you weren&rsquo;t able to notice it. Just on that in itself, it&rsquo;s already your loss.&rdquo;<br>Li Muzhi&rsquo;s grandfather said.<br>&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo;<br>Li Muzhi harrumphed indignantly before he turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Fine, I admit that it&rsquo;s my loss today. However, I have to say that your means are nothing compared to the true world spiritist prodigies in our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. That&rsquo;s also the reason why you are unable to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.&rdquo;<br>What Li Muzhi was saying was that while he admitted his defeat, he refused to acknowledge Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength.<br>Facing Li Muzhi&rsquo;s provocation, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t lose his temper. He simply smiled quietly in response.<br>Following that, he clasped his fist toward the sky and said, &ldquo;Elder, thank you for your acknowledgment. However, since I won this duel, I&rsquo;ll be counting on you for Yu Ting&rsquo;s matter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since this old man has agreed to your request, you need not worry about it. I&rsquo;ll speak up for Yu Ting, but I have to remind you once more that the Law Enforcement Hall has the final say regarding this matter,&rdquo; Li Muzhi&rsquo;s grandfather replied.<br>At the same moment, a suction force descended from above and pulled both Yu Ting and Li Muzhi up into the sky.<br>While the two of them were rising to the sky, their gazes were both fixated on Chu Feng, but the looks in their eyes were utterly different.<br>Yu Ting&rsquo;s gaze was filled with gratitude and a sliver of reluctance.<br>As Li Muzhi, his gaze was slightly more complicated. He was infuriated, especially since he was intending to use this opportunity to boast about his superior talent as a world spiritist, only to end up losing to Chu Feng.<br>For someone as proud as him, he was extremely displeased with this loss.<br>But what was interesting was that while indignance was practically written all over his face, he didn&rsquo;t carry too much hostility toward Chu Feng.<br>From this, it could be seen that while Li Muzhi was an arrogant person, he was not a bad person at heart.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, elder.&rdquo;<br>Once again, Chu Feng clasped his fist toward the air and spoke courteously.<br>He had no other choice. After all, he was the one who had a request over here, and Yu Ting&rsquo;s fate was dependent entirely on the mood of this elder.<br>That being said, it would appear that Li Muzhi&rsquo;s grandfather was a reasonable person, so it was likely that he would fulfill his promise.<br>If someone of the Ten Great Hidden Dragon Elders were to speak for Yu Ting, even if she couldn&rsquo;t be completely absolved of blame, the punishment that would befall her shouldn&rsquo;t be too severe. At the very least, she should be able to keep her life.<br>There was no response from the sky anymore, and the brilliant golden radiance that irradiated the entire Dragon Clan began to dissipate.<br>Soon, the golden radiance had completely vanished, but the fear in the hearts of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s clan members had yet to fade.<br>They still had no idea where the terrifying power that was in the sky a moment ago had come from.<br>In fact, even the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother couldn&rsquo;t help but feel cold shivers when they thought about what could have gone wrong.<br>That person who had just appeared was someone who possessed the strength to wipe their Dragon Clan away from the face of this world!<br>&ldquo;Father, is that person from before the sectmaster of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked.<br>Yu Ting hadn&rsquo;t told them about the matter regarding Li Mu and his grandfather, so they were still kept in the dark about the truth.<br>&ldquo;I heard that the sectmaster of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect is a woman, so that person was definitely not her. As for whether he&rsquo;s the vice sectmaster or not, based on what I know, the vice sectmaster is an extremely elusive figure, such that there&rsquo;s no one who knows his actual gender. It&rsquo;ll be hard to tell whether the person from before is him,&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief replied.<br>&ldquo;Even a vice sectmaster already wields such great power?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao was astonished.<br>The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect had often been mentioned alongside the Dragon Clan, so it was inevitable that she would think that they were of equal standing. However, from the looks of it now, it seemed like there was a great disparity between the two sects.<br>If even a vice sectmaster possessed the strength to suppress her father, it was hard to imagine just how powerful the sectmaster would be.<br>&ldquo;That person from before is neither the sectmaster nor the vice sectmaster. Rather, he&rsquo;s one of the Ten Great Hidden Dragon Elders from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;A Hidden Dragon Elder? He&rsquo;s only a Hidden Dragon elder?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother stared at Chu Feng with her mouth agape.<br>&ldquo;Mother, what&rsquo;s a Hidden Dragon Elder?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked.<br>&ldquo;The Hidden Dragon Elders are the ten strongest elders within the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, second to only the sectmaster and the vice sectmaster. Of course, most of what I know is hearsay. The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect is simply too elusive, such that no other power other than the Holy Light Clan has really come into contact with them before,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother said.<br>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that mean that even an elder of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect is already this powerful?&rdquo;<br>The shock on Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s face further intensified. It looked as if she had suffered a heavy blow.<br>All this while, she thought that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was equal to their Dragon Clan, only to find out that there was actually such a huge disparity between them.<br>Even a mere elder was already more than enough to crush their entire Dragon Clan.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how did you know that the person from before is a Hidden Dragon Elder?&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;Yu Ting is a disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. She was the one who informed me of the matter,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s Lady Yu who said that, it&rsquo;s most probably true. I have long heard that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect is filled with many hidden experts, but I didn&rsquo;t think that their strength would actually be this great. I reckon even the Holy Light Clan would have trouble trying to curb them,&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief remarked deeply.<br>There was no one present who wasn&rsquo;t shaken by the overwhelming power they had witnessed, all but the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>After all, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had known right from the start that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was strong enough to not pay any heed to the Holy Light Clan.<br>As for Chu Feng, he had also many sentiments regarding this.<br>He did hear a lot of rumors before, but nothing beat witnessing it in person. It was only a moment ago that he truly felt how deep the waters ran in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>Right now, the other galaxies looked down on the Holy Light Galaxy because the strength of the Holy Light Clan paled in comparison to the other powerhouses.<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t certain whether the unfathomable Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was really stronger than the Holy Light Clan or not, but if that was really the case, the Holy Light Clan would, in truth, not be as miserable as it appeared on the surface.<br>Perhaps, this might be a good thing for the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>After all, there was no one who wouldn&rsquo;t not want to take pride in the place he had come from. As someone from the Holy Light Galaxy, Chu Feng hoped that the Holy Light Galaxy would be able to stand unfalteringly before the other galaxies too.<br>There was no need for the Holy Light Galaxy to instill fear in others, but at the very least, it shouldn&rsquo;t draw scorn from others either.<br></p></div>
