        <h1>Chapter 3166</h1>
        <div> - Strange Gaze<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people gathered in the palace hall were practically all the upper echelons of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.<br>As such, the strongest battle power of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan had been gathered in the palace hall.<br>However, the appearance of Bai Liluo had caused many of the people present to panic.<br>Although the little girl appeared to be completely harmless, the people that had been in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm for a while, especially those from the Eastern Region, all knew how frightening she was.<br>&ldquo;Miss Liluo, what brings you here?&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing Bai Liluo, even Qingyu Ruize immediately walked up to her and greeted her with a very amiable attitude.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because we failed to find the Immortal River Crystal Ore this time, thus I&rsquo;ve come to give you all compensation,&rdquo; Bai Liluo spoke with a pouting mouth.<br>&ldquo;Alas, Miss Liluo, if you are to say it like that, you will truly regard us as outsiders.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Immortal River Crystal Ore is difficult to find to begin with. It&rsquo;s very normal for us to not find it. It cannot be blamed on you at all,&rdquo; Qingyu Ruize truly did not have any intention to blame Bai Liluo.<br>The reason for that was because he knew very well that they would have to entice Bai Liluo to join them. As for the Immortal River Crystal Ore, it was truly not an issue at all. What mattered was whether or not Bai Liluo was willing to join hands with them.<br>If he was capable of gaining Bai Liluo&rsquo;s assistance, there would be hope for him to rule over the entire Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s Eastern Region.<br>&ldquo;Regardless, it isn&rsquo;t good for me to return empty-handed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Just then, I heard from outside that you all are planning to suppress the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about this, this young lady will accompany you all there and capture that fellow by the name of Chu Feng. You can consider it my greeting gift to join your Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan,&rdquo; Bai Liluo said.<br>&ldquo;Miss Liluo, in that case, it means that you&rsquo;ve decided to become our Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s guest elder?&rdquo; At that moment, Qingyu Ruize was pleasantly surprised.<br>It was not only him; many of the others present revealed joyous looks upon hearing what Bai Liluo said.<br>Whilst Bai Liluo was a frightening character, she would not make things difficult for them should they not provoke her.<br>However, if she were to join their Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, with the strength that she possessed, it would be an enormously good thing for their Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.<br>&ldquo;Is there a need for this young lady to say it again?&rdquo; Bai Liluo spoke as she blinked her large eyes. Her innocent look made it very easy to bewilder others.<br>However, Qingyu Ruize knew very well that the girl before him was not at all innocent. Instead, she was a monster of rigorous schemes and deep foresight.<br>&ldquo;This is truly great. It&rsquo;s definitely our Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s honor to have Miss Liluo join our Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan as our guest elder. I must hold a banquet to celebrate this special occasion, and announce this joyous matter to everyone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will also prepare a great gift for Miss Liluo at the banquet,&rdquo; Qingyu Ruize spoke excitedly.<br>&ldquo;We can talk about that sort of thing in the future. Let us capture that Chu Feng first,&rdquo; Bai Liluo said.<br>&ldquo;Miss Liluo, there&rsquo;s no need for you to involve yourself in something like this. We two brothers will be able to handle this matter,&rdquo; Qingyu Yunlong said.<br>&ldquo;Why bother with the superfluous words? This young lady has said that she&rsquo;s going, so she&rsquo;s going. Furthermore, I&rsquo;ve decided to go precisely because I was afraid that you all would not be able to handle this matter. Of course, if you all can handle it, this young lady will not do anything,&rdquo; Bai Liluo said.<br>Hearing those words, Qingyu Yunlong immediately revealed an awkward and embarrassed expression.<br>He was actually feeling extremely displeased. However, he simply did not dare to express his displeasure.<br>&ldquo;Good, good, good. Since Miss Liluo wishes to go, it would mean that we will be able to put forth half the effort to gain twice the effect,&rdquo; Qingyu Ruize spoke with a beaming smile.<br>Then, his expression turned serious. He looked to the twins and shouted, &ldquo;Yunlong, Yunhu, the two of you must listen to Miss Liluo&rsquo;s orders! You are not allowed to disobey her, understand?!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the two brothers felt deep grievance.<br>Not to mention them not being allowed to disobey Bai Liluo&rsquo;s commands, even if they were allowed to, they would not dare to.<br>Who would go and offend a monster like her?<br>At that moment, in terms of feeling the most joyous, it was actually not the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen. Instead, it was Fenye Ganghao, who was kneeling on the ground.<br>He was already extremely confident after Qingyu Yunlong and Qingyu Yunhu were tasked with taking care of Chu Feng.<br>And now, after Bai Liluo voiced her desire to go take care of Chu Feng, he even began to feel sympathy for Chu Feng.<br>In terms of cruel torture abilities, everyone had a few. After all, the world of martial cultivators had never lacked cruel and ruthless cultivators.<br>However, Bai Liluo was the only person that was capable of being deemed a monster in the entire Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s Eastern Region.<br>From this, one could imagine how terrifyingly cruel Bai Liluo&rsquo;s torture methods were.<br>Her reputation as a monster was fully deserved.<br>Suddenly, Fenye Ganghao said, &ldquo;Milords, I also wish to accompany you all there,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The fuck would you be capable of doing by going there?&rdquo; Qingyu Yunlong spoke with slight displeasure.<br>Hearing those words from Qingyu Yunlong, Fenye Ganghao immediately closed his mouth and did not dare utter another word.<br>Right at that moment, Bai Liluo suddenly spoke, &ldquo;Let him accompany us. The others from the Burnfield Monstrous Clan are also allowed to accompany us.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Fenye Ganghao was immediately overjoyed. He began to thank Bai Liluo repeatedly.<br>The reason for that was because he knew that no one would object to it now that Bai Liluo had spoken. Even Qingyu Ruize would not object to it. After all, they would all give Bai Liluo face.<br>Upon thinking that he would be able to personally witness the misery that Bai Liluo would unleash upon Chu Feng, Fenye Ganghao felt incomparably refreshed.<br>Afterwards, accompanying the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, Fenye Ganghao and the others from the Burnfield Monstrous Clan also began to travel to the location where Chu Feng and the others were.<br>However, as Chu Feng had forcibly imbued their bodies with the bug, the people from the Burnfield Monstrous Clan were only capable of kneeling on the ground, unable to make any other movement.<br>After pondering for some time, Fenye Ganghao decided to seek help from Bai Liluo. He knew that if Bai Liluo was to help, she would definitely be able to remove the bugs in their bodies and allow them to regain their freedom to move about normally. &ldquo;Lady Liluo, I&rsquo;ve heard that your world spirit techniques are exceptionally powerful. Might you be able to help remove the bugs in our bodies, allowing us to return to normal again?&rdquo;<br>However, after Fenye Ganghao spoke, Qingyu Yunlong and the others started frowning.<br>Whilst Bai Liluo had an innocent look to her, she was actually an extremely ruthless and cruel individual. Even they did not dare to provoke her. Yet, that Fenye Ganghao actually dared to directly ask her to help them?<br>The way Qingyu Yunlong and the others saw it, Fenye Ganghao&rsquo;s action was simply akin to courting death.<br>However, to their surprise, Bai Liluo&rsquo;s attitude at that moment was particularly good. Not only was she not angry, she instead smiled sweetly at Fenye Ganghao. With a child-like voice, she said, &ldquo;That is something bestowed to you all by that Chu Feng. As such, he should be the one to remove it from your bodies. At that time, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to have him kneel before you all to remove the spirit formations he placed in your bodies?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words from Bai Liluo, Fenye Ganghao and everyone else from the Burnfield Monstrous Clan became endlessly excited.<br>When recalling how they were tortured to such a state by Chu Feng, they still felt extreme pain. It was most definitely the greatest humiliation of their entire lives.<br>However, if they were able to have Chu Feng kneel before them and beg them for forgiveness, they would be able to retrieve their lost dignity. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be even better?<br>Because of that, Fenye Ganghao and the others from the Burnfield Monstrous Clan all began to express their thanks to Bai Liluo.<br>In fact, many among them were so moved that their eyes started streaming with tears. It was as if Bai Liluo were their great benefactor. They were filled with gratefulness toward her.<br>However, none of them noticed that whilst they were expressing their thanks to Bai Liluo, a strange light flashed through her clear eyes.<br>If anyone were to witness that light, they would definitely feel their blood run cold, and begin to tremble with fear.<br></p></div>
