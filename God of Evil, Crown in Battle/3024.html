        <h1>Chapter 3023</h1>
        <div> - Someone&rsquo;s Coming<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Haha, the heavens have eyes. Chu Feng, oh Chu Feng, it would appear that even the heavens do not wish for you to use that Demon Armament,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan was laughing loudly. This was the first time Chu Feng had seen Chu Youyuan so happy.<br>Even to that Exalted-level expert, being able to escape the spatial tunnel was a very happy thing.<br>Actually, that was quite understandable. Like Chu Feng, Chu Youyuan would also want to obtain revenge.<br>As long as they escaped, they would be able to seek their revenge.<br>Suddenly, Chu Youyuan shouted, &ldquo;Chu Feng, prepare yourself, this old man is going to start now!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Youyuan, go ahead and start. This junior is prepared. I will definitely not drag you down,&rdquo; Chu Feng arrived beside Chu Youyuan and tightly grabbed his clothes.<br>Following the current of the spatial tunnel, Chu Youyuan finally approached that spatial crack. Like sharp blades, Chu Youyuan thrust his hands directly into the spatial crack.<br>&ldquo;Eaaahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, Chu Youyuan let out a roar.<br>At the same time, powerful Exalted-level martial power was emitted from his body in an unceasing flow.<br>His powerful arms started to bulge tightly. Chu Youyuan was planning to use his arms to forcibly tear a hole through the spatial crack.<br>Only by tearing a hole through the spatial crack would he and Chu Feng be able to enter the spatial crack and leave the spatial tunnel.<br>&ldquo;Snap~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Snap~~~&rdquo;<br>As Chu Youyuan continued to exert even greater power, the spatial crack started growing bigger. It was actually showing signs of tearing apart.<br>However, as Chu Youyuan was trying his best to rip a hole through the spatial crack, Chu Feng was also under enormous pressure.<br>The power of the current was too strong. The reason why Chu Feng and Chu Youyuan were not moving along with the current was because Chu Youyuan was grabbing the spatial crack with his hands.<br>At the same time, the power of the current was impacting the two of them.<br>The situation was better off for Chu Youyuan. After all, he was a rank two Exalted-level expert. By grabbing onto the spatial crack, he was still able to endure the power of the current.<br>However, Chu Feng was unable to do so. Being only a rank four Heavenly Immortal, it was very difficult for him to withstand the pressure of the current.<br>Most importantly, the pressure from the current was something that no treasure or ability could stop. One could only withstand it using one&rsquo;s body.<br>Thus, Chu Youyuan was unable to help Chu Feng. At this moment, Chu Feng could only rely on his own power to withstand the impact from the current.<br>Chu Feng simply had no heart to worry about how much of a hole Chu Youyuan was able to tear through the spatial crack. The reason for that was because he was feeling as if his body would shatter, feeling as if his soul would explode, as if he could die at any moment.<br>Gradually, Chu Feng&rsquo;s line of sight grew fuzzy. He was about to lose consciousness. However, his hands were still tightly grabbing onto Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s clothes. He was unwilling to let go. He knew that if he were to let go, he might end up missing this opportunity to escape.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at the moment when Chu Feng was about to lose consciousness, light suddenly blossomed before him.<br>The next moment, Chu Feng felt himself flying toward the light.<br>&ldquo;Putt,&rdquo; Chu Feng smashed into the ground. However, he was feeling overjoyed.<br>The reason for that was because he was able to smell the ground, smell trees and plants, and even hear the sounds of birds.<br>He knew that he had escaped from the spatial tunnel, and returned to the real world.<br>Gradually, Chu Feng&rsquo;s line of sight began to recover. He discovered that he was on a mountain. Sure enough, he had returned.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you&rsquo;ve succeeded. You&rsquo;ve successfully brought me&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, what&rsquo;s wrong? Senior, what is&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was wild with joy. However, when he saw Chu Youyuan, his expression immediately changed.<br>Chu Feng was astonished to discover that Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s arms were covered in blood. Only bloody bones remained on his arms. All of the flesh and muscle on the bones had disappeared. It seemed like they were ripped away from him.<br>Not only that, but Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s aura was extremely weak. His injury was simply much more serious than when he was attacked by Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather.<br>&ldquo;Was it that spatial crack? Did that spatial crack injure you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with concern.<br>&ldquo;Yeah. The power of that spatial crack was much stronger than this old man imagined it to be. I had to risk my life to rip a hole through it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, in the end, we managed to get out. We&rsquo;ve managed to get out. Haha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Although Chu Youyuan was seriously injured, he was not at all depressed. Instead, he started to laugh.<br>Even though his laughter was very weak, Chu Feng was still able to tell how joyous he felt.<br>That&rsquo;s right. Although he was seriously injured, it remained that they&rsquo;d escaped.<br>As long as they escaped, they would be able to return to the Chu Heavenly Clan and get revenge against those two Supreme Elders.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please take this medicinal pellet,&rdquo; Chu Feng did not care about his own injuries, and immediately took out his best medicinal pellet to give to Chu Youyuan.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me. This old man merely needs to recuperate for some time to completely recover from this,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan waved his hand with a smile on his face. He was telling Chu Feng to not worry about him. However, he did not refuse Chu Feng&rsquo;s kind intentions, and accepted Chu Feng's medicinal pellet and swallowed it.<br>&ldquo;Mn?&rdquo; Suddenly, Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s expression changed. He turned his gaze deep into the mountain.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It seems like someone&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan said.<br><br><br></p></div>
