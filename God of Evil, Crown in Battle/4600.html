        <div>: I&rsquo;ll Be Taking This Treasure<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Courting death? If this is what you consider to be courting death, I should probably tell you that I do such stuff pretty often. However, what can I do about it? I happen to be a cultivator, and I can&rsquo;t stand those who bully the weak, especially beasts who take advantage of women.<br>&ldquo;Beasts like you, I, Chu Feng, would usually whip one in place if I see one.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked at Yin Tianchou with eyes filled with disdain.<br>&ldquo;So, the reason behind this is that woman?&rdquo;<br>Yin Tianchou didn&rsquo;t lose his temper after hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words; instead, his expression alleviated a little.<br>&ldquo;Brother, do you know I am? Have you ever considered if it&rsquo;s worth it making an enemy out of me for her?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Disciple of the Fire Yama, Yin Tianchou. Am I right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Since you know who I am, why are you still making an enemy out of me?&rdquo; Yin Tianchou looked at Chu Feng intently, wanting to know his true thoughts.<br>&ldquo;You appear to have quite the reputation in the Nine Souls Galaxy, but that doesn&rsquo;t hinder me from killing you. It&rsquo;s not as if anyone will know that I&rsquo;m the culprit anyway.&rdquo;<br>Right after saying those words, Chu Feng released his spirit power into the ground and sealed off the area. To be more accurate, it wasn&rsquo;t just spirit power but a formation, an isolation formation. He didn&rsquo;t want anyone to see his battle with Yin Tianchou.<br>&ldquo;Rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation? Interesting. It&rsquo;s no wonder why you dare to oppose me so confidently. Since that&rsquo;s the case, I should just tell you the truth. Even if you had obediently handed your key over to me, I still wouldn&rsquo;t have let you off. Both you and the woman must die!&rdquo;<br>As Yin Tianchou said those words, a vile smile crept onto his lips as the murderous intent in his eyes intensified.<br>He had cloaked himself in sheepskin in order to have some fun, but in truth, he was a vile wolf through and through. He had finally chosen to reveal his true self.<br>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t fear Yin Tianchou either. Even if he didn&rsquo;t bear any grudge toward Yin Tianchou, after seeing the pitiful plight the woman was in, he had already resolved himself to take Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s life.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t view himself as a warrior of justice, but that didn&rsquo;t hinder him from killing these disgusting beasts!<br>Boom boom boom!<br>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had already begun clashing with one another.<br>Due to the limitations imposed by their surroundings, the two of them were unable to tap into their martial power. Nevertheless, the force they summoned was still incredibly impressive.<br>The woman inside the gunny sack was intending to flee the area after recovering from her injuries, but upon seeing the clash between the two young men before her, she couldn&rsquo;t help but freeze in place.<br>&ldquo;Who is he? H-how can he be so powerful?&rdquo;<br>The women stared at Chu Feng in astonishment.<br>She had long heard of just how formidable Yin Tianchou was. He was a terrifying being who was able to defeat hundreds of rank six Utmost Exalted level cultivators with his rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>But shockingly, this foreign man was also exerting a force that was on par with Yin Tianchou!<br>This made the woman realize that Chu Feng was also of notable background. Thus, instead of escaping, she decided to head to a safe distance away before peeking on the two of them.<br>&ldquo;How amusing! I thought that I had found a helpless victim, but you&rsquo;re stronger than I thought. It&rsquo;s no wonder why you dare to oppose me! How exhilarating! It&rsquo;s much more interesting to kill a prodigy like you than to handle mere trash!&rdquo;<br>Yin Tianchou showed no fear upon realizing that Chu Feng was stronger than he thought. On the contrary, he began laughing excitedly.<br>It showed his confidence to defeat Chu Feng no matter what happened.<br>And Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s composure unnerved Chu Feng a little.<br>Chu Feng was not a weakling. He had been through many storms, and he could remain calm regardless of what happened. He had heard of Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s formidable prowess as a world spiritist beforehand, but he had confidence in his own skills too.<br>Despite only being at rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation, which was only on par with a rank four Utmost Exalted level cultivator, he was still able to match against Yin Tianchou.<br>The reason for that was his Nine Dragons Saint Cloak and his world spiritist bloodline. These two powers raised his fighting prowess by two tiers, allowing him to match against rank six Utmost Exalted level cultivators.<br>As such, he thought that he would be able to win against Yin Tianchou with fair ease with his skills. Yet, despite having exerted everything he had, he found himself being unable to defeat Yin Tianchou.<br>Yin Tianchou was much stronger than he had thought.<br>At this rate, he would have to rely on the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk, but he wasn&rsquo;t certain if he could really rely on it. Despite the whisk&rsquo;s formidable strength, he was unable to fully control it.<br>If the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk was willing to help him, he could easily construct a formation that could kill a rank one Martial Exalted level cultivator. But if it wasn&rsquo;t, all Chu Feng could do was to raise the prowess of his formations by a little.<br>In other words, he wasn&rsquo;t fully certain that he could defeat Yin Tianchou.<br>Furthermore, Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s confidence meant that he still had other cards that he hadn&rsquo;t used yet,<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time to end this game, lad!&rdquo;<br>After clashing a few more times, Yin Tianchou suddenly backed away. A silver bowl appeared in his hands.<br>Yin Tianchou began forming hand seals with a single hand, inducing blue runes to appear and swim around freely like fishes on the surface of the silver bowl. Following that, his fighting prowess began to rise quickly.<br>It was a treasure that could enhance one&rsquo;s spirit power.<br>Chu Feng was right. Yin Tianchou did have a trump card.<br>Under such circumstances, Chu Feng dared not to hold back anymore. He quickly took out the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk too.<br>However, to his disappointment, it wasn&rsquo;t showing any special effects. In other words, the whisk had chosen not to grant him greater help.<br>That being said, the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk was still a rare treasure. Even without unlocking its true powers, Chu Feng could still raise the prowess of his spirit power considerably through it.<br>At the very least, he should be able to stand on equal grounds with Yin Tianchou.<br>&ldquo;Oh ho, you had such a treasure with you? Looks like it isn&rsquo;t a wasted trip for me!&rdquo; Yin Tianchou exclaimed.<br>He could tell that Chu Feng was raising his spirit power through the whisk in his hand, and he began laughing frenziedly. He began infusing his spirit power into the silver bowl covered in gleaming blue runes while launching attacks toward Chu Feng.<br>Even though the silver bowl had an ugly appearance, its prowess was not to be scoffed at. Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s attacks were at least severalfold stronger than before.<br>Faced with such an opponent, Chu Feng only seemed to grow even more excited. While clashing with Yin Tianchou, his eyes fell on the latter&rsquo;s silver bowl, and he thought to himself.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be taking that treasure for myself!&rdquo;<br></p></div>
