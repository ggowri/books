        <div> - Selfishness<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Do you all really believe that that Infant Soul Grand Formation will be able to help you all increase your cultivation?&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, Chu Feng stood up and looked to the crowd with a mocking expression.<br>&ldquo;We have witnessed the power of that Infant Soul Grand Formation. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we believe it?&rdquo; Someone asked in refute.<br>After the first person refuted him, more and more people started to refute Chu Feng.<br>It would be one thing if it were the bystanders that were refuting Chu Feng. However, many of the people that were refuting Chu Feng were from upright and righteous sects and schools, people that were originally part of the allied army.<br>Oh how ironic this scene was. These people that originally came to crusade against the Infant Soul Sect were now standing on the side of the Infant Soul Sect all so that they could increase their cultivation.<br>This was most definitely selfishness.<br>&ldquo;You all already have your eyes blinded by greed. Anything I say now will be useless. However, do not blame me for not having warned you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Infant Soul Grand Formation is most definitely unable to increase your cultivations. For you all to believe the Infant Soul Sect, only one end can come of it -- death,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, while it is true that our Infant Soul Sect and you have clashed with one another before, it is all because of your misunderstanding toward our Infant Soul Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And now, I have already explained everything. Even our decision to sacrifice those infants was done because we had no other choice.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Must you insist on viewing us as enemies?&rdquo; The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster spoke with an expression of helplessness.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Little friend Chu Feng, anyone can mistakes. When possible, it is best to forgive. This is even more so the case when the Infant Soul Sect has done their wrongdoings for the sake of benefiting everyone.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, many people began to speak on behalf of the Infant Soul Sect.<br>&ldquo;For the sake of benefiting everyone? Are you to say that just because this matter is beneficial to you all that those infants can be slaughtered?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If those infants were your children, would you all continue to blabber on like this?&rdquo; Zi Xunyi asked furiously.<br>&ldquo;For the sake of a better future, so what if we have to sacrifice some lives? If we can allow the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to become more prosperous, even if it were my children, I would be willing to sacrifice them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I too would be willing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The world of martial cultivators is one filled with disputes to begin with. People die every day here. However, were those people that died able to contribute to the betterment of our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm? No matter what, those infants have not died in vain. Their sacrifice was not made in vain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Their deaths were worthy. It is also something that we should accept.&rdquo;<br>The crowd spoke in succession. They who had come to exterminate the Infant Soul Sect for the sake of those slaughtered infants were now turning their arguments around and declaring that it was right for those infants to be slaughtered.<br>&ldquo;You all&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing those words, Zi Xunyi was so furious her face turned pale. Then, a mouthful of blood sprayed out of her mouth.<br>She actually vomited blood out of anger.<br>However, that was understandable too. The scene at hand was truly extremely infuriating. However, they were powerless to do anything.<br>&ldquo;Xunyi!!!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, Ying Mingchao, whose state had changed for the better thanks to Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi&rsquo;s healing, grew incomparably furious.<br>He stood up and turned his gaze filled with killing intent toward the surrounding crowd. He said, &ldquo;The ones that should be killed are you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Ying Mingchao finished saying those words, the dark black gaseous flames that covered the sky immediately let out intense killing intent. The intense killing intent was completely aimed at Ying Mingchao.<br>It was the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Ying Mingchao, I will not take offense at you attacking me. However, if you dare try to harm them, I, Hun Poyuan, will definitely not allow you to do so,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>After this happened, Ying Mingchao started to shiver in anger. As for those who had spoken on behalf of the Infant Soul Sect, they were overjoyed. It was as if they have found a backer. One by one, they became more and more pleased with themselves, more and more insolent in their actions.<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, Chu Feng burst into loud laughter. He was laughing so hard that his body started to rock back and forth. He was laughing so hard that his body started to tremble.<br>&ldquo;You all have truly opened my eyes with how foolish you are. Seniors, let&rsquo;s go. For people like them, we do not have to concern ourselves with their life and death. Let them perish on their own.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng said to Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;<br>Ying Mingchao stopped hesitating. He led the crowd and decided to leave.<br>Ying Mingchao was extremely furious. He had originally led the crowd to come and crusade against the Infant Soul Sect.<br>However, in the end, not only had the allied army collapsed, but he himself had become the target of the crowd&rsquo;s scorn.<br>Ying Mingchao, Chu Feng and the others left. That said, not a single person felt uneasy or guilty from their leaving.<br>Not only were they not feeling dejected, but they instead grew even more pleased and overjoyed.<br>At this moment, Ying Mingchao, Chu Feng and others were no longer heroes in their hearts.<br>Instead, they had become malignant stars that blocked their path to increase their cultivation. As such, how could they not be delighted when these malignant stars decided to leave?<br>At this moment when the crowd were immersed in their foolish joy, no one noticed that the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster revealed a wicked smile on his face after Ying Mingchao and the others left.<br>That smile was extremely frightening. It was completely different from the gentleness that he had disguised himself with earlier.<br>That said, the people present did not notice his smile. In fact, even if they did, no one would find anything wrong with it.<br>It was as Chu Feng had said, these people had already had their eyes blinded by greed.<br>&ldquo;Truly foolish.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded from above the sky that was covered by the black gaseous flames.<br>Merely, not a single one of the tens of thousands of people below was able to hear that voice.<br>That voice sounded from a certain corner above the sky. At that place&hellip; stood three figures.<br>They were a middle-aged man, a middle-aged woman and a white-haired old man.<br>The middle-aged man had a mature appearance. The middle-aged woman still possessed a trace of childish nature in her gaze.<br>Both the man and the woman were True Immortal-level experts.<br>As for that old man, his cultivation was unfathomable.<br>From the outfits of these three people, as well as the title plates on their waist, it could be seen that they were all from a single power.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>At this moment, these three people from the Chu Heavenly Clan were looking down at everything that was happening below like gods high above.<br>&ldquo;Truly foolish. They were actually deceived by such a lie,&rdquo; The woman said mockingly.<br>&ldquo;That is the nature of martial cultivators. For strength and power, they are willing to kill even their relatives. As for mere betrayals, that&rsquo;s extremely common,&rdquo; the middle-aged man said.<br>&ldquo;Merely, that Chu Feng, Ying Mingchao and the others are going to suffer. Should we help them? After all, it seems that Senior Chu Xuanlang thought quite highly of that Chu Feng,&rdquo; The middle-aged woman asked.<br>The middle-aged man did not answer her. Instead, he looked to the white-haired old man.<br>&ldquo;If we are to interfere, we will have gone against the rules established by our Ancestor. Perhaps&hellip; this is the fate of that Chu Feng,&rdquo; the old man said slowly.<br>&ldquo;What Elder said is very correct,&rdquo; the middle-aged man and middle-aged woman voiced in agreement.<br><br></p></div>
