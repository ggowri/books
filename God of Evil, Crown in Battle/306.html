        <h1>Chapter 306</h1>
        <div> - Black-Hearted Father<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>After helping his family, Li Zhangqing, and the others settle in, Chu Feng left the Azure Dragon School and went forward to the Vermilion Bird City because currently, within the Azure Province, there were still two more people who Chu Feng could not let go. They were Su Rou and Su Mei, the two beautiful sisters.<br>Relying on his sharp Spirit power, when Chu Feng arrived outside of the Vermilion Bird City, he discovered that there were actually layers of detection Spirit Formations laid by a Grey-cloak World Spiritist, and within the Vermilion Bird City, he felt that there were many people who did not belong to the Vermilion Bird City hidden within.<br>All of that told Chu Feng that the current Vermilion Bird City was very possibly a trap, yet he had to jump into the trap or else he could not save the two sisters Su Rou and Su Mei.<br>Chu Feng sneaked into the Vermilion Bird City and he first went to both Su Rou&rsquo;s and Su Mei&rsquo;s residences, but he discovered that the two of them weren&rsquo;t there. Because of that, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but start to worry and at the end, he sneaked into Su Hen residence and he wanted to find some clues from him.<br>Indeed, &ldquo;The heavens do not disappoint those who persevere&rdquo;, and not long after Chu Feng sneaked into Su Hen&rsquo;s palace, Su Hen hurried back from outside and he even brought three guests along. It was a Grey-cloak World Spiritist from the Lingyun School.<br>As for the other two people, they were both old people. One had black-hair as black as ink, and the other had white-hair as white as snow. They were the peak experts of the Lingyun School, and they were two of the Twelve Protectors.<br>&ldquo;They are indeed the people from the Lingyun School. Let&rsquo;s see what tricks all of you are playing with.&rdquo; Chu Feng did not immediately go out to question Su Hen. He concealed his aura, hid in a corner, and silently observed every single movement and action of the three people.<br>&ldquo;Heh. Milords, please sit.&rdquo;<br>After entering the hall, Su Hen was like a submissive servant and he nodded and bowed towards the three people from the Lingyun School as he poured tea for them. For the first time, Chu Feng discovered that the lord of the Vermilion Bird City had such top-level bootlicking skills!<br>&ldquo;City Lord Su Hen, it seems what you said wasn&rsquo;t too true! You said that Chu Feng loves your two daughters so much that he could go between life and death for them. So, after knowing that your two daughters cut off their relationship with him, he should certainly come here to ask why. But why, after so many days have passed, are there no news about Chu Feng?&rdquo; The white-haired Protector asked.<br>&ldquo;Eh...This...&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps Chu Feng has weak love and little righteousness, or perhaps Chu Feng already escaped the Azure Province and left my two daughters behind!&rdquo; Su Hen chuckled and explained.<br>&ldquo;Then that means that your two daughters have really loved the wrong person. But even if Chu Feng comes, he would only be sending himself to his death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;City Lord Su Hen, your two daughters are two rare beauties, but sadly they have been contaminated by Chu Feng and they are still not willing to cut off their relationship with Chu Feng even up until now. I&rsquo;m afraid that this will affect the future development of your Su family! After all, this time, it is the lordof the Qilin Prince&rsquo;s Mansion speaking, and he wants to completely kill every single person who is related to Chu Feng.&rdquo; The black-haired Protector spoke.<br>&ldquo;Ehh...Milords, this...&rdquo; After hearing those words, Su Hen was not lightly frightened. He wanted to explain, yet he did not know how to explain and he started to stutter.<br>&ldquo;Hey, City Lord Su Hen, you don&rsquo;t need to be afraid. Actually, right now, I have a method that can save both you and your two daughters.&rdquo; The black-haired old man smiled and said.<br>&ldquo;Milords, please.&rdquo;<br>Su Hen quickly asked. Although the three people in front of them were people from the Lingyun School, because their strength were overbearing and had a close relationship with the Qilin Prince&rsquo;s Mansion, Su Hen truly did not dare to offend them. Rather, he was very afraid of them.<br>As he looked at Su Hen&rsquo;s face full of fear, the black-haired old man said, &ldquo;The ones who harmed you were your two daughters, and the ones who can save you are still your two daughters.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Without hiding the truth, Lord World Spiritist of my Lingyun School has not married yet even to this date. However, it was love at first sight towards your two daughters. If you marry your two daughters over to him, who would dare to even touch your Su family?&rdquo; The black-haired Protector spoke.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I received a secret news, and it was that the Grey-cloak World Spiritist from the Qilin Prince&rsquo;s Mansion suddenly disappeared. Right now, there is absolutely no information on him and it is very possible that he has met with misfortune. So, within the current borders of the Azure Province, our Lord World Spiritist is the only Grey-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even the Qilin Prince&rsquo;s Mansion treats him respectfully and well. Su Hen. If you marry your daughter off to Lord World Spiritist, in the future, your Su family will certainly rise greatly.&rdquo; Just at that time, the white-haired Protector spoke to urge as well.<br>&ldquo;Ehh...Lord World Spiritist, you...truly want to marry my two daughters?&rdquo; Su hen was also quite shocked as he faced the sudden news.<br>&ldquo;Heh. That&rsquo;s right. City Lord Su Hen, if you are willing to marry Su Rou and Su Mei over to me, I will certainly not treat you bad.&rdquo; But perhaps he was too excited and happy, the Grey-cloak World Spiritist took his hood off which was covering his face, and revealed his incomparably ugly appearance.<br>It had to be said that the old guy&rsquo;s looks were truly, extremely ugly. Shrimp-nose, triangular-eyes, pumpkin-head, pockmarked face, and he was even bald.<br>&ldquo;Huu...&rdquo;<br>After seeing the appearance of the Grey-cloak World Spiritist, Su Hen instantly took in a breath of cool air. Most likely, it was also his first time that he had seen such an ugly old man.<br>But after remembering his special identity, powerful strength, and strong background, he forcefully suppressed his shocked expression and said while smiling,<br>&ldquo;Not only will it be my honor to betroth my daughters over to you, Lord World Spiritist, it will also be the honor of my Su family&rsquo;s ancestors.&rdquo; As he spoke, Su Hen walked out.<br>Shortly after Su Hen walked out, the white-haired Protector spoke to the Grey-cloak World Spiritist, &ldquo;Milord, are you really going to marry those sisters? Right now, the school head and the mansion lordhave given a death order, and as long as the person had a close relationship with Chu Feng, no matter if they announced that they cut off their relationship off from him or not, they were still to be beheaded.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ahh, you really don&rsquo;t understand me well, but will I not understand the character of Lord School Head?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Su Rou and Su Mei are rare beauties. Within all the girls that I have seen, these two girls are absolutely the most beautiful. The only person who can be compared to those two is only Yan Ruyu from the Jade Maiden School.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would truly be a shame if such beauties were killed off. But wouldn&rsquo;t it be a bigger shame to not experience how they taste?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In a while when Su Hen calls them over, I will take that chance and bring the two of them into my room. You two also come as well to nicely enjoy these two rare beauties.&rdquo; The Grey-cloak World Spiritist smiled and said lecherously.<br>&ldquo;Haha, thank you Lord World Spiritist.&rdquo; After hearing the World Spiritist&rsquo;s words, the two old Protectors were also endlessly joyful and they revealed lustful smiles as well. There were even some reactions from the lower body. It could be seen that the two of them already had malicious intents towards the sisters Su Rou and Su Mei.<br>&ldquo;Damn. These three lewd old guys has plans with my Su Rou and Su Mei? Later on, I will certainly make all of you pay the price.&rdquo; Chu Feng who was hiding in a corner and saw every single thing was already consumed by anger and cracking noises sounded from the clenching of his fists.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s also that Su Hen. He&rsquo;s the most worthless one. Chu Feng, you must finish Su Hen off or else who knows how he will deceive your Su Rou and Su Mei again.&rdquo; Eggy&rsquo;s little face also redden from anger as she grinded her teeth. She truly could not accept it. Su Hen, as a father, was selling his own daughters in such a way.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Not a single one should even think of escaping.&rdquo; In reality, even if Eggy did not remind him, Chu Feng was already determined.<br>It had to be said that Su Hen&rsquo;s efficiency in doing work was rather fast, and with a split moment, the closed door was reopened. With a full face of solicitousness, Su Hen walked in and there were even two beauties with absolute prettiness and extremely good figures following behind him. They were Su Rou and Su Mei.<br></p></div>
