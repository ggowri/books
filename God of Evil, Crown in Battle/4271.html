        <div> - Too Late<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was killed by the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.<br>Everything happened too suddenly. Many people present were utterly shocked.<br>On one hand, the crowd gasped with admiration at how ruthless the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted was.<br>On the other hand, they felt what the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted did to be very correct.<br>After all, even they felt like the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was not qualified to be Chu Feng&rsquo;s master.<br>As such, they were able to understand why someone would kill the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. In fact, what the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted did was something they wished for.<br>But, compared to the bystanders that were enjoying a show, Chu Feng was furious.<br>The instant he saw the Ox-nosed Old Daoist being killed, he was truly burning with rage and wanted to attack the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.<br>It was an anger he was unwilling to let go of even though he knew fully that he would not be a match for the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.<br>But, when Chu Feng noticed how Grandmaster Tang Chen had no change in expression and was instead smiling, he suddenly realized that things were not as simple as he thought.<br>Since Grandmaster Tang Chen was a close friend of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, he wouldn&rsquo;t possibly be able to smile after his close friend was killed.<br>Thus, while Chu Feng was unsure of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s current strength, he judged from Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s reaction that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist would not be killed by the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted that easily.<br>Likely, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was feigning death!<br>Even though the anger in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart lessened a lot after confirming that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist didn&rsquo;t die, his hatred for the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted did not decrease.<br>Regardless of whether or not the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was killed, it remains a fact that the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted had tried to kill him.<br>Chu Feng will definitely not forgive him easily.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t look at me like that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could a nameless nobody like that possibly be able to become your master?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am helping you here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re unable to understand it right now. Perhaps you might even hate me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, one day, you will realize that I&rsquo;m doing this for your own good.&rdquo;<br>Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted was panicking slightly and began to try very hard to justify his behavior after seeing the anger in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>After all, he wanted Chu Feng to seek him to become his master.<br>He knew that his action of killing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist would offend Chu Feng.<br>But, there was nothing else he could do. At least he would have a chance should he kill the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>But, if he doesn&rsquo;t, he would have no chance at all.<br>&ldquo;A despicable vile man that acts unscrupulously for your goal actually has the nerve to want me to seek you to become my master?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let me tell you this. I, Chu Feng, will never take you as my master in my entire life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, it&rsquo;s possible for you to become the next departed soul under my hands,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words, the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted narrowed his brows.<br>From the attitude Chu Feng displayed, he was unable to see a trace of hope.<br>But, seeing the same thing, Grandmaster Luo Tuo began to beam with happiness. He felt that his chance had arrived.<br>Thus, he said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;What young friend Chu Feng said is extremely correct. Someone as despicable and vile as him couldn&rsquo;t possibly become your master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better that this old man become your master instead.&rdquo;<br>But, after hearing the words spoken by Grandmaster Luo Tuo, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;You are the same as that Ghost-face. You&rsquo;re only qualified to become a departed soul under my hands.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Luo Tuo narrowed his brows. He was feeling flustered and exasperated after being refused by Chu Feng in such a manner.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, wind swept forth and the heaven and earth began to tremble. Even the space itself was deforming under the pressure.<br>Turned out, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain was undergoing a change.<br>Before the crowd&rsquo;s very eyes, the spirit formation around the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain was weakening. In the end, it completely disappeared.<br>At the beginning, the crowd were skeptical. But, they soon discovered that the spirit formation had really disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh---&rdquo;<br>Once the spirit formation disappeared, many figures rushed forth like a torrential rain. From all directions and at the same time, they were flying toward the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>Lu Jie&rsquo;s senior brothers and sisters arrived beside Lu Jie. They immediately brought him out from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain and began to treat his injuries.<br>Before leaving, they did not forget to fiercely glare at Chu Feng.<br>But, none of them attacked Chu Feng.<br>The reason for that was because they knew that Chu Feng was not someone that they can attack now.<br>Even if they tried to attack him, there would be people that would protect him.<br>In fact, if they rashly attack him, they might court a calamity upon themselves.<br>Although very unwilling, reason was telling them that it was best to keep a clear head at a time like this.<br>Apart from Lu Jie&rsquo;s senior brothers and sisters that came in to rescue Lu Jie, Grandmaster Tang Chen, Yuan Shu and Yu Ting had rushed over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side.<br>Without the existence of the spirit formation barrier, Chu Feng was exposed to people&rsquo;s attacks. Grandmaster Tang Chen was worried for Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety and was especially on guard against the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted and Grandmaster Luo Tuo.<br>As for the others, they all rushed toward the stele.<br>After all, the stele contained the inheritance.<br>To the crowd&rsquo;s surprise, they were all able to approach the stele and even touch it.<br>But, none of them were able to obtain the inheritance. No matter what method they try, it was all useless.<br>This gave the crowd a massive headache.<br>If they cannot receive the inheritance with their own abilities, it would mean that there would only be one possible way -- they would need to become Chu Feng&rsquo;s master.<br>But, this hope was simply too remote. The crowd felt that it was practically impossible for them to become Chu Feng&rsquo;s master.<br>&ldquo;Boom---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, an explosion was heard and energy ripples began to wreak havoc.<br>Many people were sent flying by the energy ripples. In less serious cases, they were seriously injured. In more serious cases, they were killed by the energy ripples.<br>Someone had attacked the stele.<br>Wanting to obtain the inheritance inside, someone had tried to destroy the stele using martial power.<br>The person who attacked the stele was Grandmaster Luo Tuo.<br>&ldquo;Luo Tuo, have you gone mad?&rdquo;<br>Both the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted and Celestial Fairy Muzhi were furious after seeing Grandmaster Luo Tuo attack the stele.<br>They were not fearful of the destruction of the stele. Rather, they were afraid of the inheritance inside being damaged.<br>&ldquo;So what? Isn&rsquo;t it completely fine?&rdquo; said Grandmaster Luo Tuo in irritation.<br>Hearing those words, the crowd looked over to the stele and discovered that it was completely undamaged.<br>But, merely the energy ripples from Grandmaster Luo Tuo&rsquo;s attack was enough to cause serious injuries and even kill the people beside the stele. From that, one could tell that attack was extremely powerful.<br>Yet, that stele was completely undamaged.<br>Seeing that, the crowd realized that it was impossible to use brute force to destroy the stele.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, take me as your master. I guarantee that I will impart the inheritance to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, I will ensure that you&rsquo;ll be able to leave this place safely.&rdquo;<br>Helpless, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted looked to Chu Feng again.<br>The only difference was that the tone of his voice had changed.<br>He was no longer speaking with a humble attitude.<br>This time around, there was a slightly threatening tone to his voice.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you cannot trust this Ghost-face. You should instead take this old man as your master. Only this old man could guarantee your safety.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Luo Tuo also spoke. Likewise, his tone was slightly threatening.<br>&ldquo;So the two of you have finally unmasked yourselves?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, with me here, neither of you can think about causing the slightest bit of harm to Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen shielded Chu Feng behind him.<br>&ldquo;Tang Chen, do not meddle in other&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;<br>The Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s clothes began to flutter. His oppressive might has been released.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, that Tang Chen is absolutely not a good person. You must not trust him. He&rsquo;s merely acting this way because he wanted to obtain the inheritance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should instead take me as your master. I am much more reliable compared to that hypocrite Tang Chen.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Luo Tuo also unleashed his oppressive might. It was pressing toward Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>These two people that were hostile and arguing with each other, these two people that were about to start fighting one another, actually joined hands again.<br>The reason for that was because they knew that they would have a much better odds of success in defeating Grandmaster Tang Chen by joining hands.<br>&ldquo;Two against one, isn&rsquo;t it a bit too unfair?&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, a powerful aura landed beside Grandmaster Tang Chen to also shield Chu Feng.<br>It was the Celestial Fairy Muzhi.<br>&ldquo;Muzhi, are you also planning to interfere in other people&rsquo;s business?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Luo Tuo and Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted with stern voices.<br>If the two of them were to take on Grandmaster Tang Chen, they would have high odds of success.<br>But, if Celestial Fairy Muzhi joined to assist Grandmaster Tang Chen, things would become thorny.<br>&ldquo;It is not too late to back out now,&rdquo; said Celestial Fairy Muzhi.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s already too late.&rdquo;<br>Right after Celestial Fairy Muzhi said those words, another voice sounded.<br>Once that voice was heard, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed.<br>The reason for that was because that voice does not belong to Grandmaster Tang Chen, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted or Grandmaster Luo Tuo.<br>Furthermore, that voice sounded from the sky above.<br>&ldquo;That is?!&rdquo;<br>Looking up, shock appeared in the crowd&rsquo;s eyes. They seemed completely horrified.<br>The reason for that was because the person standing in the sky was the incomparably ugly Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br></p></div>
