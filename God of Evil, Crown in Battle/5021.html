        <h1>Chapter 5020</h1>
        <div>: Revelation of Identity<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the first time Chu Feng saw such a panicked look on Shengguang Baimei&rsquo;s face, but he could understand the latter&rsquo;s reaction after listening to his explanation.<br>Even the Holy Monarch of the Holy Valley would be helpless against a sect that was considered a powerhouse in the entire world of cultivation.<br>&ldquo;Why would a power like the Pill Dao Immortal Sect come to our Nine Souls Galaxy? Does this mean that the imminent calamity of our Nine Souls Galaxy has something to do with the Pill Dao Immortal Sect?&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea murmured to herself.<br>&ldquo;Calamity? Elder, what calamity are you speaking of?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Even though the Lady of Dao Sea was speaking softly, it still caught Chu Feng and the others&rsquo; attention.<br>The Lady of Dao Sea thought that there was no point hiding the truth anymore, so she told them about how she had prophesied that a calamity would befall the Nine Souls Galaxy using the Spirit Rock of Prophecies.<br>There were different reactions from everyone after hearing her story.<br>Some fell into deep thoughts whereas others smiled helplessly.<br>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t prophecies usually unreliable? It seems awfully naive for a renowned world spiritist like you, the Lady of Dao Sea, to believe in such stuff,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei remarked.<br>&ldquo;I agree. I don&rsquo;t think that it would be wise to be so trusting of prophecies.&rdquo;<br>There were also others who agreed with Shengguang Baimei&rsquo;s point of view.<br>&ldquo;But rumor has it that prophecies shown by the Spirit Rock of Prophecies tend to be highly accurate, and the current circumstances surrounding our Nine Souls Galaxy do suggest an imminent calamity. If the Pill Dao Immortal Sect is really up to something, it&rsquo;ll likely spell a tragedy to our Nine Souls Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>There were also those who believed in the prophecy.<br>Given the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s power and influence, they could do whatever they like in the Nine Souls Galaxy and determine its fate.<br>&ldquo;How in the world did Sima Xiangtu get those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect to back him?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was much more concerned about Sima Xiangtu because the latter was simply too hateful. The latter&rsquo;s deed as Master Yin Ren was already enough to pique his killing intent, but it turned out that he was actually the dastardly Sima Xiangtu who backstabbed his master.<br>With that, it was no longer possible for Chu Feng to forgive Sima Xiangtu anymore. He was determined to kill the latter at all costs.<br>For that reason, he had to learn more about Sima Xiangtu.<br>As the saying went, &lsquo;know thyself and thy enemy, a hundred battles, a hundred victories&rsquo;.<br>Not to mention, Sima Xiangtu was proving to be a truly troublesome enemy.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you believe in prophecies?&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea suddenly asked.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I don&rsquo;t really believe in them,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;I see&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Lady of Dao Sea fell silent upon hearing those words.<br>Chu Feng sensed that there were some words lingering at the tip of her tongue, so he asked, &ldquo;Elder, is there something you wish to tell me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea replied with a shake of her head.<br>She was intending to tell Chu Feng that he was prophesied to be the one who would save the Nine Souls Galaxy from the calamity, but on second thought, it didn&rsquo;t seem meaningful to do so when Chu Feng himself didn&rsquo;t believe in prophecies.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, how did you convince the Netherworld Envoy to bring you back?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei asked.<br>They had seen how obstinate the Netherworld Envoy was, so it was unbelievable to them how the Netherworld Envoy had brought him back and was even helping him deal with Sima Xiangtu and the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.<br>Something special must have happened for the Netherworld Envoy to drastically change his mind.<br>&ldquo;This young hero over here, may I ask who is that man you have brought with you? He isn&rsquo;t a member of our Eastern Region, right?&rdquo;<br>A few other people also started questioning Chu Feng about the matter. They were all renowned experts in the Nine Souls Galaxy, but their attitude toward Chu Feng was respectful.<br>How could they not after learning that Chu Feng had a Half-God level cultivator accompanying him?<br>Boom!<br>Boom!<br>However, a series of ensuing explosions disrupted their conversation. The earth started to collapse inward, and lava started spurting out from underground.<br>It felt like this world was swiftly regressing to its most primitive form.<br>Chu Feng and the others were powerful cultivators in their own rights, but the battle that was ongoing above them left them feeling deeply pressured. That was the overwhelming might of Half-God level cultivators.<br>It was fortunate that those two Half-God cultivators were conscious about protecting them, so the shockwaves of their battles didn&rsquo;t reach them. Otherwise, a simple ripple from their blows would have been enough to obliterate their existence.<br>The term, Half-God, suggested the existence of divine power.<br>To ordinary civilians, a powerful cultivator was no different from god. Similarly, a Half-God cultivator was no different from a god to Martial Exalted level cultivators.<br>If the other party willed so, their lives could be forfeit.<br>Chu Feng stared at the sky intently because he sensed that the battle was getting to the climax. It shouldn&rsquo;t take long for the battle between the Netherworld Envoy and the expert from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect to come to an end.<br>And the conclusion of the battle would determine their fate.<br>In the sky, the Netherworld Envoy had raised his cultivation and whipped out two black scythes. Both of them were top-quality Exalted Armaments. He had wrapped himself inside a black aura, making him appear like a demon who had walked out of hell.<br>Yet, he was gasping for air. Bloodied wounds could be seen on his body. He was injured.<br>As for the middle-aged man from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, he held onto a silver compass in his left hand and a silver sword in his right. His white robe would flutter along with the wind, and there was a thin layer of golden light wrapping his body.<br>It looked as if the sun was embracing him. He gave off an air of righteousness, reminiscent of a dignified deity. There was not a wound to be found on him.<br>It was apparent who was in an advantageous position.<br>&ldquo;Why is the Pill Dao Immortal Sect interfering in the affairs of the Nine Souls Galaxy?&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy asked.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for our Pill Dao Immortal Sect to explain our actions to anyone,&rdquo; the middle-aged man from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect replied.<br>He was incredibly arrogant. Despite knowing that his opponent wasn&rsquo;t a pushover, he didn&rsquo;t seem to take the Netherworld Envoy seriously at all.<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t care less about your goals. I only made a move here because of Chu Feng. Would you let Chu Feng and his friends off for my sake?&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy asked.<br>&ldquo;Who do you think you are to ask such a request of me?&rdquo; the middle-aged man replied.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking who I am? Since you wish to know, I&rsquo;ll fulfill your curiosity.&rdquo;<br>The Netherworld Envoy wrapped his body in spirit power, causing the clothes he was wearing to change back to those of the Netherworld Sect.<br>&ldquo;I see. You&rsquo;re from the Netherworld Sect. The Netherworld Sect has gotten really nosey over the years.&rdquo;<br>However, a shocking sight occurred.<br>Even when the Netherworld Envoy had revealed his identity, the man from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect showed no signs of fear. On the contrary, he continued speaking in a snarky tone.<br></p></div>
