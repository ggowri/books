        <h1>Chapter 4939</h1>
        <div>: A Strong Opponent<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;My spirit power is beneath that of Brother Feiluan. I&rsquo;m at rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation. However, I have means that allow me to raise my spirit power to barely match that of rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritists,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;A rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist matching a rank five? What nonsense is that?&rdquo;<br>The crowd narrowed their eyes doubtfully upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, if you&rsquo;re at rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation, so be it. Why must you insist that you&rsquo;re at rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation? Are you saying that you have Heaven Defying Battle Power for spirit power too? If so, that would make you a prodigy amongst prodigies. I must say that I have never heard of anything like that before.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo;<br>That person&rsquo;s words were dripping with sarcasm, and he burst into laughter right after that. Many from the Zhuge Clan also laughed along with him.<br>Despite saying that Chu Feng was a prodigy, they were actually mocking him. They didn&rsquo;t think well of Chu Feng.<br>However, Chu Feng paid them no heed and instead turned to the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;May I know how do you intend the duel between me and Brother Feiluan to be?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;A world spiritist ought to have refined control over spirit power. The two of you will be competing in a pure clash of spirit power. You won&rsquo;t be allowed to use treasures or rely on external means. Summoning of world spirits will be forbidden too. It&rsquo;ll be a simple clash of spirit power,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;A world spiritist is named as such due to their ability to summon world spirits. I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t understand the rationale behind your suggested duel format. I&rsquo;ve long heard that Zhuge Feiluan is skilled in constructing formations but inept when it comes to world spirits, and that does seem to be the case now. Don&rsquo;t you think that you&rsquo;re blatantly tailoring the rules to suit Zhuge Feiluan?&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao asked.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, I am the one setting the rules here. Even if you&rsquo;re dissatisfied with my proposal, I won&rsquo;t change my mind. It&rsquo;s not too late for you to back out of the duel now,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Chu Feng had already known that the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was an unreasonable man, and he didn&rsquo;t want to bother wasting his breath arguing with him. It was impossible to reason with a man like that.<br>&ldquo;To prevent cheating, you must enter this treasure. This treasure will prevent you from using any treasures, thus ensuring the fairness of the duel,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said as he took out a transparent glass bowl.<br>He tossed the glass bowl onto the ground, but instead of shattering, the bowl began expanding by over ten thousandfold. A spirit formation gate formed at its perimeter.<br>The space within the bowl was actually much larger than what it appeared outside. Clearly, it was a spatial treasure.<br>Chu Feng entered the spirit formation gate to take a quick look before walking out.<br>The Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had mentioned beforehand that the usage of treasure was forbidden, but Chu Feng relied on his world spiritist bloodline and the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak to raise his spirit power.<br>The Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was considered a treasure too. If he couldn&rsquo;t use it in the glass bowl, there would be no reason to proceed ahead with the duel.<br>He would surely lose to Zhuge Feiluan.<br>However, to his relief, he found that he was still able to use the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak even inside the glass bowl. On top of that, judging from their expressions, the members of the Zhuge Clan didn&rsquo;t seem to have noticed anything when he walked out.<br>They weren&rsquo;t able to detect the use of his treasure.<br>&ldquo;How is it, young friend Chu Feng? Are you willing to accept this duel?&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>The Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief didn&rsquo;t declare the commencement of the duel right away. Instead, he turned to Princess Xiaoxiao and asked, &ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, what about you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng&rsquo;s will is my will,&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao replied.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, I&rsquo;ll reiterate what I mentioned earlier in case we aren&rsquo;t on the same page. If Chu Feng loses the duel&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Before the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief could finish his words, Princess Xiaoxiao interjected, &ldquo;Regardless of the results of the duel, the Divine Spirit Tree&rsquo;s Black Fruit will be yours. However, if Chu Feng wins the duel, I expect you to hold the end of your promise and allow Chu Feng in your legacy formation. If you dare renege on your promise once more, this will no longer just be an issue between you and Master Yin Ren.&rdquo;<br>There was a cold glint in Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s eyes as she said those words.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, our Zhuge Clan will uphold our promise!&rdquo;<br>The Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief shot Zhuge Feiluan a look.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, please.&rdquo;<br>Zhuge Feiluan first entered the spatial treasure, and Chu Feng followed him in.<br>Instead of making his move right away, Zhuge Feiluan asked, &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, should I give you some time to construct your formation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that. Let&rsquo;s begin the duel,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Guests first, Brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Zhuge Feiluan raised his hand and gestured for Chu Feng to go first. He was quite gentlemanly about it.<br>&ldquo;Pardon me.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng placed his palms together and formed a series of hand seals.<br>Boom!<br>Whoosh!<br>The earth quaked, and a tremendous surge of spirit power flooded out from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. It morphed into a gigantic dragon and rushed toward Zhuge Feiluan.<br>It looked lifelike, almost like a real dragon. Despite being solely made out of spirit power, its might was on par with Martial Exalted level cultivators.<br>&ldquo;This brat!&rdquo;<br>The relaxed members of the Zhuge Clan immediately stiffened up upon seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s moves. As skilled world spiritists themselves, they were able to discern Chu Feng&rsquo;s level of skill through his means.<br>Chu Feng had released a pure surge of spirit power without any additional processing. The fact that he could complete a formation so quickly showed the extreme degree of control he had over spirit power.<br>&ldquo;Formation barrier.&rdquo;<br>Zhuge Feiluan quickly formed a series of hand seals with a single hand waving at the sky.<br>Boom!<br>A powerful surge of spirit power flowed from his body, and it instantaneously morphed into a transparent barrier. It was reminiscent of a glass wall, and it formed a dome around Zhuge Feiluan, blocking attacks from all directions.<br>One would have to crush the barrier first in order to attack Zhuge Feiluan.<br>Bam!<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation dragon arrived before the barrier, but it didn&rsquo;t swing its claws at the barrier right away. Instead, it did a u-turn before opening its mouth wide.<br>Hu!<br>It released a powerful breath that carried greater destructive force than its physical might.<br>&ldquo;A formation within a formation. Amazing!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Buyu clapped his hand excitedly.<br>&ldquo;As expected of young hero Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei also broke into a radiant smile. He seemed to have forgotten his earlier displeasure.<br>However, his smile soon froze in place.<br>To his shock, the breath from the formation dragon wasn&rsquo;t damaging Zhuge Feiluan&rsquo;s barrier at all. Instead, the barrier was swiftly rushed toward Chu Feng, pressuring the latter.<br>Even the formation dragon was being pushed back by the barrier. It swung its claws furiously at the barrier, but it was unable to damage it in the least.<br>&ldquo;This is bad!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was appalled to learn that Zhuge Feiluan&rsquo;s spirit power and world spiritist techniques were stronger than he had expected. The latter was able to turn a simple barrier into a flexible tool for both attack and defense.<br>At this rate, his formation dragon was going to be shattered into pieces, and before long, e would fall in defeat.<br>Even though Chu Feng was able to raise his spirit power to a level comparable to rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritists through his means, he was still disadvantaged as most of his techniques were still stuck at rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>To make things worse, this was a duel of spirit power.<br>Most of the world spiritists he had previously encountered were less skilled than him, allowing him to deal with them easily. However, Zhuge Feiluan was a true prodigy.<br>He couldn&rsquo;t think of a way to deal with Zhuge Feiluan at all.<br>&ldquo;Am I going to fall in defeat here?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
