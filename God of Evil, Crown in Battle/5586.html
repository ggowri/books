        <h1>Chapter 5586: Above True God and True Dragon</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little Fishy quickly found Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big brother, where do you want to go?&rdquo; Little Fishy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I came here with a few friends from the Totem Dragon Clan. They might still be worried about me, so I&rsquo;m planning to head over and explain the situation to them first,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had mentioned the Totem Dragon Clan in case Little Fishy wanted to avoid them since he could already tell that she was planning to tag along with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for you here then, big brother. May I request that you avoid telling your friend that you are acquainted with me for the time being? I don&rsquo;t want others to know about my relationship with you. Actually, my father doesn&rsquo;t approve of me running about. I had to sneak out earlier, and the guards are still hot on my tail. I&rsquo;m worried that they might come after you if they find out about our relationship,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng headed over to the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s warship and informed them about what he had encountered in the Immemorial Star Sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a figure from the Ancient Era?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the elders turned grim upon learning about the events that had transpired in the Immemorial Star Sea. It was beyond their </span><span>imagination that someone could actually stow away the entire Immemorial Star Sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a doubt, that person posed a huge doubt to the galaxy overlords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, where&rsquo;s </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>? Where did she go?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;She has already left.&rdquo; Chu Feng lied about Little Fishy since he had already promised her not to divulge her whereabouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What a pity that I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to meet </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>,&rdquo; Long Chengyu lamented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a chance,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, we can be considered friends since we have fought alongside each other, right? You have to introduce her to me if a chance arises in the future! Let me witness the ravishing beauty of Her Highness </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>!&rdquo; Long Chengyu said with an expectant smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Definitely,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen proceeded to hold an urgent meeting to discuss the events of the Immemorial Star Sea. Both Jie Tian and Chaotic Era Scholar&rsquo;s appearances were huge matters to them, and they needed to take them seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng also learned that Long Chengyu and the others had assimilated their avatar armors with the assistance of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master, thus enhancing their bloodlines. However, they needed to quickly return to the Totem Dragon Clan to stabilize their bloodlines in order to benefit more from this fortuitous encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Chu Feng bade farewell to Long Chengyu and Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> before heading back to look for Little Fishy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A delighted smile blossomed on Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> face when she saw Chu Feng. Before they could say a word, a resplendent surge of spirit power suddenly covered the entire sky. Shortly after, the spirit power turned white like a sheet of paper, sealing off the surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gigantic words started to appear on the white sheet of paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prodigies are aplenty in this era, but a talented individual without guidance will not make it far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To grant more juniors the chance to grow and contribute to the world of cultivation, we will be opening the doors of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to outstanding world spiritists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any junior world spiritists of less than a hundred years of age may enter our Seven Realms Galaxy&rsquo;s Spring Upper Realm to register for our examination. Those who clear the examination will be accepted into our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. They will enjoy our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s protection and the best resources in the world of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one who gets first place in the examination will be conferred the title of our Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Rising Star, and they will be entitled to any of our Saint-rank treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Issuer of the edict: Jie </span><span>Tianran</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The announcement raised a commotion larger than the disappearance of the Immemorial Star Sea. It had been a hundred thousand years since the last time the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion openly recruited prodigies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion would still extend an invitation to outstanding world spiritists every now and then, but there were strict conditions that one would have to meet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, the individual must be a reputable world spiritist in the world of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second, the individual would have to clear an examination, and the examination spanned a duration of ten thousand years. It was only at the end of the ten thousand years that it would be determined whether they were qualified to join the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two harsh conditions resulted in very few world spiritists joining the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion in the past hundred thousand years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was now publicly recruiting outstanding world spiritists, and they were even using the Seven Realms Edict to announce that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Could it be that Jie Tian&rsquo;s defeat has led the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to realize that their juniors are too weak, so they have resorted to recruiting outsiders?&rdquo; Little Fishy teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That item is a treasure, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had noticed that the paper was so massive that the announcement was likely to not only span this realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the Seven Realms Edict, one of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s treasures. It allows messages to be publicly broadcasted within at least a galaxy, though it can reach even further if the one who activates it is powerful enough. I heard that the broadcast reached over five galaxies the last time it was used,&rdquo; Little Fishy said as she looked at Chu Feng in curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big brother, you seem more interested in the treasure than the content. Putting aside what the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is like as a power, there&rsquo;s no question that they have the best resources at their disposal. Aren&rsquo;t you interested as a world spiritist?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very interested,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, he just didn&rsquo;t want to become a member of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big brother, what plans do you have?&rdquo; Little Fishy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is there anywhere you would like to go?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little Fishy looked at Chu Feng with smiling crescent eyes and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go wherever big brother wants me to go.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You lass!&rdquo; Chu Feng was aware that Little Fishy had escaped from her guards to accompany him. &ldquo;You might face danger with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big brother, shouldn&rsquo;t you trust me even if you don&rsquo;t trust yourself?&rdquo; Little Fishy said as she shook her little fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng knew that Little Fishy wasn&rsquo;t just putting on an act. At the very least, she was far stronger than him at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, why don&rsquo;t you come to this place with me? Do you know where this is?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He drew out the map Chaotic Era Scholar had left for him. It had pointed out the destination, but there were no names except for a single line of text stating that the location was in the Heavenly Dome Galaxy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the exact realm, but I recognize the starfield. It&rsquo;s located at the Heavenly Dome Galaxy&rsquo;s Fighting Starfield. Big brother, have you heard of Fighting Starfield?&rdquo; Little Fishy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;A long time ago, a powerful monstrous beast clan known as the Fighting Ape Clan appeared in Fighting Starfield,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Fighting Ape Clan?&rdquo; This was the first time Chu Feng was hearing about that clan, but it sounded awfully familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud explosion suddenly echoed from the horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng quickly raised his head, only to be astonished to see waves of spirit power rippling from the Seven Realms Edict to spread far and wide. As a world spiritist, he could feel just how potent the power was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s starting to spread toward the other galaxies. The one who activated the Seven Realms Edict is the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master Jie </span><span>Tianran</span><span>, right? I wonder how many galaxies the message will reach,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Little Fishy, do you know how strong Jie </span><span>Tianran</span><span> is?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a pinnacle True Dragon World Spiritist. He&rsquo;s just a step away from reaching a Heavenly Dragon level,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Heavenly Dragon level? Is that what comes after True Dragon level?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Indeed. The world spiritist&rsquo;s Heavenly Dragon level corresponds to the cultivators&rsquo; Heavenly God level,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you know what comes after Heavenly Dragon level and Heavenly God level?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I heard that the strongest cultivators and world spiritists in the Ancient Era were at Heavenly God level and Heavenly Dragon level. No one then had surpassed that level. My father has a good chance of reaching Heavenly God level, though the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master has a good chance of reaching Heavenly Dragon level too,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is it safe to say that the zenith of the present world of cultivation is pinnacle True Dragon level and pinnacle True God level?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo; Little Fishy nodded, though she quickly added, &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a rumor.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What rumor?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It&rsquo;s said that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has a Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist, though no one has been able to verify that rumor to date,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Chu Feng fell into deep thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given that he was destined to challenge the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, it didn&rsquo;t bode well for him if the rumor turned out to be true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Seven Realms Edict had stopped rippling in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The broadcast has ended. Many people outside of this galaxy should have heard about the news. I just wonder how many galaxies it has reached,&rdquo; Little Fishy wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master was seated in a powerful formation. As soon as the formation dissipated, Jie Tian quickly rushed forward and asked, &ldquo;Grandfather, are you fine?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was worried because the complexion of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master looked awful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;s inevitable that I&rsquo;d be exhausted broadcasting the Seven Realms Edict to six galaxies,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Six galaxies?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jie Tian was both surprised and overjoyed. This meant that his grandfather had broken the previous record for the Seven Realms Edict&rsquo;s broadcast range, which indirectly showed how powerful his grandfather was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Tian&rsquo;er</span><span>, you head out first. I need to rest for a while,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;All right. Grandfather, you rest well. I&rsquo;ll be waiting right outside,&rdquo; Jie Tian said before heading out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master was satisfied to see how obedient Jie Tian was. He activated a formidable recovery formation contained in a crystal and sat down in it. To enhance the effects of the recovery formation, he even took off his robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body had defined muscles even though he was an elder, but there was a wound on his left chest that was attention-grabbing. It was an old sword wound, but it hadn&rsquo;t healed to this date.</span></p></div>
