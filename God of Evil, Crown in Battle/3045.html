        <div> - Seeking The Sacred Ground<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;According to the description provided by Mingchao and Xunyi, that place is indeed the location where the Abyss Elf Clan lived in the past, the Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground. That said, while a lot of people have seen it before, no one has ever managed to enter it. I truly never expected that Mingchao and Xunyi would be able to enter it.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Youyuan looked to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, since you&rsquo;d also been sucked into a vortex, did you not encounter anything?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng hesitated slightly. However, after thinking about all that Chu Youyuan had done for him, Chu Feng decided to trust Chu Youyuan and tell him the truth.<br>&ldquo;This junior entered the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You actually entered the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain?&rdquo; Chu Youyuan was very surprised upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;However, as the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain was too dangerous, I left it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Unbelievable,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s eyes were filled with surprise.<br>&ldquo;I also have a close friend by the name of Wang Qiang. He is that person who has appeared in the Void Sacred Tree. He even carved words on the Void Sacred Tree,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such a thing&hellip;&rdquo; The astonishment in Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s eyes grew even stronger upon hearing those words. Then, he started to contemplate.<br>After a short while, he slowly said, &ldquo;Vortexes are generally very rarely seen in the Stairway to Heaven. Even if vortexes are to appear, they will not possess that sort of power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The vortexes that you all encountered were most definitely no ordinary vortexes,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan said with a very determined tone.<br>Actually, even without Chu Youyuan saying it, Chu Feng already guessed that to be the case.<br>He felt that it was possible that someone was helping them from the shadows. Otherwise, there wouldn&rsquo;t be such a coincidence where all of them were sent to locations in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm where not even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were able to enter<br>Merely, what sort of person would possess such power to know all of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s legendary remnants like the back of their hand? Furthermore, that person was even able to send people into those remnants at will.<br>One must know that those were things that not even the Chu Heavenly Clan was capable of doing.<br>After being silent for a while, Chu Youyuan asked Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi, &ldquo;Do you two still remember the location of that ravine?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi said in unison.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go there right away,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan said.<br>Then, the four of them proceeded toward the location of the ravine according to Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi&rsquo;s memories.<br>Actually, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi were very unfamiliar with the topography of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>However, Chu Youyuan knew the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s topography very well. Thus, as long as they provided with him clues, Chu Youyuan was able to immediately determine the location they were talking about.<br>Thus, their journey there was very smooth.<br>Furthermore, with an expert like Chu Youyuan leading them, their speed was extremely fast.<br>In merely a short few days, they arrived at a plain.<br>It was a plain with no sign of human habitation. One could totally describe it as wild.<br>&ldquo;Is this the place?&rdquo; Chu Youyuan asked.<br>&ldquo;This is it, this is the place,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said with certainty.<br>Then, he pointed ahead, &ldquo;When we left that place, we came out from there. Upon leaving, we were unable to find a way back. The reason for that is because there is simply no trace of the ravine there at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only natural for you all to not be able to find it. After all, that&rsquo;s the Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground we&rsquo;re talking about here,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let us search for it together. That said, do not have too much hope. After all, that Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground is ever-moving to begin with.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It might be possible that it is no longer on this plain now,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded. Then, he activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes and began to examine the plain.<br>Upon inspecting the area, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes immediately started shining. Under his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to see a subtle change.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over there,&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly turned around and pointed to a direction behind them.<br>At the same time as Chu Feng spoke, Chu Youyuan actually also spoke.<br>It would appear that Chu Youyuan, that Dragon Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist, possessed an extremely powerful observational ability as well. At the very least, it was not at all inferior to Chu Feng&rsquo;s current Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>Moreover, it was not only Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s observational ability that was strong; his speed was also much faster than Chu Feng&rsquo;s. At practically the very moment he discovered the abnormality, he immediately arrived at that location and began to set up a formation.<br>As for Chu Feng, he also arrived beside Chu Youyuan.<br>Seeing this, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi hurriedly rushed over.<br>However, compared to the joyous expressions on Chu Feng and Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s faces, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi were puzzled.<br>The reason for that was because what was before them was clearly a grassland. They simply saw no trace of the so-called Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Youyuan finished setting up his formation.<br>His formation was not very large. It resembled a mirror. Should one look through the mirror, one would discover that the location ahead had changed.<br>On the other side of the mirror was no longer an ordinary plain. Instead, it was a vast ravine.<br>The ravine was so vast that one simply could not see its borders. It looked like an isolated world.<br>Exotic plants filled the ravine. If the place they were at was the mortal world, then the ravine would be a paradise, a world of immortals.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, it is the Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for me witnessing it myself, even this old man would not dare to believe that the Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground truly exists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mingchao, Xunyi, this is all thanks to the two of you,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan was very happy. He was extremely excited upon seeing the scene before him.<br>One had to know that this was the first time Chu Youyuan had seen the legendary Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground.<br>After that, Chu Youyuan extended his hand to attempt to enter the Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground.<br>However, as his hand approached the Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground, he was blocked by an invisible barrier.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, we can&rsquo;t enter it,&rdquo; Seeing this, Chu Feng and the others were slightly startled.<br>They were certain that it was not that easy to enter the Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground.<br>However, upon realizing this, they felt somewhat dispirited.<br>If they weren't able to enter it, what use was there in finding it?<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, let this old man have a try,&rdquo; Right at that moment, Chu Youyuan waved his sleeve. Immediately, boundless spirit power burst out of his body.<br>Chu Youyuan was setting up a formation.<br><br><br></p></div>
