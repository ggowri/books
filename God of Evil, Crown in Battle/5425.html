        <h1>Chapter 5425: Proving Our Strength Through Actions</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Yunqing, you have reached Purple Dragon God-cloak?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle was astonished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was well aware that Bai Yunqing was only at Blue Dragon God-cloak when he last left, and he shouldn&rsquo;t have been anywhere close to making a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Senior uncle, it&rsquo;s all thanks to big brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s help that I was able to make a breakthrough so quickly,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing replied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng helped you?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle looked at Chu Feng with conflicting emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Tsk! It&rsquo;s no wonder you dare to run your mouth. Turns out that you made a breakthrough. Still, just because your spirit power is at the same level doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re on par with him. Do you honestly think that you&rsquo;re better than the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s young master Ling Hang?&rdquo; Li Ta&rsquo;er scoffed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While she was surprised by Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s breakthrough, she remained certain that Bai Yunqing was inferior to Ling Hang.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Miss Li, are you implying that Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s master is weak?&rdquo; Chu Feng finally spoke up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;What do you mean by that? Are you trying to drive a wedge between us?&rdquo; Li Ta&rsquo;er roared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Drive a wedge? Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s master is a renowned world spiritist too, but you kept scorning Bai Yunqing. Isn&rsquo;t that the same thing too?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I mean. Don&rsquo;t you talk rubbish!&rdquo; Li Ta&rsquo;er argued.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, Ta&rsquo;er might be tactless with her words, but she doesn&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle interjected.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them appeared to be rather afraid of Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s master, or at the very least, neither of them wanted to be seen looking down on Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s master.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Brother Bai, you mentioned earlier that it was thanks to Brother Chu that you were able to reach Purple Dragon God-cloak. That must mean that Brother Chu is stronger than the two of us. Since that&rsquo;s the case, why don&rsquo;t the three of us work together to perfect this formation?&rdquo; Ling Hang offered with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;My thoughts exactly,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said. &ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s do it together.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was planning to offer Bai Yunqing some pointers to perfect the formation by himself, but he already had enough of Ling Hang&rsquo;s hypocritical attitude.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For instance, the fact that Ling Hang knew their names and the content of their conversation showed that he had been paying attention to them, but he chose to turn a blind eye to them till Bai Yunqing said those words. That showed that the only thing he was concerned about was someone doubting his capability.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, it was likely that his invitation to Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing was a trap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; Ling Hang suddenly interjected while Chu Feng was making his way toward the formation. &ldquo;I forgot to ask you, young master Chu Feng. What&rsquo;s your current spirit power? Brother Bai and I will assist you if you have reached Purple Dragon God-cloak.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ling Hang was trying to mock Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power. The rumors he had heard about Chu Feng after arriving at the Totem Galaxy led him to think that Chu Feng was a powerful cultivator but a weak world spiritist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;My big brother Chu Feng is at Blue Dragon God-cloak,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Blue Dragon God-cloak?&rdquo; Ling Hang was taken aback, but he quickly continued, &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng is indeed incredible, but I&rsquo;m worried that your spirit power isn&rsquo;t enough to perfect the formation.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Rest assured, young master Ling. My big brother Chu Feng might only be at Blue Dragon God-cloak, but the formations he constructs are comparable to that of a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing replied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Ling Hang laughed, but it was dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Bai Yunqing, are you out of your mind? Even if you want to compliment your big brother, there should be a limit to your bragging. How can a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist construct a formation comparable to a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist? Do you take us for fools?&rdquo; Li Ta&rsquo;er bellowed without the slightest hint of respect, almost as if Bai Yunqing was her servant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bai Yunqing wasn&rsquo;t one to shy away from conflict. He didn&rsquo;t show any fear toward Ling Hang, but for some reason, he didn&rsquo;t snap back at Li Ta&rsquo;er&rsquo;s criticism.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Are you a world spiritist too?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Of course. I might be weaker than young master Ling Hang, but I am a Gray Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo; To prove her own strength, Li Ta&rsquo;er released a whiff of her spirit power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re a world spiritist, allow me to pose a question to you. Do you think that it&rsquo;s possible for a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist like me to wield fighting prowess comparable to a rank four Half-God level cultivator?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;You brothers sure know to brag. Bai Yunqing said that your formations are comparable to a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, whereas you&rsquo;re claiming that your fighting prowess is on par with rank four Half-God level cultivators. Everyone knows that Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists are equivalent to rank three Half-God level cultivators. Why would you be an exception to the rule? Do you take yourself for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Ling Xiao?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All of a sudden, Chu Feng released his spirit power and constructed a slaughter formation to attack Li Ta&rsquo;er. A figure immediately appeared in front of Li Ta&rsquo;er to stop the slaughter formation. It was Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, what do you mean by this?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle asked with a voice tinged with rage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Surprisingly, the arrogant Li Ta&rsquo;er had fallen completely silent. She stared at Chu Feng in disbelief, as if she couldn&rsquo;t believe that the latter had just made a move on her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, I don&rsquo;t intend to hurt your daughter. I just wanted to dispel her misunderstandings of me. Elder, would you mind telling everyone how strong my earlier formation was?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation is indeed comparable to rank four Half-God level cultivators. How rare it is for a God-cloak World Spiritist to possess heaven-</span><span>defying battle power!&rdquo; As soon as Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle finally calmed down, he began complimenting Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Ling Hang&rsquo;s face soured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;I just wanted to prove to your daughter that I wasn&rsquo;t lying. Similarly, I&rsquo;ll prove right now that my brother isn&rsquo;t lying either.&rdquo; Chu Feng walked up to the formation and asked Ling Hang, &ldquo;Young master Ling, are you going to assist me?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng is indeed formidable. I am in awe. I don&rsquo;t think that there are many world spiritists out there who can match your talent. However, young master Chu Feng, are you certain that you can construct a formation comparable to that of Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists?&rdquo; Ling Hang posed his doubt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead of arguing with Ling Hang, Chu Feng proceeded to construct a formation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd was taken aback. They weren&rsquo;t able to fully ascertain it, but the formation Chu Feng was constructing did appear to be comparable to a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. While the formation didn&rsquo;t wield any offensive ability, it was nevertheless a formidable feat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Chu Feng&rsquo;s efforts, it didn&rsquo;t take long for the formation to light up.</span></p></div>
