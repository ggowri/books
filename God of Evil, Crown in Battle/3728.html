        <div> - Exalted Taboo Martial Skill<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m grateful for your kind intentions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you&rsquo;re unable to help me. You should instead quickly nurse yourself back to health, and continue establishing a space in your soul,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I&rsquo;m in no rush. Please nurse your health first. I will continue with establishing a space in my soul after you&rsquo;re healthy again,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Are you certain that you&rsquo;re in no rush?&rdquo; asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Linghu Hongfei has already canceled his battle appointment against me. With that, I have no need to rush. I will go and find him to avenge Lingxi after I have fused with my Divine Power,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Boy, you were deceived by them," said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Deceived?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, what do you mean by that?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze immediately changed upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;This old man has a rough idea of your current situation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Linghu Hongfei has not canceled the appointment against you in three months.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That appointment is still valid.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only that, but the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield has already changed hands. Currently, the overlord is none other than the Linghu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;The Wuming Clan has been defeated by the Linghu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; A shocked expression appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;Mn. Apart from a small amount of experts that managed to flee, the rest of the Wuming Clan have all been killed," said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;The Linghu Heavenly Clan actually has such strength?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt even more astonished.<br>Although he knew that the Linghu Heavenly Clan must possess a certain amount of strength, seeing that they dared to wage war against the Wuming Clan, he did not expect the war for the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s overlord status to end so quickly.<br>Evidently, the Linghu Heavenly Clan was much more powerful than he had imagined.<br>&ldquo;But, why would they deceive me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that Lingxi wants to take on Linghu Hongfei by herself?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That shouldn&rsquo;t be it. They&rsquo;re afraid that you&rsquo;ll be in danger.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because they actually received two pieces of information.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Apart from the information of the Linghu Heavenly Clan obtaining the Starfield Master Realm&rsquo;s overlord status, the other piece of information was related to you and Linghu Hongfei," said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Senior, exactly what is that second piece of information?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You should know about Exalted Heavenly Fate, right? I&rsquo;ve heard that he was the one who prophesied the predestined battle between you and Linghu Hongfei,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Thus, the second piece of information is related to Exalted Heavenly Fate?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Correct. Exalted Heavenly Fate had made another prophecy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This time around, he prophesied the outcome of the battle between you and Linghu Hongfei,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze turned serious. He asked, &ldquo;What is the outcome?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You will die,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Die?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart tensed up upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Not only will you be defeated in the battle, but you will also be killed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exalted Heavenly Fate&rsquo;s prophecies all come to fruition. All these years, never has he made a mistake in his prophecy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is precisely because of that prophecy that Chu Lingxi, Gu Mingyuan, Chu Xuanzhengfa and even Grandmaster Liangqiu decide to join hands in deceiving you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you notice that there was spirit power flowing throughout all of their bodies? That was Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s trick.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He knows that you&rsquo;re a Saint-cloak World Spiritist and possesses sharp perception. Fearing that Chu Lingxi and the others&rsquo; lies would be detected by you, he deliberately set up a spirit formation on their bodies so that they could deceive you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, they are doing all this for your sake.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I feel that you should know the truth,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for telling me the truth, senior.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng felt truly grateful towards the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Although Chu Lingxi and others had deceived him for his own good, he knew what they would be confronted with.<br>They would no longer simply be facing the Linghu Heavenly Clan. Instead, they would be facing the strongest power in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>As for Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s opponent, he was someone that even Exalted Heavenly Fate prophesied that Chu Feng could not defeat.<br>It was impossible for Chu Feng to allow Chu Lingxi and the Chu Heavenly Clansmen to confront all of that.<br>Even though he knew that the battle was extremely dangerous, he still had to go.<br>&ldquo;Thus, you&rsquo;ve decided to keep the appointment?&rdquo; asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Mn.&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still planning to go even though you know that you&rsquo;ll die?&rdquo; asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Die? How could one be so certain that I&rsquo;ll die?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Exalted Heavenly Fate&rsquo;s prophecies have never been wrong,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;In that case, it would mean that his prophecy will be wrong for the first time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, do not even care about my life. Thus, how could I care about a mere prophecy from that Exalted Heavenly Fate?&rdquo; A cold smile appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Boy, you have courage.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Take out your Fire Qilin Talisman. This old man will help you fuse with it.&rdquo;<br>As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke, he suddenly stood up, put on his clothes and extended his hand towards Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, your injuries are still&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng wanted to refuse. After all, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was still extremely weak.<br>&ldquo;Injuries? You&rsquo;ve seen the injuries on my body. Compared to those injuries, my current injuries are nothing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are not only carrying your own reputation right now. You are also carrying the reputation of your father and your grandfather.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, you can refuse to go to keep the appointment. But, if you are to go, you must return from the battle victorious, and show the people of the world your talents and capability.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a man, do not act so long-winded. Hand me that Fire Qilin Talisman,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist urged Chu Feng.<br>Seeing that he was unable to make the Ox-nosed Old Daoist change his mind, Chu Feng took out the Fire Qilin Talisman.<br>That said, he did not only take out the Fire Qilin Talisman. He also took out a scroll.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you possess remarkable abilities. Why don&rsquo;t you help me have a look at this and determine what the contents of this scroll are?&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>That scroll was something that his father had brought back from the Greenfield Upper Realm&rsquo;s Demon Prison Valley.<br>As for the Demon Prison Valley, it was once an Eccentric&rsquo;s Remnant of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Chu Feng had tried opening the scroll before. However, he was simply unable to open it.<br>That said, Chu Feng felt that the scroll was an extraordinary item.<br>Originally, Chu Feng was planning to rely on himself to open the scroll. After all, it was something from his father. He wanted to use his own power to open it.<br>However, the current situation looked extremely bad. Although Chu Feng had said he was not afraid of the Linghu Heavenly Clan, he didn&rsquo;t know if he would be able to return from this battle alive.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng wanted to draw support from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and open the scroll.<br>&ldquo;Allow this old man to have a look.&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist took the scroll from Chu Feng. After inspecting it, he shook his head.<br>&ldquo;If this old man has guessed correctly, within this scroll should be an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill!!!&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br></p></div>
