        <h1>Chapter 5560: Confirmed Betrayal</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>As the two of them ventured into the depths of the underground palace and passed through another gate, Chu Feng finally came face to face with the source of the evil power.</span><br><span>It was a pool of black water that bubbled like lava.</span><br><span>Chu Feng could tell that the pool of black water was just a portion of the evil power; it wasn&rsquo;t the evil power&rsquo;s core. While it possessed special powers, it wasn&rsquo;t particularly frightening. The real evil power was bound to be even more frightening.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Go in,&rdquo; Jie Tian ordered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? &ldquo;Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking the obvious. Can&rsquo;t you feel it yourself?&rdquo; Jie Tian asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&hellip; betrayed us?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>With a sinister smile, Jie Tian raised his palm and manifested the imprint on it, saying, &ldquo;Do you want to live or not?&rdquo;</span><br><span>That threat was meaningless since the poison pill didn&rsquo;t work on Chu Feng, but Chu Feng still did as he was told.</span><br><span>Whoosh!</span><br><span>The black water furiously bubbled upon Chu Feng&rsquo;s entry. He could feel a peculiar surge of energy latching onto him.</span><br><span>Swoosh!</span><br><span>With a wave of his sleeves, Jie Tian constructed a sealing formation around the pool, locking Chu Feng in together with it. Following that, he turned around and left without saying a word.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that fellow up to?&rdquo; Eggy was displeased.</span><br><span>She couldn&rsquo;t stand how arrogantly Jie Tian was behaving before Chu Feng. It made her want to give him a slap so tight that his head was twisted off his neck.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He probably wants me to enter the Star Memorial Domain with him,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is this pool the reason the defectors are able to enter the Star Memorial Domain?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good thing. Did that fellow really turn on the Star Sea Realm? What did the evil power promise him in return? It&rsquo;s not as if he&rsquo;s a native in this realm, so there&rsquo;s no need for him to get involved in this battle,&rdquo; Eggy murmured in confusion.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I reckon the evil power is after the secret or power lying in the Star Memorial Domain. I reckon that the evil power must have promised Jie Tian some kind of benefit related to that, and that&rsquo;s not something that the other formation entities are able to provide him,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that Little Fishy is in danger?&rdquo; Eggy asked worriedly.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Likely so. Little Fishy wouldn&rsquo;t turn a blind eye to Jie Tian&rsquo;s actions. Jie Tian probably sees her as a thorn in his side. That challenge might be a way for him to test Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> strength,&rdquo; Chu Feng analyzed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That fellow sure is underhanded!&rdquo; Eggy exclaimed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m here. His schemes won&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng could have finished the tempering within two hours, but Jie Tian only returned the following day. He first examined Chu Feng from head to toe before freeing him from the barrier.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Finally a useful one. Let me open your eyes.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Tian waved his sleeves, and eighteen black formation armors charged forth.</span><br><span>These formation armors were similar in stature, standing at thirty meters tall, though they wielded different weapons, ranging from sabers, spears, swords, halberds, axes, and hooks to forks. They emanated energy comparable to Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> formation armor. Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> formation armor wouldn&rsquo;t be a match for the eighteen of them if they teamed up together.</span><br><span>However, these eighteen formation armors were without masters, indicating that these weren&rsquo;t the formation armors Jie Tian usually used. There was no doubt that Jie Tian&rsquo;s formation armor was even stronger than these.</span><br><span>Little Fishy would be in great danger if Jie Tian planned to make a move on her.</span><br><span>Jie Tian waved his sleeves, and a formation blueprint appeared. &ldquo;Try activating the formation armors with this formation. The more you can activate, the better it is.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng did as he was told.</span><br><span>It didn&rsquo;t take him much effort to control the first formation armor, but he quickly realized that the formation armor, despite looking formidable on the surface, was incomplete and couldn&rsquo;t exert its full prowess.</span><br><span>This was good news.</span><br><span>Chu Feng moved on to activate the second formation armor, but his expression started to strain. There was a deep frown on his face when he proceeded to the third formation armor. By the fourth formation armor, he had already reached his limit.</span><br><span>As a result, he failed to activate the fifth formation armor.</span><br><span>Of course, this was an act from Chu Feng. He had the ability to control all eighteen formation armors. He was only feigning weakness because Jie Tian was keeping a close eye on him. He noticed a hint of apprehension in Jie Tian&rsquo;s eyes when he activated the first formation armor.</span><br><span>Clearly, Jie Tian hadn&rsquo;t expected Chu Feng to activate the first formation armor with ease. Thus, Chu Feng made sure to struggle with the second, and Jie Tian&rsquo;s apprehension finally faded.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is this your limit? I guess you&rsquo;re a formation entity, after all,&rdquo; Jie Tian remarked with a shake of his head.</span><br><span>He began activating the formation armors by himself. He was actually able to activate all eighteen, though it clearly took a toll on him. He had to strain himself so much that it was impossible for him to draw out the full prowess of the formation armors.</span><br><span>After putting on the display, Jie Tian told Chu Feng, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a day to practice. It&rsquo;s only a pass if you&rsquo;re able to control at least five formation armor.&rdquo;</span><br><span>With those words, he took his leave.</span><br><span>Chu Feng examined the eighteen formation armors.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What is he acting smug for? He obviously struggled to control the eighteen formation armors!&rdquo; Eggy grumbled in annoyance,</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason he needs me. He wants me to help him share the burden of five formation armors,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hilarious. He doesn&rsquo;t trust you, yet he still wants to entrust these formation armors to you,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s overconfidence for you. He believes in his judgment. He thinks that I don&rsquo;t have the ability to tamper with the formation armors. Little does he know that he&rsquo;s providing me with a golden opportunity here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br></p></div>
