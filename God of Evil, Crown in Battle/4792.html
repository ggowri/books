        <h1>Chapter 4791</h1>
        <div>: Milord<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the ray of light fell upon Zuoqiu Youyu&rsquo;s body, the giant monster finally closed its mouth, turned around, and left in the direction where it came from, leaving just the monstrous elder&rsquo;s voice echoing in the surroundings.<br>&ldquo;The man of great talents, please do not let my Milord down.&rdquo;<br>Those words weren&rsquo;t particularly loud, but they seemed to echo right within the hearts of the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Milord? That elder possesses such terrifying powers, so what kind of incredible figure could his lord be? Why would there be such an existence in the Yinyang Withered Well Realm?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of this from the predecessors!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could there really be other lifeforms in the Yinyang Withered Well Realm?&rdquo;<br>The disciples discussed fervently amongst themselves.<br>The clues dropped by the monstrous elder hinted at several terrifying possibilities.<br>If there were only doubts that there were other existences in the Yinyang Withered Well Realm, the monstrous elder&rsquo;s words effectively verified those claims. To make things worse, these existences appeared to be far more formidable than they had expected.<br>Putting all things aside, just the monstrous elder they met earlier was already an unfathomable expert. If so, the &lsquo;Milord&rsquo; he mentioned was likely to be even more terrifying.<br>If such existences were to leave the Yinyang Withered Well Realm, could the current Hidden Dragon Martial Sect really be able to stop them?<br>The disciples suddenly felt an impending sense of danger.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, is that person really not the manifestation of the formation but a real person?&rdquo; Xia Yan asked.<br>She initially thought that the giant and the monstrous elder were beings created by the formation, but they appeared so real that she couldn&rsquo;t help but think twice about it.<br>Unable to confirm the matter, she could only turn to Chu Feng for clarification.<br>&ldquo;I guess so.&rdquo;<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s response was a little perfunctory. His eyes were focused on Zuoqiu Youyu, such that he didn&rsquo;t even turn to look at Xia Yan while answering the question.<br>Or to be more exact, he was focused on the light shrouding Zuoqiu Youyu&rsquo;s body.<br>&ldquo;Oh? Chu Feng seems to be concerned about that matter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could he possibly not be? After breaking Lord Dugu Lingtian&rsquo;s record so many times, he must have thought that he is the prodigy the elder spoke of earlier, only to realize that it was referring to Zuoqiu Youyu instead. He must be feeling horrible at the moment.&rdquo;<br>The disciples gossiped.<br>Hearing those words, Xia Yan made a comparison between the light shining on the two of them once more. They were indeed far brighter than the rest of the crowd, but Zuoqiu Yanyu&rsquo;s was visibly brighter than that of Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>&ldquo;Could there be a mistake here?&rdquo; Xia Yan murmured.<br>&ldquo;Xia Yan, what do you mean by that?&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Youyu didn&rsquo;t speak a word, but Zuoqiu Yanliang had already spoken up in displeasure.<br>&ldquo;A criminal like you should know his place. Was it enough for you to force the other disciples to do your bidding, so you&rsquo;re intending to control my mouth now too? Who do you think you are? The vice sectmaster?&rdquo;<br>Even though Xia Yan was weaker than Zuoqiu Yanliang, she didn&rsquo;t fear the latter at all. In fact, she didn&rsquo;t hesitate to mention Zuoqiu Yanliang&rsquo;s grandfather when insulting him.<br>This was the first time Chu Feng had seen a disciple daring to speak to Zuoqiu Yanliang in such a manner. Yet, Zuoqiu Yanliang couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it at all. He could only glare at Xia Yan lividly.<br>It was at this moment that Zuoqiu Youyu finally spoke up.<br>&ldquo;Xia Yan, you&rsquo;re born with a golden spoon in your mouth, and you&rsquo;re blessed with great talents too. Someone like you should be careful when choosing your friends.&rdquo;<br>It was clear that he was referring to Chu Feng through his words.<br>&ldquo;Senior Zuoqiu, you have my gratitude for your concern. However, I believe that it&rsquo;s none of your business whom I befriend?&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan spoke those words with a bright smile on her lips, but the hostility in her voice was clear.<br>&ldquo;I wish you all the best.&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Youyu didn&rsquo;t want to bother arguing with Xia Yan, so he rose into the air to leave the area.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment.&rdquo;<br>However, Chu Feng suddenly called him out.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Zuoqiu Youyu asked.<br>&ldquo;Ah, never mind,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied before turning his gaze toward Zuoqiu Yanliang.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what are you up to?&rdquo; Zuoqiu Yanliang asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not up to anything. Just some words of advice from me, it&rsquo;ll be best for you to stay put,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with that fellow? Was he triggered or something?&rdquo;<br>The other disciples were perplexed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s peculiar behavior.<br>As for Zuoqiu Youyu, he shot a glance at Chu Feng before leaving the area. He didn&rsquo;t bring Song Qian together with him.<br>By this point, the crowd had already realized that they could remove the Yinyang Shackles once they were out of the spirit formation passageway and move freely.<br>Shortly after Zuoqiu Youyu left, Zuoqiu Yanliang also began to take his leave too.<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to stay put?&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly spoke up.<br>This time around, he spoke with a tone that was reminiscent of a command.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Yanliang&rsquo;s complexion turned awful, but he dared not to disobey Chu Feng&rsquo;s command. In truth, everyone knew what he was afraid of.<br>Chu Feng had obtained the power of the Hellking in the Vicious Beast Hellworld, and he even killed a couple of personal disciples before the crowd just a few days ago.<br>Zuoqiu Yanliang and Song Qian also had a portion of the Hellking&rsquo;s powers imbued in their bodies, so their lives were in Chu Feng&rsquo;s grasp. As long as Chu Feng willed it so, he could take both of their lives whenever he wished.<br>Of course, Chu Feng himself knew that he wasn&rsquo;t in possession of the Hellking&rsquo;s power, but the latter didn&rsquo;t know of this.<br>This was also the reason why Zuoqiu Yanliang was so frightened of Chu Feng.<br>Boom!<br>All of a sudden, a powerful force smashed down from the sky onto where Chu Feng was standing. It stirred powerful shockwaves that forced Xia Yan and the others standing next to Chu Feng to retreat.<br>All that was left in Chu Feng&rsquo;s wake was a crater. Chu Feng&rsquo;s body had vanished entirely, leaving behind just a small tinge of his aura.<br>It was an attack from a Martial Exalted level cultivator.<br>&ldquo;Zuoqiu Youyu, how dare you assassinate Chu Feng? I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo; Xia Yan howled furiously.<br>Her face warped in agitation as she glared at Zuoqiu Youyu with seething hatred.<br>Her roar snapped the crowd out of their daze.<br>Someone had assaulted Chu Feng, and the most likely suspect was no other than Zuoqiu Youyu. But what was queer about the situation was that Chu Feng had completely vanished from sight, not even leaving a droplet of blood behind.<br>They couldn&rsquo;t tell if Chu Feng was really dead or not.<br></p></div>
