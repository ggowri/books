        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Shoosh!</span><br><span>Chu Feng suddenly waved his sleeves, and numerous streaks of light flew out and </span><span>landed in front of Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> and every Totem Phoenix Clansmen. &ldquo;This is a cultivation skill. Familiarize yourself with it. We&rsquo;ll need it later.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Without any hesitation, Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> took the light bundle into her head. Feng </span><span>Jiuyue</span><span> and Feng </span><span>Tiansheng</span><span> followed suit. Seeing that, the remaining Totem Phoenix Clansmen did the same as well.</span><br><span>It didn&rsquo;t take long for Chu Feng to return to where Long Chengyu and the others were.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How is it? Did you manage to grasp the cultivation skill?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the crowd.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I managed to grasp it, but&hellip;&rdquo; Long Chengyu glanced at the clansmen behind him, who, except Long </span><span>Yuhong</span><span> and Long Zhizhi, immediately lowered their heads.</span><br><span>Long </span><span>Fulai</span><span> awkwardly scratched his head and said, &ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, your cultivation skill is too hard! I need more time to grasp it.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng turned to the Totem Phoenix Clan. Feng </span><span>Jiuyue</span><span> and Feng </span><span>Tiansheng</span><span> had grasped the cultivation skill, but the others, just like Long </span><span>Fulai</span><span>, were unable to grasp the cultivation skill too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have much time left. The formation core is going to appear soon, and the Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clansmen will be here in no time once that happens,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What do we do?!&rdquo; Both the Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen panicked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, there&rsquo;s another way out. However, I&rsquo;ll need you to cooperate with me.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng began constructing a formation with a lot of formation cores&mdash;there were exactly enough formation cores for everyone present. Following that, he released his red lightning aura and infused it into the formation cores.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Everyone except for Brother Chengyu, enter a formation core. Trust me and don&rsquo;t resist my power,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>The crowd did as they were told.</span><br><span>Chu Feng sat down and channeled the formation. Within moments, some of the Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen&rsquo;s avatar armor began glowing with a mysterious light, but not everyone enjoyed the same reaction.</span><br><span>It was then that a furious howl echoed, &ldquo;Put down your guard and accept my energy. Can&rsquo;t you do something as easy as that?&rdquo;</span><br><span>It was Chu Feng. From his perspective, the cultivation skill he had imparted to the crowd was already condensed to the bare minimum, to the point where it couldn&rsquo;t be any simpler, but the majority of those present were still unable to grasp it.</span><br><span>Left with no choice, he tried to control everything by himself. All the crowd had to do was to put down their guard and let him channel the formation&rsquo;s energy to induce a resonation amongst them avatar armor and bloodlines. As long as the crowd opened themselves up to him, there shouldn&rsquo;t be any obstruction.</span><br><span>Yet, most people were resisting him. To put it bluntly, they didn&rsquo;t trust him enough to leave themselves vulnerable to him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Totem Phoenix Clansmen, put down your guard!&rdquo; Feng </span><span>Jiuyue</span><span> roared.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Totem Dragon Clansmen, do you need me to say the unnecessary? Are you unable to </span><span>trust Brother Chu Feng?&rdquo; Long Chengyu bellowed.</span><br><span>After the two of them made their stances clear, there was a stark increase in the number of glowing avatar armor. Chu Feng had used the formation&rsquo;s energy to link their avatar armor to their bloodline power. That was the only way to truly help them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll hurt a little, but please hold on. Your lives are at stake here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said. He turned to Long Chengyu and asked, &ldquo;Brother Chengyu, are you ready?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Chengyu knew the effects of Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation. It was a formation that took in others&rsquo; bloodlines to enhance his strength. In other words, they were staking everything they had on him to deal with Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu nodded his head. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>Without any hesitation, Chu Feng changed his hand seal. The light from the glowing avatar armor immediately joined together to form two gigantic avatars. One was a dragon and the other was a phoenix. The two avatars circled the sky before surging into Long Chengyu&rsquo;s body.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu&rsquo;s avatar armor grew increasingly brighter as the dragon and phoenix avatars coiled around him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, your formation&hellip;&rdquo; Long Chengyu trembled with excitement.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How do you feel, Brother Chengyu?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It feels great. I have never felt this good before!&rdquo; Long Chengyu exclaimed.</span><br><span>In truth, the Totem Dragon Clansmen had constructed a formation with their bloodline powers earlier to raise his fighting prowess earlier, when he was fighting with the rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clansman, but its prowess was nowhere on par with this.</span><br><span>Seeing that it was a success, Chu Feng stopped channeling the formation.</span><br><span>Both the Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen were excited too. Through the formation&rsquo;s connection, they could sense how powerful Long Chengyu was.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re amazing! You were able to harness the power hidden inside the avatar armor to construct such a powerful formation!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd heaped compliments on Chu Feng. None of them had been able to put the avatar armor to good use, but Chu Feng managed to use it as he deemed fit. This feat was more than enough to impress them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The avatar armor is just a container. What the formation truly depletes is still your bloodline power. Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll receive even more benefits from the formation core as long as we successfully defeat the Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clansmen. Thus, I hope that you can grit your teeth and hold on during the fight later on. It&rsquo;s a fight that will determine our survival,&rdquo; Chu Feng instructed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Rest assured, young hero Chu Feng. We&rsquo;ll surely clench our jaws and hold on!&rdquo; the crowd promised.</span><br><span>Following that, Chu Feng waved his sleeves and moved all of the formations backward.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, what are you doing?&rdquo; The crowd was confused.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for us to fight the Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clansmen fair and square. Let&rsquo;s </span><span>hide first and dish out a surprise assault,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! There&rsquo;s no need to fight them fair and square!&rdquo; The crowd agreed with that.</span><br><span>Thus, Chu Feng constructed another concealment formation to hide the crowd.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Feng </span><span>Jiuyue</span><span>, Feng </span><span>Tiansheng</span><span>, and </span><span>Muxi</span><span>, I&rsquo;ll place a concealment formation on each of you. There&rsquo;s no doubt that Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> will attempt to tap into his clansmen&rsquo;s bloodline power when crossing blows with Brother Chengyu, so make sure to exploit any opportunity available to kill as many of their clansmen as possible.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Make sure to tread carefully, for Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> is no fool. He&rsquo;ll do everything he can to protect his clansmen. You should only make a move when there is a clear opening. Otherwise, don&rsquo;t step in even if you catch him taking in his clansmen&rsquo;s bloodline power,&rdquo; Chu Feng instructed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea. I didn&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;d think of something like that!&rdquo; Feng </span><span>Tiansheng</span><span> chuckled.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It is a highly risky maneuver, so only make a move if you spot an opening. Otherwise, just hold still,&rdquo; Chu Feng reminded them again before planting a concealment formation on each of them.</span><br><span>The three of them also utilized their concealment means, which were at a decent level too. Coupled with Chu Feng&rsquo;s concealment formation, it would be difficult for even Chu Feng to spot them unless he was keeping a close watch on them.</span><br><span>With all preparations in place, what was left was to wait for the enemy&rsquo;s arrival.</span><br><span>Chu Feng took this opportunity to take out the compass and examine it. The inscriptions on the compass were not moving at all, but that didn&rsquo;t keep him from examining it. Soon, a tight frown formed on his forehead.</span></p></div>
