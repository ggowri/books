        <div><span>: The Place Where My Mother Is Imprisoned</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>The old woman was surprised that Chu Feng had seen through her, but she still unabashedly continued sending voice transmission to Jie Yu, &ldquo;Young master Jie Yu, his formation is very powerful. You might not necessarily emerge victorious if your formations clash.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Yu&rsquo;s expression darkened.</span><br><span>It had taken him several years of dedicated effort to grasp and master this formation from the Heaven Tome, and it should have made him invincible amongst his peers. The old woman was also aware of that, which made it even more baffling for her to suggest that he might lose in the clash.</span><br><span>Just what kind of formation did Chu Feng construct? Could it really be stronger than a formation from the Heaven Tome?</span><br><span>Unwilling to believe that an outsider could construct a formation that surpassed his, he turned to Chu Feng and sneered, &ldquo;Meaningless tricks. Cut the nonsense and reveal your formation. I&rsquo;ll see for myself whether you&rsquo;re the real deal or not!&rdquo;</span><br><span>With a furious roar, Jie Yu channeled his formation to attack Chu Feng&rsquo;s.</span><br><span>A tempest stirred amidst a brilliant outburst of light, forcing all of the juniors to retreat in a hurry. This powerful formation was set on a single target, and that was the formation before Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>The attack crashed into Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation with a loud explosion, instantaneously shattering it into fragments.</span><br><span>Smiles formed on the juniors&rsquo; faces, only to disappear a split second later.</span><br><span>Another three more formations emerged in the wake of the destroyed formation. It was a compound formation!</span><br><span>&ldquo;That fellow!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The junior realized that the blurry outline of Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation was a mere empty shell. Beneath it laid three tremendously powerful formations.</span><br><span>Jie Yu&rsquo;s formation had indeed reached the limits of what a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist could achieve, but shockingly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s formations were individually on par with his despite their shabby appearance.</span><br><span>Under the circumstances that the formations were equally powerful, three formations were bound to be stronger than one. As a result, it didn&rsquo;t take long for Jie Yu&rsquo;s formation to be crushed.</span><br><span>Jie Yu was sweating profusely and gasping for air. He had already exerted all of his strength, but he was unable to turn the tables on Chu Feng at all. He could only watch helplessly as his formation was torn down.</span><br><span>Indignance warped his face.</span><br><span>He couldn&rsquo;t understand why Chu Feng&rsquo;s ordinary offensive formations were able to match his Heaven&rsquo;s Tome formation. Besides, it didn&rsquo;t make sense how Chu Feng was able to construct three such powerful formations within an hour&rsquo;s time.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Speak! What despicable means did you resort to?&rdquo; Jie Yu hissed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Despicable means? Jie Yu, I should let you know that my big brother Chu Feng already went easy on you! Otherwise, you would have suffered a worse defeat!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing sneered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Shut up! Someone who has lost to me has no right to criticize me!&rdquo; Jie Yu lashed out.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We can do this again if you really wish to. This time around, I&rsquo;ll openly construct the formation for you to see,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>Jie Yu was taken aback, for he noticed the confidence on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face. He turned to the old woman and asked, &ldquo;Elder, did Chu Feng really construct that formation with his own strength?&rdquo;</span><br><span>All of the juniors turned their eyes toward the old woman. They were unwilling to trust Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing, but they trusted the old woman.</span><br><span>The old woman hesitantly looked at Jie Yu before answering the question, &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t rely on any unorthodox means or treasures to construct the formation.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Those words silenced the juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. They turned to look at Chu Feng once more, but the look in their eyes had completely changed.</span><br><span>If Chu Feng had single-handedly constructed those three formations without relying on any external help&hellip; just how powerful was he as a world spiritist? This would mean that Chu Feng was no small fry but a top-notch prodigy.</span><br><span>Jie Yu still found the situation hard to accept, but when he saw how the conceited Bai Yunqing obediently took his place behind Chu Feng like a lackey, he suddenly came to a realization. He finally understood why someone as talented as Bai Yunqing was willing </span><span>to take a subservient position to Chu Feng and address him as his big brother.</span><br><span>Thus, he turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;I concede that my judgment was erroneous. Chu Feng, this is yours.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Yu tossed the Life Crystal toward Chu Feng before turning around to leave.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Where are you going? You haven&rsquo;t called my big brother &lsquo;grandpa&rsquo; yet!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing shouted.</span><br><span>Jie Yu halted in place when he heard those words, but he didn&rsquo;t turn around. He dearly regretted not having taken up Chu Feng&rsquo;s offer earlier, but again, there was no reason for him to do so when he didn&rsquo;t think that he would lose in the first place.</span><br><span>Clearly, that had been a miscalculation on his part.</span><br><span>He didn&rsquo;t want to be a sore loser, which was why he went so far as to stake his Life Crystal in the bet, but he really couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to call Chu Feng &lsquo;grandpa&rsquo;. People from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion tended to look down on outsiders, and that included him too, but who could have thought that he would end up getting humiliated by an outsider?</span><br><span>If he really called Chu Feng &lsquo;grandpa&rsquo;, he would never be able to raise his head before his clansmen ever again!</span><br><span>&ldquo;Forget it. Let&rsquo;s call it quits,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>While Jie Yu was arrogant, he wasn&rsquo;t an unreasonable person. Just the fact that he had held his promise and willingly gave away his Life Crystal after losing the bet already made him a better person than most cultivators out there. In view of that, Chu Feng was willing to end things here.</span><br><span>Jie Yu quietly stared at Chu Feng for a few seconds before taking his leave. The other juniors hurriedly followed after him, but they couldn&rsquo;t resist the urge to glance at Chu Feng. Their eyes were no longer filled with contempt as before, though they seemed a little conflicted.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friends, do you know how to use that crystal to cultivate?&rdquo; the old woman stepped forward and asked with a much politer attitude than before.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, we do,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Shuang Yu has told me to inform you to wait here for a moment if you wish to acquire more Life Crystals. There are other ways to acquire the Life Crystals here, but that&rsquo;s beyond our jurisdiction. We&rsquo;ll have to wait for our lord to return first.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Our lord is the master of the broken sword, as well as the current ruler of this land. The person who entrusted the broken sword to you is an acquaintance of our lord. However, I&rsquo;m afraid that we don&rsquo;t know when our lord will be returning. It could be days; it could also be years. It&rsquo;s up to you to decide whether you wish to wait or not,&rdquo; the old woman said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Follow me then.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The old woman led Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing to a manor in the midst of a green plain.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Remember that you&rsquo;re currently in the territory of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Many of our young masters and young misses will be training in the vicinity over the next few days, and those aren&rsquo;t people you can afford to cross. I suggest you stay put and don&rsquo;t cause any trouble, for I won&rsquo;t be able to bail you out if anything happens,&rdquo; the old woman said.</span><br><span>Those words sounded more like a reminder than a threat. Her attitude toward Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing had become a little more respectful after the two of them had proved their capabilities.</span><br><span>After saying her piece, the old woman took her leave.</span><br><span>Chu Feng cast a sweeping glance at his surroundings, and he felt a tingle in his heart.</span><br><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had always been one of his greatest goals. Admittedly, he wasn&rsquo;t really in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion but one of their territories, but it showed how far he had come. It felt almost as if he was only a step away from his mother now.</span><br><span>&ldquo;She speaks as if the juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion are a huge deal! Other than Ling Xiao, the most talented prodigy of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, there is no one else who is a match for big brother Chu Feng!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing mumbled in dissatisfaction.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ling Xiao is the strongest junior of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, big brother Chu Feng. He is publicly known as the strongest junior of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Rumor has it that his spirit power has already reached Royal Dragon God-cloak last year,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Royal Dragon God-cloak?&rdquo;</span><br><span>That was equivalent to rank six Half-God level, a height that many prodigious world spiritists fail to achieve in their lifetime. The fact that Ling Xiao was able to reach such a level as a junior showed just how monstrously talented he was.</span><br><span>However, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t surprised in the least. How could the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, as the strongest world spiritist organization of the world of cultivation, possibly not have a junior of this caliber?</span><br><span>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t just at Royal Dragon God-cloak anymore,&rdquo; a voice echoed from the air.</span><br><span>It was Jie Yu.</span><br><span>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t surprised by Jie Yu&rsquo;s presence. He had long noticed that Jie Yu was secretly tailing them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked coldly. Clearly, he didn&rsquo;t notice that Jie Yu had been following them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Calm down, I&rsquo;m not here to cause trouble. I just want to clarify a few matters.&rdquo; Jie Yu swooped down from the sky and landed before Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Thanks. I mean, for what happened earlier,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng smiled. Knowing what Jie Yu was driving at, he replied, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sweat it. Your </span><span>Life Crystal is extremely important to me too.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I heard that you&rsquo;re able to awaken the Life Crystal. Is that true?&rdquo; Jie Yu asked.</span><br><span>Instead of answering that question, Chu Feng took out the Life Crystal he had received from Jie Yu earlier and removed the seal on it. The next moment, the Life Crystal emanated a brilliant light, signaling its awakening. Tremendous energy could be felt flowing within the crystal.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&hellip; are actually able to awaken it!&rdquo; Jie Yu&rsquo;s mouth opened agape. It was an expression that was even more exaggerated than when he lost to Chu Feng earlier.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you finally believe us now?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said with a gleeful smirk. He acted almost as if he was the one who awakened the Life Crystal.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, may I know from whom you have learned your world spiritist techniques from?&rdquo; Jie Yu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that I can&rsquo;t divulge that,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; Jie Yu waved his hand. &ldquo;This is my first time seeing anyone awakening the Life Crystal.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Surely the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has its own ways of awakening the Life Crystal?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course! It&rsquo;s just that the awakening requires careful preparation and can only be done at a specific location, which is why I have never been able to witness it in person. As far as I know, there&rsquo;s only one person in our entire Seven Realms Sacred Mansion who is able to awaken the Life Crystal as easily as you did,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Only one person? Heh, I know who you are referring to!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing chirped in.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You know who is it?&rdquo; Jie Yu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy enough to guess. You must be referring to Lord Jie Ranqing! Who else is able to pull off feats that are deemed to be impossible by other world spiritists!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said with glowing eyes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s Lord Jie Ranqing,&rdquo; Jie Yu replied with a smile. His tone had also gotten much politer upon mentioning Jie Ranqing.</span><br><span>Chu Feng felt proud seeing how respected Jie Ranqing was amongst world spiritists, especially since he was almost certain that Jie Ranqing was his mother.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is Lord Jie Ranqing still in closed-door training?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s still in closed-door training,&rdquo; Jie Yu replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Where is she training at?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;At our ancestral forbidden land.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is that a cultivation area for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure about that. The ancestral forbidden land is an important place to our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but honestly speaking, we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s in there either. There are strict restrictions as to who is allowed in there. Not even Ling Xiao is able to access that place,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Even Ling Xiao is unqualified? Your ancestral forbidden land must be a huge deal,&rdquo; Bai </span><span>Yunqing remarked.</span><br><span>Chu Feng jotted down the information in his mind. He knew that his mother was actually not in closed-door training; in truth, she had been imprisoned by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. It was likely that her prison was none other than the ancestral forbidden land.</span><br></p></div>
