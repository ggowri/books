        <div> - Duty And Obligation Of One&rsquo;s Position<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Wuming Fenghuo said those words, everyone grew quiet.<br>Indeed, wasn&rsquo;t that the way the Starfield Master Realm had always handled things?<br>They did not concern themselves with the lives and deaths of others. They only cared about being revered by other powers. That was sufficient for them.<br>Suddenly, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief stood up and exerted all of his strength to kneel before Wuming Fenghuo.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I beg of you. I beg you, please save the Wuma Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, the Wuma Heavenly Clan will likely disappear from the Ancestral Martial Starfield completely.&rdquo;<br>Unfortunately, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s current health was too weak, so weak that he could not even kneel stably. Nevertheless, he still begged for Wuming Fenghuo&rsquo;s help without regard for his own dignity.<br>&ldquo;Senior,&rdquo; Chu Feng immediately lent an arm to support the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, who seemed to be on the verge of collapsing at any moment.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I beg of you,&rdquo; however, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief continued to beg Wuming Fenghuo.<br>From this, it could be seen that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was truly worried about the circumstances of the Wuma Heavenly Clan. Otherwise, as a clan chief, he wouldn&rsquo;t possibly kneel to beg because of another clan.<br>Unfortunately, even though the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was already begging like that, Wuming Fenghuo remained indifferent.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already made myself extremely clear. I will not involve myself in the matter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Chu, you should get up.&rdquo;<br>After Wuming Fenghuo finished saying those words, he turned around and began to walk toward the exit of the palace hall. It would seem that he was determined to not interfere..<br>&ldquo;Lord Wuming Fenghuo.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice was heard. It was Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, is there something you need?&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo turned around and asked.<br>&ldquo;Milord, this junior thanks you for healing my injuries. I also thank you for upholding justice and fairness on the plaza, and allowing me to enter the match.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If Milord wasn&rsquo;t present, our clan would have likely lost the ownership of the Purpletree Ordinary Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng will forever remember your grace.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, this junior begs to differ in regards to your way of the overlord.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As the saying goes, to hold a position, one should uphold one&rsquo;s duty and obligations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since the Starfield Master Realm has reached the position of being the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, they have a responsibility and obligation to allow the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield to live peaceful lives, and prevent tragedies.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Starfield Master Realm should not only rule the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield to serve them and revere them, but they should also protect the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I do not agree with your way of the overlord,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do not make irresponsible remarks! Quickly, apologize to Lord Wuming Fenghuo!&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clansmen were immediately frightened upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. One must know that what he had said was very disgraceful and rebellious in nature. It was totally possible for Wuming Fenghuo to punish Chu Feng for his remarks.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; however, faced with the extremely nervous and worried Chu Heavenly Clansmen, Wuming Fenghuo once again smiled and waved his hand. Then, he looked to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Actually, I also do not agree with such a way of the overlord.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, since you do not agree with it, why do you refuse to help?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Although I do not agree with it, I do not have a Bodhisattva&rsquo;s heart, I&rsquo;m not one who wishes to deliver all creatures from suffering. There exists no friendship between myself and the Wuma Heavenly Clan, so why should I help them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Must I help them just because I am someone from the Starfield Master Realm that rules over the Ancestral Martial Starfield?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who made the rule that those who are strong must help the weak?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If someone wishes to help the weak, they can go ahead and do so. That is their own business. However, one should not make such a demand of others,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo said.<br>&ldquo;Milord, if you were not someone from the Starfield Master Realm, I and my clan&rsquo;s clan chief would not have requested your assistance today. It is as you said, there is no rule stating that those who are strong must help the weak. Indeed, that would depend on the individual.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, that would be limited to only people who possess absolutely no relation to the weak.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, you are someone from the Starfield Master Realm. The power and clan that you belong to is the overlord of our Ancestral Martial Starfield. Everyone in the Ancestral Martial Starfield will listen to your orders.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you think that the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield are completely unrelated to you?&rdquo;<br>Wuming Fenghuo was at a loss as to how to respond to Chu Feng. Even he felt what Chu Feng said to be correct.<br>Indeed, it they were unrelated, he could naturally disregard their life and death, as he did not possess any obligation or duty to concern himself with their lives or deaths.<br>However, since their Starfield Master Realm was acknowledged by and claimed the allegiance of everyone, it meant that there was a relationship between them and the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Regardless of whether their relationship might be that of masters and servants, or whatever else, the fact that they had a relationship meant that the Starfield Master Realm had the responsibility to protect those people.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, just stop talking.&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clansmen had all turned paper pale with fear.<br>If Chu Feng was merely questioning Wuming Fenghuo earlier, then he was openly contradicting him at that moment.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; however, Wuming Fenghuo waved his hand once again to indicate that he was not angered by Chu Feng. Instead, he looked to Chu Feng again and said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, very rarely has there been a person of the younger generation that dared to contradict me the way you did. However, I must admit that what you&rsquo;ve said is very correct.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since our Starfield Master Realm has become the master of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, we possess the responsibility to protect the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. The issue at hand is, even if we do not concern ourselves with the matters of the people, no one will dare to say anything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for me, I have decided to remain indifferent,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo said.<br>&ldquo;If Milord insists on remaining indifferent, then Chu Feng has nothing more to say,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You are truly courageous to dare to say all that. I saw your father&rsquo;s reflection in you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your father also had your courage. That courage is lacked by the great majority of martial cultivators. I feel that it is a good thing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I must still give you a warning. While it is fine to be sharp, one cannot be too sharp. Otherwise, the people that do not wish to be injured by your sharpness will seek to destroy you.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Wuming Fenghuo looked to Chu Feng with a very serious gaze.<br>It was because his gaze was so serious that the crowd felt uneasy.<br>&ldquo;Milord, Chu Feng is still young and immature. I hope that Milord will not mind the offenses committed by a person of lower stature, and forgive Chu Feng this once.&rdquo;<br>In addition to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Chu Hanpeng and Chu Xuanzhengfa also hurriedly knelt on the ground to apologize to Wuming Fenghuo for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You all need not be so nervous. I&rsquo;m merely warning Chu Feng out of goodwill,&rdquo; Seeing such nervous Chu Heavenly Clansmen, Wuming Fenghuo shook his head in a helpless manner. If he truly blamed Chu Feng, he would not have bothered to say so much, but would&rsquo;ve directly attacked him.<br></p></div>
