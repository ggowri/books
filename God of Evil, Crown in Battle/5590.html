        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little Fishy quickly dragged Chu Feng out of the cave and beyond. She only stopped when they were finally a far distance away from the mountain range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That was a close one. It&rsquo;s lucky that she didn&rsquo;t chase after us.&rdquo; Little Fishy turned around and confirmed that the black-robed woman didn&rsquo;t chase after them before heaving a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that woman?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw fear on Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> face. She had never shown such an expression even when faced with Chaotic Era Scholar. This was enough to show that the black-robed woman was a terrifying individual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back, the black-robed woman&rsquo;s gaze had already sent chills running down Chu Feng&rsquo;s spine. Even though she was beautiful, it was hard to feel any goodwill toward her. Her eyes felt like those of a demon. No matter how beautiful a demon was, it was still hard not to feel anxious in its presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;No one knows her name or her origin, but she&rsquo;s known throughout the world of cultivation as a lunatic,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lunatic?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s curiosity was piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s extremely powerful, and she&rsquo;s known to be both vicious and unreasonable. Those who dared to vie with her over a treasure eventually lost their lives. It&rsquo;s a common saying among all powers that the wisest thing to do upon encountering that woman is to run. Even if you meet her on the streets instead of the remnant, it&rsquo;d still be best to immediately turn around and escape. She&rsquo;s so unpredictable that even a glance may incur her wrath,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is she that powerful?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was astonished to learn that even a powerhouse like the Immortal Sea Fish Clan was afraid of that woman. Just how powerful must that woman be then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Her strength is nowhere close to my father, but she&rsquo;s a force to be reckoned with. Even in my Immortal Sea Fish Clan, there are no more than ten people who can suppress her with certainty. One of our grand elders previously encountered her in a remnant, and she attacked him without any hesitation. The grand elder managed to escape with his life, but he lost an arm to her. Even to this day, our grand elder hasn&rsquo;t been able to regenerate his arm. We tried engaging the help of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but it was to no avail,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I guess she&rsquo;s on your clan&rsquo;s blacklist?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;On the contrary, she isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Chu Feng was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As powerful as the woman was, she wasn&rsquo;t beyond the Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s means to deal with. The fact that the Immortal Sea Fish Clan didn&rsquo;t go after her even though one of their grand elders had been injured by her showed that she was a tricky person to deal with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the first place, there were only a handful of people in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan who could deal with her. It wouldn&rsquo;t be wise to declare war on her under such circumstances, lest she exact vengeance on their weaker clansmen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was nothing worse than riling up a lunatic&mdash;their vengeance would be scathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The other galaxy overlords have had conflicts with that woman too, but not even the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has put her on their blacklist. Their evaluation of her is the same as our clan&mdash;run as fast as you can upon encountering her,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This further affirmed just how terrifying that woman was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a close shave,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It is. She&rsquo;s probably examining the item dug up by the Wang Clan in the cave. She wouldn&rsquo;t think that it was a coincidence if we bumped into each other inside the cave; she would suspect that we were after her treasure. That&rsquo;d be dangerous,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was suddenly a gust of cold air, and Chu Feng and Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> faces warped in horror. The white-haired woman suddenly appeared in front of Chu Feng without any warning. Her face was barely a few millimeters away from Chu Feng&rsquo;s, practically pressing right against his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were still as ferocious as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shocked, Chu Feng subconsciously took a few steps back. Even someone as daring as him found himself panicking in this abrupt situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little Fishy quickly stepped in front of Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Elder, we were just passing by this area. We didn&rsquo;t mean to offend you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had spoken those words amicably, even resorting to her sweet smile. Yet, that woman was unmoved. She shoved Little Fishy aside and continued glaring at Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, I am a princess of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>.&rdquo; Seeing that the situation had gone awry, Little Fishy chose to bring up her identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman finally turned her gaze to Little Fishy and asked, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, elder.&rdquo; Little Fishy even took out her token to prove her identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman waved her sleeve, exerting a suction force toward Little Fishy. The latter&rsquo;s body began to contract upon contact with the suction force as she got pulled into the woman&rsquo;s sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, you&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng was just about to speak when the woman suddenly looked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you want her to live or die?&rdquo; the woman asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I want her to live,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t hear our conversation right now. You better speak honestly if you want her to live.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman waved her other sleeve and released a surge of spirit power that quickly formed a person&rsquo;s portrait. Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart clenched upon seeing that portrait. It was the portrait of his father, Chu </span><span>Xuanyuan</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you recognize him?&rdquo; the woman asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng thought that the woman was staring at him because she wanted to kill him, but it turned out that he recognized his father instead. She must have seen the resemblance in the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Tell her your identity, Chu Feng,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had stopped cultivating upon realizing that Chu Feng was in danger. Based on what she had observed, she thought that it would be best for Chu Feng to speak the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was initially hesitant as he couldn&rsquo;t tell whether that woman was his father&rsquo;s enemy or friend, but upon hearing </span><span>Eggy&rsquo;s</span><span> advice, he also thought that it was best for him to be honest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He is my father,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman&rsquo;s eyes widened in surprise, though it was hard to tell if it was because Chu Feng was too honest or that his answer was unexpected to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, I am telling the truth. The person you have drawn is indeed my father,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;No wonder you look alike.&rdquo; The woman looked at Chu Feng once more, but her fierce eyes had considerably mellowed down from before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, do you know my father?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of answering that question, that woman asked, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your father right now?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A frown formed on the woman&rsquo;s forehead, as the atmosphere around her turned cold again. Clearly, she wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with Chu Feng&rsquo;s answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she quickly retracted her hostility a moment later as if realizing her mistake. She even turned around, possibly out of fear that she would display her hostility toward him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Something is amiss, Chu Feng. That woman appears to harbor conflicting feelings toward you. Could she be one of your father&rsquo;s ex-lovers?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I also feel like something is amiss. I can feel deep sentiments in her gaze,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the woman turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Have you heard the saying that a son should repay his father&rsquo;s debt?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart sank. Could it be that they were on the mark? If the woman was truly one of his father&rsquo;s ex-lovers, this was definitely a debt he didn&rsquo;t want to repay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Your father stole something from me two years ago,&rdquo; the woman said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart tightened. He suddenly thought that it would have been much better if that woman was really one of his father&rsquo;s ex-lovers.</span></p></div>
