        <div>: Explosive Temper<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, are they really fine falling in there?&rdquo; Shengguang Chuyao asked worriedly.<br>He was talking about Shengguang Xintian and Shengguang Haoxuan.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chuyao, don&rsquo;t worry. These two lakes are paths we&rsquo;ll have to pass through in order to continue ahead. Anyone who wishes to move on will have to choose one out of these two lakes. It&rsquo;s just that the one that usually looks worse on the surface would have better effects. I didn&rsquo;t just throw the two of them in order to get back at them; it&rsquo;ll be helpful to them too,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>The crowd reserved doubts regarding Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>Be it the smell or the appearance, the yellow lake looked no different from fecal water.<br>&ldquo;If we have to choose one of the two, which one are you intending to take?&rdquo; Shengguang Menglai asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;d choose this one.&rdquo;<br>Putong! Chu Feng leaped into the lake.<br>However, the one he chose wasn&rsquo;t the putrid yellow lake but the clear one.<br>&ldquo;That fellow is really deceiving us. He told us that the yellow lake is better, but he still chose the other one!&rdquo;<br>The juniors of the Holy Valley criticized Chu Feng right after he leaped into the clear lake. They thought that he was lying to them yet again.<br>They turned their eyes toward Shengguang Menglai and Shengguang Chuyao to see what they were going to do next.<br>&ldquo;Miss Menglai, what do we do now? Are we going to listen to Chu Feng and leap into the lake as well?&rdquo;<br>They were skeptical about anything coming out of Chu Feng&rsquo;s mouth at this point.<br>&ldquo;You can make your own decision.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Menglai shot them a cold glance before leaping into the same clear lake that Chu Feng chose.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The juniors of the Holy Valley were put at a loss.<br>&ldquo;Follow us,&rdquo; Shengguang Chuyao said before leaping into the clear lake too.<br>Seeing that Shengguang Menglai and Shengguang Chuyao had already made their moves, the other juniors also did the same too. They leaped into the water and were swiftly tied down by the powerful whirlpool, leaving them with no choice but to go with the flow.<br>They were still feeling uneasy at the start, but their hearts were put at ease upon entering the lake. In fact, they were even feeling a little happy about it. Waves of energy beneficial to their cultivation were washing over their bodies, nourishing them.<br>Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t lied to them. Other than serving as a passageway, this lake was also beneficial to their cultivation too.<br>They would have preferred to stay in the clear lake for a longer period of time, but the whirlpool relentlessly swept them out of the lake. They found themselves passing through a world spiritist gate.<br>On the other side of the gate was a humongous palace made out of stones. There weren&rsquo;t any exquisite sculptures or inscriptions. The walls and floor were flat as well. Yet, despite its simplistic appearance, it gave off an air of authority.<br>Chu Feng, Shengguang Menglai, and Shengguang Chuyao were standing in the midst of this palace, unharmed by the earlier turbulence.<br>However, Shengguang Haoxuan and Shengguang Xintian, who were the first ones to enter the yellow lake, were nowhere to be seen.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, why aren&rsquo;t the two of them here yet?&rdquo; Shengguang Chuyao asked worriedly.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chuyao, there&rsquo;s no need to worry. Let me put it this way. There are three stages to this cultivation ground. The first step is cleansing, which is what we have just gone through. Those two are going through a more special type of cleansing, so the process is comparatively longer for them,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, are there really greater benefits to be derived from the other lake?&rdquo; Shengguang Chuyao asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;Of course. I wouldn&rsquo;t lie to you,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you enter the other lake then?&rdquo;<br>The moment Shengguang Chuyao posed that question, the crowd turned to look at Chu Feng, including Shengguang Menglai. This was something that all of them wished to know.<br>If Chu Feng was so certain that the other lake brought about greater benefits, there shouldn&rsquo;t have been any reason for him to opt for the clear lake. After all, there was no cultivator who wouldn&rsquo;t want to grow stronger.<br>They wanted to know the reason behind this bizarre contradiction.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the answer clear? You saw that lake earlier; it&rsquo;s no different from fecal water. I&rsquo;d rather cultivate a little slower than to enter a lake filled with feces,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Chuyao was rendered speechless. There was some sense in what Chu Feng said since cultivators had dignity too, but Shengguang Haoxuan and Shengguang Xintian would probably be unwilling to bathe inside the fecal lake either.<br>Chu Feng was the one who forced the two of them in there!<br>Weng!<br>A yellow spirit formation gate carrying a putrid stench suddenly materialized.<br>The moment the crowd saw the spirit formation gate, they knew that Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t been lying to them. Shengguang Haoxuan and Shengguang Xintian were indeed safe and sound.<br>Just as expected, a silhouette rushed out the moment the spirit formation gate opened. It was Shengguang Haoxuan.<br>He was severely injured prior to entering the yellow lake, but there was not the slightest injury to be found on his body anymore. This showed that there was indeed something special about the yellow lake, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t have recovered so quickly.<br>It was just that while he was in a much better condition than before, his body was giving off a stench similar to that of the yellow lake.<br>Just smelling the horrible stench coming from Shengguang Haoxuan made Chu Feng's decision relatable to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Haoxuan stood up and smelled himself with a repulsed look before directing a sharp glare at Chu Feng.<br>When had he, a young master of the Holy Valley, suffered such grievances before?<br>Seeing this, Shengguang Chuyao and many of the other juniors of the Holy Valley quickly sent voice transmissions over to Shengguang Haoxuan to explain the situation to him. It was only then that Shengguang Haoxuan&rsquo;s livid complexion improved a little, and he turned his eyes away from Chu Feng with a cold harrumph.<br>In truth, he wouldn&rsquo;t have dared to pick a fight with Chu Feng anyway. He knew that he would only be asking for a beating by picking a fight with the current Chu Feng.<br>Shortly after, Shengguang Xintian flew out of the spirit formation gate too.<br>She was in a good physical state, just that she was giving off the same putrid stench. It was as if the smell had fused together with her body, to the extent that she was having trouble trying to wash it out.<br>The moment she appeared, Shengguang Chuyao and the others sent voice transmissions to Shengguang Xintian to inform her about the situation, telling her that Chu Feng was still in possession of that bundle of energy and that she shouldn&rsquo;t mess with him now.<br>However, it was as if Shengguang Xintian couldn&rsquo;t hear their words at all. She rose to her feet and charged straight at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll kill you!!!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xintian&rsquo;s temper was even worse than Shengguang Haoxuan. She couldn&rsquo;t care less whether Chu Feng still had the bundle of energy or not. At this moment, the only thought reigning in her mind was that she had to teach Chu Feng a lesson.<br>No, it wasn&rsquo;t just to the extent of teaching him a lesson. She was emanating killing intent&hellip; She was intending to kill Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
