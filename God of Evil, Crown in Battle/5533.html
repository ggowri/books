        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>A hand suddenly fell on Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulder. It was Long Chengyu.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Brother Chu Feng. We&rsquo;ll surely succeed. With the enhancement of your formation, I&rsquo;ll surely be able to subdue Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>. Even </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> wouldn&rsquo;t be a match for me in my current state!&rdquo; Long Chengyu said with a confident smile.</span><br><span>He had noticed a tense expression on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face despite the preparations they had made, so he specially came over to console him. While it was not very obvious, those who were paying attention could tell that Chu Feng was worrying over something.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chengyu, I trust you,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span><br><span>What worried him wasn&rsquo;t Long Chengyu&rsquo;s strength but that he hadn&rsquo;t fully deciphered the compass&rsquo; content. The mysterious existence had told him that they would only be safe when he deciphered the compass&rsquo; content, or else they would lose their lives here.</span><br><span>The mysterious existence was a formidable figure; their intervention was the reason Chu Feng could enter here in the first place. Due to that, he didn&rsquo;t think the mysterious existence was joking with him. Thus, the greatest question on his mind right now was not the Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clan but the compass. Just what kind of </span><span>secret was hidden inside the compass?</span><br><span>Chu Feng closed his eyes.</span><br><span>He figured that since he wasn&rsquo;t able to gather any more clues from the compass itself, his time was better spent organizing the clues he had gathered. Fervent in the pursuit of the compass&rsquo; secrets, he soon fell into deep thoughts.</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>As the moment of reckoning drew closer, the Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen began to worry. As much as they trusted Chu Feng, they still harbored concerns. They didn&rsquo;t know if the situation would develop in the direction Chu Feng mentioned.</span><br><span>All of a sudden, a brilliant ray of light sprouted from the ground. The earth quaked as a gigantic being slowly surfaced from the underground. It was the formation core Long Chengyu and the others saw earlier, but it was no longer just an outline but the complete formation core.</span><br><span>The outside of the formation core glowed with a brilliant golden light, whereas the inside was suffused with a beautiful blood-red aura.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is this the formation core Chu Feng mentioned? I can sense it. With its help, we can absorb the avatar armor around us. If so, our journey here wouldn&rsquo;t have been in vain!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Both the Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen were excited to see the formation core. They instinctively sensed that as long as they stepped into the formation core, they would be able to absorb their avatar armor, thus greatly boosting their bloodline power.</span><br><span>While that didn&rsquo;t translate to direct growth in their cultivation, it would boost their talents and expand their potential, allowing them to reach greater heights. Nothing was more valuable to a cultivator than that.</span><br><span>That was also why they were so excited.</span><br><span>However, the formation core was still in a closed state even though the formation had fully surfaced. None of them were able to enter it yet.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, it looks like we&rsquo;ll need to use our bloodline power to open the formation core.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd looked at Chu Feng. They couldn&rsquo;t wait for the formation core to be opened.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You can accelerate the opening of the formation core with your bloodline power, but it&rsquo;ll still take time before it fully opens. Besides, it&rsquo;ll open on its own accord even if you don&rsquo;t do a thing at all,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>The crowd had a lot of trust in Chu Feng, which was why they obediently held their positions after hearing his words despite being seduced by the benefits inside the formation core.</span><br><span>Moments later, several figures landed in the vicinity. They were all Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clansmen, though Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> wasn&rsquo;t amongst them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Could it be possible that Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> didn&rsquo;t rally them together beforehand?&rdquo; Long Chengyu deduced.</span><br><span>Chu Feng watched the situation with grim eyes, not saying a word at all.</span><br><span>Excited by the sight of the formation core, the Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clansmen began exerting their bloodline power to accelerate the opening of the formation core.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s make a move now. They are already infusing their bloodline power into the formation. Won&rsquo;t they get the initiative if we take too long to make a move?&rdquo; Both the Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen urged Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t want to reveal himself, but he didn&rsquo;t know whether they would lose the initiative if they continued allowing the Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clansmen to continue infusing their aura into the formation core.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, will they claim the initiative at this rate?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t confirm that,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s kill them first before going back into hiding,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I suspect that Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> is in the vicinity. This could be a bait to lure us out.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t a problem. With the enhancement of your formation, I&rsquo;m confident that I can deal with Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> face-on.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chengyu, are you confident about it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Long Chengyu replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Very well. Kill them then,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu rose from his hiding spot. With a single punch, he released a torrent of martial power that obliterated all of those Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clansmen. They had already disintegrated into ashes before they could even let out a squeak.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chengyu, on your left!&rdquo; Chu Feng shouted.</span><br><span>He noticed that a fatal burst of energy was sweeping over from the left side. Long Chengyu quickly swung his God </span><span>Armement</span><span> down toward the left, releasing a burst of martial power.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>A powerful shockwave shook the surroundings. A figure emerged from the shadows.</span><br><span>Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>.</span><br><span>The earlier attack had indeed come from Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>. Having known that Chu Feng might lay an ambush, he intentionally dispatched his clansmen to the formation core to lure them out while hiding in the vicinity himself.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I was right. You were camping here,&rdquo; Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> sneered as he looked at Chu Feng with a triumphant gaze. &ldquo;Chu Feng, I guess it is a bluff, after all. You wouldn&rsquo;t have laid an ambush here if you were able to easily defeat me.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>, I am stronger than you, but Brother Chengyu is interested to have a face-off with you. I don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;re qualified to cross hands with me either, because Brother Chengyu is more than enough to slaughter all of you,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Hahahaha</span><span>!&rdquo; Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> raised his head and laughed heartily. He pointed his finger at Long Chengyu and said, &ldquo;Him? He isn&rsquo;t my match at all!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Those words were spoken with absolute confidence, not giving any respect to Long Chengyu.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chengyu, I&rsquo;ll be leaving it to you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu tightened his grip on his God Armament before charging at Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>In the blink of an eye, Long Chengyu had already started clashing with Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>.</span><br><span>The formation&rsquo;s effects didn&rsquo;t show right away as Chu Feng intentionally concealed it, but as the latter strengthened the prowess of the formation, its might began to show. Dragon and phoenix avatars coiled around Long Chengyu, leaving not a sliver of doubt that he had the enhancement of a formation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That explains why you dare to cross blows with me. It turns out that you have the enhancement of a formation. Long Chengyu, I guess that&rsquo;s all you amount to,&rdquo; Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> sneered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how long you can keep up that tough talk,&rdquo; Long Chengyu replied confidently.</span><br><span>With the formation&rsquo;s enhancement, Long Chengyu began to claim the upper hand in the battle.</span></p></div>
