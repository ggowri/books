        <h1>Chapter 3800</h1>
        <div> - The Arrival Of An Utmost Exalted<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Move aside. Get away from me. I&rsquo;ve done no wrong. Why are you all doing this? Why?&rdquo;<br>Song Ge struggled violently. However, her struggles were completely useless. Her hands were completely held by that person. She was powerless to stop him from taking the Void Cleanse Monastery&rsquo;s title plate from her.<br>Finally, Song Ge was unable to contain herself. The tears in her eyes began to flow, flooding her cheeks.<br>She truly felt wronged. She was a genius. Over the years, there were countless sects that had sought her out and asked her to join them.<br>However, regardless of which sect they were, all of them were declined by Song Ge.<br>She believed that as long as she devoted herself to the Void Cleanse Monastery, they would definitely not let her down.<br>However, what happened at that moment had broadened her horizons and opened her eyes.<br>It turned out that her loyalty and devotion were completely worthless compared to the Void Cleanse Monastery&rsquo;s self-interest.<br>&ldquo;Why? Why? Why are you all treating me this way?&rdquo;<br>Song Ge shouted herself hoarse. Weeping sounds filled with the grievance of injustice resonated throughout the plaza.<br>Hearing Song Ge&rsquo;s cries, Chu Feng felt very pained. In addition to Chu Feng, many elders and disciples of the Void Cleanse Monastery also felt extremely pained.<br>However, they were all powerless to change anything. Furthermore, no one dared to try to change it. In fact, no one dared to even plead for leniency for Song Ge.<br>&ldquo;Why? Because you&rsquo;ve done all sorts of evil deeds.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Men! Drive her out!&rdquo; the Void Cleanse Monastery&rsquo;s headmaster said loudly as he pointed to Song Ge.<br>&ldquo;I shall see who dares touch her!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice exploded in the sky.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>After that voice was heard, the surroundings started to tremble violently.<br>Many people found themselves unable to stand firm. One by one, they fell to the ground, rolling repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;What was that? What just happened?&rdquo;<br>Merely a furious shout managed to frighten many of the people present to the point where they turned pale.<br>Even though they&rsquo;d all managed to hear that voice clearly and understood the intention behind those words, the might displayed by that voice was simply too terrifying.<br>Because of that, they felt that voice to not be the voice of a person, but rather a voice signaling the arrival of doomsday.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The next instant, thunder began to rumble as violent winds swept forth. An extremely powerful oppressive might emerged from the sky.<br>When that oppressive might appeared, the people present all felt as though they&rsquo;d fallen into hell.<br>Too powerful. That oppressive might was simply too powerful.<br>The disciples, elders and even the Void Cleanse Monastery&rsquo;s headmaster and Zuo Ying&rsquo;s father were all able to sense how terrifying that oppressive might was.<br>That oppressive might not only surpassed the Martial Immortal realm of cultivation, but it seemed to have even surpassed the Exalted Realm.<br>They were able to tell that the person who possessed that oppressive might was capable of destroying all of them, body and soul, with a single thought.<br>Most importantly, a figure had appeared together with that oppressive might. That person landed on the plaza. It was Old Freak Tang.<br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to Milord.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Void Cleanse Monastery had no idea that Milord would arrive, and failed to properly receive you. I hope that Milord will forgive us." The Void Cleanse Monastery&rsquo;s headmaster immediately knelt upon seeing Old Freak Tang.<br>Seeing that, the others from the Void Cleanse Monastery also knelt uniformly. Even Zuo Ying&rsquo;s father did the same.<br>In fact, even Song Ge was so terrified that she promptly knelt as well.<br>Like the others, she had never experienced such a powerful oppressive might in her entire life.<br>However, right after Song Ge knelt, a powerful arm forcibly helped her up.<br>She turned around and saw that it was Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Asura?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Asura, you&rsquo;ve come?&rdquo;<br>Song Ge immediately revealed a joyous look on her face after seeing Chu Feng. She hurriedly wiped away her tears, fearing that Chu Feng would discover that she had suffered grievance.<br>&ldquo;You should leave quickly. Someone extraordinary has arrived in this place.&rdquo;<br>Soon, Song Ge pushed Chu Feng away and urged him to leave quickly.<br>She was afraid that he would be implicated by the unexpected crisis.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Take a close look at who that person is. Do you not know him?&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Song Ge.<br>Hearing those words, Song Ge revealed a look of puzzlement.<br>After all, she knew very well that she simply did not know someone that powerful.<br>Though confused, Song Ge still cast her gaze over.<br>&ldquo;Uncle Tang?&rdquo;<br>Upon looking, Song Ge&rsquo;s expression changed enormously.<br>That person was also a resident of Autumnfall Village. He was someone who had seen her grow up. It was impossible for her to not know about Old Freak Tang.<br>&ldquo;What? Uncle Tang?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Song Ge, do not be rude!&rdquo;<br>The Void Cleanse Monastery&rsquo;s headmaster immediately berated Song Ge upon hearing her address Old Freak Tang as Uncle Tang.<br>&ldquo;You shut up!&rdquo;<br>Right after the Void Cleanse Monastery&rsquo;s headmaster said those words, he received a furious shout from Old Freak Tang.<br>The furious shout brought forth a strong gale that blew the Void Cleanse Monastery&rsquo;s headmaster several meters away.<br>Even though the Void Cleanse Monastery&rsquo;s headmaster was uninjured, he was shivering all over and did not stand back up. Instead, he directly knelt and began to kowtow to Old Freak Tang. &ldquo;Milord, please spare me, please spare me. This lowly one had no intention of offending you. Milord, please spare me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Listen carefully, since she is no longer someone of your Void Cleanse Monastery, none of you are qualified to berate her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, even if she were still someone from your Void Cleanse Monastery, none of you would be qualified to berate her.&rdquo;<br>Each and every word spoken by Old Freak Tang was thunderous. His voice was so strong and powerful that it ripped through space and the void.<br>The people from the Void Cleanse Monastery all shivered in fear.<br>In fact, it was not only the people of the Void Cleanse Monastery. Even Song Ge had turned pale with fright.<br>She had never seen such powerful oppressive might in her entire life.<br>She felt that Old Freak Tang simply did not resemble a human. Instead, he was more like a god.<br>A god that could determine the life and death of another person with a single expression, a single thought.<br>Even though that was clearly the Uncle Tang she'd known for many years, she no longer dared to speak to him.<br>It was only at that moment that she realized that Old Freak Tang was actually such a terrifying existence.<br>&ldquo;Ge&rsquo;er, don&rsquo;t be afraid. I&rsquo;m here today to uphold justice for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No one will be able to bully you again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, I, your father, am an Utmost Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not to mention this bunch of trash, no one in the entire Reincarnation Upper Realm will be able to bully my daughter.&rdquo;<br>Old Freak Tang walked over to Song Ge. He appeared to be very emotional. As he spoke, tears could be seen seeping out the corners of his eyes.<br>However, his tone was very gentle. He was afraid, afraid that he might injure his daughter.<br>&ldquo;Utmost Exalted? He&rsquo;s an Utmost Exalted?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens! He&rsquo;s actually a legendary Utmost Exalted-level expert?!&rdquo;<br>The people from the Void Cleanse Monastery became even more terrified upon hearing the words &lsquo;Utmost Exalted.&rsquo;<br>To them, Utmost Exalted-level existences were simply akin to gods.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Uncle Tang&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Old Freak Tang had come to stand up for her, Song Ge was pleasantly surprised, and overwhelmed by his favor.<br>However, all of a sudden, her expression turned stern. She stood there dumbstruck with her eyes tightly focused on Old Freak Tang.<br>&ldquo;Uncle Tang, what did you say earlier? You said&hellip; you are my what?&rdquo; Song Ge asked with a trembling voice.<br></p></div>
