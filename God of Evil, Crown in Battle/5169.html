        <h1>Chapter 5168</h1>
        <div>: Who Is a Coward?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re courting death.&rdquo;<br>Before the peak Utmost Exalted level man could even get close to the young man, he was halted by a massive hand that suddenly darted out of nowhere and grabbed his throat. The hand was from one of the two elders accompanying the young man.<br>The elder exerted force on his throat, and a loud &lsquo;kacha&rsquo; echoed. Just like that, the<br>Utmost Exalted level cultivator lost his life.<br>Chu Feng was surprised to see that. He didn&rsquo;t think that the old man would be so audacious as to kill the<br>Utmost Exalted level right away.<br>&ldquo;My gosh! This aura! Is he at<br>Martial Exalted level?&rdquo;<br>The faces of the crowd paled in horror.<br>Even though they were born in a Lower Realm, they were still cultivators from the Totem Galaxy. They had probably sensed the aura of a<br>Martial Exalted level cultivator before. Due to that, they were able to determine the elder&rsquo;s strength despite the gap in their cultivation.<br>Hearing those words, the young man smiled in glee. He walked up to the beautiful woman from the nameless sect and grabbed her robe.<br>Sha!<br>He tore off half of her robe, leaving just her undergarments intact.<br>&ldquo;Senior, save me!&rdquo;<br>The beautiful woman turned to the dashing male disciple and her fellow sect members for help, but none of them dared to say a word at all. It was not that they didn&rsquo;t want to save the beautiful woman but they were intimidated by the<br>Martial Exalted level elder.<br>They were afraid that they might be the next to die if they dared to interfere.<br>Even the dashing young man also feigned deaf.<br>&ldquo;Those trash can&rsquo;t possibly save you. Just play with me a little and make me comfortable, and I&rsquo;ll spare the lives of you and your fellow sect members. Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll purge your entire sect!&rdquo; the young man said.<br>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;<br>Despite the beautiful woman&rsquo;s gentle appearance, she was a person with spunk. She refused to submit despite the danger. Instead, she drew her sword and pushed it toward her own heart.<br>Before the blade could pierce her chest, the young man had already snatched it away.<br>&ldquo;You wish to end your own life? It looks like you don&rsquo;t care about your sect,&rdquo; the young man sneered.<br>The beautiful woman didn&rsquo;t say a word. There was no way she wouldn&rsquo;t care about her own sect, but she was unwilling to have her honor sullied.<br>&ldquo;Junior Yue, why don&rsquo;t you accede to his request this once? Even if not for yourself, you should at least consider us.&rdquo;<br>Greater despair awaited her. Her fellow sect members actually started persuading her to do as the young man told her to. The beautiful woman was initially stunned before despair filled her face.<br>She closed her eyes and murmured, &ldquo;Kill me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Kill you? How boring would that be? Since you&rsquo;re unwilling to serve me, I&rsquo;ll just have to make you do it.&rdquo;<br>The young man covered the beautiful woman&rsquo;s body with his oppressive might and controlled her hands to strip off her remaining clothes.<br>Despite having lost control of her body, the beautiful woman wouldn&rsquo;t stop crying. She could only watch helplessly as others humiliated her, unable to even end her own life to stop this nightmare. There was no greater despair than this.<br>Shoosh!<br>All of a sudden, her body regained its freedom. A cloak covered her, hiding her naked body. At closer look, two figures had appeared in front of her.<br>The disciples of the nameless sect widened their eyes in shock.<br>They recognized those two people. They were the cowards whom the dashing male disciple insulted back at the monastery. They didn&rsquo;t expect them to appear here.<br>The beautiful woman was stunned as well. She realized that the two of them had come here to save her. She had never imagined that a day would come where her fellow sect members who always fawned on her would abandon her in a time of need, and two strangers would instead step forward to rescue her.<br>&ldquo;Brat, how dare you interrupt my fun? Are you asking to die?&rdquo; the young man asked coldly.<br>Uwa!<br>A deep groan escaped from his mouth the next instant as he was sent flying into the distance with blood spraying all over the place.<br>Chu Feng had penetrated his stomach with a single strike.<br>Chu Feng was no kind soul. He wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to massacre hundreds of millions if he had to, let alone save others. It was against his principles to pick on the weak without any reason, but he knew that the world of cultivation was a jungle where the strongest reigned, so he had no qualms turning a blind eye to the suffering of strangers.<br>However, he couldn&rsquo;t stand it when three types of people were being oppressed&mdash;the elderly, children, and women.<br>From what he had seen thus far, the young man wasn&rsquo;t here to buy anything. He was passing by this area and happened to spot the beautiful woman, which piqued his lust. Thus, he decided to kick up a fuss here.<br>Those behind the young man looked accustomed to his actions, showing that it was not the first time he had committed such atrocities. Thus, there was no reason foor Chu Feng to hold back here.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re courting death!&rdquo;<br>The<br>Martial Exalted level old man released his killing intent and charged at Chu Feng. He swiped his hand at Chu Feng&rsquo;s neck as if an eagle talon.<br>He was planning to kill Chu Feng the same way he had killed the<br>Utmost Exalted cultivator earlier.<br>Wu!<br>His viciousness swiftly faded the moment he approached Chu Feng. A cry of agony escaped from his mouth.<br>Instead of grabbing Chu Feng&rsquo;s neck, his neck ended up getting grabbed by Chu Feng instead. Chu Feng had activated the Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor the moment the elder made a move. It wasn&rsquo;t enough to push his cultivation to Half-God level, but he was now a rank stronger than<br>Martial Exalted level cultivators.<br>Naturally, the elder wasn&rsquo;t a match for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That fellow!&rdquo;<br>Seeing how Chu Feng held a<br>Martial Exalted level by his neck as easily as grabbing a chick, the disciples of the nameless sect paled in fright. They finally understood just what kind of terrifying existence they had offended earlier.<br>In particular, the dashing male disciple&rsquo;s face was as awful as one could imagine.<br>He thought that he was doomed when he recalled those arrogant words he had said to Chu Feng and City Lord Liang earlier,<br>&ldquo;You scoundrel, hurry up and let us go! We&rsquo;re from the Situ World Spiritist Clan!&rdquo; the other elder bellowed.<br>The comrades of the young man took out their tokens and flashed them. The words &lsquo;Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo; were written on them. Those tokens also emanated a unique aura that proved their authenticity.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re from the Situ World Spiritist Clan?&rdquo;<br>The beautiful woman sunk into despair once more. She thought that she was finally saved, but who could have thought that the young man had such a powerful background? While the Situ World Spiritist Clan wasn&rsquo;t the overlord of their starfield, they had at least heard of them.<br>Needless to say, they couldn&rsquo;t afford to offend the overlord of the True Dragon Starfield.<br>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a young master from the Situ World Spiritist Clan?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! I am Situ Yang, and my grandfather is an elder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan. You&rsquo;re dead meat for daring to lay your hands on me!&rdquo; the young man roared.<br>Pu!<br>Blood suddenly splashed all around.<br>Chu Feng had imploded the<br>Martial Exalted level elder into blood water. His deed shocked everyone, including those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan. The young man was no exception.<br>They had already reported their name, so how could the other party still dare to make a move on them?<br>&ldquo;I was still considering whether I should let you off with just a beating, but since you&rsquo;re from the Situ World Spiritist Clan, you need not dream of leaving this place alive,&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.<br>The SItu World Spiritist Clansmen lurched in horror.<br>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo;<br>Without any hesitation, they turned tail and fled. However, they only barely managed to rise into the air before their heads suddenly crashed into something, causing their skull to dent.<br>It turned out that Chu Feng had constructed an invisible barrier around them.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. You won&rsquo;t be the only ones to die. It won&rsquo;t be long before the others from the Situ World Spiritist Clan join you.&rdquo;<br>Miserable screams ensued.<br>It took only moments for everyone from the Situ World Spiritist Clan to be killed and have their origin energies absorbed. Chu Feng also took their treasures too.<br>After all was done, Chu Feng began making his way toward the dashing male disciple.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I was foolish to not have recognized your greatness! Please don&rsquo;t hold it against me! I beg of you, spare me!&rdquo;<br>The dashing male disciple immediately kneeled to Chu Feng and kowtowed while slapping his own cheeks. He fully expressed his apology with his actions. He knew that someone who dared to massacre a party from the Situ World Spiritist Clan would have no qualms killing him too.<br>No matter how slim the chances were, this was the only way he could possibly survive here. He had to grasp every straw of hope he had.<br>Chu Feng looked at the other disciples from the nameless sect and sneered, &ldquo;Do you understand now who the real cowards are?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
