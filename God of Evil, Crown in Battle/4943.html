        <h1>Chapter 4942</h1>
        <div>: The Blue-robed Figures<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, I know that what I&rsquo;ve done today will bring scorn upon our Zhuge Clan, but I have no choice. This legacy formation was left behind by Lord Situ Qi. The previous clan chief has instructed me to guard everything Lord Situ Qi has left to us, especially this legacy formation. No outsiders must be allowed to enter the legacy formation. I can&rsquo;t turn a blind eye toward the will of my predecessor,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>He raised his hand, and several members of the Zhuge Clan who were waiting outside began marching into the hall with huge chests. Those members opened the chests and revealed the treasures lying within.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, our Zhuge Clan has its own difficulties. Please forgive us for our offense. You may take this as compensation,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said with an apologetic look on his face.<br>&ldquo;You have even prepared the compensation. It looks like you have it all planned out from the start. What does this even mean? Are you trying to pacify us after giving us a tight slap? What do you take us for?&rdquo;<br>The one who stood forward this time around wasn&rsquo;t Shengguang Baimei but Shengguang Buyu.<br>Whoosh!<br>He waved his sleeves, and all of the treasures presented toppled all over the ground.<br>&ldquo;Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, you&rsquo;ll regret insulting us today,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu spat through gritted teeth.<br>&ldquo;Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, it looks like our years of relationship have been in vain. Know that I&rsquo;m not one to allow others to trample all over me. I hope you&rsquo;ll remember what you did today,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren also spoke up as well.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, young friend Chu Feng, Lord Baimei, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said before he started making his way out of the hall.<br>Chu Feng was infuriated, but he knew that there was nothing he could do here. Arguing with the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief wouldn&rsquo;t solve the problem.<br>As frustrating as it was, the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s defensive barrier was beyond their means to deal with. They could only accept the outcome and step down for now.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, is there a need to go to this extent? This is unlike you,&rdquo; Zhuge Feiluan said with a sigh before leaving in disappointment.<br>It could be seen that it wasn&rsquo;t Zhuge Feiluan&rsquo;s intention to conceal his spirit power. He felt deeply ashamed of this undeserved victory.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, those whom we have offended today are no ordinary people. Chu Feng is a prodigy. Those from the Holy Light Clan appear to wield strength rivaling us. There&rsquo;s also Princess Xiaoxiao and Master Yin Ren.&rdquo;<br>The elders of the Zhuge Clan revealed worried looks.<br>&ldquo;Haa, I&rsquo;m well aware that my actions have made many formidable enemies for our Zhuge Clan, but you should have seen for yourself how skilled Chu Feng is. His proficiency of world spiritist techniques surpasses that of Feiluan&rsquo;s. What if he really clears the legacy formation if we grant him entry?&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;I know that Chu Feng is formidable, but Feiluan has entered the legacy formation multiple times but to no avail. Surely Chu Feng can&rsquo;t possibly obtain the legacy in a single attempt?&rdquo; someone asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as good as gambling. We can&rsquo;t risk it no matter how slim his chances are. This is a bet that we can&rsquo;t afford to lose,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>He looked at the object in his hand. It was the Divine Spirit Tree&rsquo;s Black Fruit he had obtained from Princess Xiaoxiao earlier on.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to leave the Nine Souls Galaxy anyway. It matters not whether we offend them or not since we won&rsquo;t be meeting again. As long as we&rsquo;re able to guard our ancestors&rsquo; legacy, it&rsquo;ll be worth it even if we have to sell our souls.&rdquo;<br>The other elders looked at the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief with sympathetic gazes.<br>Outsiders might not understand, but they knew what kind of responsibility and stress their clan chief was carrying on his shoulders.<br>At this point, Chu Feng and the others had already left the Zhuge Clan and were making their way toward the ancient teleportation formation.<br>&ldquo;Some words of warning, don&rsquo;t even think of sneaking away. We might be unable to do anything about the Zhuge Clan, but the same can&rsquo;t be said about you,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei suddenly spoke up.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, what&rsquo;s the use of venting your anger on me? I&rsquo;m also angered by the earlier incident too,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren replied.<br>&ldquo;You are no kind soul either,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei spat.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Master Yin Ren sneered.<br>Following that, a voice transmission was relayed to the ears of Chu Feng, Shengguang Baimei, and the others.<br>&ldquo;Since the Zhuge Clan chose to break their promise, they shouldn&rsquo;t blame me for getting nasty. Don&rsquo;t worry, young friend Chu Feng. By hook or by crook, I&rsquo;ll get you into that legacy formation.&rdquo;<br>The crowd was surprised to hear those words, including Princess Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Master Yin Ren, you have an idea in mind?&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao asked.<br>&ldquo;Feign ignorance to it for the time being. The Zhuge Clan is still keeping tabs on us. I&rsquo;ll tell you more about it once we leave this place via the ancient teleportation formation.&rdquo;<br>The group was still in low spirits a moment ago, but Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s words raised their morale. They could tell that Master Yin Ren wasn&rsquo;t joking around.<br>So, they entered the ancient teleportation formation.<br>Moments after they entered the ancient teleportation formation, three figures suddenly appeared in the distant sky. The one leading the group was a gray-haired elder, and behind him were two middle-aged men.<br>They were all elders of the Zhuge Clan.<br>&ldquo;Lord Elder, they are making their way to the Treasure Ordinary Realm now. Should we follow them?&rdquo; one of the middle-aged men asked the gray-haired elder.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that. We can&rsquo;t underestimate their means. They dare not do anything to us in our territory, but once we leave the defensive formation, we&rsquo;ll be the ones to suffer. Besides, they aren&rsquo;t the ones we need to guard against now. Our mission is to stand guard here and inform the clan chief right away if anything happens,&rdquo; the gray-haired elder replied.<br>Weng!<br>Multiple figures dressed in blue robes and blue coronets suddenly appeared from the ancient teleportation formation.<br>Their robes weren&rsquo;t just ordinary robes. They were special world spiritist robes.<br>&ldquo;Lord Elder, look! Are they&hellip;&rdquo;<br>One of the middle-aged men took out a painting. It detailed a blue robe identical to the ones worn by the figures who had just walked out of the ancient teleportation formation.<br></p></div>
