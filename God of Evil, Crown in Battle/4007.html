        <h1>Chapter 4006</h1>
        <div> - Current Cultivation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster acting in such a manner, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s elders and disciples, and even the people from the five great powers, all felt completely bewildered.<br>This was not the way the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster normally behaved.<br>Even when he faced dangers, he had never behaved with such cowardice.<br>After all, the six great powers had worked together multiple times.<br>In their impression, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had always had extraordinary bearing and courage.<br>All aspects regarding him surpassed those of ordinary people.<br>Whenever they encountered problems, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster would always be the main pillar in solving them.<br>Yet at that moment, he was behaving like a completely different person. His change in behavior was so drastic that they didn&rsquo;t even recognize him anymore.<br>With that sort of cowardice and submissiveness, he did not resemble a grand character in the slightest.<br>Because of that, the crowd all turned their eyes to Zhao Hong.<br>They knew that it was because of her that the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster was acting in such a manner.<br>Why would Zhao Hong be able to bring such fear to the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster?<br>Was he feeling remorse in his heart, or could Zhao Hong really be so powerful that she could make the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster not possess even the slightest bit of courage to go against her?<br>Meanwhile, Zhao Hong was also watching the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster attentively.<br>Seeing him disregarding his status and kneeling to beg for forgiveness, she remained completely expressionless, and was not moved in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;Liu Shuo, even if I am able to forgive you, I cannot forgive you on behalf of my father and all the people from the Reincarnation Sect that died.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The sins you&rsquo;ve committed are unforgivable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, I, Zhao Hong, shall represent our Reincarnation Sect and obtain justice from your All-heaven Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, I, Zhao Hong, shall make your All-heaven Sect pay this debt of blood in blood,&rdquo; said Zhao Hong.<br>As her cold voice sounded, everyone could feel a sense of chilliness engulfing them.<br>No, that was not a sense of chilliness. Rather, it was an ice-cold and bone-chilling killing intent.<br>Zhao Hong did not plan to spare Liu Shuo. Instead, she had decided to unleash her attack.<br>A blue sword appeared in her hand. It was an Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>The Incomplete Exalted Armament moved with Zhao Hong&rsquo;s arm and slashed down in midair.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Then, sword energy visible to the naked eye cleaved through the air and streaked across the sky shooting straight for the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>Seeing the incoming attack from Zhao Hong, even the leaders of the five major powers that were near the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster immediately moved away, distancing themselves from him.<br>Many bystanders also left their viewing platforms and fled far into the sky to avoid the battle.<br>None of them wanted to lose their lives there.<br>That said, although Zhao Hong&rsquo;s sword energy was very powerful, it suddenly dissipated upon approaching the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>An Incomplete Exalted Armament had appeared in the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster&rsquo;s hand.<br>He had used that sword to block Zhao Hong&rsquo;s attack.<br>It was a silver sword with a golden dragon.<br>The golden dragon coiled around the sword. Because of that, the sword&rsquo;s edge was not sharp at all.<br>However, weapons at the Incomplete Exalted Armament level were no longer weapons where their forms could determine their power. The most important aspect was the power contained within the weapon itself.<br>Because of that, Incomplete Exalted Armaments not only possessed souls, but they also possessed extraordinary imposing airs.<br>Judging from their imposing airs, it seemed that the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster&rsquo;s Incomplete Exalted Armament far surpassed Zhao Hong&rsquo;s.<br>His Incomplete Exalted Armament was a top quality weapon even amongst all top quality Incomplete Exalted Armaments.<br>Zhao Hong&rsquo;s Incomplete Exalted Armament, on the other hand, was merely an ordinary Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>There was an intense disparity between the two weapons.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the All-heaven Dragon Sword.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s strongest Incomplete Exalted Armament.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the Incomplete Exalted Armament in Liu Shuo&rsquo;s hand, cries of alarm from the people of the All-heaven Starfield sounded from all directions.<br>Reverence actually filled their voices. From this, it could be seen that the sword held by the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster was no small matter.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the air started to oscillate. Boundless oppressive might swept forth.<br>It was the sword Zhao Hong held in her hand.<br>That blue sword was originally akin to ice.<br>However, white runes and symbols had appeared on the body of the sword.<br>The runes and symbols started shining. They appeared very mysterious and strange.<br>When the runes and symbols appeared, the aura emitted by the sword had changed completely.<br>At that moment, only two different sorts of powers could be felt in the surrounding heaven and earth.<br>One came from the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster&rsquo;s All-heaven Dragon Sword.<br>As for the other, it came from Zhao Hong&rsquo;s blue-runed sword.<br>Zhao Hong&rsquo;s sword, which had appeared completely ordinary before, suddenly had an aura no weaker than Liu Shuo&rsquo;s All-heaven Dragon Sword.<br>&ldquo;That&hellip; that sword. Could it be&hellip;?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistake, that is most definitely&hellip; that sword.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the long-lost treasure of the Reincarnation Sect, the Reincarnation Rune Sword!&rdquo;<br>Seeing the sword in Zhao Hong&rsquo;s hand, some of the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s older generations exclaimed in admiration.<br>Perhaps the people of the current generation had never heard of the sword.<br>However, the people of the older generation knew it very well.<br>Back then, there was a weapon in the All-heaven Starfield that could match the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sect protection treasure, the All-heaven Dragon Sword equally. That sword was the Reincarnation Sect&rsquo;s sect protection treasure, the Reincarnation Rune Sword.<br>After the battle back then, the Reincarnation Rune Sword had disappeared, and had been lost ever since.<br>Originally, people thought that the All-heaven Sect had decided to stash the sword.<br>Never had they expected it to appear in Zhao Hong&rsquo;s hand at that moment.<br>In other words, the long-lost sword had not been taken away by the All-heaven Sect.<br>Rather, it had been hidden by the Reincarnation Sect, hidden by Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a burst of laughter shattered everyone&rsquo;s train of thought.<br>That laughter came from the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>Looking over, the crowd discovered that the kneeling All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had stood back up.<br>He was holding the All-heaven Dragon Sword with one hand, holding his forehead with his other hand, and laughing with his head facing the sky.<br>His current appearance was a complete contrast to the kneeling person from earlier.<br>Not only did his imposing aura return to him, but he also appeared to be much more crazed than before.<br>&ldquo;He&hellip; what&rsquo;s going on with him?&rdquo;<br>Many people were confused by the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster&rsquo;s erratic change in behavior.<br>Suddenly, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster withdrew his smile and stopped laughing. He looked to Zhao Hong.<br>At that moment, the fear that had been present in his eyes earlier had disappeared completely.<br>Instead, his eyes were now brimming with rage and killing intent.<br>&ldquo;Zhao Hong, oh Zhao Hong, it would appear that the battle from back then left quite a large amount of damage to you too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the blink of an eye, so many years have passed. I thought that with your talent, even if you didn&rsquo;t become a Martial Exalted, you would have at least reached peak Utmost Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that you would, like me, only be a rank four Utmost Exalted.&rdquo;<br>Once he said those words, the crowd all came to a sudden realization.<br>The reason he was so afraid earlier was because he knew how talented Zhao Hong was.<br>He'd thought that since she had survived and it had been so many years since then, she must&rsquo;ve reached a level of cultivation he could not contend against.<br>However, when Zhao Hong had attacked earlier, she had revealed her actual cultivation.<br>Rank four Utmost Exalted. That was Zhao Hong&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>Facing such a cultivation, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster was no longer afraid.<br></p></div>
