        <div>: Clearing the Trial<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Song Yun and Elder Yunkong left the Incubation Forest to head for a remote location to speak to one another.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve really grown up. I couldn&rsquo;t recognize you at all. How is your mother doing?&rdquo;<br>Elder Yunkong&rsquo;s attitude toward Song Yun was very different from before.<br>If he had taken on a cold and lofty attitude before her earlier on, at this very moment, he was looking at Song Yun amicably, reminiscent of a kind elder looking at a junior whom he favored.<br>&ldquo;My mother is still the same as always. But elder, you seem to be very favored by the Wretched Black Demon?&rdquo;<br>As soon as Song Yun said those words, she immediately realized that she had misspoken. So, she quickly covered her mouth before correcting herself, &ldquo;My bad, it should be Lord Black Demon instead&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. We&rsquo;re a family, so there&rsquo;s no need for you to watch your words before me. I was still wondering who is so formidable as to be able to use martial power within Lord Black Demon&rsquo;s formation, but if the person is you, it&rsquo;s completely understandable,&rdquo; Dongfang Yunkong replied with a chuckle.<br>&ldquo;Elder, now that you have noticed me, wouldn&rsquo;t you be in a bad position if you were to let me off like that?&rdquo; Song Yun asked.<br>She knew that infringing on the rules set by the Wretched Black Demon was a severe crime. If she were to leave just like that, she would be putting Dongfang Yunkong in trouble.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I can just say that I failed to capture you. Since you have the ability to use your martial power in the formation, it shouldn&rsquo;t come as too much of a surprise that you were able to evade my pursuit. Besides, I have been turning a blind eye to the dirty stuff that they have been doing all this while,&rdquo; Dongfang Yunkong remarked.<br>&ldquo;Elder, it looks like you&rsquo;re aware that the juniors of the Gongsun Clan are cheating in the trial too. I didn&rsquo;t think that you would let that matter be. It isn&rsquo;t like you to let them get away with that,&rdquo; Song Yun asked in surprise.<br>&ldquo;Things are different from before. If you wish to survive in a new environment, you&rsquo;ll have to adapt to the rules of that place.&rdquo;<br>There was a slight hint of bitterness on Dongfang Yunkong&rsquo;s lips, which made Song Yun realize that he wasn&rsquo;t having an easy time here either.<br>&ldquo;Elder, why torture yourself if you know that this place isn&rsquo;t suited for you?&rdquo; Song Yun asked.<br>&ldquo;I owe Lord Black Demon a favor, and it&rsquo;s only natural for me to repay him. Yun&rsquo;er, if there&rsquo;s nothing else, you should leave right now. I need to hurry back, or else I won&rsquo;t be able to account for it,&rdquo; Dongfang Yunkong said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, can you do me a favor?&rdquo; Song Yun asked.<br>&ldquo;What favor? Feel free to speak.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Please help me take care of a person. It&rsquo;s that man whom I was traveling with.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You mean that world spiritist of the Asura Realm? It looks like the two of you are quite close to one another. Alright, I&rsquo;ll try my best to protect him. As long as he doesn&rsquo;t enter the Asura Graveyard, I should be able to ensure his safety. However, if he were to insist on entering that place, I&rsquo;m afraid that there&rsquo;s nothing much I can do about it,&rdquo; Dongfang Yunkong replied.<br>&ldquo;Elder, do you mean to say that the matchmaking convention has trials where the challengers will have to enter the Asura Graveyard?&rdquo; Song Yun asked with a deep frown.<br>The reputation of the Asura Graveyard was not just for show. Song Yun didn&rsquo;t wantChu Feng to take a risk and enter such a place.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Lord Black Demon does have such plans in mind. However, I&rsquo;m not too sure about the details either. If you don&rsquo;t want him to enter the Asura Graveyard, I can help you talk to him later on.&rdquo;<br>Dongfang Yunkong was able to see through Song Yun&rsquo;s worries.<br>&ldquo;Forget it. If he really wants to enter the Asura Graveyard, leave him be. I can&rsquo;t possibly make his decisions for him. Elder, I&rsquo;m really thankful for your help today. I shall leave right now so as to not add to your troubles.&rdquo;<br>Song Yun clasped her fist toward Dongfang Yunkong before preparing to take her leave.<br>&ldquo;Yun&rsquo;er, when you meet your mother, please relay to her that I, Dongfang Yunkong, remember the grace she has shown me. If a day comes where she needs my help, she just has to send word over, and I&rsquo;ll brave through danger for her without blinking my eyelids,&rdquo; Dongfang Yunkong said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I&rsquo;ll definitely relay your words to my mother.&rdquo;<br>Song Yun nodded with a smile before quickly leaving the area.<br>&hellip;<br>In the Incubation Forest, inside a cavern beyond the stone door, Chu Feng had already arrived at the very heart of the spirit formation gate.<br>It took him a bit of effort, but he managed to take control of the formation in the end. Nevertheless, he still carried a sliver of worry in his heart.<br>He felt that everything had gone too smoothly that it felt unnatural to him.<br>He had indeed taken the lead in this trial through using Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, but it was weird how no one discovered the spirit formation gate even though he took so long to take control of the formation. This didn&rsquo;t make sense at all.<br>One must know that the three prodigies of the Gongsun Clan were all world spiritists at rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation. Given their backgrounds and strength, even if it would take them a little longer, they should still be able to find the spirit formation gate without too much trouble.<br>Hong long long!<br>It was then that the formation began whirring into action, causing a spirit formation gate to form in front of him.<br>&ldquo;Has the trial come to an end? Does that mean that someone has managed to take control over the other two spirit formation gates?&rdquo;<br>The current situation was telling Chu Feng that the second trial for the slot to participate in the matchmaking convention had come to an end. As soon as the spirit formation gate was formed, a surge of unique energy swiftly suffused the gate, making it such that only the controller of the formation was able to enter it.<br>Chu Feng quickly entered the spirit formation gate, and in the next moment, he found that he had already walked out of the Incubation Forest. He had returned back to the entrance to the forest once more.<br>There was a huge crowd gathered before him. There were the elders who had been guarding the entrance to the Incubation Forest earlier, as well as many junior world spiritists too.<br>It was just that those junior world spiritists found themselves at a loss of word upon seeing Chu Feng. There were incredulous looks on their faces, and even the elders were in a state of disbelief as well.<br>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t pay too much heed to their responses. Instead, he shot a glance at his sides.<br>On his left and right, there were two other spirit formation gates, and two figures had stepped out from within.<br>&ldquo;This is&hellip;&rdquo;<br>However, upon seeing the two of them, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up in surprise.<br>There was no doubt that those who had stepped out from the spirit formation gates were those who had cleared the trial, but astonishingly, none of the three of them, including Chu Feng, was from the Gongsun Clan.<br></p></div>
