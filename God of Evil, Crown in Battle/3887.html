        <div> - Saints Captured<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>The Great Monster Slayer Emperor raised his arm. The Great Monster Slaying Sword he held in his hand was tossed into the air.<br>Following that, the Great Monster Slaying Sword, the four martial skill scrolls, and the blue gem containing spirit power all floated toward Chu Feng, and began to slowly revolve around him.<br>&ldquo;This feeling?&rdquo;<br>After those items began to revolve around him, Chu Feng felt a peculiar aura.<br>&ldquo;These things are the inheritances this old man has prepared for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although there&rsquo;s not many things, they are definitely not things that the treasures outside can compare to.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At the very least, they suit the current you greatly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, as to whether or not you can obtain them is not up to this old man. Instead, it&rsquo;ll depend on whether or not you&rsquo;ll be able to obtain their acknowledgement.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend, to you, this will be the final trial.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whether or not you&rsquo;ll succeed will depend on your own ability.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>After the Great Monster Slaying Emperor said those words, Chu Feng felt that the power that had enveloped him suddenly increased manifold.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng did not dare to hesitate, and immediately closed his eyes to wholeheartedly fuse with that power.<br>Chu Feng knew that should he be able to completely fuse with that power, he would&rsquo;ve received their acknowledgement.<br>As the power fused with Chu Feng, he began to fuse with the spirit formation of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>He felt as if he had entered the formation core.<br>Chu Feng was able to observe certain things happening in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>In fact, Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power was even able to shuttle through the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>Chu Feng even felt that if he wanted to, not only would his spirit power be able to move throughout the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb at will, but even his body would be able to leave that place, and reach any location in the vicinity of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb following his consciousness.<br>Regardless of whether that place might be inside the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb or outside, he would be able to reach it in an instant.<br>However, Chu Feng could not do that. If he did, he would lose his link with the power that he was fusing with.<br>Should that happen, Chu Feng would naturally fail to obtain the inheritance.<br>That said, after obtaining the special power, Chu Feng wanted to use it to observe those Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms.<br>However, Chu Feng discovered that he was simply unable to reach the cave those Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms lived in.<br>His consciousness could only travel about inside and outside in the vicinity of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>&ldquo;That is?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart tensed up.<br>He saw several figures engaged in a battle.<br>He was unable to see the appearances of those people, as there was sacred light revolving around their bodies.<br>However, Chu Feng recognized those bodies of light. Thus, he knew that those people were the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>The current Mystic Cave Saints possessed enormous power. They were currently surrounding and attacking a single person with their enormous power.<br>Chu Feng did not know that person. However, that person not only had a strange appearance, but was also extremely powerful. With every wave of the horsetail whisk in his hand, blood-red gaseous flames would be released.<br>The blood-red gaseous flames were extremely powerful. Before them, the Mystic Cave Saints were actually retreating constantly.<br>&ldquo;Who is that person?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How come he also possesses the power of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb&rsquo;s spirit formation?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt extremely astonished.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell that the reason why the weird-looking, horsetail whisk-holding man possessed such great power was because he had also grasped the power of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>He was relying on the power of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb to suppress the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>But, why would the power of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb he possessed be stronger than that of the Mystic Cave Saints?<br>&ldquo;Is it that horsetail whisk?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He obtained such overwhelming power because of that horsetail whisk?&rdquo;<br>Ultimately, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze landed on that horsetail whisk. Chu Fent felt that horsetail whisk to be the cause of everything. Likely, that individual had obtained the power of the tomb&rsquo;s spirit formation due to that horsetail whisk.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>In the time when Chu Feng was pondering such things, the Mystic Cave Saints were all defeated.<br>After the Mystic Cave Saints were defeated, their opponent swung his horsetail whisk, and a stream of blood-red gaseous flames turned into an enormous palm that grabbed all of the Mystic Cave Saints lying on the ground, arresting all of them.<br>Following that, that individual began to walk out of the tomb, bringing the Mystic Cave Saints with him.<br>&ldquo;Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, we&rsquo;ve already suffered greatly from what happened before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, we brothers do not owe you anything. Why must you insist on attacking us still?&rdquo; asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s merely business. You all should understand why this Exalted is doing this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you want to blame something, you would have to blame yourselves for being unfortunate enough to encounter this Exalted.&rdquo;<br>That individual let out an eerie laughter. His laughter was filled with mockery and ridicule.<br>&ldquo;Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted?&rdquo;<br>Through their conversation, Chu Feng learned the identity of that individual.<br>With the situation being like that, Chu Feng no longer had any heart to bother with observing other places. His gaze was completely focused on that Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, and the Mystic Cave Saints he had captured.<br>Soon, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted left the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb and arrived outside.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng saw the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s army.<br>At the same time, he also saw the other people from the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>It turned out that everyone from the Mystic Cave Saints had been captured by the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>Furthermore, the ones that had been captured earlier all had their bodies pierced through by blood-red pillars, pinning them to the ground.<br>&ldquo;This bastard!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng gnashed his teeth furiously upon seeing that scene. At the same time, he became very restless.<br>Although he didn&rsquo;t know exactly what had happened, Chu Feng knew from the looks of things that the Mystic Cave Saints were going to suffer disastrously.<br>In fact, they might even face fatal danger.<br>&ldquo;Mystic Cave Saints, exactly where did you all hide the treasures?&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a Supreme Elder of the All-heaven Sect stepped forward.<br>They had been searching the arrested Mystic Cave Saints whilst the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted went to capture the rest of them.<br>They&rsquo;d searched through all of the Cosmos Sacks and clothes of the arrested Mystic Cave Saints.<br>Yet, not only was there no sign of their treasures that were robbed by the Mystic Cave Saints, but the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; Cosmos Sacks were also only filled with junk, and no treasure at all.<br>&ldquo;Their treasures should be hidden within their bodies.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mystic Cave Saints, are you all going to take out your treasures yourselves, or does this Exalted need to do it for you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If this Exalted is to do it for you, I&rsquo;m afraid that you will not be able to avoid suffering,&rdquo; said the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Humph. If you&rsquo;re capable, then give it a try. As long as we&rsquo;re unwilling to take out the treasures, even if you are to kill us, you will still not be able to find the treasures,&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Since you all wish to suffer, don't blame this Exalted for being ruthless.&rdquo;<br>As the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted spoke, he waved his horsetail whisk again.<br>Then, a large amount of blood-red gaseous flames were released from the horsetail whisk. They soon turned into countless sharp blades that floated in midair. Those blades seemed to be intending to pierce into the bodies of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, Tuoba Chengan suddenly called for a halt.<br>&ldquo;Mystic Cave Saints, we have no grievance with you all. I know that you all only decided to rob our treasures and make yourselves our enemies under that Asura&rsquo;s instructions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about this: as long as you tell us where that Asura is and return the treasures you robbed from us, we will consider it as if nothing happened between us, and let you all go,&rdquo; said Tuoba Chengan.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart tensed up.<br>He suddenly realized that the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; capture seemed to be related to him.<br>In the next moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart started to tremble violently. Then, a feeling of sourness filled his heart.<br>The reason for that was because of what the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints said.<br>&ldquo;It is true that we, the Mystic Cave Saints, value treasures as much as our lives. For the sake of obtaining treasures, we&rsquo;ve done a few wicked and immoral things.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, we, the Mystic Cave Saints, have a baseline too. Although we&rsquo;ve only known brother Asura for a short period of time, we will definitely not betray him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is our own incompetence to end up being arrested by you all today. We accept our fates.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Kill or torture, do as you wish.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if you think that we will betray our brother, then you&rsquo;re truly looking down on us Mystic Cave Saints.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
