        <div> - Absurd Excuse<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Ying Mingchao, I know that you have a very deep prejudice toward our Infant Soul Sect. However, there really is no need for us to face one another with swords and blades drawn,&rdquo; The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said to Ying Mingchao.<br>Compared to Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s overflowing killing intent, this Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster actually had a calm and relaxed expression on his face.<br>It was as if he was not facing a life and death battle, but rather a friend.<br>&ldquo;Prejudice? Is what you all have done just prejudice?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you to tell me that the deaths of all those innocent infants is merely prejudice?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those were children that had not even managed to witness this world! How could you all be so ruthless as to kill them?!&rdquo; Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s furious voice echoed in this region.<br>It was so resounding and powerful!!!<br>&ldquo;Infant Soul Sect, death will not wipe away your crimes. You all shall be dismembered into ten thousand pieces and consigned to eternal damnation.&rdquo;<br>Following that, the people present all began to speak out against the Infant Soul Sect. After all, what the Infant Soul Sect had done was indeed something that many people found unacceptable.<br>&ldquo;I admit that what our Infant Soul Sect has done is wrong. However, if I am to tell you all that our Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s actions were done to benefit everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, would you all be able to understand me?&rdquo; The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;What? Benefit everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. What a joke!&rdquo;<br>Before Ying Mingchao could even say anything, the surrounding crowd immediately let out disdainful voices.<br>This was the most absurd thing that they had ever heard.<br>This was simply an insult to their intelligence. That Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was simply treating them as fools.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as I said, you all won&rsquo;t necessarily believe me. However, that is the truth,&rdquo; The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;What utter absurdity!&rdquo; Ying Mingchao was extremely furious, and did not feel like bothering with superfluous words. Thus, he pulled out his weapon and planned to attack.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; Right at this moment, the Immortal Sword School&rsquo;s Headmaster stopped Ying Mingchao. He said, &ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t possibly have lured us here without a reason. We should hear what they have to say and see what tricks they still have, and what their goal is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do as you wish,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao spoke coldly.<br>He was annoyed. Ying Mingchao felt that there was simply no need to bother with superfluous words against an existence like the Infant Soul Sect. He felt that it would be better to just exterminate them directly.<br>That said, he was still was currently a member of the allied army. Furthermore, the Immortal Sword School&rsquo;s Headmaster was also a rank two True Immortal, and an ally. Thus&hellip; he would have to take his proposals into consideration.<br>&ldquo;Infant Soul Sect, do not blame me for not giving you all a chance. Since you all want to speak, I will allow you all to speak all to properly explain yourselves.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I shall see exactly what sort of trick you all can play,&rdquo; The Immortal Sword Sect&rsquo;s Headmaster said to the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;The vast Outer World is filled with countless worlds. While we are unable to compare to the Upper Realms, when compared to the various Ordinary Realms, our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm is still weak.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That deeply vexed the founder of our Infant Soul Sect. He was distressed by thoughts of how to increase the overall strength of everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm for his entire life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the way of martial cultivation places great importance upon one&rsquo;s own comprehension. To increase the overall strength of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm is an extremely difficult task. In fact, it could even be said to be simply impossible.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the heavens smile upon determined individuals. Our Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s founder managed to run into a fortuitous encounter. From that fortuitous encounter, he discovered a method to forcibly imbue others with martial comprehension, a method to help others increase their cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, it is an extremely long process to achieve that method. Furthermore, an enormous price must be paid.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is, one will have to use the lives of newborn infants to temper that method. Through various tempering processes and experiments, one will finally be able to achieve it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s founder knew very well that our Infant Soul Sect would most definitely be detested by everyone in the world, and viewed as an enemy the moment we implemented that method.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, before we achieved our results, no one would know that we were doing all this to benefit the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, to benefit our descendants.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, for the sake of our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm&rsquo;s future generations, for the sake of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm&rsquo;s future, some sacrifices are necessary. For that, our Infant Soul Sect was formed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All these years, our Infant Soul Sect has repeatedly been the target of scorn and attacks by so-called righteous sects and powers. Countless brothers of our Infant Soul Sect have been killed or injured. Yet, we continued on. While being detested by you all, we continued on doing what is beneficial to you all and your descendants,&rdquo; The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;Shut your mouth!!!&rdquo; Right at this moment, Zi Xunyi suddenly shouted.<br>At this moment, Zi Xunyi was so furious that she started shivering. She pointed to the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster and spoke with overwhelming anger, &ldquo;You all have killed so many innocent children, yet you dare to find such pompous justification for your actions. You all are simply degenerates detested by both humans and gods. You all are simply lower than dogs and pigs.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Zi Xunyi looked to Ying Mingchao. She said, &ldquo;Mingchao, do not bother with superfluous words with them anymore. Do not allow them to continue on with their nonsense. Eliminate them all. We cannot allow this bunch of animals to continue living. We cannot allow them to harm innocent lives again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, kill them!!!&rdquo;<br>Once Zi Xunyi said those words, both the allied army as well as the bystanders echoed in agreement.<br>They all deeply detested the Infant Soul Sect to begin with. And now, the Infant Soul Sect actually gave such a justification for themselves. This had completely enraged them.<br>At this moment, the tens of thousands of people were all shouting in unison. They all had a common desire, the desire to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect.<br>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t happen again!!!&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, that Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster spoke again. His voice was so loud that it actually drowned out the shouts of the tens of thousands of people.<br>In fact, when he spoke, both space and the earth started to shake. Buzzing noises accompanied constant trembles.<br>At this moment, everyone closed their mouths. The strength of a rank two True Immortal had brought fear upon many of the people present here.<br>After all, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was an existence that could completely obliterate them, leaving not even a corpse or skeleton behind, with a mere thought.<br>&ldquo;We will no longer go and cause the death of another innocent infant. The reason for that is because we have, after many years of effort, finally succeeded. We have successfully grasped the method to increase everyone&rsquo;s cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We have invited everyone here precisely so that we can reveal to everyone, reveal to the people of our Hundred Refments Ordinary Realm, our achievement.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I also know that my words possess no basis to lean on, and that everyone will simply not believe me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However&hellip; when the truth is placed before your eyes, you all will definitely believe it, believe what I have said to not be lies, to not be complete nonsense, but rather the truth, believe that I have not deceived everyone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I will demonstrate to the fellow citizens of our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm the results that our Infant Soul Sect has gained after sacrificing countless newborn infants.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come, allow them to all experience the power of the Infant Soul Great Formation!!!&rdquo;<br>After the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said those words, he began to form a hand seal.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, a black gaseous flame appeared on the bodies of everyone from the Infant Soul Sect. The black gaseous flames started to interweave with one another and form a grand formation in the sky.<br>This grand formation was different from anything anyone had ever seen before. It was not an ordinary spirit formation. Rather, it was a formation formed by the heinous air emitted by all the people from the Infant Soul Sect.<br>&ldquo;That formation!!!&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing that formation, the expressions of many people changed. They were all intimidated by the vast imposing might of that formation.<br>&ldquo;I believe everyone knows the Chen Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. He reached peak Martial Ancestor over a thousand years ago. However, even after all these years, he has not been able to reach the True Immortal realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, right now&hellip; I will assist him in reaching a breakthrough in cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone, watch carefully. For you will all serve as witnesses to this miracle.&rdquo;<br>As the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster spoke, with a thought, black energy emerged from the grand formation. That energy surrounded the Chen Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh, wuuahh, wuuahh~~~~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, the Chen Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief began to scream miserably.<br>However, what caused the crowd&rsquo;s blood to run cold was the fact that when he screamed, they could also hear the wailing cries of infants.<br>Those were countless wailing cries of infants. They were being emitted from the Chen Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. However, those wailing cries were clearly not the voice of the Chen Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>At this moment, many people present started to tremble in fear from the aura of that grand formation and those infant cries.<br><br></p></div>
