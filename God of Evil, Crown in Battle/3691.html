        <div> - The Strongest Immortal Technique<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s body began to emit a faint white light.<br>The faint white light turned into very thin armor on top of Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s clothes.<br>After the armor of light appeared, Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s cultivation increased again to rank five Exalted.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng did not hesitate, and immediately released his Lightning Armor to increase his cultivation.<br>After all, only by increasing his cultivation would he be able to contend against Chu Lingxi.<br>That said, Chu Feng was shaken.<br>The armor on Chu Lingxi was very strange. Although it contained the power of a treasure, that was not all the armor was made of. There was also a bloodline power present in that armor.<br>That bloodline power was not a Heavenly Bloodline. It was a bloodline&rsquo;s power that Chu Feng had never felt before.<br>&ldquo;Girl, what is that on your body?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Haha. Big brother Chu Feng, are you surprised?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m wearing is my Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;s treasure, the Ancient Clan&rsquo;s Inner Armor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This Ancient Clan&rsquo;s Inner Armor can only be activated through our Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;s bloodline power. After it is activated, it will increase one&rsquo;s battle power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for me, I am more amazing than ordinary people. Instead of only increasing my battle power, I am able to increase my cultivation by an entire level.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you know how I managed to increase my cultivation by leaps and bounds in such a short period of time?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because my Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;s bloodline was suppressed by my mother using a secret technique the moment I was born.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Upon my return to the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, my bloodline was released through a special formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, the reason why my cultivation increased so much was not due to my talent. Instead, it is because of my Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;s bloodline,&rdquo; said Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;So, girl, you possess the powers of two bloodlines?&rdquo; Chu Feng came to a sudden realization.<br>It turned out that it wasn&rsquo;t that Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s talent was insufficient, it was instead that her talent was suppressed.<br>This was not a transformation. Instead, it was an awakening. She had finally awakened the power that belonged to her.<br>It was no wonder her cultivation would increase in such a dazzling manner.<br>Speaking of it, even Chu Feng felt slightly envious.<br>It was indeed extremely fortunate to possess the power of two bloodlines at birth.<br>&ldquo;Hehe. I know that I am definitely no match for you should I fight you using just my Heavenly Bloodline. After all, you are trained in the strongest mysterious technique for Heavenly Bloodlines, the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, a Heavenly Bloodline is not all that I possess.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, big brother Chu Feng, you must not be careless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>After her words left her mouth, Chu Lingxi unleashed her attack. This time around, her attacks grew particularly fierce.<br>Her legs gave birth to wind and created countless clones in the sky, which all rushed to attack Chu Feng at the same time.<br>She was no longer fighting Chu Feng using purely her sword techniques. Instead, she had used an Immortal Technique.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng did not hesitate, and also used an Immortal Technique in response.<br>The two of them fought back and forth, and their attacks grew stronger and stronger.<br>However, in the end, they were still at a stalemate...<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, if you cannot withstand my following attack, say so quickly.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Lingxi stopped attacking Chu Feng and moved backwards.<br>&ldquo;This girl?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze changed.<br>After Chu Lingxi activated the bloodline power of her Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, she had been emitting a faint white light the entire time.<br>However, the faint light light on her body had now changed. It became even more sacred-looking.<br>Then, a bright light appeared atop Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s head.<br>The light shone brightly, illuminating her surroundings in a sacred radiance.<br>From that sacred light, Chu Feng was able to sense an enormous power.<br>&ldquo;Could it be, is this the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;s rank nine Immortal Technique, Ancient Clan&rsquo;s Holy Halo?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistake, this is the Ancient Clan&rsquo;s Holy Halo!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My goodness, that&rsquo;s one of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s strongest rank nine Immortal Techniques!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s said that the Ancient Clan&rsquo;s Holy Halo is extremely difficult to master, so much so that many of the elders of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan still haven&rsquo;t mastered it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Lingxi, with how young she is, actually managed to grasp such a powerful Immortal Technique?&rdquo;<br>Many people began to exclaim in admiration. The Ancient Clan&rsquo;s Holy Halo was simply too renowned.<br>&ldquo;Rumble, rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, thunder exploded in the sky as crimson, blood-red clouds gathered.<br>Half of the surroundings that were originally fully covered by the sacred light were dyed bloody red.<br>It was Chu Feng&rsquo;s Immortal Taboo Martial Skill: Blood Lightning Technique.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell how powerful Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s rank nine Immortal Technique was.<br>He felt a much greater threat from Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s Ancient Clan&rsquo;s Holy Halo than Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s rank nine Immortal Technique, so much so that Chu Feng did not even possess certainty of victory when using the strongest technique he currently had, the Immortal Taboo: Blood Lightning Technique.<br></p></div>
