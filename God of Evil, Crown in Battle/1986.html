        <div> - Emergence Of The Moon Demon<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>As for Chu Feng, he specifically targeted the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts. The reason for that was because he knew that the people from the Dark Hall were only able to suppress the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves because of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts.<br>As for those Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts, they were very powerful. Especially those rank six Martial Emperor Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts, ordinary rank six Martial Emperors were no match for them. However, Chu Feng possessed confidence in being able to kill them.<br>&ldquo;Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom~~~&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng collided against that bunch of fierce Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts. Furthermore, he was fighting against many by himself.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, be careful. Those Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts are exceptionally fierce,&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng had challenged that many Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts by himself, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves started to worry about Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety. The reason for that was because they had suffered numerous casualties from those Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts.<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts were different from the ferocious beasts in the Holy Land of Martialism. Although they did not possess any intelligence, they were equipped with fighting techniques and special powers. They were simply akin to natural born wild fighting demons and were extremely difficult to take care of.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after Chu Feng began fighting against the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts, several Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts began to emit miserable cries as they were killed by Chu Feng.<br>Suddenly, not to mention the people from the Dark Hall, even the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves who were worried for Chu Feng were struck dumb.<br>It was one thing for Chu Feng to easily kill rank four and rank five Martial Emperor-level Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts. However, of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts that he had just killed, one was a rank six Martial Emperor.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng did not hold back his strength, and had instead gone all-out. Thus, everyone managed to sense Chu Feng&rsquo;s actual cultivation and his heaven-defying battle power.<br>Furthermore, the weapon in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand was an Imperial Armament. However, that Imperial Armament was exceptionally powerful. Furthermore, why was its shape so familiar?<br>&ldquo;Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader. That Imperial Armament little friend Chu Feng holds in his hand, could it be that legendary Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader?&rdquo; After observing Chu Feng&rsquo;s weapon, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal cried out in shock.<br>&ldquo;Weaponry Refinement Immortal, you are correct. What little friend Chu Feng holds in his hand is indeed the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader used by the Beast Emperor,&rdquo; The Snow Blade Mad Demon said with a loud voice.<br>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; After hearing what the Snow Blade Mad Demon said, many people sucked in a mouthful of cold air uncontrollably. They did not expect that Chu Feng would actually possess a legendary Imperial Armament.<br>Suddenly, no one was worried for Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety anymore. The reason for that was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength had increased. He was currently a rank two Martial Emperor. Using his special lightning power, he had increased his cultivation to rank four Martial Emperor. Adding on his heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation, Chu Feng was extremely frightening.<br>Furthermore, he actually possessed a legendary Imperial Armament, the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader. With that, Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength was simply overwhelmingly heaven-defying.<br>Likely, there would not be anyone underneath rank seven Martial Emperor who could defeat Chu Feng. Not to mention bringing over a thousand Martial Emperors with him, it was likely that Chu Feng himself would be able to turn the battle around.<br>&ldquo;Tsk, tsk, tsk. That little bastard Chu Feng is quite interesting,&rdquo; At that moment, the World Devastator Immortal&rsquo;s son was also focused on Chu Feng. A cold smile appeared on his face.<br>&ldquo;Kill Chu Feng!&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng was wantonly killing the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts, the people from the Dark Hall grew anxious. Those rank seven Martial Emperors and rank six Martial Emperors among them all began to think of ways to escape their own battles to kill Chu Feng.<br>Unfortunately, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; peak experts refused to give them a chance to break free. Earlier, it was them who had been curbing the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; peak experts the entire time. This was what led to the others from the Dark Hall being able to massacre the rest of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves with the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts.<br>And now, it was finally their turn to massacre the crowd from the Dark Hall. Yet, these Dark Hall&rsquo;s experts actually wanted to rescue the others? Naturally, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; experts would not give them the chance to do so.<br>Suddenly, Luan Jie shouted excitedly, &ldquo;All of you, stand down. That Chu Feng is mine. I&rsquo;ll take care of him myself.&rdquo; Then, he turned into a ray of light and flew toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Where are you escaping to?!&rdquo; Seeing that, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and that Elf Protector hurriedly charged forth to stop Luan Jie with their Imperial Armaments.<br>The two of them knew very well how strong Luan Jie was. Even though Chu Feng had become extremely powerful, he was still definitely not a match for Luan Jie. They could not allow Luan Jie to approach Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Two persistent fellows. Did the two of you really think that you could stop me? I&rsquo;ll kill you two first,&rdquo; Luan Jie revealed a ferocious gaze. He shouted, and then purple light began to emit from his body. In an instant, violent wind began to surge with lightning striking about. Soon, a purple spear appeared in the sky.<br>That spear came striking down from above the moment it appeared and brought an enormous amount of pressure to the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and that Elf Protector. It turned out that Luan Jie was actually a Divine Body. Furthermore, his Divine Power was extremely frightening.<br>It could be said that his Divine Power was the most frightening one that Chu Feng had seen so far.<br>&ldquo;Ahhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, from the sky, from all around and even from deep underground, an ear-piercing snarl was heard.<br>Once that voice was heard, everyone&rsquo;s bodies started to shiver. They felt as if their hair was standing on end. It was truly too frightening. That voice was truly too frightening. It sounded like the snarl of a malicious spirit, and brought a great sense of intimidation to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Moon Demon, the Moon Demon is awake!&rdquo; Suddenly, the World Devastator Immortal cried out in alarm and revealed an overjoyed expression.<br>&ldquo;Moon Demon? Why would the Moon Demon be awake? The killing formation was clearly broken through and destroyed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, even if the people that entered the killing formation escaped, a lot of Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves and people from the Dark Hall have died. The aura of blood from those people was sufficient to draw out the Moon Demon.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Crap! The Moon Demon has emerged. This is bad!&rdquo; At that moment, Lord Luokong began to frown deeply.<br>Even Chu Feng revealed an expression of unease. The reason for that was because that snarl sounded like a ferocious spirit&rsquo;s snarl, and was filled with killing intent. That was the most frightening sound that Chu Feng had ever heard.<br>Chu Feng felt a premonition that the appearance of the Moon Demon likely signified that all of them would have to suffer a calamity, for that Moon Demon was a very frightening existence.<br>&ldquo;Luan Jie, what are you standing there for? Quickly, go,&rdquo; Right at that moment, the World Devastation Immortal spoke to his son with a stern voice.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured father, when have I ever disappointed you?&rdquo; Luan Jie smiled complacently. At that moment, he was feeling extremely excited.<br>As purple light flickered in his eyes, that enormous purple spear turned into two spears that swept respectively at the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and that Elf Protector.<br>The Weaponry Refinement Immortal and that Elf Protector did not dare to be careless. They both clenched tightly onto the Imperial Armaments which they held and unleashed devastating Heaven Taboo Martial Skills to receive Luan Jie&rsquo;s attack.<br>It was not that the two of them were making a big fuss over a minor issue. Rather, Luan Jie was truly not someone to be looked down upon. If they were to be careless, they would be the ones killed by the spears formed by Luan Jie&rsquo;s Divine Power.<br>&ldquo;Rumble, rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>The two Heaven Taboo Martial Skills used with Imperial Armaments collided with the two spears formed with Divine Power. Violet energy ripples surged violently from their collision. Many people that were very far away from them were also implicated.<br>&ldquo;Crap!&rdquo; At that moment, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal&rsquo;s expression took a huge change.<br>He was shocked to discover that Luan Jie had disappeared after they blocked his attacks. It turned out that Luan Jie&rsquo;s attack from earlier was only bait. His intention was precisely to cast them off of him.<br>After discovering that Luan Jie had disappeared, the first thing that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and that Elf Protector did was rush to Chu Feng. They were most afraid of Luan Jie attacking Chu Feng.<br>However, after they arrived beside Chu Feng, they were surprised to discover that Luan Jie had not attacked Chu Feng. Instead, he had disappeared just like that.<br><br></p></div>
