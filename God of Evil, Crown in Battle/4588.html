        <h1>Chapter 4587</h1>
        <div>: Knocking On Your Doorstep<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, young master Jin&rsquo;an seeks an audience. He says that he has urgent news for you.&rdquo;<br>Just as Shengguang Xuanye was about to get rid of Chu Feng, an elder suddenly shouted outside the cell.<br>Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s gaze turned contemplative for a moment, and in the end, he retracted his killing intent and walked out of the cell.<br>There were many experts of the Holy Light Clan standing outside of the cell. Most of them were advanced in age, which made the junior standing amongst them look extremely conspicuous.<br>This person was no other than Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an.<br>&ldquo;Junior Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an pays respects to Lord Xuanye.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an bowed deeply to Shengguang Xuanye.<br>&ldquo;The rest of you may take your leave.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xuanye waved his hand, indicating for the guards to take their leave. Once everyone was gone, he turned to look at Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an sharply and asked, &ldquo;Jin&rsquo;an, are you intending to plead on Chu Feng&rsquo;s behalf?&rdquo;<br>He had already figured out Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an&rsquo;s intent for coming here.<br>&ldquo;Lord Xuanye, I don&rsquo;t deny that I have met Chu Feng before, but we aren&rsquo;t close with one another. I&rsquo;m not here to plead on his behalf. Rather, I feel that there&rsquo;s something that I ought to inform Lord Xuanye in advance before you make any decisions,&rdquo; Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an said.<br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xuanye eyed Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an in suspicion, not knowing what the latter was up to.<br>&ldquo;Lord Xuanye, I might not be acquainted with Chu Feng, but I know that he has a powerful background. I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s a wise decision for you to get rid of him. If we spare him, there&rsquo;s a chance that our Holy Light Clan might still be able to co-exist with Chu Feng. However, if we were to eliminate him, I fear that danger might fall upon our Holy Light Clan,&rdquo; Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an said.<br>&ldquo;Is that so? Why don&rsquo;t you tell me just what kind of backing Chu Feng has then? I&rsquo;m also interested to know how powerful his background is.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. Despite his calm words, his eyes were like sharp daggers that were threatening to pierce through Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an&rsquo;s chest.<br>However, Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an was not a pushover either. He was able to remain perfectly calm despite Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s attitude toward him.<br>&ldquo;Lord Xuanye, I don&rsquo;t have a deep understanding of Chu Feng myself, but you should consider this. If all Chu Feng had behind him was the Chu Heavenly Clan, how could he possess so many means? He even has an Exalted Armament! It&rsquo;s irrational for an individual to be able to obtain so many valuable treasures on his own,&rdquo; Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an said.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xuanye sneered coldly upon seeing how Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an was unable to state Chu Feng&rsquo;s background clearly despite all of his claims.<br>&ldquo;Jin&rsquo;an, I know that you&rsquo;re acquainted with Chu Feng. I understand your wish to plead on his behalf, but I ask you not to frighten this old heart of mine. If he really has any background, why would he charge here all alone instead of seeking help? He would have never ended in this state in the first place, all helpless and on the verge of death.<br>&ldquo;I do admit that this man does possess some capabilities, such that there&rsquo;s none in our clan who can rival him. However, I believe that the means he possesses are obtained by a stroke of luck, possibly from some remnant he chanced upon.<br>&ldquo;I am, after all, the head of the Holy Light Clan, and I think my decisions through before executing them. I have my own considerations for wanting to eliminate Chu Feng as well. I know that I&rsquo;ll lose Yu&rsquo;er if I were to do this, but there&rsquo;s no other choice. You should have also noticed it too. This man hasn&rsquo;t even matured yet, but there are so many powers who have already sworn allegiance to him.<br>&ldquo;Even the behemoths like the Dragon Clan and the Monstrous Herd Temple are acting on his orders. Do they honestly think Chu Feng is their master? If I let him go, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before this galaxy changes name to the Chu Clan Galaxy!<br>&ldquo;This is also the reason why I have to eliminate him regardless of the cost. Jin&rsquo;an, you are also a member of our Holy Light Clan. Chu Feng might be your friend, but you should prioritize the interest of our clan,&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye said,<br>&ldquo;Lord Xuanye, you are the clan chief of the Holy Light Clan. Your words are our decree. I&rsquo;m only informing you of what I know out of duty. Since you have already come to a decision, I shall take my leave.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an clasped his fist respectfully to Shengguang Xuanye before taking his leave.<br>&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo;<br>After Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an left, Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s eyes turned frostily cold, and he harrumphed coldly. Right after that, the door to the cell opened, and Shengguang Yunyue walked out.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, what do you think young master Jin&rsquo;an means by that? Is he really thinking on behalf of our Holy Light Clan, or is he saying all of this to save Chu Feng? If you insist on executing Chu Feng against young master Jin&rsquo;an&rsquo;s intention, will we incur his displeasure?&rdquo; Shengguang Yunyue asked in a soft voice.<br>Even though she was in the cell earlier, she heard everything loud and clear. Her voice was slightly quivering, seemingly fearful of Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a junior; there&rsquo;s no need to think too much into his thoughts. Do my words weigh less than him now?&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye refuted coldly, his voice carrying a hint of displeasure.<br>&ldquo;No, of course not. Lord Clan Chief, your words are the law in the Holy Light Clan. We only listen to your orders,&rdquo; Shengguang Yunyue quickly replied.<br>Seeing this, Shengguang Xuanye harrumphed coldly. Flinging his sleeves backward, he began making his way back into the cell to end Chu Feng&rsquo;s life for good.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, Supreme Elder, bad news!&rdquo;<br>Trouble seemed to crop up one after another. Several elders suddenly rushed over while exclaiming anxiously.<br>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye asked.<br>&ldquo;A fat monk has suddenly appeared in the Storm Realm. He demands us to release Chu Feng, or else&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The elders suddenly halted their words here, not daring to finish their sentences.<br>&ldquo;Or else what? Speak!&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye bellowed.<br>&ldquo;He says that we are to release Chu Feng right now, or else&hellip; he&rsquo;ll obliterate our Holy Light Clan,&rdquo; the elders replied fearfully.<br>&ldquo;Have you ascertained the identity of that brazen knave?&rdquo; Shengguang Yunyue asked.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an unfamiliar face. I don&rsquo;t think that he&rsquo;s from our Holy Light Galaxy. However, he&rsquo;s an extremely powerful Martial Exalted level cultivator. He has already injured many people in our Holy Light Clan, and even Elder Mulian has fallen in defeat to him. Furthermore&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore what?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Elder Mulian has been captured by him. He says that if we don&rsquo;t release Chu Feng, he&rsquo;ll start off by taking Elder Mulian&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; one of the elders reported.<br>Those words brought a frown to Shengguang Yunyue&rsquo;s forehead as she turned to look at Shengguang Xuanye.<br>While Elder Mulian wasn&rsquo;t a Supreme Elder in the Holy Light Clan, he was still a rank one Martial Exalted level cultivator. The fact that he was defeated and held hostage meant that the monk was not a person whom they could underestimate.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, Supreme Elder, bad news!&rdquo;<br>It was then that even more elders rushed into the room.<br>&ldquo;A white-robed daoist has appeared in our camp. He captured many of our elders and clan members, declaring that he&rsquo;ll destroy our Holy Light Clan if we don&rsquo;t free Chu Feng right now!&rdquo;<br>Those elders who had just rushed in cried out anxiously.<br>And while they were speaking, yet even more elders rushed in a fluster.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, Supreme Elder, bad news!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A beggarly old man is shouting that the Holy Light Clan has framed Chu Feng, and he&rsquo;s demanding that we release Chu Feng and return his innocence! Elder Zhilong has headed over to stop him, but he was injured by that old man!&rdquo;<br>Those elders reported.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>All of this incoming bad news made Shengguang Yunyue&rsquo;s complexion turn darker and darker.<br>The Elder Zhilong that they had mentioned was an expert of the Holy Light Clan as well. Even though he wasn&rsquo;t as strong as Shengguang Yunyue, he was still a match for most Supreme Elders in the Holy Light Clan.<br>One must know that Eler Zhilong was a rank two Martial Exalted level cultivator. The fact that he was defeated meant that the beggarly old man was even stronger than that.<br>Be it the old daoist, the beggarly old man, or the monk, they were all clearly experts on par with the strongest cultivators in the Holy Light Galaxy, and they had all come here for Chu Feng&rsquo;s sake.<br>This realization left Shengguang Yunyue feeling a little flustered.<br>And as fact would have it, even Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s complexion had turned awful as well. At this point in time, it was clear as day that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t as helpless as they thought.<br>All of his friends and allies had come for him, and they were already right at the doorstep of the Holy Light Clan!!!<br></p></div>
