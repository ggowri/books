        <div>: Moment of Glory<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster, your injuries were caused by the torture tools of our Holy Light Clan. Consume this. It&rsquo;ll hasten your recovery.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Buyu walked over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side and passed a pill over to the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thank you, milord.&rdquo;<br>The Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster gratefully received the pill.<br>Even Shengguang Xuanye would have to take a respectful attitude toward someone of Shengguang Buyu&rsquo;s standing. There was no way he would dare to show any disrespect.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, the Revolution Prison is a frightening place that condemns its prisoners to a fate worse than death. If you doubt my words, you may ask the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu said.<br>He wanted to tell Chu Feng that even though they weren&rsquo;t killing Shengguang Xuanye, the punishment they were doling out to him wasn&rsquo;t to be made light of.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right. The Revolution Prison contains 397 torture devices, each one unleashing unbearable pain to its victim. All of these torture devices would be used on each prisoner every single day, that&rsquo;s why the name.<br>&ldquo;Even those prisoners who were able to escape from the Revolution Prison usually end up a little deranged. It&rsquo;s a hellish experience beyond your wildest imagination,&rdquo; the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster quickly explained to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng nodded in response. He was actually satisfied with this outcome.<br>He knew that the Holy Valley only feared him because they thought that he had someone behind him. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have the ability to make them go this far for him.<br>However, he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel guilt-ridden toward the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I&rsquo;ve implicated you this time around.&rdquo;<br>If not for someone protecting Chu Feng from the shadows, he might have very well died in this ordeal. If so, the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster would have also lost his life too.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re too courteous. I&rsquo;ve already had enough of living in fear under Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s rule. You know my personality. If not for you, he&rsquo;d probably still view me as an eyesore. To be honest with you, our Monstrous Herd Temple has been working for the Holy Light Clan all along. It&rsquo;s just that&hellip;&rdquo;<br>It turned out that the Monstrous Herd Temple had been doing tasks for the Holy Light Clan all along. Due to that, the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster had been able to act arrogantly thus far because he knew that the Holy Light Clan needed him.<br>However, the tasks had recently come to an end, thus making the Monstrous Herd Temple useless to the Holy Light Clan.<br>The Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster did consider the possibility that Shengguang Xuanye would target him, but he didn&rsquo;t expect it to happen so quickly. That was the reason why he felt that Shengguang Xuanye was only using Chu Feng as an excuse to deal with him.<br>&ldquo;Elder, did you hear that? This is what Shengguang Xuanye has been doing all along. Do you understand what kind of situation our Holy Light Galaxy has been in all along?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to Shengguang Buyu and asked.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you need not worry. Our Holy Valley will be taking over the Holy Light Galaxy from now on. Our Holy Monarch will not let you down,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu promised.<br>Following that, the Holy Valley announced two things to the crowd.<br>First and foremost, the Holy Valley would be taking over the Holy Light Clan and the Holy Light Galaxy. This announcement didn&rsquo;t come as a surprise to the crowd.<br>What was truly surprising was the second news.<br>Secondly, Chu Feng and the Holy Valley were on close ties. Anyone who offended Chu Feng would have offended the Holy Valley too.<br>Even members of the Holy Valley would have to treat Chu Feng with utmost respect.<br>This announcement solidified Chu Feng&rsquo;s standing in the Holy Light Galaxy, putting him above even most from the Holy Valley. Even the Holy Light Clan, despite being the previous overlord of the Holy Light Galaxy, was now likely to be beneath Chu Feng.<br>After making those two announcements, the Holy Valley proceeded to reward the Monstrous Herd Temple and the Dragon Clan. They were being rewarded for their courage in standing together with Chu Feng during times of danger.<br>The Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster was delighted to hear that. It was just a moment ago that he was going to lose his life, but all of a sudden, he was being rewarded instead. Such swiftly changing circumstances left him feeling a little pensive.<br>As for the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, he was overjoyed to have staked his bet on Chu Feng. He had seen with his own eyes how Shengguang Baimei had apologized to Chu Feng back in the Holy Valley.<br>He realized that the Dragon Clan had just found its greatest backing ever. The Dragon Clan was going to rise to prominence thanks to Chu Feng!<br>The other powers felt regretful upon seeing the treatment the Monstrous Herd Temple and the Dragon Clan had received. Had they known that things would turn out like this, they would have surely forged closer ties with Chu Feng back then.<br>Even if they dared not to appear too friendly with him on the surface, they could at least express some goodwill toward him behind the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s back. They had known all this while that Chu Feng would rise to greatness given the talent he had displayed.<br>The fact that the Holy Valley had changed its attitude toward Chu Feng showed that there was either someone strong behind his back or that he had proven himself worthy of the Holy Valley&rsquo;s respect.<br>In any case, it wouldn&rsquo;t be long before Chu Feng became a powerhouse in the Holy Light Galaxy. Given his talents and the Holy Valley&rsquo;s backing, it was only a matter of time before his name spread far and wide in this massive world of cultivation!<br>Meanwhile, most of the juniors who were acquainted with Chu Feng felt a little conflicted, especially Fu Feiyue from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect. He had a conflict with Chu Feng previously, and while it was eventually resolved, he still wasn&rsquo;t too fond of the latter.<br>He had been working hard on his cultivation in hopes that he could surpass Chu Feng one day, but all of a sudden, he found that Chu Feng had reached a height far beyond what he might reach in his lifetime. Even the experts from the Holy Valley were treating him with respect.<br>In contrast, he was still no more than an insignificant individual in this huge world of cultivation, unworthy of anyone&rsquo;s attention.<br>Such a huge difference left him feeling deeply despaired. He could no longer imagine himself catching up with Chu Feng anymore.<br>As reluctant as he felt, there was nothing he could do here.<br>As for Chu Feng, he stood high up in the sky, enjoying the respect and admiration coming from the crowd. There was no way he wasn&rsquo;t delighted by how things had turned out.<br>It was just that he felt a little regretful that there was no one from the Chu Heavenly Clan who could enjoy this honor with him.<br>Even to this day, he still didn&rsquo;t know where the members of the Chu Heavenly Clan were.<br>Wu!<br>All of a sudden, Chu Feng&rsquo;s face paled. He found himself unable to stand upright anymore.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Buyu quickly rushed forward to support Chu Feng. Everyone else also directed concerned looks toward him. Shengguang Baimei even rushed to his side as soon as possible.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could feel himself falling into a feeble state. A wave of frailty was enveloping his body, causing him to swiftly lose his strength. He was unable to fight against this sensation, and it didn&rsquo;t take long for him to lose consciousness.<br>When he finally woke up once more, he found himself lying in one of the palaces of the Holy Light Clan. There were only two people beside him, and they were Long Xiaoxiao and Daoist Niantian.<br>&ldquo;How are you feeling, Chu Feng?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked anxiously.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>He was feeling fine now. His condition seemed to have reverted back to normal.<br>&ldquo;Elder, it seems like my soul was impaired? Were you the one who treated me?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to Daoist Niantian and asked.<br>He could clearly sense his soul swiftly weakening before he lost consciousness, but his soul was completely fixed now. He couldn&rsquo;t trace the root of the problem anymore.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao isn&rsquo;t an outsider, so I&rsquo;ll get straight to the point. Chu Feng, you shouldn&rsquo;t use the means you have used against Shengguang Xuanye anymore. At least not in Martial Exalted level. It has dealt irreparable damage to you. I have helped you stabilize your condition for the time being, but there could be several side effects.<br>&ldquo;If you continue using it, your condition will worsen. It might cap your future cultivation,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, is it that serious?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt a clench in his heart.<br>He knew that the Daoist Niantian was referring to the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes.<br>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s that serious. However, that&rsquo;s only to be expected. Such a powerful attack has broken the common sense in our world of cultivation. It&rsquo;s only natural that you&rsquo;d have to pay a heavy price for that. The backlash is not something your current body can withstand,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, will I be able to withstand the backlash if I were to reach Half God level in the future?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>The Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes was his trump card. He couldn&rsquo;t possibly just chuck it aside and never use it again.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you know that skill of yours better than I do. It&rsquo;s my deduction that the irreparable damage inflicted on your soul was caused by that skill, but you have to decide for yourself whether your body can afford to continue using it or not.<br>&ldquo;There are only two ways here. Either your body grows strong enough to withstand the backlash, or you fully master it such that it won&rsquo;t be able to hurt you anymore. Otherwise, you shouldn&rsquo;t even think about using it,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s not use that skill anymore.&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao looked at Chu Feng with reddened eyes. She was traumatized when she first heard of this news. She was afraid that something might have happened to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Chu Feng told her with a smile. He turned his attention back to Daoist Niantian and clasped his fist, saying, &ldquo;Thank you for your advice, elder. I&rsquo;ll take heed of it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You really should. This isn&rsquo;t anything minor. Speaking of which, you haven&rsquo;t heard of it yet, right?&rdquo; Daoist Niantian asked.<br>His gaze changed a little when he asked that question.<br>&ldquo;What are you referring to, elder?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He sensed that Daoist Niantian was speaking about something very important here.<br>&ldquo;I guess you still don&rsquo;t know why Shengguang Xuanye dared to make a move on you all of a sudden,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>&ldquo;Is it not because he has the backing of the Holy Valley?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s because of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Princess Miaomiao,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian replied.<br>&ldquo;Miaomiao? What&rsquo;s wrong with her?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng shot to his feet. His gut feeling told him that something must have happened.<br>&ldquo;She&hellip; is dead,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br></p></div>
