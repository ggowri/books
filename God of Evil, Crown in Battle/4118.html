        <h1>Chapter 4117</h1>
        <div> - Fear<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was restricting Chu Feng was oppressive might.<br>That oppressive might was far superior to the oppressive might of an Utmost Exalted&rsquo;s oppressive might. It was a martial power even more powerful than the martial power of an Utmost Exalted.<br>If Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess was correct, that should be a Martial Exalted&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>Even amongst Utmost Exalted, there were countless individuals capable of easily killing Chu Feng.<br>If a Martial Exalted wanted to kill them, a single thought would be sufficient.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng felt that they were done for.<br>Right at that moment, a furious shout sounded, &ldquo;Release me! Do you know who I am?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you dare touch us, I will have your entire Netherworld Ice Hall be buried with us!&rdquo;<br>It was actually Fumo Shaoyu.<br>As Chu Feng looked to Fumo Shaoyu, he discovered that he had a look of panic on his face.<br>From how his body shivered, Chu Feng could tell that he was extremely scared.<br>It was precisely because Chu Feng could tell that he was scared that Chu Feng was surprised that he could say such unyielding words at that moment.<br>Was this not courting death?<br>&ldquo;Audacious zealot, I&rsquo;ve already spared your life once. Yet, you actually do not know how to repent?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you insist on dying, I will help you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Die!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the fierce and vicious voice sounded again.<br>At the same time as the voice sounded, Chu Feng felt an enormous change to his surroundings.<br>It was killing intent.<br>The killing intent was not particularly strong. However, when the killing intent was added to the enormously powerful oppressive might, it created an extremely terrifying power.<br>Even though there was clearly no change to their surroundings, Chu Feng felt as if he had fallen into hell.<br>At the same time as the voice shouted, Chu Feng felt that his life was going to come to an end.<br>The four of them would all die there.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a ray of light appeared from the sky and enveloped Chu Feng and the others.<br>The light not only blocked that oppressive might, but it also dispersed the killing intent.<br>Following that light, a figure and a spirit formation gate appeared.<br>That figure was none other than Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandmother, the old granny.<br>The old granny&rsquo;s body was emitting the same sort of light as the light that had separated everything and enveloped Chu Feng and others.<br>Chu Feng knew that it was that old granny that had saved them.<br>&ldquo;Grandma, you&rsquo;ve come in the end. I knew that you wouldn&rsquo;t let us die.&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er rushed over to her grandma in joy and tightly hugged her.<br>&ldquo;Stop acting like a spoiled bitch and leave immediately.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All of you scram back to the sealed territory. Without my permission, you are not allowed to come out,&rdquo; the old granny said as she pointed to the spirit formation gate.<br>Hearing that, Fumo Shaoyu did not hesitate. He grabbed Little Fishy with one hand and Chu Feng with his other hand. Then, he went into the spirit formation gate.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er ran into the spirit formation gate right after him.<br>Upon entering the spirit formation gate, the four of them arrived at a spirit formation tunnel.<br>After passing through the tunnel, they found that they&rsquo;d appeared far away from the Netherworld Ice Hall. They were unable to even catch sight of the Netherworld Ice Hall at that moment. They were in a very safe location.<br>&ldquo;What a powerful spirit formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked up to the still squirming spirit formation gate and gasped in admiration.<br>Then, he looked at Fumo Xin&rsquo;er and asked, &ldquo;Exactly what is your grandma&rsquo;s world spirit techniques&rsquo; level?&rdquo;<br>As the old granny&rsquo;s spirit formation had been very concealed, Chu Feng was unable to determine what her level of world spirit techniques were at.<br>The only thing he was certain of was that the old granny&rsquo;s world spirit techniques far surpassed his own.<br>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know the specifics either. We actually do not know how powerful our grandma is,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the spirit formation gate started to tremble violently. The spirit formation gate that they'd come from actually closed shut.<br>However, the old granny had not come out of it.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that some sort of accident had happened?&rdquo; Chu Feng was very worried.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s improbable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s my grandma, she should be able to safely escape. Perhaps she was thinking for our sake by severing that spirit formation gate,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t overthink things. Let&rsquo;s leave this troublesome area,&rdquo; added Fumo Shaoyu.<br>Seeing that the siblings were extremely confident in their grandma, Chu Feng stopped asking about.<br>After all, in terms of understanding, the two of them most definitely knew their grandma far better than he did.<br>With that, the four of them set off towards the sealed territory.<br>After all, judging from the situation at that moment, the safest place in the entire Heaven-devouring Realm would be the sealed territory.<br>&hellip;...<br>Netherworld Ice Hall. Outside the main hall.<br>Silhouettes densely packed the sky and ground. They were all standing orderly.<br>It was an army of tens of thousands. They&rsquo;d surrounded the main hall with multiple layers.<br>Those were all troops from the Netherworld Ice Hall.<br>The person leading the army was an old man clad in frost-ice armor.<br>That person had a fierce look on his face. Just by looking at him, one would be intimidated and would not dare to trifle with him.<br>The oppressive might that he emitted shook both heaven and earth.<br>He was the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, a Martial Exalted-level expert.<br>It was due to him that the Netherworld Ice Hall had gained their current status.<br>He was equivalent to a god in the Netherworld Ice Hall. Everything was under his rule.<br>Generally, the old man would have an expressionless face. After all, everything was under the grasp of his palm. Very rarely were there things that could surprise him.<br>However, at that moment, the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master actually had a slight frown on his face.<br>His aged yet vicious eyes were staring at the direction of the main hall.<br>The main hall had originally been sealed by him using his oppressive might.<br>At that moment, his oppressive might had been withdrawn. Yet, there was a body of light that covered the sky and the ground, sealing off the main hall.<br>That body of light was extremely dazzling. Because of that, the entire Netherworld Ice Hall had become particularly bright.<br>However, most important of all would be how that body of light was able to block the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>Actually, when the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had been provoked by Fumo Shaoyu, he had planned to kill all of them.<br>It was precisely that body of light that had blocked his attack.<br>That was the reason why the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was frowning.<br>It meant that there was actually someone in the Heaven-devouring Realm capable of contending against him.<br>There was someone that could shake his position.<br>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master asked with a stern voice.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after his words left his mouth, that body of light suddenly shone particularly brightly.<br>Then, the body of light began to spread.<br>The light was so dazzlingly bright that the people from the Netherworld Ice Hall found themselves unable to open their eyes.<br>Furthermore, as the light spread it also brought along an enormous force with it. With the main hall as the center, it spread all around the Netherworld Ice Hall.<br>The impact was simply too strong. Even the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was forced to retreat tens of thousands of meters by the force before finally stabilizing himself.<br>When the impact dissipated, the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall master looked up again. Upon doing so, his expression changed enormously.<br>He was no longer simply frowning. Instead, his face showed an expression of deep fear.<br></p></div>
