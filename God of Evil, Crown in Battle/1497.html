        <h1>Chapter 1497</h1>
        <div> - A Single Chess Piece<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;I actually forgot this matter.&rdquo;<br>Only when Dugu Xingfeng left did Chu Feng remember that he had yet to mention to Dugu Xingfeng that he had already requested Hong Qiang&rsquo;s help, and was also planning to request the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong&rsquo;s help as well.<br>As Dugu Xingfeng had left quite quickly, Chu Feng had not managed to mention this matter to him. However, upon recalling the attitude Dugu Xingfeng had displayed toward him earlier, Chu Feng assumed that Dugu Xingfeng would likely not mind even if he were to request help from others.<br>However, Chu Feng still planned to inform Dugu Xingfeng. After all, it was better to inform someone about something like this.<br>If they were to meet later and Dugu Xingfeng became displeased, it would become awkward.<br>However, before doing that, Chu Feng decided to find the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong to tell them about this first.<br>As Hong Qiang said, the Cursed Soil Sect was no ordinary place. If one wished to proceed to that place to save someone, one must possess absolute certainty in being able to do so.<br>Every additional peak Half Martial Emperor-level expert would be an additional safeguard.<br>Chu Feng arrived at the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s residence. Soon, he managed to see the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong.<br>Chu Feng mentioned the matter of requesting their help in saving Tantai Xue to them. Like Dugu Xingfeng, the two of them did not ask much and straightforwardly agreed to help Chu Feng.<br>Furthermore, the two of them said the same thing as Dugu Xingfeng. They said that this matter was extremely important and must be conducted in the dark, and told Chu Feng to gather with them in secret.<br>Thus, Chu Feng decided to set up a meeting with them at the same place that he was going to meet up with Dugu Xingfeng.<br>This time around, Chu Feng did not make the same mistake he did last time. He directly mentioned to the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong that he had already invited Hong Qiang and Dugu Xingfeng to help him.<br>Toward this, the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong did not have any disapproval. Instead, the two of them felt that Chu Feng&rsquo;s decision was very wise and that everything had gone quite smoothly.<br>After this, Chu Feng proceeded to Dugu Xingfeng&rsquo;s residence. He had to inform Dugu Xingfeng about this matter.<br>Dugu Xingfeng&rsquo;s residence could be said to be one of the most tightly guarded places in the Cyanwood Mountain. Not to mention disciples, even ordinary elders were not allowed to enter.<br>However, after Chu Feng arrived at this place, no one dared to stop him. It was clear that the elders guarding this place had received special orders to not stop Chu Feng should he come by.<br>Thus, Chu Feng managed to meet up with Dugu Xingfeng again, and informed him about the thing that he had forgotten to tell him earlier.<br>After Dugu Xingfeng heard what Chu Feng said, he started to smile. It was a smile of joy. That was because, like Miao Renlong and the others, he also felt this to be a sensible act and a good thing on top of that. Furthermore, he mentioned to Chu Feng to have Hong Qiang, Miao Renlong and the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master gather with him at the place he told Chu Feng earlier.<br>Sure enough, great minds think alike.<br>After seeing that Dugu Xingfeng had also agreed to it, Chu Feng felt completely relieved. Furthermore, he had also become much more confident in being able to save Tantai Xue. After all, the battle formation that they were going with was extremely grand.<br>However, there was something worthy of being mentioned. When Chu Feng left Dugu Xingfeng&rsquo;s palace, he encountered a person, a person who he disliked greatly and who also disliked him greatly. It was Crazed Killer Tuoba.<br>When Chu Feng saw Crazed Killer Tuoba, he decided to ignore him. As if he had never seen him, Chu Feng walked by him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, as a disciple, do you not understand the rule that states that you must greet elders courteously on the spot when you meet them?&rdquo; Crazed Killer Tuoba spoke and stopped Chu Feng. His tone was filled with disapproval.<br>&ldquo;Lord Headmaster has told me that I do not have to display a courteous greeting even when I see him. Yet you actually want me to greet you courteously? Could it be that you think that your status is more respectable than Lord Headmaster&rsquo;s?&rdquo; Chu Feng snorted coldly. He did not even bother to look Crazed Killer Tuoba in the eyes.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t you try to rely on the fact that Lord Headmaster thinks highly of you to act with no regard for laws and rules. Don&rsquo;t forget, you are still only a mere disciple,&rdquo; Crazed Killer Tuoba said with fierceness.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I, Chu Feng, am only a mere disciple. As for you, you are the grand head of the Punishment Department. However&hellip; I, Chu Feng, am precisely not afraid of you. In fact, I disapprove of you. What can you possibly do about it?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Crazed Killer Tuoba started to gnash his teeth in anger. However, he soon released his tightly clenched fists. He was trying his hardest to control his killing intent.<br>&ldquo;Lord Headmaster fancies precisely me. If you disapprove of that, why don&rsquo;t you go and have Lord Headmaster fancy you the way he fancies me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you do not have that ability, then get the hell to the side. This world is a place where only the ones with ability can stand up tall. I, Chu Feng, am currently the favorite person of Lord Headmaster. Compared to me, you are nothing at all.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng knew that not only was Crazed Killer Tuoba very detesting of him, he was also now very jealous of him. Thus, Chu Feng deliberately said those words to provoke Crazed Killer Tuoba.<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng disregarded Crazed Killer Tuoba and began to proceed toward his own residence.<br>&ldquo;You damned bastard who doesn&rsquo;t know what seniority is!&rdquo; As he saw Chu Feng&rsquo;s leaving back view, Crazed Killer Tuoba was so angered that his complexion turned ashen. Even after Chu Feng left, he was still standing there and looking at the direction that Chu Feng had left in with enraged eyes.<br>&ldquo;No matter what, you are still the head of the Punishment Department. Why anger yourself because of a disciple? Wouldn&rsquo;t this make you appear to be deeply lacking in presence?&rdquo; Suddenly, a voice sounded from the palace hall. It was Dugu Xingfeng.<br>After hearing those words, Crazed Killer Tuoba immediately turned his gaze around and rapidly entered the palace hall.<br>At this moment, Dugu Xingfeng was standing in the center of the palace hall. He had his hands behind his back and had his back facing Crazed Killer Tuoba. He was giving off the imposing airs of a very capable person.<br>&ldquo;Lord Headmaster, it is not this subordinate that is lacking presence. Merely, that Chu Feng is truly too arrogant. No matter what, he is only a disciple. How could he speak to me in such a manner?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I also know that he is a rarely seen genius. However, if this is to continue, I truly fear that you will spoil him,&rdquo; Crazed Killer Tuoba said.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip; oh Crazed Killer, I know you thought highly of Qin Lingyun. Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing of Qin Lingyun has caused a lot of complaint in your heart. However, as the head of the Punishment Department, as my future successor, if you do not even have this amount of tolerance, you will truly disappoint me,&rdquo; Dugu Xingfeng turned around. The gaze with which he looked to Crazed Killer Tuoba was extremely gentle.<br>&ldquo;Lord Headmaster, didn&rsquo;t you have White Ape&hellip; could it be?&rdquo; When Crazed Killer Tuoba heard the word &lsquo;successor,&rsquo; his gaze instantly changed to one of endless anticipation.<br>&ldquo;White Ape can&rsquo;t do. He is too soft and compassionate. I have already consulted with Lord Assembly Master, as well as all of the other Lords in the Sacred Assembly. In a short while, I will be abdicating my position as headmaster and entering the Cyanwood Sacred Assembly to wholeheartedly train. As for the position of headmaster, you will be the one to take over for me,&rdquo; Dugu Xingfeng said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you Lord Headmaster for your affection,&rdquo; Suddenly, Crazed Killer Tuoba knelt onto the ground with a grateful expression all over his face.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for you to be this courteous with me. Remember, no matter how talented Chu Feng is, he is only a disciple. As for you, you are the person who I regard as the most valuable. In my heart, he is greatly inferior to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While my current actions might appear to be pampering Chu Feng, it is actually merely to exploit him. In my eye, he is merely a chess piece, a chess piece to take care of the World Spiritist Alliance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for you, Crazed Killer Tuoba, you are my, Dugu Xingfeng&rsquo;s, trusted aide.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to get angered by him, wouldn&rsquo;t this only be asking for trouble upon yourself?&rdquo; Dugu Xingfeng said as he patted Crazed Killer Tuoba&rsquo;s shoulder.<br>&ldquo;This subordinate is truly slow-witted to not know about Lord Headmaster&rsquo;s intentions. This subordinate deserves to be punished.&rdquo; Crazed Killer Tuoba started to kowtow nonstop. He was feeling grateful from the bottom of his heart.<br>&ldquo;Come, rise. It&rsquo;s not too late to realize it now. Not long from now, the Cyanwood Mountain will be yours. With how highly I think of you, you must make sure to not disappoint me,&rdquo; Dugu Xingfeng said with a beaming smile. Concealed within his eyes was an indeterminable scheme.<br></p></div>
