        <div>: Predator Spotting Its Prey<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Y-you! Nonsense! If you dare spout such nonsense again, I&rsquo;ll rip off your mouth!&rdquo; Shengguang Haoxuan bellowed angrily, but he was unable to conceal his awkwardness.<br>&ldquo;My bad, I take my words back. I didn&rsquo;t know that you were trying to conceal it,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a mocking smile.<br>He turned to the other men present and said, &ldquo;Humans are naturally attracted to beauty. What&rsquo;s wrong with taking a look? There&rsquo;s no reason to be so dodgy about it. What do the rest of you think?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Those men either turned away or lowered their heads; none of them dared to face Chu Feng directly. They were feeling embarrassed.<br>They had also been staring at Shengguang Menglai and Shengguang Xintian earlier.<br>&ldquo;Enough, what&rsquo;s wrong with taking a look? I also like looking too. It&rsquo;s only normal to admire beauty,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu spoke up jokingly.<br>The crowd knew that Shengguang Buyu was just alleviating the awkward atmosphere, so they laughed in response to his remark.<br>&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll emphasize one last time. You&rsquo;ll be comrades for this trip, and I expect to see all of you return safe and sound. I know that young friend Chu Feng isn&rsquo;t a member of our<br>Valley, but he&rsquo;s still our guest. Make sure to get along with him well.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing for you to argue with one another, but you aren&rsquo;t allowed to come to blows. Do you hear me?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Buyu specifically turned to Shengguang Haoxuan as he said those words.<br>&ldquo;I understand, Lord Buyu.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Buyu had a fairly high standing in the<br>Valley, such that even the cold Shengguang Menglai also responded to his words.<br>It was just that even though Shengguang Haoxuan still felt a little dissatisfied on the inside. As a member of the great<br>Valley, he felt that the cultivators out there were no different from slaves. The likes of Chu Feng weren&rsquo;t even worthy of carrying his shoes.<br>Yet, such a slave actually dared to ogle at the beauties of the<br>Valley so openly. How could he possibly stand that?<br>However, he also knew that they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to enter the<br>Lotus Tree if not for Chu Feng, and Shengguang Buyu obviously didn&rsquo;t want any conflict between them. Thus, he had no choice but to suppress his anger.<br>&ldquo;Haoxuan, if you manage to enter the<br>Lotus Tree safely, I want you to find a chance to eliminate Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>A voice transmission suddenly sounded in Shengguang Haoxuan&rsquo;s ears then.<br>Shengguang Haoxuan immediately turned to look at Shengguang Baimei, and upon seeing the look on the latter&rsquo;s face, he felt a surge of joy in his heart.<br>The person who had said those words to him was no other than Shengguang Baimei, and Shengguang Baimei was one of the two strongest individuals in the<br>Valley beneath the Holy Monarch.<br>In the circumstances that the<br>was absent, his words carried the most weight, meaning that it wouldn&rsquo;t be an exaggeration to say that Shengguang Baimei&rsquo;s order was like an edict.<br>&ldquo;You must be Chu Feng. I apologize for my earlier offense. Make sure to follow us obediently once we&rsquo;re inside the cultivation realm and don&rsquo;t wander off. Otherwise, we won&rsquo;t be able to guarantee your safety,&rdquo; Shengguang Haoxuan said.<br>&ldquo;Young master Haoxuan, the<br>Lotus Tree is nothing more than a cultivation realm. There&rsquo;s no danger in there. As long as you get along well, nothing ought to happen to young friend Chu Feng,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu suddenly spoke up then.<br>It was a disguised warning toward Shengguang Haoxuan, telling him not to carelessly lay a finger on Chu Feng. He knew deep well that there was no danger inside the<br>Lotus Tree at all.<br>&ldquo;Oh? Are you threatening me now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Threatening you? Do you think that you&rsquo;re worthy of my threat? I&rsquo;m just giving you a reminder, countryside bumpkin,&rdquo; Shengguang Haoxuan sneered.<br>&ldquo;I should offer you a warning too. Trouble usually starts from the mouth. Show some courtesy when you speak to me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? A countryside bumpkin like you actually dares to threaten me? You&rsquo;re asking for a beating!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Haoxuan looked incredibly displeased. It seemed like he would really beat up Chu Feng on the spot if the latter dared to make any other insolent remarks here.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to cultivate anymore? If so, you can back down right now. There are many others waiting to take your place!&rdquo; a cold voice sounded.<br>It was from Shengguang Menglai. Her voice had an icy edge to it, but it was surprisingly pleasant. As soon as she intervened, not even Shengguang Haoxuan dared to harp on this matter anymore.<br>It could be seen that Shengguang Haoxuan was more fearful of Shengguang Menglai as compared to Shengguang Buyu.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, Lord Buyu. Is there anything else you would like to inform us of? Otherwise, we&rsquo;ll be heading in.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Menglai respectfully bowed to Shengguang Baimei and Shengguang Buyu, and her tone was much more courteous than before too.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else. You may go ahead,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei and Shengguang Buyu replied.<br>Chu Feng and the others began approaching the<br>Lotus Tree.<br>Shengguang Buyu couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a little nervous. If the barrier were to dissipate upon Chu Feng&rsquo;s approach, it would mean that the<br>Lotus Tree&rsquo;s full bloom was indeed caused by Chu Feng&rsquo;s presence, and that would ensure his safety.<br>If not, Chu Feng would be immediately taken away by Shengguang Baimei and put through the worst tortures the<br>Valley had to offer.<br>Shengguang Baimei would spare no effort in forcing Chu Feng to divulge the martial skill he had used to deal with Shengguang Xuanye. If so, Chu Feng&rsquo;s fate would be miserable!<br>Weng!<br>His worries turned out to be unfounded.<br>As soon as Chu Feng came close, not only did the barrier around the<br>Lotus Tree vanish, a ray of light even descended from the heart of the<br>Lotus Tree to enshroud the group.<br>&ldquo;What a unique sight. Is this the effects of the full bloom?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xintian, Shengguang Haoxuan, and the others were mesmerized by the light shining on them. This was their first time entering the<br>Lotus Tree, but they had long heard many things about it.<br>The predecessors who had entered the<br>Lotus Tree prior to them weren&rsquo;t entitled to such a warm welcome.<br>Weng!<br>All of a sudden, the light shining from the<br>Lotus Tree started to contract, turning into a special spotlight focusing solely on Chu Feng. This naturally made Chu Feng the center of everyone&rsquo;s attention.<br>&ldquo;Sssss!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei frowned at the sight, and he clenched his fists tightly as well.<br>Meanwhile, Shengguang Buyu was delighted to see that.<br>His claim that the<br>Lotus Tree had blossomed due to Chu Feng was just a guess previously, but this sight proved his claim. The full bloom had indeed occurred due to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It looks like this cultivation realm is much more polite as compared to someone else. At least it knows how to welcome a guest.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng opened his arms wide and enjoyed the light shining on him. He specially shot a glance at Shengguang Haoxuan.<br>&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Haoxuan let out a cold harrumph as he marched ahead toward the<br>Lotus Tree. He didn&rsquo;t speak a word, but everyone could tell that he was infuriated.<br>Nevertheless, he tried his best to hold back his anger. He knew that Chu Feng would never walk out of the cultivation realm alive as long as he was here. He would have plenty of chances to kill the latter inside.<br>The rest of the crowd also walked past Chu Feng to head toward the<br>Lotus Tree. Due to that, no one noticed Chu Feng reining in his smile. There was a terrifying glint in his eyes.<br>It was the look of a predator spotting its prey.<br></p></div>
