        <h1>Chapter 899</h1>
        <div> - The Invasion of an Army<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Such an abrupt situation shocked everyone.<br>However, when they looked towards the exit, they were shocked even more, because the ones who broke down the door weren&rsquo;t any stranger, but Chun Wu and Xia Yu.<br>At that moment, their faces were full of panic. One could even say Chu Feng had never seen them with such panicked expressions before. After seeing Qiushui Fuyan, they acted as if they saw their savior. They said, together, &ldquo;Senior Qiushui, this is bad!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What happened? Did something go wrong with Lady Piaomiao when she was concocting the pellet?&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan asked upon seeing their anxious expressions.<br>&ldquo;No. She&rsquo;s fine, but the situation right now seems to be even worse,&rdquo; Xia Yu said.<br>&ldquo;What exactly happened? Tell me in detail,&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan quickly asked.<br>&ldquo;Senior Qiushui, I can&rsquo;t explain this in short. It&rsquo;s best that you follow us.&rdquo; Chun Wu immediately turned around and ran down the peak. Seeing that, Qiushui Fuyan quickly followed, and as for Chu Feng and the others, they too followed.<br>With Chun Wu leading the way, all of them arrived at the centermost peak of the Misty Peak. On it, there was an enormous palace. Outside that palace, Chu Feng saw Qiu Zhu, Dong Xue, and even Yan Ruyu.<br>However, they were not the only ones there. On that peak, everyone with high positions was there. All the experts on the Misty Peak had gathered there. They stood orderly, with a battle-ready appearance.<br>At that moment, Qiushui Fuyan had realized how serious this was. She did not stop, and instead, stepped directly into the palace. As for Chu Feng and the others, they also stepped in.<br>After they entered the palace, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes lit up because there was a very profound formation there. To be more precise, it was a very special Formation Aperture.<br>On the outside of that Formation Aperture, there were thirty-eight elders sitting cross-legged. They all had snow-white hair, and faces full of wrinkles. Judging by their appearances, one knew they had at least lived for over a hundred years. Their cultivations were not that weak either&mdash;they were all peak Martial Lords. With just a step forward in cultivation, they would be able to become Martial Kings.<br>Chu Feng had never seen those elders before, and as such it could be seen that they had always been guarding this Formation Aperture and didn&rsquo;t take even half a step away from this place.<br>When looking towards the aperture, Chu Feng discovered it was truly quite mystical. Within it, Chu Feng could see the strength of the formation. After detailed observation, Chu Feng could even see a picture inside&mdash;a map.<br>Typical people would simply be confused by the content of that map, but Chu Feng understood. He could see several symbols within the map.<br>The Misty Peak, Teleportation Array&hellip; Nearly everything within the borders of the Misty Peak was clearly indicated on the map. Even the sea beasts swimming at the bottom of the sea and the birds flying through the air were clearly shown in the Formation Aperture.<br>It not only indicated all living beings within the borders of the Misty Peak, even the living beings outside were indicated. Moreover, based off of their strength, they differed in colour.<br>At that very instant, innumerable living beings appeared in every single direction around the Misty Peak. They were like an army of ants as they flew towards the Misty Peak with extremely quick speed.<br>Moreover, due to the dark-red colours, Chu Feng knew there were also many Martial Kings within the army flocking forth from every single direction.<br>&ldquo;Activate the formation!&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan explosively shouted.<br>*whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh* After her words, the thirty-eight elders all opened their eyes in unison, their hands quickly changing as they endlessly cast unique spells, which finally formed a seal. After a light shout, the Formation Aperture started to change.<br>*boom rumble rumble*<br>Chu Feng and the others felt a faint tremble beneath their feet. Casting their gazes to the outside, they discovered several enormous Spirit Formations surging in the sky. It sealed the entire Misty Peak&mdash;it was a defensive formation.<br>&ldquo;Senior Qiushui, what do we do? It seems that there&rsquo;s an army coming to invade the Misty Peak.&rdquo; Chun Wu and the others heaved a sigh of relief after seeing the activation of the defensive formation. However, the fear on their faces did not diminish.<br>&ldquo;We are not certain whether they are enemy or ally. I will first go notify your master.&rdquo; As Qiushui Fuyan spoke, she prepared to head off.<br>&ldquo;Northwest direction, there is army invading our borders.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Northeast direction, there is army invading our borders.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Southwest direction, there is army invading our borders.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Southeast direction, there is army invading our borders.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...&rdquo;<br>However, before Qiushui Fuyan left the palace, the thirty-eight elders surrounding the Formation Aperture all started speaking.<br>When she turned her head around to look, Qiushui Fuyan&rsquo;s expression changed greatly because only then from the map, a dense body of people entering the borders of the Misty Peak from every single direction. They were nearing the Misty Peak.<br>*whoosh* When she saw that, Qiushui Fuyan didn&rsquo;t hesitate. She leapt out and disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Stay here, don&rsquo;t go anywhere.&rdquo; After Chu Feng left those words behind for Zi Ling and the others, he left the palace and went straight for the peak&rsquo;s entrance.<br>However, Zi Ling and the others who realized that there was something wrong didn&rsquo;t listen to Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. They also followed Chu Feng and ran towards the entrance.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, this&hellip;&rdquo; After they arrived at the entrance to the Misty Peak, Zhang Tianyi, Jiang Wushang, and everyone else were instantly stupefied.<br>At that very instant, several miles away, the dense body of people had surrounded the entire Misty Peak.<br>They were many people there&mdash;at least several tens of millions. Most importantly, of that army of people, the weakest were at the peak of the Heaven realm, while the rest were all Martial Lords.<br>There were simply innumerable peak Martial Lords, and there were even several Martial Kings.<br>The group with the largest number of people all wore the same clothing. Everyone recognized who they were&mdash;they were from the Immortal Execution Archipelago.<br>Other than the Immortal Execution Archipelago&rsquo;s army, there were also many people from other forces. Clearly, they were the ones who had allied with them.<br>Other than humans, there were even many other Monstrous Beasts. Of those, the ones that caught the eye the most were the huge birds swirling around in the sky, bodies ablaze. They were the Inferno Divine Bird clan, one of the Three Great Monstrous Clans.<br>Other than them, there were also monsters with bodies akin to rock. One could not see their facial features, and could only see their blood-red eyes. The smallest was still over a dozen meters tall, and the tallest were dozens of meters tall. When they stood in the air, they were like a mountain peak that had been plucked into the sky. They seemed indestructible as they deterred the world.<br>Without even thinking, one could tell they were another powerful Monstrous Beast clan of the Three Great Monstrous Clans, the Boulder Mutation Beast clan.<br>&ldquo;Look, there are also things in the water!&rdquo; Suddenly, Su Mei shouted as she pointed at the surging waves.<br>Looking over, there were indeed peculiar bodies swimming within the surging waves. Those things seemed like fishes, yet also like beasts. Their blood-red scales throughout their bodies did make them seem ugly; however, their aura was extremely powerful.<br>Even the Monstrous Beasts that lived in this sea, after seeing them, let out cries and quickly evaded. From that, one could tell how terrifying these blood-coloured odd fishes were.<br>They were naturally no ordinary sea beasts. They were one of the Three Great Monstrous Clans of the Eastern Sea Region, the Blood-Scale Monstrous Fish clan.<br>Today, not only did the Immortal Execution Archipelago arrive, even the Three Great Monstrous Clans had come.<br></p></div>
