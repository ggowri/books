        <div> - Revealing One&rsquo;s Ability<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Lord Valley master, please calm your anger. This subordinate truly didn&rsquo;t know that this Chu Feng was actually an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,&rdquo; Li Rui&rsquo;s master hurriedly tried to explain.<br>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley revealed a suspicious expression.<br>&ldquo;Lord Valley Master, this subordinate would not dare to deceive you. I truly didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Li Rui&rsquo;s master continued to explain.<br>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know? Head Law Enforcement Elder, you really didn&rsquo;t know that I was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you really didn&rsquo;t know that I was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, why did you force-feed me that medicinal pellet that restricted my spirit power and my ability to speak?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that it wasn&rsquo;t because you were afraid that Lord Valley Master would find out that I&rsquo;m an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Li Rui&rsquo;s master. His tone was very sharp, stabbing straight at the crucial things.<br>&ldquo;What? You actually fed him a medicinal pellet that sealed his spirit power and even his speech?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master was extremely shocked.<br>&ldquo;Lord Valley Master, please do not listen to his nonsense. I simply did not feed him such a medicinal pellet,&rdquo; Li Rui&rsquo;s master hurriedly explained.<br>&ldquo;You shut up first!&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master berated coldly. Li Rui&rsquo;s master no longer dared to quibble. Like that, he quietly kneeled on the ground.<br>In response, the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master looked to Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;You are called Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, if you have received unjust treatment, I will definitely obtain justice for you later. However, I have a presumptuous request right now,&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master said.<br>&ldquo;Do you want me to treat your Lady Mother&rsquo;s illness?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Are you willing?&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master asked.<br>&ldquo;Lord Valley Master, please lead the way,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Please follow me,&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng agreed to help, the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master revealed a relaxed smile.<br>However, before showing the way for Chu Feng, he used his sharp gaze to look at Li Rui&rsquo;s master, &ldquo;Elder Tuoba, wait here. Before I return, you are not allowed to leave.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, Milord,&rdquo; Li Rui&rsquo;s master replied respectfully.<br>At that moment, he no longer possessed the same sort of complacence he had earlier. Instead, nervousness and unease filled his face.<br>Being led by the Valley Master, Chu Feng walked deep into the Valley Master&rsquo;s residence. He then arrived at a neat and tidy bedchamber.<br>This bedchamber was not very large, and was decorated very simply. Although it was not majestic, it was very neat. When looking at it, one would feel very comfortable.<br>Right after entering the bedchamber, Chu Feng heard the painful voice of an elderly person.<br>It was a female. She was extremely old, so old that her body was filled with wrinkles and age spots. Even her hair was nearly all gone, as were all of her teeth.<br>As for this woman, she was being tormented by the pain of her illness so much so that she had lost consciousness.<br>Needing no introduction, Chu Feng managed to guess that this old woman must be the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master&rsquo;s mother.<br>Merely, to Chu Feng&rsquo;s surprise, the mother of the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master did not possess a high level of cultivation. In fact, her cultivation could be said to be very weak.<br>She was actually only a Martial Emperor. Furthermore, she was only a rank one Martial Emperor.<br>In the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, that level of cultivation could be considered extremely weak.<br>However, that was not the important aspect that Chu Feng was focused on. His focus was fixed onto this old woman&rsquo;s illness.<br>Upon seeing her, without even waiting for the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master to say anything, Chu Feng walked up toward her and began to stabilize her illness.<br>As the saying goes, an expert&rsquo;s ability will be revealed the moment they act.<br>Once Chu Feng started, he immediately caused the gaze of the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master to change. All of his misgivings and hidden caution against Chu Feng were mostly dispelled at that moment.<br>The reason for that was because after Chu Feng started, not only did the Valley Master&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s face no longer possess that painful expression, her complexion also turned a lot more mild.<br>In fact, when Chu Feng stopped, the complexion of the mother of the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master had become rosy. Although she had not woken up and started to sleep, it was a very sound sleep.<br>Furthermore, all of this took Chu Feng less than an hour.<br>&ldquo;Young Hero, your art of healing is truly amazing,&rdquo; At that moment, the old lady who served the Valley Master&rsquo;s mother had a joyous expression on her face. She was unable to contain herself from praising Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, without mentioning other things, but merely for the fact that you have treated my mother&rsquo;s illness, I, Bai Xiuzhu, am extremely grateful,&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master actually turned to Chu Feng and bowed with clasped fists.<br>He, an individual with a status high and above Chu Feng&rsquo;s, was someone who would rarely make such a respectful gesture to another, much less someone with the status of a prisoner like Chu Feng.<br>However, he did such a thing. From that, it could be seen how much importance his mother held in his heart.<br>&ldquo;Lord Valley Master&rsquo;s words are too serious. I merely did what I was capable of,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I might as well get right to the point. Are you capable of curing my mother&rsquo;s illness?&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master asked.<br>&ldquo;Lord Valley Master&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s illness is indeed very dangerous. However, curing her illness is not that hard either. It is not an incurable disease.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, if a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist possessed exquisite ability in the art of healing and wholeheartedly treated her illness, they would also be able to cure her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Truly? But, all of the Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists I&rsquo;ve requested before all said that only an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist could treat her illness,&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master said.<br>&ldquo;Perhaps it is because they do not dare to attempt to cure her illness out of a fear of failure. However, Lord Valley Master, you can rest assured. I am able to cure your mother&rsquo;s illness. Furthermore, I do not need to wait until later. I can do it right now,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Right now? You&rsquo;re truly capable of curing her right now?&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master was in disbelief.<br>&ldquo;To be exact, I must cure her right now. If her treatment is to continue to be delayed, your mother&rsquo;s illness might end up being a danger to her life,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;A danger to her life?&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master frowned.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that Lord Valley Master didn&rsquo;t know that your mother&rsquo;s illness has reached a very dangerous level?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>The way Chu Feng saw it, this Lord Valley Master should know very well about his mother&rsquo;s illness being very serious. Else, he would not have been requesting for and petitioning Immortal-cloak World Spiritists so urgently.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, as long as you are able to cure my mother&rsquo;s illness, even if you have truly killed Chu Luyang, I can treat it as if nothing has happened.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, I will also provide you with rewards. You can make any demand of me,&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master said.<br>Sure enough, it was as Chu Feng had anticipated, the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master also knew that his mother&rsquo;s illness was very serious.<br>Else, he would not have not questioned Chu Feng, and instead directly proposed rewarding Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;We can set the matter of Chu Luyang aside till later. Right now, the treatment of Lord Valley Master&rsquo;s mother is the most urgent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, your mother&rsquo;s illness is truly special. Thus, I must use a special method to treat her illness. For that, I will need Lord Valley Master&rsquo;s assistance,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;How should I assist? Please tell me,&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master said.<br>&ldquo;I will need Lord Valley Master&rsquo;s blood. I am going to completely exchange your mother&rsquo;s blood with yours,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;No problem,&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master agreed without the slightest hesitation.<br><br></p></div>
