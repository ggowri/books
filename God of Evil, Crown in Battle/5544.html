        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Jie Tian has cleared the trial and received the chief elder&rsquo;s acknowledgment too, so he is accorded the highest privileges as well. It&rsquo;s just that&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>The leader of the group trailed off halfway through his words.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Continue speaking. Unless you think that I am not privy to information you have access to?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Definitely not! I&rsquo;ll be forthright then. I heard that Lord Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er is a kind person, but Lord Jie Tian is a harsh man who has killed quite a few of our brothers now. Milord, we might be formation entities, but we have feelings and lives too. Even the chief elder has said that we&rsquo;re no different from humans other than how we were born. However, Lord Jie Tian takes us to be pawns created by a formation. He doesn&rsquo;t think of us as living beings at all!&rdquo; the leader of the group exclaimed.</span><br><span>The others also nodded in agreement, subtly expressing their hostility toward Jie Tian. It was no wonder they had only mentioned Little Fishy when Chu Feng asked about the outsiders.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We are living beings too. Shouldn&rsquo;t the chief elder intervene if Jie Tian slaughters our people without sufficient justification?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The chief elder would usually step in, but it just so happens that Jie Tian is a capable man and we are in need of his help right now. The chief elder has no choice but to turn a blind eye to his tyranny,&rdquo; the leader of the group said with a sigh.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in need of his help? What do you need his help for?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>It didn&rsquo;t take him long to figure out the situation after chatting with the others&mdash;the Star Sea Realm wasn&rsquo;t a peaceful place either.</span><br><span>An evil power had been lurking in the Star Sea Realm since the Ancient Era. No one knew where this evil power came from, but it had always been a source of unease.</span><br><span>The elders of the Star Sea Realm had sought to destroy it when it first appeared, but they struggled to pinpoint its location. On top of that, the evil power suddenly vanished without a trace during the Ancient Era.</span><br><span>Ten thousand years ago, that evil power suddenly made a resurgence, and it had somehow gained the ability to seduce souls. With its newfound power, it converted many of the Star Sea Realm&rsquo;s elders into its lackeys. Its army only continued to grow with time, eventually growing into a formidable force that could stand against them now.</span><br><span>To make things worse, there was a place in the Immemorial Star Sea known as the Star Memorial Domain that couldn&rsquo;t be accessed by anyone. It was rumored that it contained the Immemorial Star Sea&rsquo;s key formation core and tremendous power.</span><br><span>But somehow, the traitors that had defected to the evil power were suddenly able to access the Star Memorial Domain, which posed a huge threat. It terrified them to think about what the evil power would do once it gained full control over the Star Memorial Domain, the life of the Star Sea Realm.</span><br><span>The chief elder was frustrated by the matter, but there was nothing he could do since the Star Memorial Domain was only accessible to those who had cleared the trial.</span><br><span>Fortunately, Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er cleared the trial shortly after and gained access rights to the Star Memorial Domain. Following her, Jie Tian cleared the trial too. Since then, the two of them had been constantly entering the Star Memorial Domain to clear away the traitors lurking in there.</span><br><span>It was also in view of this that the chief elder turned a blind eye to Jie Tian&rsquo;s tyranny.</span><br><span>Putting aside Jie Tian&rsquo;s character, he was indeed an amazing prodigy. His accomplishments in the Star Memorial Domain surpassed even that of Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er result in the trial is superior to Lord Jie Tian&rsquo;s, but Lord Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er is a cultivator whereas Lord Jie Tian is a world spiritist. Entering the Star Memorial Domain requires formation armor, so it&rsquo;s more advantageous to Lord Jie Tian. Naturally, his accomplishments are greater than Lord Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s too,&rdquo; the person replied in indignation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;World spiritist? Chu Feng, could Jie Tian be from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Seems so, but I have never heard of his name before,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied Eggy in his mind before turning his attention back to the others. &ldquo;Do you know how strong Jie Tian is?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s beyond what we know, but there&rsquo;s no doubt that he&rsquo;s an incredible prodigy given how he was able to clear the trial,&rdquo; a person in the group said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What about the evil power? Has anyone seen it before?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>Unfortunately, no one in the group knew much about the evil power. In fact, there was hardly anyone in the Star Sea Realm who had seen it in person before. Even the traitors they captured claimed that they had never seen the true face of the evil power.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, could the evil power have something to do with that assimilation formation you encountered earlier?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;From the looks of it, the usual formation entities in the Star Sea Realm strictly obey rules passed down through traditions. I don&rsquo;t think they would hurt outsiders for no reason. The evil power seeking to control the Immemorial Star Sea is the variable shaking things up,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ey. It looks like it isn&rsquo;t safe anywhere. Why is there such an uproar in the Immemorial Star Sea?&rdquo; Eggy lamented.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped. Where there&rsquo;s life, there&rsquo;s also war. This holds true not just for humans but animals and insects too. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the evil power is. As long as it dares to cross my path, I&rsquo;ll make sure that it suffers great misfortune!&rdquo; Chu Feng said confidently.</span><br><span>Eggy sweetly smiled at those words. She liked how adamant he was.</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>Soon, Chu Feng arrived at a humongous city with a simplistic design that focused solely on practicality, evident from how it looked like a giant lump of metal from the outside. It was made out of an extremely powerful formation that was far beyond his current reach.</span><br><span>Even though he had already reached God-cloak World Spiritist, he still felt like a countryside bumpkin when gazing upon the city and the world around him. He couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder who was the person behind the Immemorial Star Sea.</span><br></p></div>
