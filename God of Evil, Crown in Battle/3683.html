        <h1>Chapter 3682</h1>
        <div> - Surpassing Chu Xuanyuan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;No matter what, you people are somewhat reputed. Are you all planning to bully a person of the younger generation like myself with numbers and strength?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked that Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s expert.<br>&ldquo;Even if I am to die, I should be allowed a death that I can accept. Is there anyone of the same cultivation that is willing to come and fight me?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all startled upon hearing those words. No one had expected Chu Feng to put forth such a request when faced with enemies that he could not defeat.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Do you all not dare?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you all only know how to bully the weak with numbers and stronger cultivations?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that no one responded to his calls, Chu Feng&rsquo;s tone grew even more mocking.<br>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t we dare?&rdquo;<br>An expert from the Blood-devouring Hall smiled. Then, he turned to the cultivators standing behind them, &ldquo;Is there any rank five Exalted that dares to battle Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, allow me.&rdquo;<br>Once he raised the question, a man actually answered the call.<br>That man had a middle-aged appearance. He was dressed in well-fitting clothes, and appeared very extraordinary.<br>One could tell from a glance that he was no ordinary individual.<br>As for his appearance, he was indeed an extraordinary individual. He was a rank five Exalted expert.<br>An existence of his cultivation would not stand out among the numerous martial cultivation experts present.<br>However, should he be placed in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, his cultivation would be top rated, and he would be capable of showing disdain for the majority of experts.<br>Apart from the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, likely no one would dare to challenge an existence like him.<br>Precisely because that man was so extraordinary, when he said that he would face Chu Feng in battle, the spectators from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm and the Chu Heavenly Clansmen all began to worry deeply for Chu Feng.<br>Although his current cultivation was that of a rank five Exalted, it was only obtained with the power of his Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s actual cultivation was only that of a rank three Exalted. That man, on the other hand, was different. He was an actual rank five Exalted. His cultivation was something that he had obtained through training.<br>Faced with an expert of such caliber, the crowd were very uncertain as to whether or not Chu Feng would be able to handle him.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>After that man stood forth, he did not bother with any superfluous words, and directly revealed his Immortal Armament sword and pointed it at Chu Feng. &ldquo;Chu Feng, listen carefully. I am called Wu Jun. My cultivation is that of a rank five Exalted. I am also a Divine Body. I am able to increase my cultivation to that of a rank six Exalted. However, for the sake of fairness, I am not going to increase my cultivation. Instead, I will face you, a rank five Exalted, using only my rank five Exalted cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to die by my sword, make sure not to say that I&rsquo;ve bullied you.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng laughed with contempt. He said, &ldquo;If you have the ability, then go ahead and use it, instead of spouting all this nonsense.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph. Arrogant brat, your personality is exactly the same as your father's. Although I failed to defeat your father back then, I will have you die by my hands today!&rdquo;<br>Following a furious shout, a sword aura swept forth. That Wu Jun had flown out from the crowd.<br>He was very smart, and did not directly charge towards Chu Feng. He was not planning to meet Chu Feng head-on with the weapon in his hand.<br>The reason for that was because he had discovered that what Chu Feng was holding was an Incomplete Exalted Armament, and not an Immortal Armament.<br>Knowing that his weapon was at a disadvantage and wanting to defeat Chu Feng, Wu Jun decided to unleash an Immortal Technique before even approaching Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Eight giant pythons appeared in midair, each one measuring a thousand meters long.<br>As they moved their bodies in midair, even space itself started shivering.<br>At that moment, the eight giant pythons all had their mouths wide open. From eight different directions, they rushed to attack Chu Feng.<br>Originally, that Wu Jun was worried, because Chu Feng would be able to dodge this Immortal Technique should he attempt to do so.<br>However, he discovered that Chu Feng had no intention of dodging the attack. When he saw that the eight giant pythons had reached their attack range, the corners of Wu Jun&rsquo;s mouth rose into a pleased smile.<br>Wu Jun felt that Chu Feng would not be able to avoid the eight pythons at such a distance. Only death awaited him.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng swept out with his arm.<br>Then, eight streams of sword aura flew out from the weapon in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand. In an instant, the eight giant pythons were all beheaded.<br>&ldquo;This guy?!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, Wu Jun grew tense. He knew very well that the Immortal Technique he'd used to attack Chu Feng was no ordinary Immortal Technique. Instead, it was his strongest ability, his trump card.<br>His trump card was immediately defeated by Chu Feng???<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really able to increase your cultivation to rank six Exalted?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice was heard.<br>After hearing that voice, Wu Jun&rsquo;s expression changed enormously. Frightened, his body shivered.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice came from behind him. Furthermore, that voice was extremely close.<br>When he looked to the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, he discovered that there was no trace of Chu Feng where he'd previously stood.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>Sensing that the situation was bad, he immediately attempted to escape.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before he could move, he felt a stinging pain in his dantian. He lowered his head and saw that a sword had pierced through his dantian from behind.<br>It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng was standing behind him.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng waved his arm and sliced Wu Jun in two.<br>Wu Jun&rsquo;s soul was also destroyed in the process.<br>In merely a single exchange, Chu Feng had killed a rank five Exalted-level expert with his sword.<br>&ldquo;So fast! What strong battle power!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, the rank five Exalted that were thinking about fighting Chu Feng all quietly put away the weapons in their hands.<br>From the earlier confrontation, they were able to tell that while Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was that of a rank five Exalted, his battle power was infinitely close to that of a rank six Exalted.<br>Not to mention fighting him one on one, even if all the rank five Exalted decided to attack him together, they would find it very difficult to defeat him.<br>&ldquo;Amazing. Never would I have imagined Chu Feng to have progressed to such a level in such a short period of time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With his battle power, likely no one in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm besides the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief can match him, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng has already surpassed his father in his youth!!!&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s capability, many people from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were completely stunned.<br>They all felt that Chu Feng had surpassed his father, Chu Xuanyuan.<br>Their reactions were understandable. After all, when Chu Xuanyuan had left the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, he was only twenty-nine years old. At that time, he had already reached the summit of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s martial cultivation world.<br>If they were to ignore the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, who had suddenly gained a peak Exalted-level cultivation, then Chu Feng would also be standing at the apex of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm as a person of the younger generation.<br>That said, after witnessing how powerful he was, the crowd felt even more grief.<br>Likely, a genius like him would never reappear in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Instead, a genius like him would be killed.<br>That was something that the great majority of the people on the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm did not wish to witness.<br></p></div>
