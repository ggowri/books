        <h1>Chapter 3870</h1>
        <div> - Hidden Location<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints began to explore the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>At the beginning, they were extremely careful. However, they were soon shocked to discover that there were no traps in the tomb.<br>Furthermore, from their exploration, they discovered that their map was real.<br>The layout of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb was identical to their map.<br>With this, Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints were simply akin to fish that had returned to water.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>However, soon, difficulties arose.<br>Although the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb did not have any traps, and their map had also recorded regions containing treasures, they discovered that there was a gate when they arrived at a place containing treasures.<br>That gate was simply impregnable and unbreachable. Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints were completely helpless before it.<br>Furthermore, they later discovered that such an unbreachable gate was present at every single treasure-containing location.<br>&ldquo;What are we to do now? We&rsquo;ve wracked our brains and finally gotten in here, yet we've ended up being unable to obtain anything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Soon, the people from the All-heaven Sect will arrive. At that time, we&rsquo;ll have to watch helplessly as they take away all the treasures from this place.&rdquo; The Mystic Cave Saints became extremely anxious.<br>They had attempted multiple methods to breach the gates.<br>They had even used some powerful treasures in their attempts. However, without exception, they had all failed.<br>&ldquo;Let me see that map again." said Chu Feng.<br>Although they did not know what he planned to do, the Mystic Cave Saints still handed the map over to him again.<br>Chu Feng had seen the map earlier. He had also memorized all the details of the map.<br>The reason why he requested to see the map again was because he wanted to confirm one thing -- he wanted to confirm his guess.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough. It&rsquo;s as I thought, there&rsquo;s no such easy thing in the world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With how powerful the barrier outside the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb was, how could there not be any traps inside?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is simply unreasonable. And now&hellip; I finally understand why that&rsquo;s the case.&rdquo;<br>After seeing the map again, a smile of complete realization appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, did you discover something?&rdquo; the Mystic Cave Saints hurriedly asked.<br>&ldquo;A corresponding treasure is required to breach this gate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You all have told me that the All-heaven Sect, for the sake of opening the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb, has prepared for many years, and obtained many treasures capable of opening this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I suspect that among the treasures they&rsquo;ve obtained are the keys to open these gates,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We&rsquo;ve also thought that to be the case. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re worrying.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We entered this place ahead of time because we wanted to seize the opportunity to obtain the treasures before them. However, if we&rsquo;re unable to do anything, it would mean that we&rsquo;ve entered in vain.&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not necessarily the case. Since we&rsquo;re able to enter here ahead of time, it means that we still have the chance to gain a decisive opportunity.&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, exactly what did you discover? Stop beating around the bush and tell us directly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right, right, right. Brother Asura, quickly tell us.&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints became impatient.<br>&ldquo;I feel that even though the Great Monster Slayer Emperor has heavily guarded his tomb, he actually hoped that his treasures could be obtained by others. Otherwise, there would simply be no need for him to make things so complicated. He could very well bring those treasures to a place that no one knew about and hide them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is precisely because he wanted to leave his treasures to future generations that he left things that could breach the defenses he set up.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are only two ways to obtain the treasures he left behind.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The first method would be to obtain the corresponding keys and use them to open those gates.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If my guess is correct, a key will only be able to open a single gate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the second method, it would be rather remarkable. That would be&hellip; obtaining the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s acknowledgement.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should one be able to obtain his acknowledgement, all of the gates here will open." said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, in that case, how does one obtain his acknowledgement?&rdquo; asked the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a place where one can obtain his acknowledgement. Follow me.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he began to lead the way, and the Mystic Cave Saints immediately followed him.<br>The Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb was enormous. Even though they had only explored a region of the tomb, they knew about the structure of the entire tomb due to the fact that they had a map.<br>However, the location that Chu Feng was leading them to was a place not recorded on the map.<br>He had brought them to a long corridor. The long corridor was very well-hidden.<br>Although there was nothing stopping them from entering it, it would not be easy for them to discover it had it not been for Chu Feng showing them the way.<br>The reason for that was because the corridor was simply too inconspicuous, and too easily overlooked.<br>Even if one were to discover the long corridor, they would still overlook it, since it did not appear to contain any treasures.<br>In other words, had it not been for Chu Feng guiding them, even if the Mystic Cave Saints had discovered the entrance to the corridor, they would not have attempted to enter it.<br>At least, they would not decide to explore it before they&rsquo;d explored the entire Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>The long corridor was very narrow. The further they went, the more shabby it became.<br>Furthermore, as they went deeper, they began to feel a dangerous aura. That aura brought unease to the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>However, Chu Feng did not slow down at all. He continued to rapidly proceed onward.<br>Strangely, even though the long corridor was emitting a dangerous aura, even though that dangerous aura felt much stronger the deeper they went, they did not encounter any dangers the entire time.<br>Finally, they passed through that long and narrow corridor.<br>At the instant they passed through the long corridor, the eyes of the Mystic Cave Saints started shining.<br>They looked to Chu Feng with even greater admiration in their eyes.<br></p></div>
