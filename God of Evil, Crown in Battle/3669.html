        <h1>Chapter 3668</h1>
        <div> - Strong Will<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The instant Chu Feng grabbed the droplet, lightning visible to the naked eye emerged on his palm, and soon covered his entire body.<br>Like a myriad of blades, the lightning traveled back and forth through Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>Due to the enormous pain brought by the traveling lightning, Chu Feng was unable to stand firm. Soon, he lost his balance and fell to the ground.<br>However, the pain was simply too strong. After falling, Chu Feng began to roll back and forth on the ground.<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s reaction, Yin Zhuanghong revealed a trace of doubt in her eyes.<br>She did not believe Chu Feng. She felt that it was very possible that he was pretending to be in pain to deceive her so that she would back off.<br>Thus, Yin Zhuanghong also walked forward and grabbed the other droplet.<br>The instant she grabbed the droplet, she knew that she had been mistaken. Chu Feng had not deceived her.<br>Like Chu Feng, Yin Zhuanghong was also covered by lightning.<br>Then, she too was unable to keep her balance, and fell to the ground.<br>Her extremely beautiful face grew fiercely distorted. It could be seen that she was in enormous pain.<br>This sort of painful situation lasted for a long while before finally improving.<br>After the pain subsided, both Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong became extremely weak, and were panting for air.<br>Yin Zhuanghong raised her head and looked at the protective formation around the Death God&rsquo;s Edge. A trace of fear appeared in her cold eyes.<br>It was not that she was cowardly. Instead, the pain from earlier was simply too fresh in her memory.<br>She did not wish to endure that pain again.<br>&ldquo;Step~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Step~~~&rdquo;<br>To her surprise, right at that moment, Chu Feng not only stood up, but he also began walking towards the protective formation.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had not given up, Yin Zhuanghong said, &ldquo;Have you gone mad?&rdquo;<br>Shock filled her face, as she had personally experienced the power of that protective formation. A single droplet was already able to torture her to a state of near collapse. If one was to immerse oneself in the protective formation, what sort of terrifying torture would that be?<br>Just thinking about it caused her body to tremble.<br>Yet, even though the situation was so dire, Chu Feng actually still chose to enter the protective formation?<br>If this wasn&rsquo;t going insane, what could it be?<br>&ldquo;I must obtain that weapon,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Perhaps you will live after entering that place. However, you&rsquo;ll definitely be driven insane by the torture. Think it over properly. Is it really worth it for you to do all that for a single weapon?&rdquo; asked Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng turned around.<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression, Yin Zhuanghong stood there, stunned. There was a slight smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth it.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng suddenly leapt forward. Like an arrow, he flew straight toward the protective formation.<br>Chu Feng was trying to use the inertia of his movement to quickly penetrate the protective formation and take hold of the Death God&rsquo;s Edge directly.<br>However, the protective formation had an obstructive power. Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s speed was extremely fast, he was immediately stopped by the protective formation the moment he came in contact with it.<br>Not only that, but he was also knocked backwards.<br>Although he was knocked back, his body came in contact with a great amount of the liquid within the grand formation. As such, unavoidably, his body was invaded by the power of the protective formation.<br>This time around, the pain Chu Feng was withstanding far surpassed the pain from before.<br>It took a long while for the lightning that had enveloped his body to dissipate. It was only after the lightning had dissipated for quite some time that Chu Feng managed to stand up.<br>After standing back up, without any hesitation, Chu Feng began to walk toward that protective formation again.<br>Merely, this time around, Chu Feng no longer rushed into the protective formation. Instead, he was slowly walking towards it.<br>When Chu Feng came in contact with the protective formation, the lightning once again enveloped his body.<br>&ldquo;Eeeeahhhh!!!!!&rdquo;<br>Screams of miserable pain sounded from his mouth.<br>One could see that his entire body was currently covered in lightning. In miserable pain, his body was trembling violently.<br>However, this time around, Chu Feng managed to forcibly stabilize himself, and did not fall to the ground.<br>Clenching his teeth, the screams of pain soon faded.<br>Just like that Chu Feng began to slowly move into the protective formation.<br>&ldquo;How can this be? Could it be that the power of that protective formation is not as terrifying as I imagined it to be?&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng moving through the protective formation, Yin Zhuanghong immediately got up and arrived before it. Testing her doubt, she began to walk toward the protective formation.<br>She was truly fond of the Death God&rsquo;s Edge, and did not wish to miss out on the opportunity to obtain it.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, the instant she touched that protective formation, she immediately fell paralyzed to the ground. The miserable and unbearable pain once again assaulted her, causing her to immediately leave the protective formation by crawling out.<br>After crawling out from the protective formation, cold sweat covered Yin Zhuanghong. Even though the lightning had disappeared from her body, she was still trembling violently.<br>When she looked at the protective formation again, her face was filled with lingering fear.<br>After experiencing it for herself, she realized that it wasn&rsquo;t that the protective formation&rsquo;s power grew weaker. On the contrary, the power of the protective formation was even more terrifying.<br>Yet, Chu Feng was actually able to force himself to persist?<br>How did he do that?<br>&ldquo;That guy, what sort of willpower is that?&rdquo;<br>Yin Zhuanghong looked towards Chu Feng again, and discovered that he was still inside the protective formation. As she saw him slowly proceeding onward, admiration and shock filled her eyes.<br>Yin Zhuanghong did not leave the top floor. Instead, she continued to watch Chu Feng, watch him withstand the power of the protective formation, and gradually approach the Death God&rsquo;s Edge.<br>As time passed, the gaze that Yin Zhuanghong was looking at Chu Feng with grew more and more complicated.<br>It was precisely because she had personally experienced how terrifying that formation was that Yin Zhuanghong knew best how difficult of a task it was for him to move in that protective formation.<br>Finally, Chu Feng arrived before the Death God&rsquo;s Edge. He extended his hand and grabbed it.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>At the instant Chu Feng touched the Death God&rsquo;s Edge, the protective formation immediately dispersed.<br>With a &lsquo;putt,&rsquo; Chu Feng collapsed to the ground.<br>The current Chu Feng had been changed beyond recognition.<br>His flesh was completely lacerated. It seemed like he had been stabbed by countless blades. Furthermore, in addition to the mutilation, one could even get a whiff a charred smell from him.<br>Moreover, after collapsing to the ground, Chu Feng did not stand back up.<br>Seeing that he did not stand back up, Yin Zhuanghong asked, &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng did not respond to her question. Thus, Yin Zhuanghong walked over to him. It was only at that moment that she discovered that while Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes were open, he had lost consciousness.<br>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve already lost consciousness.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You were actually able to continue onward to reach the Death God&rsquo;s Edge even though you&rsquo;d lost consciousness?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is this a subconscious action?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You, exactly how badly did you want this Death God&rsquo;s Edge?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the unconscious Chu Feng, Yin Zhuanghong felt completely shocked.<br>At that moment, she looked at the Death God&rsquo;s Edge.<br>Even though Chu Feng had lost consciousness, he was still holding onto the Death God&rsquo;s Edge tightly, as if he was deeply afraid that someone would try to snatch it from him.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that there is an extraordinary sentiment between you and your world spirit.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the current Chu Feng, the complicated expression in Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s eyes grew even stronger.<br></p></div>
