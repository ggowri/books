        <h1>Chapter 5445: The Trial Begins</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;What the hell! How is he that arrogant?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect Chu Feng to be so domineering. It&rsquo;s like he doesn&rsquo;t have eyes for the Pill Dao Immortal Sect at all!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Many people were surprised by Chu Feng&rsquo;s speech. Some of the juniors even looked at him in admiration. They had known that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t one to be meddled with as he had the protection of the Totem Nine Daoists, but they didn&rsquo;t expect him to be so domineering as well.</span><br><span>They felt cathartic seeing how the Pill Dao Immortal Sect was unable to put Chu Feng under its thumb and was instead getting humiliated. While they had nothing to do with this grudge, many of them had their fair share of woes dealing with the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.</span><br><span>They had also dreamed of standing up against the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, but they didn&rsquo;t have the strength to do so. They admired Chu Feng&rsquo;s bravery in doing what they were unable to do, and they saw him as a hero who stood up against oppressors.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why are no juniors from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect saying anything? Are they really afraid?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is that for real? Isn&rsquo;t Jia Chengying here? Is he really afraid of Chu Feng?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd keenly noticed how none of the juniors dared to respond to Chu Feng&rsquo;s provocation, which made them wonder if the juniors of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect were truly afraid of him.</span><br><span>On the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s warship, the woman who had crossed blows with Chu Feng earlier said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d advise your juniors not to enter the Infernal Realm.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jia Chengying&rsquo;s cheeks twitched upon hearing those words. He knew that Chu Feng was a lunatic who wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to kill him, which was why he wouldn&rsquo;t be so foolish as to step into the Infernal Realm.</span><br><span>Jia Lingyi understood that too, but there were far too many people looking at them now. It would sully their reputation if they refused to accept Chu Feng&rsquo;s challenge.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You bunch of useless things. Do I need to teach you how to clean up the mess you made?!&rdquo; Jia Lingyi howled at those who had provoked Chu Feng earlier via voice </span><span>transmission.</span><br><span>Those people lowered their heads in shame. They had no idea how to wrap up the situation. Under normal circumstances, they would have sent their juniors in to teach Chu Feng a lesson, but the problem was that none of their juniors dared to accept his challenge!</span><br><span>What were they supposed to do in such a situation?</span><br><span>In the end, Jia Lingyi stepped forward and said, &ldquo;Stop putting on airs, Chu Feng. Do you honestly think that our juniors would be afraid of you? If you truly wish to challenge us, come out and our juniors will face you fair and square. However, we won&rsquo;t be sending our juniors into the Infernal Realm. As the World Spiritist Painter has said, this is your fortuitous encounter. We, the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, don&rsquo;t need your charity.&rdquo;</span><br><span>That provided an excuse for the juniors of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect not to enter the Infernal Realm, albeit a forced one.</span><br><span>Those words sparked a commotion. The crowd wondered if Chu Feng was so powerful that even Jia Chengying was afraid of him. That shouldn&rsquo;t have been the case, as Chu Feng should have only been at pinnacle Martial Exalted level, whereas Jia Chengying had already reached Half-God level.</span><br><span>Otherwise, Chu Feng would have participated in the early Half-God instead of the late Martial Exalted level category in the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Trial of the Strongest.</span><br><span>In fact, there should be plenty of juniors in the Pill Dao Immortal Sect who were stronger than Chu Feng. It was bewildering to them that none of them dared to enter the Infernal Realm. Could it be that Chu Feng had an ace up his sleeves?</span><br><span>By this point, it was already clear to the crowd that the juniors of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect were afraid of Chu Feng, though they didn&rsquo;t know why they were afraid of him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It looks like your juniors have inherited the great values of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&mdash;gutlessness,&rdquo; Chu Feng mocked the juniors of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.</span><br><span>The faces of those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect turned livid.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of running your mouth? Why don&rsquo;t you come out and prove yourself instead?&rdquo; Jia Lingyi scoffed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m standing right here. If your juniors have guts, you are free to come in and confront me. Otherwise, you can come in yourself too&hellip; Ah, I forgot that you&rsquo;re too old for that. Aren&rsquo;t you glad that you have an excuse to justify your cowardice?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jia Lingyi didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng&rsquo;s mouth would be this nasty. No one had ever dared to insult her in such a manner.</span><br><span>Chu Feng then turned to the crowd and said, &ldquo;The Infernal Realm won&rsquo;t remain open for long. Hurry up and come in if you wish to give it a try.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Some of the bolder juniors entered the Infernal Realm, and the others quickly followed suit. In a matter of moments, tens of thousands of juniors had already entered the Infernal Realm.</span><br><span>There were far more juniors than that in the vicinity, but many of them were </span><span>apprehensive about crossing the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, so they chose to rather miss this opportunity. Only the bold ones stepped in.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, what should we do now?&rdquo;</span><br><span>While the juniors had entered the Infernal Realm, they had no idea what they had to do.</span><br><span>&ldquo;No rush. The Infernal Realm will provide us with hints very soon,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied calmly.</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>A sudden flash of light from the sky caught everyone&rsquo;s notice. The crowd immediately knew that the Infernal Realm was about to begin its trial.</span><br></p></div>
