        <div> - Seeing Old Friends<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the martial power that surrounded the girl had turned into countless swords under her control, and began to fly toward Chu Feng.<br>After successfully unleashing her attack, the girl revealed a smile on her face.<br>As a stranger had suddenly intruded upon the Misty Peak, that girl did not conceal her strength, and unleashed her strongest attack from the very start.<br>She felt that since the distance between her and Chu Feng was so close, Chu Feng would not even be able to dodge her attack should she be able to successfully unleash it. As such, he would undoubtedly be killed.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, at the moment when those swords were about to strike Chu Feng, they suddenly froze in midair.<br>&ldquo;This is?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, the smile on that girl&rsquo;s face immediately disappeared. Shock and unease immediately appeared in her quick-witted eyes.<br>She was unable to understand how her fatal attack would suddenly freeze in midair, and not listen to her command.<br>&ldquo;To have such a murderous heart at such a young age is not a good thing.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he gently flicked his finger. The next moment, the countless swords that had frozen before him instantly shattered.<br>&ldquo;...&rdquo;<br>At that moment, that young girl&rsquo;s expression changed enormously. She finally realized why her attack had frozen.<br>All of it was caused by the man before her.<br>As he possessed such power, he was most definitely not someone that she could handle.<br>Thus, without uttering a word, the girl immediately turned around and began to rapidly fly toward the main palace of the Misty Peak.<br>There were six people in the Misty Peak&rsquo;s main palace.<br>Amongst those six was a relatively old lady. She was the previous master of the Misty Peak, Lady Piaomiao.<br>As for the most beautiful-looking woman among the group, she was Lady Piaomiao&rsquo;s daughter, the current master of the Misty Peak, Qiushui Fuyan.<br>As for the other four people, although their looks were inferior to Qiushui Fuyan, they too were beauties.<br>The four of them were Lady Piaomiao&rsquo;s four personal disciples, Chun Wu, Xia Yu, Qiu Zhu and Dong Xue.<br>&ldquo;This is bad! This is bad!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a series of frantic shouts was heard. Following that, the entrance to the palace that was closed was kicked open.<br>It was that girl, she had run in and kicked the door open.<br>Seeing the girl, Qiushui Fuyan frowned and shouted at her, &ldquo;Ming Ye, what are you doing?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you informed that you are not to disturb us while we&rsquo;re having a meeting?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lady Master, this disciple didn&rsquo;t plan to disturb you all. However, someone has intruded upon our Misty Peak.&rdquo;<br>The girl by the name of Ming Ye hurriedly kneeled on the ground and spoke with grievance on her face.<br>&ldquo;What did you say? Someone has intruded upon our Misty Peak?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Qiushui Fuyan and the other five people all had a huge change in expression.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s already inside!&rdquo; That girl called Ming Ye said.<br>&ldquo;Already inside?&rdquo; Hearing those words, their expressions grew even uglier.<br>To be able to directly break through the formation and enter the Misty Peak, that person was most definitely not a nobody.<br>One must know that after the Blood Qilin that suddenly appeared was defeated by Chu Feng, there had never been another power that was capable of contending against the Misty Peak in the Eastern Sea Region.<br>Furthermore, no one dared to offend the Misty Peak.<br>Yet now, not only did someone intrude upon their Misty Peak&rsquo;s territory, but that person even managed to breach the defensive formation. This could only mean one thing: an enemy with ill-intentions had arrived.<br>&ldquo;Show the way,&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan said.<br>&ldquo;Big sister Fuyan, there&rsquo;s no need for that.&rdquo;<br>However, right when Qiushui Fuyan was planning to go out, a voice was suddenly heard.<br>At the same time as that voice was heard, a figure appeared in the palace hall.<br>Seeing this person, Qiushui Fuyan and the others were all stunned. However, immediately afterward, overwhelming joy appeared on their faces.<br>They were smiling so joyously that they were simply even happier than when they managed to make a breakthrough in cultivation.<br>The reason for that was because that person was none other than Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Impudent! You&rsquo;ve intruded upon our Misty Peak and dared to even enter our main palace! Watch as I kill you!&rdquo;<br>The girl by the name of Ming Ye did not notice the overjoyed expressions on Qiushui Fuyan and the others&rsquo; faces. Instead, she immediately took out her weapon the moment she saw Chu Feng and was planning to attack him.<br>Seeing this, Qiushui Fuyan shouted, &ldquo;Ming Ye, stop!&rdquo;<br>Then, she arrived before Ming ye and forcibly took away the weapon in her hand.<br>Then, she shouted, &ldquo;Ming Ye, do not be rude! Don&rsquo;t you know who he is?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master, he&hellip; who is he?&rdquo; Ming Ye asked.<br>&ldquo;Ming Ye, he is your idol, Chu Feng,&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan said.<br>&ldquo;Master, are you serious?! He&rsquo;s really Chu Feng?!&rdquo; Hearing those words, Ming Ye became extremely excited.<br>&ldquo;Why would master lie to you?&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, this lowly one is Ming Ye. I have admired you for three days already. Please accept my respect,&rdquo; suddenly, that Ming Ye half knelt on the ground and began to bow to Chu Feng.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng was bewildered. He had no idea when he got such an admirer. Furthermore, what was the business with the &lsquo;three days?&rsquo;<br>Soon enough, after chatting, Chu Feng discovered that Ming Ye was born in a remote location. She was someone that Qiushui Fuyan had discovered whilst traveling the four seas to search of an outstanding successor.<br>There was no need to doubt how talented that Ming Ye was. At such a young age, she was already a rank nine Martial Lord. One must know that even Qiushui Fuyan was only a Martial King.<br>However, it was also precisely because Qiushui Fuyan discovered Ming Ye in a remote location that Ming Ye did not know much about the Eastern Sea Region. As such, she had Qiushui Fuyan tell her things about the Eastern Sea Region the entire time.<br>When Ming Ye came to find out about Chu Feng&rsquo;s achievements, she started feeling endless admiration for Chu Feng, and declared him to be her idol. She declared that she would learn from Chu Feng and follow his example.<br>That said, it had only been three days since she declared Chu Feng to be her idol. That was the reason why she said that she had admired Chu Feng for three days.<br></p></div>
