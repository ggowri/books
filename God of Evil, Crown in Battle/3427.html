        <div> - The Disappeared Chu Feng<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Damn it. Could it be that I&rsquo;ve lost my freedom of movement after I obtained the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had awoken from the dream and regained consciousness.<br>However, he was frowning.<br>Although he was covered in light and appeared to be a humanoid body of light, his sight and hearing were completely fine.<br>As such, he was able to see and hear everything going on around him.<br>However, Chu Feng was surprised to discover that, apart from regaining consciousness, he was unable to move at all. His body was actually restricted. He was unable to even open his mouth to speak.<br>He was able to clearly sense that it was none other than the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak that was restricting his body.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body shifted. Once his body started to move, Grandmaster Liangqiu, Liangqiu Chengfeng and the others all revealed a huge change in their expression.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had instantly disappeared the moment he moved.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, why would young friend Chu Feng&hellip; disappear?&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan asked.<br>&ldquo;He has left. He is no longer here,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu said.<br>&ldquo;No longer here? Where has he gone?&rdquo; Queen Mother Fox Immortal asked.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu did not answer. He suddenly stood up and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave this place to you all.&rdquo;<br>Then, Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s body shifted, and he disappeared.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu left urgently. Everyone could tell that.<br>After Chu Feng disappeared, it was not only Grandmaster Liangqiu who became anxious. There was another person that became anxious. He was&hellip; Grandmaster Long Xuan.<br>&ldquo;Old Granny Fox Immortal, I&rsquo;m leaving these young friends to you all,&rdquo; After Grandmaster Long Xuan left those words, his body also shifted, and he disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Hey! Why are you in a rush too?&rdquo;<br>Queen Mother Fox Immortal spoke loudly. However, she did not receive a response from Grandmaster Long Xuan.<br>They all knew that Grandmaster Liangqiu, Grandmaster Long Xuan and Chu Feng had all left.<br>As for where they went, no one knew.<br>&hellip;...<br>Outside the Ice Summit. The place was already packed with people.<br>The great majority of the people were gathered there because of Exalted Heavenly Fate&rsquo;s prophecy.<br>Since the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist in the history of the Ancestral Martial Starfield was going to appear on the Ice Summit, they all wanted to know who that person was.<br>The crowd were all discussing spiritedly and guessing amongst themselves as to who that person would be.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother guessing, the answer is obvious, the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist will definitely be Linghu Hongfei. Apart from him, no one could possibly accomplish such a feat,&rdquo; Someone spoke with an expression of certainty.<br>That was actually what the majority of the people present thought.<br>After all, when thinking of the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist candidate, the first person that came to their minds was the person with the strongest talent.<br>Amongst the current younger generations, who besides Linghu Hongfei could possibly be capable of obtaining that title?<br>&ldquo;Whilst it is true that Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s talent in martial cultivation is very strong, it wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that he will become the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, Linghu Hongfei has already announced that he will not participate in this year&rsquo;s selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars. Thus, perhaps he&rsquo;s not here at all. If he didn&rsquo;t even come here, how could he be the Saint-cloak World Spiritist that will emerge on the Ice Summit?&rdquo; There were also people that had different opinions.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;ve also heard that Linghu Hongfei has announced that he will not participate in this year&rsquo;s selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars. In that case, it would mean that the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist would be someone else. Who could it be?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not Linghu Hongfei, it&rsquo;s very possible for it to be either Liangqiu Hongyue or her sister, Liangqiu Lanyue. Afterall, those sisters are Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s personal disciples. whilst I do not dare to speak about their other capabilities, they are definitely unmatched amongst the younger generations in terms of their world spirit techniques.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true, no? Don&rsquo;t you all forget about the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Linghu Yueyue. That girl&rsquo;s world spirit techniques are not at all inferior to the Liangqiu Sisters. In fact, her world spirit techniques might even be above the Liangqiu Sisters. After all, even Grandmaster Liangqiu wanted to take her as his disciple back then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are all wrong. Let me tell you all this, the one to become the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist isn&rsquo;t one of Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s two disciples, or Linghu Yueyue. Instead, it&rsquo;s someone that you all have never imagined.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, someone appeared among the crowd and rejected everyone&rsquo;s guesses.<br>&ldquo;Old Monster, what brought you here?&rdquo; Upon seeing that person, many people&rsquo;s expressions changed. As they were all people with status, they all knew one another. Thus, they all knew that person too.<br>&ldquo;How could this old man possibly miss out on this distinguished assembly?&rdquo; That old man said with a laugh.<br>&ldquo;Old Monster, I&rsquo;ve heard that you went to meet that Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s prophesied child.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, I&rsquo;ve heard that even Liangqiu Chengfeng went to meet the prophesied child. Could it be that that member of the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation, Wuma Shengjie, really possesses such exceptional talent?&rdquo;<br>The crowd began to voice questions.<br>The old man that had just arrived was the headmaster of the Kunmen Sect. He was known as Old Monster Kunmen.<br>Not long ago, he had gone to the Wuma Heavenly Clan and witnessed what had happened in the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s remnant.<br>It was precisely because he had witnessed what had happened that he rejected everyone&rsquo;s guesses.<br>&ldquo;Wuma Shengjie does possess exceptional talent. He is a demon-level genius rarely seen in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, during my journey to the Wuma Heavenly Clan, I met someone else. That child&rsquo;s talent is extremely powerful. He has obtained very high levels of attainments in both martial cultivation and world spirit techniques.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All the people that met him that day unanimously believed that he is the real prophesied child, the person who could compete against Linghu Hongfei.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He is shining brightly, and no longer capable of being covered up. Thus, I think that he must&rsquo;ve arrived here too, and will be destined to reveal his extraordinary talent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, this old man feels that if a person of the younger generation is to become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, it would be none other than him,&rdquo; Old Monster Kunmen said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? There&rsquo;s such a thing? Old Monster, why don&rsquo;t you tell us who that person is then?&rdquo;<br>Old Monster Kunmen&rsquo;s words caught the interest of the crowd. One by one, they looked at him with curiosity.<br>Sensing the curiosity of the crowd, Old Monster Kunmun smiled in a deliberately mystifying manner. Then, he slowly said the following words, &ldquo;Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What? Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, Chu Feng?!&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing those words, including the people that knew Old Monster Kunmen, even those that did not know him that were in the vicinity turned their gazes toward him.<br>The reason for that was because if anyone were to mention the name &lsquo;Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo; in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, they would definitely capture the crowd&rsquo;s attention.<br></p></div>
