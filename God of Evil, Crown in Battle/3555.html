        <div> - Surpass Chu Xuanyuan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s different?&rdquo; Chu Feng was puzzled.<br>&ldquo;Mn&hellip; how do I explain it? It&rsquo;s like no matter how far you&rsquo;ve reached, you are still willing to talk with me in such a manner without putting on any airs at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is something that others would not do. For the great majority of people, they will become arrogant and untouchable after they reach greater heights, going as far as to alienate their old friends,&rdquo; said Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;That sort of people that you speak of should number quite a few, no?&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Not few at all,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. After all, I will not act like that. We are friends, and will remain close friends,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Since we&rsquo;re close friends, why don&rsquo;t you give me a gift?&rdquo; said Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Sure. What do you need? I&rsquo;ll go find it for you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You can give me whatever. As long as it&rsquo;s not something important, anything is fine,&rdquo; said Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Hmm, let me think,&rdquo; Chu Feng began to ponder. He was really wondering what inside his Cosmos Sack would be most suitable to give to Xia Yun&rsquo;er as a present.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Is it this difficult to think of something to give me? How about this&hellip;&rdquo; As Xia Yun&rsquo;er spoke, she removed her hairpin, &ldquo;just engrave your name onto it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could this do? This wouldn&rsquo;t be a gift from me. How about&hellip; let me give you an Immortal Armament?&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Who would want your Immortal Armament? Just engrave your name onto it,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er pushed the hairpin towards Chu Feng.<br>Helpless, Chu Feng was forced to do as she demanded, and engraved his name onto the hairpin.<br>&ldquo;There. I&rsquo;m going to consider this your gift to me,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er did not put the hairpin back on her head. Instead, she carefully put it away.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not too suitable, no? That was clearly yours to begin with, how could you consider it a gift from me just because I engraved my name onto it?&rdquo; Chu Feng was confused.<br>&ldquo;Look at yourself. The rate of your growth is simply too fast. If you are to continue to grow like this, the Ancestral Martial Starfield will likely not be able to contain you anymore.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, you are someone who possesses special significance,&rdquo; said Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;What special significance?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand. You&rsquo;re going to become the basis of my bragging.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the future, when I get old, when my face is covered in wrinkles, when I become an old woman, I will be able to tell my grandchildren&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;... look, you all know how powerful that Chu Feng is, no? Back then, when I got to know him, he was only a mere True Immortal. His cultivation was inferior to even mine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I will have no proof for my story, and they will definitely not believe me. At that time, I will be able to take out this hairpin to prove that I know you.&rdquo;<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er raised her little face and placed her little hands behind her back as she took nimble strides forward. Her skirt fluttered about, and there was a look of complacence on her exceptionally beautiful face.<br>She had a look of unfettered imagination. It was as if she was truly able to see that scene, and was really planning to do as she said she would do.<br>&ldquo;If they do not believe you, you can come and find me. At that time, I will personally tell them, and have them know that their grandma was simply unmatched back then, and was someone who fascinated all of the men of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Enough of your nonsense,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er rolled her eyes at Chu Feng. However, the corners of her lips involuntarily rose into a smile.<br>As for Chu Feng, he smiled even more joyfully. He was still imagining how he would boast to Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandchildren in the future.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng,&rdquo; Suddenly, Xia Yun&rsquo;er called Chu Feng&rsquo;s name in a very serious manner.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to her.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a fragrant aroma assailed Chu Feng&rsquo;s nostrils as a soft body pounced into his bosom.<br>It was Xia Yun&rsquo;er. Not only had Xia Yun&rsquo;er thrown herself onto Chu Feng, but her arms were tightly wrapped around him, and her little face was dug into his chest.<br>Chu Feng did not move. Standing there motionlessly, he did not reject Xia Yun&rsquo;er, and did not push her away.<br>This sort of situation lasted for a short period of time before Xia Yun&rsquo;er voluntarily let go of Chu Feng. She tried her best to calm herself, looked to Chu Feng and smiled. &ldquo;This hug is also something that I can brag about in the future.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Haha. I can also brag about having been a man that has hugged the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t brag about that. Otherwise, I&rsquo;d be beaten to death by others,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a mischievous smile.<br>&ldquo;Well then, you can go back now,&rdquo; After saying those words, Xia Yun&rsquo;er turned around and began to walk back toward the others.<br>That said, the Holy Daughter was no longer flying in the sky. Instead, she was leaping and skipping as she walked. She no longer appeared scheming, and looked purely like a little girl that was very content and joyous.<br>Seeing Xia Yun&rsquo;er like that, a slight wave was raised in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart.<br>Chu Feng was no fool. How could he not be able to tell what Xia Yun&rsquo;er was thinking?<br>Unfortunately, Chu Feng had only considered Xia Yun&rsquo;er a friend, and nothing else.<br>By the time Chu Feng and Xia Yun&rsquo;er returned, everyone had entered the Starfall Holy Stone.<br>After seeing Xia Yun&rsquo;er off, and seeing her enter the Starfall Holy Stone, Chu Feng released his spirit power, and began to set up a concealment formation.<br>In order to prevent the people from the Blood-devouring Demon Clan from discovering the Starfall Holy Stone, Chu Feng was extremely focused when setting up the concealment formation.<br>Being so focused when setting up the concealment formation, Chu Feng ended up exposing his spirit power. Even the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak could be faintly seen.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power, how could it be so strong? If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, that seems to be&hellip; Saint level spirit power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that Chu Feng is now a Saint-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistake, that is indeed Saint level spirit power. Furthermore, the faintly visible world spiritist cloak on his body is also no small matter. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, that should be a treasure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truly unfathomable. It has only been a short period of time, yet he has not only become an Exalted, but he has also become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng setting up his concealment formation, the people inside the Starfall Holy Stone were all unable to remain calm.<br>With great difficulty, they&rsquo;d finally accepted the fact that Chu Feng had become a rank one Exalted. However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s identity as a Saint-cloak World Spiritist had once again shattered the crowd&rsquo;s impression of him.<br>&ldquo;Terrifying. Is this what a demon-level genius is? As expected of Chu Hanxian&rsquo;s grandson, Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son. He has inherited their demon-level talent,&rdquo; Elder Xing Yi praised with a look of admiration.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, he&rsquo;s truly powerful. Sometimes, the disparity between people is extraordinarily large. Even if we do not want to, we have no choice but to admit that we&rsquo;re inferior to others,&rdquo; Even the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master gasped with admiration.<br>&ldquo;That said, compared to Chu Xuanyuan, I feel that this Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent is even more terrifying,&rdquo; said the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Hall master Gui, why do you say that?&rdquo; the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master asked. The other experts also turned their curiosity-filled eyes to him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanyuan had revealed his talent since his youth, and had been uncontainable ever since. Because he was able to accomplish things that were impossible for others, all of his achievements and deeds could be described as legendary.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for Chu Feng, compared to his father who shone brighter than the sun, Chu Feng&rsquo;s starting point was not only extremely low, it could even be said to be very incompetent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When he was born, he was deemed to be unable to cultivate, and was humiliated by others because of that. From that humiliation, his father unleashed a massacre. With that, he ended up being expelled from the Chu Heavenly Clan as an infant.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although he managed to return to the Chu Heavenly Clan and was, in addition to being able to cultivate, also quite talented, he was only a True Immortal when he first returned to the Ancestral Martial Starfield. At that time, not to mention the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, merely among the younger generations of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, there were plenty of people that were stronger than him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it has only been how long? In such a short period of time, not only were the people of the younger generation incapable of competing against him anymore, even we became far inferior to him. Such a rapid speed of growth is simply beyond common sense.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;From this, one can well imagine what sort of level his future accomplishments will reach. One can say that his future will be simply inestimable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although he was not heaven-defying since he was young like his father was, the talent that he has revealed in this short period of time seems to be even more terrifying than Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s talent,&rdquo; the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said.<br>&ldquo;Now that you mention it, that seems to really be the case.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Logically, as we are all people that have witnessed Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s growth, we should be able to have some tolerance for demon-level geniuses.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, after witnessing Chu Feng&rsquo;s transformation, we still felt utter disbelief. Likely, it is because his growth is simply too fast.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd all began to express their agreement with the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s words.<br>Seeing that the experts present were all evaluating Chu Feng so highly, the impression that Chu Feng had the people of the younger generation rose to a higher level.<br>Even though they were unable to be certain, the people of the younger generation were unable to keep themselves from wondering if the Chu Feng they met on that day would really be able to surpass Chu Xuanyuan, whose name still shook the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield?<br></p></div>
