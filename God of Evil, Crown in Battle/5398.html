        <div><span>: How Is That Person?</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;The sealing formation on the Asura Demon Tower is intended to seal demonic nature. It&rsquo;s only normal for the Asura Demon Tower to be pushed to the brink of collapse if a sufficiently powerful demonic nature appears,&rdquo; the woman in the hut said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, are you saying that Chu Feng&rsquo;s demonic nature is even stronger than the Asura Demon Tower&rsquo;s seal?&rdquo; the frost woman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the woman in the hut replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;But&hellip; isn&rsquo;t Chu Feng a human? How could he have such terrifying demonic nature?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The frost woman was taken aback. She knew how powerful the Asura Demon Tower&rsquo;s sealing power was, which was why she could hardly fathom how powerful one&rsquo;s demonic nature had to be in order to overpower that seal.</span><br><span>Even thinking about it sent shivers down her spine.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I have set the Asura Demon Tower&rsquo;s sealing power to a level where it&rsquo;s sufficient to suppress the Soul Devouring Demon Exalted. Anyone who overpowers the Soul Devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s demonic nature will be deemed to have cleared the test, and I&rsquo;ll entrust that item to him. I just didn&rsquo;t expect his demonic nature to be this powerful&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>The woman in the hut sounded satisfied with Chu Feng&rsquo;s performance.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It really is shocking,&rdquo; the frost woman remarked.</span><br><span>She turned her attention back to her formation mirror, and unease quickly filled her eyes. The Asura Demon Tower was on the verge of collapse, evident from the powerful asura power and spirit power gushing out from the tower&rsquo;s cracks. Even Eggy, who had been bound in front of the tower, was unable to withstand the power and had fainted.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, are we not going to interfere?&rdquo; the frost woman asked worriedly.</span><br><span>She wasn&rsquo;t worried about Eggy but the consequences arising from the destruction of the Asura Demon Tower.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here. What do you have to worry about?&rdquo; the woman in the hut asked.</span><br><span>The frost woman was first startled by those words before lowering her head in shame.</span><br><span>Indeed, there was nothing for her to worry about when the woman in the hut was here. No matter how powerful those existences in the Asura Demon Tower were, none of them was close to a match for the woman in the hut.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>Loud explosions shook the realm. Even the mountain they were on shook intensely despite being located far away. The Asura Demon Tower had collapsed.</span><br><span>Black gaseous flames gushed into the sky and flooded the realm.</span><br><span>Eighteen gigantic demons emerged one after another. These demons had varying forms, some resembled humans whereas others resembled beasts, but each of them was humongous with terrifying demonic that matched their sizes.</span><br><span>On top of that, they were growing larger with each second. They had been sealed in the Asura Demon Tower for so long that they needed time to recover their original strength and forms.</span><br><span>Grar!</span><br><span>Deafening roars shook the world. The terrifying murderous will behind those roars was so great that they eroded the minds of anyone who heard them. The realm struggled to avoid collapsing before their colossal killing intent. Even those outside the realm could sense their killing intent.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This feeling?&rdquo; Shuang Xue&rsquo;s face paled.</span><br><span>Despite being in another spatial realm, she was still able to sense that terrifying killing intent. She tried to trace the origin of the killing intent, but she quickly realized that it was coming from another realm.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What in the world is going on outside?&rdquo; Shuang Xue was worried.</span><br><span>Her younger sister and the prodigies of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were currently gathered in this Divine Inheritance Ground. If the killing intent was so terrifying that it even leaked into this spatial realm, there was a chance that something bad might have already happened to them.</span><br><span>Meanwhile, Shuang Yu and the others were right beneath the phenomenon, and the proximity allowed them to sense the killing intent much more vividly than Shuang Xue did.</span><br><span>&ldquo;My gosh! What in the world is going on?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Did we anger the gods?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd felt despaired. The killing intent coming from the phenomenon made them feel as if they had been plunged into hell. They didn&rsquo;t know what was going on, but they could sense that the beings who had unleashed the killing intent possessed the power to easily obliterate them from the face of the world.</span><br><span>Only death awaited them if those beings were to manifest in their realm.</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>A cough suddenly echoed in the realm where the eighteen demonic beasts were rampaging.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Cough cough.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Following the coughs, the black gaseous flames quickly receded, revealing the true forms of the eighteen demonic creatures.</span><br><span>The largest of the demonic creatures surprisingly had a humanoid form. He was dressed in black armor, and he carried a gigantic black sword on his back. His facial features were hidden beneath a helmet, but his glowering blood-red eyes commanded fear.</span><br><span>He was shrouded in black gaseous flames that felt much darker than ordinary asura power, almost as if they could devour the entire world whole. He was the Demon Exalted sealed on the eighteenth floor of the Asura Demon Tower, the one who had pitted his demonic nature against Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Soul Devouring Demon Exalted? What brings you here?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The arrogance of the other demonic beasts vanished in an instant, and they lowered their heads subserviently. That was how feared the Soul Devouring Demon Exalted was in the Asura Spirit World, or else these fearless demonic beasts wouldn&rsquo;t have submitted at the sight of him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a relief that Lord Soul Devouring is here too. Lord Soul Devouring, let&rsquo;s show those fools of the vast world of cultivation just how powerful we, Asura World Spirits, are!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The demonic creatures cheered in excitement, convinced that no one would be able to stop their rampage with the Soul Devouring Demon Exalted on their side.</span><br><span>However, the Soul Devouring Demon Exalted paid them no heed and instead looked at the ground beneath him. The other demonic beasts turned their sights over and saw an insignificant little human lying unconscious there.</span><br><span>That person was none other than Chu Feng. He had reverted to his original form right after the Asura Demon Tower had been destroyed.</span><br><span>The Soul Devouring Demon Exalted looked at Chu Feng contemplatively before announcing with a deep voice, &ldquo;Brat, you have piqued my curiosity. I am interested to know where you came from, but my instincts tell me that I can&rsquo;t allow you to live. Don&rsquo;t blame me for this.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Killing intent flared in the eyes of the Soul Devouring Demon Exalted.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>A furious storm that obliterated everything that it touched gushed toward Chu Feng. Not even the realm itself was able to withstand this force, let alone Chu Feng. This was how powerful the Soul Devouring Demon Exalted was.</span><br><span>Yet, the terrifying force abruptly halted in front of Chu Feng as if it had been blocked off by an invisible wall.</span><br><span>The Soul Devouring Demon Exalted was alarmed.</span><br><span>It turned out that a beautiful woman dressed in a white dress had appeared in front of Chu Feng. It was her raised palm that had stopped the furious storm in its tracks.</span><br><span>&ldquo;W-who are you?&rdquo; the other demonic beasts asked.</span><br><span>It was obvious that the beautiful woman was no ordinary person.</span><br><span>The beautiful woman didn&rsquo;t bother answering their question. With a wave of her sleeves, she manifested a metal cage that quickly expanded to unimaginable proportions.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Get in there. Don&rsquo;t make me force you,&rdquo; the beautiful woman ordered.</span><br><span>Those demonic beasts immediately understood the beautiful woman&rsquo;s intention, but how could they allow themselves to be captured once more when they had only just been freed from their imprisonment?</span><br><span>Two of the demonic beasts attempted to escape by transforming into waves of black gaseous flames.</span><br><span>The beautiful woman&rsquo;s eyes turned cold. She flicked her finger, and a massive spatial crack appeared in the sky. Two gigantic black swords descended from the sky and pinned down the two escaping demonic beasts.</span><br><span>Miserable cries ensued.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, please spare me! I wouldn&rsquo;t have dared to escape if I knew that you were here!&rdquo; the Soul Devouring Demon Exalted hurriedly explained with a nervous smile before obediently stepping into the humongous metal cage.</span><br><span>The other demonic beasts were flabbergasted. They wondered who that beautiful woman was to make the Soul Devouring Demon Exalted react in such a manner.</span><br></p></div>
