        <div> - Yin Yang Formation Diagram<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Chu Feng and Chu Lingxi passed through the Yin Yang Gate at pra<br><br>Chu Feng and Chu Lingxi passed through the Yin Yang Gate at practically the same time.<br>At the moment he passed through the Yin Yang Gate, darkness filled Chu Feng&rsquo;s vision. It was as if Chu Feng had entered a formless space of primal chaos.<br>At that moment, he felt the Yin Yang Fate Pearl he held in his hand changing into a stream of heat energy that drilled into his palm.<br>Soon, light appeared before Chu Feng. Chu Lingxi was standing beside him. It was not only Chu Lingxi; Chu Ruoshi and the others were also nearby.<br>When he turned around, Chu Feng was able to see the Yin Yang Gate. However, the surrounding scenery was no longer that of a vast prairie. Instead, they were on a vast mountain.<br>Trees surrounded the mountain. There were also many more mountain peaks in the distance.<br>It was such a beautiful scenery. Not only did it relax one&rsquo;s heart, but one would also feel as if they could become more holy just by being there.<br>There was a formless power there. That power was affecting everyone.<br>Chu Feng and the others knew that they&rsquo;d already entered the Sacred Domain.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng noticed that light was shining from the bodies of Chu Ruoshi and the others nearby. Those lights were shining from one of their hands.<br>At that moment, light also appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. The light on Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was much more dazzling than that of the others.<br>Chu Feng looked to the hand he was holding his Yin Yang Fate Pearl in earlier, and discovered that his Yin Yang Fate Pearl had disappeared. There was only a sun-moon symbol on his palm.<br>It was that symbol that was emitting the light that surrounded Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>Actually, it was not only Chu Feng&rsquo;s body that was emitting such dazzling light. Chu Lingxi, the girl who had partnered up with Chu Feng, was emitting the same sort of dazzling light as him.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s said that the Yin Yang Fate Pearls will unleash different amounts of power according to their level. I wonder if that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said with a beaming smile on her face as she examined the light that covered her body.<br>It could be seen that she was greatly looking forward to what they would experience later.<br>&ldquo;Huuu~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a blue mist appeared from the distant mountain range. That mist was somewhat strange. It seemed like rising blue gaseous flames. Yet, they were moving in a manner akin to a tide.<br>In the blink of an eye, the blue gaseous flames covered several mountains, and were making a beeline for Chu Feng and the others.<br>It resembled a magnificent army with thousands of men and horses unleashing an attack at Chu Feng and the others.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Blueflame Biogas. If we&rsquo;re touched by it, our soul will be burned till nothing is left,&rdquo; Many people started to panic upon seeing the Blueflame Biogas.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to panic about? We possess Flame Extinguishing Pearls,&rdquo; as Chu Ruoshi spoke, she took out her previously-awakened Flame Extinguishing Pearl.<br>The others immediately took out their previously awakened Flame Extinguishing Pearls too.<br>However, even though they were holding their awakened Flame Extinguishing Pearls in their hands, the great majority of the people still had expressions of panic on their faces. They were uncertain as to whether the Flame Extinguishing Pearls would be effective or not.<br>If the Flame Extinguishing Pearls were ineffective, they would end up suffering miserably.<br>At this moment, the Blueflame Biogas reached them. Like a group of tigers and leopards, they pounced toward Chu Feng and the others.<br>Many people started to shiver in fear. However&hellip; the extremely ferocious Blueflame Biogas stopped ten meters away from Chu Feng and the others.<br>Furthermore, one could tell that the Blueflame Biogas was still trying to rush toward them. Seemingly as if Chu Feng and the others were its mortal enemies, it was trying to engulf them completely.<br>However, it seemed that there was an invisible barrier stopping the Blueflame Biogas.<br>Chu Feng decided to leave the crowd and attempt to approach the Blueflame Biogas by himself.<br>He discovered that even after he left the crowd and entered the Blueflame Biogas, the Blueflame Biogas was still keeping a distance of around ten meters from him. It was unable to approach him.<br>&ldquo;Effective! The Flame Extinguishing Pearls are effective! We&rsquo;re safe now! The Blueflame Biogas will not be able to harm us!&rdquo;<br>The crowd understood that Chu Feng was testing his Flame Extinguishing Pearl. As for the outcome of the test, it was very clear. Seeing that the Flame Extinguishing Pearls were effective, the crowd felt much more at ease.<br>&ldquo;However, it seems that the Blueflame Biogas is showing no signs of leaving. With it here, the distance that we can see will be extremely short. It will greatly affect our speed of discovering treasures.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That damned Blueflame Biogas, of all the times it could appear, it decided to appear when the Yin Yang Gate opened.&rdquo;<br>Even though they had managed to escape a calamity through the help of the Flame Extinguishing Pearls, the Blueflame Biogas still served as the greatest problem to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, everyone is extremely anxious about the situation; why do you still have such a calm expression on your face?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you overly resilient, or do you not know how troublesome the situation is?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi blinked her eyes and looked at Chu Feng with a questioning gaze.<br>At that moment, the crowd noticed that even Chu Ruoshi was frowning. Yet, Chu Feng only had a calm and indifferent expression on his face. It was as if he was unrelated to the predicament they were in at that moment.<br>&ldquo;The world of martial cultivators has always been a place where dangers and opportunities are directly proportional to one another.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The more dangerous a situation is, the greater the opportunity it will present. I do not think it is a bad thing for this Blueflame Biogas to cause such trouble for us. It might even be a good thing,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Chu Feng finished saying those words, lights began to appear from the Blueflame Biogas above Chu Feng&rsquo;s head.<br>The lights were extremely strange. The surrounding scenery was completely covered up by the Blueflame Biogas. Yet, the lights were so very clear.<br>The number of lights grew more and more numerous. Like stars, they appeared above Chu Feng and the others.<br>The star-like lights started to criss-cross one another. It was extremely beautiful. Those with discerning eyes were all able to tell that it was a formation.<br>&ldquo;That is&hellip; the Yin Yang Formation Diagram!!!&rdquo; Someone shouted in alarm.<br>&ldquo;Is it really the Yin Yang Formation Diagram?&rdquo; Once that person spoke, many people revealed worried expressions.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistake, that is indeed the Yin Yang Formation Diagram,&rdquo; Chu Ruoshi affirmed the crowd&rsquo;s fears.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; we are truly too unlucky,&rdquo; Upon seeing the Yin Yang Formation Diagram, many people revealed expressions of despair.<br>&ldquo;Sis Lingxi, what is the implication of that Yin Yang Formation Diagram?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to ask Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Contained within the Yin Yang Formation Diagram is the location of the greatest treasure of the Yin Yang Gate. Should one solve the formation, one would be able to discover where that treasure is located,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a good thing? Why is everyone not feeling joyous, but instead mourning?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because after the Yin Yang Formation Diagram appears, all other treasures in the Yin Yang Gate will disappear. Unless one is able to solve the Yin Yang Formation Diagram and find the greatest treasure, everyone will return empty-handed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, this Yin Yang Formation Diagram has appeared multiple times already. However, no one was able to solve it at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because the Yin Yang Formation Diagram is unrelated to world spirit techniques or martial techniques. It is simply an unsolvable puzzle,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng finally realized why everyone was so distressed.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, it would appear that you were wrong this time around. What has accompanied the arrival of the Blueflame Biogas is not a greater opportunity. Instead, it&rsquo;s a greater catastrophe,&rdquo; Chu Ruoshi said.<br>Although she said those words in a very ordinary manner, her tone seemed to contain a trace of mockery.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not necessarily the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled lightly.<br>&ldquo;Not necessarily the case? That Yin Yang Formation Diagram is right above us. With it here, we will not be able to find anything at all. We are destined to return empty-handed,&rdquo; Chu Ruoshi said.<br>&ldquo;However, if we are to solve that Yin Yang Formation Diagram, wouldn&rsquo;t we obtain the greatest treasure here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;All our predecessors were powerless before that Yin Yang Formation Diagram. You think that you&rsquo;re capable of solving it?&rdquo; Chu Ruoshi asked.<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t guarantee success. However, I can give it a try,&rdquo; Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed. It was as if they had seen hope.<br>Even though Chu Feng spoke with reservations, the crowd saw absolute confidence on Chu Feng's face. <br></p></div>
