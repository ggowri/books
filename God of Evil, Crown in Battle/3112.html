        <div> - Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve really gone insane. Furthermore, apart from Exalted Sacred Tiger and Exalted Sacred Deer, there was another person that had also gone insane,&rdquo; Aunt Blackface said.<br>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Exalted Heavenly Fate asked.<br>&ldquo;Murdergod Blue Demon,&rdquo; Aunt Blackface said.<br>&ldquo;Murdergod Blue Demon?&rdquo; Hearing that name, Exalted Heavenly Fate revealed a pensive look. With a low voice, he asked, &ldquo;You discovered them together?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, they were not discovered together. However, they were all discovered in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,&rdquo; Aunt Blackface said.<br>&ldquo;Have you brought them back?&rdquo; Exalted Heavenly Fate asked.<br>&ldquo;This subordinate has already brought them back,&rdquo; Aunt Blackface said.<br>&ldquo;Bring me to them,&rdquo; Exalted Heavenly Fate said.<br>After that, being lead by Aunt Blackface, Exalted Heavenly Fate entered an underground palace.<br>That place was a forbidden area on Heavenly Fate Planet. Apart from Exalted Heavenly Fate, only Aunt Blackface knew the method to enter it.<br>Exalted Heavenly Fate saw his familiar old friends, Exalted Sacred Tiger and Exalted Sacred Deer, in the underground palace. At the same time, he also saw Murdergod Blue Demon.<br>Exalted Heavenly Fate went all-out to help heal the three of them. He wanted to wake them up.<br>After all, apart from being a martial cultivator and a grand prophet, Exalted Heavenly Fate was also a very powerful world spiritist.<br>To him, curing those that had gone insane was simply a trivial matter.<br>However, Exalted Heavenly Fate ended up spending an entire day on their treatment.<br>During that period of time, Aunt Blackface was guarding outside the entire time.<br>Finally, the entrance to the underground palace opened, and Exalted Heavenly Fate walked out from within.<br>&ldquo;Milord, could it be&hellip;&rdquo; Seeing the expression of displeasure on Exalted Heavenly Fate&rsquo;s eyes, Aunt Blackface was surprised. She had realized that his treatment might have failed.<br>Exalted Heavenly Fate sighed. &ldquo;I truly do not know who did it. That person actually managed to put the three of them in such a state.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, the three of them were truly injured by the same person?&rdquo; Aunt Blackface asked.<br>&ldquo;They must&rsquo;ve been attacked by the same person. Merely, I wonder who it is that they&rsquo;d provoked,&rdquo; Exalted Heavenly Fate said.<br>&ldquo;Is there no way to cure them?&rdquo; Aunt Blackface asked.<br>&ldquo;Unless they are to wake up themselves, at least in our Ancestral Martial Starfield, there is no one that will be able to treat them,&rdquo; Exalted Heavenly Fate said.<br>Hearing those words, Aunt Blackface started to frown.<br>If the people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield were not able to cure the three of them, it would likely mean that the person who turned the three of them insane was not someone from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>It would also mean that that individual possessed strength that surpassed that of the people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>&hellip;...<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng had returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan for some time now. However, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, who had stated that he would stay in the Chu Heavenly Clan to guard it, had left.<br>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief finally returned. The first thing he did upon his return was to summon Chu Feng.<br>In the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s palace, Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief were both sitting on the ground.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined such a monster to appear in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief started to frown. He had a pensive look on his face.<br>Chu Feng had informed the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief about what had happened in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.<br>Upon finding out what happened, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief immediately recognized how dangerous that monster was. If such a monster were to appear in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, it would bring about enormous damage.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how about this: this old man will immediately dispatch men to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm to guard it. If something amiss is to happen, they will immediately return to the clan to get reinforcements.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I will definitely not let them disturb your friends and relatives in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you senior,&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed a joyous look on his face upon hearing those words.<br>Although he was worried about those monsters, what Chu Feng was worried about the most would still be his friends and family in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.<br>If the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was willing to dispatch men to protect them, Chu Feng would naturally not have to worry about his friends and relatives so much.<br>Furthermore, this Lord Clan Chief of his was very understanding. He said that he would have their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s experts protect the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm in secret. With this, the people in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm would not feel any pressure.<br>As such, how could Chu Feng not feel joyous, how could he not thank this Lord Clan Chief?<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s merely a trivial matter. There is no need for you to thank me. That said, the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm is not too peaceful right now,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief sighed.<br>&ldquo;What has happened in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that unknown demonic substance. It has been slaughtering innocent people nonstop. Speaking of it, you&rsquo;ve encountered that demonic substance too, no?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking about that little girl?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Mn, according to Xingde and Xingren, they were nearly killed by that demonic substance when they were chasing after it. Fortunately, you were present. It was only because of you that that demonic substance did not kill them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I know that you do not know of that demonic substance, have you ever thought about that demonic substance being related to you?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;Senior, before that day, I had truly never seen that little girl before. I also do not know why she decided to spare us,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind it. This old man will handle this matter. Let&rsquo;s talk about you,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief smiled. Then, he said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, do you know of our Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Cultivation Realm?&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed a confused expression.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you do not know about it. That&rsquo;s normal too,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief smiled lightly.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what is that Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm? What does it have to do with me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;The Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm is a world in the central region of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why it is called the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm is because it does not belong to any power. Instead, it was purely a place for one to train in. If one must speak of ownership, it would belong to the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps it was unrelated to you in the past. However, it is now deeply related to you,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng became even more curious about the so-called Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>However, Chu Feng did not question the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Instead, he quietly and attentively waited for the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to tell him how he was related to the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br></p></div>
