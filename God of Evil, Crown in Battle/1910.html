        <div> - The Means To Become Conceited<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;I am also uncertain as to how to enter the Outer World. However, I feel that whether or not one can enter the Outer World is not related to one&rsquo;s cultivation. Rather, it is related to the Realm of Gods,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;The Realm of Gods?&rdquo; At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze started to flicker slightly. He then said, &ldquo;It would seem that I will have to proceed to the Realm of Gods.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it is better for you to not attempt to go there just yet,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The dangers of that place most certainty surpass your imagination. I know that you are very powerful. However, it is better that you do not go there yet.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When the opportunity presents itself, I will go together with you,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, I will have to trouble Your Majesty,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, there is another matter that you must take note of,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You must be careful of the Dark Hall,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;Dark Hall? Your Majesty, do you know exactly what the Dark Hall is?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I do not know who it is that created the Dark Hall. However, I am certain that the Dark Hall is a very dangerous power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, many of the Holy Land of Martialism&rsquo;s experts have joined their camp. For example, there&rsquo;s the Yin-Yang Immortal,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;Yin-Yang Immortal?&rdquo; Chu Feng had heard of the Yin-Yang Immortal&rsquo;s famous name. However, he did not know much about that Yin-Yang Immortal. All he knew was that the Yin-Yang Immortal was an existence with strength surpassing that of the Snow-haired Immortal and the Compass Immortal.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, you must still remember the Snow-haired Immortal, right?&rdquo; The Elf King asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course. The Snow-haired Immortal is my benefactor,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng is truly a person that remembers graces and kindness shown to you. While it is true that the Snow-haired Immortal helped you, she also harmed you, no? That is what she told me personally. She mentioned to me how she had pushed you into the Extremely Poisonous Sea of Clouds,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that Your Majesty is acquainted with the Snow-haired Immortal?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The Snow-haired Immortal possesses a very reclusive personality. She has very few friends. As for me, I am one of her few friends,&rdquo; The Elf King nodded.<br>&ldquo;Do you know why the Snow-haired Immortal suddenly declared that she would no longer interfere with the grudges between you and the Four Great Imperial Clans during the moment when you were faced with the greatest calamity? It is actually because of the interference of the Yin-Yang Immortal,&rdquo; The Elf King continued.<br>&ldquo;The Yin-Yang Immortal&rsquo;s interference?&rdquo; Chu Feng started to frown. However, he did not express too much surprise. After all, the Dark Hall was secretly helping the Four Great Imperial Clans take care of him. Merely, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know what the relationship between the Yin-Yang Immortal and the Snow-haired Immortal was. Thus, he asked, &ldquo;Could it be that the Yin-Yang Immortal possesses a very close relationship with the Snow-haired Immortal?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be said to be very close. Merely, when the Snow-haired Immortal was younger, she was helped by the Yin-Yang Immortal. Thus, even if she did not wish to help the Yin-Yang Immortal, she had no choice but to do so.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, it was also the Snow-haired Immortal who told me that the Yin-Yang Immortal has joined the Dark Hall. The reason for that was because the Yin-Yang Immortal personally invited the Snow-haired Immortal to join the Dark Hall. However, she refused.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If my guess is correct, the rank six Martial Emperor who appeared at the Ximen Imperial Clan that day should be the Yin-Yang Immortal,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly recalled that the spirit formations that bound Baili Xuankong and the others were extremely powerful. Even he had been unable to rapidly undo them. At that time, Chu Feng knew that there was a powerful Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist helping the Four Great Imperial Clans.<br>Upon hearing what the Elf King said, everything made sense. It turned out that those were the actions of the Yin-Yang Immortal.<br>&ldquo;The Yin-Yang Immortal is only one of them. There are still a lot of other experts in the Holy Land of Martialism. I presume that a lot of them have already joined the Dark Hall.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, I still do not know exactly who has joined the Dark Hall. It is truly us who are in the light while they are in the dark.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However&hellip; as long as the Dark Hall decides to carry out a large scale operation, they will all be exposed. Merely, I&rsquo;m afraid that everyone will be caught off guard at that time,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;The people of the Dark Hall once declared that they would rule over the Holy Land of Martialism. Such a conquest will naturally bring about war. As for wars, they will definitely cause bloodshed. With the style of the Dark Hall, they might even throw the Holy Land of Martialism into a catastrophe,&rdquo; Chu Feng lamented.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng seems to be quite knowledgeable of the Dark Hall. Could it be that you know something else about them?&rdquo; The Elf King asked.<br>&ldquo;The Dark Hall once invited the experts from the World Spiritist Alliance to join them. After they were refused, they dispatched people to exterminate the World Spiritist Alliance. Fortunately, I arrived right on time. Else, the World Spiritist Alliance would likely have suffered a calamity,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, how is the World Spiritist Alliance now?&rdquo; The Elf King asked concernedly.<br>&ldquo;They should be fine,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That would be great. The Dark Hall is going around inviting world spiritists. Most likely, they have some sort of scheme. However, I am also having my men search for the headquarters of the Dark Hall. Since they are a hidden danger, I must eliminate them as soon as possible,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;Your Majesty is planning to wage war against the Dark Hall?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It is as you said. War will bring about bloodshed. As for a war to conquer the Holy Land of Martialism, that holds even more true.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As a person of the Holy Land of Martialism, I feel that we, Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, have a responsibility to prevent this war,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;Your Majesty is a man of righteousness. To be willing to consider the common people of the Holy Land of Martialism, it is most definitely the Holy Land of Martialism&rsquo;s great fortune,&rdquo; At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s impression of the Elf King changed slightly.<br>The rumors he heard earlier all said that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves were very arrogant and conceited. Although that was the truth, the Elf King, at least, was different from the masses.<br>Chu Feng was not trying to flatter the Elf King by saying those words. Rather, he was telling the truth. It was the Holy Land of Martialism&rsquo;s great fortune to have such an Elf King.<br>Chu Feng felt that the capabilities of the Dark Hall were immeasurable. Else, how could they make even an expert like the Yin-Yang Immortal work for them? A power like them most likely possessed strength that was not inferior to the Three Palaces. In fact, they might even be stronger than the Three Palaces.<br>Currently, the only power in the Holy Land of Martialism that could suppress them would be the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng felt that the reason why the Dark Hall still hadn&rsquo;t acted was not because they were afraid of the Three Palaces, the Four Clans, the Nine Powers or the various monstrous beast races. Rather, it was the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves that they feared.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, you are truly overly flattering me. Actually, even I myself do not know for sure whether I will be able to take up the heavy responsibility of protecting the Holy Land of Martialism like senior Qing Xuantian.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, you, on the other hand, will have to shoulder a heavy responsibility,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;What is this heavy responsibility?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;To properly look after my Miaomiao,&rdquo; The Elf King said with a smile.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng also smiled. Then, he clasped his fist in a very serious manner and said, &ldquo;Definitely.&rdquo;<br>Then, Chu Feng returned to the Purple Flames Blackmountain. At the same time, he brought with him two items. They were the two Blood Devouring Armors.<br>As the two Blood Devouring Armors had been altered by the Avaricious Immortal, Chu Feng had to amend them.<br>Furthermore, even though the Blood Devouring Armors were created by the Immeasurable Immortal, Chu Feng still felt them to be imperfect. Thus, he was planning to properly improve upon them and bring them closer to perfection.<br>As for that, it was something that required time. Thus, Chu Feng decided to directly bring the two Blood Devouring Armors back with him. Furthermore, he set an appointment with Xian Miaomiao to meet up at the Blood Devouring Killing Formation&rsquo;s southeastern entrance.<br>After returning to the Purple Flames Blackmountain, Chu Feng discovered that everything was fine. After all, the Compass Immortal was one of the Ten Immortals. With him here, Nangong Longjian would not have any issues.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, your cultivation?&rdquo;<br>However, when Nangong Longjian, the Compass Immortal and the others saw Chu Feng, they were all extremely shocked. The reason for that was because Chu Feng did not attempt to conceal his cultivation. Thus, they were able to discover that Chu Feng had become a Martial Emperor.<br>&ldquo;I happened to make a fortunate breakthrough,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Boy, you are truly a demon-level character. The speed at which you reach breakthroughs is simply godlike,&rdquo; The Compass Immortal exclaimed in admiration repeatedly. Then, he said, &ldquo;It would appear that this old man will not have the chance to take you as a disciple. You&rsquo;re too much of a demon-level character. Even if you want me to become your master, I would not dare to accept you as a disciple.&rdquo;<br>Actually, the Compass Immortal had given up on having Chu Feng become his disciple the moment he found out that Chu Feng had obtained all of the spirit formations contained in the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you are truly flattering me. If you are to continue to say something like that, I will become conceited,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Go ahead and become conceited. You have the means to be conceited,&rdquo; Bai Suyan interrupted.<br>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Even the uncommunicative Nangong Longjian was nodding.<br>Being praised like this, Chu Feng was unable to contain himself, and he started to smile foolishly.<br></p></div>
