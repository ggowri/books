        <h1>Chapter 3351</h1>
        <div> - I, Alone, Will Suffice<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Chu Feng had successfully entered the grand formation, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen beside him did not resemble battle companions. Instead, they seemed like enemies as they were looking at him with eyes filled with hostility.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Lord Clan Chief had treated you so well. Yet you poisoned him. You are truly devoid of conscience, and worse than dogs and pigs. For you to hypocritically pretend to be a good man now, you are simply shameless. I refuse to cooperate with someone like you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We refuse to cooperate with someone like you. Even if we are to give up on this match, we will still not fight alongside someone like you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you want to pretend, go ahead and continue to pretend all on your own. Your daddy I has no time to play with you.&rdquo;<br>Soon, those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations started to speak. They directly began to spout malicious words at Chu Feng.<br>They had all believed and accepted the matter of Chu Feng poisoning their Lord Clan Chief. Thus, they possessed deep hatred for him, and were unwilling to fight with him.<br>Thus, after they finished saying those words, not only did they all begin to leave their respective battle lines, but they even exited the grand formation and returned to the plaza.<br>For the sake of not fighting alongside Chu Feng, they actually gave up on the match.<br>Seeing this scene, Chu Hanqing and his accomplices glanced at Wuming Fenghuo.<br>They seemed to be trying to tell him, &lsquo;Look, didn&rsquo;t I tell you so? That Chu Feng is nothing more than a traitor. Otherwise, how could not even the younger generations be willing to fight alongside him?&rsquo;<br>However, to Chu Hanqing&rsquo;s disappointment, Wuming Fenghuo&rsquo;s eyes were fixed onto the spirit formation, and was completely unconcerned with Chu Feng being abandoned by his fellow clansmen. Instead, he was still watching the match with interest in his eyes.<br>The reason for that was because he simply held no concern for those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations; he simply did not care if they wanted to continue to fight or not. Chu Feng was the only person he was interested in.<br>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen&rsquo;s front, which had originally contained more than ten thousand people, held only thirteen individuals.<br>Besides Chu Feng, there were twelve other Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>Those people dared to stand beside Chu Feng at such a time and receive the cold gazes of their entire clan, and were even willing to bare the title of being traitors to the clan.<br>Thus, those twelve people were not only people that trusted Chu Feng, but they were also very courageous.<br>Among those twelve were people that Chu Feng recognized.<br>There was Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu and Chu Shuangshuang. There was one person among them that was quite a surprise to Chu Feng. That person&hellip; was the person who had betrayed Chu Feng for her own self-interest in the past, Chu Yue.<br>However, it seemed like she had gone through a massive transformation. Her determined expression and the confidence in her eyes illustrated that she was prepared to stand beside Chu Feng, even if she were to confront their entire clan.<br>Chu Feng did not know the remaining seven people. However, at that moment, he remembered their faces. They were all people that chose to believe him during the most difficult time, people that were willing to stand by him and face the cold eyes of their entire clan.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. Earlier, even with over ten thousand people, your Chu Heavenly Clan was still unable to stop us. And now, with only the thirteen of you, do you all still insist on stopping us?&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a clansman of the Fang Heavenly Clan spoke.<br>Once he spoke, all of the Fang Heavenly Clansmen burst into loud laughter, and began to assail Chu Feng and the others with insults.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly pulled out the banner that was stuck in the ground.<br>Holding their clan&rsquo;s banner over his shoulder, he walked over to the Fang Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s army.<br>Seeing this, some people&rsquo;s expressions started to change.<br>They began to ponder in their hearts, &lsquo;For that Chu Feng to not guard their final camp and instead step forward with the banner, could he be planning to surrender?&rsquo;<br>At the moment when they were all pondering what Chu Feng was planning to do, he had arrived before the army of Fang Heavenly Clansmen. His gaze was burning; he simply did not resemble someone who was planning to surrender.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng turned around and looked to Chu Qing and the others behind him, &ldquo;Thank you all for being willing to stand with me today. However, you all need not involve yourselves with this battle today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; this guy, what is he trying to say?&rdquo;<br>The Fang Heavenly Clansmen were all confused by Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. They were unable to understand what he was trying to say.<br>However, before they could react, Chu Feng turned his gaze toward them. With a stern voice, he said, &ldquo;For handling you all, I, Chu Feng alone, will suffice.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, the people from the Fang Heavenly Clan, the powers invited by the Fang Heavenly Clan, and even the Starfield Master Realm and the Chu Heavenly Clan were all startled.<br>No matter how powerful Chu Feng might be, the Fang Heavenly Clan had Fang Hualong. How could Chu Feng possibly make such a boastful claim?<br>Suddenly, a Fang Heavenly Clansman started to laugh loudly. &ldquo;Hahaha. While I do not know if that Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son has truly poisoned the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s clan chief or not, I am, however, impressed by his ability to boast.&rdquo;<br>Then, the people from the Zhao Heavenly Clan, the Song Heavenly Clan, Signal Fire Gate City, the Cyan Sword Sect and the other powers all began to laugh loudly.<br>They were immersed in their joyous laughter. It was as if they&rsquo;d heard an enormous joke.<br>Even the Starfield Master Realm&rsquo;s Wuming Gangxiong revealed a ridiculing smile.<br>They all felt that Chu Feng was nothing more than a joke.<br>Even if he was Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, they still did not place him in their eyes at all.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s clothes moved. Then, a strong burst of wind was released from his body.<br>In an instant, the two thousand-plus elites of the Fang Heavenly Clan were all blown to the sky like loose leaves encountering a tornado.<br>In merely an instant, they were all sent flying several tens of thousands of meters away. When they landed, they were all howling in pain. They had all lost their ability to continue fighting.<br>The Fang Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elites, that group that had defeated over ten thousand of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, was instantly defeated by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! That Chu Feng, he&hellip;!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the people present, including the Starfield Master Realm, the Fang Heavenly Clan and even the Chu Heavenly Clan, were all astonished.<br>This was especially true for the Fang Heavenly Clansmen. The ridiculing smiles on their faces disappeared, and were replaced with endless nervousness and unease.<br>They were so nervous that they actually stood up from their distinguished guest seats.<br>The reason for that was because of the aura that Chu Feng was emitting.<br>His aura was actually that of a rank seven Martial Immortal!!!<br></p></div>
