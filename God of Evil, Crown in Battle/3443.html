        <div> - That Bad<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed a look of surprise.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. She explicitly stated that she wanted to thank you for helping her become a Snake Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist. However, she also wanted to invite everyone else to get together. That&rsquo;s how this gathering of the younger generations came about,&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie said.<br>&ldquo;Then she must&rsquo;ve invited you too, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie nodded her head.<br>&ldquo;Do you want to go?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Wuma Shengjie didn&rsquo;t answer. Instead, she asked, &ldquo;Do you want to go?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really interested,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that it wouldn&rsquo;t do for you to not go.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, Wuming Xingyun was also invited to go. That big sister of yours was also brought over by Wuming Xingyun,&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s such a thing?&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed a helpless expression upon learning that. Then, he said, &ldquo;It would appear that I will have to go to the Tantai Heavenly Clan then.&rdquo;<br>Soon, Chu Feng arrived at the Ice Summit. Although the Ice Summit&rsquo;s grand formation had been breached, the isolated space was still present.<br>Furthermore, Grandmaster Liangqiu had Liangqiu Chengfeng bestow everyone a title plate. With that, the people of the younger generation would be able to enter the spirit formation space left behind by the World Spiritist Immortal King on the peak of the Ice Summit at will.<br>After Chu Feng and the others entered the spirit formation space, they immediately saw Liangqiu Chengfeng.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng,&rdquo; Liangqiu Chengfeng was extremely excited to see Chu Feng. He carefully inspected Chu Feng before asking, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, where did you go off to?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, I am truly sorry. I lost control earlier,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Lost control?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Liangqiu Chengfeng began to look at Chu Feng with a worried expression. He realized that things&hellip; did not seem to be simple.<br>Chu Feng then began to give an account of what had happened to Liangqiu Chengfeng.<br>&ldquo;I had expected that young friend Chu Feng would have received a backlash. However, I didn&rsquo;t expect your backlash to be so severe. Not only was your cultivation sealed, but even your world spirit techniques were sealed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come, let me have a look at you,&rdquo; As Liangqiu Chengfeng spoke, he grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm and began to instill his spirit power into Chu Feng to diagnose his situation.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; However, after the examination, Liangqiu Chengfeng&rsquo;s expression became ugly.<br>&ldquo;Senior, how is it? Is it possible to remove the seal?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Not to mention removing the seal, I simply cannot detect the seal at all,&rdquo; Liangqiu Chengfeng said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Ah? Unable to detect it? But&hellip; my cultivation is clearly sealed,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Wuma Shengjie also revealed looks of nervousness. The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief even asked, &ldquo;Milord, what are we to do? Is Chu Feng&rsquo;s backlash really that serious?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Judging from the situation at hand, Chu Feng&rsquo;s backlash is indeed very thorny. However, do not worry, as my master is still here. We can let him have a look. However, he is currently resting. I will go and inform him of the situation&rdquo;<br>After Liangqiu Chengfeng finished saying those words, he immediately left. Soon, Liangqiu Chengfeng returned, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, follow me.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, both Wuma Shengjie and the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief understood his intention.<br>Chu Feng could follow him to see Grandmaster Liangqiu, but they were not allowed to follow him.<br>Thus, after Chu Feng left with Liangqiu Chengfeng, Wuma Shengjie and the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief both stayed where they were.<br>Following Liangqiu Chengfeng, Chu Feng arrived before a small palace.<br>The small palace appeared to be very simple and plain. It was not dazzling with gold and decorations. However&hellip; there was no entrance.<br>Upon seeing the small palace, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression became complicated. Even though his spirit power was sealed, it remained that he had trained in world spirit techniques for many years. Thus, he was able to tell that it was not an ordinary palace, but rather a spirit formation, a healing formation and&hellip; a very powerful healing formation on top of that.<br>&ldquo;Senior, could it be that Grandmaster Liangqiu&hellip;?&rdquo; Chu Feng looked at Liangqiu Chengfeng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. Master wants you to go in, so go on in,&rdquo; Liangqiu Chengfeng smiled. Then he waved his sleeve, and a gate appeared on the entrance-less palace.<br>Chu Feng did not hesitate, and directly walked through the gate.<br>After entering the palace, the surroundings changed enormously. There was simply no structure resembling the inside of a palace. Instead, it was roaming with boundless Saint-level spirit power. Sure enough, it was a healing formation.<br>Sitting cross-legged in the middle of the healing formation was a person. Seeing the back of that person, Chu Feng knew that it was Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, you&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu turned around and let out a faint laugh.<br>However, his laughter was very hoarse and weak.<br>Seeing the current Grandmaster Liangqiu, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed enormously.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu was completely emaciated. He did not resemble a living person at all. Instead, he resembled a dried up corpse that had crawled out from its coffin.<br>Chu Feng had guessed that something might&rsquo;ve happened to Grandmaster Liangqiu that caused him to need to use such a healing formation.<br>However, Chu Feng had not expected Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s situation to be that bad.<br></p></div>
