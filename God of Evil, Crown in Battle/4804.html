        <h1>Chapter 4803</h1>
        <div>: Frustrated<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What? Has to be a man?&rdquo;<br>Both Li Muzhi and Xia Yan rolled their eyes upon hearing those words. They were still wondering what kind of special condition it would be, but it turned out to be just this.<br>Wasn&rsquo;t it obvious that one had to be a man in order to participate in the matchmaking convention? There were no women who registered in the first place.<br>&ldquo;Lord Hidden Dragon Elder, what&rsquo;s the fourth condition?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple,&rdquo; Li Muzhi&rsquo;s grandfather said.<br>&ldquo;Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple? Grandfather, does that mean that one has to reach the top of the Hidden Dragon Disciples?&rdquo; Li Muzhi asked.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that obvious?&rdquo;<br>Li Muzhi&rsquo;s grandfather rolled his eyes before turning to look at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I believe you should have heard rumors about the current Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple. He has also registered for the fight for Zi Ling as well. Tomorrow, you, Zuoqiu Youyu, and all of the registered disciples will be able to issue a challenge against the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple. Anyone who obtained the title will be betrothed to Zi Ling,&rdquo; Li Muzhi said.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s face immediately darkened. He never thought that the mysterious Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple would get involved in this matter too.<br>&ldquo;Grandfather, what&rsquo;s the cultivation level of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple?&rdquo; Li Muzhi asked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;ll only find out tomorrow,&rdquo; Li Muzhi&rsquo;s grandfather replied.<br>&ldquo;If no one challenges him, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that Zi Ling would be betrothed to him?&rdquo; Li Muzhi asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Li Muzhi&rsquo;s grandfather said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll surely issue a challenge if I were you. There&rsquo;s no way I would allow Junior Zi Ling fall into the hands of another man. Junior Zi Ling is the number one beauty of our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect! Xia Yan is pretty too, but she pales in comparison to Junior Zi Ling,&rdquo; Li Muzhi said.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you? It&rsquo;s one thing for you to compliment Junior Zi Ling, but do you have to put me down while you&rsquo;re at it?&rdquo;<br>The infuriated Xia Yan threw a punch right at Li Muzhi&rsquo;s face. She used a considerable amount of force, bruising his face up right away.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just speaking the truth! Do you have to get so violent? Lord Xia, look at how vicious your granddaughter is! You should keep her in line,&rdquo; Li Muzhi turned to Xia Yan&rsquo;s grandfather and cried out.<br>However, Li Muzhi&rsquo;s grandfather had already spoken up before Xia Yan&rsquo;s grandfather could say a word, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to keep her in line. The mouth of this grandson of mine is simply too nasty. I&rsquo;d say that it&rsquo;s a well-deserved punch.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that there was no one to back him up, Li Muzhi could only accept his fate.<br>Despite having received a punch, he was still in a good mood. Zuoqiu Yanliang was finally gone, and Zuoqiu Youyu had also been humiliated.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart felt incredibly heavy. Despite his breakthrough, he was only at rank one Martial Exalted level at the moment. Putting aside the unfathomable Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple, even Zuoqiu Youyu would be a huge headache to him.<br>The odds were not in his favor, but he couldn&rsquo;t back down now. He wouldn&rsquo;t be able to bear seeing Zi Ling getting betrothed to another man.<br>&ldquo;Lord Hidden Dragon Elder, can you do me a favor?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked at Xia Yan&rsquo;s grandfather with pleading eyes.<br>&ldquo;Feel free to speak,&rdquo; Xia Yan&rsquo;s grandfather replied.<br>He hadn&rsquo;t had much contact with Chu Feng so far, but he had a high opinion of the latter. He was willing to help Chu Feng as long as he didn&rsquo;t ask for too much.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to use the sect&rsquo;s supporting formations.&rdquo;<br>Right now, he could only count on the supporting formations to raise his cultivation. He had succeeded once with the supporting formation in Li Muzhi&rsquo;s residence, proving that it was a feasible course of action.<br>While he later failed with the supporting formation in the North Tortoise Hall, he felt that the ones in the South Vermilion Hall and West Tiger Hall should be of help to him.<br>&ldquo;You wish to use our supporting formation? That isn&rsquo;t a problem at all. Leave it to me,&rdquo; Xia Yan&rsquo;s grandfather accepted the request decisively.<br>Chu Feng was quickly led to the supporting formation. Under the support of the two Hidden Dragon Elders, he was able to use both the West Tiger Hall and South Vermilion Hall without a hitch.<br>Unfortunately, even as he boosted his intelligence through the powers of the two supporting formations, he was still unable to further unlock the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor.<br>His last hope was the supporting formation in the sectmaster&rsquo;s residence.<br>It was just that the two Hidden Dragon Elders couldn&rsquo;t help him with that. That supporting formation was the sectmaster&rsquo;s private possession, so the only way to use it was to gain the sectmaster&rsquo;s permission.<br>Left with no choice, Chu Feng could only return to his formation for the time being.<br>It would be a tough fight tomorrow, but he couldn&rsquo;t afford to back down here.<br>With all his means, he could raise his cultivation to rank four Martial Exalted level. It still wasn&rsquo;t sufficient for him to defeat Zuoqiu Youyu, but if he were to employ the<br>, he might still stand a chance here.<br>Of course, Zuoqiu Youyu was no pushover either, so there was still a big chance that things wouldn&rsquo;t work out.<br>Not to mention, the greater problem here was the enigmatic Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple. If the latter was at Zuoqiu Youyu&rsquo;s level, he might still stand a chance. Otherwise, his hands would be tied.<br>He felt like his heart would die if he had to watch Zi Ling marry another man.<br>&ldquo;Why am I so weak?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng really wanted to slap himself for his uselessness.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, why do you look so frustrated?&rdquo;<br>A person suddenly appeared by his side. It was Duan Liufeng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Duan, you haven&rsquo;t left yet?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was overjoyed to see Duan Liufeng.<br>&ldquo;The sectmaster decided to first decide on Zi Ling&rsquo;s marriage before setting off. Are you worried about the marriage convention tomorrow?&rdquo; Duan Liufeng asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes. To be honest, Zi Ling and I are&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to say anything more. Come with me.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng suddenly felt space flowing swiftly past him. Before he knew it, he was already gliding through the air, moving at a speed so fast that he couldn&rsquo;t make out the scenery around him.<br>When everything finally came to a halt, he found that he was standing above the ocean. Right in front of him was a powerful supporting formation.<br>This was the first time Chu Feng was seeing this supporting formation, but it was indubitably stronger than the ones he had seen in the other four halls.<br>Without a doubt, he was standing right before the supporting formation in the sectmaster&rsquo;s residence.<br></p></div>
