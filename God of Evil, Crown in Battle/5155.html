        <h1>Chapter 5154</h1>
        <div>: Brother, You&rsquo;re Robbing Me?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>Old Cat had a complicated expression on its face.<br>&ldquo;What about me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with narrowed eyes.<br>&ldquo;You look like a person I know, &ldquo; Old Cat blurted out.<br>Pft!<br>Chu Feng burst into laughter.<br>&ldquo;Are you sure that I only look like him?&rdquo; he asked.<br>&ldquo;Y-you can&rsquo;t really be Chu Feng, right? Impossible! How could a brat from that trashy realm possibly be here, competing with me over Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s legacy?&rdquo;<br>Old Cat was unwilling to believe the truth.<br>To him, it was like a beggar from an impoverished realm whom he looked down on from the bottom of his heart had somehow overtaken him in the short span of a few years. This was a situation he could neither comprehend nor accept.<br>&ldquo;Old Cat, are you feigning ignorance now? Tell me, where is Xue Ji?&rdquo; Chu Feng reined in his smile and questioned.<br>&ldquo;Y-you really are Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>With all that had been said, Old Cat had no choice but to confront the truth. The person before him had to be Chu Feng. There was no other way he could have known about Xue Ji.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, he&rsquo;s that cat who kidnapped my young miss?&rdquo; Yu Sha asked in agitation.<br>Xue Ji was Yu Sha&rsquo;s young miss. She had only contracted with Chu Feng in order to find Xue Ji, but she later discovered that Xue Ji had been kidnapped by someone else. She tried to return to the Asura Spirit World right after, but it was impossible due to the peculiar nature of Chu Feng&rsquo;s World Spirit Space. Left with no choice, she could only follow Chu Feng around.<br>While this was her greatest hope of finding Xue Ji, she knew that the chances were slim due to how large the world of cultivation was. Who could have known that they would actually chance upon the cat who kidnapped her young miss?<br>&ldquo;Yu Sha, this is indeed the cat who kidnapped your young miss. I know that you want to teach him a lesson, but there&rsquo;s no rush. I&rsquo;ll give you an opportunity to do so later,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Yu Sha&rsquo;s face darkened. She glared at Old Cat with vicious eyes.<br>Old Cat didn&rsquo;t know that it had caught Yu Sha&rsquo;s eyes. It was still recovering from the shock of meeting Chu Feng here in Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s ancient remnant.<br>&ldquo;This shouldn&rsquo;t be possible. It has only been a few years. There&rsquo;s no way anyone could possibly grow that quickly!&rdquo; Old Cat exclaimed in disbelief.<br>&ldquo;Answer my question. Where is Xue Ji?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes slowly turned cold as he clenched his fists. The poop assault formation started to tightly squeeze Old Cat, causing the latter&rsquo;s face to scrunch in pain. Despite so, Old Cat wasn&rsquo;t saying a word at all.<br>Weng!<br>A spirit formation gate suddenly opened, and Yu Sha walked out.<br>Paying no heed to the poop formation, Yu Sha walked up to Old Cat and started hitting and kicking its face.<br>&ldquo;W-who are you? How dare a measly world spirit like you lay your hands on me?&rdquo;<br>Old Cat showed a scornful expression even though he was being beaten up. Yu Sha was simply too weak to inflict any significant damage on Old Cat.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your life for kidnapping my young miss!&rdquo;<br>Yu Sha drew her sword to hack at Old Cat, but she was still unable to hurt the latter at all.<br>&ldquo;Young miss? Who&rsquo;s your young miss? Xue Ji?&rdquo;<br>Old Cat finally understood what was going on.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Her young miss is Xue Ji. She contracted with me in order to find Xue Ji, only to learn that you have kidnapped her. You ought to suffer her wrath for what you have done.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng manifested a formation sword using the ancient remnant&rsquo;s energy. He had embedded an offensive formation into it, further enhancing its prowess.<br>&ldquo;Yu Sha, you won&rsquo;t be able to hurt him with your current formation. Use this instead,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he tossed the formation sword to Yu Sha.<br>Yu Sha received the formation sword and unhesitatingly stabbed it into Old Cat&rsquo;s left shoulder.<br>Old Cat was ultimately just a cat, so its physique was small. The sword was only aimed at its left shoulder, but the width of the sword nearly lopped off its entire arm.<br>&ldquo;Stop, I&rsquo;ll talk! Xue Ji is doing well! She&rsquo;s doing well!&rdquo;<br>Old Cat hurriedly surrendered amidst hisses of pain.<br>Despite this, Yu Sha didn&rsquo;t stop her attacks at all. She inflicted a few more bloodied gorges on Old Cat&rsquo;s body.<br>&ldquo;Ahh! You&rsquo;re so vicious for a woman! I&rsquo;ve already told you what I know, but why are you still doing this to me?&rdquo;<br>Old Cat felt so indignant that it started tearing up, but that wasn&rsquo;t enough to placate Yu Sha.<br>&ldquo;Alright, Yu Sha. You should stop for now.&rdquo;<br>It was at Chu Feng&rsquo;s words that Yu Sha finally put down the formation sword. Despite her burning rage, she still heeded Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;Old Cat, is Xue Ji really fine?&rsquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;She really is fine! She&rsquo;s living the life right now. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, I can bring you to her! Stop hitting me, alright? Look at this scrawny body of mine. I can&rsquo;t take beatings!&rdquo; Old Cat cried out.<br>Chu Feng felt like he had finally been released from a boulder that had been weighing on his heart for the longest time.<br>&ldquo;Old Cat, do you still remember what else you have taken from me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Are you talking about the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip? I have already sold it. There&rsquo;s no point keeping something I can&rsquo;t fuse with,&rdquo; Old Cat replied.<br>&ldquo;Trying to deceive me again?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.<br>With a wave of his hand, three Cosmos Sacks hidden on Old Cat&rsquo;s body flew into Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands. However, these Cosmos Sacks had protective formations cast on them.<br>&ldquo;Open them.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng tossed the Cosmos Sacks back to Old Cat.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, are you robbing me now? Surely that&rsquo;s beneath someone of your stature?&rdquo; Old Cat protested in reluctance.<br>&ldquo;Are you going to do it or not?&rdquo; Yu Sha asked as she raised the formation sword once more.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;<br>Old Cat immediately caved in. After having suffered in Yu Sha&rsquo;s hands, it was much more obedient to her than Chu Feng. It quickly released the protective formations on the Cosmos Sacks.<br>There were a fair amount of treasures in them, but there was not a single one that was good enough to light up Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes. Needless to say, the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip wasn&rsquo;t in there either.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that these are the only things you have,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;This is really all I have. Brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re only saying that because you don&rsquo;t know me well. I am actually a habitual gambler. I admit that I do go around taking good stuff from others, but most of that is eventually lost on the betting table,&rdquo; Old Cat replied.<br>&ldquo;You were able to conceal yourself and siphon the energy at the entrance of the ancient remnant. That must have been done with the help of a treasure. Take the treasure out,&rdquo; Chu Feng ordered.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I won&rsquo;t lie to you. That&rsquo;s indeed a treasure, but it&rsquo;s too deeply fused into my soul for me to take it out. Even if you kill me, the treasure will simply dissipate with my soul. You won&rsquo;t be able to obtain it either way,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>Naturally, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t buy it.<br>He activated the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk, which swiftly understood his intention and guided him into Old Cat&rsquo;s soul. Surprisingly, Old Cat wasn&rsquo;t lying. The treasure was indeed in its soul.<br>Following that, Chu Feng released his spirit power and tried sensing Old Cat&rsquo;s soul directly, but he was unable to find the treasure that way. This showed that the treasure was deeply fused into Old Cat&rsquo;s soul. It wouldn&rsquo;t be easy for him to acquire the treasure.<br></p></div>
