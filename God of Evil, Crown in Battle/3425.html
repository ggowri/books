        <div> - Receiving A Backlash<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, someone cried out in alarm. &ldquo;Look, that Nine Dragons Saint Cloak is assimilating with Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>The Nine Dragons Saint Cloak should be worn on one&rsquo;s body.<br>However, when the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak approached Chu Feng, it did not sit on his body like it was supposed to. Instead, like a spiritual item, it entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s body and began to assimilate with him.<br>&ldquo;Why would this be happening? Grandmaster, what is going on?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why is the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak assimilating with Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen questioned Grandmaster Liangqiu with unreconciled expressions.<br>&ldquo;Why is the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak assimilating with Chu Feng? Is there even a need to ask such a question?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that you all have never heard of &lsquo;the person who breaches the formation shall receive the Saint Cloak?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And you all were thinking about breaching this formation before?&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu had a cold expression on his face.<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen turned ashen.<br>Indeed, the person who breached the formation would receive the Saint Cloak.<br>And now, Chu Feng had obtained the Saint Cloak. What did it signify?<br>Chu Feng was the core to breaching the formation this time around!!!<br>It was not Linghu Hongfei.<br>&ldquo;This guy, he&rsquo;s actually the one who breached the grand formation?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, it was not only the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations that were astonished. Tang Zhenghao was also looking at Chu Feng with a complicated expression.<br>After all, he was someone who had defeated Chu Feng before.<br>However, Chu Feng had become the most dazzling person present. Yet he&hellip; could only remain an unknown observer.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak suddenly started to emit a dazzling white light. Chu Feng also started to emit white light from his body.<br>One could not see Chu Feng&rsquo;s face, as it was covered in light. One could only see that he was currently wearing a cloak.<br>Not only was that cloak twinkling with light, but there were also nine dragons present on the cloak. Flowing through the nine dragons were spirit power.<br>That was&hellip; Saint-level spirit power!!!<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually Saint-level spirit power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master, could it be that Chu Feng has&hellip; already become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>Liangqiu Hongyue looked at Grandmaster Liangqiu with an astonished expression.<br>It was not only her. Liangqiu Lanyue, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er, Linghu Yueyue and Wuma Shengjie all felt extremely astonished.<br>They all knew that Chu Feng had most definitely made a breakthrough in his world spirit techniques. They just didn&rsquo;t expect Chu Feng to make a breakthrough past Dragon Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist and become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist in a single stroke.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that young friend Chu Feng has indeed become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he actually really became a Saint-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The prophecy has been realized. Exalted Heavenly Fate&rsquo;s prophecy has been realized.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist in the history of our Ancestral Martial Starfield really did emerge on the Ice Summit.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, it was not only the people of the younger generation that were astonished. Those from the older generation also felt extremely excited.<br>In the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, there were very few Saint-cloak World Spiritists.<br>As for a Saint-cloak World Spiritist as young as Chu Feng, there were simply none besides him.<br>To the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, this was something of extraordinary significance.<br>That said, compared to Grandmaster Liangqiu and the other grand characters, the people from the younger generation were even more astonished.<br>They all thought that Linghu Hongfei would be the one to become the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>However, reality had revealed to them that the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist was actually Chu Feng.<br>Most importantly, Chu Feng had two other identities.<br>Firstly, he was Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son.<br>Next, he was very possibly the prophesied child that was destined to have a battle against Linghu Hongfei.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Hongfei, did you&hellip;&rdquo; Right at that moment, Linghu Yueyue looked at Linghu Hongfei. with grief filled eyes.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei understood Linghu Yueyue&rsquo;s grief-filled gaze. He smiled and stroked her head. Then, he walked over to Chu Feng and clasped his fist. &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, congratulations.&rdquo;<br>Hearing Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s words, many people of the younger generation nodded in approval.<br>&ldquo;Linghu Hongfei is truly worthy of being our Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s strongest person of the younger generation. His elegant demeanor is something rarely possessed.&rdquo;<br>Even though Linghu Hongfei had failed to become the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist, and also failed to obtain the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak&rsquo;s acknowledgement, praises for Linghu Hongfei were still sounding nonstop from the crowd.<br>Linghu Hongfei was still Linghu Hongfei.<br>Even though he had failed to obtain honor, he was still the brightest and most eye-catching person wherever he went.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Linghu Tiemian let out a cry of pain.<br>Although Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s injury was not cured by Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s treatment, he had managed to fall asleep.<br>Thus, his sudden cry of pain caught the crowd&rsquo;s attention.<br>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; After observing Linghu Tiemian, Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>Seeing that, Linghu Hongfei hurriedly asked, &ldquo;Grandmaster, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is not caused by the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak&rsquo;s injury. Instead, there&rsquo;s something wrong with his soul. There&rsquo;s a berserk power within his soul,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu said.<br>&ldquo;A berserk power? Why would there be a berserk power within his body?&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei and the others were all confused.<br>However, right at that moment, Linghu Mingye, Linghu Lun, Mengyan Wushuang and Tongtian Yuanming, as well as the other two younger generations from the Tantai Heavenly Clan, all fell to the ground and started screaming in pain.<br>They were all people of the younger generation that had entered the grand formation.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the black flames! Grandmaster, this should be a backlash caused by the black flames,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei said.<br>&ldquo;Black flames? But their assimilation with the black flames wasn&rsquo;t deep. Why would they receive such a backlash?&rdquo; Linghu Yueyue asked.<br>&ldquo;Wuuu~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after her words left her mouth, she too revealed a look of pain.<br>Following that, the Liangqiu Sisters, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er and Wuma Shengjie also revealed looks of pain.<br>Merely, compared to Linghu Tiemian and the others, the five of them had a much lesser degree of pain.<br>At that moment, Tang Zhenghao and the other members of the younger generation, as well as Grandmaster Liangqiu and the other older generations, all turned their eyes to Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the greater the degree one assimilates with that power, the lesser of a backlash one will receive. The reverse also holds true.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, young friend Chu Feng and young friend Linghu wouldn&rsquo;t be completely fine,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu said.<br></p></div>
