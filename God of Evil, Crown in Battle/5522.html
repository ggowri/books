        <h1>Chapter 5522: Undefeatable</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;Shut up! What rights do you have to criticize our young master?&rdquo; the Totem Phoenix Clansmen roared back.</span><br><span>Despite their rage, they still occasionally glanced at Chu Feng with fearful eyes. They had refuted the Totem Dragon Clansmen&rsquo;s words because they couldn&rsquo;t stand watching their young master getting humiliated, but they also thought that Chu Feng was simply too frightening.</span><br><span>They thought that Chu Feng&rsquo;s feat was even more formidable than Long Chengyu&rsquo;s, considering how he was able to defeat Feng Tiansheng so quickly.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ahahaha!&rdquo; Feng Tiansheng suddenly burst into laughter. He wiped the blood off his </span><span>lips as he said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re indeed a capable individual. You&rsquo;re even stronger than Long Chengyu. You&rsquo;re qualified to see the real me.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Feng Tiansheng&rsquo;s forehead mark suddenly disappeared, as if it had seeped into his head. His eyes turned incredibly bright as waves of golden aura rippled from him. Even his halberd turned golden.</span><br><span>The crowd could feel that he had become much stronger than before, to the point that he didn&rsquo;t feel like the same person as before.</span><br><span>However, Chu Feng narrowed his eyes.</span><br><span>He knew Feng Tiansheng had ignited his bloodline. While it temporarily granted him a huge surge in his fighting prowess, he would suffer from a horrible backlash later on.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Feng Tiansheng, it&rsquo;s just a spar. You don&rsquo;t have to go that far,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I have to win this battle,&rdquo; Feng Tiansheng said as he swung his halberd downward.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>It was such a powerful strike that it shattered even space. An incomparably huge halberd silhouette spanning a width of over a thousand meters flew down on Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Not daring to take this attack lightly, Chu Feng immediately took evasive measures.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>Before the halberd silhouette could even get to Chu Feng, it suddenly exploded, bringing devastation to a huge area around it. If not for Chu Feng&rsquo;s timely escape, he would have been caught in the explosion too.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>Another explosion echoed as the halberd rushed out of the explosion and charged at where Chu Feng had escaped to.</span><br><span>Chu Feng performed another evasive maneuver while simultaneously unleashing a burst of sword qi on Feng Tiansheng.</span><br><span>Much to his surprise, Feng Tiansheng didn&rsquo;t bother dodging at all. Instead, he flung his halberd to block Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack. Same as before, Chu Feng had hidden a martial skill inside the sword qi, but it wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to overpower the halberd&rsquo;s momentum.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with his means? How is he able to continuously use it?&rdquo; Eggy was confused.</span><br><span>There was a limit to the usage of Exalted Taboo Martial Skills. No matter how powerful Feng Tiansheng was, he shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to consecutively use it without any rest in between.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It could be that his bloodline complements that martial skill well, allowing him to bypass usual restrictions. Don&rsquo;t worry, he still isn&rsquo;t a match for me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Admit defeat, Chu Feng. I don&rsquo;t want to kill you,&rdquo; Feng Tiansheng shouted.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t able to stay in that state for too long, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>Feng Tiansheng&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up.</span><br><span>Indeed, he was unable to maintain this state for long. Knowing that there was no time to lose, he swung his halberd and continued his attacks. Multiple halberd silhouettes simultaneously rushed at Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Should those halberd silhouettes explode at the same time, the sheer area of the </span><span>explosion would be so great that not even Chu Feng would be able to avoid it. However, Chu Feng was no ordinary cultivator.</span><br><span>With a single step, he suddenly vanished into thin air.</span><br><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s disappearance alarmed Feng Tiansheng.</span><br><span>Dang!</span><br><span>All of a sudden, Feng Tiansheng heard a loud buzz behind him. He hurriedly turned around, only to see Chu Feng standing behind him with the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword slashing down on his arm.</span><br><span>However, the slash was blocked by the golden aura shrouding Feng Tiansheng&rsquo;s body.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That golden aura protects him too?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured in shock as he quickly flitted away.</span><br><span>His cultivation was currently at rank six Half-God level, and Divine Flitting allowed him to travel at a speed four cultivation ranks faster than his current limit. In other words, he could move at speeds unmatched by any Half-God level cultivators.</span><br><span>That should have allowed him to easily curb enemies of the same cultivation rank, but it looked like he had underestimated Feng Tiansheng.</span><br><span>Feng Tiansheng&rsquo;s means combined offense with defense. Chu Feng&rsquo;s simple slash was nowhere near enough to breach his defense.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Chu Feng. I have to win this battle,&rdquo; Feng Tiansheng surprisingly apologized to Chu Feng after blocking his attack.</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>Feng Tiansheng&rsquo;s body released an intense burst of light, and Chu Feng immediately sensed a lethal threat.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That fellow!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng hurriedly employed Divine Flitting and retreated. A split instant after he ran away, Feng Tiansheng&rsquo;s surrounding was enveloped by the intense light, releasing a force that was comparable to his halberd swings.</span><br><span>It was fortunate that Chu Feng had retreated on time. The consequences would have been dire if he was caught in the attack.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why is Feng Tiansheng that strong?&rdquo; Long Shanshan and the others were worried.</span><br><span>They couldn&rsquo;t see Chu Feng at all; all they saw were the terrifying martial power shockwaves coming from the exploding halberd silhouettes. As cultivators, they could tell how devastating the impact of the attacks was.</span><br><span>Even Long Chengyu would have struggled against Feng Tiansheng if they had been at the same cultivation rank. Given that Chu Feng was unlikely to have any other means to raise his cultivation rank, he was doomed to lose this battle.</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen were worried for Chu Feng.</span><br><span>However, the truth was that Chu Feng had successfully dodged Feng Tiansheng&rsquo;s attack. In the first place, there was no way he could be defeated when he had a trump card like Divine Flitting to fall back on. Of course, he couldn&rsquo;t keep using it either, as it would burden his body.</span><br><span>As the light finally scattered, Chu Feng saw Feng Tiansheng kneeling on the ground, with his halberd barely holding him up.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master!&rdquo; the Totem Phoenix Clansmen exclaimed worriedly.</span><br><span>Fresh blood was spurting from Feng Tiansheng&rsquo;s mouth and his nostrils. The earlier self-explosion had resulted in severe injuries for him, to the point where even his golden aura had significantly weakened.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Feng Tiansheng anxiously searched around for the injured Chu Feng, only to clench his fists in indignance when he saw the latter floating unharmed in the sky. Unwilling to give up, he forced himself to stand up once more.</span></p></div>
