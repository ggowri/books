        <h1>Chapter 4894</h1>
        <div>: Are You Able to Control a Man Like That?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Menglai, is Chu Feng still in control of the energy here?&rdquo; a feeble voice sounded.<br>It was from Shengguang Haoxuan.<br>Thanks to the treatment from the other juniors of the Holy Valley, his arms and tongue had been reattached. It was just that Shengguang Menglai&rsquo;s attacks were too ferocious that even though his body had recovered, his soul remained damaged. He was still in a weakened state.<br>&ldquo;The current Chu Feng is no longer of threat. Let&rsquo;s hurry up and cultivate,&rdquo; Shengguang Menglai said.<br>She didn&rsquo;t want to mess with Chu Feng anymore after the earlier incident.<br>Upon hearing those words, the other juniors of the Holy Valley began sitting down to sense the fortune in the air.<br>However, Shengguang Haoxuan spoke up once again.<br>&ldquo;Menglai, where does that spirit formation gate lead to?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What are you planning?&rdquo; Shengguang Menglai asked.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng has humiliated me. I have to end his life,&rdquo; Shengguang Haoxuan said.<br>&ldquo;You want to kill him?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xintian was furious to hear those words. She pointed a finger at Shengguang Haoxuan and bellowed, &ldquo;Shengguang Haoxuan, just how low can you stoop? You have no grudge with Chu Feng, but you have been picking on him ever since he first appeared. Chu Feng could have killed all of us earlier, but he chose to spare us despite everything we have done to him. Don&rsquo;t you think that you&rsquo;re being too narrow-minded here? If anything, you&rsquo;re the one who is smearing mud on our Holy Valley&rsquo;s reputation here!&rdquo;<br>Those words left Shengguang Haoxuan deeply perplexed.<br>&ldquo;Xintian, what&rsquo;s wrong with you? Why are you siding with an outsider?&rdquo; Shengguang Haoxuan asked.<br>&ldquo;So what if he&rsquo;s an outsider? Unlike you, Shengguang Haoxuan, I have principles. What you&rsquo;re doing is simply too ugly!&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian said.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Haoxuan still wanted to say something, but Shengguang Menglai suddenly interjected.<br>&ldquo;Enough, let&rsquo;s drop this here. We&rsquo;ll leave this matter for Lord Baimei and the others to decide once we leave this cultivation realm,&rdquo; Shengguang Menglai said.<br>&ldquo;Since we&rsquo;re on the subject of Lord Baimei, I&rsquo;ll get straight to the point. Chu Feng must die here, and this is an order I received from Lord Baimei himself,&rdquo; Shengguang Haoxuan said.<br>Those words shocked the crowd. They quickly turned their eyes toward Shengguang Haoxuan.<br>The one who found it hardest to believe was no other than Shengguang Xintian.<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Haoxuan, the audacity of you! How dare you make use of my grandfather to justify your petty vengeance?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xintian began releasing her oppressive might, seemingly intent to come to blows with Shengguang Haoxuan if the latter couldn&rsquo;t offer her a satisfactory explanation.<br>&ldquo;I, Shengguang Haoxuan, wouldn&rsquo;t dare to make light of Lord Baimei&rsquo;s name. It&rsquo;s the truth that Lord Baimei has sent a voice transmission to me, ordering me to get rid of Chu Feng in this cultivation realm. I don&rsquo;t know why he made such an order, but I can swear on my name that what I&rsquo;ve said is the absolute truth. If there&rsquo;s any falsehood in my words, I&rsquo;m willing to face the death penalty!&rdquo; Shengguang Haoxuan said.<br>Shengguang Xintian was put at a loss for words.<br>While Shengguang Haoxuan would go overboard from time to time, he wouldn&rsquo;t go to the extent of falsifying Lord Baimei&rsquo;s order. On top of that, he even said that he would willingly take on the death penalty if there was any falsehood in his words. This added credibility to his claim.<br>&ldquo;If Lord Baimei truly wishes to kill Chu Feng, why can&rsquo;t he just sentence Chu Feng to death himself? There&rsquo;s no need for him to go through you,&rdquo; Shengguang Chuyao posed a reasonable doubt.<br>He had a fair amount of respect for Chu Feng. If possible, he wouldn&rsquo;t want Chu Feng to die.<br>&ldquo;How am I to know that? Why don&rsquo;t you ask Lord Baimei himself? Anyway, all I know is that Lord Baimei would surely blame me if I fail to carry out his orders. I hope that none of you will stop me here, or else you can take responsibility for the failure.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Shengguang Haoxuan rose to his feet and began making his way toward the spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment!&rdquo; Shengguang Menglai suddenly spoke up.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still some time before the departure gate leading out of the Holy Lotus Tree opens, so Chu Feng won&rsquo;t be able to make his escape in the meantime. Since it was Lord Baimei who ordered you to kill Chu Feng, I won&rsquo;t stop you anymore. However, it&rsquo;s not too late for you to head over after cultivating here. Don&rsquo;t waste this precious opportunity,&rdquo; Shengguang Menglai said.<br>After saying her piece, she closed her eyes and began feeling the fortune lurking in the air. She opted for the safe method instead of the riskier one.<br>She knew that the method Chu Feng demonstrated earlier was correct, and Shengguang Chuyao had executed it flawlessly as well. The problem was that Shengguang Chuyao wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to withstand the violent fortune.<br>Shengguang Menglai was confident that her talent was above that of Shengguang Chuyao, but she wasn&rsquo;t certain if she could withstand that violent fortune.<br>Shengguang Chuyao was fortunate to have Chu Feng around to save her, but she had no one to save her if she were to screw up. Thus, after careful consideration, she decided not to take a risk here and instead opt for the safer way.<br>Shengguang Menglai&rsquo;s attitude was already made clear here. She wouldn&rsquo;t stop Shengguang Haoxuan if he wanted to teach Chu Feng a lesson. With nothing much to see anymore, the other disciples turned their attention toward their cultivation. They didn&rsquo;t want to miss this opportunity.<br>Shoosh!<br>A silhouette suddenly flitted into the spirit formation gate. It was<br>.<br>Despite Shengguang Menglai&rsquo;s advice, he still wanted to kill Chu Feng right away even if it meant squandering this precious cultivation opportunity. This showed how much hatred he felt for Chu Feng at this very moment.<br>Shoosh!<br>Shortly after<br>left, another figure dashed for the spirit formation gate.<br>Weng!<br>However, a formidable martial power suddenly formed a golden barrier around the spirit formation gate, sealing it off. That figure had no choice but to screech to a halt.<br>&ldquo;Big sister Menglai, why are you stopping me?&rdquo;<br>Standing in front of the golden barrier made out of martial power, Shengguang Xintian questioned Shengguang Menglai.<br>It turned out that Shengguang Xintian was the one who was trying to enter the spirit gate formation after<br>.<br>&ldquo;Xintian, I remember you once told me that you&rsquo;re fond of powerful men. I know what&rsquo;s running through your mind,&rdquo; Shengguang Menglai said.<br>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be&hellip; Miss Xintian likes Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I-is that for real?!&rdquo;<br>The juniors of the Holy Valley were shocked by the news.<br>They couldn&rsquo;t understand why Shengguang Xintian was suddenly taking such an amicable attitude toward Chu Feng. It would explain it if Shengguang Xintian harbored feelings for him, but that in itself opened another can of worms.<br>Putting aside Shengguang Xintian&rsquo;s identity and strength, she had only met Chu Feng not too long ago. Heck, they were even fighting against each other just a moment ago!<br>It was incomprehensible how she would suddenly fall for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Let me in,&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian said.<br>&ldquo;Xintian,<br>might be arrogant, but he&rsquo;s not foolish. I trust that he wouldn&rsquo;t lie over such a matter. It&rsquo;s likely that your grandfather has really issued an order for Chu Feng&rsquo;s death.<br>&ldquo;As for why your grandfather wanted Chu Feng to die here, I reckon that it might be because there&rsquo;s someone in the Holy Valley who&rsquo;s trying to protect Chu Feng. Regardless of the reason, Lord Baimei has always prioritized the Holy Valley&rsquo;s interests over all things else. I trust that he has his own considerations for issuing such an order. You&rsquo;re a member of our Holy Valley too, as well as Lord Baimei&rsquo;s granddaughter. You shouldn&rsquo;t be siding with Chu Feng here.<br>&ldquo;Besides, Chu Feng is also an incredibly dangerous individual. Despite being an outsider, he was able to swiftly grasp the situation here and turn the tables on us. I was outwitted by him despite having the Holy Lotus Rock in my hands. Are you certain that you put your reins on a man like that?&rdquo; Shengguang Menglai asked.<br></p></div>
