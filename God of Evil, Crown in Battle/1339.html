        <div> - Determining The Winner<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;As the saying goes, there can never be too much deception in war.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You were able to dodge my attack, that is your skill.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Likewise, the fact that I can mount a sneak attack, that is my skill.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In a fight, everything is determined by one&rsquo;s skill. Thus, how could I possibly be said to be despicable?&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile on his face. Even though Wang Qiang&rsquo;s mouth was very shameless, Chu Feng was unable to hate Wang Qiang when fighting against him. Instead, the entire time, he had been feeling that this Wang Qiang was very interesting.<br>&ldquo;Well spoken!&rdquo; When Chu Feng said those words, there were actually people who began to cheer for him and, some even started to applaud.<br>The majority of these people who were cheering for Chu Feng were experts from the older generation. They were truly subdued by Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength.<br>&ldquo;I, I, I tru, tru, truly didn&rsquo;t expect that yo, yo, you would be pr, pretty good with your mo, mouth e to win ag, against you in a battle of words.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, wh, what a cultivator ne, needs is not a skill, skillful mouth that ca, can speak. Instead, they need to, to have real st, strength. I am, am going to be, be ser, serious this time. It&rsquo;s ti, time for you to re, realize my greatness.&rdquo;<br>After he said those words, Wang Qiang flipped his palm. Right away, martial power began to soar. As that martial power soared into the sky, a golden lotus flower soon appeared.<br>After that lotus flower was formed, light immediately began to shine. As the light began to radiate all over, countless needle-like substances of light were explosively shot forth from that golden lotus flower. Those needle-like substances were all flying toward Chu Feng.<br>This was a martial skill. Its rank was also not very high. However, being used by Wang Qiang, it was able to unleash an extremely powerful and domineering might that could not be underestimated.<br>At the very least, when facing this sort of martial skill, it was extremely difficult for Chu Feng&rsquo;s Illusory Palm to have any use, much less contend against it.<br>However, as Chu Feng possessed many martial skills, he would naturally not easily admit defeat. Chu Feng stood in the air and formed a bow with his left hand and an arrow with his right hand. In an instant, a golden-bright and dazzling bow was being held by him in his hands.<br>Furthermore, the moment he pulled the bow back, an arrow appeared on the bowstring. As he moved his hand back and forth, swishing sounds were being heard nonstop. &ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh,&rdquo; countless golden arrows were explosively shot toward Wang Qiang&rsquo;s golden lotus flower needles like a meteor rain.<br>&ldquo;Bang, bang, bang&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The collision between the two martial skills produced numerous energy ripples. However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s Bow of Hundred Transformations was not only powerful, it was also full of changes. Being perfectly controlled by Chu Feng, his Bow of Hundred Transformations obtained absolute dominance over Wang Qiang&rsquo;s martial skill.<br>Each wave of Chu Feng&rsquo;s arrows was stronger than the previous wave. As wave upon wave of arrows were shot toward Wang Qiang&rsquo;s offense, they continuously destroyed Wang Qiang&rsquo;s golden lotus flower needles.<br>In the end, they arrived all the way to Wang Qiang himself and nearly completely shattered his golden lotus flower needles.<br>At this time, Wang Qiang realized that the situation wasn&rsquo;t good. Thus, he changed his martial skill and unleashed an even more powerful martial skill as a counterattack.<br>However, regardless of what martial skill Wang Qiang used, Chu Feng would always use another martial skill of the same rank as the one Wang Qiang used, and suppress Wang Qiang&rsquo;s martial skill with the tiniest bit of superiority.<br>As for Wang Qiang, he was not to be outdone. Every single time he realized that his martial skill was inferior to Chu Feng&rsquo;s, he would always unleash a martial skill of a higher ranking than the one before.<br>Just like this, in a back and forth manner, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang unleashed a battle of martial skills in mid-air.<br>From rank three martial skills, their martial skills continued to increase in rank. In the end, the two of them were using rank nine martial skills.<br>By the time they reached rank nine martial skills, the destructive power of those martial skills were not something that the lower ranked martial skills from before could compare with. The power of their martial skills that were wreaking havoc through the skies was extremely frightening.<br>In these sorts of circumstances, the people from the Sealing Ancient Village began to set up spirit formations with the powerful world spiritists present to seal the range of Chu Feng and Wang Qiang&rsquo;s battle so as to prevent their martial skills&rsquo; energy ripples from implicating others or destroying the surrounding scenery.<br>&ldquo;Demons, those are two demon-level characters.&rdquo;<br>When the spirit formations that they set up really managed to come in contact with the martial skills that Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were using, they began to have a whole new level of respect for them.<br>That was because the energy ripples created by the collision of Chu Feng and Wang Qiang&rsquo;s martial skills were extremely powerful. Anyone below Half Martial Emperor would simply be incapable of withstanding those energy ripples.<br>In the end, even rank one Half Martial Emperors began to feel an enormous pressure. Only when the rank two Half Martial Emperors stepped forward to help did they manage to withstand the energy ripples created by Chu Feng and Wang Qiang&rsquo;s martial skills.<br>However, both Chu Feng and Wang Qiang only possessed cultivations of rank seven Martial Kings. The attacks from two rank seven Martial Kings actually managed to make even rank one Half Martial Emperors feel pressure upon blocking them. What did this signify?<br>This signified that the battle power that Chu Feng and Wang Qiang possessed was truly at a heaven-defying level, surpassing three entire levels. They were definitely demon-level characters.<br>&ldquo;So powerful, exactly what are the origins of these two little fellows?&rdquo;<br>The battle between Chu Feng and Wang Qiang had already alarmed the Sealing Ancient Village. An old man from the Sealing Ancient Village with the cultivation of rank two Half Martial Emperor looked to the battlefield and the two fighters in the sky. He started to deeply frown with a pensive expression on his face. He did not know whether the arrival of two demon-level characters like them to their Sealing Ancient Village was a good thing or a bad thing for them.<br>&ldquo;Wuuuaooo~~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a snarl sounded from the horizon. At the same time that the snarl was heard, a very frightening might actually passed through the spirit formation set up by the Half Martial Emperors and reached the outside.<br>When they turned their gazes to look, everyone present had their mouths wide open. They were all frightened by the scene in the sky.<br>At this moment, Wang Qiang&rsquo;s black hair was fluttering in the wind as he began to form hand seals. Coldness filled his two little eyes and a dangerous aura was emitting from within him.<br>At this moment, he was like a completely different person from before.<br>If the previous him could have been said to be like a clown, then&hellip; the current him would be like a cold-blooded killer.<br>However, what was the most shocking was not the change to Wang Qiang himself. Instead, it was the huge monster that appeared before him.<br>It was a purple beast. The beast was enormous, over a hundred meters long and several tens of meters tall. Its entire body was composed of a purple-colored crystal.<br>Standing in the sky, it appeared like a mountain formed of purple crystals. Its might was omnipresent and it appeared to be extremely terrifying.<br>In addition to its terrifying size, its appearance was also extremely fierce. It looked like a lion, and yet also like a tiger. However, it was much scarier than either a lion or a tiger.<br>Its enormous beast claws appeared to be capable of ripping apart everything in its path. Those sharp fangs seemed to be able to chew through all living things.<br>However, the most frightening thing about it was its eyes. Its eyes were not very large, they were only the size of a millstone. However, it possessed over a hundred such eyes. Those hundred plus eyes were all densely packed on its forehead. Furthermore, each and every single eye was emitting a very strong killing intent. Not only were they very frightening, they also appeared to be very nauseating. Essentially, when looking at those eyes, one would tremble with fear.<br>&ldquo;Earthen Taboo Martial Skill, what a powerful Earthen Taboo Martial Skill,&rdquo; Suddenly, an expert from the older generation exclaimed in shock. He managed to recognize what sort of thing that enormous purple crystal beast in the sky was.<br>Although it had a very life-like appearance, gave off a very life-like aura and appeared to be a real living animal, it was actually a Taboo Martial Skill. Furthermore, it was an extremely powerful Earthen Taboo Martial Skill.<br>&ldquo;This Earthen Taboo Martial Skill is quite remarkable. It is stronger than all of the martial skills your previous opponents have used. It is most definitely a peak level Earthen Taboo Martial Skill.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This shameless-mouthed crooked lips actually skipped Mortal Taboo Martial Skills after the rank nine martial skills and directly used such a powerful Earthen Taboo Martial Skill. It would seem that he is planning to use this martial skill to determine the outcome of his battle with you. Chu Feng, you cannot be careless. You should directly use the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash to finish him,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Hearing what Eggy said, Chu Feng nodded. He was thinking the same thing.<br></p></div>
