        <div> - All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Tang Ying was the Young Miss of the Tang Family. She was Chu Feng&rsquo;s friend from when he first came to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>Originally, Chu Feng was a benefactor to the Tang Family. However, for the sake of currying favor from Luyang&rsquo;s Pavilion, not only did the Tang Family betray Chu Feng and try to kill him, they even sold Tang Ying away.<br>Tang Ying was a pitiful person. That said, she was extremely grateful toward Chu Feng. After what had happened in the past, she felt that she was very weak and would become Chu Feng&rsquo;s burden. As such, without any hesitation, Tang Ying refused the Red Butterfly Society&rsquo;s offer to shelter her and left together with her maid.<br>In the blink of an eye, it had been several years since they were separated. Chu Feng never expected to meet Tang Ying again.<br>However, when Tang Ying saw Chu Feng, she had a hesitant expression, and did not dare to recognize him. At the same time, great shock emerged in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? You couldn&rsquo;t possibly have forgotten about me, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile on his face.<br>Chu Feng was very happy to be able to see Tang Ying.<br>After all, Tang Ying could be considered to be the first friend he had made after arriving in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>After separating, Chu Feng had expected to never see her again. Being able to reunite with her today could truly be considered fate.<br>Tang Ying did not say anything. Her large eyes were fixed onto Chu Feng the entire time.<br>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t possibly really not recognize me, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng scratched his head awkwardly.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you really still remember me?&rdquo; Tang Ying finally spoke. At the same time she spoke, her eyes started to tear up.<br>&ldquo;Foolish girl, what are you talking about? How could I not remember you?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;But&hellip; you&rsquo;re already such a grand character now. How could you still remember an insignificant person like me?&rdquo; Tang Ying said.<br>Seeing Tang Ying reacting like this, Chu Feng finally realized why she did not attempt to meet him even after arriving there.<br>Chu Feng had no idea what sort of status he held in Tang Ying&rsquo;s heart. However, Chu Feng knew that she constantly had him on her mind.<br>Even her decision to visit Hero City was merely so that she could have a look at Chu Feng.<br>However, she did not plan to meet Chu Feng. She felt that compared to Chu Feng, who had become a grand existence in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, she was still an ordinary nobody.<br>Even if she were to die, no one would remember her. She felt that she was simply and completely negligible.<br>She was scared, scared that Chu Feng would have already forgotten her, or would look down on her and refuse to acknowledge her.<br>Her thoughts were understandable too. After all, the world of martial cultivators was a world where one&rsquo;s strength and self-interest was the most important.<br>For the sake of their benefit, her family had abandoned her. From that, it could be seen how important self-interest and benefits were to martial cultivators.<br>Thus, she felt that, with how enormously weak she was, she was currently unqualified to even be Chu Feng&rsquo;s friend.<br>Although the two of them both existed in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, they were simply people from two different worlds.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand landed lightly on Tang Ying&rsquo;s shoulder. With a smile on his face, he said, &ldquo;How could I forget about you, my friend?&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and a layer of golden-bright and dazzling spirit power sprinkled down like starlight. The light enveloped Tang Ying and her maid, A&rsquo;Cai.<br>As the spirit power enveloped their bodies, Tang Ying and A&rsquo;Cai&rsquo;s appearances began to change.<br>They no longer appeared ordinary-looking. Although their appearances could not be considered to be devastatingly beautiful like celestial fairies, they had become decently beautiful women.<br>These were the original appearances of Tang Ying and A&rsquo;Cai.<br>When Chu Feng separated from Tang Ying and A&rsquo;Cai, the two girls had specially requested that he give them ordinary appearances.<br>The two of them had had enough of the mutual deception of the world of martial cultivators. They did not wish to court unnecessary disaster because of their beauty, and only wanted to live ordinarily for the rest of their lives.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seemingly able to sense that her appearance had returned to how it was originally, Tang Ying was at a complete loss.<br>&ldquo;You can return to being the person you were before. I dare to guarantee that no one will dare to harm you again,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s smile was so very warm. His smile was like a ray of sunshine that landed directly on Tang Ying&rsquo;s heart.<br>At that moment, Tang Ying was completely moved. The tears in her eyes suddenly rolled down her cheeks, moistening her charming face.<br>Chu Feng did not urge Tang Ying to not cry. Instead, he hugged Tang Ying in his bosom.<br>Since she wanted to cry, he had decided to let her cry to her heart&rsquo;s content.<br>After being hugged by Chu Feng, Tang Ying finally realized that Chu Feng had not changed even with the fame and strength he currently possessed.<br>Chu Feng was still that same Chu Feng. He was still as reliable as before.<br>&hellip;...<br>After that, a place for Tang Ying to live was arranged inside Hero City. She would stay with Li Xiaoli and the others.<br>As for Hero City, it had begun to plan how to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect with its allied powers.<br>The proposal made by Hero City was approved by both the Immortal Sword School and the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple.<br>Merely, not only was the Infant Soul Sect powerful, but the headquarters of the Infant Soul Sect had always been hidden too.<br>As such, finding the headquarters of the Infant Soul Sect had become the most difficult problem at hand.<br>Ying Mingchao felt that the matter would be dangerous. Thus, he refused to allow Chu Feng to participate.<br>As such, Chu Feng was only able to remain in Hero City. However, he was not idle the entire time.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was holding a book in hand while sitting upright in his room. He was reading the book carefully.<br>That book was very simple, unadorned and shabby. However, the book gave off a very dense Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura.<br>Moreover, Chu Feng had been reading that book for several days already.<br>The title of the book was &lsquo;All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart.&rsquo;<br>Back then, for the sake of thanking Chu Feng, Ying Mingchao had forcibly given Chu Feng his Cosmos Sack.<br>There were countless treasures in that Cosmos Sack. In terms of quality, the treasures in that Cosmos Sack greatly surpassed the treasures from the Cosmos Sack that the World Spiritist Saintess offered to Chu Feng for reconciliation.<br>Chu Feng felt that the most valuable treasure in the Cosmos Sack was the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart.<br>This All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart was written by a person known as Sage All Equilibrium. It recorded how world spiritists should refine weapons.<br>The All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart did not record how to refine specific weapons. Instead, it provided world spiritists techniques to refine all sorts of weapons.<br>In a nutshell, similar things possessed a common aspect to them. If Chu Feng was able to master the contents of the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart, he would gain benefits regardless of what sort of weapon he might attempt to refine in the future.<br>This was similar to how Chu Feng possessed the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip that was helpful toward martial skills in his dantian. With that God Bestowment Bamboo Slip, his martial skills, regardless of what they might be, would always be a tier above those of ordinary individuals.<br>The All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart was a very rare book. Even though Chu Feng had been meticulously studying it for several days now, he was still unable to understand it completely.<br>However, through the efforts of the past several days, Chu Feng knew that the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart was not complete.<br>Furthermore, the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart also mentioned that world spirit techniques were capable of increasing one&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>Powerful world spiritists did not need to meticulously study martial cultivation methods. They would be able to increase their cultivation by only meticulously studying world spirit techniques.<br>For example, if Chu Feng was able to completely grasp the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart and use the method recorded in it to refine a weapon, not only would Chu Feng be able to gain a whole new level of insight while refining the weapon, but he would also be able to obtain martial comprehension.<br>This was something that Chu Feng had never experienced before. Thus, he was very excited.<br>If what was said in the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart was true, Chu Feng would have another method to increase his cultivation in the future. What sort of sensation would that be?<br>Chu Feng felt that would most definitely be an extremely wondrous sensation.<br>&ldquo;Stop studying it so meticulously. That is only a fragment. Regardless of how thoroughly you study it, you will still not be able to use its contents to refine weapons,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>It was not that Her Lady Queen was trying to attack Chu Feng psychologically. Rather, after Chu Feng discovered that the book was only an incomplete fragment, he had gone to find Ying Mingchao to ask him about whether or not he knew about the whereabouts of the remainder of the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart.<br>Ying Mingchao told Chu Feng that he had obtained the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart unintentionally, and had no idea about the whereabouts of the remainder of the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart.<br>Even though Chu Feng had been studying the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart for several days now, he was still unable to comprehend it. However, it was not because his comprehension ability was lacking. Rather, it was because the book itself was incomplete.<br>In other words, if Chu Feng were to continue studying the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart, he might be able to grasp something, or he might grasp nothing.<br>Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s intention was clear. She did not want to Chu Feng to waste time on that All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s a letter for you,&rdquo; Suddenly, a voice sounded from outside Chu Feng&rsquo;s palace.<br>&ldquo;Who sent the letter?&rdquo; Chu Feng was surprised. Practically all of his acquaintances in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm were gathered in Hero City. If they needed him, they could come find him directly. There was simply no need for them to write him a letter.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, there is no indication of who the sender is on the letter,&rdquo; The person outside said.<br>Chu Feng did not ask anymore. Instead, he opened his door and received the letter from that person outside.<br>The moment Chu Feng touched the letter, he discovered that it was no small matter. Unless one were to open the letter, one would find it very difficult to see the contents inside.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for your trouble,&rdquo; Chu Feng thanked the letter deliverer courteously. Then, he closed the door to his palace again and opened the letter.<br>When Chu Feng saw the contents of the letter, he suddenly clenched the hands that he was holding the letter with. A worried expression emerged in his eyes.<br><br></p></div>
