        <div> - Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s Strength<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Girl, with the way you&rsquo;re acting, it seems like if I don&rsquo;t give it to you, you&rsquo;ll forcibly snatch it from me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile.<br>Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s expression remained grave. &ldquo;It is very important to me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, tell me why you insist on seeing Grandmaster Yuan Shu. If you tell me, I&rsquo;ll give it to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you refuse to tell me, you&rsquo;ll have to take it from me with your ability,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a joking tone.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Chu Feng&rsquo;s words left his mouth, an invisible oppressive pressure swept forth from Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s body and instantly covered the entire region.<br>Even Chu Feng was forced back several steps before finally stabilizing himself.<br>It was her oppressive might, a rank six Exalted-level oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;Girl, you&rsquo;re actually a rank six Exalted?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s strongest person of the younger generation is simply not that Nangong Yifan at all. Instead, it&rsquo;s you," Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>He had witnessed Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s strength the first time they'd met.<br>Merely, at that time, Chu Feng was far weaker than her. Thus, he was only able to sense that she possessed unfathomable strength, but could not tell how strong she really was.<br>However, at that moment, he discovered that Yin Zhuanghong was truly very powerful.<br>At least, she was much more powerful than himself, Nangong Yifan and the others back then.<br>Even for Chu Feng now, even after he had become much more powerful than before and gained the cultivation of rank five Exalted, his cultivation was still weaker than hers.<br>&ldquo;I do not wish to harm you,&rdquo; as Yin Zhuanghong spoke, she extended her open palm towards Chu Feng. She wanted him to give her the title plate.<br>Chu Feng smiled. Not only did he not comply with her demand, but he instead stored the title plate within his gown.<br>&ldquo;If you refuse to tell me the reason, you&rsquo;ll have to snatch this title plate from me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, lightning began to flicker around his body, and the character &lsquo;Divine&rsquo; appeared on his forehead.<br>He had unleashed his Divine level Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor at the same time. With them, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation increased by two successive levels, going from rank five Exalted to rank seven Exalted.<br>Sensing Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation, Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s expression changed somewhat.<br>Although she had managed to see through his disguise, she had not seen through his cultivation.<br>She was surprised by the changes in his cultivation.<br>After all, when they were at the Divine Armament Villa, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation had only been that of a rank three Exalted.<br>It had only been a short period of time since then. Yet, his cultivation had actually increased to rank five Exalted.<br>Even Yin Zhuanghong felt astonished by his cultivation speed.<br>That said, her shock lasted but an instant, and was replaced with coldness.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, fiery hot flames were released from Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s body. Coiling around her, the flames soared into the sky and scattered in all directions. At the same time, an enormous fiery phoenix could be seen behind her.<br>As the flames surged forth, Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s cultivation increased from rank six Exalted to rank seven Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Treasure? I also have one.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled. Then, he unleashed the power of his Fire Qilin Talisman. His cultivation increased from rank seven Exalted to rank eight Exalted, and surpassed Yin Zhuanghong's once again.<br>&ldquo;This feeling?&rdquo;<br>Right after Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation increased, before he could even flaunt, his expression changed, and his emotions became complicated.<br>Originally, Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s treasure was emitting flames of extremely high temperature.<br>The intense heat caused their surroundings to be as hot as the deep abyss of a place covered in magma.<br>The only reason why Chu Feng and the surroundings were unaffected was because his cultivation was strong enough, and the construction in the surroundings tough enough.<br>If the surroundings were made of ordinary materials, merely the heat would be enough to melt everything and turn it into smoke.<br>Even though the heat would not affect Chu Feng, he had to admit that it was extremely intense.<br>However, at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly felt a chilling sensation.<br>It was bone-chilling cold that had engulfed the entire area.<br>But, that intense heat was clearly still present.<br>Hot and cold, two different types of power, had actually appeared at the same time. Furthermore, they both originated from Yin Zhuanghong.<br>When Chu Feng looked to Yin Zhuanghong again, he was able to see many blue gaseous substances being emitted from her body.<br>That was the origin of the cold.<br>&ldquo;Divine Power. This girl is actually a Divine Body.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder she&rsquo;s so cold. Turns out, it's her natural disposition.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng gasped with admiration...<br>Wearing a red dress and emitting burning flames from all over her body, Yin Zhuanghong resembled a saintess of flames.<br>However, her red dress was merely a physical possession, whereas her treasure was something she'd gained control of later on.<br>However, Divine Power was different. It was a power innate to her.<br>Her Divine Power was bone-chilling cold. It was no wonder Yin Zhuanghong was so cold.<br>After unleashing her Divine Power, Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s cultivation increased once again. Like Chu Feng, she became a rank eight Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a cold ray flashed past and a sword appeared in Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s hand. She aimed that sword at Chu Feng.<br>That was the Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword.<br>Seeing the Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword, Chu Feng flicked his wrist, revealed his Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword, and pointing it at Yin Zhuanghong.<br>After the two swords appeared, their auras began to overflow, surging and mixing with each other.<br>They were like two lovers seeing each other and embracing one another passionately.<br>That was normal. After all, the Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword and Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword were a pair.<br>Seeing the strange change to the two swords, Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s fierce gaze suddenly started to flicker.<br>She seemed to suddenly recall the story about the two swords, and how she'd obtained her Red Jade Mandarin Duck Sword.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do not force me. I do not wish to fight you," said Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;Girl, if you want to defeat me, you&rsquo;d best not hold back.&rdquo; Compared to the stern Yin Zhuanghong, Chu Feng had a smile on his face the entire time.<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, a look of ruthlessness flashed through Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>The intense heat and bone-chilling cold began to wreak havoc. They formed an enormous vortex and soared into the sky. It seemed like the descent of doomsday.<br>It was Yin Zhuanghong.<br>The flames and coldness emitted by Yin Zhaunghong were actually mixing with one another.<br>With a situation like that, Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s cultivation actually increased again. From rank eight Exalted, her cultivation increased to rank nine Exalted.<br>She had reached peak Exalted!!!<br>One should know that Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s actual cultivation was only that of a rank six Exalted.<br>Relying on her treasure and Divine Power, Yin Zhuanghong had actually managed to increase her cultivation by three entire levels.<br>&ldquo;What a powerful Divine Power.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng revealed a look of shock after seeing Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s cultivation increase.<br>Even though it seemed like Yin Zhuanghong was only able to increase her cultivation again through her treasure and Divine Power, Chu Feng was able to tell that her treasure merely served as a supplement to her Divine Power. Her Divine Power was the main force behind her cultivation increase.<br>To be able to increase her cultivation by two levels using only her Divine Power, that was something very few people could accomplish.<br>From merely this, one could tell that Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s mastery of her Divine Power had reached incredible heights.<br>Sure enough, that girl was an actual genius. Before her, not to mention Nangong Yifan, even Linghu Hongfei would be eclipsed.<br>&ldquo;Must you force me to fight?&rdquo; Yin Zhuanghong asked with a stern voice. At the same time, there was impatience in her voice.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve won.&rdquo;<br>As for Chu Feng, he merely smiled. Then, he put away his Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword, took out the title plate and tossed it to Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Chu Feng actually still had his Divine Power that he hadn&rsquo;t used yet. If he insisted on fighting Yin Zhuanghong, he would not fear her at all.<br>Merely, he never had any intention to fight her from the very start. He only wanted to use the opportunity to gauge her strength.<br>Sure enough, Yin Zhuanghong had not disappointed him.<br>That girl was terrifyingly powerful.<br>After all&hellip; she was a person of the younger generation.<br>Holding the title plate, Yin Zhuanghong looked over at Chu Feng. She seemed to have realized something. &ldquo;You were testing me earlier?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Why are you not fighting against me then?&rdquo; asked Yin Zhaunghong.<br>&ldquo;Girl, you&rsquo;re abnormally powerful. I can&rsquo;t win against you. Thus, I naturally won&rsquo;t fight.&rdquo; Chu Feng shrugged his shoulders in a very helpless manner.<br>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; A look of suspicion flashed past Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that your eyes also managed to see through the fact that I possess Divine Power?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile.<br>Hearing those words, Yin Zhuanghong rolled her eyes at him. &ldquo;How could a Heavenly Bloodline possessor possibly possess Divine Power? I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re delusional.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
