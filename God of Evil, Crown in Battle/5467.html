        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Long Yuhong looked at Long Muxi in glee, as if she was already confident of her victory.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hold on for a moment!&rdquo;</span><br><span>An old woman suddenly rushed over with an entourage trailing behind her. She was dressed in resplendent clothes, a sign that she was also a high-standing person in the Totem Dragon Clan. Worried that the two of them would make a move, she positioned herself between Long Muxi and Long Yuhong.</span><br><span>She first looked at Long Muxi and bowed with a delighted smile. &ldquo;Paying respect to Miss Muxi. You&rsquo;re finally back!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Muxi quietly nodded in acknowledgment, but her face remained as cold as ever. However, the old woman didn&rsquo;t lose her temper, seemingly having already grown accustomed to it.</span><br><span>The old woman then turned to Long Yuhong and asked, &ldquo;Miss Yuhong, what&rsquo;s wrong? Why are you seeking a fight?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Grandma Jin, I wanted Long Muxi to know her place because she keeps mentioning past affairs. Times have already changed. She isn&rsquo;t the most talented female prodigy of our Totem Dragon Clan anymore,&rsquo; Long Yuhong said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you trying to claim that you&rsquo;re the most talented female prodigy of our Totem Dragon Clan instead?&rdquo; Long Muxi sneered in disdain.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Long Muxi, it&rsquo;s pathetic how you speak so much but refuse to fight me. Why don&rsquo;t you accept my challenge and prove yourself? I&rsquo;ll make sure to put you in your place,&rdquo; Long Yuhong scoffed.</span><br><span>Grandma Jin raised her hand to stop Long Yuhong and said, &ldquo;Miss Yuhong, let&rsquo;s talk things out instead. I won&rsquo;t be able to explain it to Lord Clan Chief if the two of you fight here.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Grandma Jin, Long Muxi isn&rsquo;t the only one who is the daughter of the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief here. I am the same too,&rdquo; Long Yuhong grumbled.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I mean.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Grandma Jin sounded flustered. She should be a person of considerable standing in the Totem Dragon Clan, but she subconsciously glanced at Long Yuhong&rsquo;s mother. This subtle gesture showed that she was afraid of Long Yuhong&rsquo;s mother.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>The seal on the formation suddenly violently shook. Many cracks began to show on it.</span><br><span>Grandma Jin&rsquo;s eyes glowed in delight. She turned to Long Yuhong and said, &ldquo;Miss Yuhong, I came here to inform you about the changes happening to the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted. You are the only one who hasn&rsquo;t used the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted yet, so this could be a fortuitous encounter for you.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Fortuitous encounter? What fortuitous encounter?&rdquo; Long Yuhong asked.</span><br><span>Long Muxi also thought of something that made her clench her fists in excitement. &ldquo;Grandma Jin, could it be that the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted has opened its eyes?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Indeed, Miss Muxi. The Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted has opened its eyes,&rdquo; Grandma Jin replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;To think that is the case! This means that another monstrous prodigy has appeared in our Totem Dragon Clan!&rdquo; someone amidst the spectators exclaimed.</span><br><span>The crowd began cheering aloud.</span><br><span>By listening to the discussions around him, Chu Feng quickly figured out what was going on. The Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted was usually in an open state, such that anyone who hadn&rsquo;t taken its test could step forward and challenge it.</span><br><span>However, there was a legend that when a top-notch prodigy descended upon the Totem Dragon Clan, the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted would open its eyes. So far, the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted had opened its eyes to Long Muxi and Long Chengyu&rsquo;s birth, and indeed, the two of them were monstrous prodigies who far surpassed their predecessors.</span><br><span>It was good news to the Totem Dragon Clansmen that another top-notch prodigy had appeared amongst them, but Long Yuhong wasn&rsquo;t too interested in it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What does this have to do with me?&rdquo; Long Yuhong scoffed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Miss Yuhong, the situation is different from usual. The Dragon Exalted released a white light when it opened its eyes for Miss Muxi and young master Chengyu&rsquo;s birth, but the light it is releasing this time around is golden,&rdquo; Grandma Jin said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What does that mean? Is there any difference?&rdquo; Long Yuhong asked.</span><br><span>In contrast, Long Muxi became even more agitated. It was rare for her to lose control of her emotions in such a manner. She grabbed Grandma JIn&rsquo;s shoulders and asked, </span><span>&ldquo;Grandma Jin, when did the phenomenon begin? Is it an hour ago?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Grandma Jin was taken aback. &ldquo;Miss Muxi, how did you know?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Instead of answering, Long Muxi turned to Chu Feng with an irrepressible smile. &ldquo;Chu Feng, I have underestimated you.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Does this have anything to do with me?&rdquo; Chu Feng was confused.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course it does, The Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted opened its eyes for you!&rdquo; Long Muxi exclaimed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; Chu Feng was confused.</span><br><span>It was the same for the crowd too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng? Is that the guy who won the late Martial Exalted level category in the Trial of the Strongest?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, it seems to be him. Is he acquainted with Miss Muxi?&rdquo;</span><br><span>No one in the crowd initially paid much heed to Chu Feng, but Long Muxi&rsquo;s words immediately made him the center of attention. Most of the crowd had eyes filled with envy. They would love more than anything to get on good terms with Long Muxi too, but the latter was too secretive and cold-natured for anyone to get on her good books.</span><br><span>Yet, Long Muxi was actually treating an outsider so warmly! How could they not feel jealous?</span><br><span>Even if Chu Feng had won the Trial of the Strongest&rsquo;s late Martial Exalted level category, most Totem Dragons Clansmen, especially the juniors, still thought that he was beneath them. They felt indignant that Long Muxi was treating an inferior better than them.</span><br><span>Long Yuhong shot a glance at Chu Feng before turning to Long Muxi, saying, &ldquo;What are you saying, Long Muxi? How could our Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted react to an outsider?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Long Yuhong, you have spent your years in our Totem Dragon Clan in vain! I would have never thought that you didn&rsquo;t even know about this,&rdquo; Long Muxi sneered. She looked at Grandma Jin and said, &ldquo;Grandma, why don&rsquo;t you tell her?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s crass to see how arrogant you&rsquo;re acting just because you know a tad bit more than me,&rdquo; Long Yuhong sneered. She hated losing to Long Muxi, even if it was in terms of knowledge.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Calm down, Miss Yuhong, Today is a day of celebrations!&rdquo; Grandma Jin quickly stopped Long Yuhong before sharing details on the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted.</span><br><span>The opening of the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted&rsquo;s eyes signaled not just the birth but the emergence of a prodigy too. These two cases could be discerned by the light that shone from the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted&rsquo;s opened eyes.</span><br><span>White light signaled the birth of a prodigy.</span><br><span>Golden light signaled the emergence of a prodigy.</span><br><span>&ldquo;According to the records of our Totem Dragon Clan, if a prodigy who has been recognized by the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted doesn&rsquo;t step forth to accept its test, it&rsquo;ll open its eyes and release a golden light to identify that individual,&rdquo; Grandma Jin said.</span><br><span>Long Yuhong was delighted to hear that.</span><br><span>The Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted had opened its eyes to Long Muxi and Long Chengyu, but it didn&rsquo;t react to her birth. She harbored anger toward the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted for refusing to acknowledge her, which was why she refused to take its test all this while.</span><br><span>However, things were going to change from this day onward.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Grandma Jin, are you saying that the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted is opening its eyes for me?&rdquo; Long Yuhong asked in excitement.</span><br><span>Being recognized by the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted meant that she would be on par with Long Muxi and Long Chengyu. Needless to say, she was excited about it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Miss Yuhong, there are very few juniors in our Totem Dragon Clan who have yet to take the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted&rsquo;s test, and you are the only one who is talented enough to be acknowledged by it. Who else could it be other than you?&rdquo; Grandma Jin said with a smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo; Long Yuhong burst into hearty laughter.</span><br><span>If Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t seen it with his own eyes, he would have never thought that someone who looked as pretty as that could smile in such an ugly manner.</span><br><span>After laughing for a while, Long Yuhong smugly looked at Long Muxi and provocatively asked, &ldquo;Long Muxi, did you just mention that the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted opened its eyes for that outsider?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Long Muxi replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right? Are you still saying that even now?&rdquo; Long Yuhong sneered. &ldquo;Have you lost your mind? Didn&rsquo;t you hear Grandma Jin&rsquo;s words? The Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted is opening its eyes for me, Long Yuhong! It&rsquo;s not for that outsider over there!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Yuhong arrogantly pointed her finger at Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>The seal on the formation suddenly shattered, and a beam of golden light shot out. The crowd, with the exception of Long Muxi, widened their eyes.</span><br><span>The beam of golden light fell on the person Long Yuhong was pointing her finger at&mdash;Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Long Yuhong froze up in her arrogant posture, but her expression looked as if someone had stuffed feces down her throat.</span></p></div>
