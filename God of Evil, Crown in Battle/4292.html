        <div> - Gusu&rsquo;s Change<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your father&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; the terrifying existence&rsquo;s voice sounded from the sky above.<br>&ldquo;My father?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, why are you asking that question?&rdquo;<br>Confusion filled Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart. A slight amount of unease appeared in his mind.<br>If it was someone else asking that question, Chu Feng would not be this nervous.<br>But, who was this existence asking this question?<br>For such a terrifying existence to suddenly inquire about his father, Chu Feng felt that it was most definitely not something good.<br>&ldquo;This Exalted does not possess any malice. There&rsquo;s no need to try to be secretive,&rdquo; said the terrifying existence.<br>&ldquo;This junior was not trying to be disrespectful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that I don&rsquo;t know why senior suddenly asked about my father.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, do you my father or was it because of something else?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng was actually very fearful of the existence in the sky.<br>After all, that terrifying existence was simply too powerful.<br>But, as this matter concerned his father, Chu Feng wanted to know exactly what was the cause for that question.<br>Even though his response might anger that terrifying existence, Chu Feng still chose to respond like so.<br>&ldquo;Brat, compared to back then, your cultivation had increased enormously. Your talent is extremely good.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As the saying goes, with a distinguished father, the son was sure to be outstanding too. This Exalted suspect that your father must be someone extraordinary.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I asked you about him out of curiosity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re unwilling to tell me, you can consider it that I&rsquo;ve never asked that question.&rdquo;<br>But, to Chu Feng&rsquo;s surprise, the terrifying existence was not only not angered, its words were also spoken in a very easy-going manner. It was so much that it was even praising Chu Feng.<br>Under this sort of circumstance, Chu Feng felt that he would be too disrespectful and lacking etiquette if he doesn&rsquo;t answer.<br>Besides, it was only a name. Countless people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm knew who Chu Feng&rsquo;s father was.<br>&ldquo;Senior, my father&rsquo;s name is Chu Xuanyuan,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Mn, got it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can return. This Exalted will take care of the matter with those three girls,&rdquo; said the terrifying existence.<br>&ldquo;In that case, this junior will take his leave.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng bowed respectfully before turning around to enter the teleportation formation.<br>After Chu Feng left, the giant eyes in the sky turned pensive.<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanyuan?&rdquo;<br>&hellip;...<br>By the time Chu Feng returned to the Galewind Hunting Clan, the Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had already received instructions from the terrifying existence. Thus, he did not have Chu Feng leave directly and instead arranged him to an exquisite palace within the Galewind Hunting Clan.<br>What Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know was that three people had secretly followed him into the palace the Galewind Hunting Clan arranged for him.<br>Those three people were Xianhai Shaoyu, Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er and Xianhai Gusu.<br>Of course, the three of them were concealed and Chu Feng did not detect them at all.<br>&ldquo;Judging from how joyous brother Chu Feng looks, things should&rsquo;ve gone very smoothly,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu with a beaming smile.<br>His condition was also very good. Although he experienced such a dangerous situation earlier, he seemed to not be affected by it.<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for young master&rsquo;s appearance, there might only be two possible outcomes,&rdquo; said Lady Gusu.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;ll necessarily be the case. That Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief seemed to be someone with principles.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He had long discovered Chu Feng and his master&rsquo;s intentions to infiltrate into their territory but did not directly attack them. Instead, he waited till after they&rsquo;ve made their infiltration to attack them. This meant that it might be possible for him to not actually kill Chu Feng,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Regardless, if it wasn&rsquo;t for young master, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to gain knowledge of everything that occurred so smoothly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, Lord young master, you must not act this way in the future,&rdquo; Lady Gusu&rsquo;s tone suddenly changed.<br>Even though she was clearly speaking with a pleading tone, she had a very serious expression on her face.<br>&ldquo;Senior Gusu, why not just tell me directly what you wanted to say,&rdquo; Xianhai Shaoyu turned around to face Lady Gusu.<br>&ldquo;I know that Lord young master has always been someone who does things his own way. Furthermore, Lord young master possesses your own judgement toward things.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But&hellip; there&rsquo;s not really too much of a friendship between you and that Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There was no need for you to take such risks for him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Ancient Era&rsquo;s existence from earlier was an extremely dangerous being. It was fortunate that it was only testing young master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that was not a test, young master would be faced with the danger of a potential death,&rdquo; said Lady Gusu.<br>&ldquo;Senior Gusu, the reason why I did what I did was because I felt that brother Chu Feng was someone worthy of me doing this for him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, aren&rsquo;t I fine?&rdquo; Xianhai Shaoyu said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Lord young master, this is the issue with you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are the heir to our Immortal Sea Fish Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With how important you are, how could you place yourself into danger for the sake of an outsider?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Regardless of whether it might be from you own viewpoint or from our entire clan&rsquo;s viewpoint, you shouldn&rsquo;t have done that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord young master, if you are to continue to act like this, this subordinate will have no choice but to report to Lord Clan Chief what happened as if.&rdquo;<br>After Lady Gusu finished saying those words, she bowed deeply.<br>&ldquo;Senior Gusu, are you threatening me here?&rdquo;<br>A faint change in expression appeared in Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;This subordinate wouldn&rsquo;t dare threaten Lord young master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply that this subordinate was responsible for ensuring Lord young master&rsquo;s safety. It is my responsibility to have Lord young master avoid dangerous places.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This subordinate personally witnessed Lord young master making a dangerous decision. Yet, I did not attempt to dissuade Lord young master with insistence. That is this subordinate&rsquo;s failure in duty.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If something is to truly happen to Lord young master, this subordinate would&rsquo;ve committed a gargantuan blunder.&rdquo;<br>After Lady Gusu said those words, she actually kneeled onto the ground.<br>&ldquo;Enough, enough. Things are not that serious.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior Gusu, please stand up. In the future, I&rsquo;ll listen to you.&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Shaoyu immediately supported Lady Gusu back up.<br>During all this, Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t say a single word.<br>Had it been before, she would choose to stand on Lady Gusu&rsquo;s side to persuade Xianhai Shaoyu without any hesitation.<br>But, after she came in contact with Chu Feng, she felt that Chu Feng was a decent person and wanted to help him too.<br>But, neither Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er or Xianhai Shaoyu noticed that when they thought that everything had returned to normal, that all the prior disagreements were things of the past, Lady Gusu&rsquo;s gaze had changed when she looked to Chu Feng again.<br>Xianhai Gusu was the person the Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief placed at Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s side.<br>Her duty was to guarantee Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s safety.<br>She was willing to uphold her duty by hook or by crook. It was so much that she could be completely cold-hearted.<br>Regardless of whether it was right or wrong, all that mattered was that it could ensure Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s safety.<br>She would eliminate everyone she felt to be an obstruction to her duty.<br>In the past, she had never viewed Chu Feng as an obstruction.<br>In fact, her impression of Chu Feng was rather good too.<br>But, after experiencing the killing intent from that terrifying existence today, she now held a new opinion of Chu feng.<br>&ldquo;Creak---&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, the tightly closed palace gate opened.<br>Then, three beautiful women walked in.<br>They were none other than Yan Ruyu, Murong Wan and Ya Fei.<br>Chu Feng immediately stood up from his seat upon seeing the three of them.<br>After seeing them in their current appearances, Chu Feng felt extremely complicated.<br>It was an emotional feeling mixed with guilt.<br>While Yan Ruyu, Murong Wan and Ya Fei still had the appearances of Galewind Hunting Clansmen, Chu Feng was able to tell merely from looking at their expressions that the real them had returned.<br></p></div>
