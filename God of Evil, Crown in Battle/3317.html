        <div> - Could It Be A Divine Beast?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That is?"<br>At that moment, an expression of joy flashed past Chu Feng's eyes. Then, he actually flew back down and descended before that egg.<br>At that moment, not only was that egg shining brightly and dazzling like the sun, but it was also emitting a special scent.<br>That scent actually contained martial comprehension.<br>Chu Feng had been to many sacred cultivation grounds and obtained plenty martial comprehension left behind by his seniors from those sacred cultivation grounds, and increased his cultivation thanks to them.<br>However, the natural energies from those cultivation grounds would either be obtained through looking at them or sensing them. As such, it was the first time that Chu Feng had witnessed natural energies and martial comprehension obtained from his sense of smell.<br>Although this method was very special, Chu Feng would not miss out on such an opportunity to increase his cultivation.<br>Chu Feng arrived before the egg and discovered that the natural energies grew even denser. Thus, Chu Feng took a deep breath.<br>"Fuck, this odor..."<br>After breathing in a mouthful, the flavor changed. Not only did it become incomparable smelly, so much that it caused Chu Feng to feel nauseated, but the odor even managed to cause Chu Feng to panic. Even his train of thought became chaotic.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng felt very uncomfortable. His head was in a complete chaos and his heart felt very agitated. It was as if there was a giant boulder crushing his chest. It was a very painful sensation, so painful that it was driving him mad.<br>That said, as Chu Feng struggled in pain, he was actually able to feel martial comprehension.<br>However, that martial comprehension dissipated as the stench faded away, and his frame of mind returned to normal.<br>Chu Feng hurriedly adjusted his awareness, allowing his rationality to return. Ultimately, he managed to comprehend a bit of the martial comprehension before it completely disappeared.<br>Had it not been for the fact that Chu Feng managed to gain martial comprehension from the odor, Chu Feng would definitely think that odor to be some sort of toxic gas.<br>It was precisely because Chu Feng gained martial comprehension from it that he came to deduce that the egg... was a cultivation treasure.<br>"It would be great if there wasn't anything alive inside the egg. However... if there is, then it would likely be something extraordinary."<br>"Eggy, if you're awake, would you suggest for me to retrieve this egg, or to keep it here and distance myself far from it?" Staring at the egg, Chu Feng muttered quietly.<br>Chu Feng's gaze was flickering nonstop. He was pondering the matter.<br>The egg was helpful in terms of martial cultivation. However, it contained an unknown danger. If the egg would truly bring about danger, it would likely be extremely difficult for him to stop it.<br>"As the saying goes, one must seek out riches and honor amongst danger. This holds true even more on the path of martial cultivation. Eggy, I think that if you were awake, you would want me to retrieve this egg."<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng picked up the egg. However, he did not directly put it away. Instead, he set up a sealing formation and sealed the egg tightly.<br>The sealing formation that he set up was formless and invisible. However, it made the egg that was shining brightly with golden light, go back to its original appearance. At a glance, the egg resembled a light golden-colored and slightly oversized ostrich egg. Apart from that, there was nothing peculiar about it.<br>That said, Chu Feng knew very well that it was very possible that some extraordinary being was contained inside the egg.<br>"Little fellow, although I do not know what you are, I hope that you are the obedient kind. Otherwise, do not blame me for being impolite with you."<br>Chu Feng looked at the egg and smiled. Then, he put itinto his Cosmos Sack.<br>Even though Chu Feng knew that if there was a living creature inside the egg, if it turned out to be an extraordinary existence, he was still prepared to subdue it.<br>So what if it would be difficult to handle?<br>Chu Feng was determined to challenge this sort of unknown danger.<br>If he did not even possess this bit of courage and confidence, how would he be able to make progress, how would he be able to challenge the great power that had entrapped his mother?<br>After putting the egg away, Chu Feng soared into the sky and flew out of the gate of light.<br>Soon, Chu Feng returned to where he was previously.<br>When Chu Feng turned back, he discovered that the gate of light emitted by the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram was dissipating, and the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram itself also lost its ability to float in midair, and was drifting to the ground.<br>Chu Feng caught the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram. Upon doing so, he discovered that the mysterious picture on the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram had disappeared, and was replaced with a complete picture.<br>It was a picture of a monstrous beast.<br>That monstrous beast had a dragon head, deer antlers, a pair of lion's eyes, a tiger's back, a bear&rsquo;s waist, and scales that covered its body. It was very majestic and awe-inspiring. It was like a ruler among beasts.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng's eyes shone. He felt both joyous and worried.<br>The reason for that was because the picture on the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram was not a monstrous beast. Instead, it was a divine beast that possessed boundless power, the Qilin.<br>Even though the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram did not possess the slightest bit of special aura anymore, and was akin to a normal picture scroll, the divine beast Qilin that was shown on the picture scroll caused Chu Feng to make a guess.<br>"Could it be that this is foretelling that sealed egg to be a divine beast?"<br>The reason why Chu Feng was feeling joy was because if what was inside the egg was a divine beast, a Qilin, it would provide enormous assistance should he be able to tame it.<br>After all, divine beasts possessed inestimable power. They were kings among beasts. Likely, from the human race, only exceptionally powerful martial cultivators would be able to contend against them.<br>The reason why Chu Feng was worried was because if it was really a Qilin, it would be very difficult to tame it. The difficulty would even be a bit too extreme.<br>That said, Chu Feng was feeling more joy than worry. After all, if the foretelling was real, it would definitely be an enormous opportunity for him.<br>After all, divine beasts were legendary beings. People had never seen an actual divine beast before. At the very least, a frightening thing like a divine beast had never appeared in the Ancestral Martial Starfield before.<br>If news of a possible divine beast was spread, even if no one could tell with certainty that what was inside the egg was a divine beast, it would likely still cause a rain of blood in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Upon seeing the Divine Beast Qilin's picture on the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram, Chu Feng began feeling with even greater certainty that the journey had not been in vain. Although there was great danger, it remained an extremely rare opportunity.<br>Chu Feng placed the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram into his Cosmos Sack. Then, he carefully observed his sealing formation. After discovering that it was completely intact, he nodded in satisfaction.<br>"This girl is quite well-behaved," Seeing that his spirit formation was completely undamaged, Chu Feng knew that Wuma Shengjie did not attempt to peek at him.<br>With a wave of his sleeve, the spirit formation dissipated. Chu Feng saw that Wuma Shengjie was still standing before the entrance and maintaining the spirit formation.<br>Merely, differently from when Chu Feng left, the Liangqiu Sisters were no longer simply shouting. Instead, they had begun to attack the spirit formation entrance.<br>Furthermore, they were not trying to breach it using their world spirit techniques. Instead, they were directly attacking it using their martial power.<br>"You've finally come out. Otherwise... I'd become unable to stop them," Wuma Shengjie said.<br>"Why didn't you ask what I went to do?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"It's none of my concern. Thus, why would I ask?" Wuma Shengjie said.<br>"I like your personality," Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>"You actually like someone who wants to kill you?" Wuma Shengjie looked to Chu Feng with a dumbfounded expression.<br>Chu Feng felt very helpless upon being looked at in such a manner. In a slightly embarrassed manner, he asked, "You couldn't possibly be planning to attack me right after returning the favor, right?"<br>"This request of yours is nothing more than lifting one's hand. It cannot cancel out the favor of you saving me."<br>"I still owe you a favor," Wuma Shengjie said.<br>Chu Feng was startled upon hearing that. Then, a faint smile appeared on his face. He thought to himself, 'This girl is quite interesting.'<br>Then, Chu Feng removed the spirit formation entrance. Seeing that both Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie were fine, the Liangqiu Sisters and the others all heaved a sigh of relief.<br>Using the justification that something unexpected had happened, Chu Feng made an excuse as to why they were slow in coming out. The Liangqiu Sisters and the others accepted Chu Feng's excuse as true, and did not question them further.<br>The reason for that was because, compared to the safety of Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie, they were more concerned about another matter -- the sealed stele.<br>At that moment, a change had occurred to the stele. Cracks had appeared on it. Faint light was being emitted from the cracks. It was as if some sort of treasure was hidden within the stele. Merely... the crowd was unable to tell what it was.<br>Most importantly, no matter how they looked at it, they felt that it was a sign of the spirit formation not being completely unsealed.<br>"Chu Feng, could it be that you two failed to solve the spirit formation in the allocated time, and caused this stele's seal to not be completely unsealed?" Someone asked Chu Feng. There was a trace of blame in that person's words.<br>"It seems that I did not explain myself properly. Although we came out a bit late, we solved that spirit formation at the allocated time," Chu Feng said.<br>"In that case, why is that stele not completely unsealed?" The crowd asked in unison.<br>"Who said that the stele is not completely unsealed?" Chu Feng asked.<br></p></div>
