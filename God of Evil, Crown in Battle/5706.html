        <h1>Chapter 5706: Heaven-devouring Qilin</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were horrified, including the Saint-tier elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heart-rending cries were more than enough to show that something was devouring the saint beast&rsquo;s life force, soul, and bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What are you doing, Chu Feng? Stop it right away!&rdquo; the elders roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The saint beast&rsquo;s egg was too valuable. They would be punished if anything happens to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why do you think I&rsquo;d listen to you when I came here to do this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be smug, Chu Feng! You&rsquo;ll pay the price for your arrogance,&rdquo; the Saint-tier elder roared through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be smug about. I&rsquo;m just crippling a couple of eggs. Are you getting angry because you feel powerless? You have lived for tens of thousands of years, but you still can&rsquo;t control your emotions? Why don&rsquo;t you pay a visit to Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span>? He has some experience in dealing with anger issues, so maybe he can share some insights with you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Saint-tier elder&rsquo;s temple veins popped out, as his killing intent flurried in the cavern, but it was for naught. He couldn&rsquo;t hurt Chu Feng at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other eggs quickly fell silent. Soon, even the saint beast stopped moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders were at a loss for words. Their minds went blank, as they didn&rsquo;t know what to do in this situation. The Saint-tier elder glared at Chu Feng and bellowed, &ldquo;Chu Feng, I swear I&rsquo;ll hunt you down and kill you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Again, you&rsquo;re saying unnecessary words. As if your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion isn&rsquo;t already doing that. Speaking of which&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to the other elders. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t wish to die, I suggest you leave the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion as soon as possible, lest you get caught in the crossfire when I make a move.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng formed a hand seal, and a surge of teleportation energy shrouded him. Just like that, he disappeared before their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The teleportation energy Chu Feng had used was from the World Spiritist Immortal King, and he was brought back to the place with two teleportation formations. He immediately reached into his Cosmos Sack and took out an item.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Heaven-devouring </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Egg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had confirmed that the Heaven-devouring </span><span>Qilin</span><span> was the culprit who had devoured the life force and bloodlines of the saint beast and the others. Cracks had appeared on the surface of its egg, indicating that it was on the verge of hatching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng had obtained this egg by coincidence. He later encountered a black dragon in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm, who told him that inside the egg was a Heaven-devouring </span><span>Qilin</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had also told him that the being in the egg would not pale too far in comparison to a god beast even if it wasn&rsquo;t one, and it would be highly beneficial if he used it well. He even constructed a formation on the egg to ensure that the being inside wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hurt him after it hatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The egg was finally going to hatch, and Chu Feng was looking forward to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more cracks appeared on the surface of the Heaven-devouring </span><span>Qilin</span><span> egg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what kind of existence you are,&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Heaven-devouring </span><span>Qilin</span><span> egg finally opened, and a blinding golden light suffused the area. An intense killing aura poured out from within, seeking to take Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uwa</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The killing intent receded before it could get to Chu Feng, and a cry of agony followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golden light soon faded, revealing what was within the egg. The being who had emerged from the egg was bound by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s formation. This formation was the one that had stopped it from killing Chu Feng and was punishing it for its attempt to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t surprised by the presence of the formation. What surprised him more was the appearance of the being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a golden animal that was around 60 centimeters in length. It was covered in fish scales, and there were two short whiskers above its nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But other than </span><span>that</span><span>&hellip; its nose resembled a pig, its ears resembled a pig, its feet resembled a pig, its tail resembled a pig, and even its body resembled a pig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;It was a goddamned pig!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why was a pig incubated instead?&rdquo; Chu Feng blurted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being tortured by the formation, the pig rose to his feet and glared at Chu Feng, saying, &ldquo;Who are you calling a pig? How dare you insult me?!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t bother explaining it. With a flick of his wrist, he manifested a mirror with his spirit power and placed it in front of the pig, saying, &ldquo;What the&hellip; How did I turn out like this?!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pig was horrified. It couldn&rsquo;t accept its appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;If you have seen a pig before, you should agree that there&rsquo;s no difference between you and a pig,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Silence! I forbid you from saying that of me. Also&hellip; can you stop the formation? Don&rsquo;t you feel terrible torturing me like that?&rdquo; the pig asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why should I stop the formation just because you ask for it? You tried to kill me earlier,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That formation was from Chu Feng&rsquo;s master, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. He was previously unable to sense much of it, but he was better able to perceive it now that the pig had been incubated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn&rsquo;t activate this formation on his own volition. It would be triggered on his own accord when certain conditions were fulfilled. Once it was triggered, he could choose whether to stop it or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense that the pig in front of him was formidable, and its earlier killing intent was not just for show. He might have just lost his life to it if not for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s formation. Besides, the pig was bound to be a formidable pig after it had devoured a saint beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist could restrain such a formidable pig showed just how powerful he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Kill you? There must be a misunderstanding somewhere. I had no intention to do so.&rdquo; The pig feigned innocence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; the pig asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Admit that you&rsquo;re wrong and say that you won&rsquo;t do it again. Do that, and I&rsquo;ll consider giving you another chance,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What a joke! How can a lofty existence like me admit my mistake before a mere human brat?&rdquo; the pig sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You can slowly wait for the formation to die down then,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he sat down on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pig immediately kneeled on the ground. It raised its two front paws up high as it said, &ldquo;Grandfather, I was wrong.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was dumbfounded. He didn&rsquo;t expect the pig to change its attitude that quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll give you another chance.&rdquo; Chu Feng formed a hand seal and dispelled the restraining formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a flash of golden light as soon as the formation was dispelled. The pig was trying to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Aiyo!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pig plummeted to the ground right away. The formation had been triggered once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were two functions to the formation. One was to stop the pig from attacking Chu Feng, and the other was to stop the pig from getting too far away from Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Stop it, stop it! I won&rsquo;t do it anymore!&rdquo; the pig shrieked in even greater agony than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The backlash from the formation was much worse this time around, to the point where it was forced to roll around the ground. This was where the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s ingenuity showed. The formation was constructed in a way where it grew stronger the more times it was invoked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chu Feng had no intention of stopping the formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;First you try to kill me, then you attempt to escape. You&rsquo;re a restless one. You&rsquo;ll think that I&rsquo;m a pushover if I don&rsquo;t punish you a little,&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I was wrong, I was wrong! You little luna&hellip; I mean, grandfather Chu! Please, spare this Little Piggy!&rdquo; the pig squealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng paid it no heed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pig&rsquo;s beady eyes rolled around the place in a dilemma, but it quickly made up its mind and exclaimed, &ldquo;Let me go, and I&rsquo;ll help you raise your cultivation!&rdquo;</span></p></div>
