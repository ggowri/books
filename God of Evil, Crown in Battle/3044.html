        <div> - Abyss Elf Clan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>"Quickly, get up," however, right after that old man kneeled before him, Chu Youyuan immediately helped him up.<br>"Rest assured, Chu Feng is a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan. No one shall wrongly accuse him. This old man will get justice for him," Chu Youyuan said.<br>"This lowly one believes in Milord."<br>"In that case, this lowly one will leave now. I will definitely keep what has happened here today confidential," that old man bowed respectfully to Chu Youyuan. Then, he turned around and prepared to leave.<br>"Wait," right at that moment, Chu Youyuan waved his sleeve, and took out an Immortal Armament from his Cosmos Sack. With a gentle flick of his finger, that Immortal Armament floated over to the old man.<br>"This is your reward for being so considerate," Chu Youyuan said.<br>"Milord, this lowly one was most definitely not trying to flatter you by saying nor did I say all this in hopes of being rewarded. This lowly one truly believes that a genius like Lord Chu Feng should be protected by our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Even if that isn't the case, he shouldn't be deliberately harmed by the people of our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm."<br>"Milord, farewell," surprisingly, that old man firmly refused Chu Youyuan's reward.<br>One should know that he was only a rank two True Immortal. To him, an Immortal Armament should be a priceless treasure.<br>However, after traveling for only a short distance, that old man suddenly turned around, clasped his fist and said to Chu Feng, "Lord Chu Feng, you must definitely take care of yourself. Our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm's future will all depend on you."<br>After he finished saying those words, that old man soared into the sky.<br>As he watched the old man leave, Chu Feng felt moved.<br>They were completely unrelated. In fact, he had never seen that old man before. Never did Chu Feng imagine that there would truly be someone who would speak up for him without seeking anything in return.<br>"If only our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm had more people like him, we would not have degenerated to our current state," compared to Chu Feng's feeling of being moved, Chu Youyuan let out a deep sigh.<br>"Chu Feng, what's your plan now?" Chu Youyuan asked Chu Feng.<br>"Milord, what do you have in mind? I will follow your arrangements," Chu Feng said to Chu Youyuan.<br>"I know that you want to return to the Chu Heavenly Clan immediately and retrieve justice from them. However, Chu Feng, that is actually not something to be impatient over. The reason for that is because increasing your cultivation is the most important thing for you."<br>"Even though you are the fully deserving number one person of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm's younger generation right now, even though you do not have to prove yourself, when compared to the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, you will still have to increase your cultivation quite a bit," Chu Youyuan said.<br>"Milord, in that case, what do you have in mind?" Chu Feng asked.<br>Chu Feng knew very well that he would have to rely on Chu Youyuan if he wanted to retrieve justice from those people of the Chu Heavenly Clan. If he were to return by himself, he would not even have a chance to speak. Furthermore, even if he did speak, no one would believe him.<br>Chu Feng knew very well how powerful the Chu Heavenly Clan was in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>They were truly capable of inverting black and white, right and wrong.<br>Thus, even if Chu Feng urgently wanted vengeance, he still had to wait for Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s approval.<br>Moreover, judging from Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s tone, it seemed that what he had decided upon was beneficial for Chu Feng. As such, Chu Feng would naturally listen to him.<br>&ldquo;This old man heard the conversation between you, Mingchao and Xunyi from earlier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If this old man&rsquo;s guess is right, the ravine that Mingchao and Xunyi entered should be the Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi all revealed curious expressions upon hearing those words.<br>After all, merely from the Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s tone, they were able to tell that the Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground should be a very remarkable place.<br>Afterwards, Chu Youyuan began to explain the Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground to Chu Feng and the others.<br>Long long before the Chu Heavenly Clan arrived at the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, there was a power by the name of the Abyss Elf Clan in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>This Abyss Elf Clan was very powerful. Not only did they rule the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, but they even threatened the status of the Starfield Master Realm.<br>To put it simply, the Abyss Elf Clan had nearly become the overlords of the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Even though they did not become the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the Abyss Elf Clan was deemed to be a power on par with the Starfield Master Realm.<br>The Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm of that time was truly unboundedly impressive. Not only were the other Upper Realms filled with reverence and respect toward the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, but even the Starfall Master Realm was filled with fear of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>That time was most definitely the most impressive time for the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>Even the Chu Heavenly Clan that succeeded the Abyss Elf Clan did not gain the deterrence power of the Abyss Elf Clan when they ruled over the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>One day, the Abyss Elf Clan suddenly disappeared. No one knew why they suddenly disappeared.<br>In a single night, the Abyss Elf Clan and the Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground that they lived in completely disappeared.<br>Since that day, the overlord of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm changed hands. Unfortunately, the new overlord of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was simply incomparable to the Abyss Elf Clan.<br>Because of that, the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm received a sudden and devastating decline in status in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>In fact, the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm that had originally stood at the apex became one of the weakest Upper Realms in the entire Starfall Master Realm.<br>Later on, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Old Ancestor, Chu Yetianhong, led the Chu Heavenly Clan and arrived at the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm from the Lower Realms and campaigned all the way to becoming the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s overlord. It was only after that that the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s status gradually began to rise.<br>However, even during the most outstanding and strongest period of the Chu Heavenly Clan, the status of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was still inferior to the time when it was ruled by the Abyss Elf Clan.<br>To this day, the disappearance of the Abyss Elf Clan remains a mystery of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>However, after their disappearance, there would always be people that encountered the Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Grounds appearing in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>Merely, the Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Grounds became an ever-moving existence. Furthermore, even if one were to encounter it, they would not be able to enter it, as there was an invisible barrier that blocked them from entering it.<br>The Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground was still as beautiful as before. Unfortunately, there was no sign of the Abyss Elf Clan at all.<br>Because of that, the Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground became a mystery like the vanished Abyss Elf Clan.<br>&ldquo;Milord, are you certain that ravine is the wandering Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>After hearing what Chu Youyuan said, Chu Feng was filled with curiosity toward that Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground. With how powerful the Abyss Elf Clan was, why would they suddenly disappear out of the blue?<br>The Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground was likely the key to that mystery.<br><br><br></p></div>
