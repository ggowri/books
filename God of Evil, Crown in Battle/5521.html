        <h1>Chapter 5521: Revealing His Strength</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Even those who were already inside the formation core stopped their cultivation and kept their eyes on the situation, not wanting to miss the fight between Chu Feng and Feng Tiansheng. While they had witnessed Chu Feng&rsquo;s incredible means many times before, they had never seen him in a fight before.</span><br><span>They were curious to know how strong they were.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, since I have already let them go, you better not think about escaping from here. That would be too shameless of you,&rdquo; Feng Tiansheng replied.</span><br><span>In truth, he was feeling a bit nervous. The barrier he had used to trap Chu Feng proved to be useless, and he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to lay his hands on Long Shanshan and the others anymore now that they had entered the formation core. He no longer had any leverage over Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Should Chu Feng decide to flee at this juncture, there was no way he could catch up with him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t. I am a man of my word,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good to hear. Let me have a taste of your strength then.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Feng Tiansheng exerted his bloodline power, raising his cultivation from rank four Half-God level to rank six Half-God level. He whipped out an Exalted Armament halberd and charged at Chu Feng. He wasn&rsquo;t underestimating Chu Feng as an opponent anymore.</span><br><span>In response, Chu Feng took a step forward and responded with a swing of the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword.</span><br><span>Klang!</span><br><span>Sparks flew when the halberd and the sword collided.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo; Feng Tiansheng was taken aback.</span><br><span>His Exalted Armament was a halberd, which dished out powerful blows due to its heavy weight. Considering that Chu Feng was equipped with a mere sword, he should have the upper hand in a direct clash.</span><br><span>Yet, the outcome of the collision was that Chu Feng firmly stood his ground, whereas he was sent flying thousands of meters away. Even his hands felt extremely numb </span><span>from the rebound.</span><br><span>He, a member of the Totem Phoenix Clan, one of the strongest monstrous beast races, had gotten overpowered by a human! How was that possible?!</span><br><span>&ldquo;You are not too bad for someone who looks that frail. Interesting. I wouldn&rsquo;t have expected anything less.&rdquo; Feng Tiansheng suddenly burst into laughter as he charged at Chu Feng once more with the halberd in hand.</span><br><span>Hu hu hu hu!</span><br><span>He began spinning his halberd, creating countless afterimages in its wake. This was a special halberd skill he had practiced for quite some time.</span><br><span>Yet, his laughter was quickly cut short. Even with his special halberd skill, he still wasn&rsquo;t able to put up a fight against Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!</span><br><span>With just a few slashes, Chu Feng unraveled Feng Tiansheng&rsquo;s halberd skill and shoved his sword against the latter&rsquo;s face.</span><br><span>Feng Tiansheng panicked. It was already too late by the time he understood what was going on. He thought that he would lose his life here, as Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword was powerful enough to slice his head into two.</span><br><span>Pah!</span><br><span>The next moment, Feng Tiansheng was sent flying with a stinging pain on his face. He instinctively raised his hand to touch his face, but he couldn&rsquo;t feel any blood. Instead, there was a red print on his cheek.</span><br><span>Chu Feng had opted to smack his face with the sword&rsquo;s body instead of slicing him in half.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s injured!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;That was fast!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng is actually that powerful!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen were taken aback. None of them had been able to discern the details of the battle, as both Chu Feng and Feng Tiansheng were much stronger than them, and it was only when the two of them stopped moving that they could tell what had happened.</span><br><span>With a glance, they noticed that Chu Feng was unharmed, whereas Feng Tiansheng had a swollen sword imprint on his face. It was immediately apparent to them that Feng Tiansheng had been outdone in the earlier clash.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng is actually that strong?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Phoenix Clansmen were taken aback too, as Feng Tiansheng was known to be the strongest prodigy to have ever appeared in their clan. It was one thing for him to be outdone by Long Chengyu, but who could have thought that he would be beaten by Chu Feng too?</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you humiliating me?&rdquo; Feng Tiansheng furiously glared at Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The match has already concluded. Would you have preferred me to decapitate you instead?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>Feng Tiansheng was rendered speechless, but the burning humiliation he felt prompted him to make another move.</span><br><span>Whoosh!</span><br><span>With a piercing cry, a gigantic, golden phoenix swooped down on Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Feng Tiansheng had employed a martial skill this time around, knowing that it was unlikely for him to overpower Chu Feng in close combat.</span><br><span>Chu Feng casually waved his sword, releasing a huge blast of sword qi that easily sliced the golden phoenix into two. He then waved his sword once more, unleashing another wave of sword qi toward Feng Tiansheng.</span><br><span>Feng Tiansheng hurriedly used his movement skill to dodge the attack.</span><br><span>However, Chu Feng simply continued to casually unleash wave after wave of sword qi that chased after him and even sealed off his routes of escape.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Martial skills can be used in such a way too?&rdquo; Feng Tiansheng exclaimed with a frown.</span><br><span>He could tell that those weren&rsquo;t normal sword qi, or else it wouldn&rsquo;t have sliced through his martial skill that easily. Knowing that he was cornered, he gathered his martial power and manifested a golden barrier.</span><br><span>This was a defensive martial skill that was of a higher tier than Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword qi. He was confident that he could withstand Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack with this.</span><br><span>Bam!</span><br><span>Yet, the golden barrier shattered upon contact with the sword qi, and the remaining momentum of the sword qi continued rushing at him. He was knocked down from the sky into the earth, and the impact made him spew blood. However, he hurriedly raised his head to look at the sky, where he was standing before.</span><br><span>There, he saw an intense golden light mixed with a deep growl. What had struck his barrier wasn&rsquo;t just a sword qi but another martial skill.</span><br><span>&ldquo;A martial skill in a martial skill. How despicable, Chu Feng,&rdquo; Feng Tiansheng growled.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you being a sore loser now, Feng Tiansheng? It is young hero Chu Feng&rsquo;s capability that he can conceal a martial skill inside another. Don&rsquo;t you feel embarrassed for putting him down for that?&rdquo; Long Shanshan scoffed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How shameless!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have willingly admitted defeat if I encountered such an opponent. You only have your foolishness to blame for falling for young hero Chu Feng&rsquo;s trick. How thick-skinned must you be to blame your opponent for tricking you?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen chirped in as well.</span></p></div>
