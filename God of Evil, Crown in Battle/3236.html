        <h1>Chapter 3235</h1>
        <div> - Frantic Plunder<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I refuse to believe this!&rdquo; Linghu Lun shouted. Then he flipped his palm, and a silver spear appeared in his hand.<br>The silver spear was five meters long. Its entire body was covered in runes and symbols.<br>As the runes and symbols on the silver spear rotated, the surrounding space started trembling.<br>The Immortal-level Martial Power hidden within heaven and earth was being controlled by the rotation of the silver spear.<br>That silver spear was an Immortal Armament, an actual Immortal Armament.<br>With that Immortal Armament in hand, Linghu Lun&rsquo;s aura immediately grew explosively.<br>At that moment, Linghu Lun&rsquo;s battle power was absolutely not that of a mere rank one Martial Immortal.<br>However, this was still not the end. Lightning began to surge toward Linghu Lun&rsquo;s forehead. Then, a character &lsquo;Heaven&rsquo; composed of lightning appeared on his forehead.<br>After the character &lsquo;Heaven&rsquo; appeared, Linghu Lun&rsquo;s cultivation also increased from rank one Martial Immortal to rank two Martial Immortal.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, prepare to die!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>With a snarl, Linghu Lun brandished the silver spear in his hand.<br>Silver light began to flicker repeatedly as countless silver crescents began to bombard the flames.<br>However, when the silver crescent blade rays entered the flames, there was no change to the flames at all. It was like rivers flowing into a great ocean.<br>Linghu Lun&rsquo;s attack was actually engulfed by the flames.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?!&rdquo;<br>Linghu Lun was once again gobsmacked upon witnessing that scene.<br>While his failure in breaching the flames from Chu Feng&rsquo;s Fire Qilin Armor was pardonable earlier, it was absolutely inexcusable now.<br>After all, Linghu Lun had unleashed both his Heavenly Bloodline power and his Immortal Armament. Furthermore, the attack he had used earlier was a powerful Immortal Technique.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that I will have to tolerate the flames.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Linghu Lun clenched his teeth, and a determined expression flashed across his eyes. He had made a decision.<br>He had decided to enter the sea of flames again. Although the oppressive sensation of being engulfed by the flames was very painful, it seemed that the only way for him to enter the flames and take care of Chu Feng would be by enduring that sort of oppressive sensation.<br>As such, after Linghu Lun made his decision, he immediately set off. He turned into a ray of light and, like an extremely fast meteor, shot down from the sky and toward the flames.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>When Linghu Lun entered the flames, it was as if he had entered an enormous wave. He lost his ability to move about, and could only allow himself to drift with the wave of surging flames.<br>Not long afterward, Linghu Lun was pushed out of the flames by the wave.<br>&ldquo;I am&hellip; actually unable to enter it?!&rdquo;<br>Linghu Lun was stupefied. His was tongue-tied with shock. He simply did not dare to believe what had just happened.<br>Earlier, he was inside the flames. Yet now, he was unable to even enter the flames.<br>&ldquo;Linghu Lun, don&rsquo;t bother wasting your energy. Since I, Chu Feng, dared to come here, it means that I possess absolute confidence in being able to confront you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I am unable to cause you harm or kill you with the power of this Fire Qilin Armor, you&rsquo;re also unable to do anything to me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, you&rsquo;re unable to do anything, and will only be able to look on helplessly as I, Chu Feng, plunder the Symbols of Light from your Linghu Heavenly Clansmen,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng! You dare?!!!&rdquo; Linghu Lun threatened angrily.<br>&ldquo;You can see if I, Chu Feng, dare or not,&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed. Then his body shifted, and he arrived beside a Linghu Heavenly Clansman.<br>Chu Feng extended his finger and pressed it on that Linghu Heavenly Clansman&rsquo;s Symbol of Light.<br>&ldquo;Eeeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, that Linghu Heavenly Clansman let out an incomparably miserable scream of pain.<br>At the same time as that happened, that Linghu Heavenly Clansman&rsquo;s Symbol of Light was stripped by Chu Feng and assimilated into his own Symbol of Light.<br>Although Chu Feng&rsquo;s Symbol of Light did not appear to have much of a change, everyone knew that Chu Feng had plundered that Linghu Heavenly Clansman&rsquo;s Symbol of Light.<br>The reason for that was because not only did that Linghu Heavenly Clansman&rsquo;s Symbol of Light disappear, but he soon disappeared from the Holy Spirit Formation of Light too.<br>He had been expelled from the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re truly courting death!!!&rdquo; Linghu Lun shouted with incomparable anger. Even heaven and earth started to tremble violently.<br>He was truly enraged. He did not expect that Chu Feng would really dare to attack the people from their Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>Provocation. Chu Feng&rsquo;s action was absolutely one of provocation toward their Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>However, his anger and his snarl were completely useless against Chu Feng.<br>Not only was Chu Feng not afraid of him, but he instead started to laugh mockingly. Then, he began to frantically plunder the Symbols of Light from the other Linghu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>Whilst all this was happening, even though Linghu Lun was gnashing his teeth furiously and wanted to rip Chu Feng to shreds, he was powerless to do anything, and could only listen to his clansmen&rsquo;s miserable screams.<br>He could only look on helplessly as everything unfolded before him, as Chu Feng stripped away his clansmen&rsquo;s Symbols of Light and expelled them from the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>That said, the ones that were suffering the most were the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen that has had their mobility restricted by Chu Feng, but had yet to have their Symbols of Light stripped away.<br>Even though their Symbol of Light was still on their foreheads, they knew very well that they would not be able to escape from a crisis.<br>Earlier, they were ridiculing Chu Feng.<br>Yet now, they were akin to lambs before the butcher. They could only wait for Chu Feng to take care of them.<br>What they were feeling at that moment was truly painful.<br>&hellip;...<br>Meanwhile, on the plaza in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s Overlord Region. All the people present were completely stunned.<br>Originally, the people from the four regions still felt pained and displeased, whilst the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were immersed in joy.<br>However, suddenly, a Linghu Heavenly Clansman appeared at the place where the newcomers were being treated.<br>Before the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen could approach that person to ask him what had happened, more Linghu Heavenly Clansmen began to appear.<br>One after another, they continued to appear there. Furthermore, every one of them was showing the same sort of symptoms. Like the newcomers from the four regions that had appeared before them, they too were extremely weak, and seemed to be on the verge of dying.<br>Seeing them like that, the crowd knew without even asking that they must&rsquo;ve have had their Symbols of Light plundered by someone, and were then expelled from the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>Merely, who would dare to plunder the Symbols of Light from the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen?<br>Furthermore, some person or people had plundered the Symbols of Light from so many Linghu Heavenly Clansmen at once. Even now, there were still more Linghu Heavenly Clansmen appearing in the plaza.<br>It was as if all of the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s newcomers were going to be eliminated!!! [1. I&rsquo;m assuming there&rsquo;s more than 5 entrance keys for the Linghu Heavenly Clan. Otherwise, there should only be 3 people that appeared on the plaza.]<br>No, it wasn&rsquo;t as if... It had actually happened.<br>After another person appeared in the plaza, of the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s newcomers that had entered the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, only Linghu Lun was still inside. Everyone else had been banished by the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>&ldquo;Insolence! Who is it?! Who dared to do this?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly who is it that dared to do this?!!!!&rdquo;<br>Finally, Linghu Tiemian, who was sitting in the plaza&rsquo;s master seat, was finally unable to contain his anger, and began to question them angrily.<br>Merely, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen that were expelled from the Holy Spirit Formation of Light were simply too weak at that moment. They did not even possess the strength to speak.<br>However, from the movement of their lips, the crowd were able to make out the name they were trying to say.<br>Chu Feng. The words that the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were trying to say was precisely Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually him?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That reckless bastard, he&rsquo;s clearly setting himself out to oppose our Linghu Heavenly Clan! He is truly courting death! Truly courting death!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, many of the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen present started to gnash their teeth furiously. The people that were originally still sitting had all stood up.<br>The people present were all able to sense their anger.<br>Their anger was very intense, frighteningly intense.<br>The crowd believed that if Chu Feng were to appear before them, those Linghu Heavenly Clansmen would definitely tear him to pieces.<br></p></div>
