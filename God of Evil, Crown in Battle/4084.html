        <h1>Chapter 4083</h1>
        <div> - Shocking Everyone<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was only upon closer inspection that they realized what they thought to be corpses were all people from their Constellation Immortal Isle.<br>Even though the appearance of those people were all appalling and tragic, none of them were dead. Instead, they were all on the verge of death, and barely alive.<br>The person dragging those people was a young man.<br>From his appearance and the sensation he gave off, one could tell that he was a person of the younger generation from a single glance.<br>Even though they knew that this person was only a person of the younger generation, many people from the Constellation Immortal Isle still stepped back repeatedly in fear.<br>The reason for their enormous fear was because of the fact that the first person Chu Feng was dragging along was their Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Supreme Elder.<br>That Supreme Elder of theirs was someone with a rank three Utmost Exalted-level cultivation, and strength ranked second in their Constellation Immortal Isle, inferior to only their Isle Master.<br>&ldquo;Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You truly possess some nerve,&rdquo; the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master spoke.<br>Among all the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle, he was the only person that was not afraid of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You were planning to eradicate my Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Since you dare to attack my Constellation Immortal Isle, you&rsquo;ve committed a capital offense. Not a single one of your clansmen can think of escaping alive,&rdquo; said the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>&ldquo;I originally only planned to teach them a lesson.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, since you&rsquo;ve said it like that, I&rsquo;ve changed my mind.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Remember, you are the cause of their deaths.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng waved his arm, and a shining sword of light appeared in his hand.<br>The sword thrust into the ground before sweeping across.<br>&ldquo;Clamor~~~&rdquo;<br>The soil overturned with flesh and blood mingled together.<br>With the slash of the sword, a giant ditch ten thousand meters long appeared beneath Chu Feng&rsquo;s feet.<br>Blood was flowing into that deep ditch.<br>Dead. The people from the Constellation Immortal Isle that had barely been alive were all killed by Chu Feng.<br>Seeing this scene, the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle were all astonished. In fact, even the people from the Purple Star Hall turned ashen with shock.<br>Due to the fact that the abnormal sign had covered the sky, what happened in the Purple Star Variance Realm was fully visible to everyone outside.<br>All of them witnessed Chu Feng defeating the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Supreme Elder.<br>They also all witnessed how Chu Feng had obliterated all those experts from the Constellation Immortal Isle.<br>What the blue-gowned old man said was no rumor at all. It was all true.<br>A genius had truly appeared in the Chu Heavenly Clan. That genius was so powerful that he did not even place rank three Utmost Exalteds in his eyes.<br>However, the blue-gowned old man had not told them that the genius was not only exceptionally talented, but also a malignant star of a person, a fiend of a man, a demon in the flesh!<br>Witnessing Chu Feng killing all those experts, many people from the Constellation Immortal Isle were scared speechless.<br>However, there was a single person among them who was enormously furious. His eyes turned deep red, and his fists clenched tightly.<br>That person was the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you realize what it means to offend someone that you cannot afford to offend!&rdquo; The Constellation Immortal Isle Master shouted furiously.<br>Enraged, his oppressive might began to wreak havoc.<br>Like a giant wave, his rank four Utmost Exalted-level oppressive might rushed towards Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng chuckled coldly. Light radiated all around.<br>From invisible to visible.<br>Two streams of power collided in midair.<br>The powerful energy ripples terrified the experts of the Constellation Immortal Isle, and caused them to flee and take shelter.<br>But, while the experts were able to flee, the surrounding scenic features could not.<br>Because of that, everywhere the energy ripples touched, everything was destroyed.<br>Even space itself crumbled and sunk into primal chaos.<br>Looking from the outside through the abnormal sign, people could see how extensive the destruction was.<br>&ldquo;World spirit power is really able to contend against a martial cultivator&rsquo;s oppressive might?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists actually possess a battle power this strong?&rdquo;<br>When they witnessed with their very eyes how Chu Feng took on the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master with his spirit power without being disadvantaged, the experts from the older generation all felt a sense of disbelief, whereas the experts from the younger generation were all dumbstruck.<br>After all, they all had the impression that Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists only possessed battle power on par with a rank one Utmost Exalted.<br>But, it was only on par, as the majority of the Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists would not be a match for rank one Utmost Exalted-level experts.<br>Yet, Chu Feng was actually fighting a rank four Utmost Exalted expert as a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, and was not at a disadvantage at all.<br>Furthermore, his opponent was the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master, who had defeated the six other rank four Utmost Exalted-level overlords!<br>One should know that the majority of the people from the Purple Star Hall looked down on the ten overlord powers.<br>The only exception to the case would be the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>Even the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had publicly commended the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>Reportedly, the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had wanted to make the Constellation Immortal Isle into their subsidiary power.<br>There were also rumors that stated that the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master was unmatched among people of the same battle power.<br>But, Chu Feng was actually facing an existence that powerful without losing. It was only natural that the crowd would be astonished.<br>Regardless of whether Chu Feng could defeat the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master or not, merely the battle power he displayed was enough to subdue many people.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, loud sounds exploded repeatedly. Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power became increasingly fierce. It was actually suppressing the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master&rsquo;s oppressive might and moving toward him.<br>Seeing that, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master narrowed his brows. From his fierce expression, one could tell that he was giving his all to urge his oppressive might to take on Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power.<br>But, even though he was giving it his all, he was still unable to contend against the great surges of boundless spirit power. He could only look on helplessly as the boundless spirit power slowly pressed onto him.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the situation was bad, a curved blade appeared in the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master&rsquo;s hand.<br>That was an Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>Once the Incomplete Exalted Armament appeared, his battle power increased enormously.<br>His invisible oppressive might counterattacked. It rushed toward Chu Feng intent on pushing him back.<br>&ldquo;Humph~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng let out a cold snort.<br>A loud boom was heard from within him.<br>Then, people could see even more boundless spirit power erupting from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body in an unending stream.<br>The spirit power released at that moment was even more sacred, even brighter, and even more powerful than before.<br>Under the pressure from the renewed spirit power, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master&rsquo;s oppressive might was once again being suppressed.<br>Seeing that, the people from the younger generation were completely stunned.<br>Even the experts of the older generation were stupefied.<br>Even though it was merely a confrontation of oppressive mights and not an actual showdown, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master, who was renowned for his powerful battle power, was actually being suppressed.<br>In fact, he was still being suppressed even after he took out an Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>Because of this, the crowd looked at Chu Feng as if he simply wasn't a human.<br>After all, no human should be able to possess such terrifying battle power.<br>The scene of the confrontation was not only witnessed by the people outside.<br>Within the depths of the Purple Star Hall, inside the grand palace hall, the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master and Supreme Elder Pang Youyang also witnessed the abnormal sign.<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master.&rdquo;<br>Pang Youyang had a shocked look. He turned his gaze to his Lord Hall Master.<br>The Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master also had a look of surprise.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that an exceptional member of the younger generation has appeared in that unremarkable Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master sighed.<br></p></div>
