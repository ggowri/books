        <h1>Chapter 3663</h1>
        <div> - World Spirit&rsquo;s Weapon<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Do you know why I was in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm?&rdquo; Yin Zhuanghong asked.<br>&ldquo;I am actually very curious about that too. Might you be willing to explain it to me?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I was interested in the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak. However, it was only after I arrived in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm that I learned that the Ice Summit&rsquo;s Nine Dragons Saint Cloak had already been retrieved by someone,&rdquo; said Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;That is truly a coincidence,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled in embarrassment.<br>&ldquo;Actually, I&rsquo;ve come to this place with a purpose in mind too,&rdquo; said Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very direct.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, what is your purpose?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;The Divine Armament Villa&rsquo;s Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda,&rdquo; said Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking about that red pagoda?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>The Divine Armament Villa was very large, and had many buildings of all kinds. However, there was a single building that was particularly eye-catching.<br>It was a pagoda deep inside the Divine Armament Villa. That pagoda was fully red. Not only did it appear very strange, but there were also several thousand levels in it.<br>That red tower pierced through the clouds and deep into the sky. It was very magnificent to look at.<br>Furthermore, it was protected by a very powerful world spirit formation. Not even Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes were able to see through it. Thus, not even he knew what the situation inside the pagoda was like.<br>That said, the red pagoda was somewhat similar to what Yin Zhuanghong had described.<br>That was the reason why Chu Feng suspected that the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda was that red pagoda.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Yin Zhuanghong nodded.<br>&ldquo;What is it that you want to obtain from that pagoda?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t possibly be thinking of taking away that entire pagoda, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile.<br>Yin Zhuanghong was simply too cold of a person. Being together with her, even the atmosphere became extremely heavy. Chu Feng was not fond of this sort of atmosphere. Thus, he subconsciously started to joke around.<br>&ldquo;You will also be interested in what&rsquo;s inside that pagoda,&rdquo; said Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;Oh? Why don&rsquo;t you tell me what might be inside then.&rdquo; Said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Weapons for world spirits,&rdquo; said Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;Weapons for world spirits?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed upon hearing those words. He who had sat down already immediately stood up.<br>Sure enough, Yin Zhuanghong had hit the mark.<br>If it were something else, Chu Feng might not be interested in it. However, after hearing that it was related to world spirits, Chu Feng was immediately interested, extremely interested.<br>Chu Feng had known Her Lady Queen for so long. Her Lady Queen had truly helped him enormously. He had always felt that he owed her.<br>Because of that, he had always wanted to give her something to make up to her and express his gratitude toward her.<br>Unfortunately, he had been unable to find anything suitable.<br>Yet, he had suddenly learned that there were actually weapons that world spirits could use. Naturally, Chu Feng wanted to obtain one for Her Lady Queen.<br>&ldquo;There are a lot of different weapons for world spirits. However, what&rsquo;s inside the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda are no ordinary weapons.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those weapons were created especially for world spirits by an Ancient Era&rsquo;s master world spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps those weapons would not be of much use should the world spirits return to their spirit world, but they&rsquo;re extremely helpful to world spirits when they&rsquo;re in our cultivator world,&rdquo; Yin Zhanghong continued.<br>Yin Zhuanghong was someone that talked very little, someone who was habitually silent.<br>Chu Feng knew that she was saying so much because she wanted to pique his interest.<br>She was acting that way because she wanted his assistance.<br>&ldquo;I am indeed interested. However, since they are possessions of the Divine Armament Villa, we couldn&rsquo;t possibly steal them, no?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Those weapons do not belong to the Divine Armament Villa. They have only been left in the Divine Armament Villa by a friend of the Villa Master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That person has stated that if anyone is able to enter the pagoda, they can choose and take the weapons in the pagoda at will,&rdquo; said Yin Zhaunghong.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s such a thing? In that case, why didn&rsquo;t you proceed to do that directly? Why are you mentioning this matter to me?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my first time here. If I am to mention it directly, it would be rather presumptuous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Seeing that your relationship with senior Shoujian is quite good, I decided to mention this matter to you. Besides, I also need your help,&rdquo; said Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;In that case, I&rsquo;ll go and ask about this matter later. If it is truly as you stated, I am willing to cooperate with you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had agreed to it, she did not say anything anymore, but only nodded.<br>Then, Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong left the resting hall and returned to the main palace hall.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, what did you and Miss Yin de?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You actually even used a spirit formation to conceal yourselves. Could it be&hellip; he he, the two of you did something shameful?&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng had returned, Kong Tianhui ran over to Chu Feng with a mischievous look on his face.<br>&ldquo;Watch your mouth!&rdquo;<br>Right after Kong Tianhui finished saying those words, an ice-cold gaze was cast toward him. It was Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s gaze had turned particularly cold. Even though she was beautiful like a celestial fairy, her gaze frightened even someone as shameless as Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;Miss Yin, do you want me to help you teach him a lesson?&rdquo;<br>Nangong Yifan arrived beside Yin Zhuanghong. Compared to Yin Zhuanghong, Nangong Yifan had a very clear look of anger on his face.<br>He seemed like he would immediately tear Kong Tianhui apart should Yin Zhuanghong give the order.<br>&ldquo;No need.&rdquo;<br>However, even though Nangong Yifan was showing such concern for her, Yin Zhuanghong responded very coldly. She left only two words and then returned to her chair and sat back down.<br>She did not choose to leave. Naturally, she was waiting for Chu Feng to mention the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda to Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;Kong Tianhui, curb that mouth of yours properly. Otherwise, no one will be able to save you.&rdquo;<br>Even though Yin Zhuanghong had responded very coldly to him, Nangong Yifan still fiercely threatened Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;No one will be able to save me? My brother Chu Feng is standing right over there. Try touching me if you can.&rdquo;<br>Kong Tianhui went over to Chu Feng and looked to Nangong Yifan provocatively.<br>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; Nangong Yifan wanted to say something. However, after taking a glance at Chu Feng, he let out a cold snort, waved his sleeve and walked away.<br>Chu Feng had already left an enormous trauma upon him. Unless absolutely certain of victory, no matter how conceited he might be, he would not dare to challenge him again.<br>&ldquo;Brother Kong, what you said earlier was indeed excessive,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked at Kong Tianhui with slight rebuke.<br>&ldquo;I had no malice at all. It&rsquo;s merely a joke,&rdquo; Kong Tianhui spoke with grievance.<br>&ldquo;How could you casually joke around with a woman&rsquo;s reputation and integrity? If someone is to joke like that about me, would you be able to tolerate it?&rdquo; Kong Ci ran over and criticized her older brother.<br>&ldquo;Your little sister is more sensible than you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I got it. I was wrong,&rdquo; Kong Tianhui finally realized his mistake. After saying those words, he deliberately ran over to Yin Zhuanghong and apologized to her.<br>Even though Yin Zhuanghong did not bother to pay attention to him, Kong Tianhui was filled with sincerity in his apology. The only thing he didn&rsquo;t do was kneel down to her.<br>In the end, it was the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations that felt annoyed with Kong Tianhui and drove him away. Otherwise, he would likely have continued to bother Yin Zhuanghong until she finally forgave him.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng arrived before Lord Shoujian.<br>Chu Feng did not wish to beat around the bush. Thus, he directly asked Lord Shoujian about the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.<br>&ldquo;The Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, why did you suddenly mention this matter? You couldn&rsquo;t possibly be interested in that Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda, right?&rdquo;<br>Lord Shoujian was not only surprised after hearing what Chu Feng said, but the smile on his face also became stern. There was also a trace of resistance in his eyes as he looked at Chu Feng.<br>This caused Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart to tense up. He was able to tell that Lord Shoujian seemed to not want him to enter the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.<br></p></div>
