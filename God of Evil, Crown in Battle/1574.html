        <div> - King Monstrous Dragon Beast<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Tantai Xue,&rdquo; Upon seeing Tantai Xue, Chu Feng immediately started waving to her. He knew that she was searching for him.<br>Sure enough, after Tantai Xue saw Chu Feng, she immediately got down from the platform she was standing on and rapidly arrived before Chu Feng.<br>However, another group of people came along with Tantai Xue. That group of people were from the Nangong Imperial Clan. As for the person who led them, he was someone Chu Feng had seen before, that rank three Half Martial Emperor-level young man, the person who Nangong Baihe called Nangong Ya.<br>Chu Feng knew that this Nangong Ya could be said to be someone from the Nangong Imperial Clan&rsquo;s younger generation who possessed a very good relationship with Nangong Baihe and her sister. He had shown great consideration for them. Thus, Chu Feng&rsquo;s impression of this Nangong Ya was very good.<br>&ldquo;This is truly fate. Never would I have expected that you all would be together. Furthermore, it seems that you&rsquo;ve been getting along real well,&rdquo; Nangong Ya&rsquo;s perception was quite sharp. With a single glance, he determined that Chu Feng had been getting along well with Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to be expected. In our journey here, Chu Feng saved us twice. He is the savior, the great benefactor, of us sisters,&rdquo; Nangong Baihe said with a beaming smile. When mentioning Chu Feng, she had an expression of gratefulness.<br>To her, the current Chu Feng was not a bad example at all. Instead, he was an absolutely great example.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s truly a coincidence. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Miss Tantai Xue here, we too would have been unable to arrive here without a hitch. Speaking of it, you all are truly benefactors to our Nangong Imperial Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, please receive my Nangong Ya&rsquo;s respect,&rdquo; As Nangong Ya spoke, he bowed to Chu Feng to express his thanks.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Brother Chu Feng, for your immense assistance,&rdquo; Following that, the other members of the Nangong Imperial Clan also bowed to Chu Feng. However, Chu Feng was able to tell that, other than Nangong Ya, none of them did so with sincerity.<br>&ldquo;Brother Nangong, you are truly too courteous. What I have done is only something that I should do. If you&rsquo;re my friend, then you shouldn&rsquo;t regard me as an outsider and do something this courteous.&rdquo; Chu Feng had gone to help Nangong Ya up.<br>&ldquo;Yoh, two misses, you are all finally here. To see that you&rsquo;re fine, we are truly relieved,&rdquo; Right at this moment, a group of people suddenly appeared. After seeing this group of people, Nangong Baihe was immediately enraged. She started to gnash her teeth in anger. The reason for that was because they were people from the Three Thousand Monastery.<br>Nangong Baihe had held a stomach-full of anger. At this moment, she finally had the chance to let it out. She immediately walked over to them, extended her arms and began to &lsquo;pow, pow, pow,&rsquo; give ruthless slaps to the faces of the people from the Three Thousand Monastery.<br>The slaps were not enough. After slapping them, she began to punch and kick them. As for the people from the Three Thousand Monastery, not only did they not dare to fight back, they did not even dare to dodge Nangong Baihe&rsquo;s beatings. Thus, they were beaten extremely miserably.<br>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; sis Baihe, what are you doing? Exactly what happened?&rdquo; Nangong Ya was unable to continue watching Nangong Baihe beat those people anymore. Thus, he grabbed her and stopped her.<br>&ldquo;What happened? That Three Thousand Monastery&rsquo;s monastery head, for the sake of escaping with his life, bound me and my lil&rsquo; sis and then threw us toward the sea monster. He tried to use our lives to stall for time for him to escape. If it weren&rsquo;t for Chu Feng&rsquo;s timely arrival, my lil&rsquo; sis and I would have already died,&rdquo; Nangong Baihe said with immense anger.<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the people from the Three Thousand Monastery were all stunned. One by one, their complexions turned ash gray, and their expressions became dejected. They all felt that a great catastrophe was going to befall them. No matter what, they never would have expected that their monastery head would do such a thing. Wasn&rsquo;t this equivalent to having them become his scapegoats?<br>&ldquo;What about that Three Thousand Monastery&rsquo;s monastery head? Where is he?&rdquo; Hearing what Nangong Baihe said, Nangong Ya also had an angry expression.<br>&ldquo;Escaped,&rdquo; Nangong Baihe said.<br>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; sis Baihe, lil&rsquo; sis Moli, I have let you two suffer. However, please rest assured, I will definitely not let that Three Thousand Monastery&rsquo;s monastery head escape. Even if I have to turn the entire Holy Land of Martialism over, I will still find him and make him pay the price.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it remains that one should not involve third parties when settling disputes. What happened was caused by the Three Thousand Monastery&rsquo;s monastery head and does not have much of a direct relationship with the members of the Three Thousand Monastery. Thus, there is no need to make things difficult for them,&rdquo; Nangong Ya urged.<br>&ldquo;Humph~~~&rdquo; Nangong Baihe was not someone who was completely unreasonable. Naturally, she understood that too. Merely, her bellyful of anger was something that could only be released on the people from the Three Thousand Monastery. Now that she had already beaten them up, she would naturally not continue to make things difficult for them.<br>At this time when Nangong Baihe was making a ruckus, Chu Feng asked Tantai Xue, &ldquo;Miss Tantai, where is senior Hong Qiang? Has he not arrived yet? Or will he not be able to get here?&rdquo;<br>That was because he had managed to sense that even though a lot of people had gathered on this island, there were no Martial Emperor-level experts or peak Half Martial Emperor-level experts among them. In fact, there was barely anyone with the cultivation of a rank five Half Martial Emperor, much less above.<br>However, in reality, there were countless experts who traveled through this place. Yet, none of those experts were present. Chu Feng felt that this was definitely not a coincidence.<br>&ldquo;Your guess is correct. Senior Hong Qiang and the others have been separated from us by that storm. They simply do not have the chance to come to this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I think the reason why the Weaponry Refinement Immortal has done that is because he wanted to prevent senior Hong Qiang and the others from protecting us,&rdquo; Tantai Xue said.<br>&ldquo;As long as he&rsquo;s fine, everything&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;He should be fine. The numerous trials set up by the Weaponry Refinement Immortal are there to test us. His intention was not to deliberately kill us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. I managed to attain some news that should be of interest to you,&rdquo; Tantai Xue said.<br>&ldquo;What news?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;As far as I know, there have been a lot of members of the younger generation from all around the Holy Land of Martialism that have come here. However, among them, the ones with actual strength are the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan and the people from the Beitang Imperial Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;None of the younger generation from the Dongfang Imperial Clan and the Ximen Imperial Clan have come to participate in this Weaponry Bestowment Assembly. According to Nangong Ya, the Dongfang Imperial Clan and the Ximen Imperial Clan recently got along real well with a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist called Compass Immortal. It seems that the two Imperial Clans both wished to invite that Compass Immortal to become their nominal elder and world spiritist adviser.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, it happens that this Compass Immortal had past conflicts with Weaponry Refinement Immortal. That is why neither of those two Imperial Clans came to participate in this Weaponry Bestowment Assembly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Other than those two Imperial Clans, there are members of the younger generation from another power who have come here. Even though they are not humans, their strength is also nothing to look down upon. You must pay attention to them. It would be best that we do not enter conflict with them,&rdquo; Tantai Xue said.<br>&ldquo;Not humans? Are they the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves or Monstrous Beasts?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>The Holy Land of Martialism had a lot of powers. Other than humans, there were Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves and Monstrous Beasts.<br>There were a lot of different races of Monstrous Beasts. Many of the powerful Monstrous Beast races were stronger than the Nine Powers. The strongest among them were even on par with the Four Great Imperial Clans.<br>In short, the Monstrous Beasts were existences that one could not ignore in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>However, regardless of how powerful the Monstrous Beast races might be, they would likely be weaker than the mysterious race that came from the Ancient Era, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves. The Elf Kingdom was a supreme existence in the Holy Land of Martialism. Likely, even the strongest human powers, the Three Palaces, would not be willing to provoke them.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves. They&rsquo;re Monstrous Beasts, King Monstrous Dragon Beasts,&rdquo; Tantai Xue said.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re actually the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts? This is too coincidental. Never would I have expected to be able to see them this quickly,&rdquo; If it were other Monstrous Beasts, Chu Feng would not be that interested. However, the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts were a race of Monstrous Beasts that Chu Feng was very interested in.<br>Back then, in the Cyanwood Domain, there had been Monstrous Dragon Beasts causing chaos and devastation in a region. The Cyanwood Mountain had dispatched disciples to wipe them out. At that time, Chu Feng had fought against the Monstrous Dragon Beasts and killed them.<br>However, it remained that Monstrous Dragon Beasts were only Monstrous Dragon Beasts. They were different from the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts. The King Monstrous Dragon Beasts could be said to be the strongest dragon beast race in the entire Holy Land of Martialism. Reportedly, the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts possessed bloodlines from actual dragons.<br>What were dragons? They were the legendary mythological beasts; a myth that no longer existed.<br>Thus, the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts that possessed the bloodlines of dragons were a very powerful Monstrous Beast race. Even if they were inferior to the human race&rsquo;s Four Great Imperial Clans, they would likely not be much weaker. Essentially, their strength was greater than even the Nine Powers.<br>They were one of the most powerful Monstrous Beast races in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>Chu Feng had always wanted to have a look at what the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts were like. Never would he have expected that the opportunity to do so would present itself so quickly.<br></p></div>
