        <h1>Chapter 3333</h1>
        <div> - Main Clan and Branch Clan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Chu Feng, rather than being on guard against me, an outsider, it&rsquo;s better that you be on guard against your Chu Heavenly Clansmen."<br>"Admittedly, it&rsquo;s due to the might of the Starfield Master Realm that your father was expelled from your Chu Heavenly Clan. However, those scum of your Chu Heavenly Clan also contributed greatly to that decision."<br>"Those people have enormous hatred for both your grandfather and your father. Naturally, they will not have any familial affection for you either. You must be careful, for they are not upright people. Instead, they&rsquo;re truly vile and nasty characters," Li Ruochu said.<br>"Thank you for your warning," Chu Feng revealed a grateful smile at Li Ruochu.<br>A person from an enemy power, a person capable of easily killing him, had not only especially sought him out, but she also did not make things difficult for him, and instead said those sorts of words to him. Naturally, she possessed good intentions.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to stand on courtesy, it would do if you treat my sister well.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Farewell, little friend.&rdquo;<br>Li Ruochu smiled profoundly. Then, her body shifted, and her clothes fluttered about. Before Chu Feng could even notice the direction that she flew toward, she had disappeared completely.<br>However, at that moment, Chu Feng was felt a sense of awkwardness.<br>Li Ruochu&rsquo;s &lsquo;treat my sister well&rsquo; seemed to possess hidden implications.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that girl Li Yue&rsquo;er has an interest in me, and mentioned it to her older sister?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That shouldn&rsquo;t be the case, no? After all, that doesn&rsquo;t seem like something that girl would do,&rdquo; Chu Feng began to ponder.<br>&ldquo;That girl Li Ruochu seemed to possess a very favorable impression of you,&rdquo; suddenly, a voice was heard. Turning around, Chu Feng saw the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Seeing them, Chu Feng came to a realization.<br>Evidently, the two of them had been there for some time now. The reason why they did not show up the entire time was likely because they were afraid that Li Ruochu would harm Chu Feng. Thus, they were secretly protecting him.<br>As for the matter regarding the Moon Immortal, Chu Feng felt that the two of them should not have noticed it. After all, no matter how powerful they might be, the disparity between their strength and the Moon Immortal&rsquo;s strength was simply too vast.<br>&ldquo;I pay my respects to seniors,&rdquo; before the two approached Chu Feng, Chu Feng hurriedly greeted them respectfully.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s no need for you to stand on ceremony,&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief waved his hand whilst smiling after descending before Chu Feng. Then, he said, &ldquo;That girl Li Ruochu rarely treats people in such a friendly manner. It would appear that young friend Chu Feng has quite a deep relationship with her little sister Li Yue&rsquo;er.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, you&rsquo;re misunderstanding things. Li Yue&rsquo;er and I are merely friends,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Haha, in that case, it would mean that it&rsquo;s Li Ruochu who misunderstood your relationship. That said, young friend Chu Feng, those two women who have snatched away the treasure from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant, their relationship with you shouldn&rsquo;t only be that of friends, no?&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>Sure enough, he was very curious about the identity of Su Rou and Su Mei.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I can inform you about this matter. However, this junior also has a matter that I wish to consult senior about. Might senior be willing to inform me about that matter truthfully?&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist. Although he spoke with a courteous tone, he had emphasized the word &lsquo;truthfully.&rsquo;<br>At that moment, the gazes of the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief both changed. They had realized that what Chu Feng wanted to ask should not be something simple.<br>However, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did not hesitate, and directly said, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, ask away.&rdquo;<br>He actually wanted to find out whether or not he could truthfully answer the question that Chu Feng wanted to ask him. If possible, he would naturally be willing to exchange answers with him. If it was impossible, he could think of another method.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what happened to Wuma Shengjie?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Hearing that question, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s gaze turned serious. Evidently, he did not anticipate that Chu Feng would ask that question.<br>He was hesitating. Judging from his expression, he should be making a very difficult decision in his heart.<br>Suddenly, he sighed. Then, he said, &ldquo;Actually, this matter is not some sort of secret either. Merely, as the clan chief of the Wuma Heavenly Clan, this matter is something that I&rsquo;m too embarrassed to mention.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that this junior was too impulsive. Senior, if it&rsquo;s inconvenient for you to inform me, it&rsquo;s fine to not say anything,&rdquo; seeing the difficult expression of the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Chu Feng clasped his fist apologetically.<br>The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief sighed again, then waved his hand. He said, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s fine for me to inform you about it. There are two factions in our Wuma Heavenly Clan in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. You should know about that, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Regarding this&hellip; my apologies senior, this junior has only returned to the Ancestral Martial Starfield recently, and does not know about that,&rdquo; Chu Feng said embarrassedly.<br>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine. You merely need to know that there are two Wuma Heavenly Clans in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. One is the main clan whereas, the other is a branch clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for us, we are the main clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the branch clan, they have become one of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s Ten Great Heavenly Clans many years ago. As for their strength&hellip; they surpass that of the Li Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although the two clans have been separated for many years, it remains that our roots are the same Wuma Heavenly Clan. As such, we inevitably possess some relationship with one another and would, back then, occasionally hold inter-clan interactions with one another.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back then, Shengjie was still young, and had injured the daughter of the branch clan&rsquo;s clan chief. The branch clan became furious with what Shengjie did, and demanded an explanation. In the end, Shengjie and Shengjie&rsquo;s parents became the sacrifices of our main clan.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief revealed a very ashamed expression.<br>Then, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief began to tell Chu Feng about what had happened back then in detail.<br>After learning what had happened, even Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression turned incomparably stern.<br>Wuma Shengjie, what that girl had experienced was truly capable of making one feel extremely distressed and pained.<br></p></div>
