        <div> - Imminent Battle<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;If that item is that dangerous, why did that Old Ancestor only seal it, and not destroy it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For that Old Ancestor to seal it in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, wouldn&rsquo;t it be placing a hidden danger in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Our Old Ancestor said that item possessed a former relationship with it. Thus, Old Ancestor was unwilling to kill it, and decided to seal it instead.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the issue of that item becoming a calamity, our then Abbot also asked Old Ancestor about it. As for the response from Old Ancestor...&rdquo; After saying those words, Grandmaster Pocket sighed helplessly. It seemed that he had a hidden trouble that was hard to mention.<br>&ldquo;What was the response?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Our Old Ancestor said &lsquo;How is the death of others related to me?&rsquo;&rdquo; Grandmaster Pocket said. When he said those words, he had an ashamed expression.<br>Although that old cat was not a Buddhist monk, he was still related to the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple, and was respected as their Old Ancestor. However, the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple needed to be righteous and benevolent. Thus, it would involuntarily make them feel embarrassed to mention their Old Ancestor.<br>After hearing what Grandmaster Pocket said, Chu Feng felt that actually made sense. Chu Feng did not feel surprise when he heard that that old cat had said something like that. On the contrary, it seemed like something it would say.<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng inquired more about that old cat. However, it seemed that Grandmaster Pocket only possessed limited knowledge.<br>To put it briefly, that old cat had merely conveniently decided to help the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple one time. With its cunning nature, it would naturally not say much about itself to the people from the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple. Thus, Chu Feng believed that Grandmaster Pocket was not lying to him, and that the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple knew very little about the old cat.<br>Although Chu Feng was unable to obtain any useful information regarding the old cat, Chu Feng did not return to rest in the war chariot.<br>Instead, he chose a secluded place to set up a concealment formation to conceal himself.<br>Chu Feng did that with the intention of creating a quiet place so that he could carefully read the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart.<br>After all, if Chu Feng were to completely grasp this book, he would be able to make progress in his cultivation.<br>Furthermore, this sort of progress would not be a one or two time thing. Instead, it could be said that it would be a lifelong benefit.<br>That said, even though Chu Feng had obtained the complete version of the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart, it would still take him some time in order to completely comprehend it.<br>Before Chu Feng could completely comprehend the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart, the allied army arrived at Chen Heavenly City.<br>This Chen Heavenly City was a city ruled by a Chen Heavenly Clan.<br>The Chen Heavenly Clan also possessed a Heavenly Bloodline. Although they were far inferior to the Kong Heavenly Clan and the Zhou Heavenly Clan, they were a tier two power in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. As for their strength, they were on par with the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall. However, they were more famous and prestigious than the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall.<br>This Chen Heavenly Clan could be said to be a very reputed power in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>However, from the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s invitations, as well as the information obtained from Old Demon Rakshasa, this Chen Heavenly Clan was actually the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s headquarters.<br>At this moment, not only was the Chen Heavenly City&rsquo;s entrance gates tightly closed, but its defensive formation was also active. Apart from the people inside, no one was capable of entering it.<br>Several hundreds of thousands of people were already gathered outside Chen Heavenly City.<br>They were all people that came here upon receiving the invitation. However, the Chen Heavenly City&rsquo;s gates had been closed the entire time. As such, they were simply unable to enter.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that the words &lsquo;Infant Soul Sect&rsquo; were written on the large banners outside the Chen Heavenly Clan, the crowd would truly think that they&rsquo;d been duped.<br>&ldquo;Look! Who are those people?! They&rsquo;re actually this imposing and grand!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens! It&rsquo;s Hero City, the Immortal Sword School and the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why would they send forth this many people? Could it be&hellip; that they have also received the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s invitation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is truly unfathomable! Exactly what is the origin of that Infant Soul Sect? It actually managed to invite even those huge monsters.&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing the grand and majestic allied army, the people gathered here all burst into an uproar.<br>After all, to them, Hero City, the Immortal Sword School and the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple were the current rulers of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>It would not be an exaggeration at all to say that these three powers were akin to gods in the eyes of many people. They held extremely high status in the hearts of the people in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected that the Chen Heavenly Clan was actually an accomplice to the Infant Soul Sect. They have truly hidden themselves well.&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s banners, many people revealed expressions of hatred and disgust.<br>If they hadn&rsquo;t witnessed it themselves, they would truly feel this to be unimaginable.<br>The reason for that was because the Chen Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Chen Heavenly City was not a desolate place.<br>Inside this Chen Heavenly City was an auction house. That auction house was famous throughout the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>Thus, not to mention the others from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, even many people from the allied army have been to that auction house.<br>However, never had they ever discovered any connection between the Chen Heavenly Clan and the Infant Soul Sect. From this, it could be seen that the Chen Heavenly Clan had kept things hidden extremely well.<br>&ldquo;Infant Soul Sect, I shall see exactly what you all plan to do this time around.<br>At the moment when the allied army was gasping at the fact that there was actually a massive connection between the Chen Heavenly Clan and the Infant Soul Sect, Ying Mingchao walked out from his war chariot and arrived at the forefront of the allied army.<br>&ldquo;Look! It&rsquo;s Ying Mingchao, it&rsquo;s Lord Ying Mingchao!&rdquo;<br>After Ying Mingchao appeared, the crowd gathered outside the Chen Heavenly Clan burst into an uproar once again.<br>They never expected that even a grand character like Ying Mingchao would show up here.<br>After all, Ying Mingchao was the publicly accepted number one expert of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, I will make a long story short. This Infant Soul Sect is not any righteous or good-natured power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Infant Soul Sect is a demonic sect that has existed in our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm for many years. They train in demonic technique using the bodies of infants as their cultivation resource. Over the many years, they have slaughtered countless innocent lives. I believe everyone has heard about this matter before. Some among you all might have even suffered at their hands,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao spoke with a thunder-like voice.<br>&ldquo;What?! This Infant Soul Sect is actually the rumored evil power that uses the bodies of infants as their cultivation resource?&rdquo;<br>After hearing what Ying Mingchao said, many people came to a sudden realization. After that, they revealed frightened expressions on their faces.<br>Although they had never heard of the Infant Soul Sect by name, they had heard of that evil power.<br>After all, the Infant Soul Sect had conducted all sorts of evil. They had massacred countless infants and cities. Furthermore, they would oftentimes not bother to even get rid of the corpses. This made it so that many people had witnessed the devastating scenes they left in their wake.<br>Thus, while many people had never heard of the Infant Soul Sect, many among them had heard of the rumored evil power that specialized in killing infants.<br>&ldquo;So this Infant Soul Sect is actually that power. Yet they actually dared to send us invitations? Could it be&hellip; that they&rsquo;re planning to kill us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Ying Mingchao, this Infant Soul Sect has done countless evils. Their crimes cannot be forgiven. You must definitely uphold justice for us.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, the crowd present all began to shout for a crusade against the Infant Soul Sect.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, rest assured. Today, our Hero City has come here together with the Immortal Sword School, the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple and others precisely to eliminate the malignant tumor that is the Infant Soul Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, perhaps everyone does not know about it. However, the power of the Infant Soul Sect must not be looked down upon. Once the battle begins, casualties will be inevitable. Thus, everyone, it would be best to withdraw from here so as to not be implicated by the battle,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>Once Ying Mingchao said those words, the people that were gathered outside the Chen Heavenly City immediately started to soar into the sky. Like a group of frightened birds, they began to fly away in all directions.<br>Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s words did not sound like a joke. Furthermore, the allied army looked extremely ferocious.<br>As such, they felt that what Ying Mingchao said was the truth. As these people were all people that cherished their lives, they would naturally escape immediately after finding out about the dangers. None of them wanted to be implicated by the battle and lose their lives.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after the crowd all scattered away from Chen Heavenly City, the spirit formation around Chen Heavenly City actually opened.<br>At this moment, everyone from the allied army and the people that were fleeing all turned their gazes toward Chen Heavenly City.<br>They all wanted to see exactly what sort of capability this notorious Infant Soul Sect possessed for them to dare to openly invite all these people here.<br><br></p></div>
