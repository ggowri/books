        <div> - Homicidal Maniac<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell that while Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren were not Exalted-level experts, they were peak Martial Immortals. Indeed, it would be safer to have the two of them protect him.<br>Most importantly, if Chu Feng refused, Chu Xuanzhengfa would likely disregard his own proper business and insist on personally accompanying Chu Feng.<br>That was something that Chu Feng did not wish to see happen. Chu Feng did not wish to delay others because of himself, especially those that were good to him.<br>Even though it was their first meeting. Chu Feng was able to tell that Chu Xuanzhengfa seemed to care greatly for him.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Xingde, Xingren, the two of you take this with you. You must definitely bring Chu Feng back to our clan safely. Otherwise, you two will be punished,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa tossed a golden object to Chu Xingde.<br>Seeing that golden object, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>That golden object was only half a palm in size. It was a little golden house.<br>However, Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that it should be a treasure, a life-protection treasure.<br>&ldquo;Lord Vice Hall master, if something is to happen to Chu Feng, the two of us will return to you with our heads,&rdquo; Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren said in unison after Chu Xingde accepted the golden house.<br>[1. He&rsquo;s saying that they will apologize by beheading themselves for their failure.]<br>Afterwards, Chu Xuanzhengfa led the Law Enforcement Hall&rsquo;s army and returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>As for Chu Feng, he began to proceed toward the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain with Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren accompanying him.<br>Chu Feng was planning to find Song Xi. After leaving the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain, Chu Feng had been worrying about Song Xi the entire time. He did not know if Song Xi had managed to safely obtain the inheritance. However, Chu Feng would definitely not disregard him.<br>On the way, Chu Xingde said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, Lord Vice Hall Master is truly good to you. Our big brother Xingtian is tasked with protecting Lord Vice Hall Master&rsquo;s daughter. However, not even he has ever been given this Goldenshield House. Yet, Lord Vice Hall Master gave this Goldenshield House to us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly how powerful is that Goldenshield House?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say it like this. Although Xingren and I are both rank nine Martial Immortals, and are incapable of contending against Exalted-level experts, not even Yuwen Huazang would be able to injure us should we encounter him with this Goldenshield House in our possession,&rdquo; Chu Xingde said.<br>Chu Feng did not say anything else after hearing those words. However, he firmly remembered the kindness Chu Xuanzhengfa had shown him.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa was truly different from the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>He did not possess the arrogance the others did from the bottom of their heart. Instead, at their first meeting, he gave Chu Feng the feeling of a relative.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell that the amiable and gentle gaze which with Chu Xuanzhengfa looked to him was most definitely not a pretense. He was truly considering Chu Feng his relative.<br>Although Chu Feng did not know why Chu Xuanzhengfa placed such high importance on him, Chu Feng firmly remembered this kindness from Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>At the same time, Chu Feng&rsquo;s impression of Chu Lingxi also grew more favorable. It was all because her father was Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>After traveling for some time, Chu Feng finally arrived at the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain.<br>However, upon reaching the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain, Chu Feng refused to have Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren accompany him. Chu Feng did not wish for them to find out about Song Xi&rsquo;s secret. Even though he knew that Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren were good men, he still would not expose Song Xi&rsquo;s secret to them.<br>Moreover, Chu Feng made Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren guarantee that they would not secretly follow him.<br>Originally, Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren refused Chu Feng&rsquo;s request. However, they were unable to make Chu Feng change his mind. In the end, they reached a compromise. Most importantly, the two of them actually really did not secretly follow Chu Feng into the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain. Instead, they stood outside the mountain to wait for Chu Feng.<br>The Primal Sea Sacred Mountain was still powerful. Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation had increased a lot, he still felt that enormous restrictive power upon entering the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain again.<br>Fortunately, Chu Feng still had the banners that would allow him to rapidly travel through the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain. Soon, Chu Feng arrived at the location where Song Xi had received the inheritance.<br>However, when Chu Feng entered that place again, he discovered that Song Xi was already gone.<br>Upon seeing that Song Xi was gone, Chu Feng&rsquo;s worry decreased greatly. At the very least, this meant that Song Xi was not in any fatal danger. He had most likely successfully obtained the inheritance.<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng left the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain and returned to Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren. The three of them began to proceed toward the direction of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>While traveling, Chu Xingren said to Chu Xingde, &ldquo;Second brother, how are the investigations of that matter coming along?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That matter?&rdquo; Chu Xingde asked.<br>&ldquo;The one about those people that died tragically,&rdquo; Chu Xingren said.<br>&ldquo;We have already narrowed the scope. Soon, we will be able to capture that demon. If we are to capture that demon, we must definitely make him pay the price,&rdquo; Chu Xingde said. As he said those words, he had an expression of hatred on his face.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. For the sake of his own cultivation, he killed so many innocent people. We must definitely punish him severely,&rdquo; Chu Xingren also spoke with hatred in his tone.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, is someone willfully slaughtering the innocent?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;Mn, tragedies have been happening frequently in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm recently. The people that died were all killed in an extremely cruel manner. Someone is most definitely training in some sort of demonic technique, and is using people&rsquo;s lives to increase their cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That demon is simply too cruel. He does not even spare children. The places he passes are simply left completely barren. Not even fowls or dogs were left alive,&rdquo; Chu Xingde said.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what happened? Seniors, can you tell this junior in detail?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a curious expression on his face.<br>Chu Xingde did not try to conceal this matter, and began to tell Chu Feng all that he knew.<br>When Chu Feng found out about everything, his heart tightened.<br>The reason he had asked about the details was because he had started to think about Song Xi.<br>After receiving the inheritance, two different outcomes were possible for Song Xi.<br>He would either come out unscathed from the inheritance, or he would become possessed by the devil, and turn into a homicidal maniac.<br>Could it be that the demon Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren spoke of was Song Xi?<br><br><br></p></div>
