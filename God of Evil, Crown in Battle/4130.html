        <div> - Testing Bloodline<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;That thing is related to Heavenly Bloodlines.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If my guess is correct, it should be for testing one&rsquo;s bloodline power,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you actually don&rsquo;t recognize that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You truly have a Heavenly Bloodline in vain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That thing is called a Bloodline Testing Stone. It&rsquo;s very similar to the Heavenly Lightning Steps, and is indeed used to test one&rsquo;s bloodline.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that Heavenly Bloodline possessors with peerless talent are capable of triggering nine-colored lightning.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, very few people are capable of accomplishing that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you should go and give it a try.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll be able to trigger the nine colored lightning,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Haha! What a joke!&rdquo;<br>However, right after Fumo Shaoyu&rsquo;s words left his mouth, mocking laugh was heard.<br>That laughter actually came from Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>&ldquo;Even with how outstandingly talented I, Zuoqiu Tiancheng, am, even though I&rsquo;ve trained in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, I was still only able to trigger eight colored lightning.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Someone like him wants to trigger nine colored lightning?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truly delusional,&rdquo; Zuoqiu Tiancheng spoke mockingly.<br>That fellow was extremely arrogant.<br>Even though he was already tied up, even though his face had been slapped beyond recognition by Fumo Shaoyu, Zuoqiu Tiancheng had never yielded, and had continued to threaten Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu.<br>And now, he was actually ridiculing Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You are truly shameless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Someone like you thinks you&rsquo;re capable of being compared to Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He was able to effortlessly restrict your movements,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er wasn't able to tolerate Zuoqiu Tiancheng anymore, and actually spoke to mock him.<br>&ldquo;Humph, an old fart that&rsquo;s cultivated for many years, what ability is that in bullying a person of the younger generation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, those with superb world spirit techniques are generally lacking talent in martial cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. I might as well tell you all this. This Bloodline Testing Stone of mine is something that only younger generations within a hundred years of age are capable of triggering.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;An old fart like him will not be able to trigger anything even if he sat on it.&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Tiancheng laughed even more mockingly, and became even more pleased with himself.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;<br>Hearing that, Chu Feng, who originally wasn't interested in the Bloodline Testing Stone, suddenly became interested.<br>He leapt forward, and landed firmly on it.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Chu Feng sat down on the testing stone, nine colored lightning soared out of the stone and into the sky.<br>The nine lightning bolts intertwined with one another. Their colors were all different. They were extremely dazzling.<br>They were&hellip; the nine-colored lightning!<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; how could this be?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that he&rsquo;s also a person of the younger generation?&rdquo;<br>Witnessing this sight, the arrogant Zuoqiu Tiancheng was immediately stunned.<br>Even though Chu Feng had easily defeated him, he did not feel any fear towards Chu Feng.<br>The reason for that was because he believed himself to be the strongest genius in the world.<br>To be able to so easily defeat him, he was certain that Chu Feng was a cultivator of the older generation, and definitely not someone of his generation.<br>However, he also knew that the Bloodline Testing Stone was incomplete.<br>Because of that, it had a restriction.<br>Only people of the younger generation were capable of using it.<br>The fact that Chu Feng had triggered nine colored lightning after sitting on the Bloodline Testing Stone signified two things.<br>One, Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent was extremely strong, much stronger than his own.<br>Two, Chu Feng was also a person of the younger generation like him.<br>A person of the younger generation possessing talent for martial cultivation above his own? That was something that he found very difficult to accept.<br>But, for that person of the younger generation to also be a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist who could easily defeat him using world spirit techniques? He found that even more difficult to accept.<br>Chu Feng had made Zuoqiu Tiancheng, this genius who had always been conceited, suddenly feel inferior.<br>His confidence of being superior to everyone took a massive blow.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my first time seeing someone who is able to trigger nine colored lightning.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truly the younger generations will surpass us in time.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a resounding voice exploded in the sky.<br>Looking up, Chu Feng, Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s expressions all changed enormously.<br>They saw two figures standing in the sky looking at them.<br>Those two people both carried the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s title plate on their waists.<br>Most importantly, among them was a middle-aged looking man with a head of white hair. He appeared to be very unfathomable. They were all able to tell that he was extremely powerful.<br>Upon seeing the two men, Zuoqiu Tiancheng shouted, &ldquo;Lord Father! Big brother! Save me!&rdquo;<br>The reason for that was because the two men that had arrived were his father, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, and his elder brother, Zuoqiu Daoyi.<br>&ldquo;Crap!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng immediately realized that the situation was bad the moment he heard Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s shout.<br>He knew that his father was the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Even though he knew that the situation was bad the moment he saw the man, he did not anticipate that he would be the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s strongest expert.<br>This meant that standing before them was a peak Utmost Exalted-level existence.<br>Facing an existence of that caliber, Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings were simply unable to even flee.<br>&ldquo;Daoyi, go and untie your brother first,&rdquo; said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Zuoqiu Daoyi immediately flew down and began to untie the spirit formation chains from Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>&ldquo;Father&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Immediately afterward, Zuoqiu Daoyi turned his gaze to the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>There was actually an appealing look in his eyes.<br>He was surprised to discover that, even with his strength, he was unable to remove the chains.<br>&ldquo;Father always told you two that there are always people stronger than yourselves in this world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the past, you two refused to believe me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now do you believe me?&rdquo;<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief first took an admiring glance at Chu Feng. Then, he raised his hand and pointed.<br>&ldquo;Paaa~~~&rdquo;<br>Even though it was only a point of his hand, the spirit formation chains that bound Zuoqiu Tiancheng immediately broke apart.<br>&ldquo;Lord Father, I don&rsquo;t know where these two bastards came from, but they not only tried to snatch my wife, they even gave me a beating. Lord Father, please uphold justice for me!&rdquo;<br>After being freed, Zuoqiu Tiancheng immediately arrived before his father.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>However, to his surprise, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief gave him a resounding slap to the face.<br>With that slap, Zuoqiu Tiancheng was completely stunned.<br>In fact, even Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings were bewildered.<br>What was going on?<br>Things seemed to be turning out different from what they were expecting?<br>They&rsquo;d heard that the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was someone who pampered his children.<br>Amongst his many children, the one he pampered the most was his son, Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>According to what Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu had done, they must&rsquo;ve most definitely committed a capital offense in the eyes of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Thus, why would the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief known for pampering his son not attack them, but instead give Zuoqiu Tiancheng a slap to the face?<br>&ldquo;Three young friends, I&rsquo;ve incurred ridicule from you all in how I&rsquo;ve failed to educate my son.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I can see that three young friends all possess outstanding talent. You must have extraordinary origins&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;May I know what young friends&rsquo; distinguished names are, and where you&rsquo;re from?&rdquo;<br>As the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke, he descended from the sky and walked over to Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings.<br>Not only that, he also had a smile on his face. His attitude was very good.<br></p></div>
