        <h1>Chapter 3816</h1>
        <div> - Wrongly Accused<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Brat, we can tolerate you trapping us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if you dare to rob us, you&rsquo;ll truly be courting death!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was really planning to rob, the eleven world spiritists all became extremely displeased.<br>&ldquo;Oh? So you don&rsquo;t want me to live? In that case, I can&rsquo;t allow you to live.&rdquo;<br>Although Chu Feng still had a faint smile on his face, that smile had turned cold. Furthermore, deep killing intent was being emitted from his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Brat.&rdquo;<br>Sensing Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing intent, the eleven world spiritists tensed up.<br>They were able to tell that Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing intent was no joke. That killing intent came from experience.<br>Merely from the killing intent he emitted, they were able to tell that there were a lot of people that had died at his hands.<br>The person standing before them was no ordinary member of the younger generation at all. Instead, he was more like a homicidal demon.<br>Thinking back on Chu Feng&rsquo;s behavior, they realized that he was someone who would dare to kill them.<br>If they were to continue to oppose him, they might really end up being killed by him.<br>&ldquo;Fine, fine, fine. Wealth and goods are mere worldly possessions.&rdquo;<br>They reached terms.<br>&ldquo;Very well, that&rsquo;s what you said.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t force you to say that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he extend his hand and sucked the eleven world spiritists&rsquo; Cosmos Sacks into his hand.<br>&ldquo;Brat, you&rsquo;re being too excessive here! There&rsquo;s more than the possessions we obtained from the World Spirit Mansion Gate in there!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had actually decided to act on his own and snatched away their entire Cosmos Sacks, the eleven voiced objections.<br>However, Chu Feng simply ignored them. Instead, he began to examine the contents of the eleven Cosmos Sacks.<br>However, after examining them, a look of disappointment appeared on his face.<br>Chu Feng had thought that since those eleven men were so despicable, shameless and extremely avaricious, they must possess a lot of treasures.<br>However, upon inspecting the Cosmos Sacks, he discovered that all the slightly precious items in their Cosmos Sacks were emitting the aura of the World Spirit Mansion Gate.<br>This meant that all of the precious treasures they possessed had just been obtained from the World Spirit Mansion Gate, and they were actually extremely poor.<br>&ldquo;How could you all be this poor?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brat, you&rsquo;re being too shameless here. You&rsquo;re robbing us, yet you&rsquo;re disappointed that we&rsquo;re poor?&rdquo; The eleven world spiritists felt furious and helpless from the bottom of their hearts. They didn&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or cry.<br>They&rsquo;d witnessed bandits before. However, never had they ever witnessed a bandit with such arrogance.<br>&ldquo;Bums, waste of my time.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng put away the eleven Cosmos Sacks. Then, he turned around with the intention to leave.<br>&ldquo;Brat, stay right there!&rdquo; The eleven world spiritists immediately shouted upon seeing that Chu Feng was planning to leave.<br>&ldquo;Need something?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Of course. Are you planning to walk away just like this?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say that you&rsquo;d spare us once we gave you the treasures we obtained?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only did we hand over all the treasures we obtained to you, but we&rsquo;ve also given you our own treasures. Why are you still not letting us go?&rdquo; asked the eleven world spiritists.<br>&ldquo;The World Spirit Mansion Gate is about to close anyways. You might as well stay here for a while longer,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brat, I&rsquo;d urge you to not be too excessive!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Leave yourself some room in case we meet again in the future. Do you really think that we&rsquo;re so easily bullied?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brat, if you are to leave like this, it&rsquo;ll be extremely insincere, extremely dishonest. How can one go back on their words like that?&rdquo; asked the eleven world spiritists.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s mouth spread into a wide smile. He said, &ldquo;I would never show sincerity to people like you.&rdquo;<br>Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, the eleven world spiritists started to gnash their teeth furiously and loudly curse Chu Feng out.<br>However, no matter how they cursed him, he paid no attention to them. Just like that, he walked away.<br>However, before Chu Feng could even exit the spirit formation gate, the ground underneath his feet started to tremble violently.<br>In the next instant, Chu Feng was able to sense an extremely powerful spirit power enveloping him.<br>Then, a spirit formation gate appeared before him. Chu Feng was then forcibly pulled into that spirit formation gate by the spirit power that enveloped him.<br>After passing through the spirit formation gate, Chu Feng discovered that he had exited the World Spirit Mansion Gate.<br>The entrance to the World Spirit Mansion Gate had disappeared. However, there were still a lot of people gathered in and outside the plaza.<br>Amongst were even people that Chu Feng was familiar with.<br>They were the people from the Watermirror Paradise. The Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster and his granddaughter Yang Shenshen were both present.<br>Those people seemed like they were waiting for him.<br>The instant Chu Feng appeared, everyone turned their gaze to him.<br>Chu Feng became the focus of the entire plaza.<br>It turned out that those people were all waiting for him.<br>Chu Feng felt the situation to be fishy. Not only was he suspended in midair, and not only was the spirit power still enveloping him, but it had also transformed into chains that bound him.<br>Chu Feng seemed like a prisoner who was being publicly displayed and awaiting a trial.<br>But, what sort of crime had he committed?<br>&ldquo;Brazen criminal, report your name!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a furious shout was heard. Looking towards the voice, Chu Feng discovered that there were several figures in the crowd.<br>Judging from their outfits, Chu Feng was able to tell that those people were all guardians of the Seven Suns Mountain Range.<br>As for the person who had shouted at him, he wore a white gown. He was the leader of the guardians, Lord White Gown.<br>&ldquo;Why are you arresting me?&rdquo;<br>Being arrested in such a manner, Chu Feng narrowed his brows and displayed his displeasure.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s displeasure was only returned with sneers from those guardians. In fact, the anger on their faces was even more intense than that on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;Why arrest you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You ignored the rules and entered the World Spirit Mansion Gate as someone older than a hundred years of age to scramble for treasures against the people of the younger generation! Yet you dare ask me why I&rsquo;m arresting you?! Do you know what honor and shame is?!&rdquo; Lord White Cloak shouted angrily.<br>At that moment, the already noisy crowd became even more clamorous. They were all gesticulating at Chu Feng.<br>Even the people from the Watermirror Paradise were frowning.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that senior was truly that cheater.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, why would senior do that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior doesn&rsquo;t seem like that sort of shameless person.&rdquo;<br>Yang Shenshen and the others were all confused. They were unable to understand why Chu Feng would do such a thing.<br>Even though they still felt great respect for Chu Feng since he had helped them enormously, his incomparably upright image in their hearts had fallen by a lot.<br>Whilst Yang Shenshen and the others were only confused as to why Chu Feng would do such a thing, the others were not that courteous toward him.<br>After the gesticulations, they began to speak words of insult towards Chu Feng. All sorts of insults and curses resounded nonstop.<br>They behaved like he was some sort of intolerably evil man. The crowd were simply itching to swallow him whole.<br></p></div>
