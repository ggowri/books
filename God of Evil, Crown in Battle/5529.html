        <h1>Chapter 5529: An Opportunity</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Based on what Chu Feng knew, his maternal grandfather was likely to be the culprit who had incarcerated his mother. If he wished to save his mother, his maternal grandfather would be the greatest obstacle in the way.</span><br><span>&ldquo;In other words, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is behind the survival of the </span><span>Totem Phoenix Clan and the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan? Those conniving bastards!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Muxi lost her temper. It was one thing for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to lend a helping hand to the Totem Phoenix Clan, but the Totem Dragon Clan had a grudge against the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan!</span><br><span>It was an act of gross disrespect from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master to protect the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan and even have them perform the same mission as their Totem Dragon Clan.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I was not supposed to talk about this. Father instructed me to keep this matter confidential. I also didn&rsquo;t expect things to turn out like that. Our father was probably kept in the dark about the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan&rsquo;s survival and participation in this mission. He wouldn&rsquo;t have agreed to it if he had known about it beforehand. We can only proceed on with our original plan for the time being since we aren&rsquo;t able to leave this place. But&hellip; what if our father does know about the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan&rsquo;s survival and participation?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked.</span><br><span>He tried his best to explain his stance, fearful that Long Muxi would blame him upon learning that he had kept them in the dark.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t blame yourself for this. You did what you had to. Let&rsquo;s ask our father about it once we get out of here,&rdquo; Long Muxi replied.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu breathed a sigh of relief. He was very concerned about how his big sister viewed him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, your maternal grandfather is quite an incredible figure. He was able to bring two powerful clans under his thumb and make them serve him,&rdquo; Eggy said with a grim voice.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Chu Feng agreed. He had to admit that his maternal grandfather was a person with means, but this wasn&rsquo;t good news to him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, what do you think of the situation? Did the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion secretly protect the Totem Phoenix Clan and Blood-eyed Qilin Clan under its wings? Are those two clans now under the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s charge?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Earlier, when I crossed blows with Feng Jiuyue, she invoked a world spiritist treasure that restricted the use of martial power. Only spirit power can be used inside the formation. That treasure was from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. I asked her what her relationship with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was, but she refused to answer,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>It was not a direct answer, but it revealed his take on the matter.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Damn it! The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is bringing out the tricks they have been hoarding up their sleeves now that God&rsquo;s Era has started!&rdquo; Long Chengyu gritted his teeth in anger.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you know the benefits the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion offered your Totem Dragon Clan for this mission?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;My father only told me that this is a request from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master, and they need juniors with strong bloodlines. I&rsquo;m not sure about the benefits offered,&rdquo; Long Chengyu replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Your father would never make a disadvantageous deal, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course not. Our Totem Dragon Clan is considered an equal to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.&rdquo; Long Chengyu was implying that the Totem Dragon Clan would never work for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion without gains.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s continue according to your father&rsquo;s will then. We can settle the rest once we&rsquo;re out of here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>The earth suddenly shook, and those incomplete formations were snuffed out.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is it break time again?&rdquo; Long Chengyu sighed.</span><br><span>Chu Feng quickly took out the compass and placed it on the ground.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Long Chengyu and Long Muxi glanced over.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This compass concerns our survival. I&rsquo;ll have to fully focus on it,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>Those words relayed the importance of the compass to Long Chengyu and Long Muxi, so they stopped probing despite their curiosity. Instead, they also observed the compass as well, hoping to lend a hand in deciphering its secrets.</span><br><span>Soon, the inscriptions on the compass began moving, but their movements were starkly different from before. Chu Feng intently studied their movements, not daring to blink in the least.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu and Long Muxi did the same too, but the more they observed the inscriptions, the more frustrated they felt. They felt like they were slowly losing their minds.</span><br><span>In the end, Long Chengyu could only give up on it. By then, his face was also covered in sweat, and he was gasping for air. It was so exhausting studying the compass that it felt like he had been liberated now that he was no longer looking at it.</span><br><span>He glanced at his big sister and saw that the latter was not observing the compass either. She, too, was sweating profusely and gasping for air.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng is out of the world,&rdquo; Long Chengyu sent a voice transmission to Long Muxi.</span><br><span>Surprisingly, Long Muxi chuckled at those words. Her laughter was faint, but it showed that she agreed with him too. While the two of them had given up, Chu Feng was still intently staring at the compass without the slightest change in his expression.</span><br><span>Everything Chu Feng did seemed to be a subtle reminder of the huge gap between them.</span><br><span>Chu Feng studied the compass for four whole hours. It only came to an end when the formations came back up, and the compass reverted to its original state.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How is it, Chu Feng? Did you decipher anything?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;None at all. There&rsquo;s no martial enlightenment or the sort in there this time around, but I did learn something,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>It was then Chu Feng noticed that the avatars above Long Chengyu and Long Muxi&rsquo;s heads had expanded to envelop their bodies.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Did this just happen?&rdquo; Chu Feng stood up and asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. This only happened after the break time ended. However, it seems to be beneficial,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said with an excited smile as he studied the avatar cloaking him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you feel anything?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I feel great. With the help of the avatar, all I need is an impetus to greatly enhance my bloodline power,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I sensed too.&rdquo;</span><br><span>While Chu Feng could only observe it from the outside, he could tell that the avatar contained a highly beneficial power to Long Chengyu and the others that could be triggered by an impetus.</span></p></div>
