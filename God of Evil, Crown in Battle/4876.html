        <h1>Chapter 4875</h1>
        <div>: Advice<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone&rsquo;s eyes locked onto the elder standing behind Shengguang Xuanye, and the entire world fell silent.<br>The crowd chose to keep their mouths tightly shut, not daring to let out a squeak at all.<br>There were even some elders who feared that their juniors would be unable to read the atmosphere, so they clasped their hands around their juniors&rsquo; mouths to stop them from saying anything.<br>They could all sense the elder possessed terrifying strength that surpassed that of Shengguang Xuanye. Even the lightning beast in the sky was suppressed by him.<br>It was as if he had become the ruler of this land.<br>Even if he wasn&rsquo;t at peak Martial Exalted level yet, it was likely that he had already reached rank eight Martial Exalted level at the very minimum, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t have been so overwhelmingly powerful.<br>That was a level that countless people dreamed of reaching!<br>But even powerhouses like the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster, Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, and the Cloudsky Immortal Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster would likely never reach such a height in their lifetime, let alone the others.<br>They wouldn&rsquo;t even dare speak up in front of such a figure, let alone offend him. Just a single wrong word could very well plunge their respective powers into a calamity.<br>&ldquo;Is this the<br>Valley they spoke of? Why have we never heard of it before?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is there some sort of connection between the<br>Valley and the Holy Light Clan?&rdquo;<br>This was the first time that the crowd was hearing of the power named<br>Valley. Earlier, Daoist Niantian was able to instill deep fear into Shengguang Xuanye just by revealing his<br>Valley token, and now, someone from the<br>Valley had made his appearance.<br>The result didn&rsquo;t disappoint. The<br>Valley was as powerful as the crowd imagined it to be.<br>Shoosh!<br>Chu Feng opened his left hand, releasing a blinding light that swiftly enveloped the land.<br>At the same time, a formation emerged from the light. It was a teleportation formation.<br>Chu Feng was confident that he could defeat Shengguang Xuanye with the Second Slash, but to be safe, he still prepared a teleportation formation in case he needed to escape.<br>&ldquo;This is bad!&rdquo;<br>But as soon as he activated the teleportation formation, he knew that things had gone awry.<br>The teleportation formation should have brought him out right away, but he still remained where he was despite having activated it. This meant that the teleportation had failed.<br>&ldquo;Why are you in such a rush to leave when you&rsquo;re already here?&rdquo;<br>The white-browed elder from the<br>Valley smiled at Chu Feng, but it was clear that it was a smile filled with sinister intention.<br>&ldquo;You were the one who stopped the formation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Why ask the obvious? Shengguang Xuanye is protected by our<br>Valley. Your act of challenging Shengguang Xuanye is equivalent to insulting us!&rdquo; the white-browed elder said.<br>It was clear to everyone that Chu Feng had landed himself in a bad spot.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, young friend Chu Feng doesn&rsquo;t know that the<br>Valley is backing the Holy Light Clan. The ignorant shouldn&rsquo;t be blamed for their misdeeds. Shouldn&rsquo;t we discuss this matter carefully?&rdquo;<br>A figure suddenly appeared beside Chu Feng. It was Daoist Niantian.<br>&ldquo;Niantian, you might be an honorary elder of our<br>Valley, but I advise you not to meddle too much in our affairs,&rdquo; the white-browed elder replied.<br>Tzlala!<br>The lightning in the sky started to dissipate.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng!!!&rdquo;<br>Following that, a silhouette suddenly rushed toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s side.<br>&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo;<br>The white-browed elder waved his sleeves, and a surge of power rushed toward the person approaching Chu Feng. The surge of power caused the person&rsquo;s clothes and appearance to morph, revealing an unexpected person beneath the disguise.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao?!&rdquo;<br>The crowd could recognize right away that it was Long Xiaoxiao. They didn&rsquo;t expect Long Xiaoxiao to be here too.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao.&rdquo;<br>As soon as Long Xiaoxiao was curbed by the white-browed elder, another figure quickly rushed toward where Long Xiaoxiao was. It was just that the figure had her disguise stripped off and was forcefully frozen in mid-air too.<br>She was no other than Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother.<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Xuanye, I&rsquo;ll leave things to you here.&rdquo;<br>The white-browed elder from the<br>Valley vanished after stopping Long Xiaoxiao and her mother in place. The next moment, he was already standing right beside Chu Feng.<br>Daoist Niantian was currently treating him.<br>&ldquo;How is it? Will he lose his life?&rdquo; the white-browed elder asked.<br>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look optimistic,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian replied.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll suffice as long as he doesn&rsquo;t die. He can&rsquo;t die yet.&rdquo;<br>The white-browed elder stretched his hand forth to grab Chu Feng, but Daoist Niantian also grabbed Chu Feng at the same time.<br>&ldquo;Niantian, are you really intending to make an enemy out of me?&rdquo; the white-browed elder asked with a menacing glare.<br>&ldquo;Lord<br>, some words of advice. Don&rsquo;t threaten Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;<br>It was only after saying those words that he finally released his grip on Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>However, the white-browed elder let out a cold sneer and scoffed, &ldquo;Niantian, to think that you&rsquo;re an honorary elder of our<br>Valley. Shouldn&rsquo;t you know the power of our<br>Valley better than anyone else? It&rsquo;s one thing if our<br>Valley didn&rsquo;t make an appearance, but now that we have come out of our seclusion, we&rsquo;ll be the only overlords of the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s nothing more than a mere junior, and you&rsquo;re advising me not to touch him? Are you saying that his background is something that even our<br>Valley needs to tread carefully around?&rdquo;<br>In his eyes, Daoist Niantian&rsquo;s words were nothing more than a joke.<br>&ldquo;Lord<br>, I&rsquo;ve already said my piece. It&rsquo;s up to you to decide whether you wish to heed my advice or not,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian replied.<br>&ldquo;It looks like you have gone senile from practicing your world spiritist techniques!&rdquo;<br>The white-browed elder sneered coldly before leaving the scene, taking Chu Feng away with him.<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief turned pale upon seeing that Chu Feng had been taken away by the white-browed elder. He had chosen to stand with Chu Feng, but the circumstances clearly showed that Chu Feng had been defeated.<br>Didn&rsquo;t this spell a calamity for the Dragon Clan?<br>Speak of the devil, Shengguang Xuanye directed cold eyes on him the next moment.<br>&ldquo;The members of the Dragon Clan have colluded with Chu Feng to betray our Holy Light Galaxy. Men, round up the members of the Dragon Clan!&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye spat through gritted teeth.<br>He had recovered a fair bit, but he was still in a frail condition. While Chu Feng&rsquo;s First Slash, Heavenly Lightning Appearance failed to kill him, it did inflict considerable damage on him.<br>Shengguang Xuanye felt incredibly humiliated that he was actually injured by a mere junior, but what was unacceptable was how he nearly lost his life if not for Lord<br>&rsquo; intervention.<br>And such a sight was witnessed by everyone present.<br>What would become of his dignity?<br>Since Chu Feng was taken away by Lord<br>, it meant that he couldn&rsquo;t kill Chu Feng himself to exact vengeance. Given so, he could only vent his anger on the Dragon Clan.<br>It turned out that Shengguang Xuanye wasn&rsquo;t the only angry one here. The entire Holy Light Clan was infuriated by Chu Feng&rsquo;s transgression.<br>The moment he gave his order, the members from the Holy Light Clan drew their weapons and began charging at the members of the Dragon Clan.<br>&ldquo;Formation, activate!&rdquo;<br>However, Daoist Niantian suddenly let out a bellow. There was a flash of brilliant light right after.<br>By the time the light vanished, Daoist Niantian, Long Xiaoxiao and her mother, and everyone from the Dragon Clan had disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Niantian, are you intending to betray our Holy Light Galaxy too?!&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye roared.<br>Unexpectedly, he received a response from Daoist Niantian from an immeasurable distance away.<br>&ldquo;Lord Xuanye, I&rsquo;m not doing this to protect the Dragon Clan but your Holy Light Clan. If you really destroyed the Dragon Clan today, not even the<br>Valley will be able to protect you when Chu Feng returns.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
