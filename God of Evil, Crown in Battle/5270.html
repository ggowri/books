        <h1>Chapter 5271</h1>
        <div>: True Capabilities<br>&ldquo;Lass, you have a lot of treasures on you.&rdquo;<br>The black aura receded to form a long passageway. From the other end of the passageway, a silhouette was making its way toward the mysterious woman. It was an old monk dressed in a golden kasaya. His skin was purple, and his eyes were ferocious like a wild beast.<br>He emanated a frightening vibe, not just because of his appearance but his aura too. He was the kind of person who wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to take a person&rsquo;s life.<br>However, the mysterious woman wasn&rsquo;t intimidated in the least. She glanced at the old monk before peering into the depths of the world. She found that the person standing beneath the cauldron was still there.<br>&ldquo;There are two of them?&rdquo;<br>The mysterious woman was unable to clearly perceive the person standing beneath the cauldron, but she sensed that he was likely to be a powerful expert too.<br>Then, she turned her attention back to the old monk.<br>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t dead yet?&rdquo; she asked.<br>&ldquo;You know me?&rdquo; the demon monk asked.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the famous demon monk. There&rsquo;s no way I wouldn&rsquo;t have heard about you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It looks like you&rsquo;re no ordinary lass. Where are you from?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who I am. I&rsquo;ll offer you some words of advice. I won&rsquo;t stop you from exacting vengeance on the Totem Dragon Clan, but you would do well not to implicate the others.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You have someone whom you want to protect&hellip; Is it that brat?&rdquo;<br>The demon monk glanced at the mirror floating beside the mysterious woman, which reflected Chu Feng&rsquo;s silhouette.<br>Shoosh!<br>The woman hurriedly retracted her mirror as her gaze turned hostile.<br>&ldquo;That brat is indeed a competent one. He was the one who cleared the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant&rsquo;s test,&rdquo; the demon monk said.<br>The mysterious woman didn&rsquo;t answer him, but her eyes were turning increasingly cold.<br>&ldquo;However, I&rsquo;m not the one to decide whether he survives or not. My disciple is there too. That brat might face danger if he wishes to claim the champion seat,&rdquo; the demon monk said.<br>&ldquo;Your disciple is that little monk?&rdquo; the mysterious woman asked.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; the demon monk sneered.<br>The mysterious woman peered into the depths of the realm, where the other person was still channeling the cauldron to produce more black aura. &ldquo;Get him to stop.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you giving me an order?&rdquo; the demon monk asked.<br>&ldquo;Heed my words if you wish to live.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lass, I know that you have someone strong behind you, but you should know your place. I&rsquo;ll teach you a lesson today!&rdquo;<br>Woosh!<br>The black aura began charging toward the mysterious woman like an army of cavalrymen.<br>&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo;<br>The mysterious woman released a burst of red aura.<br>Astonishingly, cries of agony could be heard when the two auras collided. The red aura was devouring the black aura.<br>The demon monk realized that the red aura wasn&rsquo;t the mysterious woman&rsquo;s own strength but the armor she was wearing. The armor glowed with a red light and emanated the aura of the Ancient Era.<br>&ldquo;What a formidable treasure. Who are you? Are you from the Ancient Era?&rsquo; the demon monk asked.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask. You aren&rsquo;t qualified to know,&rdquo; the mysterious woman said as she pointed her finger at the demon monk.<br>Weng!<br>The red aura around her morphed into countless ferocious beasts that charged at the demon monk.<br>&ldquo;What arrogance.&rdquo;<br>With a roar, the demon monk released a flood of black aura that gushed at the mysterious woman.<br>Boom!<br>The collision of the red and black auras devastated everything in their vicinity, shattering even space itself. Even the shockwaves were enough to bring down True God level cultivators. It was truly fortunate that this terrifying showdown was restricted to the formation space.<br>As a result, the crowd outside remained oblivious to the happenings here.<br>&hellip;<br>Standing at the peak of the tower, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes were fixated on the eighth tower. All other duels had concluded except for the one between the little monk and Mo Yuhan.<br>Bam!<br>The tower gates finally opened.<br>Mo Yuhan was teleported out, and the little monk ascended to the peak of the tower. It went without saying that the victor of the duel was the little monk.<br>What was worth mentioning was that even though Mo Yuhan had fallen in defeat, she looked perfectly healthy except for her pale face.<br>&ldquo;That brother over there, I kept my promise and went easy on that young miss. I didn&rsquo;t hurt her at all,&rdquo; the little monk said.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, be careful of that monk. He&rsquo;s extremely powerful. He was toying with me throughout the entire duel, not showing any of his true skills at all,&rdquo; Mo Yuhan sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng.<br>Weng!<br>Surges of teleportation energy enveloped Chu Feng and the other victors of the first round, transporting them to the entrances of the second layer&rsquo;s towers.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s opponent for the second round was Ouyang Canjian.<br>Ouyang Canjian stepped into the tower with a domineering air, and Chu Feng did the same too.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, I&rsquo;ll be making my move if you&rsquo;re ready,&rdquo; Ouyang Canjian said.<br>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.<br>Shoosh!<br>Ouyang Canjian charged at Chu Feng with incredible speed to thrust his palm toward the latter&rsquo;s chest, only to freeze in the next instant. The palm that was about to strike Chu Feng&rsquo;s chest was suddenly stopped in its tracks.<br>Chu Feng had grabbed his wrist.<br>Without any hesitation, Chu Feng raised his other free hand and sunk his fist into Ouyang Canjian&rsquo;s chest.<br>Ouyang Canjian couldn&rsquo;t dodge the attack due to his hand being held in place, so he could only counterattack with a punch of his own. Despite his best attempt to protect himself, his face still scrunched in pain.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s punch had smashed Ouyang Canjian&rsquo;s hand into smithereens, and he didn&rsquo;t just stop there. He pushed forward with the remaining momentum of his punch to puncture Ouyang Canjian&rsquo;s chest.<br>Pu!<br>It was only after impaling Ouyang Canjian&rsquo;s chest that Chu Feng finally released him, and Ouyang Canjian fell powerlessly to the ground.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>Ouyang Canjian stared at Chu Feng in disbelief.<br>While the two of them were exchanging fists, Chu Feng had swiftly activated his Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor, raising his fighting prowess by two cultivation ranks. On the other hand, Ouyang Canjian was caught off guard and didn&rsquo;t have the time to raise his fighting prowess.<br>This resulted in the fast conclusion of the duel.<br>&ldquo;I know that you&rsquo;re reluctant to accept this outcome, but you deserve this loss. You have drawn your sword against your first opponent, but you didn&rsquo;t bother to do so against me. Don&rsquo;t you know that there&rsquo;s nothing more foolish than to underestimate your opponent?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Ouyang Canjian was capable of much more than this, but even the slightest mistake in a duel was more than enough to cost one&rsquo;s victory.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I deserved it,&rdquo; Ouyang Canjian replied with a lowered head.<br>Chu Feng smiled at that sight. Even though Ouyang Canjian had underestimated him, he did seem to be a decent person judging by how he willingly acknowledged his own mistake.<br>Weng!<br>Chu Feng was teleported to the peak of the tower whereas Ouyang Canjian was ejected from the tower.<br>Whoosh!<br>The crowd was baffled. This was not the outcome they had expected.<br>The only ones who were able to remain calm were Mo Yuhan and Tang Xiu, but astonishment could still be seen reflected in their eyes. They did think that it was possible for Chu Feng to win the fight, but one had to know that Ouyang Canjian was no ordinary cultivator either. Even if Chu Feng won the fight, it should have at least taken some time.<br>&ldquo;It looks like I have underestimated Brother Chu Feng,&rdquo; Tang Xiu said as he patted his chest in relief.<br>He did hesitate when he admitted his defeat earlier, but this outcome assured him that he had made the right choice.<br>However, not everyone was able to readily accept this outcome as Tang Xiu did.<br>&ldquo;Elder Ouyang, how did you fall in defeat? Did Chu Feng cheat?&rdquo;<br>The crowd gathered around Ouyang Canjian to ask about the details of the battle. They couldn&rsquo;t believe that Chu Feng really possessed the strength to defeat Ouyang Canjian.<br>&ldquo;I lost fair and square,&rdquo; Ouyang Canjian replied.<br>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The crowd was baffled.<br>They were still unwilling to believe that Chu Feng really possessed such strength despite Ouyang Canjian acknowledging his own defeat, such that some of them even glared at Chu Feng. They thought that Chu Feng was cheating.<br>&ldquo;They seem to harbor doubts about your strength,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of my business. Why should I care about their opinion?&rdquo; Chu Feng scoffed.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. They are just a bunch of clowns.&rdquo; Eggy agreed.<br>Weng!<br>The duel of another tower concluded. The victor was Xu Tianjian.<br>As soon as Xu Tianjian was teleported to the peak of the tower, he turned to Chu Feng and saw him standing there with a look of shock.<br>A few moments later, the little monk also appeared at the peak of another tower. He had also won his duel.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes narrowed.<br>The little monk&rsquo;s opponent was the elder with a veiled bamboo hat. The latter had accumulated significant strength and was definitely not an opponent to be made light of. The fact that the little monk was able to defeat him so quickly showed that he had truly gone easy on Mo Yuhan.<br>Otherwise, his battle with Mo Yuhan wouldn&rsquo;t have lasted that long.<br>&ldquo;Ouyang Canjian was defeated?&rdquo; an incredulous voice echoed.<br>The victor of the second tower emerged. It was Gong Liangjin.<br>Gong Liangjin was shocked at Ouyang Canjian&rsquo;s defeat, but there was an irrepressible smile on his lips.<br>&ldquo;This must be heaven&rsquo;s will. I&rsquo;m not confident of defeating Xu Tianjian, but it looks like I&rsquo;m at least secured for second place!&rdquo; Gong Liangjin laughed arrogantly.<br>He didn&rsquo;t care about how Chu Feng won the battle. All that mattered to him was that Chu Feng had helped him get rid of a difficult enemy.<br>&ldquo;Ey, Gong Liangjin sure is lucky. He&rsquo;s going to get the second place for free.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But how the hell did Ouyang Canjian fall in defeat?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What means did that fellow use? Is it a secret assault? Or did Ouyang Canjian and Tang Xiu go easy on him in view of his backing?&rdquo;<br>The crowd couldn&rsquo;t understand what had happened. They felt pity and even rage for Ouyang Canjian&rsquo;s defeat. Most of them had been anticipating a showdown between Ouyang Canjian and Xu Tianjian, but Chu Feng had ruined their expectations.<br>Even if they knew deep down that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t as powerless as they thought him out to be, they were still unwilling to accept that he won fair and square.<br>Teleportation energy enveloped the surviving participants, signaling the commencement of the next round of duels. Chu Feng and Gong Liangjin were teleported to the first tower of the third layer, whereas Xu Tianjian and the little monk were teleported to the second tower.<br>The victors of the respective duels would proceed to the final showdown.<br>&ldquo;This little friend here, I don&rsquo;t care how you defeated Ouyang Canjian, but you shouldn&rsquo;t expect any mercy from me. Give it all you got right from the start lest you are left with any regrets.&rdquo;<br>Gong Liangjin could hardly stop himself from laughing as he spoke. He was acting as if he had already won the battle.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I won&rsquo;t go easy on you either,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Oh? That would be for the best&hellip; Hahahaha!&rdquo; Gong Liangjin laughed.<br>Chu Feng responded with a smile before entering the tower. Gong Liangjin leisurely followed suit.<br>Bam!<br>The tower gates barely closed for a brief moment before abruptly opening once more. Gong Liangjin shot out of the tower. The smile on his face had vanished, and he was crying in agony.<br>His dantian had been pierced.<br>The crowd widened their eyes in horror. Even Xu Tianjian also looked at Chu Feng in a different light.<br>He hadn&rsquo;t even entered the tower with the little monk yet, but the duel between Chu Feng and Gong Liangjin had already concluded.<br>This was definitely not a fluke. Chu Feng was the real deal.<br>&ldquo;Even Gong Liangjin has fallen in tragic defeat.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heaven! Is he really that strong?&rdquo;<br>An uproar broke out amidst the crowd.<br>It was then that Tang Xiu finally spoke up, &ldquo;Why else do you think I admitted defeat? I congratulated Brother Chu Feng for winning the title of the strongest because I knew from the start how strong he is.&rdquo;<br>Tang Xiu laughed as if he had anticipated all of this.<br>It finally dawned on the crowd that Tang Xiu had only surrendered because he knew how powerful Chu Feng was. Those who had previously harbored doubts about Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength had no choice but to admit his strength now.<br>After all, they had just witnessed with their own eyes Gong Liangjin&rsquo;s tragic defeat!<br>&ldquo;Who in the world is he?&rdquo;<br>Those who had grumbled about Chu Feng being a fluke earlier were now looking at him with a mixture of respect and fear. They finally understood that Chu Feng was the dark horse of the tournament, one that could very well rise to the very top!<br>&ldquo;They are now looking at you in a different light. Some of them even seem to be afraid of you,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t surprised at all.<br>Strength was the voice of the cultivators in the world of cultivation. To win other people&rsquo;s respect, he had to show that he was worthy of it. Those who possessed true capabilities were never afraid of doubt.<br></div>
