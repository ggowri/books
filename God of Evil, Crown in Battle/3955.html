        <div> - This Item Is Extraordinary<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, Chu Feng proceeded towards the location where the people from the Red-dress Holy Land were.<br>He wanted to inform them of what had happened on Mount Ivory Valley so that they could prepare mentally.<br>To Chu Feng&rsquo;s surprise, by the time he arrived, everyone from the Red-dress Holy Land had left. Furthermore, they did not leave any clues as to where they went.<br>That being said, judging from the appearance of things, the people from the Red-dress Holy Land didn&rsquo;t seem to have been attacked. Instead, it seemed more like they&rsquo;d decided to leave on their own.<br>Chu Feng did not directly leave. Instead, he proceeded to the Seven Suns Mountain Range.<br>He wanted to inform Yuan Shu about those Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms.<br>However, when he reached the Seven Suns Mountain Range, he learned that Yuan Shu was not present either.<br>Due to the urgent timing of things, Chu Feng needed to proceed for the All-heaven Upper Realm without delay. Thus, Chu Feng told the guards of the Seven Suns Mountain Range about what had happened on Mount Ivory Valley.<br>Then, Chu Feng proceeded to the All-heaven Upper Realm and arrived at the appointed place with the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>The place that they&rsquo;d agreed to meet at was a little abandoned fishing village.<br>This little fishing village was very close to the All-heaven Sect. However, it was now completely empty.<br>All of the villagers had left the village. The reason for that was because it was too close to the All-heaven Sect.<br>The All-heaven Sect was extremely tyrannical. They refused to allow any power to be permanently established within ten thousand miles of them.<br>Because of that, the surrounding ten thousand miles around the All-heaven Sect were completely devoid of human habitation. Apart from travelers, martial cultivators were rarely seen, and simply no one lived in the area.<br>That said, the Mystic Cave Saints had waited for Chu Feng in the fishing village for a long time already.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, you&rsquo;re finally here. We&rsquo;d thought that something had happened to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right. We were truly worried about you. Seeing that you&rsquo;re fine, we are truly relieved.&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints were all overjoyed to see Chu Feng.<br>Their emotional appearance looked rather exaggerated. However, they didn&rsquo;t seem to be faking it either.<br>Although Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints had not known each other for long, Chu Feng was already someone with a special status in the hearts of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Not only did I not encounter any mishaps, I instead managed to gain some harvest,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Harvest? What sort of harvest?&rdquo; Hearing the word &lsquo;harvest,&rsquo; the interest of the Mystic Cave Saints was immediately perked.<br>Chu Feng knew the personality of the Mystic Cave Saints very well. Since they were curious, he would have to explain things to them. If he didn&rsquo;t, the Mystic Cave Saints would continue to pester him to no end.<br>As such, he did not bother to conceal things from the Mystic Cave Saints. He informed them of everything that had happened in the Galewind Hunting Clan.<br>He even told them about the divine deer.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, could you display that Ancient Era&rsquo;s secret skill again?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right. Show it to us so that we can see it for ourselves, and properly help you determine what level of secret skill it is.&rdquo;<br>After hearing Chu Feng talk about the divine deer, the Mystic Cave Saints all became very interested in it.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already told you that I am unable to control that power. Unless it wants to, I am unable to unleash it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a sigh.<br>&ldquo;Hearing what you&rsquo;ve said, that thing is truly remarkable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Treasure. Brother Asura, you&rsquo;ve picked up an extraordinary otherworldly treasure. That&rsquo;s simply an enormous fortune, an enormous opportunity that you&rsquo;ve received. Fate, oh that is fate. You are truly fortunate.&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints were wild with joy. They acted as if they were the ones that had obtained the Ancient Era&rsquo;s secret skill.<br>&ldquo;Well then, I&rsquo;ve already told you what I&rsquo;ve experienced.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s discuss proper business. How are preparations for this operation coming along?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You said to leave everything to you, that I merely needed to arrive on time,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, you can set your mind to ease at how we handle things.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;During these days, we&rsquo;ve spent a great amount of resources to set up a grand formation outside the All-heaven Sect. Once that grand formation is set in motion, no one will be able to cause you harm within a short period of time. At that time, you&rsquo;ll be able to escape safely.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for sneaking in to plunder the treasure, it is not something that will pose a problem for you to begin with. After all, you&rsquo;re a person of the younger generation. Thus, you merely need to disguise yourself, and you&rsquo;ll be able to enter that spirit formation space.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once you&rsquo;ve entered that spirit formation space, you&rsquo;ll be able to do whatever you please. Those people of the younger generation are simply no match for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the experts of the All-heaven Sect, no matter how powerful they might be, they are unable to enter that world spirit space due to their age. Thus, the treasure is yours to take.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once you leave that world spirit space, we will activate the grand formation. With that, you&rsquo;ll be able to escape,&rdquo; said the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;That spirit formation is truly that powerful?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, the spirit formation will definitely not let you down. For the sake of that spirit formation, we&rsquo;ve put forth enormous strength. We guarantee that no one will be able to cause you harm. Not to mention the All-heaven Sect, even the overlords of other starfields will not be able to do anything to you,&rdquo; the Mystic Cave Saints guaranteed as they patted their chests.<br>&ldquo;With how powerful that spirit formation is, are we able to utilize it to kill them?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Kill who? You want to kill the headmaster of the All-heaven Sect?&rdquo; asked the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Is the spirit formation capable of that?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No, it wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do that. Although that spirit formation is capable of protecting you thoroughly, it is unable to harm them. Furthermore, that spirit formation can only be used for a limited period of time. You must escape within the time limit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, it&rsquo;s like this. Our spirit formation could be considered to be a temporary spatial teleportation formation. Once you exit the space with the treasures, you will enter the spirit formation, and the spirit formation will be able to directly teleport you to a safe region.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, we will prepare the imprint on your body ahead of time. Only by using that imprint will one be able to enter that spirit formation and be teleported.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, even if the people from the All-heaven Sect want to pursue you, they will not be able to.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They can only look on helplessly as you take away their treasures, and be unable to do anything,&rdquo; added the eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case. I understand then,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, you can rest assured. We will not harm you. Our preparations are absolutely safe. In fact&hellip; we&rsquo;ve spent a great amount of effort to obtain a treasure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s this.&rdquo;<br>As the eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints spoke, he took out an item from his body.<br>It was a little golden person. That person was fully made of golden gases.<br>Chu Feng was able to sense enormous power from the little golden person.<br>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This here is a remarkable item.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should one activate this item, one will be able to fight against the people from the All-heaven Sect!&rdquo; the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints said proudly.<br></p></div>
