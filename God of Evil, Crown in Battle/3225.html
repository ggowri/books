        <div> - Walking Right Into The Trap<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bringing Chu Qing and the others with him, Chu Feng proceeded toward the other locations with cultivation resources that he knew about.<br>Without the other people following them, Chu Feng and the others were able to enjoy all of the cultivation resources that he found.<br>The whole process went very smoothly. Chu Feng, Chu Qing and the others began to extract the various cultivation resources at the various locations. After they finished extracting cultivation resources from a site, they immediately left for the next site. In a short period of three days, Chu Feng and the others had finished extracting cultivation resources from eighteen different sites.<br>After the eighteen sites were all exhausted, Chu Feng, Chu Qing, Chu Shuangshuang, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu&rsquo;s cosmos sacks were all filled with ores.<br>Even though those ores were only the size of a fingernail, they actually managed to fill up cosmos sacks. From this, one could imagine how many ores Chu Feng and the others had plucked.<br>Feeling the ores in their Cosmos Sacks, Chu Qing, Chu Shuangshuang, Chu Huanyu and Chu Haoyan were all very excited.<br>Those ores were such great cultivation resources. Once their seals were undone, they would be able to refine those ores and begin training.<br>Chu Qing and the others all felt that they would be able to obtain a great harvest. As for making a breakthrough in their cultivation, that was simply something that was certain to happen. Currently, the only thing that they were uncertain about was exactly how many levels of cultivation they would be able to break through.<br>To martial cultivators, making a breakthrough in cultivation was very difficult to do.<br>As such, they would naturally be very happy to be able to attain breakthroughs so quickly.<br>What brought them the greatest amount of joy was the fact that Chu Feng was still bringing them along to seek out more cultivation resources even though they&rsquo;d already exhausted eighteen sites of their cultivation resources.<br>The guidance that Chu Feng obtained from the Holy Spirit Beast&rsquo;s power had bestowed on him a total of twenty sites of cultivation resources.<br>He gave the location of one site to the Li Heavenly Clan and brought the others to another site. As for the remaining eighteen sites, Chu Feng had completely excavated them with Chu Qing and the others.<br>Although they had obtained a great harvest already, Chu Feng felt that the cultivation resources in the Holy Spirit Formation of Light were most definitely not limited to those mere twenty sites.<br>Thus, Chu Feng began to seek out new cultivation resources. During this process, Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes were extremely effective.<br>To put it briefly, the Holy Spirit Formation of Light was simply prepared for Chu Feng.<br>Even if Chu Feng did not obtain guidance from the Holy Spirit Beast&rsquo;s power, the harvest Chu Feng would be able to acquire was definitely not something that others could compare with.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng&rsquo;s target was very clear.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng was practically certain that this place possessed an extremely vast amount of cultivation resources.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, we&rsquo;ve already been in the Holy Spirit Formation of Light for three days now. We have occasionally encountered newcomers that entered this place together with us during the past three days. As such, why haven&rsquo;t we encountered any newcomers from the Linghu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be possible for them to not have come in here. In that case, what exactly have they been doing? Do you have any guesses?&rdquo; Chu Shuangshuang asked.<br>Although they&rsquo;d been unscathed during the past three days, Chu Shuangshuang was still worried.<br>As the saying goes, the weather would always be exceptionally calm before a storm arrived.<br>Thus, the peacefulness of the past three days instead caused Chu Shuangshuang to feel even more uneasy.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never been to this Formation of Light before. It is our first time entering it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As such, we do not know about the cultivation methods inside the Formation of Light.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the Linghu Heavenly Clan must know. After all, they&rsquo;ve occupied the Formation of Light for quite some time now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, in all likelihood, they haven&rsquo;t been idling around.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, I also don&rsquo;t know exactly what they&rsquo;ve been doing over the past three days,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, rumbles suddenly sounded from the central region of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>Following that, many golden lights began to shine from afar in wave upon wave. It was very eye-catching.<br>The golden lights were simply too dazzling. Even though Chu Feng and the others were very far away from the central region, they still managed to see the spectacular sight of the golden lights.<br>It was as if there were golden waves being spread in the sky repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an abnormal sign. For an abnormal sign to appear, a treasure must&rsquo;ve appeared there,&rdquo; Chu Huanyu and Chu Haoyan became extremely excited upon seeing the golden lights.<br>Even Chu Qing and Chu Shuangshaung revealed excited expressions in their eyes.<br>&ldquo;That is not an abnormal sign caused by the appearance of a treasure,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What? That isn&rsquo;t an abnormal sign caused by the appearance of a treasure? Then&hellip; what is it?&rdquo;<br>Chu Qing and the others&rsquo; expressions all changed upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;While that is indeed an extraordinary abnormal sign, it is artificial, not natural,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Artificial? You&rsquo;re saying that someone deliberately created that abnormal sign? But&hellip; who would do that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be, it&rsquo;s the Linghu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>Chu Huanyu and the others were originally confused when Chu Feng said it was artificial. However, they soon thought of a possibility.<br>&ldquo;Apart from the Linghu Heavenly Clan, who else would do that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, the Linghu Heavenly Clan hasn&rsquo;t been idle these past three days. They&rsquo;ve spent three entire days to create such a real-looking abnormal sign. It would appear&hellip; that they are planning to guard the tree-stump and wait for rabbits. Furthermore, there will be many rabbits that walk into their trap,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words had revealed the plot of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>Indeed, the Linghu Heavenly Clan was planning to lure everyone toward that fake abnormal sign. Those that were lured there would definitely end up suffering.<br>&ldquo;That Linghu Heavenly Clan is truly too treacherous. They&rsquo;ve actually used such a trick,&rdquo; Chu Huanyu and Chu Haoyan were unable to keep themselves from cursing out the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>For the sake of avoiding the Linghu Heavenly Clan, the newcomers that had entered did not dare to set foot into the central region of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light. As such, the central region had become a forbidden area for the crowd.<br>However, the Linghu Heavenly Clan had now used such a trick. Likely, a great majority of the newcomers would end up falling for it.<br>As for the reason why, it was all because that abnormal sign was so realistic. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Chu Feng&rsquo;s warning, they too would&rsquo;ve thought that abnormal sign to be real.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, in that case, should we think of a way to inform the others so as to prevent them from being duped?&rdquo; Chu Shuangshuang asked.<br>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t make it in time. Right now, everyone must be proceeding toward it. Furthermore, not even I am able to create an abnormal sign like that. The people of the Linghu Heavenly Clan must&rsquo;ve borrowed the power of some sort of treasure. Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to be able to create an abnormal sign that covers the entire Holy Spirit Formation of Light,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that many people will end up suffering by their hands?&rdquo; Chu Shuangshuang asked.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, that would be the case. However, that has nothing to do with us. We&rsquo;ve already done all that we should. As for the rest, they can only rely on themselves.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re not greedy, they will remain safe and sound. However, if they are greedy, they will definitely suffer.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he continued flying onward toward the site of the cultivation resources he had discovered.<br>Meanwhile, the newcomers that were scattered all over the Holy Spirit Formation of Light were all approaching the central region.<br>They were all duped. They all thought that a treasure had appeared in the central region.<br>One by one, they were walking right into the trap.<br></p></div>
