        <h1>Chapter 5688: Ling Canghai’s Death</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng would have been in danger if Ling </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> protection formation had activated and drawn attention here. However, he quickly realized that the chains were a sealing formation that had not just sealed off Ling </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> body but his treasures too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried using Protection Bane on the sealing formation, but it was to no avail. Protection Bane only worked on protection formations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That cunning old thing is disgusting even after he&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; Chu Feng cursed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked up to the copper cauldron and toppled it with a kick. An incomplete pill carrying an awful blood stench floated out of the cauldron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This pill had been forged with the bloodlines of countless people over tens of thousands of years. Chu Feng would never consume such a pill, not to mention it was incomplete and he couldn&rsquo;t tell what it was for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, he still took away the blood pill and the pill cauldron, not wanting to leave them for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Then, he stowed Ling </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> head into his Cosmos Sack with a wave of his sleeves before quickly leaving the area via Divine Flitting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, how can you move so fast?&rdquo; the Asura King asked in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation was only at rank nine Half-God level, but Chu Feng was moving as fast as normal rank two True God level cultivators.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a divine skill. It&rsquo;s a relief that the old man didn&rsquo;t erect a barrier, else I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to take his life that easily,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I see. Lord Chu Feng is indeed destined for great things,&rdquo; the Asura King remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just lucky, though my luck isn&rsquo;t good today. If not for that old man&rsquo;s sealing formation, I&rsquo;d have been able to gather quite some treasures from him,&rdquo; Chu Feng said regretfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span>, Jie </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span>, Jie </span><span>Qinghe</span><span>, and a few other high-standing elders were gathered in a bamboo forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept all of you waiting.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A person descended from the sky. It was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Paying respects to Lord Mansion Master!&rdquo; The important figures of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion gathered here quickly greeted him with a bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I took some time to settle the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span>. Is </span><span>something up?&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Mansion Master, it&rsquo;s about Chu Feng,&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to talk about Chu Feng?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Mansion Master, Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> brought Chu Feng into the Sacred Mansion today&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you talking about him clearing the Seven Stars Gravity Towers?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, Lord Mansion Master. I didn&rsquo;t know you were aware of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is there a problem with that?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Mansion Master, no one has cleared the Seven Stars Gravity Towers before Chu Feng, and Chu Feng is an outsider. We&rsquo;re worried that our juniors will be affected by this matter, so we wish to consult you on how we should deal with it,&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng has obtained the black imprint that even </span><span>Ranqing</span><span> failed to in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. Granted that he has benefited from </span><span>Ranqing&rsquo;s</span><span> sealing formation, he has still achieved what no one else has. In comparison, the Seven Stars Gravity Towers isn&rsquo;t a big deal. Our juniors have been slacking off recently, so it&rsquo;s a good thing for Chu Feng to stress them a little. You may leave this matter be,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We understand,&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span> replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> and Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder Ling, I&rsquo;ve already told you that there&rsquo;s no need to alarm Lord Mansion Master on this. Lord Mansion Master knows Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent better than you do,&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Nevertheless, I still think it&rsquo;s necessary to consult Lord Mansion Master on this. This concerns how our juniors view Chu Feng in the future, after all,&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You need not intervene in Chu Feng&rsquo;s relationship with our juniors. He might be talented, but there&rsquo;s no guarantee about his future. Just let things be,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We understand,&rdquo; the elders replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Mansion Master.&rdquo; An elder suddenly ran over with a look of fluster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Something bad has happened!&rdquo; The elder whipped out a life token inscribed with the name &lsquo;Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span>&rsquo;, but the token had shattered and was devoid of any hints of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord </span><span>Canghai</span><span> has passed away?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master and his elders were taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t right. We just met Lord </span><span>Canghai</span><span> earlier in the day, and he was doing well. Why would he pass away all of a sudden?&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span> sensed that something was amiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master vanished from the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other elders quickly followed him, but they were nowhere as fast. When they arrived at Ling </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> residence, they were surprised to find an underground </span><span>palace. Their faces scrunched up when they entered the underground palace and smelled the strong blood stench within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their shocked expressions indicated that they weren&rsquo;t aware of this underground palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They went deeper into the underground palace, and it didn&rsquo;t take them long to reach its end. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master was already standing there with Ling </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord </span><span>Canghai</span><span>.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was taken aback. Some of them even burst into tears. Those from the older generation understood Ling </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> significance to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cultivator,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master touched Ling </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> neck and remarked. His eyebrows shot up as he coldly ordered, &ldquo;Investigate all of the True God level cultivators who have recently entered or are currently residing in the mansion!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Understood!&rdquo; the elders replied as they prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master suddenly spoke up, &ldquo;Wait. Don&rsquo;t spread news about Lord </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> death yet. Make sure you don&rsquo;t mention anything about this underground palace to the others too. I won&rsquo;t show any mercy to any of you if you dare sully Lord </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> reputation.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words carried killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We understand!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders implicitly sensed that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master might have known about this underground palace beforehand, but they dared not to ask about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would have feigned ignorance too if they had known that Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span> was committing atrocities.</span></p></div>
