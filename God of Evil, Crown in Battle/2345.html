        <div> - Another Gamble<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;I only want that Stormwind Edge,&rdquo; Chu Feng said calmly.<br>&ldquo;You really dare to ask for that? Don&rsquo;t even think about it!&rdquo; The Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother snarled angrily.<br>&ldquo;In that case, you can choose to comply with your promise and kneel to me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; you are simply trying to profit off another&rsquo;s misfortune!&rdquo; The Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother was so enraged the corners of her mouth started to twitch.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I am trying to profit off another&rsquo;s misfortune,&rdquo; Chu Feng said resolutedly. He did not feel ashamed in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors started to shake with fury. However, she was at a loss as for what to do.<br>&ldquo;World Spiritist Saintess, you shouldn&rsquo;t get angry. After all, little friend Chu Feng is not forcing you to do anything. It is up to you to decide what you choose to do,&rdquo; Elder Duan Chunchang said with a mischievous smile on his face. He had the fearless appearance of someone enjoying a show.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, an Ancestral Armament is not a small price. I am already being extremely charitable to be willing to give you an Ancestral Armament. I&rsquo;d suggest you to not refuse the face that is given to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you continue to insist on acting this shamelessly, I will definitely not leave this matter as-is,&rdquo; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors threatened Chu Feng fiercely as she gnashed her teeth angrily.<br>However, the smile Chu Feng had remained unchanged. He did not say anything, and just continued to look at her. He was waiting for her answer.<br>&ldquo;Enough of that. Don&rsquo;t bother with trying to threaten little friend Chu Feng. With your character, even if you didn&rsquo;t threaten him, we know that you would also not let little friend Chu Feng off. However, right now, you must still fulfill your promise. You should decide on what you plan to do,&rdquo; Elder Duan Chunchang said in a slightly impatient manner.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste everyone&rsquo;s time. Make your decision promptly,&rdquo; Grandmaster Prophet also urged impatiently.<br>At the same time, the others present also began to urge the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors.<br>Not a single person declared that Chu Feng was in the wrong. Rather, they were all declaring that the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother was in the wrong.<br>In such situation, an invisible pressure enveloped the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother. Even though she possessed an extremely thick skin and strong endurance, she was still unable to withstand the pressure.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Chu Feng, you win,&rdquo; The Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother came to a final decision. Although it was very painful for her to hand over her Stormwind Edge, she was unable to publicly kneel to Chu Feng.<br>Thus, she placed her hand into her clothes.<br>&ldquo;W-what are y-you doing? C-could it that y-you&rsquo;re trying to f-flash my brother? S-stop immediately! D-don&rsquo;t b-blind my eyes!&rdquo; Seeing this cene, Wang Qiang hurriedly covered his eyes and shouted with a frightened expression.<br>Wang Qiang&rsquo;s words caused the crowd to laugh out loud.<br>As for the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother, her eyes were blazing with fury. However, she did not stop her movement. When she took her hand from her clothes, a pearl-sized substance appeared in her hand.<br>&ldquo;That is a Cosmos Concealment Pearl. Could it be that she hid the Stormwind Edge in that pearl?&rdquo; Upon seeing that pearl, the crowd&rsquo;s eyes all shone.<br>Chu Feng had also heard of Cosmos Concealment Pearls before. They possessed the same function as Cosmos Sacks. However, the pearls were much smaller than Cosmos Sacks.<br>Furthermore, more importantly, Cosmos Concealment Pearls could be hidden within one&rsquo;s body. Furthermore, they would not bring any pain to their user and would fuse with one&rsquo;s body and become concealed once that entered the body. At that time, not even world spiritists would be able to detect them.<br>Thus, Cosmos Concealment Pearls were treasured objects used to store and conceal one&rsquo;s most valuable treasures.<br>Not mentioning what the Cosmos Concealment Pearls might be storing and hiding, merely the Cosmos Concealment Pearls themselves were extremely precious treasures.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a ray of light flashed out from that Cosmos Concealment Pearl. When the light bloomed, a sharp blade appeared in the hands of the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother.<br>It was an Ancestral Armament. Furthermore, it emitted a very powerful might the moment it appeared. Like the aura that a human ruler would emit, that Ancestral Armament also emitted a ruler-like aura that ordinary Ancestral Armaments could not be compared with.<br>When that Ancestral Armament appeared, not to mention Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, even the gazes of the people of the older generation present started to shine.<br>That Ancestral Armament had a crystalline appearance and was visibly transparent. It was seven and a half feet long. It appeared to be a blade, yet not a blade; a sword, yet not a sword. Faintly flickering golden veined patterns were present on the weapon. Those faintly flickering golden veined patterns gave rise to wind visible to the naked eye. Like whirlwinds, those winds surrounded the Ancestral Armament.<br>It was as if this Ancestral Armament were not a weapon, but rather a God of Wind that was capable of summoning powerful winds to do its bidding.<br>Most importantly, the aura emitted by this Ancestral Armament was stronger than that of ordinary Ancestral Armaments.<br>&ldquo;Stormwind Edge. Its fame is truly well deserved. It is truly a top quality weapon among Ancestral Armaments,&rdquo; At that moment, many of the bystanders began to praise the Stormwind Edge.<br>Hearing the praise from the crowd, the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors felt even more pained. Only she knew how many treasures she had used to purchase the Stormwind Edge. It could be said that she had exhausted half of all the treasures she had gathered in her lifetime in order to purchase this one Stormwind Edge.<br>However, for her own dignity, she had still chosen to hand the Stormwind Edge to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Have it,&rdquo; The Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother raised her hand and tossed the Stormwind Edge to Chu Feng.<br>Although she was extremely furious and itching to kill Chu Feng, she knew that she would not be able to kill him before all these experts. Thus, for the sake of her dignity, she had no choice but to toss her Stormwind Edge to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This is indeed a good weapon,&rdquo; Chu Feng examined the Stormwind Edge in his hand and revealed a delighted expression. Then, he carefully put it away. After that, he turned to the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother and said, &ldquo;Saintess is truly generous. My thanks.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo; Hearing what Chu Feng said, the expression of the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother changed once again. The reason for that was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s thanks was spoken as a very cutting remark; it was extremely anger-inducing.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, you said that you were able to undo this grand formation. Might you be willing to attempt to do so?&rdquo; Grandmaster Prophet said.<br>&ldquo;I have come precisely for the sake of these remnants. Thus, I will naturally give it a try. Merely, this Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit power is limited. I fear that I will have to borrow the strength of the seniors present to help me set up my spirit formation up,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to the Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists present.<br>&ldquo;Humph, and here I thought that you possessed heaven-defying abilities. Turns out that you still plan to rely on us,&rdquo; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors snorted coldly.<br>&ldquo;I am afraid that you will deliberately ruin my spirit formation. Thus, there is no need for your assistance,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a slight smile. Then, he looked to the other Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, &ldquo;Seniors, might you all be willing to assist me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little friend, you are being too courteous. Go ahead and tell us how you want us to help you,&rdquo; The Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists said to Chu Feng courteously. They clearly revealed their intentions to help Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You all actually really trust this brat? Utter foolery,&rdquo; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors mocked.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you do not believe in me. Since that&rsquo;s the case, how about the two of us have another gamble?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I am able to undo that grand formation using my spirit formation, you&rsquo;ll give me another Ancestral Armament. What do you think about that?&rdquo; Chu Feng said to the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo; Hearing those words, fury filled the heart of the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother. She nearly vomited blood in her anger.<br><br></p></div>
