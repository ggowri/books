        <h1>Chapter 3466</h1>
        <div> - Being Looked Down Upon<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It really is him? It really is him! Grandfather, did you see that? My future brother-in-law is amazing! He actually managed to replace Linghu Hongfei and ascended onto the most glorious Apex Pillar!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say that he&rsquo;s extraordinary? Merely, I didn&rsquo;t expect him to be so powerful!!!&rdquo;<br>Compared to the astonishment Gong Mingyue was feeling in her heart, Gong Qing reacted in a much more frantic manner. She was leaping around in great excitement.<br>&ldquo;Ah? Brother Gong, is he that Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Chu Feng, the one who has an engagement with your clan&rsquo;s Mingyue?&rdquo;<br>Hearing Gong Qing&rsquo;s words, the people around the Gong Heavenly Clan all turned to look at them.<br>Although the Gong Heavenly Clan was unqualified to enter the important guest region, they were located in a pretty decent region to view the competition. The people present in that region were all major powers in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm. Thus, they all knew one another.<br>Faced with the crowd&rsquo;s envirous gazes and desire for an answer, the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief merely smiled and nodded without saying anything.<br>&ldquo;It really is him? He&rsquo;s actually still alive?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly what is going on here? Wasn&rsquo;t it said that he had died long ago? Furthermore, wasn&rsquo;t it tested that he was someone without any talent for martial cultivation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the rumors are not reliable at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Gong, you&rsquo;re amazing. Back then, many people immediately broke off their arranged marriage upon discovering that Chu Feng was trash. Yet you insisted on keeping it. Your eyesight is truly exceptional.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the people that knew the Gong Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief began to voice all sorts of questions. Many people even began to look at him enviously.<br>Although they did not know how strong Chu Feng was, they all felt that he was an exceptional person to be able to obtain that honor. After all, one must obtain the acknowledgement of the Starfield Master Realm in order to inscribe one&rsquo;s name onto the Apex Pillars.<br>Faced with the crowd&rsquo;s envious gazes, the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief felt bitter pain in his heart.<br>The more dazzling Chu Feng was, the more pained he felt. After all, as matters stood, even he felt that the Chu Heavenly Clan would likely not recognize the engagement.<br>Most importantly, they were the ones to do wrong first. Even if the Chu Heavenly Clan refused to recognize the engagement, there was nothing they could do, as the one who broke off the engagement first was Gong Mingyue.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, that Chu Feng is actually nothing more than trash. His cultivation is extremely weak. He is only a rank one True Immortal. Someone like that is unable to match up to our young lady Mingyue.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation suddenly spoke.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Hearing that person&rsquo;s words, those people from the older generation immediately looked at him with skepticism.<br>They, people with status and power, would naturally not believe the words of a person from the younger generation. Thus, not only did they not believe him, but they even started to feel antipathy toward him.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, what I said is the truth. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, you can ask our Lord Clan Chief. Back then, our Lord Clan Chief had also personally witnessed it. That Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation is truly extremely weak,&rdquo; that person of the younger generation repeated.<br>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; The Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief shouted coldly. Then, he glared fiercely at that young man, who immediately realized that he had misspoken, and immediately shut his mouth.<br>&ldquo;Brother Gong, is that true?&rdquo; The crowd looked all looked to the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;One&rsquo;s current cultivation cannot determine one&rsquo;s future. Since young friend Chu Feng was able to obtain the Starfield Master Realm&rsquo;s acknowledgement, I believe there must be a reason for that,&rdquo; the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Although the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke in a very vague manner, the crowd all understood what he meant.<br>Indeed, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was very weak, being at only rank one True Immortal.<br>At that moment, the crowd turned their eyes to Chu Feng, who stood atop the Apex Pillar, and their expressions became complicated.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the old man with the writing brush waved his sleeve, and eleven pillars of light appeared.<br>These eleven pillars stood side by side in unison. Ten of the pillars stood before the ten Apex Pillars. The eleventh pillar appeared rather lonely, standing by itself.<br>After the light from the eleven pillars stopped radiating, they resembled transparent crystals. Although they were equally as tall as the Apex Pillars and were also erected from the ground, they were ten times thinner than the Apex Pillars.<br>&ldquo;Well then, before the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars officially begins, we shall start the tradition.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone, think things over carefully. If your selection is correct, you will end up making a huge profit,&rdquo; the old man laughed.<br>The crowd became endlessly excited. There were even people that took out a large amount of Immortal Martial Stones and began tossing them toward the crystal pillars.<br>The crystal pillars were like special vessels as they started to take in the Immortal Martial Stones that were tossed toward them.<br>&ldquo;Could this be a betting session?&rdquo; Chu Feng guessed after noticing this scene.<br>Seemingly knowing his confusion, a voice transmission entered his ears. It was Tantai Xing&rsquo;er&rsquo;s voice.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, that is indeed a betting session. It's a tradition in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Before the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars officially begins, everyone can select the person that they feel will be able to obtain first place in the competition.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for those crystal pillars, they are all formations capable of sensing the auras on the different Immortal Martial Stones. The winners of the gamble will be able to evenly divide the stake of the other participants according to the amount they bet.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The winners will be able to make a profit, whereas the losers will lose all their bets.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Originally, it was only a form of entertainment. However, in recent years, everyone has begun to make larger and larger bets,&rdquo; Tantai Xing&rsquo;er explained.<br>&ldquo;The ten pillars before us each represent us who stand on the Apex Pillars? That eleventh pillar represents the people that did not ascend onto the Apex Pillars?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Tantai Xing&rsquo;er using voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, that is precisely the case,&rdquo; Tantai Xing&rsquo;er replied.<br>&lsquo;Never would I expect that there would be such a thing on such a formal occasion. That said&hellip; this is quite interesting too,&rsquo; Chu Feng thought to himself.<br>&ldquo;However, I am not fond of this sort of thing. After all, I am a living person, and should not be used as a gambling tool by others. However, this is a method that the Starfield Master Realm has acknowledged. Thus, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do,&rdquo; said Tantai Xing&rsquo;er.<br>Chu Feng merely smiled at her words, and did not respond.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng was quite fond of this sort of gamble, as he felt that it was something that represented human nature. After all, should one invest in the gamble, one would not be a mere spectator, as the final result would concern their own interests. Because of that, one would become much more invested in the competition.<br>Chu Feng felt that this sort of gamble would make the competition much more interesting.<br>After all, a lot of people had put forth an enormous amount of Immortal Martial Stones. Many had bet several hundred thousand, or even several million Immortal Martial Stones.<br>One should know that ten thousand Immortal Martial Stones would be able to purchase an ordinary quality Immortal Armament.<br>From this, it could be seen that many people were truly betting an enormous amount.<br>However, none of those enormous bets were placed on Chu Feng&rsquo;s crystal pillar. The majority of them ended up in Linghu Yueyue, Linghu Tiemian and Tantai Xing&rsquo;er&rsquo;s crystal pillars.<br>There were also some enormous bets placed on Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s crystal pillar.<br>As for Chu Feng, his crystal pillar was rather pitiful, as there was simply no bet placed on him at all.<br>It seemed that, judging from the current situation, no one thought highly of Chu Feng's chances of winning the competition.<br></p></div>
