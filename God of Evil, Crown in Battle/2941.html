        <h1>Chapter 2940</h1>
        <div> - You Can Give It A Try<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Chu Xuanzhengfa's words were akin to the explosion of ten thousand bolts of lightning.<br>The thunder of his voice was very powerful, and shook all of heaven and earth.<br>That said, what was startled was not the crowd's ears. Instead, it was their hearts.<br>Without anyone explaining it to them, everyone understood what the name Chu Xuanyuan meant.<br>At that moment, countless eyes were focused on Chu Feng alone.<br>At the same time, the crowd also began to question in their hearts.<br>Was Chu Feng really Chu Xuanyuan's son?<br>Actually, everyone had suspected this before.<br>After all, Chu Xuanyuan's son's name was none other than Chu Feng. Chu Xuanyuan had also trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. Furthermore, even their appearances possessed a remarkable resemblance.<br>However, Chu Feng had never once declared himself to be Chu Xuanyuan's son.<br>Furthermore, rumor had it that Chu Feng had declared to others that he was not someone of the Chu Heavenly Clan, that he was not from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>Furthermore, there had been rumors that Chu Xuanyuan's son was already dead.<br>That was the reason why the crowd felt that all of this was a coincidence. Even if Chu Feng possessed an extraordinary origin, he should be unrelated to Chu Xuanyuan.<br>However, even Chu Xuanzhengfa was now saying that Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan's son. In that case, was Chu Feng really Chu Xuanyuan's son?<br>Faced with the seeking gazes of the crowd, Chu Feng felt somewhat distressed.<br>He would sooner or later have to admit that he was Chu Xuanyuan's son. Merely... he did not feel it to be the time yet. At the very least, he did not yet possess the strength to gain the Chu Heavenly Clan's acknowledgement.<br>"Chu Feng, go on and tell everyone the answer."<br>"Tell everyone your identity. Tell them that you're part of the Chu Heavenly Clan, that your father is Chu Xuanyuan."<br>"From now on, you will be protected by our Chu Heavenly Clan. No one will be able to injure you in the slightest again," Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>Actually, Chu Xuanzhengfa was looking forward to Chu Feng's answer too. As long as Chu Feng refused to say anything, even he could not be certain that Chu Feng was really Chu Xuanyuan's son.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was still hesistant, Her Lady Queen said, "Chu Feng, just admit to it. Right now, you need the power of the Chu Heavenly Clan to protect you."<br>Indeed, Chu Feng had offended many experts. If he did not admit to being Chu Xuanyuan's son, it would be equivalent to him not admitting that he was part of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Should that happen, Chu Feng would lose the protection of the Chu Heavenly Clan. Those people that wanted to kill him would become even more unbridled.<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, am indeed Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; finally, Chu Feng gave an answer to the crowd, and spoke of his identity.<br>Once he said those words, he immediately brought forth another grand commotion. Even though the crowd was prepared for this, they were still unable to contain their emotions when Chu Feng personally admitted to being Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son.<br>It turned out that Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son didn&rsquo;t die. Furthermore, he had inherited his father&rsquo;s Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique and talent.<br>&ldquo;No wonder Young Hero Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent is so heaven-defying. It turns out he&rsquo;s Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It's no wonder then, no wonder.&rdquo;<br>The crowd were in a complete uproar. Even Xia Yun&rsquo;er, who Chu Feng had known for quite some time, revealed a change in her expression.<br>It was for no other reason than because the name Chu Xuanyuan simply possessed too extraordinary of a significance.<br>Chu Xuanyuan was once the most powerful expert in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. He was the most outstanding genius to ever appear in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s history.<br>Even though many people did not dare to openly mention his name after what happened back then, Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s legends were still secretly being circulated.<br>This was especially true for Chu Xuanzhengfa. At that moment, a person like him actually had unconcealed joy in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;However, I, Chu Feng, am not a part of the Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng added.<br>&ldquo;Ah?!&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd&rsquo;s expression changed once again. They were extremely surprised.<br>What was Chu Feng talking about? He&rsquo;s saying he&rsquo;s not a part of the Chu Heavenly Clan?<br>He had already admitted to being Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son. Thus, how could he not be a part of the Chu Heavenly Clan?<br>Puzzled, someone said to Chu Feng in a joking manner, &ldquo;Young Hero Chu Feng, that joke of yours is not very funny.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is not a joke,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he pointed to his forehead.<br>After that, a burning brand appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead. It was a character.<br>The character read &lsquo;Trash!!!&rsquo;<br>[1. The character is &#24223; (Fei). It has a somewhat open meaning. It could mean discarded, deposed, exiled, wasted, etc. It is the same character used in the title of volume 7, Return of the Discarded Child. That said, I feel that one of the meanings of the character, waste/trash, would better suit Chu Feng&rsquo;s imprint. After all, he had been deemed trash with no talent. That said, the character would also imply that Chu Feng and his father were both exiled by the Chu Heavenly Clan.]<br>&ldquo;This!!!&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing the character &lsquo;Trash,&rsquo; many experts from the older generation were startled.<br>They knew what that character implied. It was a brand that the Chu Heavenly Clan placed on their clansmen&rsquo;s foreheads when they exiled them.<br>No, to be exact, it was a brand on their soul. It was a brand that could not be erased.<br>When Chu Feng left the Chu Heavenly Clan, he was only an infant. The Chu Heavenly Clan actually left that brand on his forehead at that time.<br>That was truly too excessive.<br>At that moment, the crowd&rsquo;s hearts began to shake nonstop. They were actually looking at Chu Feng with deep sympathy in their eyes.<br>They finally understood why Chu Feng refused to admit that he was someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it was indeed our clan that was in the wrong back then. However, we also possessed hidden troubles,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>&ldquo;Hidden troubles?&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed coldly. That was all that he said. However, those words were very mocking.<br>That&rsquo;s right, no matter how much hidden trouble they might have, there should be no reason for them to do that sort of thing to a child, much less an infant.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you not plan to return to the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t your father tell you to obtain the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s acknowledgement?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>She was actually worried for Chu Feng. The reason for that was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s current situation was truly bad. Her Lady Queen deeply hoped for Chu Feng to be able to return to the Chu Heavenly Clan. At the very least&hellip; she wanted him to utilize the protection offered by the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, it&rsquo;s impossible for me. I can become stronger and obtain the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s acknowledgement for the sake of finding out about my mother. However, I am unable to forgive them. It is impossible for me to forgive what they&rsquo;ve done to my father and I,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>As Chu Feng said those words, he started to clench his fists.<br>Just thinking about the scene of his father being banished by the Chu Heavenly Clan made Chu Feng feel as if his entire soul was burning. That sort of anger was truly unbearable.<br>Had it been others that did such a thing, Chu Feng would definitely kill them.<br>However, the ones that did such a thing were his own clansmen. Chu Feng could not willfully slaughter them.<br>This was what caused him to feel the greatest distress.<br>&ldquo;Very well, you can do whatever you want. This Queen will accompany you,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen was able to tell what Chu Feng was feeling. Thus, she decided to unconditionally support Chu Feng, and no longer attempted to advise him to return to the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Her Lady Queen was someone who only thought about Chu Feng&rsquo;s benefits. She only wanted Chu Feng to return to the Chu Heavenly Clan because she felt that he would be safer there. However, since Chu Feng was unwilling to do so, she would not attempt to urge him into doing it..<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the surrounding space around the Illusory Blood Lotus started to tremble. The next moment, the crimson fog started to dissipate. Following that, the Illusory Blood Lotus disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Immediately after the Illusory Blood Lotus disappeared, the experts from the younger generation, and even Martial Immortal-level experts like the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master and Elder Xingyi were unable to stand firm.<br>At that moment, the crowd all felt as if they had lost their balance, and were about to fall to the ground.<br>However, that sensation only lasted for an instant.<br>&ldquo;That is?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd were astonished to discover that there were two extremely ferocious martial powers before Chu Feng. They were currently confronting one another. Those two martial powers were simply too strong. Even space itself was being shattered by their collision, turning into black vortexes.<br>It was Yuwen Huazang and Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>It turned out that the tremble earlier was caused by these two Exalted-level experts.<br>However, the crowd only sensed the enormous power, and did not see the two Exalted-level experts unleashing their attacks.<br>At that moment, lingering fear covered the crowd&rsquo;s faces. Exalted-level experts were simply too frightening. Fortunately, the attack was aimed at Chu Feng. If it was aimed at them, they would likely not even know how they had died.<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanzhengfa, that Chu Feng has already denied that he&rsquo;s someone from your Chu Heavenly Clan. Yet you&rsquo;re still planning to protect him?&rdquo; Yuwen Huazang asked Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a meaningless question, no?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, what if I am to tell you that I insist on killing this Chu Feng today?&rdquo; Yuwen Huazang asked.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa smiled lightly. Then, an extremely cold expression emerged in his eyes. &ldquo;You can give it a try.&rdquo;<br><br><br></p></div>
