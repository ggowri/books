        <h1>Chapter 3792</h1>
        <div> - Hateful Gaze<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What a coincidence. Never would I have expected to encounter you two here,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right senior. This is truly a coincidence. I have been searching for you. However, never would I have expected that I would come across you here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Senior, why are you here?&rdquo; the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster asked.<br>&ldquo;That fellow told me to stay here and wait for him. He said that he&rsquo;d get his grandfather to teach me a lesson.&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed to the shivering Miao Yu, who stood behind him.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that you&rsquo;re his grandfather?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>&ldquo;Insolent disgrace!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster let out a furious shout.<br>Then, he pointed to Miao Yu and asked angrily, &ldquo;Miao Yu, are you saying that the person who beat you up is senior Asura?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&hellip; I&hellip; I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Miao Yu started to stutter in fear. At that moment, he was unable to even create a sentence.<br>&ldquo;Lord Headmaster, what is going on here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly who is this person?&rdquo;<br>As matters stood, Miao Yu&rsquo;s grandfather had realized that his grandson might have offended someone that he should not have, and courted a major disaster.<br>Even though he knew that his grandson was trash and useless scum, it remained that he was his grandson.<br>Thus, he wanted to defend his grandson if he could.<br>&ldquo;Supreme Elder, this person is that senior Asura my grandfather and I encountered. It is this senior who helped us breach that spirit formation, allowing us to obtain that Immortal Technique,&rdquo; Yang Shenshen said to Miao Yu&rsquo;s grandfather.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually this person?!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Miao Yu&rsquo;s grandfather realized that the situation was very bad.<br>Before Miao Yu had sought him out, the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster had been mentioning their encounter with Chu Feng to him.<br>From the way the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster praised Chu Feng, he knew that senior Asura was a peak expert. At the very least, his world spirit techniques were extremely powerful.<br>An expert of that caliber would be someone that anyone would want to entice. How could they possibly offend him instead?<br>However, his useless grandson had decided to offend exactly one such expert.<br>At that moment, Miao Yu&rsquo;s grandfather was truly furious. He was in such a rage that he wanted to whip his useless grandson to death.<br>Unfortunately, he was unable to do so. After all, he loved Miao Yu dearly.<br>No matter how useless he might be, no matter how much of a scum he was, he still loved him dearly.<br>If he hadn&rsquo;t pampered Miao Yu so excessively, Miao Yu would not have become so arrogant and despotic, stirring up trouble everywhere.<br>&ldquo;So you were senior Asura.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior Asura, exactly what happened here? Could there be some sort of misunderstanding?&rdquo; Miao Yu&rsquo;s grandfather arrived before Chu Feng and asked with a very mild and even slightly subservient manner.<br>Seeing the grandfather that he had always relied on being so courteous towards Chu Feng, Miao Yu fell powerlessly onto his butt.<br>He knew that he was done for. Completely done for.<br>Throughout the years, he was only able to be so arrogant and fearless because his grandfather had backed him up.<br>Never would he have imagined that he would actually end up provoking someone that could cause fear to even his grandfather.<br>He knew that he had truly kicked a plate of iron.<br>&ldquo;He must be your grandson, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng cast a glance at Miao Yu, who sat paralyzed on the ground.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct. That good-for-nothing is my grandson.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;May I know what he has done to have provoked senior? Senior, please tell me, and I will properly disciple him,&rdquo; said Miao Yu&rsquo;s grandfather.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually nothing serious. It&rsquo;s just that your grandson decided to forcibly drag my friend into his private room with the intention of seizing her body.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, I decided to stand up for my friend, and gave your grandson a slap to the face. After that, your grandson threatened me, saying that you&rsquo;re his grandfather.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He said that since you&rsquo;re his grandfather, practically no one in the entire Seven Suns Mountain Range region would dare to provoke him. Since I&rsquo;ve provoked him today, I&rsquo;ve committed a capital offense.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After that, he told me to wait for him here while he went and called you over to teach me a lesson.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng looked to the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that this fellow who commits all sorts of crimes and misdeeds is not only backed by his grandfather, but he&rsquo;s actually also backed by the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, I, Asura, have truly broadened my horizons.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Miao Yu turned completely ashen. In fact, even his grandfather&rsquo;s face turned ashen.<br>Although all the things Chu Feng had said were all true, he made it sound like Miao Yu&rsquo;s wicked deeds were things that could not be tolerated by the heavens. Furthermore, he also denounced the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster to be an accomplice of the evildoer Miao Yu.<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve all come, there&rsquo;s no need to continue standing there. Come, teach me a lesson.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng said to Miao Yu&rsquo;s grandfather and the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>&ldquo;Senior Asura, this is a misunderstanding, a total misunderstanding. Things are truly not as you think.&rdquo;<br>The Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster started to panic. He did not wish to leave such a bad impression on Chu Feng, and began to hurriedly explain things.<br>&ldquo;Misunderstanding. This is truly a misunderstanding.&rdquo;<br>Miao Yu&rsquo;s grandfather started sweating cold sweat from fear. Even his voice was no longer clear.<br>&ldquo;This is a misunderstanding? In that case, what is actually happening? Why don&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip; this&hellip; this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster was at a loss as to how to justify things, and landed himself in a dilemma.<br>After all, they had indeed made their way here with the intention of backing up Miao Yu. Merely, never had he ever imagined that the person they&rsquo;d planned to take care of was Chu Feng.<br>Suddenly, the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster exploded with anger. He pointed to Miao Yu&rsquo;s grandfather and asked furiously, &ldquo;Look at that good grandson you&rsquo;ve nurtured!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of everyone that he could offend, he actually offended senior Asura! Senior Asura is the great benefactor of our Watermirror Paradise!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tell me, what are we to do about what happened here today?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Headmaster, I&hellip; I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Miao Yu&rsquo;s grandfather found himself at a loss as to how to reply.<br>&ldquo;Exactly who is that guy?&rdquo;<br>Seeing both the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s Supreme Elder and headmaster being so terrified of Chu Feng, Luo Zhi and the others that were hiding and observing the situation all shivered in fear.<br>It was only at that moment that they realized that Chu Feng was a powerful individual.<br>They&rsquo;d finally realized why Song Ge would stick to Chu Feng the way she did.<br>It turned out that it wasn&rsquo;t that Song Ge was blind.<br>On the contrary, Song Ge knew that Chu Feng was powerful, and had decided to stick to him because of it.<br>Song Ge was much smarter than they were.<br>The foolish person was not Song Ge. Instead, they were the fools.<br>&ldquo;Damned Song Ge. I&rsquo;ve considered you to be my friend in vain. If you knew this Asura to be so powerful, why didn&rsquo;t you inform me sooner?&rdquo;<br>Wang Lian looked to Song Ge with complaint and even hatred in her eyes. She not only hated Song Ge, but she also hated herself.<br>Not only had she driven Chu Feng out of her home, but she had even mocked, ridiculed and cursed him out earlier. She had most definitely completely offended him.<br>She had actually offended such a powerful individual. Just thinking about it brought her lingering fear.<br>How could she not be afraid?<br></p></div>
