        <div> - Entering The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cave Again<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You all actually recognize this sword?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;How could we not? That&rsquo;s the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Monster Slaying Sword!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wait, why would you have the Monster Slaying Sword? Could it be&hellip; you&rsquo;ve received the inheritances?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Quickly, tell us how you obtained such a good treasure.&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints came to a sudden realization. Their eyes were all shining as they looked to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;ve received the inheritances.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng did not try to conceal things, and informed the Mystic Cave Saints of all the treasures he had obtained.<br>That included the gem that could potentially allow him to become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>He even told them about the location of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s real treasures. He even told them about the Great Monster Slaying Sword being the key to opening that tomb.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! What you&rsquo;ve told us is simply too shocking!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;His treasures are actually hidden in another tomb? As expected of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor, he&rsquo;s actually this meticulous with how he does things. Furthermore, one needs to be a Martial Exalted in order to open that tomb? The treasures inside that tomb must be extremely powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The real inheritance. That place is where the real inheritances are stored.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, truly, congratulations!&rdquo; the Mystic Cave Saints said to Chu Feng.<br>They were feeling very joyous. However, they were feeling joyous for his sake.<br>&ldquo;If you all are willing, we can go and open that tomb together," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No need, no need.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t. Absolutely don&rsquo;t do that. You should go on your own.&rdquo; the Mystic Cave Saints shook their heads repeatedly.<br>They actually opposed Chu Feng&rsquo;s proposal with determination.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Do you all not have the confidence in becoming Martial Exalted?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t even have such confidence, how are you supposed to avenge your ancestors?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that we don&rsquo;t have confidence. Instead, those inheritances belong to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right. The Great Monster Slayer Emperor was our benefactor. Since he deemed his successor to be you, everything in that tomb should be yours. We will not fight over them with you. We are also not qualified to fight over them with you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, since that gem is now inside you, you&rsquo;ll be the only one that&rsquo;ll be able to use it. I know that you might be feeling somewhat ashamed. After all, our purpose in coming to the tomb was to obtain that gem.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you actually do not have to feel that way. After all, we&rsquo;ve gained something even more important,&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Something even more important? What is that?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You. We&rsquo;ve gained another brother,&rdquo; the Mystic Cave Saints opened their large mouths and spoke with smiles all over their faces.<br>&ldquo;Haha. If you say it like that, I&rsquo;ve also gained another brother.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, not one brother, but eleven brothers,&rdquo; Chu Feng also smiled.<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints made arrangements to proceed for the All-heaven Sect together in two months&rsquo; time.<br>Even though Chu Feng was qualified to enter that treasure&rsquo;s space because he was a person of the younger generation, experts from the All-heaven Sect and five other starfields would all be present when the treasure was opened.<br>Thus, they must make sure that things would go absolutely perfectly.<br>The difficulty this time around would be much more difficult than entering the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb before the All-heaven Sect.<br>After all, they were planning to plunder the treasure right before the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster and the overlords of five starfields.<br>Once they did that, Chu Feng would not only have offended the All-heaven Sect alone. Instead, he would have offended the other five starfields too.<br>However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng was still determined to do it.<br>It was not only because the All-heaven Sect was his enemy. Instead, Chu Feng wanted to know exactly what sort of treasure could make the All-heaven Sect and the five other starfields place such high importance on it.<br>The Mystic Cave Saints actually already had a plan in mind.<br>They merely needed to act together in two months&rsquo; time. Chu Feng did not have to worry about anything else, as the Mystic Cave Saints would handle the rest.<br>After deciding on the matter, Chu Feng informed the Mystic Cave Saints of what he planned to do next.<br>Chu Feng wanted to enter the cave below the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb, the place with the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms.<br>&ldquo;What? You want to enter that cave with the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms? Have you gone mad?&rdquo;<br>The expressions of the Mystic Cave Saints changed enormously upon learning about it. They felt it completely unbelievable, and were all looking at Chu Feng like he was a fool.<br>After all, all of them had personally experienced how terrifyingly dangerous that cave was.<br>Even imagining it at that moment brought them lingering fear.<br>With the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; confused gazes upon him, Chu Feng spoke of his intention.<br>Chu Feng told them about the mural that greatly resembled Yan Ruyu.<br>&ldquo;Thus, you want to utilize the power of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb&rsquo;s spirit formation to find out the truth about your friend?&rdquo; asked the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Mn. I do not wish to miss this opportunity,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that even if the eleven of us brothers are to attempt to dissuade you until our lips are chapped, we will not be able to do so right?&rdquo; asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Haha. That seems to be the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a laugh.<br>The Mystic Cave Saints sighed. &ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, I can only urge you to be careful. We brothers will still be waiting for you to join us in two months so that we can go and cause havoc in the All-heaven Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rest assured. How could I, Chu Feng, possibly miss out on something like that?&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a look of confidence.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, take this. It might be of use to you,&rdquo; the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints tossed a case to Chu Feng as he spoke.<br>Chu Feng opened the case and discovered that there was an insect inside.<br>That insect was very small -- only the size of a grain of rice.<br>However, it looked very disgusting. It was simply the most disgusting insect that Chu Feng had ever seen.<br>That insect was actually emitting the aura of the Ancient Era. It was an insect from the Ancient Era.<br>&ldquo;This insect comes from the Ancient Era. To us, it does not have any effect. In fact, it will immediately die should it enter our bodies.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if it is to enter the body of an Ancient Era&rsquo;s organism, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organism will momentarily lose control of itself. Like a doll, it will be controlled by you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps this insect will be able to help you in finding out the whereabouts of your friend once you&rsquo;re down there,&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt rather moved. He was firstly moved by the numerous amount of treasures the Mystic Cave Saints possessed. There were simply all kinds of treasures.<br>They were truly worthy of being known as mobile treasuries.<br>At the same time, Chu Feng felt moved by how much they were willing to help him.<br>After deciding, Chu Feng used the power of the tomb&rsquo;s spirit formation to teleport the Mystic Cave Saints to somewhere safe.<br>As for him, he entered the cave with the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms.<br>Earlier, Chu Feng was unable to enter that cave. In fact, he could not even examine the cave with his consciousness.<br>However, now that he had obtained the complete power of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb, he was able to directly enter the cave where the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms were.<br>After arriving in the cave again, Chu Feng still felt very uneasy.<br>Even though the power of the spirit formation had enveloped his body, Chu Feng still felt no sense of security being whilst he was there.<br>That said, with the spirit formation&rsquo;s power, Chu Feng would be able to escape at any time should he discover danger.<br>Thus, Chu Feng was able to protect himself.<br>That said, even with that being the case, he was still extremely careful as he traveled through the cave. He did not dare to show the slightest amount of carelessness.<br>The reason for that was because the impression those Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms had left on him was simply too enormous.<br>However, Chu Feng had only entered the cave for a short while before he discovered that the cave had changed.<br>He no longer heard those terrifying howls. He no longer felt any terrifying energy ripples. In fact, he couldn&rsquo;t sense any dangerous aura at all.<br>As Chu Feng walked, he discovered many enormous remains.<br>Those remains should all have been freshly killed.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what is going on here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did someone decide to hunt them like prey? Or were they killed by another Ancient Era&rsquo;s organism?&rdquo;<br>Although Chu Feng had no idea exactly what had happened, he was able to make rough guesses.<br>The battle that had occurred earlier should have been a massacre. The remains of those giant monsters showed who the targets of that massacre were.<br>But, why did they massacre them? Furthermore, who massacred them? Chu Feng still had no idea.<br>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s here?!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed. He sensed that there were many people rapidly approaching his location.<br></p></div>
