        <div> - Mother&rsquo;s Bloodline<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;This spirit power, how could it be this strong?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Li Yue&rsquo;er had an astonished expression on her face.<br>She felt that even if Chu Feng&rsquo;s stamina and spirit power weren&rsquo;t completely exhausted, even if his state of being was the same as before, he would not possess such overwhelming spirit power.<br>Although this burst of spirit power was still Immortal-level spirit power, the sensation that she felt from it had already surpassed that of Immortal-level spirit power.<br>It was an extremely pure and grand spirit power.<br>If spirit power of the same level possessed a class difference, then the spirit power that Chu Feng emitted right now would be the noble among nobles, the king among kings.<br>Finally, the spirit power that rushed forth like a volcanic eruption from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body started to gradually vanish.<br>As Chu Feng&rsquo;s overwhelming spirit power vanished, Li Yue&rsquo;er immediately revealed an overjoyed expression.<br>The reason for that was because the Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler was right before Chu Feng. However, the aura that it emitted was completely different from before.<br>It was no longer a lump of scrap metal. Instead, it was emitting intense Immortal-level martial power. It had become an Incomplete Immortal Armament.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve succeeded. You managed to successfully refine an Incomplete Immortal Armament!&rdquo; At that moment, Her Lady Queen was also overjoyed.<br>One must know that Chu Feng was on the verge of dying earlier. There was a very high chance that he could have died.<br>However, in the end, he had succeeded. This sort of success was simply too difficult. As such, how could Her Lady Queen not feel joy?<br>&ldquo;Its appearance is a bit ugly. Before fusing the Grand Weaponry Refinement Formation with it, I should&rsquo;ve fixed its appearance. However, I was so anxious on fusing them that I decided to not bother with its appearance for the sake of saving my spirit power,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a light laugh.<br>The Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler was indeed a bit ugly. Although it now had a sword hilt that Chu Feng could hold onto, its appearance was still that of a block of metal.<br>Most importantly, it was even uglier than before it went through the whole weaponry refinement process. Due to Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s mistake, the Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler now had many cracks. It made it resemble a shattered iron block.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that it was emitting Immortal-level martial power, no one would think that it was an Incomplete Immortal Armament.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault. If I had been able to hold on, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been like this,&rdquo; said Li Yue&rsquo;er with self-blame.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. Didn&rsquo;t we still succeed? If it hadn&rsquo;t been for you, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to persist either. Refining an Incomplete Immortal Armament is simply too hard,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what was that spirit power you emitted earlier?&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er asked.<br>Li Yue&rsquo;er was not someone fond of meddling in others&rsquo; business. However, she was truly too curious as to what happened earlier.<br>The reason for that was because the spirit power Chu Feng had emitted earlier gave her a sensation that she had never felt before.<br>It she had to describe it, then it was a sensation of a ruler overlooking the world.<br>As a fellow world spiritist, she wanted to know exactly where Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power came from.<br>&ldquo;Earlier? Was there something different about it?&rdquo; Chu Feng was confused by Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s question.<br>Earlier, he had merely felt that boundless spirit power had emerged from his dried up body.<br>Thus, he used that spirit power to operate the Grand Weaponry Refinement Formation. Apart from that, he didn&rsquo;t do anything different.<br>&ldquo;It was completely different,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, your spirit power earlier was simply frighteningly powerful,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>With a thought, Chu Feng unleashed his spirit power from his body.<br>&ldquo;No, this is not the same spirit power you used earlier,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er shook her head.<br>The spirit power Chu Feng unleashed this time around was the same as the spirit power that he always had. Although it was still Immortal-level spirit power, it simply did not possess the majestic grandeur of a ruler overlooking the world like earlier.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on. This is the spirit power that I can unleash,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Chu Feng did not know what sort of spirit power he had managed to unleash earlier to astonish Li Yue&rsquo;er and Her Lady Queen like that.<br>However&hellip; this was the sort of spirit power that he could unleash at that moment. It was the same as it had always been.<br>Hearing such a response from Chu Feng, Li Yue&rsquo;er stopped inquiring further. She felt that Chu Feng was not lying to her, and would most likely not lie to her.<br>&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t know what happened? Why would you burst out with such a powerful spirit power for no reason at all?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;Was it really that powerful?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>As that matter was, after all, something that had happened to him, Chu Feng was also very curious.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wrong to say that it was powerful. After all, it was still Immortal-level spirit power. However, the feeling was completely different. Regardless, it was very powerful,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, did you not see what I saw earlier?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;What? What did you see?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;It seems that you didn&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what did you see? Tell me. You damned bastard, don&rsquo;t tease this Queen, okay? Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me&hellip;&rdquo; Her Lady Queen urged with incomparable curiosity.<br>&ldquo;I seemed to have seen my mother,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Mother? What is going on? Where did you see her? Your mother came to find you?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen grew even more curious upon hearing that.<br>&ldquo;It should be from when I was an infant. That sensation seemed more like a memory,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Did you manage to awaken some sort of power after seeing your mother? That&rsquo;s very possible. After all, your mother&rsquo;s world spirit techniques were extremely powerful. You should have inherited her bloodline and talent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely&hellip; it&rsquo;s possible that your bloodline and power have not awakened completely yet. As for earlier&hellip; it was awakened after you recalled the memory of your mother.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although it only managed to awaken for an instant, it is very likely that such was the case earlier,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen analyzed.<br>&ldquo;It might be it,&rdquo; Chu Feng did not dare to be certain of anything. He was only concerned with completing the Incomplete Immortal Armament earlier, and had truly not paid attention to his spirit power.<br>&ldquo;It would be truly great if that is the case.&rdquo;<br>Her Lady Queen was overjoyed. She had felt Chu Feng&rsquo;s enormous spirit power. Because of how extraordinary that spirit power was, Her Lady Queen hoped that Chu Feng would continue to have that spirit power in the future.<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Chu Feng, what does your mother look like? As long as you know her appearance, you will be able to go and find her in the future,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t able to see it clearly. However, I feel like my mother must be a great beauty,&rdquo; Chu Feng said confidently. Although he had only managed to see a vague image, Chu Feng felt that his mother possessed a lot of class, and was a great beauty.<br>That was understandable. Likely, to everyone, their mother would be a very beautiful person.<br>&ldquo;However&hellip; I remember her voice. It was extremely gentle,&rdquo; Chu Feng felt a great amount of warmth as he recalled that voice.<br>Chu Feng felt intoxicated with that sensation of warmth. He did not want to let go of it.<br>He felt that perhaps this was the feeling of motherly love.<br>&ldquo;It is truly a pity that you didn&rsquo;t manage to see her appearance clearly. However, being able to hear her voice should be a very happy thing for you, no?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>Being with Chu Feng for so long, Her Lady Queen knew very well how much Chu Feng wanted to see his mother.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded. He was still remembering the scene that he had seen.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Chu Feng,&rdquo; Right at that moment, Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s voice suddenly sounded.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you? I&rsquo;m asking you a question, why aren&rsquo;t you answering me?&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng felt embarrassed. He was immersed in his memory, and had forgotten where he was. He had actually failed to hear Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s voice.<br>&ldquo;You might be overly exhausted. Take a seat and have some rest,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;Girl, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about me. You should take care of yourself first,&rdquo; Chu Feng supported Li Yue&rsquo;er with his arms and brought her to a seat.<br>Then, he began to set up a spirit formation to help her recover her spirit power.<br>Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face was deathly pale. Her clothes were soaked with sweat. Even though she was a powerful little chili hot pepper, she currently resembled a weak woman, powerless to even truss a chicken.<br>Chu Feng felt very bad about it. If it wasn&rsquo;t for helping him with his weaponry refinement, Li Yue&rsquo;er would not have exhausted herself to such a state.<br>&ldquo;Stop, your situation is worse than mine,&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng was actually helping her recover her spirit power, Li Yue&rsquo;er immediately urged him to stop.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, I am fine,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled and continued to help Li Yue&rsquo;er recover.<br>After a short period of time, Li Yue&rsquo;er managed to recover a lot. Although her complexion was still pale, she was at least spirited.<br>As for Chu Feng, he appeared to be completely fine. Compared to when they were still operating the Grand Weaponry Refinement Formation, Chu Feng looked like a completely different person.<br>&ldquo;How could you suddenly recover this quickly?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that there is some sort of hidden power within you?&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er was still curious.<br>She knew very well that Chu Feng&rsquo;s recovery should be related to that overwhelming spirit power.<br>Ever since that spirit power emerged, Chu Feng became incomparably spirited. It was as if he had been reborn.<br>If Chu Feng had no idea what was going on still, then there could only be one possibility to explain it. That is, there was still a hidden power within Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. That power was something that Chu Feng possessed no knowledge of, and did not know how to utilize.<br>&ldquo;That would be great if that is the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled. Then, he said to Li Yue&rsquo;er, &ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s right, what is it that you wanted to ask me earlier?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I wanted to ask you how much progress you&rsquo;ve managed to obtain from this weaponry refinement?&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er asked.<br><br></p></div>
