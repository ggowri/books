        <h1>Chapter 5606: Immortal Slaughterer’s Member</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why are you crying? I haven&rsquo;t even hurt you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why am I useless? How can I be so useless? Damn it! I actually gave Xiaoxiao away to you just like that!&rdquo; Qin Hang was so frustrated that he took back his spear and flipped it on himself. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of living if I can&rsquo;t be with Xiaoxiao in the future?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pushed the spear toward his own dantian, intending to cripple himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pah!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the spear suddenly stalled to a halt. Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand had stopped the spear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re free to fancy Xiaoxiao. That&rsquo;s how you feel, and no one can tell you otherwise. However, you shouldn&rsquo;t have made such a bet. Xiaoxiao is not a thing; she has the right to decide whom she wants to associate with,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&hellip; You&hellip; Chu Feng, could it be that&hellip;&rdquo; Qin Hang stared at Chu Feng in disbelief. He didn&rsquo;t expect there to be a way out of this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Whether you like Xiaoxiao or not is your business; I won&rsquo;t interfere. However, Xiaoxiao has the right to decide who she wants to be with. I hope that you won&rsquo;t do anything to put her in a spot or, worse, hurt her. I won&rsquo;t let you off if you dare hurt her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Hang&rsquo;s lips quivered even more. He suddenly grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands and exclaimed, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re a saint! I was wrong. From now on, you&rsquo;re my good friend. Let me know if anyone dares to touch you&mdash;I&rsquo;ll massacre his clan!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Hang cried as he said those words, but those were tears of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng shook off Qin Hang&rsquo;s hands and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to venture deeper into this remnant. Do you want to travel with me?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Can I? Are you willing to travel with me even after what I did? Chu Feng, how can there be someone as kind as you in this world?! What luck is it for me to be able to become friends with someone like you?&rdquo; Qin Hang cried with warm tears brimming in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng even noticed a hint of affection in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Cut the crap and come with me! Also, I don&rsquo;t want you to ever look at me with those eyes ever again. I have no interest in men!&rdquo; Chu Feng said. He shattered Qin Hang&rsquo;s barrier and marched ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Rest assured, I am also fond of women. From this day onward, you&rsquo;ll be my brother!&rdquo; Qin Hang first wiped his tears before quickly following Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, he&rsquo;s your potential love rival! It&rsquo;s one thing for you to spare him, but why are you treating him so well?&rdquo; Eggy asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;A bet wouldn&rsquo;t change his feelings for Xiaoxiao. I didn&rsquo;t hold it against him because I realized that he is an innocent person even though he put on airs as the young master of a powerhouse. Besides, his feelings for Xiaoxiao are the real deal. He really intended to cripple his cultivation back then after losing to me. It wasn&rsquo;t just an act. This shows that he truly values this bet. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a bad thing for XIaoxiao to </span><span>have such a suitor,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that just make him a bigger threat to you?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How is he a threat? I have no feelings for Xiaoxiao. We&rsquo;re just friends. I wish the best for her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Long Xiaoxiao is a wonderful woman. It&rsquo;s a huge waste for you to give her up to someone else just like that. Listen to my advice and keep her for yourself,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let Xiaoxiao slip past my fingers if I truly harbor feelings for her, but it would be unfair for me to forcefully keep her by my side if I don&rsquo;t fancy her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Fine, I can&rsquo;t argue against you,&rdquo; Eggy grumbled in annoyance. &ldquo;Anyway, I have made my stance clear. It&rsquo;d be best if you can keep good ladies like Long Xiaoxiao, Xian Miaomiao, and Little Fishy by your side. You&rsquo;ll regret it if you let them slip past you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eggy prioritized Chu Feng over all things, so she thought that he was entitled to all things in the world, including women. However, Chu Feng thought differently. He wanted his good friends to find true happiness for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were discussing this matter, a spirit formation gate appeared in front. Chu Feng and Qin Hang walked through it, and they were transported into a vast forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng quickly looked back and saw that the spirit formation gate he had entered fromwas nowhere to be seen. Qin Hang, who was supposed to be by his side, had also vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Another formation that randomly transports us elsewhere?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured, knowing that Qin Hang had been teleported elsewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shockwave suddenly rippled in the distance, indicating that there was a fight between Half-God level cultivators there. This suggested that there might be treasures in the vicinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Chu Feng quickly made his way over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon arriving, he saw that of the two battling cultivators, one of them being a young man and the other one being an old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man was emaciated, and he was dressed in black robes that contrasted sharply with his ghastly pale complexion. He had huge eyebags reminiscent of a panda, but his pupils were crimson. There was no doubt that he was a human, but he resembled a monstrous beast more. Despite his young appearance, Chu Feng could tell from his aura that he was over a hundred years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man was extremely strong. By raising his cultivation ranks twice, his strength was now comparable to a rank six Half-God level cultivator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coincidentally, the old man fighting with the young man was a familiar face to Chu Feng. It was the clan chief whose affairs Chu Feng had interfered with, and he eventually swiped from the latter a copper mirror that allowed him to check if a cultivator had a protective formation or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them were fighting each other over a floating light bundle that contained a token inscribed with the words &lsquo;Immortal Region&rsquo;. It was clear that the token would play a pivotal role later on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man had already fallen into a disadvantageous position by the time Chu Feng arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It just so happens that I can try this mirror,&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured as he took out the copper mirror and aimed it at the young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man&rsquo;s reflection shone with a brilliant light, indicating that he had a powerful protective formation that even pinnacle Half-God level cultivators would struggle to breach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like he has a powerful background,&rdquo; Chu Feng thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the young man suddenly executed a powerful martial skill. Countless martial daggers pierced through the old man&rsquo;s body, and the latter collapsed in pain amidst splattering blood. There was a huge gap in their fighting prowess even though the two of them were currently at the same cultivation level. The old man was clearly not a match for the young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young her, I&rsquo;ll give this token to you,&rdquo; the old man pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Old thing, do I look like an easy person? Who do you think you are? You&rsquo;re already dead meat from the moment you chose to fight with me!&rdquo; the young man sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his arm and shot out another martial power dagger aimed at the old man&rsquo;s neck, intending to decapitate the latter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dagger was deflected before it severed the old man&rsquo;s neck. The old man was surprised, as he had already mentally prepared himself for death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He has already admitted defeat. There&rsquo;s no need for you to go so far,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young hero! It&rsquo;s you, young hero! Save me! I don&rsquo;t want to die!&rdquo; The old man&rsquo;s eyes lit up as if he had seen his savior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man sensed that Chu Feng was not an easy opponent, so he didn&rsquo;t rush to make a move. He took his time assessing Chu Feng as he asked, &ldquo;Are you friends with him?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man&rsquo;s face paled as he anxiously cried out, &ldquo;Y-young hero, please save me! I&rsquo;m begging you! Hai&rsquo;er and Qiang&rsquo;er will die as well if I die here!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words made Chu Feng laugh. &ldquo;Did I neglect to tell you that the link only goes one way? You&rsquo;d lose your life if they died, but your death wouldn&rsquo;t hurt them at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; The old man&rsquo;s face stiffened up. He didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You should hurry along if you aren&rsquo;t close to him. Don&rsquo;t be a busybody,&rdquo; the young man said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I might not be close to him, but I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a need for you to kill him,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you going to butt into this matter? You shouldn&rsquo;t court trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we do this? You spare him, and I won&rsquo;t fight with you over that token.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo; The young man suddenly burst into laughter. He looked at Chu Feng with murderous eyes as he said, &ldquo;Brat, you must not know who I am to dare vie for my token! I&rsquo;ll let you know that my master is the Number 2 of the Immortal Slaughterer!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s face immediately darkened. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man didn&rsquo;t notice the change in Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression. He took out a </span><span>token and proudly declared, &ldquo;My master is the Number 2 of the most powerful assassination organization of the world of cultivation, the Immortal Slaughterer! I am a member of the Immortal Slaughterer too. You should think twice before provoking me!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inscribed on the token were the words &lsquo;Immortal Slaughterer&rsquo;.</span></p></div>
