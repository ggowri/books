        <div> - Conflict And Distrust<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior.&rdquo;<br>At the moment when Gu Mingyuan had a worried look on her face, a voice sounded from afar.<br>It was Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice!!!<br>After the voice was heard, Gu Mingyuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu simply did not dare to believe their ears.<br>That said, they still involuntarily turned in the direction of Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice.<br>Once they turned, their expressions both turned brilliant.<br>There were three figures rapidly flying toward them from afar.<br>Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa were not the only ones present; there was also another person. That person was someone that both Gu Mingyuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu knew. He was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Led by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa discovered the exit to leave the sea. Once they exited, they immediately went searching for Gu Mingyuan and the others.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, the two of you&hellip; actually managed to come out?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How did you manage to come out?&rdquo;<br>Gu Mingyuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu went up to greet them. Seeing that both Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa were fine, they were both extremely excited and curious.<br>As for Chu Feng, his gaze landed on Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;The Deepsea Pupils fused successfully?&rdquo; he asked.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still some time needed for them to be fused completely, However, her condition has stabilized,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s truly great,&rdquo; hearing those words, Chu Feng felt very relieved.<br>They had done so much and braved all those risks so that they could help Chu Lingxi.<br>Now that he had confirmed that Chu Lingxi could be cured, Chu Feng felt that all the pain and suffering he went through was worth it.<br>Gu Mingyuan cast a glance at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist as she asked, &ldquo;Chu Feng, how did you all manage to come out? Furthermore&hellip; why would you be together with this Ox-nose?&rdquo;<br>There was slight hostility in her gaze. Gu Mingyuan seemed to greatly dislike the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;This senior is the one who brought us out,&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;He brought you two out???&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu narrowed his eyes upon hearing those words. Suspicion filled his eyes. He directly turned to ask the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Liangqiu, why are you asking this sort of question? Why can&rsquo;t I be here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is I who brought the two of them out from that Gate of Death. Not only are you all not thanking me, but you&rsquo;re instead questioning me like a criminal?&rdquo;<br>Although the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said that, he was not angered by Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s attitude. Instead, he had a beaming smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;How could someone like you possibly be able to bring Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa out from the Gate of Death?&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan said. Like Grandmaster Liangqiu, she was not at all confident in the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you believe me or not. You can go and ask Chu Feng, they can testify for me,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;It is indeed this senior who brought us out,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, princess of the Ancient Clan, that is indeed the case.&rdquo;<br>Even Chu Xuanzhengfa spoke to testify for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, young friend Chu Xuanzhengfa, the two of you were deceived by him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could he possibly be capable of leading you two out from the Gate of Death?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why the two of you were able to remain safe is all thanks to brother Zhu,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng wanted to explain. After all, it was indeed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist that had led them to the exit.<br>However, before he could finish his words, Grandmaster Liangqiu said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you don&rsquo;t have to try explaining for him. You must&rsquo;ve been deceived by him. I know him too well.&rdquo;<br>After Grandmaster Liangqiu finished saying those words, Gu Mingyuan added, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re not experienced enough, and still don&rsquo;t know what sort of person this Ox-nose is. It is all thanks to senior Zhu that the two of you were able to escape.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the way Grandmaster Liangqiu and Gu Mingyuan were acting, Chu Feng knew that they must possess a very deep misunderstanding with the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Perhaps it would be impossible for him to explain things at that moment. Thus, Chu Feng did not attempt to bother explaining things, and instead asked, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right, where&rsquo;s senior Zhu?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After senior Zhu learned that the two of you had entered the Gate of Death, he decided to help you two escape from your predicament.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, he proceeded to the Mirror Core,&rdquo; said Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;Mirror Core? What sort of place is that?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;A lot of the powers in the Mirror Sea originate from spirit formations. Since there are spirit formations, there are naturally formation cores.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Mirror Core is the formation core of the Mirror Sea.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Zhu was unable to enter the Gate of Death and bring the two of you out. Thus, he could only enter the Mirror Core and use its power to weaken the power of the Mirror Sea.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He entered the Mirror Core roughly four hours after the two of you entered the Gate of Death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right, did the two of you feel anything?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Four hours, was it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly how much time has passed. That region was simply too strange. After some time, it would let out a strange bell sound.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After the bell tolled, the power of the sea would strengthen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Later on, due to being unable to withstand the power, my consciousness began to grow fuzzy, and I was no longer able to determine time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, for some unknown reason, that enormous oppressive power suddenly disappeared.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, since senior Zhu decided to help us, it&rsquo;s very possible that the disappearance of that power was due to his actions,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That must be the case,&rdquo; compared to Chu Feng, Grandmaster Liangqiu was extremely certain.<br>It could be seen that, different from the way he acted towards the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Grandmaster LIangqiu was filled with confidence in old man Zhu.<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Senior, you said that you stayed in that region for such a long time, do you know what the deal is with that strange bell?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, how are you able to withstand that enormous power?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Chu Feng firmly believe that even Gu Mingyuan would not be able to withstand that terrifying power if she had entered that sea region.<br>Logically, it would be even more impossible for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to be able to withstand that terrifying power if he had stayed there for many years.<br>&ldquo;you two were trapped above the rocks. The bell of death tolls there. The more you hear that bell, the more power you&rsquo;ll end up having to withstand. It will continue till your death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for me, I was below the rocks. There is no bell of death below the rocks.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The bell of death above the rocks will not disappear without cause. To be able to make the bell of death above the rocks disappear and also enter the Mirror Sea, that person is quite capable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, exactly who is that so-called senior Zhu?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Ox-nose, also wish to know a person that extraordinary,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;That person is my friend. However, I believe that he would not want to know someone like you.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s words were filled with condescension. It could be seen that he was truly not fond of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not necessarily so. Who knows, maybe he and I are kindred spirits,&rdquo; faced with Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s cutting remarks, Ox-nosed Old Daoist was not only not affected at all, but he even had a look of expectation.<br>It could be seen that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist truly had very thick skin.<br>That said, at this moment, Chu Feng was more curious as to what exactly happened between Grandmaster Liangqiu and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist for there to be such conflict and distrust between them.<br></p></div>
