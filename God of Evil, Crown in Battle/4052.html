        <h1>Chapter 4051</h1>
        <div> - Smash To Pieces<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, stop!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, someone shouted Chu Feng&rsquo;s name whilst weeping.<br>It turned out it was Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo.<br>When the majority of the Wuming Clansmen had opened up a path for Chu Feng because they were afraid of being killed, Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo actually threw themselves onto Wuming Doutian, shielding him behind them.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, we beg of you, do not kill our father.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, we beg of you. He has already taken three forbidden medicines in succession. Even if he&rsquo;s able to survive, he will definitely not be a threat to you anymore. Please, please spare him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, we beg of you. We know that we&rsquo;re not qualified to beg you, but still, we must beg you. Please, please take into consideration that we&rsquo;ve fought alongside one another and spare our father.&rdquo;<br>Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo were begging Chu Feng and weeping tears.<br>Seeing such a thing, Chu Feng hesitated.<br>After all, he could be said to be friends with Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo.<br>If he were to truly kill Wuming Doutian, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that he would&rsquo;ve killed his friends&rsquo; father?<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I beg you too, please spare Lord Realm Master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if our Wuming Clan was in the wrong back then, we did not eradicate your Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, another voice sounded. It was Wuming Fenghuo.<br>Wuming Fenghuo was someone that had helped Chu Feng in the past. He could even be said to be a benefactor who had saved his life.<br>After he spoke, the situation became even more difficult for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what Lord Wuming Fenghuo said is correct. Whilst the Wuming Clan had forced your grandfather to flee, oppressed your father and your Chu Heavenly Clan, they did not attempt to eradicate us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If they had, our Chu Heavenly Clan wouldn&rsquo;t have survived untill now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besies, not all of the Wuming Clansmen are tyrannical and despotic people.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is better to squash enmity rather than keep it alive. Perhaps you should spare them.&rdquo;<br>A voice transmission had suddenly entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears. It was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>After all those people had pleaded with him to spare Wuming Doutian, it would be a lie to say that Chu Feng was not moved by their words.<br>Suddenly, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath.<br>When he opened his eyes again, the hesitation had disappeared from within them.<br>&ldquo;Wuming Doutian, I actually understand you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Wuming Doutian was confused.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a truly despicable man.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is no wonder you were afraid of my grandfather and my father. I can understand your fear.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With your limited talent and your ambition, you would naturally not permit anyone to threaten your status,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>He was insulting Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Wuming Doutian chuckled after hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;As matters stand, I&rsquo;m not going to lie. It&rsquo;s true that I, Wuming Doutian, am not a straightforward and upright individual.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For the sake of achieving my goals, I have acted unscrupulously. However, this is how the martial cultivation world is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The victor is king, and the losers are denounced as bandits. Today, I&rsquo;ve lost. Thus, I will not argue.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you want to kill me, go ahead and kill me. I know you will not let me live.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, if I were able to kill your father and grandfather back then, I wouldn&rsquo;t have let them live either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come, kill me. If you want to settle the grievances of the past, then come settle them.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Wuming Doutian closed his eyes.<br>He was prepared to die.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Wuming Doutian screamed in pain.<br>Then, he began to struggle violently.<br>It turned out, it was his body. His body was rapidly ulcerating.<br>It was the corrosion caused by the three gaseous flames.<br>It was the backlash from taking the three forbidden medicines.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>His screams were so miserable, so tragic.<br>The crowd were simply unable to imagine exactly what sort of pain he was suffering from at that moment.<br>Just thinking about the pain caused them to feel their scalps go numb.<br>&ldquo;Father, father!&rdquo;<br>Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo hugged Wuming Doutian and began to weep bitter tears.<br>At that moment, Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s other children also rushed over.<br>They were also crying. Their tears were not fake. They were deeply concerned for their father&rsquo;s suffering.<br>This was familial love. It was the sentiment brought forth by a bloodline connection.<br>&ldquo;Forget it. You all can leave,&rdquo; Chu Feng waved his hand.<br>He had decided to spare Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, thank you, thank you for not killing our father.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We brothers will forever remember your kindness.&rdquo;<br>Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo began to kowtow to Chu Feng to express their appreciation.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng waved his arm and brought the two of them back to their feet.<br>&ldquo;No matter what wrongs your father might&rsquo;ve committed, our relationship will remain unchanged.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Go ahead and leave,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>The Wuming Clan did not hesitate. They immediately took Wuming Doutian and left.<br>After the Wuming Clansmen left, the surroundings burst into loud cheers.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s name began to resonate throughout the region. The shouting of his name was even more resounding than thunder.<br>The people that had been showing disdain and contempt for Chu Feng earlier were all praising him at that moment.<br>They were praising him without holding anything back. They were admitting that Chu Feng was the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>However, facing their praises, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression remained cold. He did not respond to them at all. Instead, he walked towards the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Only after arriving beside the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did Chu Feng reveal a smile.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s aged face was covered in tears.<br>If the Wuming Clan was like a giant mountain crushing the Chu Heavenly Clan, then the person enduring the greatest burden, the great pressure, of that mountain would be him that old and magnanimous old man.<br>His own clan&rsquo;s geniuses were being suppressed, yet he was powerless to do anything. This sort of sensation was definitely very unpleasant.<br>Fortunately, it had all come to an end.<br>The grudges of three generations had finally been brought to and end by Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands.<br>On that day, the once discarded child had accomplished what no other clansman had been capable of.<br>All by himself, he had shattered the giant mountain that had been crushing down on the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>He had defeated the man deemed as the strongest individual in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Wuming Doutian.<br>Furthermore, his victory was very thorough.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, let&rsquo;s go home,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Yes, yes, let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief nodded repeatedly.<br>Then, before the numerous gazes of the crowd, the two of them walked back into the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&hellip;...<br>The Wuming Clan had left the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory.<br>However, they did not leave the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>After all, their Lord Realm Master was currently suffering from the forbidden medicines&rsquo; backlash, and was on the verge of dying.<br>Inside a giant palace-like war chariot was a grand formation.<br>Countless substances flickering with light hung in the vicinity of the grand formation.<br>They were all precious materials. Those precious materials were all gathered so they could be refined by the grand formation and converted into power.<br>The converted power was flowing quickly towards the center of the grand formation without stopping.<br>It was the formation core. A person was lying inside the formation core. It was Wuming Doutian.<br>He was no longer screaming. However, his health was much weaker than before.<br>He was completely emaciated. His appearance had long become unrecognizable. He looked like a dried up corpse.<br>As for his aura, it was extremely weak.<br>He was on the verge of death.<br>Regardless of how many precious materials they'd gathered, they were unable to save him.<br>&ldquo;Lord father!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Realm Master!&rdquo;<br>Weeping cries lingered in the palace hall.<br>No matter how wicked and heinous Wuming Doutian was in the eyes of the others, he was a good clan chief and father in the eyes of the Wuming clansmen.<br>None of them wished for him to die like that.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the tightly shut palace entrance shattered.<br>This scene greatly alarmed everyone present.<br>They thought that Chu Feng had regretted his decision to spare them and had chased after them.<br>However, upon turning towards the shattered entrance, they discovered that it was not Chu Feng.<br>It was a man wearing a blue gown. He also had a head of blue hair.<br>The man was a stranger.<br>&ldquo;Who are you?! You dare trespass upon this place?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Courting death!&rdquo;<br>As the Wuming Clansmen were already feeling stressed, this sudden intruder greatly enraged them.<br>Many experts all rushed towards him at the same time.<br>&ldquo;Scram.&rdquo;<br>That blue-gowned man waved his sleeve.<br>&ldquo;Crash~~~&rdquo;<br>The many experts that had rushed him were all instantly defeated.<br>They were all sent flying.<br>When they landed, they were all bleeding from their seven facial orifices and were unable to move in the slightest. They had all been seriously injured.<br>Seeing that, the Wuming Clansmen were all terrified.<br>The reason for that was because one of the experts that had rushed to attack the intruder was an Utmost Exalted-level expert!<br></p></div>
