        <div><span>: Sisters</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;Big sister, why did you tell Chu Feng your identity?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He helped me today; it&rsquo;s only right for me to return the favor. I&rsquo;d rather be honest with him than have him find out in the future,&rdquo; Li Wu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I recall you mentioning him before, but back then, you said that he was a small fry you encountered in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. I was surprised when you suddenly told me that he could help me overcome the formations,&rdquo; Feng Ling said.</span><br><span>While Feng Ling had first met Chu Feng inside the remnant, she had actually received a tip-off from Li Wu about him in advance. Li Wu had told her that there was something special about Chu Feng and that he might be able to help her in clearing the trials.</span><br><span>&ldquo;My curse happened to act up while he was around. While he had only alleviated the superficial symptoms, that still shows that he&rsquo;s not as simple as he looks. To be frank, I didn&rsquo;t bear high hopes either. I thought that we might as well give it a try since we&rsquo;re stuck anyway. Who could have thought that he would clear the trials in a single try when we have failed so many times before?&rdquo; Li Wu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I also didn&rsquo;t think that fellow would be that formidable. Furthermore, the trials we underwent were different from those before,&rdquo; Feng Ling said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Was he able to clear the trials because they became easier?&rdquo; Li Wu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What are you thinking? How could the trials become easier? They became much harder than before. While the remnant poses different trials to us each time we challenge it, we have always been able to safely escape whenever we got stuck. This time around, if Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t been around, I would have really died in there,&rdquo; Feng Ling said.</span><br><span>Li Wu was surprised to hear that.</span><br><span>&ldquo;His observation skills are above mine, but that&rsquo;s not all to it. I was nearly scared out of my wits for the third trial,&rdquo; Feng Ling said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What happened in the third trial?&rdquo; Li Wu&rsquo;s face turned grim.</span><br><span>She knew that something huge must have happened for Feng Ling to say such words.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big sister, what do you think about my talents?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is that a question at all? While you had to cultivate all over again as a junior, I doubt that there is anyone else in the current world of cultivation who can match you,&rdquo; Li Wu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought too. The third trial was a test where I gained additional strength depending on how great my talent is. I thought that I would be unrivaled there, but I couldn&rsquo;t deal with the monsters that appeared at all. They were that powerful. Yet, Chu Feng crushed those monsters with absolute ease. A single strike was all it took for him to destroy everything. The talent I have been so proud of was nothing before him,&rdquo; Feng Ling said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;His talent&hellip; is at that kind of level?&rdquo; Li Wu was astonished.</span><br><span>While she had known back then that Chu Feng was decently talented, she had thought that it was only relative to those in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. If not for this meeting, she would have never thought that Chu Feng could come this far from that shabby place.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big sister, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked. She noticed worry and hostility on Li Wu&rsquo;s face.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I have heard things about Chu Feng. He is a vicious man. It might still be possible for me to reconcile my difference with him, but you stole our lord&rsquo;s treasure from him. He might harbor a grudge against you for that,&rdquo; Li Wu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big sister, are you planning to kill him?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the safest way,&rdquo; Li Wu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big sister, there&rsquo;s no need for that. I don&rsquo;t think that he&rsquo;s an unreasonable person. It can&rsquo;t be helped if he harbors a grudge against me over this, but we can make it up to him in the future. Besides, he&rsquo;s on close terms with Bai Yunqing. What if Bai Yunqing learns about what we did and blames you for it?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked with a smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;So what if Bai Yunqing finds out? I&rsquo;ll just kill him too!&rdquo; Li Wu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh? If that&rsquo;s the case, you should just kill the two of them right away. Why are you only targeting Chu Feng?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you think I dare not do it?&rdquo; Li Wu frowned.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Fine, fine. There&rsquo;s nothing my big sister doesn&rsquo;t dare to do. I&rsquo;m just joking with you!&rdquo; Feng Ling grabbed Li Wu&rsquo;s arm and pacified her.</span><br><span>However, Li Wu shook her hand off and said, &ldquo;If Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent is that great, he&rsquo;ll mature faster than I have expected. I still think that we should kill him lest he go after you in the future, but I won&rsquo;t do it if you are reluctant.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s spare him. I&rsquo;m already feeling bad for stealing his possession,&rdquo; Feng Ling said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t regret it,&rdquo; Li Wu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I never regret my decisions,&rdquo; Feng Ling replied with a smile.</span><br><span>Wu!</span><br><span>Just then, Li Wu&rsquo;s face suddenly warped in pain as black feathers sprouted from her body.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big sister, your curse is acting up again!&rdquo; Feng Ling quickly grabbed Li Wu&rsquo;s arms to </span><span>support her.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. It&rsquo;ll subside soon enough.&rdquo; Li Wu waved her hand.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you think our lord&rsquo;s treasure can resolve the curse&rsquo;s backlash?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked as she took out the black crystal.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What in the world is this?&rdquo; Li Wu found herself helplessly drawn to the black crystal as well, so much so that she momentarily forgot about the excruciating pain she was under.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big sister, you don&rsquo;t recognize this item too?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t fully recovered my memories yet, just like you,&rdquo; Li Wu replied.</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>The black crystal suddenly released a powerful suction force that dragged Li Wu and Feng Ling into it, but moments later, the two of them were expelled. Their faces had turned pale, and cold sweat drenched their bodies. They looked terribly weakened.</span><br><span>It was a struggle for them to even stay on their feet.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you still want to give it a try?&rdquo; a feminine voice echoed from the black crystal.</span><br><span>It was the voice of the remnant&rsquo;s master!</span><br><span>&ldquo;Paying respects to milord!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Feng Ling and Li Wu jolted in fright as they hurriedly bowed to the black crystal.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, we didn&rsquo;t mean to covet your treasure. We were worried that your treasure would fall into others&rsquo; hands. Milord, we sisters are willing to pledge our lives to you once more. Please tell us where you are, and we&rsquo;ll head there right away!&rdquo; Li Wu said.</span><br><span>On the other hand, Feng Ling lowered her head in fright, not daring to say anything at all.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t my subordinates anymore. Go and live your lives,&rdquo; the feminine voice echoed from the black crystal.</span><br><span>After those words were spoken, the black crystal suddenly darted toward Chu Feng in a streak of light.</span><br></p></div>
