        <div>: Good Things Come In Threes<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Milord, w-what&rsquo;s wrong? What happened?&rdquo;<br>Sensing that something was going awry, the Godwish Grandmother quickly rushed in front of the Netherworld Envoy. It looked like she was asking a question, but she was actually holding back the Netherworld Envoy.<br>She could tell that the Netherworld Envoy was going to do something detrimental to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This item is the Divine Vat of our Netherworld Sect. Usually, the decision of whether to plant a Netherworld Embryo into a talented child is based on the Netherworld Envoys&rsquo; judgment, so there are times when there are lapses in our judgment, such that the children are unable to withstand the Netherworld Embryo.<br>&ldquo;However, a child who has received the guidance of the Divine Vat would surely be able to withstand the Netherworld Embryo. Not only so, but his body will also be able to fuse impeccably with it too.<br>&ldquo;During the experiment back then, there were only three children who survived having two Netherworld Embryos implanted into them. Of them, two suffered tremendous pain, but there was one who overcame it with ease. He&rsquo;s the one whom we have found through the guidance of the Divine Vat.<br>&ldquo;However, the guidance usually occurs only to children of ten years of age or younger, so it&rsquo;s completely unheard of that a junior of your age would actually be able to trigger it. Your body must be very compatible with our Netherworld Embryo. Godwish Grandmother, I&rsquo;ll really have to thank you for bringing such a talented individual to me,&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy spoke with greed gleaming in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Milord, didn&rsquo;t you say that children of ten years of age and above would find it hard to withstand the Netherworld Embryo? Even though Chu Feng is a junior, he has already exceeded ten years of age,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother said.<br>&ldquo;Godwish Grandmother, I don&rsquo;t see you as an outsider so I&rsquo;ll be direct with you. It&rsquo;s typically true that any of ten years of age and above who takes in the Netherworld Embryo will end up either dead or crippled, but it&rsquo;s different for him. He&rsquo;s someone who has received the guidance of the Divine Vat. I believe that the Divine Vat wouldn&rsquo;t make a mistake. He&rsquo;ll surely be able to withstand the power of the Netherworld Embryo,&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy said.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, what are you standing there for? Hurry up and run!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng.<br>However, the Godwish Grandmother and<br>Lady of Dao Sea didn&rsquo;t bother sending a message at all. They knew that it was impossible to escape from the Netherworld Envoy.<br>Putong!<br>The Godwish Grandmother kneeled to the ground and pleaded, &ldquo;Milord, he&rsquo;s my junior. I was the one who insisted on bringing him with me. Please, let him off!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What are you doing, Godwish Grandmother?&rdquo; He received the guidance of our Netherworld Sect. That&rsquo;s a good thing!&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy said.<br>With a single step, he walked up to Chu Feng.<br>Shengguang Baimei immediately released his martial power, hoping to stop the Netherworld Envoy from laying his hands on Chu Feng. However, before he could make a move, he found himself freezing in place. The same applied to Chu Feng too.<br>Everyone except for the Netherworld Envoy had lost their ability to move. A power that surpassed that of Martial Exalted level had fallen upon the vicinity, rendering even the Godwish Grandmother utterly helpless.<br>That was the power of a Half-God level cultivator!<br>&ldquo;Child, just bear with it. It&rsquo;ll be beneficial for you if you can pull through.&rdquo;<br>The Netherworld Envoy took out the same dagger he used on Song Yun earlier.<br>Awoo!<br>It was then that a piercing sound echoed behind Chu Feng. The crowd immediately turned their gazes over, only to see a black gush of gaseous flames rushing toward the Netherworld Envoy.<br>The black gaseous flames harnessed incredible might, such that it actually knocked the Netherworld Envoy back. Yet, Chu Feng surprisingly remained unharmed even though the black gaseous flames had barely brushed him by.<br>Furthermore, the black gaseous flames even stopped right beside Chu Feng. It wrapped itself around him before gradually converging to form a silhouette.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you?&rdquo; Chu Feng exclaimed in astonishment.<br>The Godwish Grandmother,<br>Lady of Dao Sea, Daoist Niantian, and the others were shocked too. The black gaseous flames had morphed into the form of a little girl that looked to be around twelve. Despite her young appearance, she looked incredibly beautiful.<br>Her skin was fair and delicate, to the point where one would hesitate to touch her out of fear of injuring her. Her facial features were also exquisite, especially her eyes. She had a clean and innocent gaze, unmarred by the darkness of the world.<br>Yet, no one dared to look down on her due to the black gaseous flames she was wrapped in. It emanated a terrifying aura as if it had originated from the depths of hell, inducing goosebumps.<br>Chu Feng had met this little girl before in the Great Chilicosm Upper Realm.<br>Back then, the Chu Heavenly Clan was pursuing a demon that was killing many innocent lives in the Great Chilicosm Upper Realm. Chu Feng had investigated the gaze, and it led him to this little girl. It was just that the little girl was too powerful, such that the Chu Heavenly Clan was no match for it.<br>The entire group from the Chu Heavenly Clan should have died in the encounter, including Chu Feng. Yet, a miracle happened.<br>When Chu Feng came close to the little girl, she suddenly seemed to be awakened to her conscience. Instead of hurting Chu Feng, she simply turned around and left.<br>The little girl disappeared from the Great Chilicosm Upper Realm afterward, and Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t seen her ever since.<br>Who could have thought that they would meet each other here?<br>&ldquo;Could it be that&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng suddenly thought about something. He sensed that someone had been observing him from the shadows ever since they arrived in this Ordinary Realm. He thought that it was the Netherworld Envoy, but from the looks of it now, it was probably this little girl.<br>On top of that, the Netherworld Envoy had constructed a formation to seal off the entire realm in order to capture something. That &lsquo;something&rsquo; could very well be this little girl<br>&ldquo;Is this really happening? Hahahahaha! To think that even you would appear as well! My gosh, lady luck is really gracing me today! It seems like good things don&rsquo;t come in pairs but threes!&rdquo;<br>The Netherworld Envoy burst into frenzied laughter.<br>That verified Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess&mdash;the Netherworld Envoy was indeed trying to capture the little girl.<br>But soon, the Netherworld Envoy directed a questioning gaze toward the little girl.<br>&ldquo;That's weird. Why would you appear now when you have already hidden for so long? It can&rsquo;t be that&hellip; the two of you are acquainted?&rdquo;<br>The Netherworld Envoy turned his gaze toward Chu Feng.<br>The little girl didn&rsquo;t answer that question, but her pure eyes started to be tainted by darkness.<br>Whoosh!<br>A burst of black gaseous flame poured out from her body.<br>Boom! Boom!<br>A series of explosions ensued.<br>By the time Chu Feng snapped out of his daze, the little girl and the Netherworld Envoy were no longer in his line of sight. However, tremendous martial power and a flood of black gaseous flames could be seen in the distant sky.<br>That little girl had made a move against the Netherworld Envoy!<br></p></div>
