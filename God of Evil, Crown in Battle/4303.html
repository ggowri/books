        <h1>Chapter 4302</h1>
        <div> - Bloodline Going Berserk<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Tsk, tsk, tsk&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a burst of laughter sounded.<br>Then, the red-haired leader and the three hundred plus experts of the Demon Morph Clan appeared from nearby.<br>Turned out, they did not really leave. Instead, they were hidden nearby and secretly observing everything.<br>As matters stood, Xianhai Shaoyu realized that all of this was a scheme from the very start.<br>Their internal strife from earlier was merely a show the Demon Morph Clan deliberately performed for him. Their purpose was all so that he would relax his guard.<br>Even Xianhai Renhu&rsquo;s decision to inform him of the Demon Morph Clan&rsquo;s purpose in coming to the Holy Light Galaxy was a plot to gain his confidence.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not my fourth uncle?!&rdquo; Xianhai Shaoyu asked with a stern voice. Anger filled his voice.<br>&ldquo;Shaoyu, you shouldn&rsquo;t be this foolish, no? How could you fail to ascertain if I&rsquo;m your fourth uncle?&rdquo; Xianhai Renhu&rsquo;s smile grew even more mocking.<br>Seeing that reaction from Xianhai Renhu, Xianhai Shaoyu was certain that this man before him was indeed his fourth uncle.<br>But, the more certain that it was indeed his fourth uncle, the more furious he became.<br>He was unable to accept being betrayed by his close relative.<br>&ldquo;Why are you doing this?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Shaoyu while gnashing his teeth,<br>&ldquo;After the Immortal Sea Fish Clan fell in the control of your father, I&rsquo;ve completely lost hope in it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ever since leaving the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, everyone in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan has become my enemy. Of course&hellip; that also included you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is no rumor that I&rsquo;ve betrayed the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. Instead, that is the truth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Shaoyu oh Shaoyu, you are gifted with intelligence and exceptional talent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, in the end, you are too overly protected by the Immortal Sea Fish Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand that, at times, the warm and affectionate memories of one&rsquo;s past are things that cannot be trusted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why I did not directly attack you earlier was all because I knew you possessed that protective formation on you. Because of that, we cannot meet force with force.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But now, you no longer possess that protective formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With your cultivation, you are nothing more than a fish on the chopping block.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Xianhai Renhu extended his hand and made a grabbing motion. With that, Xianhai Shaoyu was grabbed up into the air by him.<br>Then, the light within Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s body began to squirm violently.<br>Boundless suction was released from Xianhai Renhu&rsquo;s hand. It was that strange suction that caused the change to the light within Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s body.<br>Xianhai Renhu was trying to forcibly remove the power that could strengthen Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s bloodline from his body while it has yet to fuse completely with Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>At the same time, the red-haired leader arrived before Chu Feng.<br>Unlike Xianhai Renhu, he did not raise Chu Feng from the ground.<br>Instead, he took out a black bottle gourd.<br>It was a completely black bottle gourd engraved with unusual symbols and runes.<br>After taking out that bottle gourd, the red-haired leader held it in his left hand and began to form hand seals with his right hand.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>The runes and symbols of the bottle gourd began to flicker with a purple light.<br>At the same time, strange purple gaseous flames were released from the bottle gourd. The gaseous flames completely engulfed Chu Feng.<br>Like the devil&rsquo;s talon, the purple gaseous flames began to viciously bore their way into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. In the process, they left Chu Feng completely mutilated.<br>But, the purpose of the purple gaseous flames was not to kill Chu Feng. Instead, like what Xianhai Renhu was doing to Xianhai Shaoyu, the purple gaseous flames were intending to stip Chu Feng of the power that was assimilating with him.<br>In comparison, the method that Xianhai Renhu was using on Xianhai Shaoyu was much more humane.<br>But, even though Xianhai Renhu&rsquo;s method was not as vicious as that of the red-haired leader, Xianhai Shaoyu was still screaming miserably in pain.<br>From that, one could imagine how much suffering Chu Feng who was being attacked by the even more vicious method would be under.<br>The people from the Demon Morph Clan that were standing in the distance were showing absolutely no sympathy at this sight. Instead, they became very excited and were laughing and sneering repeatedly.<br>Like the name of their clan, the Demon Morph Clansmen were no different from demons.<br>They were a truly evil power.<br>For the sake of greater power, they were willing to act by fair means of foul. They&rsquo;ve simply witnessed spectacles like the one before them too many times already.<br>As for their excitement, it was because they&rsquo;ve inadvertently discovered the change occurring in the starry sky and received this opportunity.<br>Should they be able to smoothly obtain the power within Chu Feng and Xianhai Shaoyu, they would&rsquo;ve made a massive contribution.<br>All of them would be rewarded by their Demon Morph Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Zzzz---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, lightnings spilled out from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>The lightnings shot straight toward the red-haired leader. Caught by surprise, the red-haired leader was unable to react in time. The lightnings managed to stick his palm that was holding onto the bottle gourd.<br>&ldquo;Ahhh---&rdquo;<br>Stuck by the lightnings, the red-haired leader&rsquo;s hand was completely charred.<br>In great pain, he ended up letting go of the bottle gourd in his hand.<br>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;<br>But, before the red-haired leader could think much, he turned his gaze to Chu Feng and discovered that more and more lightnings were emerging from his body.<br>The lightnings actually forced back the purple gaseous flames unleashed from the bottle gourd.<br>Furthermore, they were currently crushing the purple gaseous flames.<br>In merely a blink of an eye, the purple gaseous flames that were devastating Chu Feng&rsquo;s body earlier were completely destroyed by the lightnings unleashed from his body.<br>&ldquo;Clamor---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a gaseous flame surged out from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>Then, boundless lightnings emerged above Chu Feng.<br>Once the lightnings appeared, they rapidly expanded. In a blink of an eye, they covered the region above all the people present.<br>The nine-colored lightnings were extremely berserk as they covered this region.<br>Their might was not at all inferior to the power unleashed from the black case earlier.<br>In fact, in terms of imposingness, the nine-colored lightnings were even more terrifying than the power of the black case.<br>At the same time, Chu Feng who was lying on the ground suddenly started floating. He stood up.<br>Chu Feng was still unconscious. But, his body was being enveloped by the lightnings.<br>His hair fluttered about from the lightnings enveloping him. His body that was mutilated by the purple gaseous flames was completely healed. Not only that, he appeared very imposing and terrifying.<br>Sensing the aura unleashed from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, the people from the Demon Morph Clan, including even the red-haired leader, started frowning. Subconsciously, they all stepped back.<br>Without a doubt, the power that was being unleashed from within Chu Feng was a power that far surpassed his own.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; this is impossible.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is impossible. How could such a thing occur in such a desolate place?&rdquo;<br>A look of disbelief filled the red-haired leader&rsquo;s eyes.<br>It seemed like he had received a terrifying shock.<br>&ldquo;What is going on?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is it a protective formation?&rdquo;<br>Seeing his reaction, Xianhai Renhu asked with a stern voice.<br>Even he had never witnessed such a terrifying disposition of forces.<br>Both the lightnings that filled the starry sky and Chu Feng who was floating in midair brought upon him a sense of extreme unease and fear that originated from within his soul.<br>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not a protective formation,&rdquo; said the red-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;What is it then?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Renhu.<br>&ldquo;One&rsquo;s bloodline going berserk,&rdquo; said the red-haired leader.<br></p></div>
