        <div>: Can Only Be Mine<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;One more thing, Chu Feng. Take this with you.&rdquo;<br>The chief elder passed a jade bottle over to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chief elder, this is&hellip;?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng took the jade bottle and pried it open, only to see that it was filled with black liquid. It had a viscous texture and smelled a little pungent. It looked like poison at first glance.<br>Nevertheless, Chu Feng was still able to tell that this was an item for tempering one&rsquo;s body, just that he wasn&rsquo;t certain what kind of effects it would bring about.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a newcomer cleansing three days later. It&rsquo;ll do you much good if you temper your body with this first before undergoing the cleansing,&rdquo; the chief elder said.<br>&ldquo;Newcomer cleansing? What kind of cleansing is it?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had joined the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect for some time now, so he had some understanding of the practices here. He would usually be informed of most upcoming events, but he never heard about this &lsquo;newcomer cleansing&rsquo; before, which was why he was curious about it.<br>&ldquo;The location of the cleansing is a place named &lsquo;Blackwater Sixfinger Lake&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a cultivation formation personally set up by our sect founder. In truth, the natural energies in our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect far surpass the outside world, and it&rsquo;s much easier to assimilate too. However, the reason why you can&rsquo;t sense them is because you haven&rsquo;t undergone the cleansing yet.<br>&ldquo;Usually, the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake only opens once every five years, and it has only been four years since its last opening. However, I just received word that the lake has already opened, and three days from now, all disciples who have joined the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect over the last four years will be entering it to undergo the cleansing.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be announcing this matter tomorrow, and I believe that the other three halls will be doing the same too. This bottle I gave you is actually the Blackwater Essence from the lake. Fill up a tub with water, add in a suitable amount of Blackwater Essence, and soak yourself in it. Repeat this thrice a day over the next three days.<br>&ldquo;When you finally enter the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake three days later, your body will be in a much more optimal condition to benefit from the effects of the lake.<br>&ldquo;Ah, I should also tell you that the Blackwater Essence is an incredibly valuable resource. I can&rsquo;t afford to spare a set for all of the newcomers in our Black Tortoise Hall, so I hope that you won&rsquo;t tell anyone about this,&rdquo; the chief elder said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, chief elder,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>He knew that the chief elder was according to him special privilege here.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to thank me. You&rsquo;re the most outstanding disciple in our North Tortoise Hall, and I&rsquo;m counting on you to bring honor to us. There are also some records in the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake, and they are held by Lord Dugu Lingtina at the moment. If possible, I hope that you can put those records under your name instead.&rdquo;<br>The chief elder looked at Chu Feng with eyes filled with anticipation.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best not to disappoint you,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>To be honest, he wasn&rsquo;t too interested in the cleansing, but he looked forward to clearing the records.<br>He continued chatting with the chief elder for a little longer before finally returning to his residence. As the chief elder instructed, he tempered his body with the Blackwater Essence. It did bring about some special effects to his body, though it was a relief to him that it didn&rsquo;t bring about any harmful side effects.<br>The following day, the news about the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake&rsquo;s imminent opening in two days&rsquo; time started spreading throughout the sect, and the newcomers learned that they had to undergo cleansing there.<br>Early in the morning, Chu Feng prepared a tub of water, poured the Blackwater Essence in, and tempered his body. After he was done, he walked out of his residence and tried perceiving his surroundings. To his surprise, he could feel the natural energies around him growing a bit more concentrated.<br>This showed that the chief elder was indeed speaking the truth. Only those who had undergone the cleansing would be able to sense the natural energies in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>&ldquo;Chief elder?&rdquo;<br>Just as Chu Feng was returning back to his residence, a person suddenly appeared in front of him. It was the chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s talk inside.&rdquo;<br>The chief elder walked into the residence, and Chu Feng quickly followed behind him.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, chief elder?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng noticed that there was a grave look on the chief elder&rsquo;s face, hinting that something huge had just happened.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether this is a good thing for you or not, but you need to be mentally prepared. Some things simply aren&rsquo;t meant to be in life, and there&rsquo;s no need to force it,&rdquo; the chief elder said.<br>&ldquo;Does it have something to do with Zi Ling?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could guess from the chief elder&rsquo;s words that something must have happened to Zi Ling.<br>&ldquo;Just last night, the sectmaster came out of his closed-door training, and she made an announcement. She&rsquo;s going to find a husband for Zi Ling through a selection,&rdquo; the chief elder said.<br>&ldquo;Find a husband for Zi Ling through a selection? How so?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a frown.<br>&ldquo;All disciples of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect are eligible, but based on what I&rsquo;ve heard, there are four conditions. First, one must be a junior. Second, it must be within a month,&rdquo; the chief elder said.<br>&ldquo;Junior and within a month? Does that mean that only juniors are eligible, and she&rsquo;ll select a husband for Zi Ling within a month&rsquo;s time?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not too sure either, but that&rsquo;s likely to be the case. The other two conditions haven&rsquo;t been announced yet, so I think the sectmaster will explain the meaning behind those words afterward. This news will start spreading very soon, and I&rsquo;m certain that the Hidden Dragon Disciples will give it a try. Chu Feng, while you&rsquo;re eligible to join the selection as well, I advise you not to go,&rdquo; the chief elder said.<br>&ldquo;Chief elder, I&rsquo;m willing to listen to you on other matters, but for this, I have no choice but to go. Zi Ling can only be mine,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br></p></div>
