        <h1>Chapter 3322</h1>
        <div> - Bullying Excessively<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, those grand characters had completely revealed their anger. The gazes with which they looked to Chu Feng were even more frightening than those of ferocious beasts. They seemed to want to eat Chu Feng alive.<br>The more they stared at Chu Feng with malicious intent in their hearts, the more furious they felt.<br>After all, not to mention a person of the younger generation, even if it was a person of the older generation, they would already be shivering in fear upon being faced with their overflowing anger.<br>However, Chu Feng was different. He was simply a freak.<br>Even though he was faced with their furious gazes and displeased looks, that freak reacted as if he did not see them at all. There was no trace of panic on his face at all.<br>He simply did not put them in his eyes at all.<br>&ldquo;Lord Liangqiu Chengfeng, is the treasure within that spirit formation capable of being divided?&rdquo; Suddenly, someone asked Liangqiu Chengfeng that question.<br>He asked that question with the intention of verifying one thing. He wanted to know if it was worth it to exchange their cultivation resources for the treasure within the spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;The way this old man sees it, that treasure is a miraculous cultivation resource that is very difficult to come by, and is capable of providing enormous assistance to our martial cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although that treasure cannot be divided, the people present are capable of enjoying it at the same time,&rdquo; Liangqiu Chengfeng said.<br>Hearing what Liangqiu Chengfeng said, the expressions of the grand characters present all changed. Even Song Boqiu&rsquo;s gaze turned complicated.<br>Evidently, Liangqiu Chengfeng&rsquo;s words had stirred them up.<br>Suddenly, a person of the older generation took out the bodies of light that he had captured and walked toward Chu Feng. &ldquo;Everyone, although young friend Chu Feng is very young, what he has said is not false. For us to be able to reach this place, whilst Lord Liangqiu Chengfeng&rsquo;s contribution cannot go unnoticed, young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s contributions also cannot go unnoticed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let us consider this a reward for his contributions.&rdquo;<br>He&hellip; had come to terms with Chu Feng&rsquo;s demand.<br>Faced with that unknown treasure, faced with that rare cultivation resource, he had reached terms.<br>&ldquo;Forget about it, forget about it.&rdquo;<br>Soon after that, the others present also began to take out the bodies of light that they&rsquo;d captured.<br>Even Song Boqiu came to terms.<br>Seeing the bodies of light that were handed over to him, Chu Feng revealed a mocking smile. He said, &ldquo;Seniors, one must be honest and sincere. I demanded all of them; why are you all hiding some?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing those words, the older generation&rsquo;s expressions turned ugly again.<br>Never did they expect for Chu Feng to know even the amount of bodies of light contained in that place. Never did they expect that he would know that they were hiding some.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, aren&rsquo;t you being too excessive?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We are already being extremely benevolent to hand over a portion of them to you. Yet, you actually want all of them?&rdquo;<br>Those people of the older generation were all people with power and status. They would naturally not admit to the fact that they were deliberately hiding cultivation resources from Chu Feng. Instead, they shifted the topic, and blamed Chu Feng for being greedy.<br>Faced with their reprimands, Chu Feng reacted in an extremely calm manner. In a disapproving tone he said, &ldquo;My demand was for all of the cultivation resources. If you all are unwilling to hand over all of them, you can take these back.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You brat!!!&rdquo;<br>These grand individuals were all gnashing their teeth furiously because of Chu Feng.<br>However, they were helpless before him. In the end, they all took out the cultivation resources that they&rsquo;d hidden and handed them to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This should be fine now, no?&rdquo; Someone spoke in a very displeased manner.<br>After retrieving all of those cultivation resources, Chu Feng still shook his head. He said, &ldquo;This is still not everything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What? That&rsquo;s not everything? We have clearly given you all that we have.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are truly being too excessive here!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what you are doing right now is deliberately creating trouble!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the people of the older generation were all snarling angrily. They were truly at the end of their patience.<br>The reason for that was because they had indeed handed all of their cultivation resources to Chu Feng.<br>Faced with the angry rebukes from the older generation, Chu Feng remained calm and disapproving. Then, he turned his gaze toward Li Taiyi, who was lying in a corner and treating his injury.<br>At that moment, the crowd came to a sudden realization. Chu Feng was not deliberately causing trouble. Instead, he wanted Li Taiyi&rsquo;s portion of cultivation resources as well.<br>However, Li Taiyi would definitely not be willing to hand over his cultivation resources. Furthermore, no one present was willing to make an enemy of him.<br>Chu Feng had presented them with a very difficult problem.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a figure arrived before Li Taiyi.<br>Seeing that person, the crowd revealed joyous expressions. They had nearly forgotten about him.<br>Although they did not dare to make an enemy out of Li Taiyi, that person dared. After all, that person was the person who had seriously injured Li Taiyi. He was Song Boqiu.<br>&ldquo;Li Taiyi, are you going to take them out yourself, or must I do it for you?&rdquo; Song Boqiu asked Li Taiyi.<br>However, before Li Taiyi could respond, Song Boqiu directly snatched away Li Taiyi&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack that was hanging on his waist.<br>That said, Song Boqiu did not seize any of Li Taiyi&rsquo;s other possessions. He merely took out the cultivation resources that Li Taiyi had retrieved earlier, and then tossed back his Cosmos Sack to him.<br>&ldquo;Song Boqiu, Chu Feng, this old man will settle this debt with the two of you!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Li Taiyi&rsquo;s entire body was shivering. He was truly furious.<br>As a Supreme Elder of the Li Heavenly Clan, it had only been him making things difficult for others. Never had he experienced such humiliation like he did at that moment.<br>Although what had happened to him today was caused by Song Boqiu, he knew very well that Chu Feng was the main culprit behind it all.<br>Thus, he was not joking around with those words. He was truly planning to take revenge on the two of them.<br>However, to his great fury, both Song Boqiu and Chu Feng ignored his threat.<br>The two of them did not put him in their eyes at all.<br>At that moment, Song Boqiu arrived before Chu Feng and handed Li Taiyi&rsquo;s cultivation resources to him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I will be frank. If you are unable to breach that formation, you will have to return those to us without any exception,&rdquo; Song Boqiu threatened Chu Feng.<br>Faced with Song Boqiu&rsquo;s threat, Chu Feng revealed a faint smile. He said, &ldquo;Senior, I will also be frank. I will do my best to breach that spirit formation. However, I cannot guarantee success.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can either have me try.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Or&hellip; you can take those things back right now.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he took out all of the cultivation resources and handed them to Song Boqiu.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>Faced with such a Chu Feng, those grand characters became so furious that they that felt their hearts, liver, spleen and lungs were on the verge of exploding.<br>Chu Feng had demanded that they hand over all of their cultivation resources in exchange for his help in breaching that spirit formation.<br>However, Chu Feng was actually unwilling to guarantee success even after they handed all their cultivation resources to him.<br>That was simply&hellip; excessive bullying!!!<br></p></div>
