        <div> - Being Struck<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Apart from this, there&rsquo;s another possibility. That would be Chu Feng,&rdquo; Xue Ji said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng!!!&rdquo; Hearing those words, surprised expressions flashed through the eyes of the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal. However, soon, their surprise disappeared.<br>Not only that, the Immeasurable Immortal even said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible, it&rsquo;s extremely possible.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng was capable of setting up a formation that could withstand attacks from peak Martial Emperors. It is true, his world spirit techniques cannot be looked down upon.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, that Chu Feng absolutely cannot be left alive,&rdquo; The World Devastator Immortal added.<br>Hearing those words, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s gaze changed slightly.<br>After a short while, he said, &ldquo;I have toyed enough with that plaything Chu Feng. It&rsquo;s time to destroy him.&rdquo;<br>Deep confidence filled the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s eyes when he said those words. Plaything; to him, Chu Feng was nothing more than a plaything, something that he could toy with as he wished. When he was done toying with Chu Feng, he could kill Chu Feng anytime he wished.<br>However, afterward, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master turned his ruthless gaze toward the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal. &ldquo;No matter how hard dealing with Chu Feng might be, it remains that he&rsquo;s a brat. The two of you have lived for thousands of years. Yet, you were toyed with by him. No matter what, you two must be punished.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal started to shiver. Immediately, the World Devastator Immortal said, &ldquo;Lord Hall Master, we have not returned empty handed from the Wonderstone Dao Ground. We managed to obtain the true treasure to the Five Elements Secret Skills.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What a joke! That stone army is under Chu Feng&rsquo;s control. Are you implying that you two can seize control of the stone army from Chu Feng?&rdquo; At that moment, Xue Ji, who had been silent for some time, spoke mockingly.<br>&ldquo;No, those stones from the Wonderstone Dao Ground are only a portion of the treasures. The actual treasure is with us.&rdquo; The World Devastator took out a scroll as he spoke and handed it to the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>At that moment, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s eyes shone. After receiving the scroll, he did not open it immediately. Instead, he began to inspect it carefully. Then, a light smile emerged on his face. He said, &ldquo;If the scroll truly contains treasures, I will not punish the two of you, and will instead reward you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Hall Master,&rdquo; Hearing those words, both the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal were overjoyed.<br>The World Devastator Immortal even began to ingratiate himself. With a beaming smile, he said, &ldquo;Lord Hall Master, that scroll is sealed. You will have to undo the seal in order to see the contents.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I did not dare to unseal it myself. This subordinate felt that only Lord Hall Master was qualified to see the contents of the scroll. Thus, Lord Hall Master, please unseal it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite sensible,&rdquo; Hearing those words, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s laughter was heard from underneath his mask. Then, he extended his hand and began to form a spirit formation. He stroked his hand across the scroll and dispelled the power lingering around it. Then, he opened the scroll.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after the scroll was opened, a liquid suddenly sprayed out from the scroll. Everything happened too quickly. Even though the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master dodged it immediately, he was still hit by a portion of the liquid.<br>Not only did the liquid spray onto his body, it also sprayed onto his face.<br>&ldquo;This!!!&rdquo;<br>Both the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal were greatly alarmed upon seeing this scene. Even Xue Ji, who was always calm and collected, was slightly surprised.<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, are you alright? We truly did not know that there was a mechanism to that scroll,&rdquo; After the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal managed to react to what had just happened, they hurriedly rushed forward to set up spirit formations to clean up the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Scram!&rdquo; However, before they could even approach him, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master shouted at them angrily. With a wave of his sleeve, the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal were sent flying once more. When they fell to the ground, they were bleeding from their seven apertures. Not to mention their meridians and veins, even their skulls were completely shattered.<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, we did not mean any disrespect, we merely wanted to help&hellip;&rdquo; The Immeasurable Immortal tried to explain in a weak voice.<br>&ldquo;Help my ass! This is fucking piss here!&rdquo; The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master shouted furiously. As his voice sounded, the entire region that they were in started to tremble. It could be seen that he was truly enraged.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The very next moment, the scroll began to flicker with radiance, and writing began to emerge from the scroll.<br>Although the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had suffered from the scroll, he was still unable to help himself from turning his gaze toward the scroll. However, right after looking at it, he became even more furious.<br>&ldquo;Is this the treasure that you two spoke of?!&rdquo;<br>In a furious rage, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master threw the scroll toward the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal.<br>The scroll was thrown with the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s martial power. After it reached the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal, that martial power exploded, destroying half of their physical bodies.<br>However, even with this being the case, the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal did not dare to heal their injuries. Enduring the pain, they opened the scroll.<br>Upon looking at the scroll, the two men&rsquo;s expressions changed enormously.<br>There was a single sentence written on the scroll.<br>&lsquo;Did you enjoy your granddaddy Chu Feng&rsquo;s piss?&rsquo;<br>Piss. It was indeed piss.<br>Not only was it piss, it was Chu Feng&rsquo;s piss on top of that. Furthermore, that piss had landed on the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s body and face.<br>What sort of existence was the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master? He was a genius blessed by the heavens from the Outer World. Even though Chu Feng was also from the Outer World, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had never placed Chu Feng in his eyes. He had felt Chu Feng to be a plaything that he could destroy at any time.<br>Yet now, Chu Feng had actually sprayed his piss all over the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>As such, how could the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master tolerate that? How could he not be angry?<br>Most importantly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s piss was supposed to spray on them.<br>It was they who had thought themselves to be clever, thus they had not dared to unseal the scroll and open it. Therefore, this disaster was all caused because of them. It was no surprise that at that moment, they were extremely afraid.<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, we were wrong, we were wrong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Please forgive us, please give us another chance.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal disregarded the pain that they felt and hurriedly kneeled on the ground to kowtow and beg for forgiveness.<br>The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s methods were something that the two of them knew very well. The reason why they had submitted to the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was because he was so extremely ruthless that they did not dare to disobey him.<br>&ldquo;You useless trash actually still dare to beg for forgiveness?&rdquo; The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master extended his hand and made a grabbing motion. The World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal were lifted into the air. Then, he threw them to Xue Ji&rsquo;s feet and said, &ldquo;Xue Ji, they are yours to handle. Make sure to punish them properly so that they remember this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; Xue Ji turned around and left as she spoke. Strangely, the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal&rsquo;s bodies began to float, following after Xue Ji.<br>After hearing from the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master that they would be given to Xue Ji to be punished, the two men&rsquo;s expression turned extremely ugly. It was as if they were experiencing an enormous terror. They began to beg the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master for forgiveness nonstop. However, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master did not even bother to take another glance at them.<br>Not long afterward, Xue Ji returned. The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had yet to wipe away the piss on his body. Instead, he grabbed his clothes and was smelling it.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have thought that Lord Hall Master would have such an indulgence,&rdquo; Seeing this scene, Xue Ji was unable to contain herself from laughing lightly.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not an indulgence. Merely, I wished to remember this smell,&rdquo; The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said.<br>&ldquo;Remember the smell?&rdquo; Xue Ji asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;The smell of humiliation. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, this is an enormous humiliation. This smell will remind me to make sure that I make Chu Feng wish that he was dead,&rdquo; The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said those words one word at a time. Overflowing hatred filled his words.<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, do not worry. As long as you wish for it, not to mention Chu Feng, we would be able to eliminate even the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves,&rdquo; Xue Ji said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Xue Ji, could it be that you&rsquo;ve succeeded?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was overjoyed. He forgot the displeasure he had been feeling earlier, and instead revealed great excitement.<br>Evidently, something major had succeeded.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve succeeded,&rdquo; Xue Ji nodded.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha, great,&rdquo; After it was confirmed, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master laughed heartily. After laughing, he walked over to Xue Ji&rsquo;s side. With a rare gentle tone, he said, &ldquo;Xue Ji, you are the only person who is actually capable of sharing this Hall Master&rsquo;s worries.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master extended his arms. He wanted to embrace Xue Ji.<br>However, Xue Ji only smiled charmingly at the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s incoming embrace. Her body floated into the sky and dodged the embrace. With a smile on her face, she said, &ldquo;Lord Hall Master, that is piss and not wine. There&rsquo;s no reason for you to get drunk over it.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, seemingly somewhat displeased. However, the displeasure soon disappeared, and he suddenly laughed, &ldquo;Hahaha, I was silly.&rdquo;<br>As for Xue Ji, she also laughed lightly. Then, her body floated into the air again and she disappeared.<br>Now only the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master remained in that place. He closed his eyes and sucked in a long breath. It was as if he was smelling Xue Ji&rsquo;s aroma.<br>When he opened his eyes again, he said, &ldquo;There are no women that can escape me. That is already the case in the Outer World. As such, you will be no exception.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;One day, I will make you serve me in delight.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, his eyes shone.<br>It was the light of confidence.<br><br></p></div>
