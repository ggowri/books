        <h1>Chapter 4818</h1>
        <div>: A Chance<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That person was no other than the sectmaster of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>Chu Feng was aware that the sectmaster wasn&rsquo;t fond of him, but the latter was the ruler within this sect, wielding great power and influence in her hands. More importantly, she was Zi Ling&rsquo;s master.<br>Even Chu Feng, who rarely panicked in the face of danger, couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a little worried about facing the sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, are you fine?&rdquo;<br>A warm body suddenly flew right into Chu Feng&rsquo;s arms and hugged him tightly. It was Zi Ling.<br>Even though they had already reunited with one another, her yearning for him was still as strong as ever.<br>Even without saying a word, Chu Feng could feel the intensity of her sentiments.<br>&ldquo;Zi Ling, where has your modesty as a woman gone to?&rdquo; the sectmaster berated her.<br>Zi Ling realized that she had acted out of place and quickly stepped away from Chu Feng&rsquo;s embrace. Nevertheless, her eyes were still focused on him, refusing to look away. She was worried that Chu Feng had gotten injured during the challenge.<br>&ldquo;Congratulations, Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>An unexpected sight occurred. The sectmaster actually started congratulating Chu Feng.<br>Despite her impassive expression, she was indeed relaying her blessings toward him.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all thanks to the sectmaster&rsquo;s blessing,&rdquo; Chu Feng bowed to the sectmaster in response.<br>He was in a good mood.<br>Despite it being nothing more than an ordinary congratulation, he was still glad to have received the sectmaster&rsquo;s acknowledgment. That was the one thing he had been hoping for when he entered the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not blessing your relationship. It&rsquo;s just that I can see that you have mutual feelings for one another, so I&rsquo;m reluctant to forcefully split the two of you apart. Besides, it&rsquo;s with your own capability that you won Zi Ling&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; the sectmaster said.<br>Chu Feng suddenly realized that the sectmaster might have already found out about their relationship a long time ago. Did this mean that everything she had done was just to test him?<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I came here to inform you that there&rsquo;s an opportunity available, and you&rsquo;re eligible for you. Do you wish to take it on?&rdquo; the sectmaster asked.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, may I know what kind of opportunity it is?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rare opportunity that&rsquo;s unlikely to come by twice. You need not ask anything more than that. You just have to tell me if you&rsquo;re willing to accept it or not,&rdquo; the sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to accept this opportunity,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied without hesitation.<br>If the sectmaster truly wanted to deal with him, there was no reason for her to beat around the bush. So, he wanted to believe that the opportunity she was offering was indeed a true opportunity.<br>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; the sectmaster said before starting to walk away.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, is Zi Ling not coming along?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Zi Ling is eligible too, but she offended someone whom she shouldn&rsquo;t have here and is unable to head there now,&rdquo; the sectmaster replied.<br>&ldquo;Are you referring to the elder who has shackled Zi Ling to this place? If that&rsquo;s the case, it isn&rsquo;t an issue anymore,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br>The sectmaster stared at Chu Feng with a deep gaze.<br>Meanwhile, Zi Ling&rsquo;s face glowed in delight.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, did you clear that elder&rsquo;s challenge?&rdquo;<br>Zi Ling stared at him with eyes filled with anticipation, as if she was waiting for him to give her an affirmative answer.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t manage to clear his challenge, but I was lucky to win his acknowledgment. You should be able to leave this place now, but of course, we would need Lord Sectmaster&rsquo;s approval too.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng turned his eyes toward the sectmaster as he said those words.<br>While Zi Ling was indeed shackled to this land due to the mysterious existence, it was still the sectmaster who had chosen to lock her up here in the first place. So, she would need the sectmaster&rsquo;s approval if she wanted to leave this place.<br>&ldquo;Does Zi Ling wish to go too?&rdquo; the sectmaster asked.<br>&ldquo;Master, I would like to go too,&rdquo; Zi Ling replied with a nod.<br>She would be willing to go anywhere as long as she was with Chu Feng.<br>Instead of answering Zi Ling&rsquo;s question, the sectmaster turned to Chu Feng instead and said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re more capable than I thought.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was surprised to hear those words.<br>&ldquo;Zi Ling rarely acts in this way,&rdquo; the sectmaster said before leaving the area.<br>Even though she didn&rsquo;t give a direct answer to Zi Ling&rsquo;s question, her attitude was more than enough to hint at her approval.<br>Chu Feng and Zi Ling exchanged a smile before quickly leaving the area together with Yu Ting.<br>Initially, Zi Ling was still worried whether the shackles had really been removed or not. It was not that she didn&rsquo;t trust Chu Feng, but she was worried that the mysterious existence might have reneged on his promise.<br>However, this worry was swiftly absolved when they walked out of the Abandoned Land without a hitch.<br>But right outside the Abandoned Land, they realized that there were two people waiting for them. One of them was the mysterious Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple, who appeared to know Chu Feng even though the latter didn&rsquo;t remember him.<br>The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple was an enigmatic individual with a mysterious background, but Chu Feng had a high impression of him due to him offering his position to Chu Feng during the matchmaking convention.<br>The other one was someone whom Chu Feng felt hostile toward.<br>Zuoqiu Youyu.<br>It was clear that the two of them would be accompanying them on this journey.<br>&ldquo;Hoh, isn&rsquo;t that our Junior Zi Ling? You&rsquo;re indeed as beautiful as a fairy. Aiya, I&rsquo;m starting to regret my decision. Why did I give up someone as beautiful as you to Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Unexpectedly, the one who first started provoking him was the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple whom he had a good impression of.<br>&ldquo;Master, is it too late for regret now?&rdquo;<br>The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple turned to the sectmaster and asked.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense. Zi Lingis already betrothed to Chu Feng. Hurry up and apologize to Zi Ling and Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>It was yet another surprising sight. The sectmaster actually berated the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple harshly and even told him to apologize to the two of them.<br>&ldquo;Junior Zi Ling, don&rsquo;t look at me like that. I&rsquo;m just joking. I do admire Junior Chu Feng greatly. If you don&rsquo;t believe it, you should ask him yourself!&rdquo;<br>The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple didn&rsquo;t apologize, but his light-hearted tone made it clear that he was just jesting with them. Nevertheless, Zi Ling still continued glaring at him with eyes filled with enmity.<br>At the same time, Zi Ling sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng to ask about the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple&rsquo;s affairs.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t mention the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple wanting to &lsquo;settle scores&rsquo; with him because he didn&rsquo;t want to worry her, but he did tell her that the latter had a mysterious background and that it was best to remain guarded against him.<br>&ldquo;Rather than the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple, you should be wary of Zuoqiu Youyu,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never liked those two brothers, but it sounds like you had an unpleasant history with them?&rdquo; Zi Ling asked.<br>&ldquo;You can say so. He tried to kill me once, and he&rsquo;d definitely try again if he ever gets a chance to,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br>Zi Ling&rsquo;s eyes filled with murderous intent.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell your master about it. She knows about it too, but it&rsquo;s hard to do anything about it without concrete evidence on hand. Don&rsquo;t make a fuss about it either. I&rsquo;ll also get rid of him if an opportunity arises,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Zi Ling retracted her killing intent upon hearing those words, but the way she looked at Zuoqiu Youyu was still vastly different from before. If she got a chance, she also wouldn&rsquo;t let Zuoqiu Youyu walk away alive.<br>Of course, their discussions were held through voice transmission, so no one could hear the content of their conversation.<br>Soon, under the lead of the sectmaster, the four of them arrived at a forbidden area. There was an old teleportation formation in the midst of this forbidden area.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes lit up right away the moment he saw the teleportation formation.<br>He had seen plenty of powerful teleportation formations from the Ancient Era, but he had never seen anything that compared to the one before him. The spirit power harnessed inside the formation was so dense that it was indubitably the strongest teleportation formation he had ever seen.<br>What was even more amazing was that even though this teleportation formation was old, it wasn&rsquo;t from the Ancient Era. It came after that.<br>This was definitely the means of the sect founder.<br>&ldquo;What a formidable teleportation formation. Master, where are you taking us too?&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple asked.<br>&ldquo;The Seven Realms Galaxy,&rdquo; the sectmaster replied.<br></p></div>
