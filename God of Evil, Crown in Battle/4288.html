        <h1>Chapter 4287</h1>
        <div> - Decided To Kill<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That does not seem like words spoken at random.<br>At the same time those words were said, a strifling oppression appeared out of the blue.<br>Furthermore, the teleportation formation was also sealed.<br>The current situation was extremely dangerous.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I know that your cultivation is very powerful and far superior to ours.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For us to show up uninvited, it is indeed quite offending.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, I believe that someone like you was most definitely a reasonable individual too. You couldn&rsquo;t possibly be deciding to end our lives just because we came unsolicited, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, we are from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. This person here is our Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s young master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If possible we truly hope Milord will be willing to give our Immortal Sea Fish Clan face.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We truly do not hold any malice in coming here. We really only wanted to inquire about some things,&rdquo; Lady Gusu spoke with a stern voice.<br>She was putting up a brave front. Truth was, she was feeling extremely panicky.<br>The reason for that was because she knew that giant face was truly capable of easily killing them.<br>They were currently inside the tiger&rsquo;s den.<br>Because of that, she had no choice but to use the name of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan to protect them.<br>But, she didn&rsquo;t dare to act arrogant. Instead, she was trying to reason.<br>Everything points toward the giant face being a demonic being from the Ancient Era.<br>An existence like that would generally be daring to do anything.<br>As such, one must be flexible and not forceful when confronted with an existence like that.<br>&ldquo;Tsk, tsk, tsk&hellip;&rdquo;<br>But, Lady Gusu&rsquo;s words were met with a sneering laughter.<br>&ldquo;The modern era cultivators are all ants. Who cares if you're a fish clan or shrimp clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If this Exalted allowed for you to come, even even if you overturned the seas and rivers, this Exalted will not blame you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, if one is to enter this Exalted&rsquo;s territory without this Exalted&rsquo;s permission, then only death awaits them.&rdquo;<br>After that giant face finished saying those words, wind and clouds began to surge. Lightning flashes and thunder rolls. Boundless killing intent filled the surroundings and black clouds covered the entire sky.<br>Faced with that sort of oppression, fear appeared in even Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s eyes.<br>As for Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er, she was so terrified that she ended up closing her eyes.<br>She knew that trying to flee would not work against an existence like that. If their opponent was truly determined to kill, only death will await them.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please wait,&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment of imminent peril, Xianhai Shaoyu spoke with an unflustered tone.<br>Not only that, he even walked before Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er and Xianhao Gusu and shielded them behind him as he spoke.<br>&ldquo;You still have more last words?&rdquo; asked that terrifying existence.<br>&ldquo;Entering this place was my decision.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It had nothing to do with them. Is it possible for you to spare them?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite an upright and loyal person.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, this Exalted had said that all of you will die. Thus, all of you must die,&rdquo; said that terrifying existence.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you&rsquo;ve been staying in this place for many years and doesn&rsquo;t understand the modern era.<br>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t look down upon the modern era&rsquo;s cultivators.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If senior insists on killing us for a matter as trivial as this, I&rsquo;m afraid that senior might end up regretting it.&rdquo;<br>As Xianhai Shaoyu spoke, he undid his clothes. Light emerged from within the undone clothes.<br>On his chest was a red gem. That gem seemed to be constructed of blood. There was some sort of substance circulating through it too. It seemed like something living was inside it.<br>From a glance, one would think it was a treasure. But, upon closer inspection, one will realize that it was truly strange.<br>The red gem was connected with Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s heart and pulsing following the rhythm of his heartbeat. It seemed like it was fused with Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>The surroundings of that strange gem was covered in complicated yuet mysterious vein lines. It was those vein lines that emitted the light.<br>But, those vein lines were clearly all black in color!<br>&ldquo;Lord young master, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing that light, Lady Gusu&rsquo;s expression turned very complicated.<br>As a member of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, she knew what the item on Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s chest was.<br>That was a protective formation.<br>It was something that would only trigger when Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s life was in danger.<br>Xianhai Shaoyu was always a strong-willed person. He always preferred to journey through the vast martial cultivation world using his own power. Even if others were accompanying him, he would not permit those that accompanied him to be stronger than him.<br>But, as the most powerful genius of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, as the heir to their Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s King, the Immortal Sea Fish Clan would naturally not allow Xianhai Shaoyu to leave the vicinity of their clan without anything to ensure his safety.<br>Because of that, through meditation, Xianhai Shaoyu agreed to allow their clan to put a protective formation on him.<br>That protective formation will trigger when Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s life is in danger.<br>Its destructive power was extremely strong.<br>But, as that protective formation was connected with Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s soul, he will also suffer damages should the protective formation be triggered.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, Xianhai Gusu and Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er were both shaken.<br>They both felt Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s aura entering their bodies.<br>At this moment, they realized that Xianhai Shaoyu was really planning to put forth a life and death struggle.<br>After Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s aura enters their bodies, the protective formation will be able to distinguish them and not attack them when it is activated.<br>&ldquo;Protective formation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you threatening this Exalted?&rdquo;<br>The terrifying existence&rsquo;s voice grew increasingly displeased. Evidently, an existence of that caliber would be able to tell how powerful Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s protective formation was.<br>&ldquo;This is not a threat. It&rsquo;s just that this spirit formation is on me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you want to kill me, you&rsquo;ll have to breach it first,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, I will breach your spirit formation first before killing you.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, surging black clouds appeared out of thin air. Overflowing killing intent followed after.<br>Even though that terrifying existence had seen realized how dangerous Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s protective formation was, it was not afraid in the slightest and still insisted on killing Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>At this moment, not to mention Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er, even Lady Gusu closed her eyes.<br>Neither of them were able to influence the situation when confronted with an existence of this caliber.<br>They could only leave everything to Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s protective formation.<br>They hoped that the protective formation would be able to obliterate the Ancient Era&rsquo;s demonic being in the sky.<br>Although the activation of the protective formation will seriously injure Xianhai Shaoyu, there was no other alternative for them right now.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Xianhai Shaoyu, Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er and Xianhai Gusu&rsquo;s surroundings froze.<br>It was not only the three of them that were frozen in place. Everything around them was frozen in place. It seemed as if time had stopped moving around them.<br>At the same time, an invisible barrier appeared around them.<br>While that barrier was invisible, it shielded the three of them inside it.<br>No matter how the black clouds surged around them, no matter how terrifying the roars of the clouds were, no matter how devastating the attacks were, they were all unable to breach that invisible barrier, unable to injure Xianhai Shaoyu, Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er and Xianhai Gusu in the slightest.<br>Seeing this, the terrifying giant face in the sky revealed a change in expression.<br>Its eyes that were able to pierce through the surroundings looked to a distant location in this world.<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re already here, why not show yourself?!&rdquo;<br>A thunderous voice sounded from the giant terrifying face.<br>&ldquo;Huu, huu, huu---&rdquo;<br>After it finished saying those words, the weather in the distant location it was looking at began to change.<br>An invisible power swept forth from afar.<br>That was&hellip; an oppressive might!<br></p></div>
