        <div> - Fish On The Chopping Block<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;That outfit. That terrifying air.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Could it be that those are really people from the Blood-devouring Hall?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the eight peculiarly clothed individuals, not only were the Chu Heavenly Clansmen scared, but even the hidden bystanders turned deathly pale from fear. Some among them even started to tremble. Those among them that were more cowardly did not even dare to continue to stay to observe, and turned around to flee.<br>The infamy of the Blood-devouring Hall was simply too resounding.<br>To many people, the people from the Blood-devouring Hall were simply not cultivators.<br>Instead, they were a bunch of demons from hell, a bunch of homicidal maniac demons.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually people from the Blood-devouring Hall?&rdquo;<br>Compared to the Chu Heavenly Clan and the ordinary bystanders, the crusading army that were crushed by the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and were planning to flee were extremely joyous.<br>They had journeyed there with the intention to suppress the Chu Heavenly Clan. Unfortunately, they had not known the true cultivation of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, and suffered a miserable defeat.<br>Originally, they had decided to escape from that place.<br>Never did they expect people from the Blood-devouring Hall to appear at such a time. The appearance of the Blood-devouring Hall came as a ray of hope to them. Thus, they who were planning to escape decided not to flee, and instead stay to watch.<br>&ldquo;The ones that ought to come have finally come.&rdquo;<br>Compared to the others, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief closed his eyes and sighed in his heart.<br>He knew very well that the people that Chu Xuanyuan had offended were definitely not limited to those mobs.<br>However, the Blood-devouring Hall was definitely not among the people that Chu Xuanyuan had offended either.<br>Thus, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief knew that someone had entrusted the Blood-devouring Hall with being here.<br>The Blood-devouring Hall was only here to cause trouble for the Chu Heavenly Clan because they had been paid to do so.<br>&ldquo;May I know why everyone from the Blood-devouring Hall has decided to come to my Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>Even though he knew that the Blood-devouring Hall had come with ill-intentions, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief still had a very amiable attitude.<br>However, even though the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had an amiable attitude, he was met with sneers from the Blood-devouring Hall.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Chu, since you know our purpose in coming, why bother asking?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, you will be given two choices.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your first choice is to hand over Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your second choice is to have all of your Chu Heavenly Clansmen be buried with him.&rdquo;<br>A person from the Blood-devouring Hall spoke.<br>His attitude was extremely arrogant. Even though they were all peak Exalted, he did not put the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief in his eyes at all.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the Blood-devouring Hall was actually so direct, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief let out a chuckle. Then, his expression turned stern, and boundless killing intent was emitted from his body.<br>&ldquo;I am truly apologetic. Neither of the choices you have proposed are choices that this old man plans to make.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, a Heaven-level Lightning Mark appeared on his forehead.<br>After the Heaven-level Lightning Mark appeared, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s battle power increased.<br>Although he was still unable to break into the Utmost Exalted realm, his battle power was extremely terrifying even amongst peak Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Huuu~~~&rdquo;<br>At practically the same instant as the Heaven-level Lightning Mark appeared, boundless martial power was emitted from the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>It was no ordinary martial power. Instead, it was an Immortal Technique. As the martial power filled the sky, an enormous cage appeared. The cage sealed the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief himself.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Following that, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief took the initiative to attack. Alone, he rushed toward the eight.<br>&ldquo;Boom, boom, boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Rumbles began to spread out everywhere as energy ripples wreaked havoc all around.<br>Those were no ordinary energy ripples. Instead, they were energy ripples caused by a battle between peak Exalted-level experts.<br>To many people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the energy ripples were capable of utter destruction.<br>That said, the powerful energy ripples were all sealed in one place. They were all sealed within the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s Immortal Technique cage.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was not only facing eight peak Exalted-level experts by himself, but he had also used an Immortal Technique to contain the energy ripples, so as to not implicate the others.<br>&ldquo;So powerful. Never would I have imagined the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to actually be this powerful.&rdquo;<br>Even though the crowd were simply unable to see the details of the battle between the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s eight experts, they were both terrified and astonished by the energy ripples wreaking havoc throughout the cage.<br>They knew that if the energy ripples were released from the cage, many among them would find it very difficult to escape alive.<br>The reason why they were not implicated by the energy ripples was all due to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Because of that, many experts of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm began to feel great respect and reverence for the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Lord Vice Hall Master, what should we do? We can&rsquo;t possibly allow Lord Clan Chief to take on the people from the Blood-devouring Hall alone while we watch with folded arms, no?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, many people turned their gazes to Chu Xuanzhengfa and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elders.<br>They were all panicking. After all, this was a battle that would determine the existence of their Chu Heavenly Clan. They naturally did not wish to be mere observers.<br>&ldquo;That is not a battle that we can participate in. Besides, those over there are still eyeing us covetously.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, worry and alertness filled the eyes of Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Hanpeng.<br>Their worries were understandable.<br>Even though the crusading army did not attack the Chu Heavenly Clan again, they did not leave either. Instead, they were eyeing the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief's battle against the eight Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s experts like tigers watching their prey.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa knew very well that they were surveying the situation. If the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief won the battle, they would immediately disperse.<br>However, if the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief lost, they would immediately join hands with the Blood-devouring Hall and charge their way into the Chu Heavenly Clan to massacre the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>Most importantly, facing such a situation, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were powerless to do anything.<br>Their Lord Clan Chief was the only person that was capable of deterring the mob.<br>If the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was defeated, the others from the Chu Heavenly Clan would not be able to obstruct the crusading army at all, much less the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a scream was heard.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Following that, a loud explosion was heard. Someone had broken the cage containing the energy ripples.<br>Like unrestrained tigers, the energy ripples began to wreak havoc all over. Screams began to be heard from all over. Even those with strong cultivations were blown away by the energy ripples and suffered minor injuries.<br>However, those with weak cultivations were simply unable to withstand the power of the energy ripples.<br>In less serious cases, they were bleeding from all seven facial orifices, and suffered injuries to their souls. In more serious cases, their bodies exploded on the spot, killing them.<br>Fortunately, although the energy ripples were terrifying, they did not cause any harm to the Chu Heavenly Clansmen. The ones that suffered the most from the energy ripples were the spectators that had hidden nearby.<br>The reason why such terrifying energy ripples did not cause harm to any Chu Heavenly Clansmen was because of a single individual, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. He had forcibly blocked the energy ripples from spreading into the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was no longer in the cage, and was standing before the army of Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>However, there were not only bloodstains present on both corners of his mouth, but there was also a fist-sized hole in his left chest. His left chest had been pierced through, and blood was flowing out nonstop.<br>Most importantly, that was no ordinary wound, as that wound had damaged even his soul. Otherwise, someone like the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief couldn&rsquo;t possibly be unable to heal it. Besides that, his complexion was deathly pale. Even standing seemed somewhat difficult.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was seriously injured. However, even with that being the case, he still used his strength to protect his clansmen.<br>Seeing that their Lord Clan Chief was so seriously injured, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen all had dejected expressions on their faces. Despair filled their eyes. Some among them even closed their eyes, and prepared themselves to face death.<br>Their Lord Clan Chief was seriously injured, whereas the eight from the Blood-devouring Hall were completely unscathed.<br>The situation of the battle was extremely obvious. No matter how powerful their Lord Clan Chief might be, he was evidently no match for the eight evildoers of the Blood-devouring Hall.<br>When even their Lord Clan Chief was no match for those eight evildoers, how could they possibly be able to do anything?<br>At that moment, they could only wait for death like fish on a chopping block.<br></p></div>
