        <div> - Who Gave It To You<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Your Highness Yu&rsquo;er, what happened?&rdquo;<br>Those twenty-four palace guards thought that something had happened.<br>However, when they discovered that it was actually Xianhai Shuoyi who was crushed into the cliff by the young woman&rsquo;s oppressive might, they were all stunned and confused.<br>After all, they knew very well that even though Xianhai Shuoyi had a very lowly status, he possessed a very good relationship with the young woman, as they&rsquo;d grown up together.<br>They did not understand who could possibly make the young woman so angry that she would treat Xianhai Shuoyi in such a manner.<br>That said, as they knew that the relationship between Xianhai Shuoyi and the young woman was generally very good, they did not attack Xianhai Shuoyi even after knowing that he had offended the young woman.<br>They all knew very well that the matter should be left for the young woman to personally handle due to Xianhai Shuoyi&rsquo;s special status.<br>&ldquo;Xianhai Shuoyi, there are words that I&rsquo;ve wanted to tell you for a very long time now. Although we have grown up together and are friends of many years&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The young woman suddenly turned around. She had a very serious expression on her face, &ldquo;...however, I have always only considered you to be my older brother. Thus, do not misunderstand my affection for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, I have warned you before. I do not allow anyone to speak ill of what I am fond of.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You want to know where I obtained this footlace? Very well, I can tell you. It was given to me by a friend of mine.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, it is only an Elite Armament. However, I just so happen to be fond of wearing it. I will not allow anyone to speak ill of it.&rdquo;<br>Although the young woman spoke those words sternly, she removed her oppressive might from Xianhai Shuoyi.<br>Without the pressure from the oppressive might, Xianhai Shuoyi was finally able to stand up.<br><br>At that moment, he did not concern himself with the dust on his body at all. With an apologetic expression on his face, he said to the young woman, &ldquo;Yu&rsquo;er, I was wrong. I should not shoot off my mouth. It is good that you like it. I will never again&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There is no next time,&rdquo; The young woman said.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Xianhai Shuoyi was startled. Then, he said, &ldquo;Yu&rsquo;er, w-w-what do you mean by that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Palace guards, listen up!&rdquo; Suddenly, the young woman shouted.<br>&ldquo;We are listening!&rdquo; The twenty-four enormously powerful palace guards all half-kneeled onto the ground.<br>&ldquo;From today on, unless I personally request for him, Xianhai Shuoyi is not allowed to enter where I&rsquo;m staying at will,&rdquo; The young woman declared.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Your Highness!&rdquo; The twenty-four guards spoke in unison. Their voices were extremely resounding.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br><br>After she finished giving the order, the young woman soared into the sky. She was walking in the sky barefooted.<br><br>Although the young woman&rsquo;s movement appeared to be very elegant and slow, her speed was extremely fast. In merely the blink of an eye, she had disappeared into the distant horizon.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Following that, twenty-three of the guards all soared into the sky to follow after her.<br><br>Only one of the palace guards was still standing on the ground.<br>&ldquo;Yu&rsquo;er, wait, let me explain, I truly did not have any ill intentions.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, Xianhai Shuoyi immediately started to panic. He wanted to chase after the young woman.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a powerful energy suddenly restricted him. Then, that power pinned him to the cliff once again.<br>It was the palace guard that had stayed behind. As for that palace guard, it was the same middle-aged man that had allowed Xianhai Shuoyi inside.<br>&ldquo;Release me! Let me go after Yu&rsquo;er!&rdquo; Xianhai Shouyi spoke anxiously.<br>&ldquo;Insolent! That is Her Highness Yu&rsquo;er! How could you address her by name?!&rdquo;<br>The middle-aged man shouted at Xianhai Shuoyi sternly. He no longer showed any sort of politeness from before.<br>&ldquo;Scram! Who the hell do you think you are to dare block my path?! Do you know my relationship with Yu&rsquo;er?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I am to mention this matter to Yu&rsquo;er, she will immediately remove your status as a palace guard!&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Shuoyi was extremely furious. He had already lost all sense of propriety, removed his hypocritical mask and actually spoke what he wanted to say in his mind the most.<br>&ldquo;Paa, paa~~~&rdquo;<br>The middle-aged man raised his hand and gave Xianhai Shuoyi two slaps. Although those slaps were sent forth from afar, they ruthlessly landed onto Xianhai Shuoyi&rsquo;s face.<br>After the two slaps landed, Xianhai Shuoyi&rsquo;s cheeks were both lacerated. His handsome face had been slapped beyond recognition.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;!&rdquo; Xianhai Shuoyi was stunned. After verifying the pain on his cheeks, he said, &ldquo;You dare hit me?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I dare? What sort of status do I possess, and what sort of status do you possess? Yet you dare speak to me in such a manner?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, I am already being lenient by only giving you two slaps to the face. Else, how could you still be able to lay there?&rdquo;<br><br>That middle-aged man did not show any anger. However, his overwhelming oppressive might surged forth, oppressing Xianhai Shuoyi to a state of being unable to breathe easily.<br>There was simply no need for him to attack. Merely a single thought from the middle-aged man would be able to completely obliterate Xianhai Shuoyi.<br>In such a situation, Xianhai Shuoyi gradually regained his calm. He did not dare utter another word.<br>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; The middle-aged man let out a cold snort. Then, he soared into the sky.<br>However, upon reaching the sky, he suddenly stopped, turned around and said to Xianhai Shuoyi mockingly, &ldquo;Brainless trash, do you really think that you can see Her Highness Yu&rsquo;er again? You have already intruded upon her baseline. From today on, you and Her Highness Yu&rsquo;er will be people from two separate worlds. You will no longer be associated with her again.&rdquo;<br><br>After saying those words, that middle-aged man sneered. Then, he continued to fly toward the direction that the young woman left in.<br><br>At that moment, Xianhai Shuoyi was stunned. He remained silent for a very long time.<br>After a long time passed, Xianhai Shuoyi was finally able to somewhat alleviate himself. However, at that time, overwhelming hatred emerged in his eyes.<br>With a voice that only he could hear, he muttered, &ldquo;Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er, I never expected you to be this heartless.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Very well, since you want to break all ties, I will also not wag my tail, beg for pity and lower myself to curry your favor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if I am to leave you, the so-called Her Highness Princess, I, Xianhai Shuoyi, with my own abilities, will still be able to make a name for myself in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan.&rdquo;<br>Only Xianhai Shuoyi was able to hear those complaint-filled words. However, the scene of him saying those words was caught by two individuals.<br>Away from and above that seven-colored lake was a floating palace.<br>That palace was very peculiar. Although the palace was not very large, it was completely composed of bright and shiny green gemstone. It gave off a special sort of beauty.<br>In the center of the palace was a ten meter-tall mirror. On that mirror was Xianhai Shuoyi&rsquo;s ugly and grievance-filled face.<br>Furthermore, the words Xianhai Shuoyi muttered earlier were all revealed by the mirror.<br>Her Highness Yu&rsquo;er was standing right before the mirror. Seeing that scene, anger emerged in her previously clear eyes.<br>She was angered. She was tightly clenching her lily-white fists. She was biting down so hard on her pearly white teeth that creaking noises could be heard.<br>However, she did not say a single word.<br>Suddenly, a figure approached her. It was a young man with a very handsome appearance. It was a very manly sort of handsomeness.<br><br>Even when compared with Xianhai Shuoyi, he was much more handsome.<br>Furthermore, that young man was very tall. He was wearing a special sort of armor, and appeared very imposing and domineering. It was as if he was emitting the aura of a ruler from every pore on his body.<br>Furthermore, if one were to pay close attention, they would notice that the man&rsquo;s appearance slightly resembled that of Her Highness Yu&rsquo;er.<br><br>&ldquo;My little sister, do you now know the true colors of that Xianhai Shuoyi?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have already told you that he had only approached you for his personal benefit,&rdquo; The man said.<br><br>&ldquo;Actually, I already knew that such was the case. Merely, I am still unable to contain my anger after seeing it personally.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, I had sincerely considered him my friend before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, big brother, you do not have to worry about me. I will not take something like this to heart.&rdquo;<br>Her Highness Yu&rsquo;er turned around and looked at the man. At that moment, she revealed a witty and pleasant smile on her refined little face.<br>It was as if everything that had happened before was already in the past, and her current negative mood would not affect her much.<br>&ldquo;Although that Xianhai Shuoyi approached little sister for his own benefits, he is indeed fond of you from the bottom of his heart. Even earlier, his hatred was only borne of love.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, you have treated him quite well too. Even if you&rsquo;ve only considered him an older brother, you&rsquo;ve still treated him very well.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, ever since you&rsquo;ve returned from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, you&rsquo;ve completely changed. Especially toward him&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although the relationship between the two of you is still very good in the eyes of others, it is no longer as intimate as before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I, your older brother, am also very curious as to exactly who gave you that footlace of yours to be able to change a mischievous girl like you,&rdquo; The man asked with a beaming smile.<br>He was looking at Her Highness Yu&rsquo;er with a very gentle and soft gaze. It was filled with love and pampering.<br>That said, he was also truly curious.<br>He really wanted to know who gave his little sister that footlace.<br><br></p></div>
