        <h1>Chapter 2109</h1>
        <div> - Incomplete Ancestral Armament<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Trash, why aren&rsquo;t you saying anything? Are you scared speechless by my martial skill?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I might as well tell you. This is an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I bet a country bumpkin like you has never heard of Emperor Taboo Martial Skills before, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no problem. Today, I shall show you great kindness, and teach you some knowledge.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Emperor Taboo Martial Skills are martial skills that Martial Emperors cannot use. As its name implies, Emperor Taboo Martial Skill are a taboo for Martial Emperors.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, only actual Half Martial Ancestors are capable of learning Emperor Taboo Martial Skills.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, this Hall Master is a genius. Although I am still only a Martial Emperor, I have already mastered this Emperor Taboo Martial Skill that is a taboo for Martial Emperors,&rdquo; The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master spoke in an immensely proud manner to Chu Feng. His tone was filled with a sense of superiority.<br>&ldquo;You should have only just grasped that Emperor Taboo Martial Skill, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Hearing those words, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was startled. His gaze turned complicated. Cautiously, he asked, &ldquo;What is it that you&rsquo;re trying to say?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to say that your Emperor Taboo Martial Skill should be extremely powerful. However, it seems that you have yet to completely grasp it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Look at it. That huge beast the Emperor Taboo Martial Skill creates should be extremely domineering and mighty. It should give off the sensation of the descent of a ruler upon appearing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, look at it. It doesn&rsquo;t even have arms or legs. All it has is a single mouth. It looks like an utter joke. It gives off absolutely no sense of dominance at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus&hellip; it is truly a pity for that Emperor Taboo Martial Skill to be defiled by you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Bastard! Are you mocking me?&rdquo; The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master asked furiously.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, I am,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a laugh.<br>&ldquo;Snap~~~&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master immediately clenched his fists angrily. His furious gaze seemed to be capable of shooting out flames. He was truly infuriated by Chu Feng.<br>However, his anger lasted only a moment. After that moment, he started to laugh strangely. He said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m changing my plans. Today, I will not kill you. Instead, I will make you wish that you were dead. I will make you beg me, kneel before me and beg me to kill you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking too much of yourself. You are incapable of doing that,&rdquo; Chu Feng said mockingly.<br>&ldquo;You will soon know whether or not I am capable,&rdquo; After the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s words left his mouth, the huge beast in the sky suddenly opened its mouth. Immediately, a violent suction began to suck Chu Feng into its mouth.<br>&ldquo;Crap! If Chu Feng is to be sucked into that giant beast&rsquo;s mouth, it will definitely be disastrous!&rdquo; Seeing that scene, the Elf King, Xian Miaomiao and the others were all deeply frightened.<br>&ldquo;Your struggle is useless. Right now&hellip; you are nothing more than a puppet. I will be able to toy with you however I wish,&rdquo; The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master laughed mockingly.<br>&ldquo;That guy.&rdquo;<br>However, his laughter suddenly froze. The reason for that was because he was shocked to discover that Chu Feng was not struggling against that suction power at all. Just like that, he allowed himself to be sucked into that giant beast&rsquo;s mouth.<br>Although Chu Feng was confident, the people that were concerned about his safety were nearly driven mad. For example, Xian Miaomiao and some other girls were crying already.<br>&ldquo;Heeaahh!!!&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly shouted explosively. Then, he raised one hand up and shot an explosive fist toward the giant beast in the sky.<br>&ldquo;Snap~~~&rdquo;<br>A loud sound was heard. The sound of something shattering actually sounded from the sky covered by that huge beast.<br>&ldquo;Snap~~~ Snap~~~ Snap~~~&rdquo;<br>Soon, the shattering sounds grew more and more numerous. At that moment, the crowd discovered that countless giant cracks had appeared on that enormous beast&rsquo;s vast body. Those cracks were rapidly extending and interweaving with one another.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Soon, a loud sound that was never before heard sounded. Then, that beast shattered into pieces. Like countless meteorites, its shattered body began to fall from the sky.<br>Merely, as its body was formed with martial power, it did not land on the ground. Instead, they turned into streams of martial power that assimilated into the void.<br>Although the sky was extremely frightening before, it was very beautiful now.<br>Most importantly, although the giant beast that covered the sky had been destroyed, a special sort of power was still hovering in the sky. Merely, no one had discovered that power.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, Chu Feng, he&hellip; he actually managed to destroy the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s Emperor Taboo Martial Skill.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, even the Elf King and the others were stunned. To them, it seemed as if Chu Feng had only shot a punch toward the beast. How could a single punch possess such power?<br>[1. Xima: Bee, Chu Feng is not One-punch Man; /HmWDsHkfTFyShq7GqbE1_b01.png]<br>Their astonishment was understandable. After all, they did not know that Chu Feng had learned many Heaven Taboo Martial Skills, and even an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill from Qing Xuantian&rsquo;s inheritance.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s fist strike earlier was no ordinary fist strike. Instead, it was an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill.<br>&ldquo;Impossible, this is impossible!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You, trash that grew up in this land, how could you have possibly grasped an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master reacted as if he had received an enormous shock. Although others were unable to tell, he was able to tell that Chu Feng had used an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill earlier.<br>However, that was something that he was unwilling to admit, something that he could not accept. He had spent great difficulty in order to learn that Emperor Taboo Martial Skill. Yet, Chu Feng actually knew an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill too.<br>Most importantly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s mastery of his Emperor Taboo Martial Skill was actually much more skillful than his own. Chu Feng had managed to easily destroy his own Emperor Taboo Martial Skill.<br>&ldquo;Rumble, rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, rumbles began to sound from the sky. Turning their heads toward the sky, the crowd was all stunned and felt utter disbelief.<br>At that moment, many rays of light appeared in the sky. Those lights were interweaving with one another and covering the entire sky.<br>Most importantly, those lights emitted an aura even more frightening than the aura emitted by that huge beast earlier.<br>&ldquo;This is the Emperor Taboo Martial Skill, Emperor Taboo: Heavenly Dome Transformation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In this Lower Realm that you look down upon, this Martial Skill was learned by someone ten thousand years ago,&rdquo; Chu Feng said mockingly.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, so Chu Feng actually also grasped a legendary Emperor Taboo Martial Skill. No wonder, no wonder he was able to easily destroy the Dark Hall Hall Master&rsquo;s Emperor Taboo Martial Skill.&rdquo;<br>The crowd burst into an uproar. Seeing the light that filled the sky, the crowd reacted as if they had seen hope. They felt that regardless of how powerful the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master might be, he would still be defeated today.<br>Merely, before that, no one had expected that Chu Feng would make such an enormous improvement.<br>&ldquo;Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, what other tricks do you have? Feel free to use them. Else&hellip; I will be ending you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hehehe&hellip;.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wahahahahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master burst into frantic laughter. His laughter was extremely frightening. It simply did not sound like the voice of a human.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I truly never expected that trash like you would be able to force this Hall Master into such a state.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, that&rsquo;s fine. I shall let you all know exactly how powerful the strength this Hall Master really has.&rdquo;<br>After the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said those words, his wrist started to shine brightly. It was only at that moment that the crowd discovered he had a bracelet on his wrist.<br>That bracelet was emitting dazzling golden light. At that moment, that bracelet flew off of the wrist of the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master and began to float before him.<br>As that bracelet shone with brightness, an aura even more powerful than the Emperor Taboo Martial Skill swept forth.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Upon seeing that bracelet, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes also shone.<br>He had already realized that that bracelet was an extraordinary item, and should be an Incomplete Ancestral Armament.<br><br></p></div>
