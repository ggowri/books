        <div> - Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Little sister Kong Ci, we were merely joking around,&rdquo; someone said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Right, we were merely joking around,&rdquo; the others also smiled and echoed that person.<br>Their expressions were utterly different than when they had met Kong Tianhui.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng confirmed that that woman was indeed the strongest person of the Divine Body Royal City&rsquo;s younger generations, Kong Ci.<br>&ldquo;Joking around? Did you all think I didn&rsquo;t see what happened earlier?&rdquo; Kong Ci swept her cold gaze across the crowd.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The crowd all turned pale with fear. Many people began to sweat beads of cold sweat.<br>It could be seen that they were extremely afraid of Kong Ci.<br>&ldquo;Forget about it, forget about it. We&rsquo;re all family, we couldn&rsquo;t really have them eat shit, no?&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the crowd were placed in a difficult situation, Kong Tianhui actually stood forth to speak out for them.Chu Feng was surprised by that.<br>After all, those people were being extremely overbearing earlier. Even Chu Feng felt that, even if they must cheat, they should be taught a lesson.<br>That was the reason why he felt so surprised,<br>Because of that, Chu Feng gained a new opinion of Kong Tianhui.<br>It would appear that he was different from what Chu Feng had imagined him to be.<br>&ldquo;However, Kong Feiyang, you must make sure to greet me respectfully when you see me in the future. Understood?&rdquo; Kong Tianhui pointed to Kong Feiyang.<br>Kong Feiyang completely ignored Kong Tianhui. He gritted his teeth angrily, and had a look of displeasure on his face.<br>&ldquo;My older brother is speaking to you, are you deaf?!&rdquo;<br>A furious shout was heard. It was Kong Ci.<br>Once Kong Ci shouted those words, Kong Feiyang and many of the others present all trembled with fear.<br>&ldquo;Kong Tianhui, I, Kong Feiyang, lost this time around. I will fulfill my promise,&rdquo; Kong Feiyang said to Kong Tianhui. Even though he was clearly feeling very unwilling, he still bowed respectfully to Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Are you all this free?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Have you all forgotten the purpose of this gathering?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why are you all still standing here? Go and survey the formation diagram, capture the opportunity to train. Could it be that you all want to be beaten by those Starfield Master Realm fellows?&rdquo;<br>Kong Ci&rsquo;s gaze was ice-cold. As she ran her eyes across the crowd, she spoke to criticize them.<br>Hearing that, those people immediately left, and started proceeding deeper into the villa.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from sighing<br>The status of this brother and sister in Divine Body Royal City was simply too different.<br>What Chu Feng was unable to understand the most was that even though Kong Tianhui was inferior to his younger sister Kong Ci, he was still pretty strong.<br>That said, Kong Tianhui was evidently accustomed to this. It would appear that it was not only a day or two that those people treated him like that.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, why are you such a coward? With the way they treated you, you should punish them. Otherwise&hellip; they won't change their behavior,&rdquo; Kong Ci said to Kong Tianhui.<br>Even though she appeared to be very displeased, she was feeling grievance for Kong Tianhui more than anything else.<br>Kong Tianhui sighed. &ldquo;I understand all of that. The reason why they&rsquo;re so against me is all because of my closeness with little sister Xian Yun and little sister Long Ning. They&rsquo;re just jealous of me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all because of how handsome I am.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since I am already this excellent, I shouldn&rsquo;t bicker with them too much.&rdquo;<br>Kong Tianhui fiddled with his hair as he said those words.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, can you grow some shame? The reason why you&rsquo;re able to be close with Xian Yun and Long Ning is all because you&rsquo;re my older brother, okay?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you really think the two of them would pay attention to you had you been on your own?&rdquo; Kong Ci looked to Kong Tianhui with a look of contempt.<br>&ldquo;No, this matter has nothing to do with you. It&rsquo;s mainly because I am handsome,&rdquo; Kong Tianhui spoke shamelessly. Then, he suddenly said, &ldquo;Oh, right. Let me introduce you two.&rdquo;<br>Kong Tianhui pulled Kong Ci over to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a need for introductions. Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, Chu Feng. In the Nine Dragons Upper Realm&rsquo;s selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars, he managed to tie with Linghu Hongfei.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve nearly forgotten, he&rsquo;s also the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist in our Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you truly have quite a lot of halos on you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, not to mention those people, even I do not believe that you'd lose to this foolish older brother of mine,&rdquo; Kong Ci said to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng smiled. However, he did not say anything in response.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re also someone from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, right?&rdquo; asked Kong Ci.<br>&ldquo;That seems to be a meaningless question, no?&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Then you should fight for the Ancestral Martial Starfield, no?&rdquo; Kong Ci continued.<br>&ldquo;Logically, that should be the case. Miss Kong Ci&rsquo;s words seemed to contain hidden implications. If there&rsquo;s anything you need, there&rsquo;s no harm in mentioning it directly,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Do you know about the All-heaven Gate?&rdquo; asked Kong Ci.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Do you know about the All-heaven Starfield?&rdquo; asked Kong Ci.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head again.<br>Kong Ci narrowed her brows, &ldquo;Do you not know anything?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the frowning Kong Ci, Kong Tianhui laughed and said, &ldquo;Little sister, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe me if I told you this but, before this, he didn&rsquo;t even know about you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is simply not ignorant anymore, this is simply being stupid.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I truly never would&rsquo;ve expected for Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son to be someone, although talented, to be so ignorant.&rdquo;<br>Kong Ci flung her arms and then walked away. Evidently&hellip; she felt very displeased.<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng stood there stunned. Then, he looked to Kong Tianhui, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? How come we&rsquo;re involved with fighting for the Ancestral Martial Starfield?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Haha. Brother Chu Feng, you don&rsquo;t know about this,&rdquo; Kong Tianhui laughed. Then, he placed his arm around Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulders and said to him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain things to you in detail.&rdquo;<br>Then, Kong Tianhui began to inform Chu Feng about everything.<br>It turned out, the All-heaven Starfield was another Starfield within the Holy Light Galaxy like the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>The All-heaven Starfield happened to be the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s neighbor. Thus, the two starfields had always had dealings with each other.<br>Of course, the dealings between two starfields were not things that ordinary cultivators would be able to be involved with. The dealings were interactions between peak powers, top cultivators and the strongest geniuses.<br>Since the Ancestral Martial Starfield had geniuses, it was inevitable that the All-heaven Starfield also had geniuses.<br>Furthermore, the geniuses from the two starfields would interact with each other every now and then.<br>The interaction between geniuses of the younger generation naturally meant that they would spar with one another.<br>However, the spars that they had in the past were not purely martial power showdowns. Instead, they were more like a game.<br>As for this game, it was the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess.<br>It was a match using the ground as the chessboard, and themselves as the chess pieces.<br>This Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess was not only a showdown using martial power, but it was also one that stressed one&rsquo;s resourcefulness and techniques.<br>It was worth mentioning that this showdown between the younger generations using the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess was suggested by the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>In simpler terms, the so-called Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess was a possession of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. It was the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s side that taught the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s people this Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess.<br>However, apart from the first several victories, the Ancestral Martial Starfield had lost every single round.<br>At present, the record was ten wins and a hundred and thirty-nine losses.<br>This battle record was extremely miserable. It could even be said to be very humiliating.<br>Thus, before the social interaction between the two starfield&rsquo;s younger generations, the Three Cities and the Starfield Master Realm&rsquo;s geniuses would all gather to make arrangements and study chess techniques in the hopes of defeating the All-heaven Starfield.<br>&ldquo;Thus, have you all won before?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Won? In all the times I&rsquo;ve participated, we&rsquo;ve never won once. You don&rsquo;t know exactly how terrifying those people from the All-heaven Starfield are. Being on the chessboard together with them, we're simply of different calibers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I truly wonder if they even bother with cultivation, and don&rsquo;t spend all day studying chess.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, their cultivations aren't weak either. This is especially true for that Nangong Yifang, that fellow is simply abnormal. His chess skills are simply astonishing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you know, last time around, we made full preparations. As for the All-heaven Starfield, many of their geniuses were either busy or injured. Thus, over half of them weren&rsquo;t present.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We thought that we would definitely win. We even thought that it would be a one-sided battle. Never would we have expected that, during the crucial moment, that Nangong Yifang suddenly appeared on the chessboard.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Most terrifying of all, he actually managed to lead a bunch of weaklings by himself and turned the situation around completely, forcing out a victory against us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, that was the only time he acted. He never went back on the chessboard afterwards. He simply does not place us in his eyes at all.&rdquo;<br>When mentioning Nangong Yifang, Kong Tianhui had a look of anger, admiration and, more than anything, awe.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng also became extremely curious about that Nangong Yifan.<br></p></div>
