        <div><span>: There&rsquo;s Something Special About This Lady</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>The lady had big black eyes and a fair complexion. She was dressed in a white dress, and her black hair was braided into a ponytail and fastened with a red string. She gave off an innocent yet mischievous feeling.</span><br><span>Chu Feng had seen his fair share of beauties, but the lady before him was definitely above average.</span><br><span>What especially caught his attention was the ornament hanging on her waist&mdash;a wind chime. Rarely did anyone use a wind chime as a personal ornament.</span><br><span>She was likely to be carrying a treasure that concealed her cultivation level, for Chu Feng was unable to perceive her cultivation.</span><br><span>In front of the lady was a monument emanating the aura of the Ancient Era. The monument was an entrance, but it was sealed off by a formation. There were also words inscribed on it.</span><br><span>The lady was examining the monument, possibly deciding whether she should breach the formation and enter.</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>The woman&rsquo;s white dress suddenly fluttered as her spirit power surged.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Gray Dragon God-cloak?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng was surprised.</span><br><span>The lady was clearly a junior, yet she had reached such a high level of accomplishment as a world spiritist. On top of that, her precise control of spirit power surpassed even Bai Yunqing. This showed just how talented she was.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Could she be the &lsquo;girl&rsquo; that young man was talking about?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>The young man had previously asked Chu Feng whether he was &lsquo;that girl&rsquo;s companion&rsquo; and even expressed his hostility.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Let&rsquo;s show ourselves first.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng had previously concealed himself to be safe, but the lady didn&rsquo;t look to be an evil person. Furthermore, it was likely that he had to pass through the entrance too. With these considerations in mind, he decided to show himself.</span><br><span>That lady finally noticed Chu Feng and warily turned to look at him. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Rest assured, young miss. I bear no ill will,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the lady asked once more.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here because I have some business to attend to. May I know why you are here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s any of your business,&rdquo; the lady replied.</span><br><span>Seeing how guarded the other party was toward him, Chu Feng chuckled before descending to the ground. He slowly walked toward the monument while saying, &ldquo;It looks like you&rsquo;re struggling over there. Why don&rsquo;t I help you?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;You? Can&rsquo;t you tell how powerful my formation is? There&rsquo;s no way you&rsquo;ll be of any help when I can&rsquo;t even&hellip; Ah&hellip;&rdquo; The lady&rsquo;s words trailed off when she realized that Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power had reached Blue Dragon God-cloak, a level higher than hers. She immediately changed her tune and said, &ldquo;All right, go ahead.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng first scanned the monument with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eye before beginning to construct a formation.</span><br><span>The key to deciphering this stone monument&rsquo;s formation wasn&rsquo;t one&rsquo;s spirit power but one&rsquo;s world spiritist techniques. To Chu Feng, who had inherited Lord Qin Jiu&rsquo;s legacy, this formation didn&rsquo;t pose a problem at all.</span><br><span>The lady&rsquo;s eyes slowly lit up as she watched Chu Feng construct his formation. Realizing that Chu Feng was more formidable than she had thought, she quietly stood by the side and allowed him to do the work.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>The formation was finally deciphered. The monument slowly sank into the ground, revealing a spirit formation gate.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re incredible. May I know how I should address you?&rdquo; the lady asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I am Chu Feng. How should I address you?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I am Feng Ling.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ah, so it&rsquo;s Miss Feng Ling. Are you willing to tell me why you are here now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>Feng Ling finally opened up to Chu Feng and told her why she was here. It turned out that she had a good friend who noticed a high concentration of natural energies in this region while passing by and decided to investigate it. Unfortunately, the good friend fell sick afterward, and the symptoms were the same as Li Wu&rsquo;s.</span><br><span>Feng Ling tried many remedies to cure her good friend, but they were to no avail. In the </span><span>end, she decided to explore this place herself to see if she could find a cure.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Miss Feng Ling sure is a loyal friend. It really is a huge coincidence. I happen to be here for the same reason too.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng proceeded to tell Feng Ling the reason he was here, but he left out the details about the Black-feathered Specter.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It looks like we have the same goals. That sure is a coincidence.&rdquo; Feng Ling&rsquo;s attitude further softened after learning that Chu Feng&rsquo;s goal was the same as hers.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Speaking of which, Miss Feng Ling, do you know this person?&rdquo; Chu Feng quickly drew out the young man he had met earlier with his finger.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who is that? I don&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo; Feng Ling shook her head. &ldquo;Is he your friend?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s another person I met in this remnant earlier. He asked me if I was &lsquo;that girl&rsquo;s companion&rsquo;, and you&rsquo;re the only other person I have met here, so I wondered if you were the person he was referring to,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recognize him,&rdquo; Feng Ling said before turning her attention to the spirit formation gate. &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, shall we enter?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span><br><span>In spite of his amicable attitude, he sent a voice transmission to Eggy, saying, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong with her.&rdquo;</span><br></p></div>
