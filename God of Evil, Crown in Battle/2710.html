        <div> - Not Only Looting<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Xianshuo will only enter the hunting grounds on the tenth day,&rdquo; that little pretty boy added.<br>Chu Feng lifted the pretty boy up. He stared into his eyes and asked, &ldquo;Are you telling the truth?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course. I am not lying to you. If you don&rsquo;t trust me, you can ask them,&rdquo; the little pretty boy spoke in a very determined manner.<br>However, his eyes flickered unceasingly as he said those words. Even his mouth was shuddering. It could be seen that he was also very scared of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Very well, I will wait until the tenth day,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng retrieved his oppressive spirit power from the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>Seeing that they had regained their freedom, the little pretty boy asked with trembling fear, &ldquo;We&hellip; can we go now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, you all can go. However, before leaving, you must hand over all of your World Spirit Bones,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; That little pretty face was somewhat unwilling to do so upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;In that case, it is better that I do it myself.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng waved his sleeve. Then, the Cosmos Sacks on the waists of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations all fell before Chu Feng.<br>Then, Chu Feng personally removed the World Spirit Bones from their Cosmos Sacks.<br>Merely, Chu Feng was quite surprised by the amount. These were all the younger generation of the Chu Heavenly Clan. Not only had they personally hunted World Spirit Bones, but they had also robbed more from others.<br>However, when he added all of them up, these people only possessed a bit over ten thousand World Spirit Bones. They were far inferior to what Chu Feng had harvested.<br>This caused Chu Feng to feel rather disappointed.<br>&ldquo;You all are truly useless.&rdquo;<br>After retrieving the World Spirit Bones from their Cosmos Sacks, Chu Feng returned the Cosmos Sacks to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>Chu Feng had only taken the World Spirit Bones. He did not touch any of their other treasures.<br>However, even with that, Chu Feng still gained the resentment of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; this is robbery,&rdquo; the little pretty boy said to Chu Feng with a denouncing tone.<br>It was as if he were a grand righteous individual standing at the apex of morality, and was qualified to criticize Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng completely ignored the criticism from someone like him. He smiled lightly and said, &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. I am robbing you all. What can you do about it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were completely speechless. It was true, there was nothing that they could do to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I might as well tell you all this. Today, I, Chu Feng, am not only going to rob you all, but I will also make you become bottom tier existences in this hunt,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Bottom tier existences?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; what do you mean by that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; didn&rsquo;t you say that you would spare us once we handed our World Spirit Bones over to you?&rdquo; The little pretty boy asked.<br>He actually had a very thorough plan in his heart. As long as Chu Feng let them go, so what if he took those World Spirit Bones?<br>It had only been a single day since the hunt began. There were still nine more days left in the hunt. They would be able to continue robbing others in the nine days that were left.<br>As long as they could regain their freedom, they would be able to continue hunting. Furthermore, once Chu Xianshuo entered the hunting grounds, it would be time for Chu Feng to suffer.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I will let you all go.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, his hands suddenly started to change. He formed a special spirit formation. Then, he raised his arms and the spirit formation turned into several tens of golden lights that landed on those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; what did you do to us?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations started to panic. They felt a sort of binding upon them.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do much. I merely sealed away your spirit power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You all can leave now.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng said with a light chuckle.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; you are truly despicable!!!&rdquo;<br>Those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations all turned green from anger.<br>While it was true that Chu Feng had let them go, he had also sealed away their spirit power.<br>As the hunting grounds was a place where one could not use martial power, if they were unable to use their spirit power too, they would become utter trash.<br>Not to mention continuing to hunt and rob others, even continued survival in the hunting grounds would become an issue.<br>&ldquo;Despicable? Compared to you all, I&rsquo;m far from being despicable,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations all started to shiver from anger. However, they did not know what to do.<br>&ldquo;Are you leaving or not? If you all do not leave now, don&rsquo;t blame me for going back on my word later,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>How could the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations possibly dare to continue to stay here once they hearing those words? One by one, they got up and began to run away.<br>Merely, as they were unable to use their martial power or their spirit power, they were akin to ordinary people without cultivation.<br>Their running speed could be said to be extremely slow.<br>At a glance, they even appeared to be somewhat amusing.<br>Those people were the high and mighty Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s young masters and young ladies.<br>Yet now, they had fallen this low.<br>&ldquo;Are you all still planning to stay here? Do you all not fear that you will be implicated once Chu Xianshuo comes to find me?&rdquo; Chu Feng said to the people behind him.<br>It was only after hearing those words that those people came to a sudden realization. One by one, they hurriedly got up and started fleeing too.<br>The great majority of the people among them had left. However, there was a small group of them that were unwilling to leave.<br>Not only did they not leave, but they instead walked over to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Milord, we were previously robbed by those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations. As for their World Spirit Bones, they are now all with you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you think it is possible for you to return the World Spirit Bones that were ours to us?&rdquo; A person among the group that stayed said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Are you implying that I have robbed your World Spirit Bones?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip; no, merely&hellip;&rdquo; That person still wanted to explain.<br>&ldquo;Since I am not the one who robbed your World Spirit Bones, why the hell are you asking me for World Spirit Bones? Why don&rsquo;t you go and ask the people that robbed your World Spirit Bones for them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For every grievance, someone is responsible. For every debt, there is a debtor. Do you all not understand this?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng stared at the crowd with his sharp gaze. There was a trace of coldness in his eyes.<br>Chu Feng was not someone who bullied the weak and feared the strong. In fact, he was someone with a sense of justice.<br>But while he was someone with a sense of justice, Chu Feng was not a philanthropist either.<br>When those people were robbed by the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, they did not even dare to utter a fart.<br>Yet, they actually came to him to demand their World Spirit Bones back. How could Chu Feng possibly give in to their demands?<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng raised his hand. Then, two hundred World Spirit Bones flew into the sky and landed beside a woman.<br>That woman was the same woman who was robbed by the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations but refused to hand them her World Spirit Bones, and was then kicked flying by the horse-faced Chu Heavenly Clansman.<br>&ldquo;Among you all, only she is qualified to obtain World Spirit Bones from me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the rest of you, scram immediately,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to the crowd.<br>At that moment, those people requesting World Spirit Bones immediately turned red. They were feeling ashamed.<br>One by one, they turned around and left. None of them dared to continue to tangle with Chu Feng.<br>After all, Chu Feng was someone who dared to beat up even people from the Chu Heavenly Clan. They naturally would not dare to offend him.<br>Actually, the only reason why they decided to ask for World Spirit Bones from Chu Feng was because they thought Chu Feng to be a kindhearted person and wanted to take advantage of him.<br>However, they came to realize that Chu Feng was not someone to be provoked. Thus, they naturally did not dare to continue to tangle with him.<br>&ldquo;Thank you. However, I am able to hunt World Spirit Beasts myself in order to obtain World Spirit Bones. There is no reason for me to accept your World Spirit Bones.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, that woman walked over to Chu Feng and handed the World Spirit Bones back to him.<br>&ldquo;I am not taking pity on you. I am doing this purely out of admiration toward your courage,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I also admire your courage. Farewell.&rdquo;<br>The woman smiled lightly. However, she still placed the World Spirit Bones before Chu Feng. Then, she turned around and left.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng stopped trying to force her to accept the World Spirit Bones.<br>However, he was unable to contain himself from saying, &ldquo;There are so many men here. Yet, their moral backbones are inferior to that of a woman. This is truly pitiful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rumble, rumble, rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the land suddenly started to tremble violently.<br>At the same time, red gaseous substances began to seep out from below the ground. They were gathering at a place near Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng immediately stood up upon seeing the red gaseous substances that were gathering continuously.<br>He was able to sense that an enormous power was currently being condensed.<br><br><br></p></div>
