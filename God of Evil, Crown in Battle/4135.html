        <div> - Two Series Of Abnormal Signs<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>With thunder that shook both heaven and earth, the nine-colored lightning struck the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>The Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation was completely filled by the nine-colored lightning.<br>Just imagine what it would be like for the nine-colored lightning that covered an entire Upper Realm to enter a narrow Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>Apart from the nine-colored lightning, nothing else could be seen.<br>Chu Feng and Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s silhouettes were completely drowned out by the lightning.<br>The spirit formation surrounding the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation began to twist and distort frantically. The surrounding ground also trembled violently.<br>The nine-colored divine lightning was letting out ear-piercing roars nonstop.<br>It was as if the nine devastating lightning beasts were trapped in a cage, and trying to break it apart.<br>Seeing that the nine-colored divine lightning was so powerful, the excited expressions on the faces of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were replaced with shock and fear.<br>They were nervous.<br>They were afraid.<br>Their bodies were shivering.<br>Even though they were all Heavenly Bloodline possessors, even though they&rsquo;d dealt with the nine-colored divine lightning all their lives, they were still afraid.<br>They were afraid that the nine-colored divine lightning would escape from the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation and obliterate all of them.<br>As they were Heavenly Bloodline possessors, they were able to feel with even greater certainty how powerful the nine-colored divine lightning was.<br>They were experiencing a sense of oppression from the depths of their bloodlines.<br>&ldquo;Would someone really be able to face such a Divine Affliction?&rdquo;<br>The people from the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan began to worry for their young master Tiancheng again.<br>The nine-colored divine lightning was simply too powerful. It had engulfed the entire Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation and made it impossible for them to see anything.<br>As the lightning was simply too powerful, they had no ability that could allow them to see through the lightning and find their young master.<br>As such, they had no idea what sort of situation Zuoqiu Tiancheng was in, and whether or not he was still alive.<br>Nevertheless, they were worried after witnessing how terrifying the nine-colored divine lightning was.<br>Witnessing such powerful nine-colored divine lightning, even the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, who had enormous confidence in Zuoqiu Tiancheng, began to panic.<br>Seeing the nine-colored divine lightning wreaking havoc inside the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation, he began to feel worried too.<br>Would his son be able to withstand such powerful nine-colored divine lightning?<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, more thunder exploded from above.<br>Looking up, more omnipresent nine-colored divine lightning had appeared in the sky.<br>Even though the nine-colored divine lightning appeared much weaker than the earlier one, it was still surging violently.<br>It was most definitely not a lightning tribulation that ordinary people could trigger.<br>Seeing that, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief became ecstatic.<br>&ldquo;A breakthrough! A breakthrough!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My son Tiancheng managed to withstand the legendary Divine Lightning Affliction!&rdquo;<br>He was so excited that he shouted out loud.<br>Hearing that, the other Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen also began to cheer loudly.<br>They realized what had happened.<br>The abnormal sign that had appeared in the sky was no longer the Divine Lightning Affliction.<br>That was also the reason why the lightning in the sky was not as fierce as the lightning that had appeared before.<br>For an abnormal sign composed of lightning to appear after the Divine Lightning Affliction had landed, what could it possibly signify?<br>It meant that Zuoqiu Tiancheng had managed to withstand the Divine Lightning Affliction.<br>Not only that, but he had also managed to make another breakthrough, and trigger another abnormal sign composed of lightning after withstanding the Divine Lightning Affliction.<br>If Zuoqiu Tiancheng was able to withstand the lightning strike then he would gain two successive breakthroughs in cultivation, and reach rank four Utmost Exalted from rank two Utmost Exalted in one stroke.<br>With that, Zuoqiu Tiancheng would become the strongest younger generation of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan.<br>Whilst Zuoqiu Daoyi was very powerful, he was only a rank three Utmost Exalted.<br>It was evident that he would be surpassed by Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>Zuoqiu Tiancheng would be able to fully represent his title as the strongest genius.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Under the gazes of countless eyes, the new lightning tribulation in the sky struck the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>Even though the original nine-colored divine lightning was still engulfing the entire Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were no longer worried like before. Instead, they became endlessly excited, and were shouting and cheering nonstop.<br>They believed that since Zuoqiu Tiancheng had been able to withstand such a terrifying Divine Lightning Affliction, the current Divine Tribulation would definitely not be an issue to him.<br>What they didn&rsquo;t know was that their Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were not the only people watching the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation attentively.<br>Standing above some clouds were two people, one old and one young.<br>The old man had a head of white hair and a pair of sharp, hawk-like eyes.<br>Not only did he possess a robust build, but he was also over five meters tall.<br>As for the other person, she was a relatively petite girl.<br>The girl had a head of long black hair tied into two ponytails that gave off a slightly mischievous look. However, her large black eyes looked very mature, a complete contrast to her appearance.<br>The girl was currently sitting cross-legged atop the clouds like a mischievous child.<br>As for the old man, he stood behind the girl like a guardian protecting her.<br>Both the old man and the girl were wearing golden gowns that flickered with golden light.<br>Upon closer inspection, one would notice scale-like objects covering them. Those scales were treasures. As light shone on them, they glittered with dazzling brilliance.<br>That said, the gowns were not the most important part.<br>Most importantly, both the twin-tailed mischievous-looking girl and that tall and robust white-haired old man wore title plates on their waists.<br>On the title plates were the words &lsquo;Dragon Clan.&rsquo;<br>This meant that the two of them belonged to the Dragon Clan.<br>Their title plates were much more exquisite than the one Long Daozhi possessed.<br>This pair of old and young were very close to the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>Yet, no one from the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan had noticed them.<br>Not even the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had noticed them.<br>&ldquo;What dazzling lightning.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time that I&rsquo;ve seen such an abnormal lightning sign.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Grandpa Bu, is this really the legendary Divine Lightning Affliction?&rdquo; asked the girl.<br>&ldquo;This old man has never witnessed such a sight either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I think it is most likely the legendary Divine Lightning Affliction.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who would&rsquo;ve expected such a genius to actually appear in the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only did he train in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, but he also withstood the legendary Divine Lightning Affliction.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With the birth of such a genius, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan will, sooner or later, obtain their place amongst the Upper Starfields.&rdquo; Unconcealed admiration was present in the old man&rsquo;s tone.<br>&ldquo;Grandpa Bu, didn&rsquo;t I say that such an abnormal sign was extraordinary? Fortunately I noticed it and decided to come check it out. Else, we&rsquo;d have missed out on a good show.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should be thanking me,&rdquo; the girl raised her head and spoke proudly.<br>&ldquo;You little girl. You&rsquo;re just fond of joining in on the fun. That said, your decision to check things out today was well worth the trouble,&rdquo; the old man said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Look, look! The lightning is disappearing.&rdquo; Suddenly, the girl pointed to the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation below.<br>Hearing those words, the old man also turned his gaze back to the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>The sight of the lightning disappearing had also been caught by the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>At that moment, the cheering sounds disappeared from the surroundings.<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen all shut their mouths, and were even holding their breath.<br>They were all extremely nervous...<br></p></div>
