        <h1>Chapter 5607: Your Protective Formation Doesn’t Work</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng could no longer rein in his anger upon seeing the token. Tremendous killing intent poured out from him and shook the surroundings. It was so strong that the old man was startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was much stronger and more terrifying than the young man&rsquo;s killing intent. It seeped right into the bones and intimidated the soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Immortal Slaughter was the infamous assassination organization that had worked with the Pill Dao Immortal Sect to exterminate the Golden Dragon Flame Sect, the sect his grandmother belonged to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandmother was sufficiently strong to be able to deal with the Situ World Spiritist Clan back then, but the Pill Dao Immortal Sect and the Immortal Slaughterer secretly made a move and severely injured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng had already dealt with Jia Lingyi, one of the culprits behind that incident, but he hadn&rsquo;t been able to get any further leads on the Immortal Slaughterer. All he knew was that the Immortal Slaughterer currently had seven members, but he couldn&rsquo;t find their whereabouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could have thought that he would encounter someone from the Immortal Slaughterer today?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&hellip; It can&rsquo;t be that you have never heard of the Immortal Slaughterer?&rdquo; The young man was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn&rsquo;t expected Chu Feng to release his killing intent instead of begging for his life after he revealed his identity. What further confused him was how unnerving Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing intent was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I am a member of the Immortal Slaughterer! He should be the one afraid of me, not the other way around!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the young man was trying to figure things out, Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power suddenly flooded out like an erupting volcano, sealing off the surrounding area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Gold Dragon God-cloak?&rdquo; The young man was both surprised and delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t expect a junior like Chu Feng to have reached Gold Dragon God-cloak, but at the same time, he was also relieved since it meant that the latter&rsquo;s fighting prowess was only comparable to a rank five Half-God level cultivator, whereas he could raise his cultivation rank till his strength was comparable to a rank six Half-God level cultivator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How dare you challenge the authority of the Immortal Slaughterer? I&rsquo;ll kill you and your clan!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the young man realized that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t a match for him, he curbed his feeling of unease and tightened his grip around his Exalted Armament dagger. He was going to teach Chu Feng a lesson for daring to challenge him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could make his move, Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation sword had already pierced through his defenses and was making its way toward his dantian. This attack was intended not to take the young man&rsquo;s life but to cripple his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astonished, the young man executed a movement skill and hurriedly retreated while leaving an afterimage in his wake. This was his strongest escape means.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword tore right through his afterimage, but he managed to survive the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before the young man could catch a breather, Chu Feng had already regained his momentum and was rushing toward him with his formation sword once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How is that fellow that strong?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man completely lost his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First and foremost, he was certain that Chu Feng&rsquo;s fighting prowess was at least comparable to a rank six Half-God level cultivator, but he wouldn&rsquo;t have been so afraid if that was all. After all, he had been killing people since he was ten years old. The combat skills he had accrued along the way allowed him to easily subdue anyone in the same cultivation rank as him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was also the reason he caught the eye and became the disciple of the Immortal Slaughterer&rsquo;s Number 2.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not too long ago, his master gave him the Immortal Slaughterer&rsquo;s token and invoked a treasure to summon the Immortal Slaughter&rsquo;s Number 1, who then personally constructed a powerful protective formation in him. That marked his transition into becoming an official member of the Immortal Slaughterer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this point, he had already realized that Chu Feng was no ordinary world spiritist. Even though he utilized spirit power in his attacks, his attacking pattern resembled a cultivator more. Furthermore, his swordsmanship was impressive. It was swift, sharp, and fatal, and it was even able to read where he was going to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, Chu Feng was comparable to him in terms of fighting experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng thrust his sword forth yet again, but this time, the young man was already cornered. Knowing that he had no other choice, a vicious glint flashed across the young man&rsquo;s eyes. He tightened his grip around his Exalted Armament dagger with his left hand, but instead of using the dagger to deflect Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack, he tried to grab Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation sword with his bare right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shockingly, he succeeded. He held Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation sword in place with his bare right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perplexed, Chu Feng took a closer look and saw a golden layer cloaking the young man&rsquo;s right hand. The golden layer was a weapon embedded in his palm. In terms of quality, it should be at least comparable to an Exalted Armament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if that was all there was to it, the young man shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to withstand Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a matter of fact, the young man had become significantly stronger than before. He was also emanating a black aura. The chances were that he had a forbidden medicine in his mouth, and it was by eating the forbidden medicine that he gained the strength to stop Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m impressed that you forced me to consume my forbidden medicine, but that&rsquo;s as far as you can go. Lad, you shall die for your ignorance!&rdquo; the young man spat as he firmly held onto Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation sword with his right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In response, Chu Feng swung his arm. There was a dull &lsquo;pu&rsquo;, and the young man&rsquo;s face paled. His right arm, which had been grabbing Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation sword, had been sliced apart, causing blood and flesh to spew everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This isn&rsquo;t possible! I have raised my cultivation, and my hand is embedded with a treasure comparable to an Exalted Armament. How can a formation sword that fellow conjured at a whim slice my arm apart just like that?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This could only mean that Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength was far above his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the young man was trying to process what was going on, the formation sword had already fallen on his dantian, but it failed to pierce it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sinister smile emerged on the young man&rsquo;s face. He wasn't intimidated at all even though he was in a disadvantageous position, for he knew that he still had an ace to fall back on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Powerful spirit power surged out of the young man&rsquo;s dantian and enveloped his body. This was the protective formation the Immortal Slaughterer&rsquo;s Number 1 had constructed in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the peak of the protective formation were two voids. From one of the voids, Chu Feng sensed a gaze on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng knew that the young man wasn&rsquo;t a true member of the Immortal Slaughterer yet; he was just a disciple of one of their members. However, the gaze coming from the void was likely to be a true member of the Immortal Slaughterer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you?&rdquo; an elderly voice echoed from the protective formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You know me?&rdquo; Chu Feng instantaneously spotted what was wrong with that response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the old man ignored Chu Feng and instead posed a question to the young man, &ldquo;Mie&rsquo;er, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master, I don&rsquo;t know him, but he tried to steal my treasure. I was forced to reveal my identity as a member of the Immortal Slaughterer, but that only further emboldened him to make a move on me. There&rsquo;s something weird about him. I&rsquo;m unable to rival him even after consuming the forbidden medicine. Master, please redress my grievances!&rdquo; the young man said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that the two of you met by coincidence? Where are you?&rdquo; the old man asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master, I am in the Fighting Starfield&rsquo;s Immortal Stream Upper Realm. The Nine Realms Immortal Region of the legends has just opened, and I&rsquo;m currently in it,&rdquo; the young man said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man was momentarily silent before he turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Young friend, my disciple is young and immature. Please show mercy and spare him.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why are you pretending as if you don&rsquo;t know me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend, what do you mean by that?&rdquo; the old man asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Your words clearly show that you know who I am. Your Immortal Slaughterer should </span><span>have already heard about my confrontation with the Situ World Spiritist Clan and Jia Lingyi, right? Aren&rsquo;t you looking for an opportunity to eliminate me too?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man was silent for a while before chuckling. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a smart one, Chu Feng. You caught on to me just because I misspoke once. You are similar to your grandmother in that regard.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master, who is he?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It finally dawned on the young man that there was a grudge between Chu Feng and his master. It was no wonder Chu Feng suddenly directed his killing intent toward him after he revealed his identity as a member of the Immortal Slaughterer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man ignored the young man and instead addressed Chu Feng, saying, &ldquo;Yes, our Immortal Slaughterer is indeed looking for you, so I suggest you escape as soon as possible. Otherwise, we&rsquo;ll have our hands on you very soon. You can be certain that you&rsquo;ll suffer a fate worse than death once you fall into our hands.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered. &ldquo;You are the ones who will die, and it&rsquo;ll start from this disciple of yours.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo; The old man laughed even more arrogantly. &ldquo;To think that you&rsquo;re a world spiritist, Chu Feng! Can&rsquo;t you tell that my disciple&rsquo;s protective formation is beyond your means to deal with?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tightened his grip around his formation sword, causing it to emanate a peculiar light. Moments later, the sword began to release an unnerving suction force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You?!?!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the young man and the old man lost their composure, for they could sense Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation sword absorbing the protective formation.</span></p></div>
