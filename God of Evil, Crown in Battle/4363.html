        <div>: The Emergence of a Treasure<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Milord, since you&rsquo;re a friend of Junior Yin, we actually aren&rsquo;t enemies with one another either. I know that we had our grudges in the past, but these will be resolved as a matter of time. I ask of you not to make things difficult for us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, if Senior Lian had offended you in the past, allow us to apologize to you on his behalf. We&rsquo;ll kneel down to you, so please pardon him this once.&rdquo;<br>Even though the other two were still clearly very afraid of Chu Feng, they still bucked up their courage and spoke on behalf of their senior to Chu Feng, hoping to resolve this matter amicably.<br>Furthermore, from the attitude they were putting on, it seemed like they were really intending to kneel to Chu Feng if it could resolve this problem.<br>However, Chu Feng flung his sleeves backward and said, &ldquo;Forget it!&rdquo;<br>Those two men were about to kneel, but before their knees could strike the floor, Chu Feng had already pulled them back up.<br>&ldquo;I was just curious about it, that&rsquo;s all there is. However, I advise you not to act so domineeringly in the future anymore, especially you, Lian Xi. Oppressing the weak to boost your own ego is not something to be proud of, it only shows how insecure you are as a person.&rdquo;<br>After saying his piece, Chu Feng turned around and left the area.<br>He chose to believe them this time around, that Yin Zhuanghong was doing fine in the Cloudsky Immortal Sect.<br>Of course, he would also head to the Cloudsky Immortal Sect to check if they were truly honest with him, and if they had lied about anything, not only would the three of them have to face Chu Feng&rsquo;s vengeance, even the Cloudsky Immortal Sect wouldn&rsquo;t get away scot-free either.<br>&ldquo;Senior Lian, he&rsquo;s really leaving like that?&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng left, the two companions asked quietly with anxious looks on their faces.<br>&ldquo;How am I to know?&rdquo;<br>Lian Xi&rsquo;s tone wasn&rsquo;t too good. He had been outdone by Chu Feng earlier, and it put him in a really bad mood.<br>&ldquo;Senior Chu, a true man knows how to tolerate humiliation. Even though that fellow is an exceptional world spiritist, in terms of his standing and backing, he doesn&rsquo;t come close to competing with our Cloudsky Immortal Sect. If you really harbor anger toward him, we can always drop by the Red-dress Holy Land in the future to vent your fury on them,&rdquo; the two companions told Lian Xi through voice transmission.<br>They had no choice to be discreet as they couldn&rsquo;t tell for sure whether Chu Feng had really left the area or not.<br>If Chu Feng was still hiding around the place to listen in to them, what they had just said could very well cost them their lives.<br>&ldquo;What kind of nonsense are you spouting? Don&rsquo;t you know that the Red-dress Holy Land has treated Junior Yin generously? We would be intentionally putting Junior Yin on the spot if we were to mess with the Red-dress Holy Land!<br>&ldquo;Besides, even though I, Lian Xi, am not a good person, I also know not to implicate innocent bystanders in my own grudge. Today, it&rsquo;s the fellow named Asura who came to mess with us, so even if I want to exact vengeance, I&rsquo;d exact vengeance on him. Why would I vent my fury on the female disciples of the Red-dress Holy Land instead?<br>&ldquo;That being said, that woman named Zhao Hong did humiliate me that day. One of these days, after I raise my cultivation, I&rsquo;ll challenge her once more and make sure to defeat her with my own hands. The same goes for the incident today too!&rdquo; Lian Xi spoke with a haughty tone.<br>Despite how imposing his words sounded, the impact was significantly lessened by the fact that he had spoken these words through voice transmission. Even he dared not to speak these words aloud.<br>He was also afraid that Chu Feng was hidden in the surroundings.<br>Hearing Lian Xi&rsquo;s response, those two men glanced at one another and chuckled quietly to themselves.<br>In truth, they didn&rsquo;t intend to harm the Red-dress Holy Land with their words either. It was just that they understood what kind of person Lian Xi was, and they knew that he would be in a bad mood after all that had happened. So, they said that they did earlier so as to give him an opportunity to vent his emotions.<br>&ldquo;Senior Lian, do we still continue?&rdquo; the two companions asked as they glanced at the object before them.<br>Lian Xi hesitated a little at this moment, but soon, he made up his mind and said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s gamble this once that Junior Yin&rsquo;s friend has no intention of making the Cloudsky Immortal Sect his enemies!&rdquo;<br>The other two companions immediately understood Lian Xi&rsquo;s words.<br>They were going to continue with their initial plan. They were going to trust that Chu Feng meant what he said and wouldn&rsquo;t sabotage them.<br>As for Chu Feng, he earnestly had no intention of sabotaging them either. He could have used his means to force them to spit out everything they knew about the object and steal the treasure they were trying to open.<br>However, since he had already said that he wouldn&rsquo;t interfere in their business, he unhesitatingly left the area and continued to pursue the black streak.<br>But shortly after Chu Feng left, his footsteps screeched to a halt once more.<br>The Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk inside his Cosmos Sack was suddenly reacting intensely once more.<br>After all that had happened thus far, Chu Feng had a high regard for the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk. He knew that its capabilities were the real deal, and that it was no ordinary treasure.<br>And astonishingly, the reaction of the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk this time around was actually even greater than that when it was faced with the black streak earlier.<br>Astonished, Chu Feng quickly halted his footsteps and took out the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk. Holding it tightly in his hand, he began to activate it.<br>Soon, he understood the reason behind the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk intense reaction.<br>In the last few times, the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk would manifest its powers in the form of blood-red smoke and show him the way through that.<br>But there was a slight difference this time around. As soon as Chu Feng activated it, it immediately sent a piece of information straight into his mind through the blood-colored gaseous flames.<br>A formidable treasure was going to emerge on these lands, south to where he was.<br>After delivering this information into Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind, the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk finally calmed down once more.<br>If not for the fact Lian Xi and the others were east of where Chu Feng was whereas the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk indicated the south, Chu Feng would have thought that the emerging treasure had something to do with what Lian Xi and the others were working on.<br>This meant that the treasure the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk was informing him of was different from the one which Lian Xi and his two companions were trying to open.<br>Typically speaking, Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t have delayed the hunt for the black streak over anything since there was no treasure that was more valuable than the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s life.<br>However, if the sentient Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk was giving him such an explicit hint, there was a good chance that there was more to this matter than he thought of.<br>Chu Feng glanced at his compass, which was still not reacting properly yet, and figured that it was unlikely for him to find the black streak anytime soon, so he decided to take a short detour to find out what was going on.<br>It would just be a momentary stop. He wasn&rsquo;t planning on wasting too much time on this matter.<br>During this duration, he would keep a close eye on the compass, and as soon as there was any reaction from the compass, he would immediately change his target to the black streak even if the treasure was already right before his eyes.<br>Weng!<br>All of a sudden, a glaring brilliance suddenly broke out in the distant sky. It was so bright that it felt like another sun had arisen in the world.<br>This light had come from where Lian Xi and his two companions were at.<br>This indicated that they had successfully opened the object that they were working on.<br>&ldquo;Looks like they have succeeded. Speaking of that, I didn&rsquo;t think that they would be so daring as to continue working on the treasure right after I left. Aren&rsquo;t they worried that I might renege on my words?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng should have headed south, but out of overwhelming curiosity and the proximity in distance, he still ended up turning around to head to where Lian Xi and the others were at.<br>He wanted to know just what kind of treasure had they managed to obtain.<br>Through his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, he was able to see everything clearly without having to come close to them.<br>Indeed, Lian Xi and the others had managed to open the treasure, causing it to surface it in the air. It was just that this treasure was a little peculiar.<br>Through its brilliant glow, it was apparent that it was no ordinary item, but despite so, Chu Feng was unable to tell what the treasure was intended to be used for. All he could tell that it was incomplete at the moment.<br>He could sense that there was a unique surge of energy rising from the depths of the ground to fuse together with that incomplete treasure.<br>It was upon sensing the unique surge of energy that Chu Feng finally understood why Lian Xi and the others had to open the treasure here. Most likely, this land fulfilled some sort of condition that was necessary for the opening of the treasure.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess was that the treasure was an incomplete map. Only when it was completed would one be finally able to peer through its secrets.<br>&ldquo;This aura&hellip;&rdquo;<br>After learning what the object was, Chu Feng was just about to leave the area when he suddenly felt a powerful aura coming from the south.<br>Soon enough, five silhouettes came into appearance.<br>Chu Feng was a little surprised to see those five of them.<br>It seemed like enemies were always bound to bump into one another.<br>Those five figures were from the Soaring Flower Gazebo.<br></p></div>
