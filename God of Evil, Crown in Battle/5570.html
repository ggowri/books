        <h1>Chapter 5570: Jie Tian’s Trump Card</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Jie Tian was no pushover either. He was surprised by the formation, but he wasn&rsquo;t flustered at all. As soon as he saw the formation, he began channeling his spirit power. He raised both his hands and pushed them forward.</span><br><span>His spirit power interweaved to form a swiftly expanding barrier against the rain of starlight arrows.</span><br><span>The barrier succeeded in blocking a few starlight arrows at the start, but the starlight arrows were so powerful that it didn&rsquo;t take long for cracks to appear in the barrier.</span><br><span>In just a few moments, the barrier shattered into fragments.</span><br><span>Even so, Jie Tian didn&rsquo;t lose his cool. He hadn&rsquo;t expected his barrier to be strong enough to ward off the starlight arrows. Rather, he was buying time to manifest two spears that spanned a length of over a hundred meters.</span><br><span>It would be a grave mistake to think of these two spears as ordinary formation spears. These were his true means to deal with the starlight arrows. Even so, there were so many arrows that the odds were still stacked against Jie Tian&rsquo;s favor.</span><br><span>Little Fishy stared at the starlight arrows raining down on Jie Tian in astonishment.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is this big brother&rsquo;s means? It&rsquo;s no wonder why even my big brother acknowledges </span><span>him.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Little Fishy didn&rsquo;t bother making a move because she knew that she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to come up with a stronger attack than Chu Feng&rsquo;s starlight arrows even if she expended the final sliver of the energy she received from the starlight formation.</span><br><span>At this point, whether they won the battle or not depended solely on how powerful Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation was. It looked like the tables were finally turning, as the arrows began to come closer and closer to Jie Tian.</span><br><span>This was Chu Feng&rsquo;s aim.</span><br><span>Little Fishy glanced at Chu Feng with sympathetic eyes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How much suffering did big brother go through in order to come this far?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>Little Fishy had also been through her fair share of suffering in order to reach her current level. Talent was important, but it would only be squandered if one didn&rsquo;t work hard.</span><br><span>However, she was in a privileged position, in the sense that even though she had to work hard on her cultivation, she was still sheltered by her family. She had access to invaluable cultivation resources, and there were elders looking out for her.</span><br><span>In contrast, Chu Feng had to slowly climb his way to his current height.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>Another two roaring explosions echoed. Little Fishy turned her attention back to Jie Tian.</span><br><span>The collision between the starlight arrows and Jie Tian&rsquo;s spears produced shockwaves reminiscent of fireworks. They looked beautiful even though they were incredibly dangerous.</span><br><span>From Jie Tian&rsquo;s point of view, those shockwaves weren&rsquo;t good news. There were so many starlight arrows that they continued pressing closer despite Jie Tian&rsquo;s best attempts to ward them off with his formation spears.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Jie Tian, are you able to deal with it?&rdquo; the emaciated elder&rsquo;s voice echoed from Jie Tian&rsquo;s left shoulder.</span><br><span>As Chu Feng had expected, the traitors were hiding in Jie Tian&rsquo;s body, and they had indeed constructed a power-sharing formation to augment Jie Tian&rsquo;s fighting prowess. However, the traitors were starting to lose their nerves as the starlight arrows pressed closer.</span><br><span>They would be goners if Jie Tian lost the fight.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Jie Tian sneered, not bothering to answer the question.</span><br><span>While Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> starlight arrows were steadily getting closer, there weren&rsquo;t many of them left. He was confident of fending against them to the very end.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>&ldquo;Something is off!&rdquo;</span><br><span>All of a sudden, right as Jie Tian crushed yet another arrow, a flood of spirit power suddenly gushed out of the destroyed arrow and rushed at him. It was so fast that he didn&rsquo;t have time to react at all.</span><br><span>Surprisingly, this surge of spirit power didn&rsquo;t hurt him, but he sensed something was </span><span>amiss.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This feeling&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Tian was taken aback for a moment before loneliness, anger, pain, and all kinds of complex emotions flashed across his eyes. He had successfully fended against all of the starlight arrows, but he was in no mood to celebrate his success at all.</span><br><span>He knew what had just happened&mdash;he had suffered a huge loss in this clash!</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Jie Tian, that treasure has been sealed off!&rdquo; the emaciated elder exclaimed.</span><br><span>The energy augmenting Jie Tian&rsquo;s fighting prowess had vanished, but Jie Tian wasn&rsquo;t surprised. He had figured out the intent behind the abrupt flood of spirit power shortly after it enveloped his body.</span><br><span>It was a two-layered formation. The rain of starlight arrows was just a diversion. The sealing formation was the true goal.</span><br><span>He had been tricked!</span><br><span>He turned to Little Fishy and spat through gritted teeth, &ldquo;I have underestimated you.&rdquo;</span><br><span>He felt ashamed to have been tricked by someone who knew nothing about formations at all.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t me,&rdquo; Little Fishy said as she glanced at Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Him? Impossible,&rdquo; Jie Tian refuted Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> insinuation.</span><br><span>The earlier formation was powered by Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> starlight formation. Besides, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t have the means to pull off a formation of such caliber.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you believe me or not. I&rsquo;m only telling you that so that you can die a knowing death,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span><br><span>Jie Tian didn&rsquo;t have the power-sharing formation to augment his fighting prowess anymore, and his formation armor was significantly depleted. In contrast, while Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> starlight formation was also running dry, there was no doubt she was currently stronger than Jie Tian.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Wait a moment!&rdquo; Jie Tian raised his hand to stop Little Fishy. &ldquo;</span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>, there&rsquo;s something I need to tell you. I have already won this war from the very start. You&rsquo;re only struggling in futility right now.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Little Fishy sneered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon find out why if you obstinately choose to continue fighting with me, but know that I won&rsquo;t be showing you any mercy then. Besides, there&rsquo;s no need for us to fight at all. We didn&rsquo;t come here to save the world; we&rsquo;re here for the fortuitous encounter. The fortuitous encounter is right before our eyes. Why don&rsquo;t we join hands and work together?&rdquo; Jie Tian asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&hellip; aren&rsquo;t worthy of joining hands with me,&rdquo; Little Fishy replied.</span><br><span>Without any hesitation, she manifested her powerful starlight formation into a gigantic tsunami that crashed down on Jie Tian. This was an extremely powerful attack, for she had devoted the final slivers of the starlight formation&rsquo;s energy to it.</span><br><span>Jie Tian frowned. He knew it would be hard for him to take this attack with his current strength, so he gritted his teeth and came to a decision.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t the only one with a trump card!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Tian waved his arm, and a fist-sized black sphere flew out from his sleeves. A peculiar light glimmered on its surface, and the sphere suddenly released a powerful </span><span>suction force.</span><br><span>The suction force was so great that Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> all-out attack was instantaneously swallowed whole by the black sphere.</span><br></p></div>
