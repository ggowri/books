        <h1>Chapter 3408</h1>
        <div> - Situation Turning Bad<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, inside the grand formation and beneath the mountains, a tornado swirled up.<br>A spirit formation gate emerged in the center of the tornado.<br>Seeing that spirit formation gate, the people of the younger generation inside the grand formation became exceptionally excited.<br>Even though they could not see the situation within the spirit formation gate, the spirit formation gate was emitting a special sort of power.<br>It was spirit power!!!<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, thank you for your trouble.&rdquo;<br>After successfully opening the spirit formation gate, Linghu Hongfei clasped his fist at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Linghu, don&rsquo;t mention it. Since they&rsquo;re determined to court death, I feel that&hellip; I should satisfy their wish,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng seems to know some things. However, I feel that there is always danger in anything beneficial to one&rsquo;s growth. The path of marital cultivation is one that goes against the heavens. A place with dangers is also a place with opportunities,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei said.<br>&ldquo;That is also what I believe. However, this time around, it is truly extremely dangerous,&rdquo; after Chu Feng finished saying those words, he looked to the Liangqiu Sisters and Wuming Shengjie, &ldquo;Are you all really planning to enter it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I want to give it a try,&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, this is a rare opportunity. Likely, we will not be able to encounter such an opportunity in the future. Thus, we sisters do not wish to miss out on it,&rdquo; Liangqiu Lanyue spoke with a serious expression. Liangqiu Hongyue also nodded.<br>Upon seeing Liangqiu Lanyue like that, Chu Feng realized how determined they were.<br>Liangqiu Lanyue was a person of few words. Yet, she had decided to declare her position. She was determined to enter.<br>&ldquo;After entering, the three of you are to follow me. Remember, you must maintain a distance of three meters or less from me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; the Liangqiu Sisters agreed without any hesitation.<br>Even though Wuma Shengjie did not say anything, one could tell that she had also agreed to it from her gaze.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, I have a presumptuous request,&rdquo; right at that moment, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er walked over to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Could I also follow behind young master Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;Everyone could also follow me. I will protect everyone,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei said.<br>After Linghu Hongfei said those words, the remaining younger generations inside the grand formation immediately and uniformly arrived behind Linghu Hongfei.<br>Even the other two younger generations of the Tantai Heavenly Clan arrived behind him.<br>They even gave meaningful looks to Tantai Xing&rsquo;er, and sent her voice transmissions to tell her to follow Linghu Hongfei instead.<br>The way they saw it, even if Chu Feng had grasped some sort of profound mystery regarding the grand formation, they still felt that Linghu Hongfei was much more reliable than him.<br>However, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er completely ignored her fellow clansmen&rsquo;s persuasions. She was determined to make her own decision.<br>&ldquo;Miss Tantai, are you certain you want to follow that guy?&rdquo; At that moment, a voice not from the Tantai Heavenly Clan was heard. It was Linghu Lun.<br>&ldquo;Young master Linghu, it seems that you possess some sort of misunderstanding toward young master Chu Feng. However, I feel that young master Chu Feng is quite reliable. Of course&hellip; I'm not thinking that young master Hongfei is not reliable,&rdquo; Tantai Xing&rsquo;er replied with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, let us not tangle ourselves in trivial things. Upon entering the gate, regardless of who&rsquo;s in trouble, I will, without exception, extend a helping hand. I believe that brother Chu Feng will also do the same,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei said.<br>&ldquo;No, I am only in charge of the people that follow behind me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Linghu Tiemian and the others all felt extremely displeased by Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. Even though they felt that they did not need his protection, and felt that he would not be able to protect them anyways, they still felt extremely displeased by his words.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng is truly a humorous person,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei smiled faintly. Compared to the others from the Linghu Heavenly Clan, he seemed to have a very good impression of Chu Feng.<br>However, to be exact, Linghu Hongfei had a very friendly attitude towards everyone present.<br>As the strongest genius of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Linghu Hongfei did not possess the arrogance or condescending air of other people of the younger generation. Instead, he appeared very cultured and refined, something that was very rare amongst the younger generations.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, can we enter now?&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei asked.<br>&ldquo;Let us enter together,&rdquo; as Chu Feng spoke, his figure shifted, and he leapt into the spirit formation gate.<br>Seeing that, Wuma Shengjie and the others followed Chu Feng inside.<br>After them, Linghu Hongfei also led Linghu Tiemian and the others into the spirit formation gate.<br>At practically the same moment, Grandmaster Liangqiu began to form hand seals single-handedly. Powerful Snake Mark Saint-cloak Spirit Power was released from his body.<br>As the spirit power continued to build up, a mirror emerged.<br>From the mirror, one could see the current situation of Chu Feng and the others.<br>It seemed that they had all entered a land of nothingness. Their surroundings were pitch-black, and nothing could be seen.<br>After Chu Feng and the others landed, they began trying all sorts of methods to release light to illuminate their surroundings.<br>Unfortunately, no matter what sort of method they tried, even with Linghu Hongfei giving it an attempt, they were only able to illuminate a range of several tens of meters.<br>This caused those people of the younger generation to feel uneasy.<br>Not to mention Linghu Hongfei, merely they, with their strength, would be able to easily illuminate a vast region as bright as day.<br>However, within that area they were unable to do so at all. This not only made them feel very powerless, but it also made them feel very uneasy.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a shadow emerged. Then&hellip; the observation formation set up by Grandmaster Liangqiu actually shattered.<br>Seeing that, Grandmaster Liangqiu immediately tried to set up another observation formation. However, this time around, his spirit formation shattered before he could even finish setting it up.<br>It was as if there was some sort of enormous power that was obstructing him.<br>That power was too powerful. Even Grandmaster Liangqiu was powerless to do anything to it.<br>&ldquo;Crap!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Grandmaster Liangqiu was frowning and a trace of panic appeared in his eyes.<br></p></div>
