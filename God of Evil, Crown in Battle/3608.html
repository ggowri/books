        <h1>Chapter 3607</h1>
        <div> - Strange Black Cauldron<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Stand up, stand up, what are you doing?&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly helped Zhang Boyi back up.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, from today on, you are not only my younger sister&rsquo;s benefactor, but you're also my, Zhang Boyi&rsquo;s, benefactor. In the future, even if you are to need me to climb a mountain of blades or descend into a sea of flames, I, Zhang Boyi, will be willing to risk my life to do so at a single command from you.&rdquo;<br>Zhang Boyi wiped the corner of his eyes. He was actually crying.<br>He was also feeling guilty. He was feeling guilty because his sister had encountered fatal danger, but he had been powerless to help her. At the same time, he was feeling joyful. He was rejoicing at Chu Feng acting to save his younger sister&rsquo;s life.<br>It could be seen that the three siblings had an excellent relationship.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it so much. It&rsquo;s merely a trivial matter. I&rsquo;ve already said it, the four of us are one. At the very least, we must work together for now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We cannot do without any one of us. Otherwise&hellip; it will make it more difficult for senior to fuse with the power of the Void Sacred Tree.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We still haven&rsquo;t finished our mission yet. Before that, we cannot allow anyone to fall,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I, Zhang Yanfeng, am able to tell that you are a true man.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will not bother with superfluous words. However, brother Chu Feng, we three siblings will firmly remember the kindness you&rsquo;ve shown us today,&rdquo; Zhang Yanfeng said with a clasped fist.<br>&ldquo;I h-ha-have a suggestion. W-why don&rsquo;t y-you have y-your little s-sister devote her l-life to my b-brother?&rdquo; Wang Qiang&rsquo;s laughing voice sounded from above the cliff.<br>His words immediately brought relief to the serious atmosphere in the lake.<br>&ldquo;Four young friends, since you have all successfully managed to attain complete fusion, I will have to trouble you with one final task.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s voice was heard.<br>After saying those words, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted arrived in midair, floating above the valley.<br>Zhang Yanfeng and his two siblings became extremely excited. They made their preparations to imbue the power of the lake to the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s body.<br>However, at this time, Chu Feng suddenly spoke, &ldquo;Senior, what must we do?&rdquo;<br>The reason why he asked that was because he knew very well how powerful the power within the lake was.<br>The four of them had only managed to fuse with the lake, and did not gain control over the power of the lake as their own. With only that, they&rsquo;d nearly died.<br>If they were to truly imbue all of the power of the lake into the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s body, no matter how powerful he might be, he would still not necessarily be able to withstand it.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng felt that if the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was capable of withstanding the lake&rsquo;s power, he wouldn&rsquo;t have sought their help.<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted could very well leap into the lake himself, and directly absorb the power within the lake into his own body. There was simply no need to bother with such a roundabout method.<br>Thus, Chu Feng felt that even if they were to imbue the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted with power, there must be a method to do so, instead of directly imbuing his body with power.<br>Chu Feng felt that directly imbuing the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted with the Void Sacred Tree&rsquo;s power would be very difficult to achieve.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, that question of yours is right on the mark.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why this old man needs the four of you to help me is because the power of the Void Sacred Tree is extremely berserk. Even though you four have managed to fuse with it, and are able to move it to my body, this old man would not be able to withstand the power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, things are different with this here.&rdquo;<br>As the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted spoke, he flicked his finger, and a black object flew out.<br>That object was only the size of a fingernail. However, it soon expanded to a hundred meters wide.<br>That was a cauldron, a black cauldron.<br>The black cauldron did not appear to be precious. In fact, it looked rather crude.<br>The sound of wind could be heard from within the black cauldron.<br>However, if one were to listen carefully, one would notice that those were not sounds of wind at all. Instead, they were roars, the roars of countless beasts.<br>From hearing the sound, one would be able to tell right away that the cauldron was no simple matter.<br>&ldquo;Imbue your power into this black cauldron,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; after receiving those instructions, Chu Feng and the three Zhang siblings immediately started acting.<br>They began to control the power of the Void Sacred Tree within the lake, and started imbuing it into the black cauldron.<br>&ldquo;Clamor~~~&rdquo;<br>Once they began, a stream of water that seemed like a dragon soared into the sky and started making a beeline for the black cauldron.<br>After experiencing the baptism that nearly took their lives earlier, Chu Feng and the Zhang siblings were completely fused with the power within the lake.<br>Thus, they were able to move the power with complete ease.<br>Because of that, they noticed that once the water entered the black cauldron, the black cauldron emitted black gaseous flames. Symbols and runes covered the black gaseous flames. Like a massive army, the black gaseous flames set up a formation outside the black cauldron.<br>At the same time, the black cauldron was using its power to transform the power within the lake.<br>Likely, it was transforming the lake&rsquo;s power into a gentler state.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>However, no good thing lasts forever. As more and more water poured into the black cauldron, the cauldron began to tremble. The trembling became more and more intense. It seemed like it would not be able to sustain the water for much longer.<br>&ldquo;Fix!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted shouted.<br>At the moment when he shouted that command, Chu Feng felt that even his soul trembled.<br>Not only that, but the surrounding natural energies were also affected.<br>The trembling black cauldron also stopped trembling.<br>&ldquo;So powerful,&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart surged with shock.<br>With a simple shout, he was actually able to disrupt the entire world, and suppress the black cauldron. How powerful was that?<br>However, as more and more power and lake water poured into the black cauldron, the cauldron started trembling again. That said, the trembling was easily suppressed by the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>Although both the black cauldron and the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted did not appear to be extremely mighty, they both appeared to be very calm, Chu Feng knew that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was gradually exhausting a great amount of power. To be able to make the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted exhaust this much power, Chu Feng knew that it was not only because the black cauldron was very difficult to contain. Most of all, it was because the power within the lake was simply too strong.<br>No, that was not the lake's power. To be exact, that was the Void Sacred Tree&rsquo;s power.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng finally realized why the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, with how powerful he was, still needed their help.<br>The reason for that was because he needed to be completely focused on suppressing the black cauldron. Apart from him, there was practically no one else capable of doing that.<br>However, at the same time as he was suppressing the black cauldron, he needed people to imbue the black cauldron with the Void Sacred Tree&rsquo;s power. That was the reason why he needed assistance from Chu Feng and the Zhang siblings.<br>Just like that, two hours had passed. Finally, Chu Feng and the Zhang siblings managed to imbue the black cauldron with all the power of the lake.<br>At that moment, there was much less water in the lake than there had been before. However, there were still quite a lot of water.<br>In the end, the lake was still there.<br>Merely, after losing the power of the Void Sacred Tree, the lake was no longer special. The water that remained was the same as ordinary water.<br>Chu Feng and the Zhang siblings also lost their ability to control the Void Sacred Tree&rsquo;s power.<br>The reason for that was because they had imbued all of the Void Sacred Tree&rsquo;s power into the black cauldron.<br></p></div>
