        <div> - The Gaze Of The Abnormal Sign<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Grandmaster,&rdquo; at that moment, many grand characters turned towards Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Actually, the crowd all already had some guesses to what the astonishing sight in the sky was. However, they still hoped that Grandmaster Liangqiu would be able to verify their guess.<br>&ldquo;That is indeed an abnormal sign,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really an abnormal sign? For there to be nine bodies of lightning in the sky, could it be that an expert that possesses a Heavenly Bloodline has made a breakthrough here?&rdquo;<br>After verifying that the scene in the sky was an abnormal sign, the first thing that the crowd thought of was that someone with a Heavenly Bloodline had made a breakthrough here.<br>After all, everyone knew that only Heavenly Bloodlines would give rise to a spectacular abnormal sign with nine lightning dragons in the sky. Most of all, the abnormal sign caused by a Heavenly Bloodline possessor&rsquo;s breakthrough was extremely terrifying.<br>Although a Heavenly Bloodline&rsquo;s abnormal sign was somewhat different from the one present, it greatly resembled it.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible. That&rsquo;s most definitely not an abnormal sign caused by the breakthrough of a Heavenly Bloodline possessor.&rdquo;<br>However, someone immediately refuted that suggestion.<br>Furthermore, it was not only a single person that voiced their refute. Instead, such refutes sounded from all over the vast crowd.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it?&rdquo; someone asked.<br>A middle-aged man from the Tantai Heavenly Clan walked in the air and appeared before the crowd&rsquo;s line of sight. &ldquo;That is indeed not it. Although the breakthrough of Heavenly Bloodline possessors will indeed give rise to Heavenly Lightning, the lightning is nine-colored. As for the lightning before us, it emerged from the deepest region of the skies, so high a place that it was simply untouchable. Furthermore, although the lightning has covered the sky and appears extremely terrifying, it is not nine-colored. Furthermore, it is located so high in the sky that none of us present could possibly reach it.&rdquo; the<br>&ldquo;Although they&rsquo;re both abnormal signs, the abnormal sign caused by the breakthrough of a Heavenly Bloodline possessor is clearly less spectacular than this abnormal sign.&rdquo;<br>The people present firmly believed the middle-aged man&rsquo;s words. The reason for that was because he was no ordinary character.<br>That middle-aged man possessed handsome and soldierly features. He also emitted a very extraordinary air.<br>Even ignoring his strength, the man possessed a look of trustworthiness.<br>This was especially true in terms of his aura. It was much more eye-catching than his handsome features.<br>That said, although he had the appearance of a middle-aged man, he was actually an old monster that had lived for over nine thousand years.<br>The man&rsquo;s name was Tantai Xiangnan. He was the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, and an Utmost Exalted-level expert.<br>Amongst the Ten Great Heavenly Clans, the Linghu Heavenly Clan, Tantai Heavenly Clan and Jiaoli Heavenly Clan were all overseen by Utmost Exalted-level experts.<br>It was due to that Tantai Xiangnan&rsquo;s ability that the Tantai Heavenly Clan was publicly accepted to be the second strongest amongst the Ten Great Heavenly Clans, and able to obtain their current status.<br>Thus, even though there were many grand individuals from the Starfield Master Realm present, Tantai Xiangnan still did not appear to lose any of his magnificence.<br>Regardless of who might be present, Tantai Xiangnan would remain a top character.<br>This was the status he possessed in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>He was one of the few people that stood at the highest apex of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Tantai, since that isn&rsquo;t an abnormal sign caused by a Heavenly Bloodline possessor&rsquo;s breakthrough, do you know what sort of abnormal sign it is?&rdquo; asked Wuming Ken. Wuming Ken, someone with great status and power, was actually speaking with a very courteous tone towards the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I also cannot be certain about it. I think we will have to observe it for some more time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, is it possible to postpone the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars?&rdquo; Tantai Xiangnan asked Wuming Ken.<br>Although he addressed Wuming Ken as &lsquo;milord&rsquo;, there was no trace of humility in his tone.<br>He was only addressing Wuming Ken like that to show respect, and not because he was afraid of him.<br>Wuming Ken also knew that. After all, in terms of strength, he was much inferior to Tantai Xiangnan. In fact, in terms of status, power and influence, Tantai Xiangnan far surpassed him.<br>After all, Tantai Xiangnan was one of the few people in the Ancestral Martial Starfield that even the Starfield Master Realm needed to respect.<br>Whilst the Starfield Master Realm could ignore the others from the Tantai Heavenly Clan, they would not dare to ignore Tantai Xiangnan.<br>For Tantai Xiangnan to address him so respectfully before all those people, he was already giving him enormous face.<br>As Wuming Ken knew that Tantai Xiangnan was giving him face, he smiled and nodded at his proposal. &ldquo;What Clan Chief Tantai says is extremely correct. Since this abnormal sign has appeared so abruptly, it must be caused by something. Before we can figure out what is going on, it's best to postpone the selection.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Wuming Ken immediately announced that the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars would be suspended for the time being, and would begin again upon figuring out what the abnormal sign was, and whether or not it was dangerous.<br>&ldquo;We will know exactly what that abnormal sign is once we check it out.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a Martial Immortal-level expert soared into the sky and shot straight toward the surging lightning.<br>Seeing that someone had set off, several thousand people immediately soared into the sky.<br>This time around, there were not only Martial Immortal experts. Among them were several Exalted-level experts.<br>They were all bold and daring individuals. They all wanted to be the first to determine what had caused the abnormal sign. Thus, even though they knew it was dangerous, they still decided to brave the dangers.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, after those people entered the lightning, their bodies immediately shattered. They turned into gaseous flames that evaporated into thin air.<br>Died. All of them had died. Not to mention the Martial Immortal-level experts, even the Exalted-level experts died upon making contact with the lightning. They all died instantly, and not even their corpses remained. In fact, before their deaths, they were unable to even turn around to escape.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after those experts died, their clothes, their Cosmos Sacks, and the weapons that they were holding all started to fall from the sky.<br>It turned out that it was only the cultivators&rsquo; bodies that were shattered. Their possessions were completely undamaged.<br>All of this caused the situation to be even weirder.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here? What a terrifying abnormal sign! This is the first time I&rsquo;ve encountered such a terrifying abnormal sign!!!&rdquo;<br>The crowd&rsquo;s hearts tightened upon seeing such a thing happen. The people that were originally standing in midair hurriedly landed on the ground, or quickly distanced themselves from the lightning in the sky.<br>&ldquo;This is bad, this is truly bad!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why would such a terrifying sign appear out of nowhere?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, many people revealed great fear in their eyes as they looked to the lightning in the sky.<br>Although abnormal signs were extremely astonishing, very few actually possessed destructive capabilities.<br>The appearance of an abnormal sign with destructive capability would generally represent the descent of a calamity.<br>After all, it was a bad omen.<br>Compared to others, Chu Feng felt particularly uneasy.<br>The others were only able to witness how astonishing that abnormal sign was. They had only managed to witness the deaths of the people that came into contact with the lightning, and nothing else.<br>Different from the others, Chu Feng was able to clearly sense a pair of enormous eyes hidden within the astonishing abnormal sign. The reason why he was able to feel it so certainly was because the gaze from the enormous pair of eyes was on none other than him.<br></p></div>
