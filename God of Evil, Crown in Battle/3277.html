        <h1>Chapter 3276</h1>
        <div> - The Prophesied Child<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing there?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng started to panic. He thought that the spirit beast had disappeared, and immediately turned to look at the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram. However, when he did so, Chu Feng discovered that the spirit beast was still present.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you&rsquo;re unable to see that spirit beast?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief shook his head.<br>&ldquo;But it is clearly right there,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram once more. That vivid and lifelike spirit beast was still on the diagram.<br>&ldquo;I get it now. That Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram has recognized you as its master. Only you are able to see its contents. Apart from you, not to mention this old man, likely no one else would be able to see its contents.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reputation of the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagrams is truly well-deserved. Such a treasure is truly mystical,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief exclaimed in admiration. Then, he asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s written on it? Are you able to understand its contents?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It should be the location where that mysterious place is located. Apart from the map, there are some other indications too. Merely, I have yet to completely comprehend them. Oh, that&rsquo;s right, senior, is the Scarlet Province Upper Realm far from us?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The Scarlet Province Upper Realm is not far from us. It is also located in the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s eastern region.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that the mysterious place recorded in that Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram is located in the Scarlet Province Upper Realm?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;Speaking of it, I actually have a friendly relationship with the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Merely, whilst we do possess a friendly relationship, that old bastard is very stingy. If you plan to go and find something in his territory, it is best to not be discovered by him,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Wuma Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed upon hearing those words. Then, he asked, &ldquo;The Scarlet Province Upper Realm is under the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s control?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mn, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief answered.<br>&ldquo;Then&hellip; this would truly be an inevitable clash between enemies,&rdquo; Chu Feng sighed.<br>Back when Chu Feng was in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, he was all-seeing, as he possessed the grand formation.<br>Thus, he had discovered that, not long after he drove out the Linghu Heavenly Clan from the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, Wuma Shengjie also left the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>Likely, she had returned to her clan.<br>And now, the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram had opened. For the sake of the mysterious place recorded on the diagram, Chu Feng would definitely have to set foot in the Scarlet Province Upper Realm.<br>Although Chu Feng would definitely proceed to the Scarlet Province Upper Realm in secrecy so as to not expose himself, and even though the possibility of him encountering Wuma Shengjie was simply nil, they would still be in the same Upper Realm. As such, Chu Feng found it quite interesting.<br>&ldquo;Speaking of it, it would appear that a genius has also emerged from the Wuma Heavenly Clan this year. Furthermore, it seems like that genius is also training in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. Did you manage to encounter that genius?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;You must be talking about Wuma Shengjie,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It would seem that you&rsquo;ve encountered him,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all,&rdquo; Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from smiling.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that there are conflicts between the two of you. However, that&rsquo;s actually quite normal. After all, as youngsters, it is only natural to be proud and arrogant. That holds true even more in a place like the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Speaking of it, Chu Feng, since you&rsquo;ve encountered Wuma Shengjie, what do you think of that child?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;Wuma Shengjie is very strong and talented. Had I not obtained the cultivation resource left behind by my grandfather and received a shortcut to progress in my cultivation, likely, the one that defeated the Linghu Heavenly Clan and ruled over the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm would not have been me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Chu Feng was not trying to flatter Wuma Shengjie. Instead, he was truly thinking that that girl was a terrifying existence.<br>Had Chu Feng not obtained the power of the grand spirit formation, it would only have been a matter of time before Wuma Shengjie surpassed Linghu Tiemian.<br>&ldquo;For you to give such an evaluation, that Wuma Shengjie is truly remarkable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A while back, Exalted Heavenly Fate had made a prophecy. He prophesied that an exceptional genius would emerge from the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s eastern region. That child would make improvements at lightning speed, and be a match for the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s number one genius, Linghu Hongfei.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, Exalted Heavenly Fate prophesied that that child would be destined to battle Linghu Hongfei,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;I have also heard about that matter inside the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. Reportedly, the people outside were guessing that Wuma Shengjie was that prophesied individual,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That is indeed the case. Although Wuma Shengjie has never participated in the competition for the Ancestral Martial Decastars, his talent has already received acknowledgement from everyone. As such, when the exceptional genius was prophesied, the first person the crowd thought of was Wuma Shengjie.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what is your opinion regarding this matter?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;I have heard about Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s reputation. Not only is he the strongest of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, but his strength is also much superior to the person in second place. He is the number one genius of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. In fact, there are even people that believe that Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s talent surpasses that of my father,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That is indeed the case,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief nodded.<br>&ldquo;In that case, senior, what do you think? Do you think Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s talent is really that terrifying?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I have met Linghu Honfei before. That child is a dragon among men. His reputation as the number one genius of the Ancestral Martial Starfield is well-deserved. However, should he be compared to your father&hellip;.&rdquo;<br>As his words reached this point, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief suddenly stopped. Then, he smiled and shook his head.<br>The meaning behind his action was obvious.<br>&ldquo;I have not seen the days of my father&rsquo;s youth. However, I have heard about his accomplishments. I also feel that Linghu Hongfei is unqualified to be compared to my father.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back when my father&rsquo;s name shook the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, there should have been a lot of people who knew who he was. By contrast, Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s fame is also inferior to that of my father. As such, I truly do not understand why people would say that Linghu Hongfei will be able to surpass my father,&rdquo; Chu Feng was feeling a bit aggrieved.<br>The reason for that was because his father&rsquo;s accomplishments back in his youth had clearly reached a level so heaven-defying that no one could possibly compare to him. Yet now, there were actually people saying that someone who was inferior to his father was stronger than his father. With this, Chu Feng would naturally feel displeased.<br>After all, they were clearly talking drivel.<br>&ldquo;The world of martial cultivators is a world filled with pretense.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Apart from the fact that a portion of the people are truly dim-witted, the reason why Linghu Hongfei is able to enjoy such a high evaluation is mainly because his backer is the Linghu Heavenly Clan. His clan made it so that others had no choice but to flatter him,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from sighing. He felt what the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said to be very true.<br>&ldquo;You still haven&rsquo;t said anything about what you think of this prophesied battle,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;I do not know exactly what sort of strength Linghu Hongfei possesses.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I met and fought against Wuma Shengjie. Whilst Wuma Shengjie is no match for Linghu Hongfei now, I feel that he has the potential to catch up to him in the future,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What I wanted to ask you was about the prophesied child. Everyone is guessing that prophesied child to be Wuma Shengjie. Do you think their guess to be correct?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;This junior is uncertain,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Compared to your uncertainty, this old man instead feels that their guesses are completely wrong,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, why do you say that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because the prophesied child is clearly standing before this old man,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief looked to Chu Feng with a beaming smile. Expectations filled his eyes.<br></p></div>
