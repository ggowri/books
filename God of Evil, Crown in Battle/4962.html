        <div>: Saving Xian Miaomiao<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While the Zhuge Clan met with a tragic plight, Chu Feng and the others were busy constructing a formation under Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s instructions. With the combined prowess of the veteran world spiritists, they were able to finish constructing the formation within an hour.<br>Once it was done, Daoist Niantian, Shengguang Buyu, and Shengguang Baimei remained outside the drive the formation whereas Chu Feng, Master Yin Ren, and Princess Xiaoxiao entered the formation.<br>Princess Xiaoxiao first consumed a special pill before lying on the ground.<br>Master Yin Ren started setting up a formation around Princess Xiaoxiao.<br>The formation which Daoist Niantian and the others were channeling was just a conversion formation that allowed them to tap into the energy of the Soulhealing Formation. What was more important was the formation Master Yin Ren was constructing at the moment.<br>This was the formation that was linked to the one in Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s soul.<br>Xian Miaomiao was currently in an unconscious state. If they wished to save her, someone had to enter Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s soul.<br>Chu Feng would be the one to enter Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s soul in his soul state. He would decipher the formation in her soul and release the secret formation binding Xian Miaomiao.<br>Only then would he be able to safely extract Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s soul from Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s body.<br>In order to strengthen the formation, Master Yin Ren even placed the Ancient Era Realm Soulstone that was guarded by Daoist Niantian into the formation core.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you certain about it? If the formation isn&rsquo;t reliable, you might face grave danger,&rdquo; Yu Sha suddenly said.<br>She was worried.<br>&ldquo;Master Yin Ren has a deep understanding of world spiritist techniques. The formation he constructs should be reliable. I&rsquo;ve also taken a look myself, and it&rsquo;s impossible to save Miaomiao through just an external formation. Just as Master Yin Ren has mentioned, I need to enter Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s soul and directly set up a formation there. This is the only way to save her.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had been keeping a close eye on Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s movements.<br>He was a world spiritist himself too, so he was able to tell how delicate Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s movements were. The latter was indeed a top-notch world spiritist.<br>There was no doubt that Master Yin Ren did have the capability to construct a formation that allowed him to enter Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s soul.<br>Weng!<br>There was a brilliant outpour of light, and the complicated formation started coming together. It swiftly fused together, thus marking the completion of the formation.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, saving Princess Miaomiao won&rsquo;t be an easy feat. The slightest carelessness could spell a calamity. I know that you have the means to boost your spirit power, and the Soulhealing Formation will aid you, but the gap in spirit power is not that easy to bridge. So, I need you to remain in contact with me after entering Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s soul.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just make it clear here. If you wish to save Princess Miaomiao, you have to listen to my instructions. If the operation fails despite that, I&rsquo;m willing to offer my life up as compensation. However, if you refuse to heed my orders and unintentionally bring harm upon Princess Miaomiao or Princess Xiaoxiao, I won&rsquo;t go easy on you,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said grimly.<br>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re ready, head into the formation core and lie down,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said.<br>Chu Feng quickly did as he was told and lay down in the formation core.<br>Weng!<br>The formation began to whirl into action. Chu Feng could sense his soul being drawn out from his body and pulled into a peculiar formation tunnel. After passing through the tunnel, he successfully entered Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s soul and encountered Xian Miaomiao.<br>Even though he had known that Xian Miaomiao was inside Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s body, he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a stir in his heart seeing her up close. He felt a sliver of pain and delight.<br>He felt pained to see Xian Miaomiao being reduced to such a state, but he was delighted that she was unharmed. As long as he could bring her out, she should be able to recover to her original state without a problem.<br>The only problem was that it wasn&rsquo;t that easy to bring her out.<br>Xian Miaomiao had a powerful binding formation constructed around her soul that forced it to fuse together with Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s. If he wanted to drag Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s soul out, he would have to release the binding formation.<br>But that was easier said than done.<br>That was the reason why Chu Feng needed to enter this area as a soul.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you may start constructing the formation now,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s voice echoed in his ears.<br>Master Yin Ren had imparted to him a formation to release the binding formation earlier.<br>Chu Feng did what he was told and started constructing the formation. Being in a soul state had suppressed his spirit power to a certain degree, but it was fortunate that the enhancement from the Soulhealing Formation had limited the suppression.<br>His control of spirit power had always been superior to his peers, so it didn&rsquo;t take him much time to complete the formation. However, he realized that even though he had constructed the formation impeccably, it was unable to directly breach the formation that was binding Xian Miaomiao.<br>&ldquo;As expected of young friend Chu Feng. Despite being only at rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation, you were able to perfectly set up this counter formation. It looks like there&rsquo;s hope for Princess Miaomiao. This makes things a lot easier.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, what you have to do now is to link your soul to the counter formation and connect it to the formation binding Princess Miaomiao. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ll channel the formation from the outside. With our combined effort, we will be able to free Princess Miaomiao from the binding formation,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said.<br>&ldquo;Master Yin Ren, what if my soul is unable to withstand the tug and pull between the two formations?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt that getting caught between two formations will be painful for you, but it should be tolerable to you considering your willpower. You have to allow the spirit power to flow through your body. Make sure not to resist at all. If so, you should be fine,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren replied.<br>&ldquo;Master Yin Ren, even though the formation binding Miaomiao is complicated, there are other ways to breach it. Why don&rsquo;t you allow me to use my way instead? Perhaps my method may work better,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he prepared to set up another formation of his own.<br></p></div>
