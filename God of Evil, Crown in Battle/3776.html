        <h1>Chapter 3775</h1>
        <div> - Old Freak Tang<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Grandfather, do you know who exactly that senior Asura from earlier was?&rdquo; the young woman asked her grandfather.<br>She was now filled with admiration and even slight adoration for Chu Feng. Thus, she wanted to know who he was.<br>However, the old man shook his head at the young woman&rsquo;s question.<br>Seeing that her grandfather actually did not know who Chu Feng was, the young woman felt that it was truly a pity.<br>&ldquo;Mister Asura is most likely a hidden expert.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To him, providing guidance to us was merely a trivial matter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it is a long-cherished wish of mine; of this Shuijing Dongtian, to obtain this Immortal Technique.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, no matter what, I must find Mister Asura and properly express my thanks," the old man said with a look of gratitude.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Meanwhile. Chu Feng had arrived at Autumnfall Village.<br>Although Autumnfall Village was located at the foot of the Seven Suns Mountain Range, it was not a paradise of a place. Instead, it appeared extremely ordinary, and even slightly impoverished.<br>Even the villagers appeared to be rather poverty-stricken. This village was simply a place where ordinary people lived. Although all the villagers were martial cultivators, their cultivations were simply too weak.<br>That said, Chu Feng was not surprised by how impoverished the village was.<br>According to Grandmaster Liangqiu, this place should be the hometown of that Mister Tang.<br>Thus, it was most likely not because he was fond of the place&rsquo;s scenery that Mister Tang decided to enter closed-door training there. Rather, it would be because the place gave him the feeling of being in one&rsquo;s hometown.<br>After Chu Feng arrived at the village, he began to make inquiries, and learned that there were three families in the village with the surname Tang.<br>After filtering through the three families, Chu Feng focused his attention on an old man.<br>The other two families with the surname Tang had been residing in the village for a very long time. They had practically never left the village, and did not resemble the person Chu Feng was searching for.<br>The only difference would be an old man that was surnamed Tang.<br>That old man was an outsider. He was not someone from the village.<br>He arrived at the village over two hundred years ago. He was a world spiritist, and would spend his days concocting medicinal pellets or creating weapons to sell.<br>Due to the fact that the old man had an eccentric temperament, the people in the village all addressed him as Old Freak Tang.<br>&ldquo;Cough, cough, cough~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng arrived at Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s residence.<br>Upon arrival, Chu Feng heard a series of violent coughs.<br>Out of respect for Old Freak Tang, Chu Feng did not conceal his cultivation.<br>In fact, he even removed his disguise to reveal his actual appearance.<br>Naturally, he also did not use any special methods to observe the situation inside.<br>Thus, Chu Feng did not know what the conditions inside were like, and what Old Freak Tang looked like. However, from the intense coughing, Chu Feng determined that Old Freak Tang seemed to be in bad health.<br>&ldquo;Senior Tang, please excuse me for disturbing you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This junior is named Chu Feng. I was asked to pay senior Tang a visit by Grandmaster Liangqiu,&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke with his fist clasped as he stood outside the entrance.<br>&ldquo;Creak~~~&rdquo;<br>The shabby entrance door was pushed open and an aged old man appeared before Chu Feng.<br>That person was as thin as a match. His eye sockets were sunken and he was so old that he only had a few gray hairs on his head. It would be one thing if he were completely bald. Yet, the few strands of hair on his near-bald head just made him appear very messy, and slightly ugly.<br>Most importantly, that Old Freak Tang not only had a crafty look, but his eyes were also very ominous-looking. At first glance, he seemed like a humanoid monster.<br>Fortunately, Chu Feng was a person who had experienced a lot. If it were a child that had seen Old Freak Tang, they would likely burst into tears out of fear.<br>&ldquo;What did you mutter earlier?&rdquo;<br>Not only did the old man have a vicious look, but his tone was also very vicious.<br>&ldquo;Senior, are you senior Tang?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with his fist clasped.<br>&ldquo;Can you not see that word?&rdquo;<br>The old man pointed to the crude board above the entrance. Written on it was &lsquo;Tang&rsquo;s Smithy.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;This junior was impolite, I hope senior Tang will not take offense.&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist respectfully in an apologetic manner.<br>&ldquo;Enough with the senior this and senior that. Do not speak so weirdly to me. Go ahead and tell me what you want. Do you want to forge a weapon, or do you want to concoct a medicinal pellet?&rdquo; Old Freak Tang spoke with great impatience.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this junior is not looking to concoct a medicinal pellet or forge a weapon,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Then why did you come here? Get the hell out." Old Freak Tang glared at Chu Feng with great annoyance. He planned to close the door.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before the door could close, Chu Feng grabbed it.<br>Old Freak Tang tried to forcibly fling the door shut, only to discover that the door had turned as heavy as a boulder, and he was unable to move it at all.<br>At that moment, panic appeared on his previously fierce and vicious face.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; who are you?!&rdquo; Old Freak Tang asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, let us talk inside.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he entered the house and closed the door behind him.<br>After entering the house, Chu Feng discovered that the house was very messy. The great majority of the things in the house were related to world spirit techniques. They were either for forging weaponry or concocting medicinal pellets. However, they were all very rudimentary items.<br>As for things relating to curses, Chu Feng was unable to detect any.<br>&ldquo;Mi-Milord, this old man was in the wrong earlier. I have eyes, but failed to recognize Mount Tai.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, please don&rsquo;t take offense. Please don&rsquo;t lower yourself to this lowly one&rsquo;s level.&rdquo;<br>After entering the house, Old Freak Tang immediately started pleading. He not only did not possess his previous arrogant attitude, but he instead became extremely courteous, and was even stuttering as he spoke.<br>This made Chu Feng realize that Old Freak Tang was actually a paper tiger.<br>But, this shouldn&rsquo;t be the case...<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s friend shouldn&rsquo;t be such an ordinary person.<br>&ldquo;Senior, do you still remember Grandmaster Liangqiu from the Ancestral Martial Starfield?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng did not directly mention his purpose in coming. Instead, he began to question this Old Freak Tang.<br>He wanted to confirm if he had mistaken him for Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s friend.<br>&ldquo;Ancestral Martial Starfield? Milord, you must&rsquo;ve mistaken me for someone else.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only an ordinary commoner. I&rsquo;ve never even been out of the Reincarnation Upper Realm, how could I possibly know someone from the Ancestral Martial Starfield?&rdquo; said Old Man Tang.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s focus was fixed onto Old Freak Tang as he spoke. He discovered that even though Old Freak Tang had a look of fear on his face and appeared completely flustered, he did not appear to be lying.<br>&ldquo;Senior, my apologies. I disturbed you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng clasped his fist. After saying those words, he left.<br>Chu Feng felt that he had likely found the wrong person. However, he was unwilling to give up.<br>Thus, he appeared like he had left the village, but actually stayed outside the village to monitor the entire village.<br>He changed his appearance back to that of Asura. Furthermore, he was using his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to observe that Old Freak Tang.<br>To Chu Feng&rsquo;s delight, that Old Freak Tang was indeed not as simple as he appeared to be.<br></p></div>
