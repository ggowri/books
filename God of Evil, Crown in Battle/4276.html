        <div> - Terrifying Vortex<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;This junior cannot guarantee that I will definitely be able to open that lock. But, I will give my full effort,&rdquo; said Chu Feng as he began to attempt to open the lock.<br>He had been observing the lock the entire time.<br>That lock was not something that could be opened using world spirit techniques. It does not care if one&rsquo;s world spirit techniques were powerful or not.<br>What was required to open the lock was the power of a world spiritist&rsquo;s bloodline. In other words, it relies on the foundation of a world spiritist.<br>To other people, perhaps it would be impossible to open this lock their entire life.<br>No matter how powerful their world spirit techniques reached, no matter how much progress they made, they will not be able to open the lock as their talent as a world spiritist would be lacking.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng was uncertain if he would be able to open the lock either.<br>He doesn&rsquo;t know if his talent and bloodline&rsquo;s powers had reached the required level.<br>He could only give it a try.<br>&ldquo;Snap---&rdquo;<br>However, right after Chu Feng began his attempt, the lock actually opened right away.<br>It was much simpler than Chu Feng anticipated.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Even Old Man Compliance was stunned by this scene.<br>&ldquo;It really opened.&rdquo;<br>OId Man Compliance examined the lock repeatedly. After confirming that the lock was indeed open, the shock on his face grew even stronger.<br>Then, he looked to Chu Feng with a complicated smile.<br>&ldquo;For the sake of opening this lock, this old man had attempted all sorts of methods and exhausted a great amount of effort. Yet, they were all useless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Never would I imagine that the lock would open that easily for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, your talent has simply reached an unimaginable level.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is no wonder that you&rsquo;re able to easily ascend onto this Ancient Compliance Castle&rsquo;s Talent Steps&rsquo; third step.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fortunately, this old man was lucky. If you were the one to encounter this Ancient Compliance Castle, you will definitely be the one to inherit it. It definitely wouldn&rsquo;t end up with this old man.&rdquo;<br>Old Man Compliance praised Chu Feng nonstop. He was praising Chu Feng with sincerity from the bottom of his heart.<br>Not only that, one could even hear envy in his voice.<br>As a world spiritist, how could one not be envious of such a powerfully talented individual?<br>Even though effort was indispensable for training in either martial cultivation or world spirit techniques, the difference in talent was not something that effort could make up for.<br>&ldquo;Wuu---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed enormously.<br>A painful look covered his face.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re&hellip; poisoned?&rdquo;<br>Old Man Compliance became extremely worried seeing Chu Feng like this. He immediately began to diagnose Chu Feng&rsquo;s condition.<br>He quickly determined that there was poison in Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>Indeed, Chu Feng was poisoned. This poison was inflicted onto Chu Feng by the mysterious existence in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm&rsquo;s Nine Dragon Abnormal Sign Mound.<br>Chu Feng was unable to stop the break out of this poison. Furthermore, every break out was worse than the previous.<br>This time was even more dangerous than last.<br>The moment that poison broke out, Chu Feng knew that an unbearable torture will befall him.<br>Suddenly, a refreshing aura entered through his nose.<br>Once that refreshing aura entered his body, Chu Feng felt relaxed and alerted. Even the poison that was erupting in his body began to calm down slightly.<br>Chu Feng opened his eyes and discovered that it was Old Man Compliance.<br>Old Man Compliance was holding a bottle in his hand. That bottle appeared very ordinary. Yet, the light blue gas emitted from the bottom was so very magical.<br>That refreshing aura was precisely that light blue gas.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, breath in this gas.&rdquo;<br>Old Man Compliance brought the bottle over to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng did not hesitate and began to breathe hard. In no time, he breathed in all the light blue gas from the bottle.<br>To Chu Feng&rsquo;s great surprise, the poison within him actually calmed down after he breathed in all the light blue gas.<br>Although the light blue gas did not rid the poison that was about to flare up, it managed to suppress it.<br>Furthermore, this was the most serious time that poison flared up.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what is this?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s merely a simple antidote,&rdquo; said Old Man Compliance.<br>&ldquo;A simple antidote?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng opened his eyes wide. When he looked to Old Man Compliance again, he suddenly realized that Old Man Compliance was even more remarkable than what he had heard.<br>To be able to suppress the poison within him, it would not be excessive to call that light blue gas a miracle cure.<br>Yet, old man compliance said it was only a simple antidote.<br>From this, it could be seen that the medicinal gas was truly not especially valuable for Old Man Compliance.<br>&ldquo;This old man is only able to suppress the poison within you. It will be hazardous to attempt to remove it completely.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, tell me where you received this poison from.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if I can help you with removing it,&rdquo; said Old Man Compliance.<br>Hearing that, Chu Feng did not conceal anything and informed Old Man Compliance of everything that happened.<br>If it was someone else, they will, to some extent, feel fear after hearing that story. After all, an existence like that hidden beneath the earth would cause anyone&rsquo;s hair to stand on end.<br>But, Old Man Compliance showed no fear. In fact, there wasn&rsquo;t even a trace of shock in his eyes.<br>He remained very calm. It seemed as if he was hearing something very ordinary.<br>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s a place called the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound in the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s Nine Dragons Upper Realm?&rdquo; asked Old Man Compliance.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;<br>Old Man Compliance nodded his head. Then, he took out a scroll.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>Upon opening the scroll, endless stars could be seen in the scroll.<br>Those stars appeared so vivid and life-like. It seemed as if the scroll really does contain the vast starry sky.<br>Old Man Compliance inspected the scroll before pointing circling one a field of stars in the scroll with his finger.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>Then, the starfield that was circled began to shine brightly. Furthermore, names appeared on every star in that starfield.<br>Nine Dragons Upper Realm, Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm and various other familiar names appeared. They were all inscribed onto the various stars.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng realized that the field of stars that Old Man Compliance circled was the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>At this moment, Old Man Compliance pointed his finger to the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>Once he pointed at the star, the entire scroll began to transform. The vast amount of stars disappeared and was replaced by an extensive world map.<br>That was the map of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.<br>Soon, Old Man Compliance found the position of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.<br>He took out a black pearl from his Cosmos Sack and pinched it between two fingers of his right hand.<br>With his left hand, he began to form special hand seals all the while incanting with his mouth.<br>Then, he pointed at the position of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound with his right hand. The black pearl he held with two fingers turned into a black gas that entered into the direction of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.<br>&ldquo;Rumble---&rdquo;<br>Ear-piercing rumbles sounded from outside.<br>The rumbles were extremely resounding. It sounded as if all the mountains and rivers of the world were being destroyed. Hearing the rumbling, Chu Feng felt extremely uneasy.<br>Thus, he immediately looked outside.<br>&ldquo;That is?!&rdquo;<br>Originally, Chu Feng cannot see the situation outside inside the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>But, perhaps because Old Man Compliance had removed some sort of special restrictions, Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes was able to allow him to clearly see the situation outside.<br>At this moment, the people outside all had looks of shock on their faces. They were looking ahead of the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>The reason for that was because an enormous vortex appeared before the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>That vortex was pitch-black. Its size was so enormous that it resembled a giant object that ran through both heaven and earth.<br>Even the Ancient Compliance Castle, a colossus in its own right, appeared extremely small before the vortex.<br>As for martial cultivators, they were simply akin to dust before that vortex.<br>Once this enormous vortex appeared, the surroundings immediately started to transform. As the vortex rotated, powerful wind swept all around.<br>Dust and rocks were being blown all around. The violent wind sent the entire region into complete chaos. It seemed as if doomsday was arriving.<br>Most importantly, the vortex was pitch-black in color. It seemed like a gate leading to hell.<br>One felt fear just from seeing it.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br>Not to mention the others, even Grandmaster Tang Chen and Celestial Fairy Muzhi had frightened looks on their faces.<br>&ldquo;That seemed like a spirit formation gate,&rdquo; said Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Compared to them, Ox-nosed Old Daoist was rather calm.<br>&ldquo;Spirit formation gate? How could there be such an enormous spirit formation gate?&rdquo; asked Celestial Fairy Muzhi and Grandmaster Tang Chen in shock.<br>Even for them, it was their first time witnessing such an enormous spirit formation gate.<br>But, it does indeed resemble a spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;Senior, that&hellip; was it caused by you?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng turned to Old Man Compliance.<br>Compared to others, Old Man Compliance was still completely calm.<br>Connecting the series of actions he did before, Chu Feng felt that the enormous vortex that connected heaven and earth could very possibly be caused by Old Man Compliance.<br>&ldquo;Whoever started it shall end it. The poison in your body should be removed by that guy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve helped this old man enormously. As such, I must return you the favor.&rdquo;<br>As Old Man Compliance spoke, the Ancient Compliance Castle began to move toward the pitch-black vortex that connected heaven and earth.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng was certain that the terrifying vortex was indeed caused by Old Man Compliance.<br></p></div>
