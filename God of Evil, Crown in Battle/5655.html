        <h1>Chapter 5655: It’s Fair Now</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Fu Xing was still trying to figure out what was happening, the black humanoid figure looked at Chu Feng and smiled, saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an interesting one.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t respond to the remark, but it piqued Fu Xing&rsquo;s interest as she asked, &ldquo;Elder, what do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I can sense his psyche. He has been trying to decipher the murals in this hall after consuming the black fruit, but the black fruit&rsquo;s effect has already worn off. It&rsquo;s impossible for him to figure out the murals with his intelligence. It&rsquo;s futile no matter how hard he tries. He&rsquo;s only stalling for time,&rdquo; the black humanoid figure said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a secret hidden in the murals?&rdquo; Fu Xing widened her eyes in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She did attempt to examine the murals after raising her intelligence too, but it was to no avail. That led her to conclude that there was no secret in the murals, so she focused her psyche on making a breakthrough instead. While she didn&rsquo;t make a breakthrough, her earlier reflection built up a strong foundation for her to achieve a breakthrough in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the black humanoid figure&rsquo;s words made her realize that she was wrong. It turned out that the true treasure in this hall lay in the murals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s smarter than you, but not by much.&rdquo; the black humanoid figure said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned to Chu Feng, only to shake his head in disappointment when he saw the latter refusing to open his eyes and get up. &ldquo;Stop pretending. I know you have figured something out, but time&rsquo;s up. You have to bear the consequences of eating the black fruit now. You have remained safe thus far despite having obtained so many </span><span>fruits because that lass from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has suppressed the danger of the black fruit back then, but her seal only goes this far. You&rsquo;ll have to bear the burden yourselves now.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following those words, a surge of teleportation energy ejected Chu Feng and Fu Xing from the hall, and the doors leading into the hall began to close on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the ground started to tremble. It wasn&rsquo;t just the hall that was shaking but the entire world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Fu Xing urgently asked the black humanoid figure before the doors closed, sensing that something was amiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the black humanoid figure&rsquo;s eyes remained fixated on Chu Feng as he shook his head in disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weng!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng suddenly formed a seal with his left hand while clenching his right fist tight, and it produced a burst of light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You actually&hellip;&rdquo; The black humanoid figure&rsquo;s disappointed expression was replaced with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That sword&hellip; What a formidable sealing formation!&rdquo; Fu Xing noticed that the burst of light coming from Chu Feng was a powerful sword manifested from an extremely complicated formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, I am indeed stalling for time, but it&rsquo;s not to comprehend the murals but to construct the formation. Thank you for your help.&rdquo; Chu Feng quickly got up and bowed to the black humanoid figure inside the hall before the doors fully closed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he turned around and rushed out with the sealing formation he had manifested in the form of a sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, he had already realized the true nature of this place before challenging the trial. While consuming the fruits boosted one&rsquo;s psyche, they would summon a terrifying ferocious beast. The more potent the fruit, the more terrifying the ferocious beast summoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were able to obtain so many fruits without summoning any ferocious beasts only because the ferocious beasts had been sealed inside an altar. The altar was currently sealed off by Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span> through the sealing formation imbued in the </span><span>Purpledemon</span><span> Dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sealing formation was designed to suppress the ferocious beasts inside the altar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murals in the hall where the purple ferocious beast lurked detailed not just the formation to uncover the hidden hall of the black ferocious beast but the altar&rsquo;s sealing formation too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was with this sealing formation that Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span> sealed away the ferocious beasts centuries ago, but the sealing formation wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to suppress the stronger ferocious beast that would spawn from Chu Feng and Fu Xing&rsquo;s consumption of the black fruits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng, who had known this from the start, quickly put the two and two together, and his deduction was further verified by his question of whether the black fruit was poisonous. That was why he confidently consumed it without any hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had known what the outcome was from the start, and he was confident that he </span><span>could deal with it. That was why he didn&rsquo;t attempt to make a breakthrough when his intelligence surged but instead deciphered the content of the murals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a success, and he grasped the sealing formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had also figured out that someone was controlling the emergence of the ferocious beasts from the altar, and he deduced that the culprit was the black humanoid figure. That was why he intentionally stalled for time so as to ensure that he could construct the sealing formation before the other party released the ferocious beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His guess was on the dot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black humanoid figure released the ferocious beasts when he thought that Chu Feng had failed, as indicated by the violent tremors, though there was nothing to worry about now since Chu Feng had already constructed the sealing formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The altar was cracked by the time he arrived. Jie </span><span>Ranqing&rsquo;s</span><span> </span><span>Purpledemon</span><span> Dagger was shaking violently, looking as if it would drop off at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any hesitation, he leaped forward and pulled out the </span><span>Purpledemon</span><span> Dagger while simultaneously attempting to plunge his sword into the altar. The altar released a powerful force the moment he pulled out the </span><span>Purpledemon</span><span> Dagger, such that it took him a great deal of effort and time before he pushed the sword fully into the altar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trembling stopped as soon as the sword was completely inserted into the altar, and the cracks on the altar disappeared as if they were just an illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hu! That was a close shave.&rdquo; Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief as he sat down on the altar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he failed to insert the sword into the altar on time, the ferocious beasts would have escaped, and both he and Fu Xing would be goners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, a-are you a descendant of Lord Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span>?&rdquo; a voice suddenly echoed from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shocked, Chu Feng turned around and saw Fu Xing staring at the </span><span>Purpledemon</span><span> Dagger in his hand. He was so focused on inserting his sword into the altar that he hadn&rsquo;t noticed her arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, she knew that only Jie </span><span>Ranqing&rsquo;s</span><span> parents and descendants were able to hold onto and use the </span><span>Purpledemon</span><span> Dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng breathed a sigh of relief upon seeing that it was Fu Xing, and he said with a grin, &ldquo;Now that I have a secret you need to guard as well, we&rsquo;re equals.&rdquo;</span></p></div>
