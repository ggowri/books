        <h1>Chapter 5272</h1>
        <div>: Sportsmanship<br>&ldquo;Brother, wait for me,&rdquo; the little monk said before confidently stepping into the tower.<br>Xu Tianjian quickly followed the little monk in.<br>Meanwhile, in the formation space up in the sky, the demon monk was still crossing blows with the mysterious woman. The red and black auras were clashing with even greater fervor than before.<br>This was a fight on a completely different scale, devastating everything in its path.<br>Humans looked ever so insignificant in the face of such tremendous might, but how ironic it was that this destruction was being caused by these insignificant ones.<br>The mysterious woman hadn&rsquo;t sustained any injuries. She stood with her usual air of loftiness, but her gaze wasn&rsquo;t as calm as it used to be. She knew that there was a huge gap in cultivation between her and the demon monk.<br>She was only able to stand against the demon monk thanks to the overpowered treasures she had, but those treasures were already reaching their limits. To make things worse, the demon monk didn&rsquo;t seem to be exerting his full strength.<br>The gap between them was too huge.<br>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; the mysterious woman shouted.<br>The red aura stopped their aggression.<br>At the same time, the black aura also trailed to a halt too.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, lass?&rdquo; the demon monk asked with a teasing smile.<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you ask who I am earlier?&rdquo; the mysterious woman asked.<br>&ldquo;Are you finally willing to speak?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You have grown much stronger over the years. There&rsquo;s a good chance that you&rsquo;ll be able to exact your vengeance on the Totem Dragon Clan. However, I am not affiliated with the Totem Dragon Clan in any way. I&rsquo;m only here because of Chu Feng. There&rsquo;s no need for us to turn on each other.<br>&ldquo;You just have to promise me that you won&rsquo;t hurt Chu Feng, and I&rsquo;ll turn a blind eye to your actions. On the other hand, if you dare to hurt Chu Feng, I guarantee you that you won&rsquo;t live for long,&rdquo; the mysterious woman said with a cold glint in her eyes.<br>She was threatening the demon monk with absolute confidence. She might be weaker than the demon monk now, but she was confident that she would surpass him in due time!<br>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo; The demon monk burst into laughter.<br>&ldquo;Lass, do you think that I can&rsquo;t tell that you&rsquo;re at your limit? I&rsquo;ve told you that it&rsquo;s not up to me whether Chu Feng lives or not. If Chu Feng knows his place, he can survive this ordeal without a hitch. If he doesn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;ll die in the hands of my disciple. You ought to be worrying more about yourself now,&rdquo; the demon monk said with a sly smile.<br>Woosh!<br>Countless sharp talons manifested from the black aura swiped at the mysterious woman. The might of this attack was several times greater than in their previous clashes.<br>The demon monk had been secretly preparing for this attack while they were chatting!<br>The mysterious woman hurriedly gathered the red aura to protect herself, but it was to no avail. The black aura penetrated the red aura barriers with ease.<br>The woman was in a dire position, but instead of panicking, she smiled.<br>Boom!<br>The black aura quashed the red aura with absolute superiority before flooding the area around the mysterious woman, entrapping her. At this point, it no longer mattered what kind of powerful treasures she had. She was doomed to be crushed into bits.<br>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Yet, the demon monk frowned.<br>The mysterious woman had vanished into thin air, leaving just a message behind.<br>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have made an enemy out of me.&rdquo;<br>It was a menacing threat.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; The demon monk clenched his fists in anger. He didn&rsquo;t think that the mysterious woman would be able to slip away under his nose.<br>He knew that the mysterious woman had powerful backing. Her escape spelled trouble for him.<br>&ldquo;That young miss&rsquo; escape means are far superior to her offensive means. There&rsquo;s no way you could have trapped her here. There&rsquo;s a good chance that she&rsquo;ll inform the Totem Dragon Clan about our presence here. You should prepare yourself for battle,&rdquo; the person standing beneath the cauldron said.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, Brother Ren. The Totem Dragon Clan is just a bunch of small fry. I wasn&rsquo;t a match for them back then, but I&rsquo;m not the same person I used to be. Even if Long Junlin comes here, he&rsquo;s only marching to his death,&rdquo; the demon monk said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate Long Junlin. He&rsquo;s not someone to be trifled with. I still need more time. You have to stop him by any means, or else our efforts will go down the drain,&rdquo; the person standing beneath the cauldron said with a worried tone.<br>&ldquo;Brother Ren, you don&rsquo;t have to worry. I know what I am doing. I&rsquo;d rather they come here themselves so that I&rsquo;d be spared the effort of looking for them,&rdquo; the demon monk said with a smile.<br>Despite failing to capture the mysterious woman, he was confident about dealing with the Totem Dragon Clan.<br>&hellip;<br>Meanwhile, Ling&rsquo;er had concealed herself not too far away from where the Trial of the Strongest was hosted. Cold sweat flowed down her cheeks as she nervously stared at the sky above.<br>Weng!<br>A spirit formation gate opened next to her, and the mysterious woman stepped out from within. Other than her eyes reverting back to normal, she looked exactly the same as when she left.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, are you fine?&rdquo; Ling&rsquo;er quickly rushed forward to check the mysterious woman&rsquo;s condition, worried that she had sustained injuries.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Ling&rsquo;er. I&rsquo;m just worried about Chu Feng,&rdquo; the mysterious woman said.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Ling&rsquo;er asked.<br>&ldquo;The demon monk has reached a terrifying level. I&rsquo;m afraid that even Long Junlin wouldn&rsquo;t be a match for him. I have also depleted the treasures that my master has given me, so I won&rsquo;t be able to interfere in this matter,&rdquo; the mysterious woman said.<br>&ldquo;The demon monk has become that powerful?&rdquo; Ling&rsquo;er was astonished.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. What&rsquo;s even more frightening is that the demon monk has a helper. They are harnessing some kind of energy, and if they succeed, the Totem Dragon Clan won&rsquo;t stand a chance at all. I have already informed the Totem Dragon Clan about the matter, but those arrogant fools disregarded my words and even attacked me. Chu Feng only has himself to rely on this time around,&rdquo; the mysterious woman said.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, you shouldn&rsquo;t blame yourself for this. We aren&rsquo;t related to Chu Feng in the first place. You only intervened because you thought that it was a pity for a prodigy of his caliber to lose his life here. You have already done everything that you could for him. If he still loses his life despite your best efforts, we can only say that it&rsquo;s his fate,&rdquo; Ling&rsquo;er said.<br>She did think that it was a pity for Chu Feng to die here too, but she didn&rsquo;t feel any emotional attachment to him. What she was more concerned about was the young miss&rsquo; emotional state.<br>The mysterious woman took out the mirror, but due to her moving away from the trial location, she was no longer able to see Chu Feng in it anymore. Heavensight&rsquo;s effect had also worn off, so she could no longer see what was happening inside the trial.<br>&ldquo;Haaa&hellip; I can only wish him all the best,&rdquo; the mysterious woman said.<br>&hellip;<br>A tense atmosphere had gripped the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s underground palace.<br>A mysterious woman had paid them a visit not too long ago. She informed them that the demon monk was still alive and was in the midst of preparing a powerful means to deal with them. She urged them to quickly stop him.<br>However, they were so taken aback by how their hidden hideout had been breached that the first thought that occurred to them was that the mysterious woman was the demon monk&rsquo;s subordinate.<br>Long Junlin had even personally made a move to take down the mysterious woman, only for the latter to slip away.<br>This left them extremely uneasy.<br>Long Junlin was one of the strongest cultivators of the Totem Dragon Clan. The fact that the mysterious woman was able to slip away from him showed that she was even more powerful than the demon monk they had encountered back then.<br>&ldquo;Milord, it looks like we have underestimated the demon monk&rsquo;s subordinate.&rdquo;<br>The crowd turned to look at Long Junlin.<br>They didn&rsquo;t want to believe that the demon monk was still alive, so they were more inclined to think that the mysterious woman was the demon monk&rsquo;s subordinate.<br>Long Junlin had an awful look on his face.<br>The Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant was of great importance to their Totem Dragon Clan. They even went to the extent of keeping this matter a secret from their guest elders so as to prevent news from leaking out. The only ones who should have known about the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant were their own clansmen.<br>Yet, the news still ended up leaking out somehow, and their adversary was stronger than they had expected.<br>How could they not be unnerved?<br>&ldquo;Inform the clan that there&rsquo;s an emergency here, and urge them to dispatch reinforcement over as soon as possible!&rdquo; Long Junlin ordered.<br>This was a difficult call for him to make.<br>This order was an implicit acknowledgment that he couldn&rsquo;t resolve the problem by himself, and it would indubitably diminish his prestige in the clan. Even so, he chose to prioritize the Totem Dragon Clan over his own honor.<br>The others also understood the severity of the situation. One of the elders quickly took Long Junlin&rsquo;s token to relay the news back to the clan.<br>&ldquo;The woman mentioned the location of the demon monk earlier. Do you remember it?&rdquo; Long Junlin asked.<br>&ldquo;We did, but milord, this could be a trap if that woman is truly the demon monk&rsquo;s subordinate,&rdquo; someone replied.<br>&ldquo;It might be a trap, but it&rsquo;s also possible that the mysterious woman is reminding us out of goodwill. The demon monk might still be alive and is attempting to make a comeback. Think about it. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense for the mysterious woman to show herself and relay this news when she could have simply ambushed us,&rdquo; Long Junlin said.<br>He didn&rsquo;t blindly choose to shrug off the mysterious woman&rsquo;s words. Rather, he decided to prepare for all possible situations so as to safeguard the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant.<br>&hellip;<br>None of the cultivators gathered in Skydomain Lower Realm were aware of the danger creeping on them. Those inside the trial were still fighting to prove themselves, whereas those outside were waiting for the results of the tournament.<br>Chu Feng stood at the peak of the tower, waiting for his opponent to show himself.<br>&ldquo;Incredible. That little monk is actually able to hold his own against Xu Tianjian for so long. It seems like we have another dark horse here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How unexpected!&rdquo;<br>The crowd outside the tower chatted amongst themselves.<br>They thought that the battle between Xu Tianjian and the little monk would be swiftly concluded, but it was taking longer than they had expected. This could only mean that the two of them were having an intense showdown.<br>It was an interesting turn of events that defied the crowd&rsquo;s expectations, and it piqued their interest.<br>Bam!<br>After an hour had passed, the tower gates finally opened and the little monk was hurtled out.<br>The little monk crashed onto the floor. His body was covered with his blood, and his left hand had been severed. There was a huge fatal gash on his neck. Countless injuries covered his body. Those who saw his state couldn&rsquo;t help but cringe and avert their eyes.<br>The little monk had fallen in defeat.<br>On the other hand, Xu Tianjian was teleported to the peak of the tower, but he wasn&rsquo;t in a good state either. There were no visible injuries on him, but his face was ghastly white. The moment he appeared, he fell to his knees, barely supported by the sword in his trembling grip. Fresh blood kept flowing from his palm.<br>&ldquo;Xu Tianjian is severely injured?&rdquo;<br>If the crowd was still unsure earlier, they were now certain that the little monk was a formidable cultivator. Otherwise, Xu Tianjian wouldn&rsquo;t have sustained such severe injuries.<br>It was clearly a close fight between the two of them!<br>&ldquo;My apologies, I have embarrassed myself here. It looks like I won&rsquo;t be able to cross blows with you anymore.&rdquo;<br>The little monk looked at Chu Feng with an embarrassed smile. Despite his severe injuries, he was more concerned that he wasn&rsquo;t able to keep his promise and fight Chu Feng in the finals.<br>&ldquo;Recuperate well. Let&rsquo;s fight another day,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the little monk replied with a nod.<br>Weng!<br>A surge of teleportation energy transported Chu Feng and Xu Tianjian to the highest tower, where the strongest token was finally within their reach.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, I am severely injured. Could you give me some time to recuperate?&rdquo; Xu Tianjian asked.<br>&ldquo;Go ahead. I&rsquo;ll wait for you,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;You have my gratitude,&rdquo; Xu Tianjian replied with a clasped fist.<br>He swallowed a bunch of pills before sitting cross-legged on the floor to heal his injuries.<br>The little monk did the same too.<br>Two hours later, Xu Tianjian&rsquo;s complexion finally looked a little better. He rose to his feet and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept you waiting, young hero Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you sure that you&rsquo;re fine now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, I am already deeply grateful that you&rsquo;re willing to wait two hours for me. I can&rsquo;t keep you waiting any longer,&rdquo; Xu Tianjian said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t stand on ceremony and entered the tower. Xu Tianjian did the same too.<br>Bam!<br>Shortly after the gates closed, Chu Feng felt a chill behind his back.<br>Xu Tianjian had made a move right away!<br>&ldquo;Heck! Does he have no sportsmanship?&rdquo; Chu Feng berated in his mind.<br></div>
