        <h1>Chapter 4121</h1>
        <div> - Space-time Vortex<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After they left the blazing cliff, Chu Feng&rsquo;s suspended heart was finally lifted.<br>After all, as long as they left the blazing cliff, it would mean that they would&rsquo;ve returned to the Demon Vanquishing Clan&rsquo;s territory.<br>With the restraint of the Demon Vanquishing Talisman, they no longer had to fear the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts.<br>Compared to Chu Feng, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was still terrified by what had happened earlier.<br>Even though they had already exited the cliff, fear still covered her face,<br>&ldquo;Truly never would I have imagined that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts that we regularly bully are actually so terrifying.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thinking back to how my forefathers were actually able to contend against those terrifying monsters, what sort of cultivation did they possess?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder grandma always says that our Demon Vanquishing Clan has fallen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The disparity between us and our forefathers is simply too great.&rdquo; After her feeling of fear passed, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er sighed.<br>Compared to her, Fumo Shaoyu was more concerned with whether or not they could smoothly leave the Heaven-Devouring Realm.<br>After all, they&rsquo;d gathered everything they needed.<br>Whether or not they could succeed would all be determined now.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, with your world spirit techniques, it shouldn&rsquo;t be difficult for you to create armor using these scales, right?&rdquo; asked Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not difficult,&rdquo; Chu Feng immediately began after answering. He used his world spirit techniques and turned their scales into armor.<br>As the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast was enormous, a single scale should be sufficient to create a set of armor.<br>However, they&rsquo;d picked up four scales.<br>Neither Fumo Shaoyu or Fumo Xin&rsquo;er wanted the remaining scale. Thus, it ended up in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands.<br>He cautiously placed the remaining scale into his Cosmos Sack. He had decided to store the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast&rsquo;s scale.<br>Although he could not use it to train, it was a rare item. Even if he were to only keep it as a commemorative object, it would still be meaningful.<br>After everything was prepared, Chu Feng, Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er all wrote a letter of farewell to the old granny.<br>Then, they set off on their journey...<br>At the beginning, everything went smoothly.<br>Through the Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formation, they soon left the Heaven-devouring Realm and began to proceed directly for the Immortal-bestowment Upper Realm.<br>However, as soon as they entered the teleportation formation, their armor manufactured with the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast&rsquo;s scales began to suffer wear and tear.<br>Furthermore, the spirit formation they gained after consuming a Flame Fruit was about to lose its effect too. They would need to consume a new Flame Fruit in order to maintain the spirit formation.<br>As the spirit formation could not be copied, they were unable to maintain the spirit formation in their bodies for long. Moreover, the number of Flame Fruits they had were limited.<br>As their armor became seriously worn and the spirit formation of the Flame Fruits gradually faded away, the tunnel that connected to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formation became very unstable.<br>It seemed like the teleportation tunnel would collapse at any moment.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve clearly left the Heaven-devouring Realm already. Why would things still be like this?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had a deep frown on his face. He could not understand why things were occuring this way.<br>Shouldn&rsquo;t it be that as long as they left the Heaven-devouring Realm, they would&rsquo;ve escaped from the sealing formation, and things would&rsquo;ve returned to normal?<br>However, the situation at hand clearly showed that things were not as simple as he had anticipated.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, is there something wrong?&rdquo; asked Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know why this is happening.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since we&rsquo;ve already left the Heaven-devouring Realm, we shouldn&rsquo;t be under the restriction of the spirit formation sealing it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, from the way things appear, we haven&rsquo;t been able to break free from that restriction.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If this is to continue, this spirit formation tunnel could very well collapse, and we will be drawn into a space-time vortex.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Entering a space-time vortex would be very dangerous,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Could it be because we&rsquo;re still wearing the scale armor?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could the armor be affecting us?&rdquo; asked Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s possible. However, I can&rsquo;t be certain,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s simple. Since we&rsquo;ve already left the Heaven-devouring Realm, these things are useless now. We&rsquo;ll just take them off.&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er thought that the abnormality was caused by the armor they were wearing. Thus, as she spoke, she began to remove it.<br>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng immediately shouted for her to stop.<br>Unfortunately, he was too late. Fumo Xin&rsquo;er had removed her armor.<br>The instant Fumo Xin&rsquo;er removed her armor, she was engulfed by a space-time vortex. Just like that, she disappeared before Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, what are we to do?&rdquo;<br>Seeing his own sister being sucked into a space-time vortex, Fumo Shaoyu immediately started panicking.<br>&ldquo;Remove your armor. Otherwise, we won&rsquo;t be able to find your little sister.&rdquo;<br>As the three of them were together, Chu Feng knew that the only reason why Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was sucked into a space-time vortex whereas both him and Fumo Shaoyu were fine was because she had removed her scale armor.<br>Even though they had left the Heaven-devouring Realm, the intangible spirit formation&rsquo;s power was still affecting them.<br>As such, for the sake of finding Fumo Xin&rsquo;er, Chu Feng removed his own armor as he told Fumo Shaoyu to remove his.<br>Immediately afterward, Fumo Shaoyu also removed his armor.<br>Sure enough, once they removed their armor, Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu were also sucked into a space-time vortex.<br>When the surroundings returned to normal, Chu Feng found himself outside of the spirit formation tunnel, and inside a vast mountain.<br>Even though he had no idea where this place was, he felt that this was most definitely not the Immortal-bestowment Upper Realm.<br>The reason for that was because they had left the spirit formation tunnel on their way to the Immortal-bestowment Upper Realm.<br>The fracture of a spirit formation tunnel mid teleportation and entering a space-time vortex was a very dangerous thing.<br>They were already enormously fortunate to be safe.<br>As such, Chu Feng did not have extravagant hopes that he had reached the Immortal-bestowment Upper Realm.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, brother Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>Shouts sounded from afar. That was Fumo Shaoyu&rsquo;s voice.<br>Looking over, Chu Feng soon saw Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, my sister&hellip; she doesn't seem to be here,&rdquo; Fumo Shaoyu said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Spirit formation tunnels pass through the vast starry sky with extreme speed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though your sister was sucked into a space-time vortex right before us, she must&rsquo;ve landed at a very great distance from us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, at the very least, we should be in the same world. Let us think of a way to find her. We should be able to find her,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;But, I have a tracking talisman for my sister.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re in the same world, the tracking talisman should be reacting.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, my tracking talisman is not reacting.&rdquo;<br>As Fumo Shaoyu spoke, he took out an amulet-like object.<br>That object not only had Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s aura, but it also had many powerful runes and symbols.<br>Just from a single glance, Chu Feng knew that it was a very powerful tracking talisman.<br>Such a powerful tracking talisman should be able to detect Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s location.<br>But, that tracking talisman was not reacting at all.<br></p></div>
