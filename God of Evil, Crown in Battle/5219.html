        <h1>Chapter 5219</h1>
        <div>: My Master is the World Spiritist Emperor<br>&ldquo;Why did your master choose to impart the Godsoul to me instead of anyone else? Your master should have more than one world spirit, right?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course! My master chose to impart the Godsoul to an outsider simply because he was too strong. I said earlier that there are Nine Great Godsouls in the world, each nurtured by a galaxy. Back then, my master obtained eight of the Nine Great Godsouls,&rdquo; Taowu said.<br>&ldquo;Your master had eight of the Godsouls?&rdquo;<br>Eggy revealed a rare shocked look.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Taowu replied gleefully.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s incredible,&rdquo; Eggy replied in awe.<br>The Ancient Era was known to be extremely chaotic. Those living in the era likely knew what the Godsoul was, so they were bound to put their lives on the line to acquire it. The fact that Taowu&rsquo;s master managed to acquire eight of them showed just how overwhelmingly powerful he was.<br>At the very least, few world spiritists would be able to match him.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of your master?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;My master&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Taowu suddenly looked at Eggy with a deep smile.<br>&ldquo;Were you the one who imparted the Pulse Searching Method to Chu Feng?&rdquo; Taowu asked.<br>Taowu had already known that Chu Feng had grasped the Pulse Searching Method from the moment the latter used the Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>&ldquo;You know the Pulse Searching Method?&rdquo; Eggy asked in shock.<br>&ldquo;Judging from your expression, it must have come from you. Where did you learn the Pulse Searching Method from? Is it from Great Beauty Chi Yu?&rdquo; Taowu asked with a smile.<br>&ldquo;You know Lord Chi Yu?&rdquo;<br>Eggy&rsquo;s astonishment deepened.<br>&ldquo;Heck! It really is the case.&rdquo;<br>In truth, Taowu was only making a blind guess and didn&rsquo;t bear much hope for it, but who could have thought that he actually got it right? His eyes lit up in excitement.<br>&ldquo;This is really a goddamned coincidence!&rdquo; Taowu exclaimed joyously.<br>&ldquo;Could it be&hellip;the world spiritist whom Lord Chi Yu served before is&hellip;&rdquo;<br>An unbelievable thought suddenly occurred to Eggy.<br>Her Pulse Searching Method had come from Lord Chi Yu, an incredibly powerful being in the Asura Spirit World. She knew that Lord Chi Yu had once served a world spiritist in the world of cultivation, although she later chose to permanently reside in the Asura Spirit World and eventually reached a frightening cultivation level.<br>Nevertheless, Lord Chi Yu had a high evaluation of the world spiritist whom she had served back then, claiming that he was an amazing world spiritist. She said that the Pulse Searching Method was created by that world spiritist.<br>&ldquo;You got that right. Great Beauty Chi Yu once served master together with me. It&rsquo;s just that she had to stay in the Asura Spirit World later on due to some matters, so she broke off her contract with my master. That became a huge regret for us brothers,&rdquo; Taowu said with a gloomy face.<br>&ldquo;What is there to regret? Don&rsquo;t tell me that you lust over Lord Chi Yu&rsquo;s beauty?&rdquo; Eggy asked with a mischievous smile.<br>Lord Chi Yu was already advanced in age when she was born, but she had consumed a spiritual medicine that kept her in her most beautiful state no matter how old she became. She didn&rsquo;t have to maintain her appearance or resort to disguise, for that was how she really looked.<br>There were many people who had a crush on her and saw her as their goddess&hellip; though they could only keep their feelings to themselves. Few people dared to court her, for she was extremely strong as well.<br>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s that too, but more because all of us were still young back then. None of us was Great Beauty Chi Yu&rsquo;s match. Just think about it&mdash;the strongest world spirit of the strongest world spiritist is a woman! How could we possibly accept that?<br>&ldquo;My brothers and I did become much stronger afterward, but Great Beauty Chi Yu was no longer in the world of cultivation by then. We couldn&rsquo;t challenge her to a fight anymore. That&rsquo;s what I regret the most,&rdquo; Taowu said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d be best to keep it at that. Elder, it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m looking down on you. I know that you&rsquo;re very powerful, but you don&rsquo;t stand a chance against Lord Chi Yu,&rdquo; Eggy said firmly.<br>She could say that with absolute confidence because she had witnessed Lord Chi Yu&rsquo;s strength before.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that I would win. I just wanted to challenge her.&rdquo;<br>Taowu was a proud individual, but he didn&rsquo;t refute Eggy&rsquo;s statement. He, too, knew how formidable Chi Yu was.<br>In the limited time they had spent together, that beautiful but cold woman felt like a colossal mountain that he would never be able to overcome no matter how hard he worked in his lifetime.<br>&ldquo;Oh right! Elder, you said that your master is the strongest world spiritist in the Ancient Era. What was his name?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>She was even more curious about it after learning that Taowu was acquainted with Lord Chi Yu, and they had both served under the same master.<br>&ldquo;Great Beauty Chi Yu never told you who our master is?&rdquo; Taowu asked in surprise.<br>&ldquo;She refused to talk about it. She only told us that he&rsquo;s a formidable world spiritist,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;Really, what&rsquo;s there to hide about that? Forget it, allow me to tell you in her place. Our master was the one deemed to be the strongest world spiritist back in that era. He developed countless formations and means, and he has countless world spiritist treasures in his possession. Through his extreme mastery of world spiritist techniques, he rose to the top in the world of cultivation and was dubbed as the only emperor amongst the world spiritists.<br>&ldquo;The world respectfully addresses him as the World Spiritist Emperor.<br>&ldquo;However, my master doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge that title, even going to the extent of forbidding us from calling him that. He prefers to use his real name instead. He&rsquo;s from the Qin Clan, and he happens to be the ninth one to be born in his family. Guess what&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; Taowu asked with a cheeky look on his face.<br>&ldquo;Could it be Qin Jiu?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>(Jiu means nine)<br>&ldquo;Indeed, it&rsquo;s Qin Jiu.&rdquo;<br>Taowu nodded his head vigorously as a chuckle slipped out of his mouth.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s really a casual name.&rdquo;<br>Eggy couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh as well. It was indeed peculiar for someone so powerful that he was dubbed the World Spiritist<br>to be named so carelessly.<br>&ldquo;My master doesn&rsquo;t mind it though. He says that he&rsquo;ll respect the name his parents gave him, and he&rsquo;ll use it till the day he dies. Speaking of which, I saw a shadow of my master in young brother Chu Feng when he deciphered the formation earlier. There&rsquo;s a chance that he might have inherited the legacy of my master&rsquo;s inheritor,&rdquo; Taowu said.<br>&ldquo;Are you referring to the formation deciphering method earlier? He acquired it from the Yue Clan&rsquo;s ancestral land. Could it be possible that the Yue Clan&rsquo;s legacy descended from Lord Qin Jiu, just that the ancestors of the Yue Clan were limited in their intelligence and could only grasp the superficial layer of it?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s definitely possible. My master believes in making the world a better place, so he likes to leave legacies around. He created various trials to disseminate the Pulse Searching Method back then too. It&rsquo;s just a pity that very few are able to grasp his skills.<br>&ldquo;While Chu Feng has barely grasped the basics of my master&rsquo;s legacy, it&rsquo;s already a fairly formidable feat. Not to mention, his cultivation is still weak at the moment and he hasn&rsquo;t fully awakened his world spiritist bloodline yet. I have no doubt that he&rsquo;ll be able to master the Pulse Searching Method once his world spiritist bloodline fully awakens,&rdquo; Taowu said.<br>&ldquo;Is Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spiritist bloodline formidable?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;It is very formidable. What he displayed earlier was incomplete, but my guess is that it might be the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline,&rdquo; Taowu replied.<br>&ldquo;Is the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline formidable?&rdquo; Eggy asked on.<br>&ldquo;Formidable? It is the strongest world spiritist bloodline! Even my master doesn&rsquo;t have that bloodline even though he was the strongest world spiritist back in my era. That being said, bloodline is only an aspect of a person&rsquo;s talent. It&rsquo;s no guarantee that one will eventually rise to become the strongest. My master is the perfect example of that.<br>&ldquo;That being said, as long as young brother Chu Feng is able to successfully awaken the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline, he&rsquo;ll definitely rise to great heights in the future,&rdquo; Taowu said.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know Chu Feng was this formidable. It&rsquo;s no wonder you said that I&rsquo;m unworthy of him.&rdquo;<br>Eggy could hardly conceal her smile. She was happy for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it. When I said that you aren&rsquo;t worthy of him, I&rsquo;m not talking about your talent. What I was saying is that his character is much better than yours,&rdquo; Taowu snickered.<br>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;<br>Eggy rolled her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Alright, my mission is finally accomplished. I&rsquo;m going to head out and look for my master now.&rdquo;<br>Taowu could hardly wait to meet his master once more.<br>However, Eggy&rsquo;s expression turned heavy.<br>&ldquo;Elder, do you know where your master currently is?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;I do. My master told me where I should look for him after I passed the Godsoul on to the fated one,&rdquo; Taowu replied.<br>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a secret,&rdquo; Taowu replied mischievously.<br>&ldquo;Elder, did you hibernate in the most prosperous age of the Ancient Era?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it is the most prosperous age of the Ancient Era, but my master was definitely at his peak then. Why do you ask that?&rdquo; Taowu replied.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just asking out of curiosity. Elder, are you able to sense Lord Qin Jiu now?&rdquo; Eggy asked once more.<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sense him. What&rsquo;s wrong, lass? Why are you asking so many questions?&rdquo; Taowu replied.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just worried that you might not be able to find Lord Qin Jiu,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll definitely be able to find him,&rdquo; Taowu replied confidently.<br>Words looked to be at the tip of Eggy&rsquo;s tongue, but she eventually held herself back and instead said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wish you the best of luck in finding Lord Qin Jiu then.&rdquo;<br>She had wanted to tell him that something seemed to have occurred in the later years of the Ancient Era, and that Lord Qin Jiu might no longer be around anymore. But again, there were many existences from the Ancient Era who were still alive in the present era. Considering how powerful Lord Qin Jiu was, there was a good chance that he was still alive.<br>What she knew about the Ancient Era was mainly speculation, so she chose not to share her dubious knowledge with Taowu.<br>&ldquo;Lass, about your inability to fuse with the Godsoul, there are two reasons behind that. One, you still aren&rsquo;t strong enough. Two, you need your master to help you in the process, but Chu Feng isn&rsquo;t strong enough either.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be too worried about it though. You&rsquo;ll be able to tap into its powers once the time is ripe. However, you shouldn&rsquo;t expect to harness the entirety of its energy. I had spent many years cultivating it back then, but even up to the moment right before I separated with it, I was only able to draw a small portion of its power.<br>&ldquo;That being said, you can be certain that the Godsoul is nothing but beneficial to your future. It will be exhilarating,&rdquo; Taowu said.<br>&ldquo;How strong do I have to be before I can tap into its powers?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>She wanted to grow stronger as fast as possible so that she could help and protect Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a rule for that. You&rsquo;ll feel it once you&rsquo;re ready. Since you&rsquo;re that curious, I&rsquo;ll give you one more clue. Back then, I obtained the power when I reached mid True God level,&rdquo; Taowu replied.<br>&ldquo;Mid True God level? There&rsquo;s still a long way to go before I reach that level.&rdquo;<br>Mid True God level seemed too far away from Eggy, who was still at Martial Exalted level.<br>&ldquo;It differs from person to person. It might be faster for you considering your talents. You haven&rsquo;t fully awakened your bloodline, right? Who knows? You might just succeed at early True God level.<br>&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s end the conversation here. I&rsquo;ve already been here for far too long, and I really want to meet my master now.<br>&ldquo;Oh right! I&rsquo;m only telling you these because you&rsquo;re acquainted with Great Beauty Chi Yu, but make sure you don&rsquo;t tell Chu Feng my true identity. Keep everything I told you about my master a secret from him too. Just tell him that I&rsquo;ve gone somewhere else, you hear me?&rdquo; Taowu reminded.<br>&ldquo;Why do you want to keep it a secret? It isn&rsquo;t a big deal,&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;I want to keep an air of mystery. I&rsquo;m certain that I&rsquo;ll meet young brother Chu Feng once more at the peak of the world of cultivation. I want him to think of me as an elder he randomly met along the way instead of an elder from the Ancient Era whom he needs to revere,&rdquo; Taowu said.<br>&ldquo;All right, elder. You can trust me on that,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll at least send the two of you on your way lest you be assaulted by others.&rdquo;<br>As Taowu spoke, he waved his sleeves. Their surroundings instantaneously changed.<br>They had been teleported out of the hall to a safe forest far away from the demon coffin, though they were still in the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm. At the same time, Chu Feng, who was in a severely weakened state earlier, began recovering from his depletion.<br>&ldquo;Lass, I&rsquo;ll be going off now. Send my well wishes to Great Beauty Chi Yu!&rdquo;<br>With those words,Taowu rose into the air and flew away. His movements were so fast that it only took the blink of an eye for him to reach the vast cosmos outside the realm. He appeared to be walking at a leisurely pace, but every step he took covered a mind-bogglingly large distance. Stars and realms seemed to flash past him amidst his casual walk.<br>Taowu had a clear destination in mind, and that was the brightest galaxy in the vast cosmos&mdash;the Ninth Galaxy.<br>It was rumored that the Ninth Galaxy contained secrets of the Immemorial Era, which gave rise to its name as the Immemorial Domain of Gods, though some also knew it as the Immemorial Purgatory.<br>&hellip;<br>Chu Feng regained consciousness shortly after Taowu left.<br>&ldquo;How are you feeling, Chu Feng?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>She wasn&rsquo;t worried about Chu Feng since Taowu had already healed him.<br>Perplexed by his foreign environment, Chu Feng asked, &ldquo;Where are we, Eggy? Where is Elder Tao Wu?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He has left,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;Left? Where to?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was worried about Tao Wu. The latter was severely injured earlier on when he saved him from the formation.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s looking for his master,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;Master? Elder Tao Wu has a master?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was surprised.<br>&ldquo;Of course. He&rsquo;s a world spirit,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;World spirit?&rdquo;<br>That deepened Chu Feng&rsquo;s astonishment.<br>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t just any world spirit. He&rsquo;s none other than the evil spirit who was sealed in the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm.&rdquo;<br>Taowu would have slapped the living daylights out of Eggy if he heard those words. He thought that Eggy would hold her promise to keep his identity a secret, but little did he know that Eggy was not someone to be trusted.<br></div>
