        <h1>Chapter 4173</h1>
        <div> - Changing Position<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A massive army composed of hundreds of thousands of people flew out of the eighteen flying war chariots. The experts of the Dragon Clan were all holding weapons as they surrounded Long Xiao and his grandfather.<br>The Dragon Clan had a robust foundation.<br>Even if their clansmen lacked strength, they had the backing of their clan.<br>Thus, even if their opponents were stronger than them, they would still dare to draw their weapons to confront their opponents.<br>Confronted with the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s army that surrounded them, Long Xiao burst into loud laughter.<br>It was a sneering laugh.<br>&ldquo;I truly never would&rsquo;ve imagined my Dragon Clansmen to one day dare aim their weapons at me,&rdquo; Long Xiao spoke again.<br>His voice was still a female&rsquo;s voice.<br>It was sweet and pleasant-sounding. It was a rare sort of voice.<br>But, Long Xiao was clearly a man. Why would he be speaking with a woman&rsquo;s voice?<br>Moreover, he had been whipped so much earlier that his flesh had been completely mutilated. Thus, why was he suddenly completely uninjured? Not only did his body recover, even his clothing had been restored.<br>There was also that old man, Long Xiao&rsquo;s grandfather; he was emitting the power of a ruler.<br>Exactly what was going on?<br>Exactly who was the grandfather-grandson pair?<br>Just when the crowd were feeling most confused, Long Xiao&rsquo;s appearance began to change.<br>Soon, from a youth, Long Xiao turned into a young woman.<br>Furthermore, it was a very beautiful young woman.<br>Her beauty was different from Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s beauty.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was like a celestial fairy. She had an incomparably noble sort of beauty.<br>As for this girl, while she also gave off an impressive air, she appeared more quick-witted, charming, and filled with youthful vigor.<br>It was not only Long Xiao&rsquo;s appearance that had changed. Her clothes had also changed. Her tattered clothing had been replaced by a noble golden gown.<br>Furthermore, Long Xiao was not the only person that underwent a transformation. Long Xiao&rsquo;s grandfather had also transformed.<br>Although his sex did not change, his body became enormously large.<br>His body continued to grow. In the end, he became a robust man that was over five meters tall.<br>As his appearance changed, his eyes also turned sharp.<br>Those sharp eyes simply did not seem to be something that humans should possess. Instead, they looked like the eyes of a hawk.<br>Furthermore, he was also wearing a noble golden gown.<br>Chu Feng was stunned by the transformations.<br>Evidently, Long Xiao and his grandfather were not as simple as he had imagined them to be.<br>The two of them most definitely possessed extraordinary identities.<br>Compared to Chu Feng&rsquo;s shock, the people from the Dragon Clan were totally terrified.<br>It was impossible for them to not recognize the two people before them.<br>The old man was one of their Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elders, Long Shengbu.<br>As for the young woman, she was even more remarkable. She was the daughter of their Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, one of their Dragon Clan&rsquo;s princesses, Her Highness Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to Lord Supreme Elder!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to Your Highness!&rdquo;<br>The Dragon Clansmen that had drawn their weapons, all knelt in midair.<br>Even Lord Tonghe knelt like the rest of the Dragon Clansmen.<br>Seeing that, the people from the Nine Principles Dragon Sect turned pale with fear. They were scared witless. After kneeling, they began to shiver, and cold sweat dripped down from their bodies like rain. Even breathing became difficult for them.<br>They were so terrified that they were on the verge of dying from fear.<br>No matter what, they had never imagined that the two people that they had not placed in their eyes at all earlier, would be such noble existences within the Dragon Clan.<br>&ldquo;Supreme Elder?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your Highness?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was also very surprised upon learning the two people&rsquo;s identities.<br>&ldquo;Thus, everything had been done deliberately?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The strange tornado in the Endless Abyss had also been caused by them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They deliberately separated me from Senior Long so that I would run into them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Then, they sent another tornado to bring him to my rescue?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But why? Why did they do that?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had come to a realization of what had happened.<br>Long Xiao and Long Shengbu had never existed. Even Long Xiao&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s illness was most definitely fake.<br>In fact, it was even very possible that the Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone had been deliberately placed there by them.<br>All of it had been planned by them.<br>But, Chu Feng was unable to understand what their motive was.<br>He was clearly an outsider, and not someone from the Dragon Clan. Even if they wanted to test someone, they shouldn&rsquo;t be testing him.<br>Of course, Chu Feng had no idea that he had coincidentally been seen by the two grand existences from the Dragon Clan when he had fought against the geniuses from the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan in the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>Ever since then, the two grand existences of the Dragon Clan had become interested in him.<br>&ldquo;Tonghe, you truly have some nerve. You dared whip me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for Grandpa Bu using his power to protect me, I would&rsquo;ve been whipped to death by you.&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao turned her gaze to Long Tonghe.<br>Her beautiful eyes contained killing intent.<br>&ldquo;Your Highness, this subordinate had no idea it was you. If I had known that it was you, even if I were given ten thousand times the nerve, this subordinate would still not dare to do that.&rdquo;<br>Lord Tonghe&rsquo;s aged body was trembling nonstop. Tears were present on his ugly face.<br>He looked like he was on the verge of pissing his pants out of fear.<br>In the crowd&rsquo;s hearts, Lord Tonghe had always been an aloof and remote existence standing far above them. He was someone akin to a god.<br>Because of that, Long Daozhi and the others were completely astounded by his sorry appearance.<br>They suddenly came to a realization.<br>It turned out that grand existences would only remain aloof and remote before minor non-entities.<br>When confronted with people more powerful and grander than themselves, those grand existences would be reduced to non-entities themselves. They would cower and become humble like ordinary people.<br>&ldquo;If you knew who I was, how could you expose your true self?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao sneered.<br>&ldquo;Long Tonghe, you colluded with the Nine Principles Dragon Sect and accepted their benefits in return for partiality toward them! Do you plead guilty?!&rdquo;<br>A furious shout was suddenly heard. Spatial cracks appeared from the vibration caused by the voice.<br>It was the Supreme Elder Long Shengbu!<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, this subordinate pleads guilty, this subordinate pleads guilty.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This subordinate does not dare to refute it. It&rsquo;s just that Lord Supreme Elder and Your Highness, please take into consideration that this subordinate has served the Dragon Clan for many years and spare my life. Please give me an opportunity to make amends for my mistakes,&rdquo; Long Tonghe did not dare to refute them, and began to beg for forgiveness.<br>&ldquo;Served the Dragon Clan? More like you&rsquo;ve utilized your status as a member of our Dragon Clan to seek personal benefits, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Nine Principles Dragon Sect is merely one of many. The amount of benefits you&rsquo;ve obtained from others are simply innumerable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In fact, you even dared to covet the possessions of our Dragon Clan,&rdquo; said Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Your Highness, I wouldn&rsquo;t dare. How could I dare covet the possessions of our Dragon Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I only dare to accept what was given to me by the Dragon Clan. I have never dared to take anything that wasn&rsquo;t given to me,&rdquo; said Long Tonghe.<br>&ldquo;Never dared?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There were four Dragon Vein Source Stones in the Endless Abyss.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why is it that only one remained?&rdquo; asked Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Your Highness, that&rsquo;s because this bunch are simply too incompetent. They failed to find the remaining three Dragon Vein Source Stones within the allocated time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once the time limit for the Endless Abyss&rsquo;s spirit formation arrives, it will transport all the treasures inside. Thus, the three remaining Dragon Vein Source Stones were teleported elsewhere. As for where they are now, this subordinate has no idea,&rdquo; said Long Tonghe.<br>&ldquo;You dare to still lie? Grandpa Bu and I were inside the Endless Abyss the entire time. How could we not know exactly what was going on?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Grandpa Bu, help him take out his evidence,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao looked to the Supreme Elder standing next to her.<br></p></div>
