        <h1>Chapter 4268</h1>
        <div> - The Master Arrival?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For the sake of obtaining the inheritance of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain, the crowd were acting unscrupulously.<br>Even those people that knew they had no chance were trying out their luck and sending voice transmissions to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;All of you, shut up!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a furious shout exploded in the sky. Then, boundless oppressive might covered the region.<br>It was the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.<br>Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted furious shout was filled with a threatening nature. Hearing that, many people began to panic.<br>They all knew that the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted was a vicious and merciless individual. Who knows what sort of thing he might do.<br>That said, not everyone present was afraid of the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted. For example, there&rsquo;s Grandmaster Luo Tuo.<br>&ldquo;Ghost-face, what are you implying?&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Luo Tuo stared at the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted. Displeasure filled his eyes.<br>He seemed to be telling Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted with his eyes that he&rsquo;d best not make an enemy out of him. If he tried to fight him head-on, he would definitely pit himself against him too.<br>Earlier, the two of them joined hands against Grandmaster Tang Chen because of Chu Feng.<br>But, in a blink of an eye, they&rsquo;ve turned hostile toward one another.<br>Furthermore, it was also because of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Seeing Grandmaster Luo Tuo acting like this, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted snorted coldly.<br>But, he did not argue with Grandmaster Luo Tuo. Instead, he turned his gaze to the rest of the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, no matter what, you&rsquo;re all people with some status.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, what you all are doing is trying to catch a snow wolf empty-handed, an insult to your reputations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, who is young friend Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He is a world spiritist genius that has never appeared in the history of our Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To intend on becoming his master, everyone, shouldn&rsquo;t you consider your own abilities first?&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted looked to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, among the people present, only five are qualified to become your master. They&rsquo;re Grandmaster Tang Chen, Grandmaster Luo Tuo, Celestial Fairy Muzhi, Old Man Compliance and myself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, the five of us are not all equal either. I am not tooting my own horn but if we are to really fight, I, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted, am most definitely stronger than them.&rdquo;<br>Immediately after hearing those words, Grandmaster Luo Tuo cursed out loud, &ldquo;Ghost-face, you&rsquo;re truly one to blow your own trumpet. You, superior to us? Come, let us fight then.&rdquo;<br>To the crowd&rsquo;s surprise, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted decided to ignore Grandmaster Luo Tuo.<br>He continued to speak to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, there are some misunderstandings between us earlier. But, as the saying goes, no discord, no concord.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am truly appreciative of your talent. I am not coveting your inheritance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I dare vow here that if I am to obtain that inheritance, I will immediately impart it to you,&rdquo; said Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Who would believe someone like you?&rdquo; sneered Celestial Fairy Muzhi.<br>&ldquo;A treacherous vile character. You&rsquo;ve said all that because you wanted that inheritance. Young friend Chu Feng, do not trust him. That Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted is a truly treacherous fellow. He&rsquo;s a vile and nasty man from head to toe.&rdquo;<br>Even the shameless Grandmaster Luo Tuo was making cutting remarks about Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a scream was heard. It came from the Revered Master Beast Tamer.<br>Revered Master Beast Tamer who had been hiding behind Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted the entire time suddenly had his throat grabbed by none other than the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, this is a show of my sincerity.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted clenched his hands. &ldquo;Puchi,&rdquo; blood splattered everywhere as the Revered Master Beast Tamer was reduced into a puddle of blood.<br>&ldquo;Master!!!&rdquo;<br>Seeing his master being killed, Li Fengxue snarled with grief and indignation.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted raised his hand and sent forth a backhanded slap toward Li Fengxue. Bang! Li Fengxue, like his master, was reduced to a puddle of blood.<br>The crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed upon seeing this scene.<br>In the Holy Light Galaxy, that Revered Master Beast Tamer was most definitely a top-rated world spiritist.<br>He was someone backed by some major powers too.<br>Yet, he was killed just like that. Most importantly, the person that killed him was someone that he possessed a friendship with, the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.<br>This made the crowd once again realize how cruel the martial cultivation world was.<br>In this world, truly few people cared about friendship and camaraderie.<br>Before absolute self-interest, the majority of the crowd would abandon the so-called friendship and camaraderie.<br>The behavior of the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted perfectly illustrated what cold and ruthlessness was.<br>&ldquo;Beast Tamer was a close friend of mine. But, since he plotted against young friend Chu Feng, his behavior was that of a vile man of nasty character.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To dare attempt to strangle the lightbearer of our Holy Light Galaxy, even though he&rsquo;s my close friend, I will still not forgive him.&rdquo;<br>Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted did not care about the crowd&rsquo;s criticisms and, in a manner inspiring righteousness and reverence, justified his actions.<br>He acted like he was truly someone who placed righteousness above his own personal connections.<br>But, the crowd all knew exactly what sort of person this Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted was.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing the hypocritical Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted, Chu Feng was unable to contain himself from laughing. His laughter was so very mocking.<br>&ldquo;Senior, there is no need for you to continue with this futile matter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, entered the path of martial cultivation for the sake of protecting those close to me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if they did something wrong, I will still protect them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While I am not someone that will commit bloody atrocities and outrageous acts, I am not a selfless individual either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My selfishness lies in the fact that I will only fight for those I care about. As for the life and death of others, I couldn't care less.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your earlier action was evidently in disagreement with my life&rsquo;s philosophy. As such, it is destined that there will be no relation between us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, I don&rsquo;t wish to become the next target for you to place righteousness above.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng spoke loudly. His ridiculing nature was fully evident in his voice.<br>But, Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted was actually not angered by Chu Feng&rsquo;s ridicule. Instead, with a smile on his face, he said, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you can most definitely trust my moral character. What happened between us was a misunderstanding. If you are willing to spend more time getting to know me, you will discover that we are most definitely fellow-minded people.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ghost-face, you should just shut up. Someone as treacherous and nasty as you is simply not qualified to become young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s master,&ldquo; cursed Grandmaster Luo Tuo.<br>Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted was finally unable to ignore him anymore and argued back.<br>Even Celestial Fairy Muzhi joined the argument.<br>At this moment, these grand characters were publicly insulting and slandering one another. Their behavior was truly inconsistent with their grand status.<br>But, it just so happened that very few people dared to laugh at them.<br>After all, there were a lot of people acting as shameless as them.<br>For the sake of becoming Chu Feng&rsquo;s master, for the sake of obtaining the inheritance, they were all acting unscrupulously.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, there&rsquo;s no need to continue with your futile efforts. Chu Feng&hellip; already have a master.&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, a voice exploded from afar.<br>That voice was so deep and resounding that it caught everyone&rsquo;s attention.<br>Looking toward the voice, the crowd were all surprised.<br>They simply do not recognize that person at all.<br>But, after seeing that person, Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s expression changed. A smile appeared on his face.<br>As for Chu Feng, he was ecstatic upon seeing this person.<br>The person that appeared before the crowd was someone extremely ugly.<br>But, this person was someone he knew.<br>He was also the person Chu Feng wished to see the most.<br>This person&hellip; was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist!!!<br></p></div>
