        <h1>Chapter 5572: Jie Tian’s Final Hand</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;You&hellip; aren&rsquo;t a formation entity?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Putting aside Jie Tian, even the emaciated elder and the other traitors were taken aback too. They were certain that Chu Feng was a formation entity, so how could he suddenly not be one?</span><br><span>In response, Chu Feng released his spirit power, which was distinctly different from that of the formation entities. At this point, the crowd had no other choice but to believe him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How did you get here? You didn&rsquo;t clear the trial!&rdquo; the emaciated elder exclaimed.</span><br><span>Non-natives of the Star Sea Realm had to clear the trial if they wanted to enter this place, but Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t even enter the trial ground.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Jie Tian roared.</span><br><span>The emaciated elder quickly shut his mouth.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not important. None of this is important,&rdquo; Jie Tian said with a terrible expression on his face before bursting into laughter. He glared at Chu Feng with murderous eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how you slipped in here or what your motive is. I don&rsquo;t even care who you are. I only want you dead.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Cracks began appearing on Jie Tian&rsquo;s formation armor.</span><br><span>Bam!</span><br><span>The formation armor suddenly shattered apart, but shockingly, there was not a sliver of spirit power to be found in the shattered formation armor. It was nothing but an empty shell.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes narrowed.</span><br><span>To his surprise, Jie Tian was unharmed beneath his formation armor. This wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be the case as Chu Feng had specifically aimed the attack to hurt Jie Tian. On top of that, Jie Tian was shrouded in a thick black aura.</span><br><span>Chu Feng had no idea how Jie Tian dodged the earlier attack, but he did know where the black aura had come from.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You absorbed the formation armor&rsquo;s energy into your body? You know that your body won&rsquo;t be able to harness the energy for long without the formation armor&rsquo;s support? At most&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng flicked his middle finger at Jie Tian. &ldquo;&hellip; you&rsquo;ll only last an incense stick&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than enough to deal with you!&rdquo; Jie Tian roared before opening his arms wide.</span><br><span>The black aura suddenly gushed outward in a circle, exerting a powerful force that doubled as an offensive and defensive means.</span><br><span>The eighteen formation armors were sent flying by the formation.</span><br><span>Little Fishy took a step forward, but Chu Feng stopped her with a raise of his hand, indicating that there was no need for her to step in. Initially, Little Fishy was still worried about him, but her worry quickly dissipated.</span><br><span>The eighteen formation armors twisted their bodies in the air to neutralize the force of the earlier attack before charging at Jie Tian once more with their weapons in hand.</span><br><span>Jie Tian was ready for their counterattack, as he manifested formation swords in each of his hands. These weren&rsquo;t ordinary formation swords; they released powerful surges of spirit power each time they were swung.</span><br><span>He was able to stand his ground against the eighteen formation armors thanks to his incredible prowess as a world spiritist, but that was all he could do with his current strength. He couldn&rsquo;t find a chance to approach Chu Feng at all.</span><br><span>Nevertheless, Jie Tian burst into laughter and said, &ldquo;Come, </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>. I&rsquo;ll face the two of you together. I, Jie Tian, am not scared of you!&rdquo;</span><br><span>He was so arrogant that he looked no different from a madman, but he did have the right to behave in such a manner. Now that he was no longer restricted by the formation armor, he was able to better control his spirit power, resulting in a significant rise in his fighting prowess.</span><br><span>Under normal circumstances, it would have been hard for Chu Feng and Little Fishy to subdue Jie Tian even if the two of them joined hands&hellip; but now, Jie Tian was struggling to even deal with Chu Feng alone.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Little Fishy, just stand there and watch. I can deal with him myself,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>Jie Tian was displeased to hear that. He couldn&rsquo;t stand the sight of Chu Feng acting smug in front of him, but to his ire, he was unable to breach the formation armors&rsquo; encirclement.</span><br><span>&ldquo;521&rsquo;s spirit power has become weaker compared to before, but why is he stronger now? Does he possess heaven-defying battle power, just like Jie Tian?&rdquo; the emaciated elder murmured.</span><br><span>Much to the crowd&rsquo;s astonishment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s ability to control the formation armors had become much more adept than before. Similar to how Jie Tian&rsquo;s fighting prowess had grown now that he was no longer restricted by the formation armor, Chu Feng had grown stronger too.</span><br><span>While the two of them were equally matched at the moment, Jie Tian&rsquo;s spirit power wouldn&rsquo;t last for long. In fact, Jie Tian might even fall in defeat within less than an incense stick&rsquo;s time.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do. We can&rsquo;t wait here like sitting ducks!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The emaciated elder looked at Chu Feng with a hint of killing intent in his eyes.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>A formation blade suddenly shot over and decimated the emaciated elder.</span><br><span>Chu Feng had noticed the emaciated elder&rsquo;s killing intent and ordered one of the formation armors to kill him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Anyone else wants to give it a try?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.</span><br><span>Who else would dare to intervene after watching the emaciated elder&rsquo;s instantaneous death? The traitors stood frozen on the spot, not daring to move at all.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahahaha&hellip; </span><span>Gahahahaha</span><span>!&rdquo; Jie Tian burst into laughter once more.</span><br><span>He stopped moving altogether even though he hadn&rsquo;t fully expended the power he had absorbed from the formation armor.</span><br><span>&ldquo;521, I won&rsquo;t bother retaliating anymore. Try and kill me if you dare. I&rsquo;d like to see if you can pull it off!&rdquo; Jie Tian sneered provocatively.</span><br><span>Without any hesitation, Chu Feng changed his hand seal, and one of the formation armors hacked its blade down upon Jie Tian. Before the blade could decapitate Jie Tian, it suddenly stalled to a halt.</span><br><span>An invisible layer of energy had stopped the blade.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>A bundle of black aura suddenly surged out of Jie Tian&rsquo;s body. It first enveloped the blade before quickly spreading to the formation armor holding onto the blade. It took seconds for the powerful formation armor to be reduced to cinders.</span><br><span>Chu Feng, Little Fishy, and the traitors were stunned. They could feel a ridiculously terrifying and powerful aura steadily flowing out of Jie Tian&rsquo;s body.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>Both the sky and the earth started shaking.</span><br><span>Countless starlight runes suddenly appeared out of thin air in the sky and swiftly gathered together, enveloping the sky. Without any warning, they rained down to the earth, but they eventually converged toward a single person&mdash;Jie Tian.</span><br><span>To be exact, it was the powerful black aura inside Jie Tian.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sealing power.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng could tell that the starlight runes were the Star Memorial Domain&rsquo;s sealing power. It was trying to seal off the black aura inside Jie Tian&rsquo;s body.</span><br></p></div>
