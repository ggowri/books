        <h1>Chapter 2602</h1>
        <div> - Confidence<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Genius, truly a genius. Chu Feng is most definitely a most exceptional genius that rarely appears in ten thousand years.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s more than just a genius. The way I see it, Chu Feng&rsquo;s future accomplishments will surpass even Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s. He will become the true overlord of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In fact, he might even overtake Grandmaster Kai Hong and Senior Zhan Haichuan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Indeed. If I didn&rsquo;t witness it myself, I truly would not dare believe that someone would be able to move about in such an unhindered manner in the Unknown Burial Ground. This is truly too astonishing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, we are unable to understand the world of geniuses.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, the crowd outside were all deeply awed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s actions.<br>The reason for that was because that Unknown Burial Ground was all of their nightmare. Yet, Chu Feng was able to move about unhindered in the Unknown Burial Ground.<br>Although the crowd did not believe that Chu Feng would be able to break through the Unknown Burial ground at the beginning, after they now saw that Chu Feng was defeating powerful spirit formations one after another, the crowd all felt that it would be possible for Chu Feng to break through the Unknown Burial Ground.<br>They all felt that Chu Feng might be able to escape from the Unknown Burial Ground using the methods he had comprehended.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that we were mistaken?&rdquo; At this moment, Ying Mingchao looked to Zi Xunyi. He had a complicated expression on his face.<br>At the beginning, he had felt the entire time that the method that they used, the decision to endure the slaughtering formations with their own bodies, was the most effective method and the only method.<br>Yet now, he became skeptical. He started to suspect that the method he and Zi Xunyi had used to break through the Unknown Burial Ground might not be the only method there was.<br>In fact, he felt that the method that they used was simply incorrect. He felt that they had only managed to escape the Unknown Burial Ground by pure coincidence.<br>The reason for that was because they did not really break through the Life and Death Formation. Instead, they were sent out of the Life and Death Formation after experiencing a series of trials and tribulations.<br>However, with what Chu Feng was doing, if he was to succeed, he would be able to completely break through the Life and Death Formation.<br>&ldquo;It is not that we are wrong. It can only be said that Chu Feng&rsquo;s method to destroy the various slaughtering formations is another way out.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, back then, we did not just escape the Unknown Burial Ground. We also obtained benefits from it,&rdquo; Zi Xunyi said.<br>&ldquo;Right. After all, that All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart was obtained from there.&rdquo;<br>After being reminded by Zi Xunyi, Ying Mingchao grew confident again.<br>The reason for that was because they were not sent back out of the Unknown Burial Ground after escaping from the Life and Death Formation.<br>Instead, they were teleported to a cave palace.<br>They obtained some treasures from within that cave palace.<br>Not only was the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart one of the treasures, but they also obtained treasures that could directly increase their cultivation.<br>Those treasures could be deemed as their rewards for successfully passing through the Life and Death Formation.<br>&ldquo;Look! Chu Feng is about to succeed!&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, the crowd burst into an uproar again.<br>After hearing the crowd&rsquo;s voices of excitement, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi noticed that Chu Feng was currently breaking through a very powerful grand formation.<br>This grand formation was composed of six different types of gaseous flames.<br>Wind gaseous flames.<br>Lightning gaseous flames.<br>Water gaseous flames.<br>Fire gaseous flames.<br>Earth gaseous flames.<br>And the final type, a black gaseous flame.<br>It was unknown what sort of power this black gaseous flames contained. However, it was the most powerful of the six types of gaseous flames.<br>The six different gaseous flames were gathered together. They formed an extremely destructive slaughtering formation. Even for Chu Feng, it was very difficult to destroy this slaughtering formation.<br>However, the power of the six gaseous flames was growing weaker and fainter. Evidently&hellip; Chu Feng was about to succeed.<br>&ldquo;That slaughtering formation is extremely difficult to breach. I wonder, will there be even more difficult formations after that one?&rdquo; Zi Xunyi said.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. That slaughtering formation seems to be the last formation in the Life and Death Formation,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; Zi Xunyi asked in a very astonished manner.<br>&ldquo;That is something that I comprehended from that illusion. Originally, I thought that the things from the illusion were all false.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, looking at it now, the things that we&rsquo;ve comprehended from the illusion were not all false.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Else, Chu Feng would not have been able to reach this far,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, then it would be truly great.&rdquo;<br>Zi Xunyi felt extremely joyous. Although she had also experienced the Unknown Burial Ground, the things that one could comprehend from that illusion were all personal and different from one another.<br>For example, there were many things that Ying Mingchao managed to comprehend that Zi Xunyi did not.<br>Thus, Zi Xunyi was very trusting of Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s words.<br>Most importantly, this Unknown Burial Ground was simply too dangerous. As long as Chu Feng was still in there, she would still be worried.<br>Thus, Zi Xunyi deeply hoped that Chu Feng would be able to break through the Life and Death Formation as quickly as possible.<br>&ldquo;Those hand seals?&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, Zi Xunyi&rsquo;s gaze changed. She revealed a panicky expression.<br>&ldquo;Xunyi, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Ying Mingchao noticed the abnormal reaction that Zi Xunyi had.<br>Although Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s battle power surpassed Zi Xunyi&rsquo;s, and his talent for martial cultivation was also slightly better than hers, he was inferior to Zi Xunyi in terms of world spirit techniques.<br>Right now, what Chu Feng was using was his world spirit techniques. As such, he was unable to determine anything wrong with Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques, and could only consult Zi Xunyi.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is removing the three treasures on him. Mingchao, you must stop him right now. You cannot allow him to do that,&rdquo; Zi Xunyi said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, stop! That slaughtering formation is yet to be completely destroyed. You must not remove the power of your healing formation,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao hurriedly spoke to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng had managed to overcome all the obstacles on the way and cut through many slaughtering formations.<br>Although it was mainly due to Chu Feng&rsquo;s meticulous techniques, the three treasures also provided enormous assistance.<br>And now, it was precisely the most crucial moment in breaking through this slaughtering formation for Chu Feng. If he was to lower his guard now, he could very well ruin everything.<br>However, even though Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s words reached Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears, Chu Feng did not stop.<br>He finished forming his hand seal. Then, Chu Feng tossed the war blade and compass toward the sky.<br>The next moment, Chu Feng unleashed his completed hand seal, and the golden armor that had covered his body was also removed from him. That golden armor turned into a golden light and fused together with the war blade and compass.<br>After the three treasures fused together, they turned into dazzling golden radiance. Like a waterfall, the golden light began to fall from the sky, completely covering Chu Feng within it.<br>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; Many people were confused.<br>&ldquo;It seems that Chu Feng has another plan in mind.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi realized that Chu Feng did not do this with the intention of renouncing the three treasures. Evidently, he had something else in mind.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, the six gaseous flames that were gradually growing fainter suddenly became much stronger.<br>The intensity of those gaseous flames was ten times their strongest intensity from before.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?!&rdquo;<br>The crowd outside the Unknown Burial Ground were all deeply frightened upon seeing this scene.<br>Although they were only able to see with their naked eyes, and were simply unable to sense the true might and power of those gaseous flames, they were able to determine exactly how frighteningly powerful the gaseous flames that had grown much more intense now were, based on how difficult it was for Chu Feng to defeat the gaseous flames from before.<br>Counterattack. It was that slaughtering formation&rsquo;s counterattack. It was its strongest attack, its final attack.<br>If Chu Feng was able to withstand it, he would have defeated the slaughtering formation. If he was unable to withstand it, Chu Feng would die here.<br>The crowd felt that Chu Feng might not necessarily be able to withstand it. After all, the gaseous flames were so much more ferocious this time around.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng&hellip; why isn&rsquo;t he panicking?&rdquo;<br>At this moment when everyone was frightened by the gaseous flames, they were shocked to discover that Chu Feng, who was inside that slaughtering formation was actually completely confident. There was not the slightest trace of panic on his face.<br>His confident appearance seemed to indicate that everything was within his grasp.<br><br></p></div>
