        <div> - Bravely Fighting Against A Lowly Insect<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Haha, that insect is truly vile. Chu Feng, it&rsquo;ll be an enormous embarrassment if you are unable to catch it,&rdquo; At that moment, Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s body was convulsing with laughter. She was truly feeling delighted. No, to be exact, she was rejoicing in Chu Feng&rsquo;s misfortune.<br>&ldquo;If I catch it, I&rsquo;ll definitely teach it a lesson,&rdquo; Chu Feng was enraged by that insect. The lightning in his eyes grew even more violent. Then, two lightning wings began to spread out from his back like two sharp blades.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation increased to that of a rank three Martial Emperor. His speed once again increased by many times.<br>&ldquo;Holy mother! Save me!!!&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng&rsquo;s speed had actually increased once again, the little red insect cried out in alarm. It was so frightened that it started to panic in disarray. At the same time, it continued to shout, &ldquo;What sort of abnormal creature are you?! How are you able to increase your cultivation? Aiya, you&rsquo;re making me piss myself in fear. Mom, save me!!!!&rdquo;<br>It was clear that little insect&rsquo;s speed was already at its limit. That was why it started to panic like that after Chu Feng increased his cultivation. The reason for that was because that little red insect knew that he would not be able to escape Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Little thing, I shall see how you&rsquo;re going to continue to act arrogant,&rdquo; At that moment, Chu Feng was traveling like a flash of lightning. He arrived before the little red insect and grabbed it in his hand.<br>Once that little red insect was captured by Chu Feng, it immediately became extremely obedient. It did not try to struggle, nor did it try to say anything. Instead, it looked to Chu Feng with a very pitiful appearance.<br>&ldquo;Come, insult me again. Continue to insult me,&rdquo; Chu Feng stared at the little red insect angrily.<br>&ldquo;Granddaddy, please don&rsquo;t kill me. I was merely joking with you,&rdquo; The little red insect said in a very wronged manner.<br>&ldquo;Pah!&rdquo; At that moment, Chu Feng felt as if a hundred thousand divine beasts had burst out of his heart. He thought to himself that this little red insect was truly too shameless.<br>This red insect most definitely possessed intelligence. Furthermore, it was not a newborn. Else, it would not be able to amuse itself with Chu Feng like it had. Furthermore, it calling Chu Feng granddaddy right now was all an act.<br>&ldquo;Do not call me granddaddy, call me &lsquo;great sir,&rsquo;&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Yes, great sir. Great sir, I was merely playing around earlier. Can you please spare me?&rdquo; The little red insect pleaded in a very pitiful manner.<br>&ldquo;Did you take me to be a fool?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;No, of course not. I think great sir is extremely smart,&rdquo; The little red insect said.<br>&ldquo;Shut up, enough of your ass-kissing. You damned vile insect! You actually dared to insult me earlier; I&rsquo;m going to feed you to the birds,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Are you serious? Are you really going to feed me to the birds?&rdquo; Hearing what Chu Feng said, the insect was immediately startled. Its gaze began to change.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chu Feng said in a very determined manner.<br>&ldquo;Your grandma even begged you! You damned fool! I&rsquo;ll bite you to death! Quickly, release me! Else, my parents will turn you into a fried dough twist. They&rsquo;ll soak you with tea and then eat you like a dessert!&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng was planning to kill it, the little red insect immediately unmasked its true appearance and began to rain curses upon Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You dare insult me again! I&rsquo;ll teach you a lesson!&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he began to release electricity in his hand. Even though his opponent was merely an insect, it possessed a special body that was extremely strong.<br>However, as a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, Chu Feng possessed countless means to torture it.<br>&ldquo;Noooo!!!!!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the scream of a little insect resonated through the forest in continuous waves.<br>&ldquo;Eh, that&rsquo;s strange. How do you know what birds are?&rdquo; Suddenly, Chu Feng stopped tormenting the insect and questioned it curiously.<br>&ldquo;Of course I know what birds are. Aren&rsquo;t you looking down on me a bit too much? Even though we Royal Spirit Insect Race live in here, we possess an abundant amount of knowledge,&rdquo; The little red insect said.<br>&ldquo;Royal Spirit Insect Race? So you all are actually called Royal Spirit Insects?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; The little red insect nodded.<br>&ldquo;In that case, do you know what sort of race I am from?&rdquo; Chu Feng was carried away by a sudden impulse and began to ask the little insect curiously.<br>&ldquo;Of course I do. I&rsquo;ve heard that there are many different races outside of the Blood Devouring Killing Formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, the races possess different levels of strength. You belong to the weakest race,&rdquo; The little red insect said.<br>&ldquo;The weakest?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes started to shine. He started to ponder.<br>Although the humans were the strongest after the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves in the current Holy Land of Martialism, it was true that the humans were martial cultivators that were extremely weak compared to the other creatures in this world.<br>In fact, a little rock falling from the sky would be capable of smashing a human to death. Thus, upon thinking about it, what that little insect said could be considered to be correct.<br>&ldquo;In that case, tell me, what sort of race am I?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pig,&rdquo; The little red insect said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. He glared at the little insect and said, &ldquo;Say it again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pig.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ahh!!! Nooo!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Was I wrong?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that you&rsquo;re not a pig?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What are you then? Ahh! Noo! Spare me!! I am still only a child!&rdquo; The screams from the little red insect began to resonate through the forest once again. Chu Feng only stopped after torturing the little insect for quite some time.<br>Although he was tormenting the little insect, Chu Feng was actually using his world spirit techniques to test the little insect&rsquo;s body.<br>After his testing, Chu Feng discovered that little insect was truly miraculous. Although it was feeling pain from Chu Feng&rsquo;s torture, it would be extremely, extremely difficult for Chu Feng to kill it.<br>In other words, Chu Feng, with his current strength, was unable to kill that little insect. As such, one could see how strong that little insect&rsquo;s vitality was.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng started to feel a bit uneasy. When this little insect was already this strong, how strong would those mature Royal Spirit Insects be? This creature by the name of Royal Spirit Insect was truly too frightening.<br>Upon thinking about it, Chu Feng immediately grabbed that little insect tightly in his hand to make it unable to speak. Furthermore, he sealed away its aura. Then, he rapidly proceeded to the place where Xian Miaomiao was resting.<br>When Chu Feng returned, he discovered that Xian Miaomiao was actually gone. The spirit formation that he had set up had been destroyed by someone.<br>&ldquo;Crap!&rdquo; At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression took a huge change. He felt that the situation was bad.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, many sounds of rapid movement could be heard in the distance. They were growing closer. Soon, a silhouette appeared before Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng was immediately overjoyed upon seeing this person. The reason for that was because it was none other than Xian Miaomiao.<br>&ldquo;Miaomiao, where did you go?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I should be the one asking you that. Where did you go? Why were you nowhere to be found after I woke up?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao asked angrily. This was the first time Chu Feng had ever seen her this angry. Her anger this time around was different from her anger in the past. She was angry because she was worried for Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng started to blame himself. Although he had gone to search for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Flower by himself with good intentions, he should have left behind some message in order to prevent Xian Miaomiao from becoming worried for him. He had truly neglected that.<br>&ldquo;MIaomiao, I&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng wanted to apologize to her.<br>&ldquo;Hey! Beauty!&rdquo; Right at that moment, the little insect in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand suddenly spoke. This fellow actually broke apart the spirit formation that Chu Feng had bound it with.<br>Not only that, it currently had a very pitiful and harmless appearance as it looked to Xian Miaomiao with deep emotions in its eyes. That fellow was clearly trying to obtain Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s pity.<br>&ldquo;Aiya, Chu Feng, what is that thing in your hand?&rdquo; Sure enough, Xian Miaomiao noticed it. Not only that, she was also surprised and overjoyed. Her expression was as if a refugee had just discovered a new world.<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip; it&rsquo;s a Royal Spirit Insect. If I am not mistaken, it should be&hellip; that legendary creature you spoke of,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br></p></div>
