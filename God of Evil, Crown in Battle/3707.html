        <div> - Determination To Confront Death<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the situation had turned bad, Chu Feng also began to think of a way to help Gu Mingyuan.<br>Unfortunately, even though he was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he was still helpless against the situation.<br>Seeing Gu Mingyuan about to be sucked into that spirit formation gate, Chu Feng was burning with anxiety.<br>However, he was unable to move. He had to use all of his strength to seal off the spirit formation gate before him. If he didn&rsquo;t, it would send out waves again.<br>The waves would push from all directions, and Gu Mingyuan was now also within range.<br>If things weren&rsquo;t lucky, the wave might directly push Gu Mingyuan into that spirit formation gate emitting the aura of death.<br>Should that be the case, not only would Chu Feng bring forth harm upon Gu Mingyuan, but even he himself would be drawn into the spirit formation gate of death.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at this moment of imminent peril, a figure suddenly entered the sea from above. That person directly arrived before the spirit formation gate emitting the suction power and stopped it.<br>Upon seeing that person, Chu Feng and Gu Mingyuan both cried out &lsquo;oh no&rsquo; in their hearts.<br>The two of them both recognize that person. It was Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s father, Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>That spirit formation gate was very dangerous. For Chu Xuanzhengfa to appear before it, he would undoubtedly be courting death.<br>&ldquo;Why did you come down here? Wasn&rsquo;t it said that you could not come in here with your cultivation?&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Xuanzhengfa, Gu Mingyuan revealed a look of nervousness and worry.<br>This was the first time Chu Feng had seen such an expression on Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s face.<br>Gu Mingyuan had been reacting to Chu Xuanzhengfa with anger and disgust the entire time.<br>If he didn&rsquo;t see it himself, Chu Feng would not have believed that Gu Mingyuan would worry for Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>&ldquo;I am Lingxi&rsquo;s father. How could I watch passively from above while the two of you risked your lives?&rdquo; said Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>&ldquo;But you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Gu Mingyuan wanted to say something. However, before she could finish, Chu Xuanzhengfa interrupted her, &ldquo;Say no more. Mingyuan, seize this moment and retrieve the Deepsea Pupils. I&hellip; will not be able to last for long.&rdquo;<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa was not joking around. At that moment, close to half of his body had been sucked into the spirit formation gate.<br>His veins bulged, and there was an expression of pain on his face.<br>Even though he had managed to block the spirit formation gate with his body, he did not appear to be able to last for long.<br>Seeing that, Gu Mingyuan did not dare to hesitate in the slightest. She immediately rushed towards the Deepsea Pupils again.<br>This time, she smoothly arrived before the Deepsea Pupils and managed to come into contact with them.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>In an instant, blue light started shining brightly. In an instant, the blue light engulfed the entire sea.<br>At that moment, the sea became extremely beautiful. The violently surging undercurrents all stopped.<br>Unfortunately, the suction power of that spirit formation gate was still present. Furthermore, the spirit formation gate Chu Feng was tasked with sealing was also present.<br>Most importantly, even though Gu Mingyuan had managed to get ahold of the Deepsea Pupils, it was no easy task for her to retrieve them.<br>The two Deepsea Pupils seemed to be fixed in place. Even a martial cultivation expert like Gu Mingyuan was unable to move them.<br>&ldquo;Eeeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Gu Mingyuan let out a loud shout, and released an enormous amount of power.<br>As the power she released was too powerful, it began to wreak havoc. Even the soil on the seabed started to burst apart.<br>That entire region of sea started to tremble violently. It seemed like the sea was boiling over.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a loud explosion was heard. The sea started to quake violently. It seemed like the world was about the collapse.<br>However, that terror did not occur. Instead, the Deepsea Pupils entered Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s hands.<br>At that moment, Gu Mingyuan turned her gaze to Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa had been completely sucked into the spirit formation gate. Only his hands were still tightly grabbing onto the spirit formation gate.<br>Neither Chu Feng or Gu Mingyuan were still able to see him. However, they were able to hear his voice.<br>&ldquo;Mingyuan, take care of Lingxi,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s voice sounded from the spirit formation gate.<br>Chu Feng was able to see that even though Gu Mingyuan had a look of hesitation, she knew her mission.<br>She clenched her teeth and then started rising, rushing toward the surface of the sea.<br>Only her voice was still resonating in the sea...<br>&ldquo;Hold on a bit longer. I will come back to save you two immediately.&rdquo;<br>After Gu Mingyuan reached a safe area, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body shifted, and he began to rush toward Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>He couldn&rsquo;t possibly watch and do nothing as Chu Xuanzhengfa died. He was determined to pull him out from that spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;Wuuah~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after Chu Feng left, the spirit formation gate that he was sealing immediately released a powerful wave.<br>The wave pushed Chu Feng straight toward the spirit formation gate emitting the attractive force.<br>Chu Feng had guessed correctly. Sure enough, the spirit formation gate that emitted waves ended up pushing him toward the other spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t come over!!!&rdquo;<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s voice sounded again. After his voice was heard, his hands let go of the spirit formation gate.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa was unable to withstand the powerful suction force, and had completely fallen into that spirit formation gate.<br>Hearing Chu Xuanzhengfa, Chu Feng felt extremely complicated.<br>Behind him was an enormously powerful wave pushing him forward. Even if he wanted to back out, he would not have the chance to do so.<br>That said, Chu Feng had no intention to back out. Since he had made the decision to save Chu Xuanzhengfa, he was naturally prepared for the possibility of death.<br>Thus, without cowering, Chu Feng rushed straight into the spirit formation gate that was emitting that enormous suction.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Meanwhile. Gu Mingyuan arrived above the Mirror Sea.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, please take care of Lingxi for me.&rdquo;<br>Gu Mingyuan handed the Deepsea Pupils to Grandmaster Liangqiu. Then, she took a glance at the still unconscious Chu Lingxi.<br>Love filled Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s eyes. At the same time, she felt very relaxed.<br>After obtaining the Deepsea Pupils, she was acting like she had completed her mission.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, she turned around and intended to dive back into the sea.<br>This time around, her eyes were filled with determination. It was the determination to face death.<br>However, before Gu Mingyuan could dive back into the sea, she was stopped by a hand. It was old man Zhu.<br>&ldquo;This girl has already lost her father. Are you planning to have her lose her mother too?&rdquo; he asked.<br>However, Gu Mingyuan did not hesitate. Her body shifted, and a big splash soared into the sky. She had dived back into the Mirror Sea.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu realized that the situation was bad. Not knowing the truth, he turned to ask his friend, &ldquo;Brother Zhu, you&rsquo;re able to see the situation inside?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be&hellip; Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa have met a bitter encounter?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
