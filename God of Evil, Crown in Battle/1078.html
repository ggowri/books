        <h1>Chapter 1078</h1>
        <div> -The Conceited Xian Kun<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It would appear that I need to be more careful.&rdquo; As Chu Feng watched the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elf by the name of Xian Kun nearly being driven mad, he not only stealthily laughed, he also raised alarm in his heart.<br>Chu Feng felt that this Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elf was no fool. As forty-eight hours had already passed, this greatly surpassed the amount of time required to trigger the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle. Yet, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle was still not triggered. This meant that there was only a single cause - that other than him, there was someone else at this place.<br>Thus, Chu Feng felt that this Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elf might soon begin to frantically search all over the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond to find exactly who it was that meddled in his deed.<br>His opponent&rsquo;s cultivation was a rank five Martial King and, as a genius of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, ought to contain many secret techniques.<br>Thus, even though they couldn&rsquo;t use spirit power in this place, Chu Feng must still carefully hide himself. Otherwise, if he was to be discovered by his opponent, then, with his opponent&rsquo;s strength, Chu Feng would likely die.<br>Likely, Chu Feng would be faced with an extremely dangerous situation. That was because even he was unable to ascertain whether that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elf would be able to discover him in this place.<br>However, for the purpose of triggering this Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle and smear on the face of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves while winning honor for the human race, Chu Feng insisted on staying here.<br>Chu Feng chose a place to hide himself. Using his strongest concealing technique, he hid himself. After that, he ceased all movement.<br>Time slowly passed. Even Chu Feng felt the situation a bit unendurable. That was because he did not know when that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elf by the name of Xian Kun might appear before him and inspect the surroundings using a powerful method.<br>However, to Chu Feng&rsquo;s surprise, after several hours had passed, that Xian Kun still had not appeared. This caused Chu Feng to become puzzled. After his confusion, he decided to put his all into the fight and take the initiative to that Xian Kun to see exactly what he was planning to do.<br>When he arrived at the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal needle, Chu Feng finally saw that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elf again. At the same time, he also saw a scene that he didn&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or cry about.<br>&ldquo;Clank, clank, clank&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At this moment, ear piercing sounds were being emitted from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle unceasingly. It turned out that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elf was actually frantically attacking the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle. While attacking it, he even cursed loudly.<br>&ldquo;F*ck! What the f*ck is going on?! It&rsquo;s been so long, why are you still not being triggered?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Despicable! I have even triggered the Silver Needle from the Kingdom and nearly triggered a Golden Needle! I refuse to believe that I am unable to trigger you!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I failed, how would I have any more face to meet the others?! How would I have any more face to meet the others?! I swear that if you do not trigger now, then after I become a Martial Emperor, after I become a general, I will come back and destroy you!!&rdquo;<br>At this moment, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elf had been driven completely mad. He was currently venting his anger on the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle. He was truly in a violent fury because Chu Feng was even able to sense his strong killing intent. In short, the surrounding area of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle had already been beaten by him into a miserable state. It was already an appalling scene of devastation.<br>&ldquo;This Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elf&rsquo;s battle power is truly amazing. Unfortunately, he&rsquo;s an idiot. Chu Feng, you truly have overestimated him. You actually even made preparations to evade him. Who would&rsquo;ve known, he actually never planned to find you to begin with.&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, Eggy burst into a loud laughter. She was convulsed with laughter. That was because she felt that this Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elf by the name of Xian Kun was truly too ridiculous. Although he was a genius, he was simultaneously an idiot.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s likely that he isn&rsquo;t an idiot. Instead, he&rsquo;s overly conceited.&rdquo; At this moment, Chu Feng shook his head with a bitter smile.<br>He felt that it was impossible for someone who managed to reach Xian Kun&rsquo;s cultivation to have a low intelligence. However, because he was too conceited, he lost his reason in conceit and thought that, other than him, there was simply no one else who could reach the bottom of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond.<br>Thus, even though Xian Kun felt that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle was acting strange, he never imagined for there to be a Chu Feng at the bottom of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond alongside him.<br>&ldquo;F*ck! Exactly what is happening?! What the hell is wrong with this Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What is wrong, that&rsquo;s right, what is wrong. It&rsquo;s you, you&rsquo;re definitely malfunctioning! I most definitely have already triggered you! It&rsquo;s merely that you have yet to show yourself being triggered by me! Perhaps you have already released the lightning outside of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond and I merely did not know about that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha, that&rsquo;s most definitely the case. That&rsquo;s most definitely the case! Perhaps the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle in this place is different from the one in the kingdom and that it would simply not give any motion after being triggered. Instead, it would directly release the lightning at the top.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, this is the case, this is definitely the case. I am truly muddled. I am truly muddled. Hahahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>After a display of his violent rage, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elf appeared to have come to a sudden realization. He actually began to laugh heartily. While laughing, he even patted his own head. Then, he suddenly moved his body and started to dash. With unimaginable speed, he left the bottom of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond.<br>&ldquo;Look! Quickly, look! Did you see that?! This Xian Kun, how exactly is he conceited. He is most definitely an idiot! Hahahaha&hellip;.&rdquo;<br>Hearing Xian Kun&rsquo;s laughter gradually grow further and further away and quickly disappearing, Eggy began to laugh even more heartily. She even decisively declared this Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Elf by the name of Xian Kun to be an idiot.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng who had been surveying Xian Kun in the distance with deep precautions had black lines rolling down his head. This time around, Chu Feng had miscalculated. He had no choice but to admit that he had overestimated this Xian Kun fellow. Moreover, he had also been completely stupefied by Xian Kun&rsquo;s actions.<br>At this moment, everything remained pretty much the same on the water surface of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond, everyone was training. If a change must be determined, then it would be that a lot of the cultivators who were training within the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond had already emerged onto the water surface.<br>It was not that they did not wish to continue to train within the water. It was just that they truly could not withstand the pressure anymore. For the sake of not having any accidents, they had no choice but to emerge to the surface as they no longer dared to continue to withstand the pressure within the water.<br>However, several figures were hidden in the boundless ocean of mist above the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond. All of these figures were the management elders from the Southern Domain. They possessed extraordinary status and formidable strength. Practically any one of them would be able to shake this entire region.<br>Other than these management elders, even the leader of the Southern Domain, that Southern Elf Lord, was present.<br>They had serious expressions as they firmly fixed their gazes at the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond down below. A feeling of unease began to emerge from them.<br>&ldquo;Master Elf Lord, it has been a very long time already. Yet, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle has yet to be triggered and Lord Xian Kun did not emerge either. Could it be that he tried to show off excessively and encountered an accident?&rdquo; Said a management elder in worry.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s improbable. With Lord Xian Kun&rsquo;s talent, even if he is unable to trigger the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle, he should not have any mishaps.&rdquo; The Southern Elf Lord shook his head. However, displayed within his eyes was an unconcealable worry.<br>&ldquo;Putt.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, an enormous wave appeared on the tranquil water surface. At the same time, a figure burst out from the water like a dragon, rushed into the boundless ocean of white mist and arrived before the Southern Elf Lord and the others.<br>Upon seeing this person who had come, the Southern Elf Lord was overjoyed. He hurriedly walked forward and said, &ldquo;Lord Xian Kun, you&rsquo;ve finally come out. I am truly relieved to see that you&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;See that I&rsquo;m fine? How could anything possibly happen to me?&rdquo; Xian Kun waved his hand. Then, with a slightly annoyed tone, he asked, &ldquo;Southern Elf Lord, this Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle ought to have been triggered by me, right? Why didn&rsquo;t you find a method to inform me about it and instead made me wait around in vain at the bottom of the Immortal Pond?&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing Xian Kun&rsquo;s words, the Southern Elf Lord and the others were all startled. Then, with deep confusion, they asked, &ldquo;Lord Xian Kun, what did you say?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
