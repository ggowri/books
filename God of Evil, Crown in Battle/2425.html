        <div> - The Truth Revealed<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Brother Shunlian, you actually used a life origin treasure to protect them? Do you really not care about dying?&rdquo; Seeing the copper bowl, the two Supreme Elders revealed astonished and difficult expressions.<br>As they were members of the same clan, they had already anticipated that Kong Shunlian might end up betraying their clan.<br>However, they did not make preparations to actually kill Kong Shunlian.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve known each other for so long, do you all still not understand me, Kong Shunlian? You can either let me and these two little friends leave together today, or kill me together with them,&rdquo; Kong Shunlian said with a beaming smile.<br>Kong Shunlian did not show the slightest bit of cowardice or fear when he said those words. Instead, those words sounded more like a jest.<br>The current Kong Shunlian no longer feared death. He had truly made the decision to protect Chu Feng and Wang Qiang with his life.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shunlian, to tell the truth, we truly cannot bear to kill you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the interest of our clan surpasses everything else. Today&hellip; even if we cannot bear to kill you, we will still attack you with the intent to kill,&rdquo; After these words were said, the two Supreme Elders both unleashed attacks at Kong Shunlian.<br>&ldquo;Then come, and let&rsquo;s battle to our heart&rsquo;s content,&rdquo; Holding his Ancestral Armament in his hand, Kong Shunlian collided with the two Supreme Elders.<br>At this moment, it was no longer only two True Immortals fighting in this region. Instead, it had become a battlefield with five True Immortals fighting.<br>The might of the battlefield instantly increased by manyfold. The frightening energy ripples also expanded their range.<br>Furthermore, the people that had come to visit Chu Feng had also managed to gradually approach the battlefield.<br>However, as they saw the darkened sky and earth, and the surging black clouds that rapidly flashed with dazzling light, they simply did not dare to approach the battlefield.<br>&ldquo;What frightening might. This old man was fortunate to have witnessed a confrontation between two True Immortals. However, their might is far inferior to this. It would appear that the True Immortals fighting today are even more powerful. Exactly what is happening?&rdquo;<br>The crowd did not dare to approach, and could only watch from afar. In this sort of situation, the great majority of them were simply unable to see exactly what was happening.<br>&ldquo;Allow this old man to have a look.&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, an old man wearing a cloak moved to the front of the crowd.<br>After this old man appeared, many people started to scoff at him. There were a lot of people present. Thus, although they possessed all different sorts of cultivation, many of them were peak Martial Ancestors.<br>When even peak Martial Ancestors were unable to determine the situation of the True Immortals&rsquo; battle, how could this old man possibly possess the capability to do so?<br>Seemingly knowing the crowd&rsquo;s misgivings, the old man removed the hood over his head and revealed his appearance.<br>This was a dark-skinned, horse-faced, white-skinned old man that emitted an extraordinary aura.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually Senior Zhuge, who has been withdrawn from worldly affairs for so long.&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing this old man, the expressions of the crowd all changed.<br>This old man was called Zhuge Mingren. He was a grand character.<br>What did the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm lack the most? That would be none other than Immortal-cloak World Spiritists. As for this Zhuge Mingren, he was a Snake Marked Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>In the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, he could be said to be a very renowned individual.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, don&rsquo;t be anxious. This old man will observe what is happening.&rdquo;<br>Zhuge Mingren&rsquo;s gaze started to shine like two small lights.<br>His shining gaze was able to see through the surging energy ripples that were wreaking havoc and creating dust storms throughout the battlefield.<br>Gradually, Zhuge Mingren was able to clearly see what was happening on the battlefield.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; it&rsquo;s actually the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elders who are fighting,&rdquo; Zhuge Mingren revealed an astonished voice.<br>&ldquo;What? The Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elders?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the crowd were also endlessly astonished.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Kong Shunlian is fighting against Kong Moyu and two other Supreme Elders.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Elder Kong Shunlian is not alone either. There is another person helping him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, that individual assisting Elder Kong Shunlian is someone who I&rsquo;m unfamiliar with. However, that individual is also a True Immortal-level expert.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Likely, that individual must be a senior who has withdrawn from worldly affairs for a very long time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng and Wang Qiang are also present. Currently, they are being protected,&rdquo; Zhuge Mingren told everyone all that he managed to see.<br>&ldquo;Crap! Kong Moyu and the others are actually planning to kill Chu Feng and Wang Qiang,&rdquo; Zhuge Mingren was, after all, a Snake Marked Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Merely by looking at the movements of their mouths, Zhuge Mingren was able to tell what they were saying.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re actually planning to kill Chu Feng and Wang Qiang? Why are they doing this?&rdquo; The crowd was both confused and astonished by this. This news was truly too explosive.<br>One must know that Chu Feng was the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s honored guest who had just left the Kong Heavenly Clan.<br>Earlier, the Kong Heavenly Clan had seen him off enthusiastically. As such, how could they decide to kill Chu Feng and Wang Qiang the very next moment?<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re saying something like Chu Feng concerns the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s continued existence. Furthermore, it seems that this is related to Grandmaster Prophet,&rdquo; Zhuge Mingren had no idea what was happening, and could only learn a bit from the conversation between Kong Shunlian, Kong Moyu and the others.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, don&rsquo;t bother guessing anymore. It is Grandmaster Prophet, he prophesied that Chu Feng would bring about the destruction of the Kong Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, the Kong Heavenly Clan is planning to kill little friend Chu Feng, who possessed neither hatred nor grievances against their Kong Heavenly Clan, merely because of that one prophecy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Kong Heavenly Clan is simply incomparably selfish. They are unqualified to be known as an upright power, a tier one power.&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, a thunder-like voice sounded from the battlefield and entered the crowd&rsquo;s ears.<br>It was that mysterious individual. That mysterious individual had noticed that the crowd had approached the battlefield, and knew that they must be guessing what was happening. Thus, he took the initiative to reveal the truth to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Abominable! The Kong Heavenly Clan actually wants to kill Chu Feng and Wang Qiang merely because of a prophecy?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng and Wang Qiang are rare geniuses of our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. They are existences that could potentially become the second Grandmaster Kai Hong, the second Zhan Haichuan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph, no wonder the Kong Heavenly Clan refused to allow us to see little friends Chu Feng and Wang Qiang. Turned out they planned to kill them to begin with.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, it&rsquo;s simply not because of a prophecy. Instead, it&rsquo;s because the Kong Heavenly Clan is jealous of Chu Feng and Wang Qiang&rsquo;s talent. They are afraid that they will suppress their Kong Heavenly Clan once they mature. Thus, they want to strangle their growth by killing them before they mature.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Thinking about it, Lord Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s death back then was also extremely fishy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Though the Kong Heavenly Clan and the Zhou Heavenly Clan declared that Lord Ying Mingchao was the one who wanted to kill them, that they only managed to kill Lord Ying Mingchao after resisting him with their all, it remains that that was only what they declared to have happened.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for what truly happened, we simply have no idea at all. The only pitiful thing is that Hero City was destroyed by the Kong Heavenly Clan and the Zhou Heavenly Clan just because of that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. What happened back then was extremely suspicious. It was only because the Kong Heavenly Clan and the Ying Heavenly Clan were so powerful that no one dared to say anything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet today, this Kong Heavenly Clan actually wants to kill Chu Feng and Wang Qiang, two rare geniuses. We absolutely cannot allow them to get away with this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We cannot allow them to get away with this. I will immediately spread word of this matter. We cannot let Chu Feng and Wang Qiang die like this.&rdquo;<br>Upon knowing the truth, the crowd was furious. After all, these were all people who had come here for Chu Feng and Wang Qiang.<br>At this moment, many people chose to leave. They were not trying to escape. Rather, they planned to quickly spread news of this matter. They hoped that they could attract the attention of True Immortal-level experts to help save Chu Feng and Wang Qiang.<br><br></p></div>
