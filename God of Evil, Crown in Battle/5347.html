        <h1>Chapter 5348</h1>
        <div>: A Bunch of Lackeys<br>&ldquo;You're formidable, Chu Feng. I didn&rsquo;t think that you would be able to awaken this treasure. It&rsquo;s no wonder my son lost to you.&rdquo;<br>Young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father looked at the crystal with an irrepressible grin. His initial plan was to steal the treasure as it was, but he managed to procure the treasure awakened instead. The Pill Dao Immortal Sect would surely handsomely reward him for this&hellip; and this was all thanks to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Return it to me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said icily.<br>&ldquo;Return it to you? Why should I? Just because you&rsquo;re the strongest Martial Exalted level cultivator?&rdquo; young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father sneered.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up. &ldquo;Be prepared to face the consequences then.&rdquo;<br>A cold air swept across the surroundings, inducing chills down one&rsquo;s spine. It was killing intent, Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing intent!<br>The crowd looked at Chu Feng fearfully. Never had they felt such intense killing intent from a junior. However, young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father burst into laughter.<br>&ldquo;Be prepared to face the consequences? Chu Feng, do you know who I am?&rdquo; young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father asked.<br>&ldquo;Why should I care about that?&rdquo; Chu Feng snorted impatiently.<br>He was not oblivious to how powerful young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father was, but he had the Divine Deer and the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Strongest Token should things go awry. Even if he couldn&rsquo;t kill them today, he would make them pay the price in due time.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, stop putting on airs. Do you honestly think that the world is afraid of you just because you are the strongest Martial Exalted level cultivator? Let me tell you&mdash;I already know your background. You&rsquo;re nothing more than a wild child without any backing!&rdquo; young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father said.<br>&ldquo;What? Young master Chu Feng has no backing?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was shocked. They were certain that Chu Feng would have some incredibly strong power behind him. However, it didn&rsquo;t seem like young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father and the others were lying, judging from their confident attitude. Even the white-haired elder who was wary of Chu Feng earlier no longer displayed any trace of fear.<br>This left the crowd wondering if Chu Feng really had no backing at all. They turned to look at Chu Feng, and they couldn&rsquo;t help but think that he looked much lesser than what he did earlier.<br>This was how pragmatic the world of cultivation was. No matter how talented Chu Feng was, he was nothing but a mere junior right now. His current strength was insignificant compared to the many experts in this vast world of cultivation.<br>There was no lack of prodigies in the world of cultivation, and a prodigy without backing was nothing at all.<br>&ldquo;It was all a pretense!&rdquo; Zhou Shuang sneered gleefully.<br>She had been harboring a grudge toward Chu Feng for a while now, and it pleased her to see Chu Feng in trouble.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng chuckled. He looked at young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was surprised. They couldn&rsquo;t understand why Chu Feng suddenly said those words. The same went for young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father and the others too.<br>In truth, Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess was based on the fact that young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father and the others were clearly after him, or else the latter wouldn&rsquo;t have known that he was from a humble background. Considering how he didn&rsquo;t have a grudge against them, it was more likely that they were doing this under someone else&rsquo;s order.<br>Of the powers he was hostile with, the only one who could mobilize a Saint Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist was the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. I have no idea what&rsquo;s your basis behind that guess, but it&rsquo;s utter nonsense,&rdquo; young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father refuted the accusation.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered. He was already certain that they were here under the orders of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. &ldquo;I advise you to turn back now, or else you&rsquo;ll only be courting your own doom.&rdquo;<br>Those words might have intimidated young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father in the past, but now that he had gotten to the bottom of Chu Feng&rsquo;s background, he knew that the latter was just putting on a brave front.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you do have a way with words. How are you able to speak so confidently when you don&rsquo;t have anyone behind you? Unfortunately for you, I&rsquo;m not one to be intimidated that easily. Let me put you back in your place right now!&rdquo;<br>Young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father released his spirit power and formed a gigantic slaughter formation.<br>The crowd paled at the sight of the slaughter formation. They sensed that it harnessed more than enough power to kill all of them, and they were worried that young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father would do just that.<br>However, young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father didn&rsquo;t activate the slaughter formation right away. Instead, with a wave of his sleeves, he summoned a huge formation sword in the sky and tore open a deep gorge on the mountain peak.<br>&ldquo;Listen well, all of you. I&rsquo;m only after Chu Feng. Step down now, and I&rsquo;ll allow you to safely leave this place,&rdquo; young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father said.<br>The crowd understood what those words meant and hurriedly stepped across the gorge, positioning themselves opposite to Chu Feng. In the blink of an eye, the only ones standing on Chu Feng&rsquo;s side were from the Zhou Clan.<br>&ldquo;Does the Zhou Clan intend to die together with Chu Feng?&rdquo; Young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father looked at the Zhou Clan with narrowed eyes.<br>&ldquo;My apologies, young master Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>The Zhou Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was so afraid that he only dared to speak via voice transmission. After uttering an apology, he stepped across the gorge and stood opposite Chu Feng.<br>The other members of the Zhou Clan also quickly did the same too. In just a few moments, there were barely a handful of people standing on Chu Feng&rsquo;s side, namely Zhou Yi, Zhou Zhi, and the other juniors of the Zhou Clan.<br>It was almost ironic how the bravest ones in this life-and-death situation were the juniors.<br>&ldquo;Third Sister, what are you doing? Are you planning to die together with that nobody?&rdquo; a mocking voice echoed. It was from Zhou Shuang.<br>Even though Zhou Zhi and the other juniors of the Zhou Clan were standing with Chu Feng too, she had specifically chosen to target Zhou Yi.<br>The crowd thought that she was being too two-faced by demeaning Chu Feng even though the latter had just done the Zhou Clan a huge favor, but no one dared to refute her. After all, no one wanted to die in vain here.<br>&ldquo;What are you waiting for? Come over!&rdquo; the Zhou Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief roared.<br>&ldquo;My deepest apologies, young master Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Zhou Yi had a conflicted look on her face, but she still chose to step across the gorge to join her father. The other juniors also received instructions from the other elders in the clan and headed over to the other side.<br>However, there was one person who continued to stand on Chu Feng&rsquo;s side&mdash;Zhou Zhi.<br>Chu Feng looked at Zhou Zhi in surprise. He hadn&rsquo;t thought that the latter would be the last person from the Zhou Clan to remain on his side.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you offended those fellows for our Zhou Clan. I am the one who stirred up this mess; there&rsquo;s no way I can allow you to face this all by yourself,&rdquo; Zhou Zhi said.<br>Chu Feng smiled at those words. Those words changed his impression of Zhou Zhi. He wouldn&rsquo;t have thought that the most courageous person in the Zhou Clan was this reckless young man.<br>Shoosh!<br>All of a sudden, Zhou Zhi had his spirit power restrained and was forcefully dragged away. It was the doing of the Zhou Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>There was no way the Zhou Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would allow the only hope of their Zhou Clan, as well as his son, to pass away just like that.<br>With that, Chu Feng was left all alone.<br>Zhou Shuang cast aside her hypocritical face to directly mock Chu Feng. Her abhorrent and ungrateful attitude induced the disgust of the crowd, but still, not a single person said a word about that.<br>Young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father was satisfied with this outcome.<br>&ldquo;Do you see this, Chu Feng? This is the reality of our world. Those people only fawned over you because they thought that you have a strong background. The moment they realize that you have nothing at all, they choose to leave your side&hellip; even though you have fought for them just a moment ago. I admit that you&rsquo;re indeed a highly talented individual, but it&rsquo;s a pity that you don&rsquo;t have any backing. People like you are destined to die a premature death,&rdquo; young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father sneered.<br>Boom!<br>A roaring explosion reverberated in the sky. The slaughter formation constructed by young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father shattered into smithereens.<br>Four individuals flitted down and positioned themselves in front of Chu Feng.<br>The crowd, including Chu Feng, was stunned to see those four individuals, for they were renowned throughout the entire Totem Galaxy. They were none other than Daoist Ninth Dragon, Daoist Eighth Dragon, Daoist Seventh Dragon, and Daoist Sixth Dragon.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, our apologies for arriving late,&rdquo; Daoist Ninth Dragon spoke in a gentle and apologetic tone.<br>The crowd was dumbstruck.<br>In particular, Zhou Shuang looked as if she had just eaten ten thousand flies. She couldn&rsquo;t believe that the Totem Nine Daoists were talking to Chu Feng in such a respectful manner.<br>Isn&rsquo;t Chu Feng supposed to be a wild child with no backing whatsoever?!<br>One had to understand that the Totem Nine Daoists were powerhouses in the Totem Galaxy. Even the Totem Dragon Clan had to show them some respect!<br>The ones who were the most flabbergasted by the development were none other than young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father and the others. Not even in their wildest imagination had they thought that the Totem Nine Daoists would step in and help Chu Feng!<br>Shoosh!<br>Daoist Sixth Dragon raised his hand and grabbed at the sky.<br>The next moment, young master Bai Yue, his father, the white-haired elder, and everyone else in the group lost their ability to fly and crashed onto the ground like heavy sandbags.<br>&ldquo;You spoke so much about backgrounds. Why don&rsquo;t you tell me who is backing you then?&rdquo; Daoist Sixth Dragon asked.<br>&ldquo;I-I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Before young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father could finish his sentence, a powerful oppressive might pressed them down onto the ground. Not even a Saint Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist was able to withstand his might.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother. They are bound to be small fry anyway,&rdquo; Daoist Sixth Dragon sneered.<br></div>
