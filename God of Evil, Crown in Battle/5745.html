        <h1>Chapter 5745: Fair And Square</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctant to admit defeat after the first blow, Qin Xuan continued making his moves, but he was unable to overcome Wang Qiang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is Wang Qiang that strong?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd discussed among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a formidable feat for any junior to reach rank six Half-God level. Only a small handful of people could achieve that feat. It was incredible how Wang Qiang was able to suppress Qin Xuan even though both of them were at rank six Half-God level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Qin Xuan has been suppressed. He can&rsquo;t defeat Wang Qiang.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder Wang Qiang, instead of the legendary </span><span>Yuwen</span><span> </span><span>Yanri</span><span>, was invited as the representative of the Divine Body Galaxy. He might be dressed weird, but his strength is the real deal.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmurs from the crowd and Wang Qiang&rsquo;s suppression frustrated Qin Xuan. He was a renowned prodigy, the face of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect. His name would drop into the gutters if he was defeated here. He would never be able to raise his head again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tremendous surge of aura rose from his body, raising his cultivation by a rank&mdash;rank seven Half-God level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aura changed, raising his cultivation by another rank&mdash;rank eight Half-God level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a tremendous oppressive might suddenly fell from the sky, freezing Wang Qiang and Qin Xuan in place. The oppressive might was specifically directed at the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Fight on the dueling ring if you have to. Are you looking down on my Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several figures stepped out from the white fog. The juniors quickly stepped aside to open a path for them to pass through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a group of monks, with a group of little monks trailing behind. These little monks were the ones who had brought the juniors to their respective residences when they first arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one leading the pack was a tall and brawny monk with stubble, looking young but mature. He held Buddhist praying beads in his right hand while forming a hand seal with his hand. One of the praying beads was glowing, emitting an aura similar to the oppressive might suppressing Wang Qiang and Qin Xuan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of these praying beads corresponded to a huge formation, and he was channeling one of them. Clearly, the oppressive might had come from one of these formations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng surprisingly recognized the tall and brawny monk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Liu Kuo?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, the Totem Dragon Clan hosted a tournament known as the Trial of the Strongest. Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> was deemed the strongest early Martial Exalted level cultivators, Chu Feng for late Martial Exalted level cultivators, Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> for early Half-God level cultivators, and Liu Kuo for late Half-God level cultivators.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liu Kuo was a monk, but he had a boisterous and interesting personality. He was strong, but he didn&rsquo;t put on airs at all. He was also not the type to fuss about formalities, unlike normal monks. Back then, Chu Feng thought that he was a decent person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could have thought that Liu Kuo would have such a background?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is he Master Nine Zenith&rsquo;s disciple?&rdquo; Chu Feng wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Liu Kuo&rsquo;s capabilities, his master had to be someone formidable too. His appearance here suggested that he was Master Nine Zenith&rsquo;s disciple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, considering the circumstances, Chu Feng chose not to acknowledge Liu Kuo so as to avoid compromising his neutrality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liu Kuo passed through the crowd and stepped into the middle of the square, becoming the center of attention. He retracted his hand seal, and the praying bead stopped glowing. At the same time, the oppressive might crushing Wang Qiang and Qin Xuan dissipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither Wang Qiang nor Qin Xuan intended to continue the battle anymore. They were in the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith, after all, and the person standing before them was in possession of such a formidable formation. It would be unwise for them to get careless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let me introduce myself. I am Liu Kuo, Master Nine Zenith&rsquo;s disciple. My master has recently gone into closed-door training, so it isn&rsquo;t convenient for him to show himself. Thus, I&rsquo;ll be taking charge of the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liu Kuo turned to Qin Shu and said, &ldquo;Qin Shu, you tried to collude with others to deal with the other participants of the competition, compromising the fairness of our Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith. You deserve a beating for what you have done.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words verified Feng Ling&rsquo;s earlier accusation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unwilling to accept the verdict, Qin Xuan questioned, &ldquo;How do you know what they said is true? Did you see what happened in person?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master Qin, we are in the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith. Nothing can elude my notice here. I am aware of everything you do and say in the public spaces, including voice transmissions,&rdquo; Liu Kuo said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Xuan shut his mouth. The formation of the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith was famous throughout the world of cultivation. Liu Kuo&rsquo;s words were most definitely credible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liu Kuo then turned to the crowd and continued, &ldquo;Please be assured that my surveillance is only limited to public spaces. You are guaranteed your safety and privacy in your private residences.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even glanced at Little Fishy, Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span>, Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span>, Feng Ling, and the other beauties, and said, &ldquo;Thus, you may bathe in peace without worrying about me peeping on you. I am a gentleman. I&rsquo;d have feigned ignorance even if I saw anything, not to mention that I can't see anything at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It should have been a friendly reminder from Liu Kuo, but something felt off about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng glanced at Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span>, and the latter shook her head with a faint smile. They had already known each other beforehand, so they knew that Liu Kuo wasn&rsquo;t an upright person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liu Kuo turned his attention back to Qin Xuan and said, &ldquo;Master Qin, you might have failed to keep your little brother in line, but that&rsquo;s your own family matter. However, you ignored all rhyme and reason to stand up for your little brother without getting to the bottom of things, assaulting someone in public without hesitation. I can&rsquo;t turn a blind eye to that. Qin Xuan and Qin Shu will be locked out of their residence for three </span><span>days, and no one is to take them in.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He channeled one of the prayer beads, and Qin Xuan and Qin Shu&rsquo;s residences were sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Liu Kuo was about to walk up to Chu Feng, Qin Xuan suddenly spoke up, &ldquo;Wait a moment.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master Qin, is there any problem?&rdquo; Liu Kuo asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll accept my punishment for having made a move in public, but he did the same too. Why didn&rsquo;t you punish him?&rdquo; Qin Xuan pointed at Wang Qiang and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master Qin, did you expect him to stand still and receive your attacks? Master Wang Qiang&rsquo;s action falls under the category of self-defense. It&rsquo;s perfectly understandable,&rdquo; Liu Kuo replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;W-w-w-well said!&rdquo; Wang Qiang shot a thumbs-up at Liu Kuo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master Wang Qiang, I&rsquo;m just upholding fairness here,&rdquo; Liu Kuo replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What about him beating up my little brother?&rdquo; Qin Xuan asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Your little brother was the one who stirred trouble. Master Wang Qiang&rsquo;s action can also be considered as self-defense here,&rdquo; Liu Kuo replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s considered self-defense too? You&hellip;&rdquo; Qin Xuan couldn&rsquo;t accept this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Liu Kuo interjected, &ldquo;Master Qin, the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith has its rules, and I am here to uphold them. You should abide by our rules too. If you&rsquo;re unable to do so, you are free to back out whenever you like.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Xuan was rendered speechless. What could he say against that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liu Kuo then walked up to Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd thought that Liu Kuo was going to question Chu Feng next since he was the root of the conflict. Much to their surprise, Liu Kuo raised his hand and smacked Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulder before flashing a radiant smile that exposed his white teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You sure hid it well! I&rsquo;d have never known that you&rsquo;re Elder Jie </span><span>Ranqing&rsquo;s</span><span> son!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone, with the exception of Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span>, was dumbfounded. In particular, Qin Xuan&rsquo;s complexion turned incredibly awful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liu Kuo obviously recognized Chu Feng too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They initially thought that Liu Kuo was a fair and neutral judge&hellip; but what were they supposed to make of this?</span></p></div>
