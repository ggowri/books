        <div>: Robbing Soul Power<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Gah!&rdquo;<br>Song Yun let out a heartrending cry of agony. There was no way a person could fake that.<br>Her body shuddered intensely as the soul power flowed out of her body. Her beautiful face distorted as she screamed, an indication of the tremendous suffering she was put under. Even her aura also became incredibly withered.<br>She was even facing the threat of death as a result of that.<br>&ldquo;Master! Yun&rsquo;er is young and ignorant. I should be taking the blame for failing to keep her hand! I know that she shouldn&rsquo;t have harmed Zi Ling, but she&rsquo;s my daughter. If you must punish someone, please punish me instead. I&rsquo;m willing to suffer on her behalf!<br>&ldquo;Master, please spare Yun&rsquo;er!&rdquo;<br>The Godwish Grandmother looked at Song Yun with tears streaming down her cheeks. She felt a sharp pain in her heart seeing the plight of her daughter.<br>But even so, she didn&rsquo;t fight against the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. She remained kneeling on the floor. She only pleaded for mercy, attempting to take the blame for herself.<br>It could be seen just how much she respected the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;In view that you haven&rsquo;t forgotten me, I&rsquo;ll spare her for today. However, whether she&rsquo;ll be able to survive this ordeal depends on herself,&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster said with a deep voice, as if there was a deeper meaning behind her words.<br>The Godwish Grandmother and<br>Lady of Dao Sea were planning to steal Zi Ling&rsquo;s soul power, but they were also sincere when they said that they didn&rsquo;t want to make Chu Feng their enemy. For that, the two of them went to elaborate lengths to set up a formation, and the Godwish Grandmother even brought out a treasure. This was to minimize the harm that would be dealt to Zi Ling.<br>Yet, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster forcefully sapped away Song Yun&rsquo;s soul power. This inflicted great damage on her body.<br>Even if the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster didn&rsquo;t plan to kill her, Song Yun would still lose her life if she failed to withstand the damage.<br>It was a while later before soul power stopped leaking from Song Yun&rsquo;s body. Her floating body slowly fell to the ground. She had stopped trembling, but the blood kept leaking from her mouth. Her body had already stiffened, making it look as if she was on the verge of death.<br>The Godwish Grandmother felt pained to see Song Yun&rsquo;s state, but she remained kneeling before the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, not daring to move.<br>&ldquo;Go and treat her,&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, master.&rdquo;<br>The Godwish Grandmother and<br>Lady of Dao Sea quickly rushed over to Song Yun&rsquo;s side to treat her.<br>As for Chu Feng, he had already rushed over to Shengguang Baimei&rsquo;s side and was working with Daoist Niantian to treat his injuries. It was fortunate that the Godwish Grandmother didn&rsquo;t make any serious attempt to take Shengguang Baimei&rsquo;s life, such that he wasn&rsquo;t in any danger despite his grievous injuries.<br>What Shengguang Baimei suffered wasn&rsquo;t worth a mention compared to Song Yun&rsquo;s state. With just a couple of pills and a short moment of treatment, he would be up and running.<br>On the other hand, Song Yun&rsquo;s breathing had grown faint. Even with the combined effort of the Godwish Grandmother and<br>Lady of Dao Sea, her condition still showed no sign of improving. On the contrary, her condition was worsening.<br>It looked like she really wouldn&rsquo;t be able to survive this crisis.<br>&ldquo;Yun&rsquo;er, you must hold on! You have to!&rdquo;<br>The Godwish Grandmother and<br>Lady of Dao Sea began crying. They could feel just how severe a state Song Yun was in.<br>Chu Feng also felt conflicted seeing Song Yun&rsquo;s state. He was angered by her action, but thinking about everything they had been through, he couldn&rsquo;t bear to see her current state.<br>It was just that there was nothing he could do to help her.<br>&ldquo;Give her this.&rdquo;<br>The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster tossed a jade bottle to the Godwish Grandmother. The latter quickly took it, uncapped it, and poured out dozens of white pills.<br>These pills had a clear appearance with a layer of white aura shrouding their surface. It was clear that they were no ordinary pills.<br>&ldquo;Feed her three first. With every passing hour, feed her another one,&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster ordered.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, master.&rdquo;<br>The Godwish Grandmother bowed deeply before following the instructions.<br>As soon as Song Yun swallowed the pills, her body started to be shrouded with the same white aura covering the surface of the pills. Her condition didn&rsquo;t improve, but it stopped worsening.<br>Thanks to that, the Godwish Grandmother and<br>Lady of Dao Sea were finally able to treat her. The effects were minimal, but at least Song Yun was safe for now. That put their hearts at ease.<br>&ldquo;I am Shengguang Baimei, an elder of the Holy Valley. Paying respects to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei walked over and greeted the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>His injuries weren&rsquo;t fully healed yet, but they didn&rsquo;t pose a problem anymore. He insisted on paying respects to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, so Daoist Niantian and Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t stop him.<br>By now, everyone was aware that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster was likely to be the mysterious individual who entered the Holy Valley together with Chu Feng back then.<br>To put it in other words, it was the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster who induced the proud Shengguang Baimei to kneel in fright and apologize to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Baimei, you sure changed quickly. I hope that your acknowledgment toward Chu Feng comes from the bottom of your heart. While Chu Feng isn&rsquo;t my closed-door disciple, he&rsquo;s still a disciple of our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Be it him or Zi Ling, I won&rsquo;t spare anyone who tries to hurt him,&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster warned.<br>She was openly acknowledging that she was the one who infiltrated the Holy Valley back then.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured. I did harbor other intentions at the start, fearing that young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s existence would threaten the position of our Holy Light Clan. However, after braving through dangers with him, I finally understand that he&rsquo;s the pride of our Holy Light Galaxy, as well as our future. I&rsquo;ll make sure to protect him even at the risk of my life. There&rsquo;s no way I would do anything that would endanger him,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>&ldquo;I can still hear the conceit in your words. It&rsquo;s called the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, not the Holy Light Galaxy. What rights does your Holy Light Clan have to rule the entire galaxy?&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster asked.<br>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei fell silent. There was shame on his face.<br>He understood what the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster was driving at. The Holy Light Clan did have a trump card known as the Holy Valley, but the truth was that the Holy Light Galaxy had never come anywhere close to the past glory of the Ancestral Martial Sect.<br>It had been steadily going downhill under their rule, to the point that it was now viewed as the weakest galaxy of the vast world of cultivation. Naturally, the one who ought to take responsibility for this failure was none other than the Holy Light Clan.<br>Shengguang Baimei was well aware of that.<br>Aside from that, the Holy Light Clan had never known much about the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, but they always thought that the latter was beneath them. However, Shengguang Baimei wasn&rsquo;t too sure about that now.<br>The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster felt unfathomably powerful to him, to the point that he couldn&rsquo;t tell whether their Holy Monarch would be able to defeat her.<br>Only the strongest power of the galaxy would have the mandate to rule, and the existence of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect cast doubt on the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s credence as the strongest power.<br>At the very least, it was clear that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect didn&rsquo;t recognize them as the overlord of the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>&ldquo;Wuuu!&rdquo;<br>Zi Ling suddenly let out a slight groan. She clutched her dantian and squatted down. Excruciating pain was spreading from her dantian to the rest of her body.<br></p></div>
