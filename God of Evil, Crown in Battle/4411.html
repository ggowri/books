        <div>: The Fear of the Dragon Clan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>Sensing the man&rsquo;s cultivation, even though Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s fury remained abated, a hint of astonishment surfaced in her eyes.<br>She hadn&rsquo;t thought that the disciple from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect would actually be this powerful.<br>One must know that as a rank six Utmost Exalted level cultivator, she could already be considered to be one of the more powerful cultivators of the younger generation, but the man before her was actually a rank eight Utmost Exalted level cultivator.<br>With such strength, he could compete for the title of the strongest cultivator of the younger generation in the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>What surprised Long Xiaoxiao even further was that she had never met or heard of this man before. For a complete nobody to possess such great power, it was inevitable that she would be surprised.<br>&ldquo;You really think that there&rsquo;s no one in our Dragon Clan? A mere rank eight Utmost Exalted level cultivator dares to fool around here?&rdquo; a furious bellow sounded.<br>It was Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother.<br>Weng!<br>Right after she said those words, a furious storm began to stir as an invisible power swept across the surroundings, causing even the sky to dim.<br>Rank one Martial Exalted level.<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother was actually a rank one Martial Exalted level cultivator!<br>She released her oppressive might and channeled it toward the man.<br>However, barely after her oppressive might approached the man, it suddenly fell flat as if a river surging into an ocean.<br>Upon seeing this sight, a frown formed on the forehead of Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother. Her experience was telling her that things weren&rsquo;t as simple as she thought it out to be.<br>Boom!<br>All of a sudden, a bizarre noise echoed from the sky. It sounded like the roar of the beasts and the rumbling of thunder mixed with one another.<br>And when everyone raised their eyes to take a look, shivers went down their spine.<br>There was a massive crack in the sky, and a golden shimmer was emanating from the crack.<br>The Dragon Clan encompassed huge swathes of land, but the golden light enveloped every single acre of land on the Dragon Clan.<br>The golden light had a divine vibe to it, and vaguely, one could even see the silhouette of a dragon amidst the light. It was a massive dragon, and it seemed to be coiling around the entire Dragon Clan.<br>The bizarre noise was growing clearer and clearer, and it didn&rsquo;t seem like it would disappear anything soon.<br>It was sounding more and more like a dragon&rsquo;s roar.<br>&ldquo;What a powerful phenomenon. Is that a divine dragon?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What happened for such a phenomenon to occur to our Dragon Clan?&rdquo;<br>Everything that was happening in the sky had alarmed everyone in the Dragon Clan. They looked at the sky with excited looks on their faces.<br>There were even some who kneeled down and kowtowed to show their respects to this divine sight.<br>The clan members of the Dragon Clan had the bloodline of the dragons flowing through their vein. Their bloodline might not have been pure, but it was their source of pride. Due to that, the members all viewed dragons as their gods.<br>So, when this phenomenon fell upon the Dragon Clan, everything thought that a fortuitous encounter had descended upon the Dragon Clan, and they were overjoyed by this happening.<br>Boom!<br>But all of a sudden, the golden light suddenly emanated a cold, deadly pressure that gripped at the hearts of those present, making them feel as if they were being brought right before death&rsquo;s door.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Sensing the change in the situation, the excitement on the faces of the members of the Dragon Clan vanished, replaced by shock and deep fear.<br>This pressure had delved right into the depths of their souls, leaving them feeling that they would lose their lives anytime soon.<br>More importantly, this pressure had not just affected the younger generation but even the older generation too.<br>Even Martial Exalted level experts like Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother were susceptible to the pressure too.<br>&ldquo;Senior Li, there&rsquo;s no need for you to do this. I, Yu Ting, am willing to take on the punishment for the crimes I have committed,&rdquo; Yu Ting said as she began walking toward the man.<br>But barely after taking two steps, someone pulled Yu Ting right back&mdash;Long Xiaoxiao.<br>This scene made the man narrow his eyes coldly.<br>&ldquo;Outsiders shouldn&rsquo;t interfere in the affairs of our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, or else you&rsquo;ll have to face the consequences!&rdquo; the man warned Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;If I insist on interfering, what can you do?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao replied vehemently.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if your Dragon Clan has the power to survive our fury then!&rdquo;<br>The eyebrows of the man shot up as wintry hostility flashed across his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Give it a try then!&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao replied as she prepared herself to make a move again.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, stop!&rdquo;<br>But at this very moment, a figure suddenly appeared before Long Xiaoxiao and forcefully suppressed her power.<br>It was no other than the strongest expert of the Dragon Clan, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief!<br>Long Xiaoxiao was relieved to see her father, and she immediately exclaimed, &ldquo;Father, this disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect dares to mess around in our Dragon Clan. We have to teach him a lesson!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, leave this matter to me to deal with.&rdquo;<br>As the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said those words, he turned to the sky above, clasped his fist, and said, &ldquo;That person above, you must be an expert of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Since you&rsquo;re already here, why don&rsquo;t you show yourself?&rdquo;<br>The words of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was not directed toward the disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect but the other person who was hiding in the area.<br>He was well aware that the frightening phenomenon that had covered the sky above the Dragon Clan couldn&rsquo;t have come from a mere disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. While the disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect might be relatively powerful amongst the younger generation, as a rank eight Utmost Exalted level cultivator, there was only so much that he could do.<br>Without a doubt, there was another expert from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect hiding somewhere around backing him.<br>However, no one responded to the question from the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Instead, the disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect sneered coldly and said, &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t worthy of meeting my grandfather!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The gall of your audacity!!!&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao was just about to berate the disciple when the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief suddenly placed a hand on her shoulder, and her words suddenly fell silent.<br>This was a mean of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. He was stopping Long Xiaoxiao from talking.<br>After that, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief turned to the disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect and said calmly, &ldquo;The young friend over there, Lady Yu Ting is an esteemed guest of our Dragon Clan. If you wish to take her away, you should at least give us a reasonable reason.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;She disobeyed our sect rules,&rdquo; the man replied.<br>Hearing those words, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief fell silent.<br>Not only so, but he even used his strength to make Long Xiaoxiao release her grip on Yu Ting, forcefully pulling them apart.<br>He had already made his decision, and that was to not interfere in this affair.<br>However, he couldn&rsquo;t be blamed for making such a decision either. It was not that he was a person without temper, but as the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, it was his duty to look at the bigger picture and decide the best course of action for the clan.<br>From the moment he saw the golden radiance and the vague silhouette of a dragon in the sky, as well as the frightening pressure it emanated that jolted even his heart, he knew that a formidable expert had arrived in the Dragon Clan.<br>He couldn&rsquo;t tell for certain whom the expert hiding in the sky was.<br>Based on what he knew, the sectmaster of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was a female, but the disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect claimed that the expert hiding in the sky was his grandfather.<br>If what he said was true, the person who had come today wasn&rsquo;t the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>But regardless of whom the expert hiding in the sky was, it was a fact that he wielded the strength to eradicate their Dragon Clan.<br>And the fact that the disciple called the expert hiding in the sky his grandfather showed that he was not just any disciple in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect either.<br>Putting all of this together, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief concluded that the matter was already way beyond what he could deal with, and interfering in this matter would simply be to the detriment of the Dragon Clan.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, thank you. However, I have already resolved myself to face this matter,&rdquo; Yu Ting looked at Long Xiaoxiao and said.<br>After that, she turned to the disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect and said, &ldquo;Senior Li, I&rsquo;ll return with you. I hope that you won&rsquo;t make things difficult for them.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, she began making her way toward the man.<br>Shoosh!<br>But at this very moment, a figure suddenly stood in Yu Ting&rsquo;s path, and this person was no other than Chu Feng!<br></p></div>
