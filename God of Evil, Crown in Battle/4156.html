        <h1>Chapter 4155</h1>
        <div> - Youth And Old Man<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng detected an aura. Furthermore, that aura was becoming more and more concentrated.<br>That was the aura of a treasure.<br>Although the treasure was not Dragon Vein Source Stone or Dragon Vein Blood Stone, it was still a treasure that could provide special benefits to the people of the Dragon Clan.<br>It was simply that treasures like those were generally very obscure.<br>Not to mention ordinary cultivators, it would be difficult for even Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists to detect the auras of that sort of treasure.<br>Yet, the situation at hand was extremely different.<br>Not only had Chu Feng detected its aura, anyone could detect its aura.<br>The aura was not hidden in the slightest. Instead, it was growing stronger and stronger.<br>It seemed as if it were deliberately tempting people to find it.<br>Although the situation was rather strange, Chu Feng would naturally be unwilling to miss out on such a treasure.<br>Besides, the treasure was extremely close to him.<br>Thus, Chu Feng began flying in the direction of the aura.<br>As his perception covered a rather wide radius, Chu Feng had managed to see everything before he arrived.<br>The thing emitting the aura was a stone.<br>That stone was the size of a fist. It had two different colors. Half of it was gold, and the other half was black.<br>Even though it was only a single stone, it was emitting an aura even more intense than the twenty-one Dragon Vein Blood Stones that Chu Feng had discovered earlier.<br>That said, the stone was not easily obtainable.<br>It was protected by a spirit formation.<br>Furthermore, that spirit formation was extremely powerful. Unless one had very strong world spirit techniques, one would not be able to handle it.<br>It could be said like this&hellip; If Chu Feng were to face the spirit formation, he could handle it without an issue.<br>But, if it were someone else, even if it were Grandmater Liangqiu, they would receive the spirit formation&rsquo;s backlash and die in the process.<br>Currently, an old man and a youth had experienced it first-hand.<br>Neither the old man nor the youth were able to handle the spirit formation. They were being swallowed by the protective formation.<br>They were currently struggling with all their might to break free.<br>&ldquo;Grandpa! Grandpa!&rdquo; The young man wailed nonstop.<br>The old man was shouting the youth&rsquo;s name too. Furthermore, his cheeks were streaming with tears.<br>The two of them were both in danger. But, they were not worried for their own safety, and were instead each worried about the other person.<br>From this, one could tell how good of a relationship the old man and his grandson had.<br>That old man not only had a missing arm, but his face was also covered in scars.<br>Those should be blade injuries.<br>It was not only the old man. The youth&rsquo;s face was also covered in scars.<br>He was even missing an eye and his entire nose.<br>Judging from his injury, his nose should&rsquo;ve been cut off by someone.<br>The two of them were both crippled; their injuries were also permanent.<br>Their souls were damaged. That was why their bodies were unable to recover.<br>Logically, Chu Feng was only a passerby. Furthermore, he was also interested in the stone.<br>If those two people were engulfed by the spirit formation, Chu Feng could openly seize the stone as his own.<br>But, after seeing the grandpa and grandson, Chu Feng became tenderhearted.<br>He did not wish to leave them for dead.<br>Thus, Chu Feng landed from above and set up a spirit formation.<br>With Chu Feng&rsquo;s help, the old man and his grandson were soon freed.<br>Not only that, but Chu Feng had also breached the protective formation and retrieved the stone.<br>&ldquo;Thank you benefactor, thank you benefactor.&rdquo;<br>After being rescued, the old man and the youth were both bowing to Chu Feng and expressing their thanks nonstop.<br>That said, Chu Feng noticed that whilst the youth was thanking him, he was also glancing at the black and gold stone in his hand nonstop.<br>Chu Feng saw longing in his gaze.<br>It was a desire that came from the bottom of one&rsquo;s heart, a pure feeling of thirst without the slightest bit of greed.<br>He deeply wanted that stone. He simply didn&rsquo;t dare express it.<br>After all, he knew that the stone had been obtained by Chu Feng, and should belong to him.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you&rsquo;re very interested in this stone,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor, that stone is capable of saving his father,&rdquo; said the old man.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was surprised to hear those words.<br>The old man then began to give an account of things to Chu Feng. With that, Chu Feng learned what had happened.<br>The old man and that youth were also amongst the people that had been abandoned by the Dragon Clan.<br>It was just that their clan had fallen into desolate straits long ago.<br>At present only three people remained.<br>They were the young man, the old man and the young man's father.<br>The young man's father was very powerful.<br>However he'd fallen ill all of a sudden. The cause of his illness was his bloodline. Because of that, it was very difficult to treat.<br>After his father fell ill, his cultivation ended up being sealed. With that, he'd practically turned into a disabled person.<br>When their enemies learned of this news, they immediately came seeking them out. Although they had not eradicated them, they'd left them humiliation that couldn't be forgotten.<br>The injuries on the youth and the old man; their missing body parts had all been caused by their enemies.<br>The name of the black and gold stone was Dragon Vein YinYang Stone. It was capable of curing his father&rsquo;s illness.<br>Actually, the youth and the old man did not come here for the sake of obtaining Dragon Vein Source Stone. Instead, they came to obtain the Dragon Vein YinYang Stone.<br>The Dragon Vein YinYang Stone was actually also a very rare treasure.<br>The reason why it would reveal itself and emit such an intense aura was because the youth and the old man had used a special treasure.<br>That was a treasure that could allow one to find a Dragon Vein YinYang Stone and force it to show itself.<br>Merely, they had not expected that, although they'd managed to successfully force the Dragon Vein YinYang Stone to reveal itself, their abilities were simply too weak, and they had failed to obtain it. Instead they had nearly been killed by its protective formation.<br>Fortunately, Chu Feng had appeared and rescued them.<br>Else, the old man and the youth would&rsquo;ve died.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor, you&rsquo;re not from the Dragon Clan, right?&rdquo; The young man asked Chu Feng all of a sudden.<br>However, he did not dare to even look at Chu Feng when he spoke. Timidness filled his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Mn. I am not from the Dragon Clan,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor, this Dragon Vein YinYang Stone is used to treat illnesses. It will not be able to increase one&rsquo;s bloodline power. Its only usage is to treat the illness that we from the Dragon Clan can get.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To benefactor, it should not be of any use. But to my father, it will be able to save him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have a presumptuous request. Benefactor, are you willing to sell this Dragon Vein YinYang Stone to me? I am willing to pay with everything that I have.&rdquo;<br>As the youth spoke, he took out his Cosmos Sack and handed it to Chu Feng.<br>Actually, Chu Feng was already moved after learning about the young man's experience. He had also become even more moved. So much that he felt sadness, after seeing the young man's actions.<br>The young man hadn&rsquo;t lied to him. Chu Feng could tell that even though the Dragon Vein YinYang Stone gave off a very powerful aura, it did not possess the ability to strengthen the Dragon Clan's bloodline power.<br>The reason why the Dragon Vein YinYang Stone gave off such a powerful aura was because it was a miracle elixir that was capable of treating injuries and illness.<br>Although it was a priceless treasure in its own right, it was of no use to Chu Feng and the already-recovered Long Daozhi.<br>Apart from that, the young man's Cosmos Sack had many precious treasures.<br>He most likely wasn't concealing anything. He had instead used all his possessions to try to purchase the Dragon Vein YinYang Stone from Chu Feng. That was more than sufficient to show how sincere he was.<br>Suddenly, a voice exploded, &ldquo;Trash like yourselves are not qualified to possess a treasure like that!&rdquo;<br>At the same time, two auras appeared.<br>With threatening nature, those auras rushed towards Chu Feng, the old man and the youth.<br></p></div>
