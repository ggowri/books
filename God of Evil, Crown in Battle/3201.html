        <h1>Chapter 3200</h1>
        <div> - A Possibility<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What Puyang Han and Puyang Qi wanted to do the most after arriving in the pagoda was to find Chu Feng and take care of him so as to appease the anger in their hearts.<br>However, they searched for Chu Feng on the second floor for a very long time to no avail. They did not discover any traces of him. After they arrived at the third floor, they actually still didn't find any traces of him.<br>Because of that, Puyang Han and Puyang Qi flew into a rage out of humiliation and began to shout insults at Chu Feng to lure him out. Unfortunately, their insults were akin to throwing stones into the sea, and received no response.<br>This caused Puyang Han and Puyang Qi to become even more displeased.<br>"Two young masters, it's better to forget about it. That Chu Feng might've already heard your voices, and merely doesn&rsquo;t dare to fight against you two, and thus decided to hide."<br>There were many people besides Puyang Han and Puyang Qi.<br>They were not all from the Puyang Heavenly Clan. In fact, the great majority of them were from other powers. Moreover, there were even geniuses from other regions.<br>That said, all of them felt their talent for martial cultivation and ability to be inferior to Puyang Han and Puyang Qi. Because of that, they wanted to hug Puyang Han and Puyang Qi's thighs and follow them to gain benefits from them. That was why they'd been flattering Puyang Han and Puyang Qi the entire time.<br>When they noticed that Puyang Han and Puyang Qi possessed enormous hatred for Chu Feng, they automatically decided to belittle Chu Feng too.<br>Right at that moment, someone from the crowd spoke slowly, "Chu Feng might not have necessarily hidden himself. There's actually another possibility."<br>Once that person spoke, everyone's expressions changed. Not to mention Puyang Han and Puyang Qi, even Li Anzhi, who was standing far away, turned his gaze toward that person.<br>In a place with geniuses like Li Anzhi, Puyang Han and Puyang Qi, that person looked very unremarkable.<br>However, that person was actually someone with extraordinary strength. He was the strongest newcomer from the Eastern Region's Dongguo Heavenly Clan.<br>Although his strength was inferior to Li Anzhi and the others, he, as the strongest newcomer from the Dongguo Heavenly Clan, had courage and insight.<br>Faced with the ill-intended gazes from the crowd, and especially from Puyang Han and Puyang Qi, that Dongguo Heavenly Clan's strongest newcomer did not show any fear. Instead, he calmly said, "Chu Feng might've already entered the New Excellence Formation's fourth floor."<br>"What? You said that Chu Feng might have already entered the New Excellence Formation's fourth floor? What sort of nonsense are you spouting?"<br>"That's right! Did you think that Chu Feng is truly an exceptional genius?"<br>However, after that Dongguo Heavenly Clan's strongest newcomer said those words, he was immediately met with ridicule and mockery from the crowd.<br>"Chu Feng is indeed an exceptional genius. When I first found out about him, I reacted in the same manner as you all, and didn&rsquo;t believe him to be an exceptional genius. In fact, I even felt disdain toward him."<br>"That's because I didn&rsquo;t believe that someone that was deemed to be trash incapable of martial cultivation and expelled from one's clan could become so powerful."<br>"However, after I personally heard what Chu Feng has accomplished from my senior's ears, after I personally witnessed that Chu Feng entering the New Excellence Formation with an unbelievable speed, no matter how I think about it, I have no choice but to accept that he&rsquo;s a genius."<br>"You can all refuse to believe my words now. However, one day, you&rsquo;ll come to believe my words," the Dongguo Heavenly Clan's strongest newcomer said.<br>He spoke those words in a very earnest manner. It was as if he had finally managed to speak his feelings.<br>At that moment, many people had startled expressions. At that moment, there were many people that believed that Dongguo Heavenly Clansman's words.<br>In fact, even Li Anzhi's expression turned complicated. The reason for that was because, compared to the others, he knew very well that Chu Feng was indeed a genius. If even Chu Feng could not be considered a genius, then he, Li Anzhi, could definitely not be considered a genius.<br>After all, Chu Feng had defeated him when his cultivation was an entire level below his.<br>If someone like him could not be considered to be a genius, Li Anzhi felt that there would not be many people in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield that could possibly be considered to be geniuses.<br>"And here I was thinking who it might be that would brag about that Chu Feng like that. Turns out, it's someone from the Dongguo Heavenly Clan."<br>"Humph, it&rsquo;s common knowledge that your Dongguo Heavenly Clan has had a friendly relationship with the Chu Heavenly Clan for many generations. However, even if that&rsquo;s the case, there shouldn't be a need for you to brag about that Chu Feng like this, no?"<br>"As the saying goes, whether mule or horse, one will know once one sees it. Didn't you say that Chu Feng is an exceptional genius? Very well, why don't you call him out? Why don't you tell him to stop hiding like a coward?"<br>Soon, someone indicated the extraordinary status between the Dongguo Heavenly Clan and the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Once that person said those words, many people came to a sudden realization, and felt that the Dongguo Heavenly Clansman was bragging about Chu Feng. As for why he was bragging about Chu Feng, it was simply too obvious. It was all because of the extraordinary relationship between the Dongguo Heavenly Clan and the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>At that moment, the crowd began to cast strange gazes at the Dongguo Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s newcomer. After they finished discussing among themselves in either whispers or loud voices, they all decided to ignore him.<br>Faced with the strange gazes from the crowd and some unpleasant words spoken by some of them, the Dongguo Heavenly Clan's strongest newcomer remained completely calm and composed.<br>He did not attempt to argue with the crowd. The reason for that was because he knew that reality would prove everything he said to be true.<br>As for the reality that he believed in, it was Chu Feng's strength.<br>"I feel that what this brother said is not without reason."<br>However, at the moment when everyone felt that the Dongguo Heavenly Clansman was bragging about Chu Feng, Li Anzhi's voice was suddenly heard.<br>After Li Anzhi's voice was heard, the crowd's expressions changed enormously. In fact, even the Dongguo Heavenly Clansmen's expression changed.<br>They did not understand why a genius like Li Anzhi would speak out for Chu Feng.<br>"Li Anzhi, what&rsquo;s the meaning of this? You couldn't possibly really be thinking that Chu Feng is capable of entering the New Excellence Formation's fourth floor by himself, right?" Puyang Han asked with a frown.<br>"I cannot be certain that he did that. However, I feel that it&rsquo;s a possibility," Li Anzhi said.<br></p></div>
