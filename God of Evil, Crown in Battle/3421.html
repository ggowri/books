        <div> - True Dragon World Spiritist<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After pondering for a moment, Grandmaster Liangqiu smiled and shook his head, &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s God-cloak, then forget about it. That is, after all, the highest realm that world spiritists can reach, according to legend.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only will it be impossible for this old man to achieve in my lifetime, even if I were given ten more lifetimes and were able to live for a hundred thousand years, I would likely still not have the chance to become one.&rdquo;<br>It was not without reason that Grandmaster Liangqiu said it like that.<br>After the Exalted realm was the Utmost Exalted realm.<br>After the Utmost Exalted realm was the Martial Exalted realm.<br>It was only after the Martial Exalted realm that one could reach the Half God realm.<br>The Half God realm was an unsurpassed cultivation realm. Those who reached that realm were existences that truly possessed the power of gods.<br>In order to reach the Half God realm from Utmost Exalted realm, what sort of talent, what sort of effort and what sort of opportunities must a martial cultivator possess?<br>Likely, no one in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield would dare to declare that they could become a Half God.<br>Not to mention Half God, even Martial Exalted would be out of reach and unthinkable.<br>The disparity between an Utmost Exalted and a Half God was akin to the disparity between a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist and God-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Although it seemed to only be the difference between a single realm, it was actually exceedingly distant.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, I&rsquo;ve heard that God-cloak World Spiritists possess power comparable to Half God-level martial cultivators. I wonder, is that really true?&rdquo; Queen Mother Fox Immortal asked.<br>&ldquo;The levels of world spiritists are separated into Insect Mark, Snake Mark and Dragon Mark.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, according to legend, once one reaches God-cloak World Spiritist, it will no longer be Insect Mark, Snake Mark and Dragon Mark.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead, one will be a Dragon Mark from the very start&hellip;&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu said.<br>&ldquo;Dragon Mark from the very start? In other words, God-cloak World Spiritists do not possess a difference in level?&rdquo; Queen Mother Fox Immortal asked.<br>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not the case. Not only are there different levels for God-cloak World Spiritists, but there are even more levels.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;From weak to strong, they are respectively&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;... White Dragon Mark, Gray Dragon Mark, Blue Dragon Mark, Purple Dragon Mark, Gold Dragon Mark, Royal Dragon Mark, Immortal Dragon Mark, Exalted Dragon Mark and Saint Dragon Mark,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually nine levels? Doesn&rsquo;t that just so happen to correspond to the nine ranks for martial cultivation realms?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, does it mean that God-cloak World Spiritists truly possess identical strength to Half God-level martial cultivators?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Queen Mother Fox Immortal and Wuming Xingyun both had astonished expressions on their faces.<br>They had been completely infatuated with world spirit techniques. Compared to martial cultivation, they were more fond of world spirit techniques.<br>Thus, to them, becoming a Half God-level martial cultivator was not as appealing as becoming a God-cloak World Spiritist.<br>However, they knew that it was widely known and accepted that world spiritists were inferior to martial cultivators.<br>If God-cloak World Spiritists truly possessed power on par with Half God-level martial cultivators, it would be very gratifying for them.<br>Although they felt that it would be impossible for them to reach that God-cloak realm in their lifetimes, it at least illustrated that as long as a world spiritist&rsquo;s level reached supremacy, they would be strong enough to contend against martial cultivators, and also possess god-like powers.<br>&ldquo;How can the two of you remain so calm?&rdquo; Suddenly, Queen Mother Fox Immortal looked at Liangqiu Chengfeng and Grandmaster Long Xuan.<br>Compared to Wuming Xingyun and her excitement, Liangqiu Chengfeng and Grandmaster Long Xuan did not have much of a reaction.<br>&ldquo;I am able to understand Liangqiu Chengfeng. After all, he has followed Grandmaster Liangqiu since he was young. Thus, it would not be surprising if he knows what Grandmaster Liangqiu knows.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Long Xuan, why are you pretending to be calm? Are you saying that you already knew about all these things?&rdquo; Queen Mother Fox Immortal looked at Grandmaster Long Xuan with a look of contempt.<br>What Grandmaster Liangqiu had told them, was something that they&rsquo;d asked him all the time in the past, only for him to refuse to reveal it to them.<br>The reason why Grandmaster Liangqiu was willing to tell them about those things, was purely because he was in a cheerful mood.<br>Thus, to them, God-cloak World Spiritist was a very mysterious realm that they had absolutely no understanding of.<br>Since even she did not understand it, Queen Mother Fox Immortal naturally felt that Grandmaster Long Xuan also didn&rsquo;t understand it.<br>&ldquo;Did you think that everyone would be as ignorant as you, and not know about common knowledge like this?&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan looked to Queen Mother Fox Immortal and smiled. His smile was very mocking.<br>&ldquo;Oh-ho, aren&rsquo;t you high-spirited? In that case, why don&rsquo;t you tell me where you learned about those things?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you tell me you learned it from Grandmaster Liangqiu, for it would be impossible for Grandmaster Liangqiu to tell you these things. It would also be impossible for Liangqiu Chengfeng to be the one,&rdquo; Queen Mother Fox Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mention it in the past because I feared that I might end up misguiding you all. After all, they were merely hearsay for me too. I didn&rsquo;t know if they were true or not,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu explained.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, you don&rsquo;t have to overthink it. What you said&hellip; is the truth. God-cloak World Spiritists do indeed possess the power to contend against Half God-level martial cultivators,&rdquo; Compared to Grandmaster Liangqiu, Grandmaster Long Xuan was extremely certain as he spoke.<br>&ldquo;What makes you so certain?&rdquo; Queen Mother Fox Immortal rolled her eyes at Grandmaster Long Xuan.<br>&ldquo;Not only am I certain, if I must be frank, I might even know more than Grandmaster Liangqiu,&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan said.<br>Hearing those words, in addition to Queen Mother Fox Immortal and the others, even Grandmaster Liangqiu looked at Grandmaster Long Xuan with a change in expression.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Long Xuan, you really know more about God-cloak World Spiritists?&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu seemed to be very interested in God-cloak World Spiritists.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, how could you believe his words?&rdquo; Queen Mother Fox Immortal laughed.<br>&ldquo;I am telling the truth. Grandmaster&hellip; what you know are rumors, whereas what I know is extremely reliable,&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan said.<br>&ldquo;Very well, why don&rsquo;t you tell us about it then?&rdquo; Queen Mother Fox Immortal looked to Grandmaster Long Xuan with a mocking gaze.<br>&ldquo;Did you not discover that the nine levels of God-cloak World Spiritist just so happen to correspond to White-cloak, Gray-cloak, Blue-cloak, Purple-cloak, Gold-cloak, Royal-cloak, Immortal-cloak, Exalted-cloak and Saint-cloak, the world spiritist realms that world spiritists have had to journey through?&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan asked.<br>&ldquo;Is there even a need for you to mention that? Who couldn&rsquo;t tell?&rdquo; Queen Mother Fox Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;Then, here&rsquo;s the issue. Since there&rsquo;s White Dragon Mark all the way till Saint Dragon Mark, where&rsquo;s God Dragon Mark?&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan asked.<br>&ldquo;How would I know? It&rsquo;s not like I know anything about God-cloak World Spiritists. Since you said you know, why don&rsquo;t you let us hear it?&rdquo; Queen Mother Fox Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;The answer is very simple. God-cloak World Spiritist is not the strongest realm a world spiritist can reach. There&rsquo;s another realm above God-cloak,&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan said.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Hearing those words, not only did Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others&rsquo; eyes brighten, but even Queen Mother Fox Immortal, who didn&rsquo;t believe Grandmaster Long Xuan, revealed an interested look in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another realm above God-cloak?&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu questioned.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, there is indeed another realm above God-cloak. It is a realm capable of contending against True God-level martial cultivators,&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan said.<br>&ldquo;What sort of realm is it?&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu asked.<br>&ldquo;True Dragon World Spiritist,&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan said.<br></p></div>
