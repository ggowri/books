        <h1>Chapter 2770</h1>
        <div> - Playing Chess Against Han Yu<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Like firecrackers, the sound of slapping began to resonate through the palace hall.<br>If one were to have just entered this palace and did not understand the situation, they would definitely be extremely astonished.<br>Yuwen Hualong, a rank six True Immortal, was actually kneeling before a rank one True Immortal and allowing that rank one True Immortal to slap his face without uttering a single word. This was truly astonishing.<br>Fortunately, as Li Xiang was a rank one True Immortal, no matter how much strength he put behind his slaps, he was unable to cause any damage to Yuwen Hualong.<br>This was the profoundness of martial cultivation. When the disparity between two cultivators was too enormous, one would simply not be able to cause any damage to one&rsquo;s opponent.<br>It was precisely because of this enormous disparity that cultivators would disregard everything to attain higher levels of cultivation.<br>That said, even though Yuwen Hualong was not feeling any pain from Li Xiang&rsquo;s slaps, he was most definitely feeling a fiery pain to his face. [1. The face here is not literal.]<br>What he had lost today was his dignity.<br>To him, this was humiliation.<br>Ten thousand slaps. That was not a small number at all.<br>Fortunately, Li Xiang was very fast with his slaps. In merely a short moment, all ten thousand slaps landed on Yuwen Hualong&rsquo;s cheeks.<br>After the slaps all landed, there was no trace of injury on Yuwen Hualong&rsquo;s face. The only thing present was anger.<br>Instead, it was Li Xiang&rsquo;s palms that had turned deep red and were greatly swollen.<br>However, Li Xiang was feeling extremely pleased.<br>A single word was written on his face: relief.<br>After the ten thousand slaps were given, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder released Yuwen Hualong.<br>At that moment, Yuwen Hualong was like a volcano on the verge of eruption. He was looking at Li Xiang and seemingly wanting to bite him to pieces.<br>However, he had no choice but to restrain his anger. After all, he knew very well that if he were to attack Li Xiang here, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder would definitely make him suffer.<br>After all, when that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder stood forward to uphold fairness, he had revealed his standpoint. That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder was discriminating in favor of Chu Feng and the others.<br>Due to the fact that Yuwen Hualong was unable to erupt in anger even though he was extremely furious, he started to feel extremely sullen.<br>&ldquo;Brat, remember this. Today, you&rsquo;ve done what you should&rsquo;ve never done.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You will regret this one day.&rdquo;<br>Yuwen Hualong pointed at Li Xiang and spoke fiercely.<br>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; Li Xiang actually snorted at Yuwen Hualong disdainfully. Then, filled with confidence, Li Xiang said to Yuwen Hualong, &ldquo;You should also remember this. What your daddy did here today is the most satisfying fucking thing ever. Your daddy will absolutely not regret this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Yuwen Hualong said with rage fuming between gritted teeth.<br>After saying those words, he shot a fierce and threatening gaze at Li Xiang.<br>However, Yuwen Hualong did not say anymore. Instead, he turned around and walked over to Yuwen Tingyi and Han Yu.<br>At that moment, both Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi were revealing very malevolent expressions. Their expressions were somewhat frightening. It was as if they were not humans at all, but rather ferocious beasts with an enormous desire to eat people.<br>Intense anger filled their eyes. Anyone could tell how furious and unreconciled they were.<br>Because of this, even though the crowd wanted to ridicule them, very few people dared to actually say anything. They were all secretly sending voice transmissions to each other in private.<br>However, even though the great majority of people were afraid of Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi, that did not mean that everyone present was afraid of them.<br>Take for example the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan. They were not afraid of Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi. At that moment, they did not try to conceal their conversations at all. Openly, before everyone, they began to use disdainful tones to insult Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi.<br>They were insulting the two of them for overestimating their capabilities, only to court their own humiliation.<br>However, this was normal too. After all, it was Yuwen Tingyi who had suggested the game of chess. It was also Yuwen Tingyi who had put forth the bet of slapping one&rsquo;s face should one lose.<br>The disgrace Yuwen Tingyi and Yuwen Hualong were suffering from right now was merely the consequences of their own actions.<br>Faced with the Chu Heavenly Clansmen&rsquo;s insults and humiliations, not to mention Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi, not even Han Yu, one of the very few demon-level geniuses in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, was able to say anything.<br>Thus, they were furious. The more they thought about it, the more sullen they became.<br>&ldquo;Young master Han Yu,&rdquo; right at that moment, a gentle voice was heard.<br>Once that voice was heard, Han Yu&rsquo;s heart was immediately shaken. He immediately became spirited.<br>The reason for that was because that voice was from the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter, Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xia, is there something you need?&rdquo; Han Yu revealed an eagerly attentive smile.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that young master Han Yu&rsquo;s chess skills are also extremely excellent. We have all witnessed young master Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess skills. Young master Han Yu, why don&rsquo;t you swap pointers with young master Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I think that if the two of you are to swap pointers with one another, it would most definitely be extremely marvelous. We would also be able to feast our eyes,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;This damned girl, how could she be this abominable? She is simply unable to tolerate you doing well for yourself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve merely taken her bits of natural energy. Is there really a need for her to loathe you like this?&rdquo;<br>Once Xia Yun&rsquo;er said those words, Her Lady Queen was immediately furious. Her face started to bulge angrily.<br>The reason for that was because Xia Yun&rsquo;er was simply being too excessive. Ever since she had arrived, she&rsquo;d been deliberately inciting disharmony between Chu Feng and Han Yu.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng and Han Yu were simply unable to tolerate one another. All of this was because of Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>Her Lady Queen did not anticipate that Xia Yun&rsquo;er would still not let Chu Feng get away, and was still planning to create trouble for Chu Feng.<br>Most importantly, Chu Feng had already given her his golden glass ball.<br>Yet, not only was Xia Yun&rsquo;er unappreciative, but she actually still targeted Chu Feng. With this, how could Her Lady Queen not be furious?<br>It was only because Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s current strength was insufficient. If not for that, she would most definitely demand that Chu Feng let her out so that she could personally tear up Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s mouth.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, it&rsquo;s alright. I instead want to see exactly what Xia Yun&rsquo;er is planning to do.&rdquo;<br>Compared to Her Lady Queen, Chu Feng was rather calm and collected.<br>Hearing what Xia Yun&rsquo;er said, a joyous expression emerged in Han Yu&rsquo;s eyes. He looked to Chu Feng as if he had managed to grasp an opportunity to get revenge against him.<br>&ldquo;Actually, I also wish to swap pointers against brother Chu Feng. Merely&hellip; I am, after all, a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, whereas brother Chu Feng is still only a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I was merely afraid that brother Chu Feng would not dare to swap pointers with me. That is why I did not put forth this request.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Han Yu already knew that I wouldn&rsquo;t dare even without making the request?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Are you to say that you dare to accept?&rdquo; Han Yu asked.<br>&ldquo;Had it been someone else, I might not be daring enough to accept their challenge. However, as for you, I just so happen to not be afraid,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words were like a thunderstrike. All of the people present were extremely shocked by his words.<br>What was this? A Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist wanted to contend against a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?<br>This was simply too irrational. After all, one would have no chance of winning in such a confrontation.<br>After all, even against Yuwen Tingyi and Yuwen Hualong, Chu Feng had only managed to barely win.<br>If he were to contend against a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, then he would simply have no chance of victory at all.<br>The crowd was truly unable to understand what Chu Feng was thinking to actually say that sort of thing.<br>Not to mention the others, even Her Lady Queen was very astonished.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what are you doing? Even if you are unable to bear the anger, you shouldn&rsquo;t accept such a challenge. This is simply too unfair of a match,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said to Chu Feng. She wanted to urge Chu Feng to not play a round of chess against Han Yu.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, trust me this once. I am definitely not doing this out of impulse,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; forget about it. Do as you want,&rdquo; in the end, Her Lady Queen reached a compromise.<br>At that moment, Han Yu asked, &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, are you serious?&rdquo;<br>Originally, he had thought that Chu Feng would definitely not answer his challenge. Never did he expect that Chu Feng would actually accept the match.<br>With such a great opportunity before him, Han Yu would definitely grasp it. Even if he was to be declared to have an unfair advantage by others, he must still defeat Chu Feng.<br>Else, he would be left feeling extremely stifled by the anger in his heart today.<br>&ldquo;I am naturally serious,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied calmly.<br>&ldquo;It seems that you&rsquo;re very confident. Could it be that you really think you can defeat me?&rdquo; Han Yu asked.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng did not answer him. Instead, he chuckled lightly. It was a very confident chuckle.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s chuckle answered Han Yu&rsquo;s question. Chu Feng indeed felt that he would be able to defeat Han Yu.<br>At that moment, the crowd, including even that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder, all revealed gazes of anticipation.<br>That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder did not feel that Chu Feng was an impulsive person. Since he dared to accept the match, he surely possessed certainty of victory.<br>Merely, the disparity between a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist and a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist was simply too enormous.<br>Exactly how was Chu Feng going to face Han Yu?<br>It was precisely because he did not understand how Chu Feng was hoping to accomplish this that he was anticipating the upcoming match.<br><br><br>Check out the June Giveaway for a chance to win $200, $100 or $50 Visa Gift Card<br><br></p></div>
