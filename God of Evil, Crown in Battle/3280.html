        <div> - Fired Up<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Xuanyuan also managed to activate seven Bloodline Cultivation Formations,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Father was actually on par with grandfather. Amazing.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt very delighted. Both his grandfather and his father had left behind legends of their own in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. Furthermore, both of them were the strongest geniuses that no one could match in their respective eras.<br>However, as they were not from the same era, one could only make guesses to evaluate their talent.<br>There were many different sorts of sayings in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>The people of the older generation all felt that Chu Hanxian was stronger. The reason for that was because they had personally witnessed Chu Hanxian&rsquo;s unparalleled might, personally experienced his era.<br>However, those of the younger generation, such as Chu Xuanzhengfa, instead felt that Chu Xuanyuan was stronger. Their reasoning was very simple. They too had witnessed Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s unparalleled might.<br>However, Chu Feng felt that it was very difficult to guess as to whether his grandfather or his father was stronger. After all, both his grandfather and his father were people that he admired greatly.<br>That said, should he be able to choose their strength, he would rather they be equally matched, equally powerful.<br>And now, the result provided to him by the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was precisely what he wanted.<br>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; However, right at that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief opened his mouth again.<br>Seeing the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief hesitation, Chu Feng hurriedly asked, &ldquo;Senior, but what?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, your father nearly managed to activate the eighth Bloodline Cultivation Formation. Merely, he only managed to successfully activate half of the eighth Bloodline Cultivation Formation. In the end, the eighth Bloodline Cultivation Formation gradually stopped its activation. That is why I said he only managed to activate seven Bloodline Cultivation Formations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for your grandfather, he only managed to activate seven Bloodline Cultivation Formations, and showed no sign of activating the eighth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I cannot say that Xuanyuan&rsquo;s talent surpassed that of your grandfather, I can say that your father benefited more from the Bloodline Altar than your grandfather,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such a thing? Father is truly amazing,&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s blood started to boil upon hearing the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s words.<br>It was as the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had said, it would be impossible to determine if Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s talent was truly stronger than Chu Hanxian&rsquo;s with a single Bloodline Altar. However, the result of the Bloodline Altar revealed that Chu Xuanyuan should&rsquo;ve gained more comprehension inside it compared to Chu Hanxian.<br>With this, it could be said that Chu Xuanyuan had surpassed his father.<br>Chu Feng, as Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son and Chu Hanxian&rsquo;s grandson, now had two very difficult peaks before him to surmount. Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan were Chu Feng&rsquo;s pride. At the same time, they were existences that he wished to surpass.<br>Right now, an opportunity to measure himself against his grandfather and father had finally appeared before him. With this, he was unable to help himself from becoming excited.<br>&ldquo;Xuanyuan is truly worthy of being deemed an exceptional genius,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief smiled and nodded.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng asked, &ldquo;Senior, this is strange. Didn&rsquo;t you say that only the people of the younger generation within a hundred years of age were able to activate the Bloodline Altar? Our Old Ancestor had already left the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm at that time. Could it be that he was still only a person of the younger generation that was less than a hundred years old?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Indeed, our Old Ancestor was no longer a person of the younger generation at that time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, don&rsquo;t forget that the mysterious excellency that created the Bloodline Altar was also present with our Old Ancestor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With that person there, the rules could be altered,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng came to a realization upon hearing the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s explanation.<br>Then, unable to contain himself, Chu Feng gasped in admiration at how powerful that mysterious excellency was.<br>Suddenly, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s a thing that I must tell you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, please speak away,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Both your grandfather and your father told me the same thing after they came out from the Bloodline Altar. They said that after entering the Bloodline Altar, those with low comprehensive ability would only be able to gain martial comprehension. Even if they were able to increase their cultivation, it would not be a strengthening of their bloodline&rsquo;s power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if someone with exceptional talent were to enter it, not only would they be able to gain martial comprehension, but they would also be able to comprehend their bloodline&rsquo;s power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As the saying goes, a person cannot focus on two things simultaneously. That is even more so inside the Bloodline Altar.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, should you encounter a situation where you must choose between gaining martial comprehension or comprehending your bloodline&rsquo;s power, you must definitely choose your bloodline&rsquo;s power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With your talent, you will, sooner or later, increase your cultivation. However, to strengthen one&rsquo;s bloodline&rsquo;s power is extremely difficult to accomplish. This is not my advice for you. Instead, it is the advice that your grandfather and father left for our Chu Heavenly Clansmen. Do you understand?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;This junior understands,&rdquo; Chu Feng firmly engraved this in his mind.<br>Actually, back when Chu Feng climbed the Heavenly Lightning Steps and was struck by the heavenly lightning from the highest heavens when he reached the tenth step, Chu Feng obtained a very powerful technique.<br>That technique was called the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes.<br>The Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes was not a martial skill, an Immortal Technique or a secret skill.<br>The reason for that was because it was so heaven-defying that martial skills, Immortal Techniques and secret skills were simply incomparable to it.<br>The Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes had a total of nine slashes. Each slash was more difficult than the last. However, the might of each successive slash was also more powerful than the last.<br>Should one master the first slash, one would be able to kill experts a level of cultivation stronger than oneself.<br>From this, it was obvious how frightening the power of the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes was should one be able to completely master it.<br>However, even now, Chu Feng had yet to manage to grasp even the first slash of the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes.<br>In the past, Chu Feng had thought that he might be able to learn the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes after reaching the Martial Immortal realm.<br>However, after reaching the Martial Immortal realm, Chu Feng discovered that the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes not only had a requirement in terms of cultivation, but it also had an enormous requirement for one&rsquo;s control over one&rsquo;s bloodline power.<br>With Chu Feng&rsquo;s current control over his bloodline power, he would still not be able to learn the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes.<br>That said, Chu Feng felt that the Bloodline Altar might be an opportunity for him.<br>Should it really be as his grandfather and father had said, should the Bloodline Altar really be able to allow one to gain comprehension to strengthen one&rsquo;s bloodline power, then perhaps Chu Feng would be able to master the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes after all.<br>To Chu Feng, this would be an exceptionally good opportunity. Perhaps it would be an opportunity he would not be able to encounter again.<br>&ldquo;Senior, when can I enter the Bloodline Altar?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>The current Chu Feng was itching to enter the Bloodline Altar.<br>This was not only a challenge toward his father and his grandfather, but it was also a challenge for himself.<br>This challenge was extremely difficult. However, it was also precisely because of its difficulty that Chu Feng was itching to undergo it.<br>&ldquo;Are you prepared?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m prepared,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, we can begin tomorrow,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br></p></div>
