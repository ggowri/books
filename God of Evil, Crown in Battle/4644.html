        <h1>Chapter 4643</h1>
        <div>: The Asura Blood Tribe<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;This feeling&hellip; An Asura Spirit World&rsquo;s world spirit?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could immediately tell that the being who had just released the black aura was an Asura Spirit World&rsquo;s world spirit.<br>As it turned out, Gongsun Yuntian was also an Asura World Spiritist.<br>Asura World Spiritists were rare existences in the world, but if one were to look at it at the scale of the massive world of cultivation, the number of Asura World Spiritists wasn&rsquo;t so few as to be considered legendary existences.<br>Nevertheless, it was hard to stumble onto one, which was why Chu Feng always felt excited whenever he encountered an Asura World Spiritist.<br>However, the circumstances were a little different here. The fact that the black aura was able to knock back Yu Sha showed that this world spirit was powerful too.<br>This was definitely no good news for Yu Sha and Chu Feng<br>&ldquo;Ki ki ki ki&hellip; Gongsun Yuntian, aren&rsquo;t you a despicable one? You actually made me hit a young lass?&rdquo;<br>A deep and arrogant voice sounded from the spirit formation gate.<br>Pah!<br>Following that, a large hand shot out from the spirit formation gate and grabbed the sides of the gate. This hand bore resemblance to that of a human&rsquo;s, but it was far larger than any human man could be. This showed that the master of the hand must be gigantic in size as well.<br>Following the hand, the world spirit&rsquo;s main body also climbed out from the spirit formation gate too.<br>This world spirit was shrouded in black aura, making it impossible to discern his true appearance. From its silhouette, one could tell that this world spirit had a humanoid form.<br>Its height which towered at 10 meters tall, as well as its massive silhouette, made it a massive giant. It was considered to be small by the standards of demonic creatures, but it was indubitably humongous compared to a human.<br>Boom!<br>As soon as this world spirit appeared, the massive dueling ring began to tremor ever so slightly. As this dueling ring was simply that huge, even the spectator stand and the VIP area weren&rsquo;t spared from the tremoring too.<br>In fact, along with the tremoring, some of the formation runes on the dueling ring began to glow brightly. Then, a thin layer of black aura began to flow out, shrouding the exterior of the dueling ring.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was taken aback.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a phenomenon. It looks like young friend Yuntian has quite an extraordinary world spirit, possibly from a notable background,&rdquo; the Wretched Black Demon explained.<br>As he spoke those words, he turned to look at Gongsun Yuntian with a hint of rare approval in his eyes.<br>Those words made the crowd come to a realization. It turned out that it was the world spirit triggering a phenomenon.<br>One must know that Chu Feng&rsquo;s powerful female world spirit had come from the Asura Spirit World too, but her arrival hadn&rsquo;t incurred any phenomenon. Yet, Gongsun Yuntian&rsquo;s world spirit actually managed to do it.<br>This showed that Gongsun Yuntian&rsquo;s world spirit was even stronger than Yu Sha.<br>&ldquo;Good job, Gongsun Yuntian! As expected of the most talented junior world spiritist of our Nine Souls Galaxy!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Yuntian, you didn&rsquo;t let this old man down!&rdquo;<br>Compliments roared from the spectator stand all around. The morale of the crowd had been repressed for too long, but Gongsun Yuntian&rsquo;s comeback brought renewed excitement to them all.<br>Gongsun Yuntian was one of the representative figures of the Nine Souls Galaxy, and the fact that he was defeated by a world spiritist from the lowly Holy Light Galaxy didn&rsquo;t sit well with them. As such, his comeback came as a huge relief to the crowd.<br>Boom!<br>The world spirit raised his leg and stomped down furiously. A powerful shockwave rippled outward, scattering all of the black aura shrouding it.<br>With this, the true form of the world spirit which induced the earlier phenomenon was finally revealed.<br>This world spirit was dressed in only a simple pair of pants. He had a bulky physique, and due to the lack of clothes, one could see his muscles clearly. Not only were they massive, but they looked as tough as granite too. No one would dare to underestimate the burst strength of that body.<br>Aside from that, the world spirit was also very hairy. His hair covered his entire body, including his face, making him look like a massive black lion. While his face was mostly covered in hair, from the rough outline of his face, one could still tell that he was extremely ugly.<br>Compared to the beautiful Yu Sha, he looked like a complete beast.<br>However, what stood out the most was his blood-red eyes that were terrifying to behold, making him even more frightening than any beast.<br>On the whole, he had an appearance that would instill fear in anyone standing before him.<br>&ldquo;Blood Tribe?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the blood-red eyes of the world spirit, Yu Sha seemed to have thought of something, causing her to blurt out those two words.<br>&ldquo;Blood Tribe? Does that refer to the Asura Blood Tribe? Gongsun Yuntian actually managed to tame a world spirit from the Asura Blood Tribe?&rdquo;<br>The words &lsquo;Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo; immediately changed everyone&rsquo;s perception of that world spirit.<br>&ldquo;He really is from the Asura Blood Tribe. Young friend Yuntian, you&rsquo;re truly an incredible individual.&rdquo;<br>After a careful assessment, some of the older world spiritists finally affirmed the origin of the world spirit and lavished praises on Gongsun Yuntian once more.<br>The realization that a junior world spiritist of the Nine Souls Galaxy had managed to accomplish so much left them feeling so excited that they could hardly conceal the fervent look on their faces.<br>&ldquo;Xia Yan, do you know of the origins of the Asura Blood Tribe?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t too familiar with that phrase, but he didn&rsquo;t want to disturb Yu Sha from the battle, so he turned to Xia Yan and began enquiring about it.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know about the Asura Blood Tribe? How in the world did you even become an Asura World Spiritist?!&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan first shot a look at disdain at Chu Feng before finally explaining about the Asura Blood Tribe.<br>The Asura Blood Tribe, as its name suggested, referred to a certain tribe originating from the Asura Spirit World. The members of the Asura Blood Tribe possessed a unique bloodline, and their blood-red eyes were indicative of their identity.<br>If one were to view Divine Powers and Heavenly Bloodline as the &lsquo;nobles&rsquo; of ordinary cultivators, the Asura Blood Tribe would indubitably be the &lsquo;&rsquo;nobles&rsquo; of the Asura Spirit World&rsquo;s world spirits.<br>Without a doubt, those of the Asura Blood Tribe possessed unimaginable strength, but at the same time, they were incredibly arrogant too. Due to that, very few of them were willing to submit to world spiritists.<br>There were many legends about the Asura Blood Tribe going around in the Nine Souls Galaxy, but there were very few known cases where a world spiritist had managed to tame a world spirit of the Asura Blood Tribe.<br>That was also the reason why the powerhouses gathered here were so excited to learn that Gongsun Yuntian had actually managed to tame a world spirit of the Asura Blood Tribe.<br>&ldquo;Ki ki ki! Young lass, I have struck plenty of women during my time in the Asura Spirit World, but I have never laid my hands on someone as beautiful as you before. You happen to be the type I like. Ahhh, I really can&rsquo;t bring myself to hit you.&rdquo;<br>The world spirit eyed Yu Sha licentiously as he spoke with a tone as if everything was in his control. It was almost as if Yu Sha was his to toy around with.<br>&ldquo;Yu Sha, are you confident in dealing with him? If not, come back right away. Don&rsquo;t force yourself,&rdquo; Chu Feng told Yu Sha through voice transmission.<br>However, Yu Sha didn&rsquo;t bother responding to Chu Feng. Instead, her eyes remained focused on the world spirit before her.<br>&ldquo;You sure speak a lot of nonsense. Just cut the crap and fight.&rdquo;<br>Shoosh!<br>Yu Sha immediately morphed into a black shadow, flitting straight for that Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit.<br>However, that world spirit stood completely still on the spot, waiting patiently for Yu Sha to arrive without bothering to make any moves at all.<br>Yu Sha didn&rsquo;t stand on ceremony either. She pushed her black swords forth, one aiming for world spirit&rsquo;s chest and the other one slashing sideward at the world spirit&rsquo;s head.<br>Shoosh shoosh!<br>At that critical moment, the world spirit suddenly reached out to grab Yu Sha&rsquo;s black aura sword with his bare hands.<br>A shocking sight happened afterward.<br>Yu Sha&rsquo;s sword actually came to a complete halt before the hands of the Blood Asura Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit, leaving not even a cut on him!<br></p></div>
