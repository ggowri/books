        <h1>Chapter 3275</h1>
        <div> - Opening Of The Mysterious Treasure Diagram<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Never would I have expected such a little stone to be able to allow you to train for so long.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My dear Eggy, being unable to hear your voice beside my ears, I am truly feeling an indescribable sense of loneliness.&rdquo;<br>Slightly tipsy, Chu Feng walked over to Eggy and extended his hand to gently stroke Eggy&rsquo;s exceptionally beautiful face.<br>However, before his hand touched Eggy, it suddenly stopped. Then, Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand slowly pulled back.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng looked at Eggy and smiled awkwardly.<br>Actually, Chu Feng had had quite a lot of intimate contact with Eggy.<br>However, Chu Feng felt that it was unsuitable for him to act like that whilst Eggy was unaware.<br>In terms of relationships, it would be very difficult to find another person that had such a close relationship with Chu Feng in the entire world.<br>Even though Chu Feng loved Zi Ling dearly, there was still some difference in certain aspects when compared to his feelings for Eggy.<br>After all, Eggy had accompanied Chu Feng from the very start. She had instructed him like both a teacher and a friend, and had risked life and limb to protect him.<br>From the time of the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm&rsquo;s Azure Dragon School, Chu Feng had traversed so many different places, made so many cultivation breakthroughs, surpassed so many people and experienced so much danger.<br>During those times, the people beside Chu Feng, his benefactors, his friends and his enemies, were changing nonstop. Only Eggy continued to accompany him.<br>The feelings between them were truly enormously deep.<br>In terms of closeness, Eggy was most definitely the person Chu Feng was the closest with.<br>That said, the relationship between Eggy and Chu Feng was quite subtle and mysterious.<br>When Eggy was awake, Chu Feng would dare to attempt anything.<br>However, when Eggy was unconscious or unaware, Chu Feng would feel that it was unsuitable for him to even touch her.<br>&ldquo;Little girl, you must not lie dormant for so long in vain. I hope that you&rsquo;ll be able to become even stronger than me. I do not need you to protect me. I merely wish that you will not waste your talent by being with me.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, a deep sense of guilt emerged in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Chu Feng had never doubted Eggy&rsquo;s talent. However, as she was sealed in Chu Feng&rsquo;s body and the remnants of the power of Chu Feng&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s seal remained, Eggy&rsquo;s talent ended up being greatly restricted.<br>Even though she had such terrifying heaven-defying battle power, her cultivation increased very slowly.<br>Because of this, Chu Feng felt guilt and remorse. Had it not been for him, Eggy&rsquo;s cultivation would have definitely not been limited to her current cultivation.<br>After sighing with remorse, Chu Feng cast his awareness back into his own body.<br>However, right after Chu Feng returned to his own body, his expression changed. Then, he looked to his Cosmos Sack.<br>A transformation had occurred to an item within his Cosmos Sack.<br>It was&hellip; the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram.<br>The Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram was a precious treasure.<br>There were only eight such diagrams in the entire Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>Apart from the one that Chu Feng possessed, six other Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagrams had already appeared.<br>Those six Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagrams each recorded a mysterious place, never-before discovered. Contained inside those mysterious places were legendary mysterious treasures.<br>As for his Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram, it was the seventh to appear.<br>It was also something that Chu Feng had obtained in the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s auction.<br>Speaking of it, the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram was not something that Chu Feng had obtained with his own ability. Instead, it was something that the Illusory Blood Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had gifted Chu Feng.<br>During the auction, the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had warned that the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram was not something that one would be able to open just because one was a world spiritist. If one wanted to open it, one must be fated to do so.<br>Unfated individuals might not be able to open the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram in their entire lifetime, whereas fated individuals might be able to unlock the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram right after obtaining it.<br>Regretfully, it had been some time since Chu Feng had obtained the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram. Yet, he had been unable to open it.<br>Never did Chu Feng expect the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram to have an abnormal change at that moment.<br>Because of this, Chu Feng became extremely joyous. He knew that the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram would not change like that without a cause.<br>Chu Feng took the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram out immediately. After he opened the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram, he discovered that the diagram was actually emitting bright light.<br>The light was so bright that it even dazzled Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>However, that bright light only lasted for a split second before disappearing.<br>When Chu Feng looked at the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram again, he discovered that it was still completely devoid of any content, and resembled a blank scroll.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart tensed up. He pondered, &lsquo;Could my Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram be a fake?&rsquo;<br>However, in the next moment, Chu Feng felt a very intense stinging pain in his eyes. The pain was so strong that he was unable to keep his eyes open. It was as if he had been injured by the dazzling light from before.<br>The stinging pain lasted for a very long time before finally easing.<br>When Chu Feng opened his eyes again, he was surprised to discover that a spirit beast had appeared on the previously empty Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram.<br>That spirit beast was very vivid and lifelike, and was even moving.<br>It resembled an actual living creature.<br>The spirit beast continued to walk around the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram. Immediately, Chu Feng noticed that the special pattern on that spirit beast&rsquo;s body was actually a map.<br>After pondering for a while, Chu Feng determined the location recorded on the map. It was the Scarlet Province Upper Realm.<br>&ldquo;Scarlet Province Upper Realm, is that where this Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram&rsquo;s mysterious place is located?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Haha. My Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram actually really opened. The Heavens are helping me.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng became wild with joy. He knew very well that his Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram had opened, and that the location recorded on the map should be a mysterious place.<br>Having just returned from the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, Chu Feng was pondering where he should go to train. However, the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram had now opened. It was truly the will of the heavens.<br>&ldquo;Thump, thump, thump&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly heard someone knocking on his palace&rsquo;s entrance gate.<br>Chu Feng turned his attention toward the entrance. As his eyes transformed, the walls before him all became transparent. Even the entrance gate disappeared before his sight.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was able to clearly see the situation outside the entrance.<br>After Chu Feng discovered who it was that was knocking on his entrance gate, he immediately got up and rushed toward the palace entrance gate to open it.<br>When the entrance gate was opened, Chu Feng immediately bowed respectfully.<br>The reason for that was because the person standing outside the palace entrance was the strongest expert of the Chu Heavenly Clan, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Lord Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;My, there&rsquo;s no need for you to be so overly courteous.&rdquo;<br>Before Chu Feng could finish his bow, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Lord Clan Chief stopped him. Then, he walked into Chu Feng&rsquo;s palace.<br>&ldquo;Senior, when did you return?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked happily.<br>&ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; the Lord Clan Chief replied.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ve heard that you&rsquo;re already a rank five Martial Immortal. So it was real.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, what happened inside the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm should be real too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You have truly not disappointed me. You&rsquo;re even more outstanding than I had anticipated.&rdquo;<br>The Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s face was covered in smiles as he looked at Chu Feng with pride filled eyes.<br>It would appear that he had heard about all of Chu Feng&rsquo;s accomplishments in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my grandfather and my father&rsquo;s contributions. I merely enjoyed the rewards of others&rsquo; efforts,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Boy, there&rsquo;s no need for you to act modest before me,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said with a smile. Then, he looked to the scroll in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand. He asked, &ldquo;Is that the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, you&rsquo;ve come at the perfect time. My Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram has opened,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s eyes started to shine. Then, he turned his gaze to Chu Feng&rsquo;s Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram.<br>However, after inspecting it, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s expression changed. With a flabbergasted tone, he said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s&hellip; nothing there?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
