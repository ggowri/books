        <h1>Chapter 3429</h1>
        <div> - Public Refusal?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, the entire region burst into a total uproar.<br>The crowd were all trying to guess who the person wearing the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was.<br>At the same time, the crowd&rsquo;s eyes were all focused on Chu Feng. They were waiting for his response.<br>However, after both Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan had both voiced their intentions, Chu Feng still didn&rsquo;t answer.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that Chu Feng did not wish to answer. Rather&hellip; he was unable to even speak.<br>However, neither Grandmaster Liangqiu nor Grandmaster Long Xuan knew that.<br>As such, the two of them were placed in an identical situation, and felt very embarrassed.<br>&ldquo;Young friend?&rdquo; Finally, Grandmaster Long Xuan spoke again.<br>He still didn&rsquo;t address Chu Feng by name. He felt that it was very possible that Chu Feng did not wish to expose his identity.<br>Although that was only his guess, he also did not wish to expose Chu Feng&rsquo;s identity before the crowd knew that the person wearing the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was Chu Feng. He felt that doing so was a sign of respect toward Chu Feng.<br>However, at that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s reaction toward them was not very respectful.<br>Both him and Grandmaster Liangqiu had publicly announced their intention to Chu Feng, publicly declared that they wished to take him as their disciple. Regardless of whether or not he was willing to accept either of them, he should still give them a response.<br>However, Chu Feng actually didn&rsquo;t say anything. In fact, he completely refused to acknowledge them.<br>Regardless of who it might be, they would think Chu Feng&rsquo;s behavior to be excessively rude.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, can you give me a response as to whether or not you&rsquo;re willing?&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan&rsquo;s tone had turned somewhat displeased.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at the next moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body shifted. The surroundings that were basked in brilliant light instantly darkened.<br>As it turned out, Chu Feng had disappeared.<br>Chu Feng&hellip; had actually left.<br>&ldquo;Why would that guy leave?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this? Could it be&hellip; he actually refused both Grandmaster Long Xuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s kind intentions?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What personality! Exactly who is that person? He is most definitely extraordinary!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the person wearing the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak had actually left like that without even bothering to pay attention to Grandmaster Long Xuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu, the crowd became even more interested in the mysterious person.<br>After all, there was likely no one in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield that would dare to act like that towards Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, exactly who is that person? How could he be so rude?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, that person is wearing the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, right? Did he really manage to breach the grand formation left behind by the World Spiritist Immortal King?&rdquo;<br>Haunted by curiosity, there were audacious individuals that directly turned to question Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>However, neither Grandmaster Liangqiu nor Grandmaster Long Xuan bothered to pay attention to the crowd. The two of them did not even bother to look at the crowd.<br>Instead, right after Chu Feng disappeared, their bodies shifted, and they too disappeared.<br>&ldquo;They left?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could they have gone to chase after that person?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The two Grandmasters are actually unwilling to give up on someone so rude?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To be able to make the two Grandmasters so determined, exactly who is that person?&rdquo;<br>After Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan left, the crowd became even more curious as to who the person wearing the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was.<br>&hellip;...<br>No one would&rsquo;ve imagined that the person wearing the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was Chu Feng.<br>More importantly, never would the crowd have expected that neither Grandmaster Liangqiu nor Grandmaster Long Xuan were able to catch up to Chu Feng after he left.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s speed was too fast. Due to the fact that his speed was too fast, Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan noticed that the situation seemed fishy.<br>After searching for some time, Grandmaster Long Xuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu coincidentally ran into each other again.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, no matter how powerful young friend Chu Feng might be, it would still be impossible for him to possess such speed. Besides, he doesn&rsquo;t seem like a rude person. He couldn&rsquo;t possibly refuse to acknowledge us after obtaining the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak. The current situation is simply too fishy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you think&hellip; that he is being controlled?&rdquo; At that moment, there was no longer any sign of anger on Grandmaster Long Xuan&rsquo;s face. On the contrary, he had a worried look.<br>He felt that Chu Feng was not deliberately ignoring them. Rather, it seemed more like he was being controlled by some sort of power.<br>&ldquo;Based on this old man&rsquo;s observation, there was nothing abnormal regarding young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Originally, I thought him to be fine, and had thought that he was able to instantly leave the grand formation because of the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak. After all&hellip; that was a treasure left behind by the World Spiritist Immortal King.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, looking at the situation now, it does seem very fishy,&rdquo; like Grandmaster Long Xuan, Grandmaster Liangqiu also had a worried look on his face.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, I will continue my search. However, you&hellip; should return and have a look first. After all, those people of the younger generation have all received a backlash. We don&rsquo;t know what will happen afterwards. We will need you to stabilize the situation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is all thanks to those people of the younger generation that we were able to make a successful breakthrough this time around. We absolutely cannot allow anything to happen to them,&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan said.<br>&ldquo;Mn, that is also what this old man was thinking of doing,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu nodded. However, there was an expression of helplessness in his eyes.<br>Actually, he had wanted to continue to search for Chu Feng. After all, Chu Feng was extremely important to him. He was very afraid that something might&rsquo;ve happened to him.<br>However, what Grandmaster Long Xuan said was very correct too. Although the grand formation had been breached, things had surpassed their expectations. No one knew what would happen afterwards, no one knew if those people of the younger generation would be met with just the simple backlash that they&rsquo;d received.<br>As such, he must return to have a look.<br>&ldquo;Wuu~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, Grandmaster Long Xuan suddenly started frowning. An expression of pain covered his face as he firmly grabbed his chest. In an instant, his aura became very unstable.<br>&ldquo;Long Xuan, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s expression immediately changed upon seeing this.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, I&hellip; seem to have also been affected by the backlash,&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan raised his head. Although it had just happened, his complexion was already paper-pale. It seemed like he was suffering from a serious illness.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s expression became even more stern.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t continue searching for Chu Feng anymore. Follow me back,&rdquo; as Grandmaster Liangqiu spoke, he grabbed Grandmaster Long Xuan and began to fly toward the Ice Summit.<br>At that moment, his heart was filled with raging anxiety and unease.<br>For Grandmaster Long Xuan to have also received a backlash, it meant that Liangqiu Chengfeng, Queen Mother Fox Immortal and Wuming Xingyun must&rsquo;ve received a backlash too.<br>Although they had all benefited enormously from the breaching of the grand formation, the current situation was heading in a detrimental direction. Sure enough&hellip; the power of the grand formation could not be obtained so smoothly.<br>When even someone like Grandmaster Long Xuan received a backlash, who knew what would happen later on?<br>No matter what might happen, as the leader of this event, he must exhaust his greatest efforts to protect everyone, and prevent things from becoming even worse.<br></p></div>
