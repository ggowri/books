        <div> -  Have Committed All Sorts Of Evil<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all. I think that Chu Feng has already woken up that girl. Else, that Icesnow Phoenix old man would not have immediately eliminated the people from our Dark Hall upon his return,&rdquo; Xue Ji said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s Chu Feng again. If I knew this was going to happen, I would&rsquo;ve crippled him at the Blood Devouring Killing Formation!&rdquo;<br>The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was so furious that his complexion turned blue. His veins were all bulging and raging flames filled his heart. He was nearly on the verge of exploding.<br>Back then, he had simply not placed Chu Feng in his eyes at all. He had felt that the only obstacle in the Holy Land of Martialism that was capable of getting in his way were the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, that his only opponents were the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves.<br>As for Chu Feng, a person who was also from the Outer World like him, he had not placed him in his eyes at all. He had not worried about Chu Feng, and had merely considered him to be a plaything.<br>However, his many plans had now all been ruined because of Chu Feng. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Chu Feng, he might have already eliminated the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, and turned the Dark Hall into the ruler of the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the only one that underestimated Chu Feng. Thus, you don&rsquo;t have to blame yourself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The problem we have at hand is that the Icesnow Phoenixes will definitely come to attack us should they find out the truth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Likely, the newly formed Alliance Army will also arrive soon. With our current strength, we will likely not be able to withstand them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus&hellip; we must withdraw from this place. If we are to withdraw now, if it is only you and I, we will be able to get away,&rdquo; Xue Ji said to the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Withdraw? How could we withdraw? If we are to withdraw now, wouldn&rsquo;t all of our efforts go to waste?&rdquo; The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master looked down below him. His eyes were filled with reluctance.<br>&ldquo;Xue Ji, if I were to forcibly refine that thing right now, what would happen?&rdquo; The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain. However, at the very least, you will not die. Merely, it will be imperfect,&rdquo; Xue Ji said.<br>Hearing those words, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master narrowed his eyes. He began to enter deep contemplation. After a long while, he said, &ldquo;Release World Devastator and Immeasurable. Give the order to all the people of our Dark Hall.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tell them, prepare for battle!!!&rdquo;<br>The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master came to that decision. Xue Ji smiled faintly. Then, without any hesitation, she said, &ldquo;Got it.&rdquo;<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...<br>Soon, the Alliance Army had arrived at the Dark Hall&rsquo;s headquarters. It was a vast snowy valley.<br>Merely, countless Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts and people from the Dark Hall were densely packed over the top of the snowy valley.<br>Some of the people from the Dark Hall were not wearing masks. All those that weren&rsquo;t wearing masks were familiar faces.<br>They were the World Devastator Immortal, the Immeasurable Immortal, the Heavenly Law Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master, the Mortal King Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master and some of the management elders from the Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace.<br>One thing worthy of being mentioned was that the leader of this group of people was a person who was also not wearing a mask. That man did not conceal his cultivation. He was a rank five Martial Emperor. At that moment, he was standing at the position of the boss. Evidently&hellip; he was the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;What a show. You were originally my allies. Yet, you all are now standing against me with my enemies.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ve heard that it&rsquo;s all because of your good deed.&rdquo; The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master looked to Chu Feng with a beaming smile. However, his smiling gaze was filled with killing intent.<br>Hatred. He felt enormously deep hatred for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;&rdquo;What I&rsquo;ve done was naturally a good deed. As for you, what you&rsquo;ve done are only malicious deeds,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Malicious deeds? Very well. Since you feel that I&rsquo;ve done all sorts of malicious deeds, I might as well do one more malicious deed today,&rdquo;<br>The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master smiled strangely. As he spoke, he waved his sleeve, and a spirit formation flashed through his surroundings. After that spirit formation flashed, a figure appeared before the crowd.<br>Upon seeing that person, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression immediately changed. The reason for that was because that person was Emperor Huang&rsquo;s successor, Duan Jidao.<br>Duan Jidao was extremely thin. Being extremely old already&hellip; he appeared completely withered right now. He had the appearance of someone on the verge of dying.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?!&rdquo;<br>When Duan Jidao saw Chu Feng, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, the Icesnow Phoenixes and the army composed of experts from all over the Holy Land of Martialism, his expression changed.<br>Suddenly, Duan Jidao started to smile. He looked to the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master and said, &ldquo;It would seem that your days are numbered. People have come to avenge this old man.&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing what Duan Jidao said, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart immediately tightened. Back then, Duan Jidao had been captured by the Dark Hall together with Yin Gongfu. However, now, only Duan Jidao appeared before them. Furthermore, he said those words. It was evident that Yin Gongfu was no longer here.<br>&ldquo;Avenge you? Will that pile of trash really be able to do that?&rdquo; The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master smiled mockingly at Duan Jidao&rsquo;s words. After saying those words, he made a grabbing motion with his hand, and Duan Jidao began to fly toward him. Then, he straightened his hand into a blade and pierced it into Duan Jidao&rsquo;s body and grabbed his dantian.<br>Seeing this scene, Chu Feng immediately shouted, &ldquo;Release him!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Release him? Me, as someone who has committed all sorts of evil, do you really think I will release him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you must&rsquo;ve considered yourself a hero, and considered saving that bunch of trash as your duty, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, I&rsquo;ll let you know how tiny and insignificant you really are. You are simply unable to save anyone I wish to kill,&rdquo; After saying those words, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s hand tightened abruptly. &ldquo;Bang,&rdquo; he had crushed Duan Jidao&rsquo;s dantian.<br>However, Duan Jidao did not even utter a single scream, even though his dantian had been destroyed. Instead, he opened his mouth and started to laugh. Then, with an extremely weak voice, he said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, I am someone who was soon to die anyway. Even without having him kill me, I would still have died.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, Gongfu and the others, they should not have died. Kill that animal and avenge th&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before Duan Jidao could finish his words, his body exploded.<br>It was the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master. Not only had the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master crushed Duan Jidao&rsquo;s dantian, he had also destroyed his body. He had killed Duan Jidao.<br>&ldquo;Trash, come and take your revenge. I shall see what you can possibly do,&rdquo; After killing Duan Jidao, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master started to provoke Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Kill!!!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a furious snarl was heard. Following that, a figure instantly arrived before the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master and began to attack him. It was Du Wanwu. Being a rank nine Martial Emperor now, Du Wanwu had taken the initiative to attack the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Perfect timing.&rdquo;<br>However, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master seemed to have already prepared for Du Wanwu&rsquo;s attack. At the moment Du Wanwu approached him, his body began to flicker with lightning. Then, his<br>Lightning<br>Wings and<br>Lightning<br>Armor appeared on his body.<br>Not only that, his body also shifted to the side and dodged Du Wanwu&rsquo;s attack. Then, he raised his leg and kicked Du Wanwu. He had actually managed to kick Du Wanwu, a rank nine Martial Emperor, and send him flying.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, he possesses a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation,&rdquo; Seeing that scene, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. Seriousness appeared in his gaze.<br>Even if the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s cultivation had increased to that of a rank seven Martial Emperor after using his<br>Lightning<br>Armor and<br>Lightning<br>Wings, he should not be able to contend against a rank nine Martial Emperor.<br>However, not only had he accomplished that, he was also holding superiority over Du Wanwu. This meant that he was the same as Chu Feng, and possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation.<br>Ordinary Martial Emperors only possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. As for him, his heaven-defying battle power was two entire levels of cultivations above that of ordinary Martial Emperors. Naturally, that ended up making up for the difference in their martial cultivations.<br><br></p></div>
