        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hold back then,&rdquo; Chu Feng thought in his mind.</span><br><span>He exerted his control over the five formation armors and ordered them to enter the humongous formation. He immediately sensed the humongous formation extending over, imposing stress on him. Just as he had expected, tempering the formation armors was not an easy job.</span><br><span>Of course, this burden was nothing to him. It was within his means to cope with it. Nevertheless, he still feigned a look of pain.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Not bad. 521 is actually able to withstand the formation despite simultaneously controlling five formation armors?&rdquo; the emaciated elder muttered.</span><br><span>They thought that Chu Feng&rsquo;s performance was outstanding even though he was downplaying his capabilities. However, the latter didn&rsquo;t care too much about what they thought of him. What was important to him was for the others to not see through what he was doing.</span><br><span>In truth, he was secretly constructing a formation inside the humongous formation by channeling his spirit power through the formation armors. None of those present here were incompetent fools. Even if his understanding of the underground sea of energy was above the others, he still had to be extra careful so as to not get caught.</span><br><span>He had to greatly exert himself for that, resulting in his feigned pain slowly becoming </span><span>true pain.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hold on, 521. You&rsquo;ll be promoted to a chief elder as long as you accomplish this mission,&rdquo; the three elders quickly cheered for Chu Feng upon realizing that he was close to his limits.</span><br><span>They were only saying that because they didn&rsquo;t know how great Chu Feng&rsquo;s willpower was. While his weakness was not feigned, and an ordinary person would have already been at their limit in his condition, he still had a long way to go before caving in.</span><br><span>Chu Feng successfully completed his formation in the end. Once he invoked his formation, he would be able to destroy this humongous formation and hinder the forging of the shell.</span><br><span>However, he chose not to activate it right away.</span><br><span>He was waiting for the eighteen formation armors, which he had planted his formations, to be fully tempered. In truth, he had also been making progress on tempering the formation armors. He could have completed the tempering before Jie Tian, but he made sure to control his pace so that </span><span>hewas</span><span> even slower than the latter even though he was only tempering five formations.</span><br><span>This would show that he was weaker than Jie Tian.</span><br><span>He also found a whiff of teleportation energy that would allow him to escape from here in the humongous formation. He was perplexed as to why there was teleportation energy hiding in such a discreet location, but it could save his life when he was in a desperate situation.</span><br><span>He wasn&rsquo;t sure what plans Jie Tian had in store for him&mdash;the latter might try to get rid of him once he helped him temper the five formation armors. If that was the case, he was in grave danger.</span><br><span>He had no idea where the teleportation energy led to, but it was better than dying here.</span><br><span>Still, he refrained from activating the teleportation energy right away as he wasn&rsquo;t sure what Jie Tian&rsquo;s stance was. If Jie Tian trusted him and decided to keep him by his side, he would be able to do much more to sabotage him.</span><br><span>For instance, if Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t followed Jie Tian here, he wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten a chance to tamper with this humongous formation.</span><br><span>Soon, Jie Tian finished tempering the thirteen formation armors, whereas Chu Feng was still a bit off from fully tempering his five formation armors.</span><br><span>Jie Tian walked over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side and encouraged him, &ldquo;Persevere, 521.&rdquo;</span><br><span>He was in a terribly weakened state after tempering the thirteen formation armors, so he hoped that Chu Feng could complete the remaining five by himself.</span><br><span>In truth, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t need any encouragement since he had plenty of strength to spare. Seeing that Jie Tian had succeeded, he decided to drop the act and finish tempering the five formation armors.</span><br><span>Right as he was about to take out the five formation armors, he activated his formation to destroy the humongous formation.</span><br><span>Boom </span><span>boom</span><span> </span><span>boom</span><span>!</span><br><span>The ground shook, and the humongous formation raged.</span><br><span>The humongous formation was still operational by the time everything calmed down, </span><span>but its energy could no longer be channeled into the shell. This was the effect Chu Feng was going for, as well as the limit of his ability.</span><br><span>On the one hand, he didn&rsquo;t have the power to destroy the humongous formation. On the other hand, it was harder for him to get caught this way.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Jie Tian roared.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How did this happen?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The three elders inspected the formation, but they were unable to discern what was wrong.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you able to repair it?&rdquo; Jie Tian asked.</span><br><span>The three elders frowned. They had been examining the formation for some time now, but they couldn&rsquo;t tell what was wrong. Somehow, the formation&rsquo;s energy simply couldn&rsquo;t be channeled into the shell anymore.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible to repair it, but it&rsquo;ll take some time,&rdquo; the emaciated elder replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo; Jie Tian asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; hard to say,&rdquo; the emaciated elder replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hard to say?&rdquo; Jie Tian realized that the elders wouldn&rsquo;t be able to complete the formation in time and lost his temper. &ldquo;You useless things. You can&rsquo;t even do something as simple as this!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The three elders were too ashamed to refute his words, knowing that they had failed. The angered Jie Tian got into his formation armor and made his way toward the humongous formation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Jie Tian, you mustn&rsquo;t enter the formation!&rdquo; the three elders exclaimed.</span><br><span>The energy harnessed inside the humongous formation was violent in nature due to the effects of the shell.</span><br><span>Something shocking happened.</span><br><span>The energy inside the humongous formation attacked Jie Tian when he entered, but he was unharmed by it. Instead, he began to devour the shell&rsquo;s energy.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Jie Tian&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>The three elders were taken aback. Something that shouldn&rsquo;t have happened was happening right before their eyes.</span><br><span>On top of that, Chu Feng noticed that Jie Tian&rsquo;s formation armor was swiftly becoming stronger.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t good. Jie Tian is using the shell&rsquo;s energy to enhance his formation armor!&rdquo; Chu Feng was alarmed.</span><br><span>Jie Tian, in his current state, could no longer be suppressed by the eighteen formation armors or even the enhanced Little Fishy.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t good. I have to inform Little Fishy of the matter.&rdquo;</span><br><span>With this thought in mind, Chu Feng leaped into the humongous formation and headed straight for the whiff of teleportation energy.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hm? What&rsquo;s that brat doing?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The three elders were taken aback. Jie Tian also looked at Chu Feng in confusion.</span><br><span>By the time they understood what was going on, Chu Feng had already come into contact with the teleportation energy lurking in the depth of the formation and made his escape.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to escape!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The three elders simultaneously made their moves to capture Chu Feng, but the latter was no longer around. They clenched their fists in anger.</span><br><span>In contrast, Jie Tian looked incredibly calm.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, he can&rsquo;t escape.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Tian opened up his palm and formed a series of hand seals. An imprint surfaced on his palm and dissipated into a whiff of aura.</span><br><span>The three elders immediately understood what had happened, for they were the ones who had given the poison pill to Jie Tian.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Jie Tian is indeed thorough,&rdquo; the three elders complimented.</span><br><span>Jie Tian was satisfied with the compliment, saying, &ldquo;I, Jie Tian, don&rsquo;t err.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Jie Tian is indeed trustworthy, but why would there be a whiff of teleportation energy inside the formation?&rdquo; the three elders asked in confusion.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How am I to know? You were the ones who constructed the formation here,&rdquo; Jie Tian roared in anger.</span><br><span>The three elders lowered their heads in embarrassment, not daring to refute. Jie Tian took the eighteen tempered formation armors and brought them out to perform the final step of processing them.</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng had been teleported to a mountain peak through the teleportation energy. He was still in the Star Memorial Domain, but his surroundings looked extremely foreign to him. He had never been here before.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>A powerful surge of spirit power suddenly descended from the sky and enveloped him.</span><br><span>Chu Feng raised his head and saw another figure in the sky&mdash;Little Fishy! He had been coincidentally teleported to where she was!</span><br><span>Little Fishy must have just discovered him and decided to curb him right away. However, she quickly froze up when she took a closer look at him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Little Fishy stared at Chu Feng in disbelief. Her eyes turned a little wet.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lass, it has been a long time,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother, is it really you?&rdquo;</span><br><span>A brilliant smile broke out on Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> lips. Without any hesitation, she retracted her spirit power and charged at him.</span><br><span>Chu Feng felt a whiff of fragrance rushing at him. Little Fishy had already leaped into his arms, her slender arms tightly wrapping around him as if frightened that he would suddenly vanish. While he was delighted to be embraced by Little Fishy, he couldn&rsquo;t help but ask, &ldquo;Lass, aren&rsquo;t you too bold? What if you recognize the wrong person and get taken advantage of?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Their meeting was simply too abrupt. Had he not known about her in advance and simply randomly met her here, he would have stopped and wondered if the Little Fishy before him was the real one.</span><br><span>However, Little Fishy replied, &ldquo;How could I not recognize big brother? I&rsquo;d recognize you even if I fail to recognize my real big brother!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng was heartened to hear those words, though he felt bad for </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span>. &ldquo;I wonder how Brother </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> will feel if he hears those words.&rdquo;</span><br></p></div>
