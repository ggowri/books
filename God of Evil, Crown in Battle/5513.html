        <h1>Chapter 5513: Humans Aren’t Worthy?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Chu Feng found Long Chengyu and the others&rsquo; auras and quickly chased after them. He deduced that the auras he had absorbed from the cavern were the key to completing the formation.</span><br><span>Supposing that to be the case, he would be able to help them.</span><br><span>Following Long Chengyu and the others&rsquo; auras, he soon arrived in front of a formation. He had known that the formation was anything but simple, but it was so hulking that it was comparable to a mountain range. It was only when standing before it that one could feel its magnificence.</span><br><span>The formation was linked to a formation core. Two groups were gathered in the vicinity&mdash;one from the Totem Dragon Clan and one from the Totem Phoenix Clan. Long Chengyu, Long Muxi, Feng Tiansheng, and Feng Jiuyue were not among the group.</span><br><span>That being said, there were still some familiar faces, such as the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Long Shanshan and Long Fulai. They were all standing inside the formation core with </span><span>tight frowns and warped faces. They were probably facing a great deal of pain.</span><br><span>Auras could be visibly seen manifesting from their bodies and fusing into the formation. The two auras looked similar, just that the Totem Dragon Clansmen&rsquo;s auras carried a dragon silhouette whereas the Totem Phoenix Clansmen&rsquo;s auras carried a phoenix silhouette.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng understood two things from this sight.</span><br><span>One, the auras were probably manifested from the silhouettes in the cavern fusing with one&rsquo;s bloodline. That was the case for Chu Feng too, just that he possessed the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline, so his aura manifested as red lightning.</span><br><span>Two, he was right in deducing that the completion of the formation relied on the silhouettes&rsquo; aura, just that the process was much more straightforward than he had expected. All one had to do was fuse their aura into the formation.</span><br><span>The only thing he was confused about was why those people were in so much pain. Was the process of releasing their auras painful?</span><br><span>While Chu Feng was deep in thought, a Totem Dragon Clansman noticed Chu Feng and excitedly exclaimed, &ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng! It&rsquo;s young hero Chu Feng! He&rsquo;s here too!&rdquo;</span><br><span>All of the Totem Dragon Clansmen turned their sights to Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng!!!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Shanshan and Long Fulai immediately left the formation core and ran toward Chu Feng. The other juniors of the Totem Dragon Clan cheered too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Wonderful! Now that young hero Chu Feng is here, we can complete the formation!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng had always achieved the impossible whenever they were in a deadlock, which was why they thought that he could help them with the formation too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hah, you sure are hilarious! A member of the Dragon Clan is relying so much on a mere human!&rdquo; a sharp-nosed woman from the Totem Phoenix Clan sneered in hostility.</span><br><span>Chu Feng had seen her before. She was one of the first few people in the Totem Phoenix Clan to beg him for help, but instead of gratitude, she harbored hostility toward him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You sure are interesting. Have you forgotten who saved your pathetic lives in the Demon Crane?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hoh! Are you angry because you had to pay a hefty sum to be saved? Or are you simply envious of young hero Chu Feng&rsquo;s means?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Shanshan and the other Totem Dragon Clansmen criticized the Totem Phoenix Clan.</span><br><span>That sight heartened Chu Feng. He could still remember how arrogant her attitude was when they first met. She was worse than the Totem Phoenix Clan back then, only to become so protective of him now. This showed that he had won their respect with his strength, which felt exceptionally satisfying.</span><br><span>However, the Totem Phoenix Clansmen thought nothing about the Totem Dragon Clansmen&rsquo;s rebuttal. If anything, their insults became even more jarring. In particular, the sharp-nosed woman even walked out of the formation core to confront Long </span><span>Shanshan, looking determined to get to the bottom of this matter.</span><br><span>Completing the formation seemed to have become of secondary concern.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Take a closer look at what you have become! Have you forgotten the cavern&rsquo;s trial? This place needs someone who possesses a monstrous beast bloodline, particularly the Monstrous Beast King&rsquo;s bloodline. It&rsquo;s already a miracle that a human can get in here, and you&rsquo;re counting on him to complete the formation for you?&rdquo; the sharp-nosed woman pointed her finger at Chu Feng as she scoffed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, are you&hellip; all right?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Only then did the Totem Dragon Clansmen realize that Chu Feng was in a bad state. Not only did he look weak, but there was also a stench on him too.</span><br><span>The stench came from the tempering he had gone through before entering the cavern. While he had constructed a formation to clean himself afterward, the stench was so strong that it seemed as if it had seeped into his soul. He was unable to completely get rid of it. Even so, he had at least removed half of it, or else everyone here would have been vomiting on their knees.</span><br><span>He was also in a weak state from the backlash of channeling the red lightning beast&rsquo;s powers. Even though the intervention from the mysterious being had alleviated his condition, it wasn&rsquo;t enough for him to make a full recovery. Thus, he was indeed not in his best condition.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Chu Feng told the worried Long Shanshan and the others. &ldquo;Are there any benefits to completing this formation?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;There are. The completion of the formation will grant us an opportunity to cultivate, but I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;ll be useful to young hero Chu Feng. This opportunity is intended for us, who possess the monstrous beast bloodline,&rdquo; Long Shanshan said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let me take a look.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng approached the formation core and placed his hand on it. It didn&rsquo;t take him long to grasp the nature of the formation. The completion of the formation would create a fortuitous encounter for one to temper one&rsquo;s monstrous beast bloodline, which meant that it was useless for humans like him.</span><br><span>Whoever completed the formation would have control over the fortuitous encounter, meaning that they could include their people and exclude others. That was why both the Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen were desperately infusing their auras into it.</span><br><span>If Chu Feng gained control over the formation, he could give the fortuitous encounter away to the Totem Dragon Clansmen.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It might be useless to me, but I can help you. Call the others out.&rdquo; Chu Feng beckoned at the Totem Dragon Clansmen inside the formation core.</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen obediently walked out.</span><br><span>The sight of them left the Totem Dragon Clansmen flustered. Those who had left the formation core quickly returned to their respective positions to continue the infusion of their auras.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What are you panicking for? Do you honestly think a human like him could complete the formation? Only those fools from the Totem Dragon Clan would trust him that much!&rdquo; The sharp-nosed woman from the Totem Phoenix Clan thought </span><span>nothing about the matter.</span><br><span>Many Totem Phoenix Clansmen breathed a sigh of relief. The sharp-nosed woman&rsquo;s words might be jarring, but they made sense. Even they could tell that this formation was constructed for monstrous beasts.</span><br><span>Given how Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t even pass through the barrier to enter the cavern earlier, it was evident that this place was hostile toward humans. It was unlikely that he would be able to exert his overwhelming powers here.</span><br><span>Chu Feng simply chuckled softly as he stepped into the formation core and raised his hand.</span><br><span>Bzzt!</span><br><span>Blinding red light instantaneously irradiated the surroundings amidst a deep rumble. Lightning power poured out from Chu Feng with a volcano eruption, rushing straight toward the formation.</span></p></div>
