        <h1>Chapter 3548</h1>
        <div> - Despair<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Yun&rsquo;er, rest assured, in the future, I will wash away today&rsquo;s humiliation together with you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I swear that I will have them regret what they&rsquo;ve done here today,&rdquo; said a young man who stood beside Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>That person was the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Son, Song Yunfei.<br>However, Xia Yun&rsquo;er acted as if she did not hear him. She continued to stare outside, observing the situation outside.<br>Song Yunfei did not say anything about her behavior.<br>However, he was certain that she had heard him. She was deliberately ignoring him.<br>Back then, they had had such a good relationship. However, ever since he got into a conflict with Chu Feng before the Void Sacred Tree, Xia Yun&rsquo;er had been alienating herself from him whenever she saw him.<br>Even when he tried extra hard to curry favors from her, it was still useless.<br>Song Yunfei understood that it was actually all due to a single person that Xia Yun&rsquo;er ended up alienating herself from him. As for that person, he was Chu Feng.<br>After all, Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son. That identity of his was something that countless people would feel envy toward.<br>That said, although Song Yunfei felt envy towards Chu Feng, he did not worry too much, as Chu Feng has been expelled by the Chu Heavenly Clan for being trash.<br>He felt that even if Chu Feng was capable of cultivating, he would not be able to enjoy easy days upon his return to the Chu Heavenly Clan. In fact, he might even die in the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Merely, never did he imagine that Chu Feng not only obtained the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s acknowledgement after returning, but he also received favorable attention from the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Moreover, he had also defeated the numerous geniuses of the Li Heavenly Clan. Reportedly, even Li Anzhi, ranked tenth of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, was defeated by Chu Feng.<br>Even though Song Yunfei was still unwilling to believe that Chu Feng had defeated Li Anzhi, news of it had spread all over. Furthermore, it was in full detail, and very likely to be real.<br>Thinking up to that point,, Song Yunfei felt extremely upset.<br>It seemed like the disparity between him and Chu Feng was increasing more and more. Faced with such a Chu Feng, how was he to regain Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s favor?<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a loud rumble sounded from outside. Looking out, the people inside the Starfall Holy Stone were all shocked. Deep unease and worry filled their faces.<br>The Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master went out to take on eighteen experts of the same cultivation from the Blood-devouring Demon Sect.<br>Currently, the Holy Master was not only emitting dark purple gaseous flames from his body, but there was also an enormous silhouette behind him. That was a warrior emitting white light.<br>One could not see that warrior&rsquo;s face or body clearly. One could only see a fuzzy outline.<br>However, one could sense its impressive might and sacred aura. It was like a god that had descended upon the world of mortals.<br>That was the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master&rsquo;s Divine Power. Through using that Divine Power, the Holy Master&rsquo;s cultivation had increased from rank one Exalted to rank two Exalted.<br>However, even with that being the case, the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master was unable to gain the slightest upper hand.<br>The reason for that was because the auras of the eighteen Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen had also increased from rank one Exalted to rank two Exalted.<br>Crimson ropes were released from their black cloaks. The ropes interwove with one another and formed an enormous formation that trapped the Starfall Holy Master.<br>Trapped within the grand formation, not only did the Holy Master start to gasp for breath, but he was unable to even stand firm. His power was feeling enormous suppression.<br>&ldquo;This formation, could it be&hellip; are they...?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the expressions of the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master and the Supreme Elders of the Starfall Holy Land turned extremely ugly.<br>They had managed to obtain clues from the formation.<br>&ldquo;Blood-devouring Soul-chaining Formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You all are from the Blood-devouring Demon Clan?&rdquo; the Holy Master asked.<br>&ldquo;Tsk tsk tsk, to only discover that now, you're truly too slow, no?&rdquo; The Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen mocked.<br>&ldquo;We cannot allow the Holy Master to confront those Demon Clansmen by himself! We have to take them down with us!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a Supreme Elder of the Starfall Holy Land crushed the stone in his hand and was teleported out of the Starfall Holy Stone.<br>Following that, the other Supreme Elders and ordinary elders also crushed their stones to teleport out.<br>&ldquo;Bring us out too!&rdquo;<br>After being asked by the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, the experts of the Ghost Sect Hall were also teleported out of the Starfall Holy Stone.<br>In the blink of an eye, all of the top experts inside the Starfall Holy Stone were teleported out.<br>Only the people of the younger generation remained in the Starfall Holy Stone.<br>&ldquo;Who told you all to come out here?!&rdquo; The Starfall Holy Master was furious upon seeing them.<br>&ldquo;Lord Holy Master, even if you must blame us, we absolutely cannot allow you to confront all of this alone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, we will take them down with us!&rdquo; the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Supreme Elders said.<br>&ldquo;Even if we are to die, we cannot allow ourselves to die like cowards, no?&rdquo; The Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said with a smile on his face. Compared to the others, his expression was very calm. He seemed like he was not afraid of death at all.<br>Seeing the crowd like that, the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master shook his head repeatedly.<br>The crowd all pulled out their weapons and unleashed their various abilities. They were prepared to die.<br>&ldquo;Never would I expect that not all of you so-called righteous powers are cowards. However, you need not be afraid. We&hellip; will not be killing you all just yet.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, countless chains appeared and chained all of the experts that had come out.<br>Even the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was chained up. With that, they were all unable to move. As for fighting, it was simply impossible.<br>They who were planning to wage a battle of life and death were completely defeated before they could even do anything.<br>Seeing that, the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master sighed helplessly.<br>When even he was not a match for those people, a bunch of Martial Immortals would only be throwing away their lives by coming out.<br>That said, he knew that even if they continued to stay inside, the Starfall Holy Stone would sooner or later be breached. At that time, they would not be able to escape death either.<br>Thinking of this, he did not blame them too much. Instead, he sighed.<br>Inside the Starfall Holy Stone, the people of the younger generation saw the seniors that they revered being completely powerless against the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen, and felt their hearts crumble.<br>They were in despair.<br>Even though they were still alive, they were feeling a boundless area of black clouds above their heads, and darkness surrounding them. It was a lifeless atmosphere without the slightest trace of light.<br>They truly felt that they would soon be killed.<br>However, what they did not know was that there were nine figures several tens of thousands of meters away rushing toward them.<br>They were Chu Feng and the Starfall Eight Immortals.<br></p></div>
