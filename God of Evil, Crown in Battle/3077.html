        <h1>Chapter 3076</h1>
        <div> - Enter Li Anzhi<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;He really is a rank four Heavenly Immortal?&rdquo;<br>Many people revealed astonished expressions upon sensing Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura. After all, this was simply too astonishing for them.<br>Before Chu Feng disappeared, he was only a rank six True Immortal. And now, he was a rank four Heavenly Immortal. His cultivation had increased by so much in such a short period of time. The crowd was truly unable to remain unsurprised by it.<br>That said, compared to the people from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, Li Yan revealed a sneer on his face.<br>He was standing there without even bothering to move. Just like that, he waited for Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack to arrive with a confident expression on his face.<br>The reason for that was because he firmly believed that as long as Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was inferior to his own, even if Chu Feng possessed heaven-defying abilities, he would still be unable to defeat him.<br>As the number two genius of the Li Heavenly Clan, Li Yan was confident in himself.<br>In the blink of an eye, while the crowd were still astonished, Chu Feng had arrived before Li Yan.<br>At that moment, the smile on Li Yan's face grew even more intense. He said, "You're not even unleashing your Lightning Mark? Chu Feng, you've already lost."<br>Li Yan was ridiculing Chu Feng for underestimating him.<br>After he finished saying those words, Li Yan unleashed his oppressive might. With a cultivation an entire level above Chu Feng, Li Yan simply did not have to unleash any techniques. Merely his oppressive might would be enough to completely suppress the incoming Chu Feng.<br>"Boom~~~"<br>However, at the moment Li Yan unleashed his oppressive might, he felt an enormous pressure appearing out of nowhere, crushing his body. Then, with a 'putt,' he was forced onto his stomach.<br>At practically the same moment when Li Yan fell on his stomach, Chu Feng landed before him.<br>"Let me ask you this, am I qualified now?" Chu Feng asked Li Yan with a beaming smile.<br>At that moment, the people present, apart from Saintly Stellar Monk and the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief, both those from the older generation and those from the younger generation, were all stunned.<br>This was especially true for Li Yan, who was lying on the ground. He had an expression of disbelief on his face.<br>The reason for that was because the aura Chu Feng was emitting at that moment was not that of a rank four Heavenly Immortal. Instead, it was that of a rank six Heavenly Immortal.<br>"Rank six Heavenly Immortal, Chu Feng's cultivation is actually that of a rank six Heavenly Immortal?!"<br>"Am I sensing it wrong?! Is this for real?!"<br>"It's real, there's no mistake. His cultivation is indeed that of a rank six Heavenly Immortal. Chu Feng's cultivation actually reached rank six Heavenly Immortal!"<br>"But, wasn't Chu Feng only a rank six True Immortal when he disappeared? How did he become a rank six Heavenly Immortal, how did he increase his cultivation by this much in such a short period of time?!"<br>"This is truly unbelievable, simply too unfathomable!!!"<br>At that moment, voices of astonishment sounded repeatedly.<br>Hearing the crowd's cries of alarm, even the Li Heavenly Clan's younger generations revealed astonished expressions.<br>To increase one's cultivation from rank six True Immortal to rank six Heavenly Immortal in such a short period of time was truly frighteningly fast.<br>Not to mention among the Chu Heavenly Clan's younger generations, someone capable of increasing one's cultivation with a speed like Chu Feng's would be extremely rarely seen in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Suddenly, a furious curse was heard. It was Li Yan. "Bastard, you were concealing your cultivation! You are truly despicable and shameless!"<br>Li Yan's face had turned green with rage.<br>Even though Li Yan was also astonished by Chu Feng's actual cultivation, he felt furious because Chu Feng had concealed his cultivation.<br>If Chu Feng had revealed his actual cultivation from the very start, Li Yan would not have underestimated Chu Feng so much. He would not be defeated so embarrassingly. Because of that, Li Yan was feeling extremely unreconciled.<br>"Despicable?" Chu Feng chuckled coldly. He said, "You do not even understand the principle of 'there can never be too much deception in war.'"<br>"Could it be that your Li Heavenly Clan's younger generations have been nurtured in a greenhouse your entire life?"<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>Hearing what Chu Feng said, LI Yan was even more furious. However, he was unable to respond.<br>He understood the principle of &lsquo;there can never be too much deception in war.&rsquo;<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng&rsquo;s words were correct.<br>If he had to blame someone, he could only blame himself for being too careless, and not Chu Feng for being despicable.<br>&ldquo;What &lsquo;there can never be too much deception in war&rsquo;? In that case, why don&rsquo;t you allow me to experience exactly how powerful your deception in war might be.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice was heard from within the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s war chariot.<br>At the same time as that voice was heard, a figure appeared from the war chariot.<br>He was a very handsome young man. However, he had an extremely ice-cold look to him. His face resembled an iceberg. It was the sort of face that one would feel was very difficult to approach just by seeing it.<br>However, after that man appeared, the expressions of many of the grand characters present changed.<br>&ldquo;Li Anzhi, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s strongest person of the younger generation, one of our Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s Decastars. He actually came?!&rdquo;<br>There was a grand character that recognized Li Anzhi, and exclaimed in alarm.<br>&ldquo;Li Anzhi, he is that Li Anzhi?&rdquo;<br>After hearing that exclamation, the others present all instantly burst into an uproar.<br>Even though it was the first time for the great majority of people present to see Li Anzhi, their expressions all changed upon finding out who the person that had exited the war chariot was.<br>This was especially true for the people of the younger generation, they were looking at Li Anzhi with eyes filled with admiration. As for the women among them, they were looking at Li Anzhi with adoration in their eyes.<br>The reason for that was all because Li Anzhi was no ordinary member of the younger generation. Instead, he was one of the ten strongest members of the younger generations in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>After Li Anzhi exited the war chariot, he did not immediately descend to the battle stage. Instead, he stood on top of the war chariot and clasped his fist toward the Saintly Stellar Monk on the main viewing platform, &ldquo;Junior Li Anzhi pays his respects to senior.&rdquo;<br>The Saintly Stellar Monk was truly worthy of being known as the second strongest world spiritist in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield. His status was truly extraordinary.<br>Even someone as arrogant and condescending as Li Anzhi would have to respectfully greet the Saintly Stellar Monk of his own accord out of fear of offending him.<br>&ldquo;Senior, due to the orders from the seniors of my clan, this junior should not have shown myself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That was why I waited till now to come out and greet you. I hope senior will forgive me.&rdquo;<br>After clasping his fist, Li Anzhi bowed to the Saintly Stellar Monk.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no bother. I am merely a spectator. Your proper business is of greater importance,&rdquo; With a smile on his face, the Saintly Stellar Monk waved his hand. His intention was very clear. He wanted Li Anzhi to quickly have a showdown with Chu Feng. After all, even he was looking forward to their confrontation.<br>&ldquo;This junior understands,&rdquo; Li Anzhi clasped his fist respectfully again. Then, he turned his gaze to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, your father and grandfather are both very powerful. They are seniors that we admire.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, I do not know exactly what you, their descendant, are capable of,&rdquo; Li Anzhi said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m capable of? You&rsquo;ll know if you try me,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled lightly. His smile was filled with confidence.<br>&ldquo;Since I&rsquo;ve come here today, I will naturally have to give it a try. Merely, I&rsquo;m afraid that you will not be able to last should I give it a try,&rdquo; After saying those words, Li Anzhi&rsquo;s expression suddenly changed. The next moment, he unleashed his aura.<br>&ldquo;This?&rdquo;<br>After sensing Li Anzhi&rsquo;s aura, the crowd&rsquo;s expression all changed.<br>The reason for that was because Li Anzhi&rsquo;s aura was that of a rank seven Heavenly Immortal. His cultivation was an entire level above Chu Feng's.<br></p></div>
