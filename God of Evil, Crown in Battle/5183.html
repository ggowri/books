        <div>: Marriage?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This ancient remnant was discovered a long time ago, and much work had been done on it. It was more like a mine than anything else.<br>Chu Feng ventured deeper into the mine and soon saw a massive wall of Exalted Stone.<br>It harnessed the martial power comparable to Exalted level cultivators, but they weren&rsquo;t of much use to Chu Feng. It was something deeper inside the wall that was drawing him in.<br>Exalted Stones were harvested from this wall using spirit power. Chu Feng could mine much faster than the Nameless Sect and the Nine Levels Pavilion, but he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to reach the treasure hidden in the depths of the mine right away.<br>Thus, he took out the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk.<br>Fortunately, the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk willingly cooperated with him. It channeled its energy into the wall.<br>Kacha!<br>Kacha!<br>Cracks appeared on the surface of the wall, but they swiftly enlarged and crept deeper in. Eventually, a beam of light shone through the cracks.<br>Chu Feng stretched his hand into the crack and pulled a crystal out. He had no idea what this crystal was, but the martial power it harnessed was far greater than the Exalted Stone.<br>It was a cultivation treasure.<br>He took another look around the crack and confirmed that this was the only crystal inside the wall. To be clear, he hadn&rsquo;t reached the deepest layer of the mine yet, but what was drawing him in was indeed this crystal.<br>The moment he pulled out the crystal, he realized that the remaining Exalted Stone no longer held any appeal to him.<br>Taking another look at the crystal, he could tell that it was naturally formed.<br>This was an unexpected gain.<br>While there was a vast amount of Exalted Stones to be harvested from this mine, it was not of much use to his cultivation. He was also not in dire need of money either.<br>However, this crystal was a different matter. It harnessed a great amount of martial power and martial comprehension that made it an incredibly potent cultivation resource. Even if he was unable to make a breakthrough with this crystal, it would build a strong foundation for him.<br>Thus, he started cultivating with the crystal.<br>However, he soon discovered that there were impurities inside the crystal. It was still possible to cultivate with it, but its effectiveness would be undermined. To put the crystal to full use, he would have to first remove the impurities.<br>Thus, he stopped his cultivation and constructed a formation on top of the crystal. It would take some time to remove all of the impurities, but he believed that it would be worth the effort. All he had to do now was to wait till the crystal was ready.<br>So, he stowed the crystal away for the time being.<br>Three days passed in the blink of an eye.<br>Chu Feng thought that Old Cat would arrive later in the day, but unexpectedly, a towering silhouette appeared in the vicinity at the crack of dawn.<br>&ldquo;I have come as promised. Aren&rsquo;t you going to show yourself?&rdquo; Old Cat spoke aloud.<br>&ldquo;I have moved your disciple elsewhere, but his life is still in my grasp. If you don&rsquo;t want anything to happen to him, you better tell me what I want to know. Otherwise, you can be sure that he won&rsquo;t live past today,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>He didn&rsquo;t show himself, and he was still using his altered voice.<br>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t hurt my disciple. Tell me what you want in compensation; I&rsquo;ll give you whatever you want!&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>&ldquo;Like I&rsquo;ve said, you just need to answer my question,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>Old Cat was confused as to what Chu Feng was up to, but he still answered, &ldquo;Ask whatever you want. I&rsquo;ll tell you everything I know.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Where is Xue Ji?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Xue Ji? W-who are you?&rdquo;<br>Old Cat was stunned to hear that name. His voice was no longer as calm as before.<br>&ldquo;Have a good look at who I am.&rdquo;<br>This time, Chu Feng used his real voice and revealed himself.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you!!!&rdquo;<br>Old Cat was astonished to see Chu Feng. He did figure it out the moment Chu Feng mentioned Xue Ji, but this was simply too shocking to him.<br>&ldquo;How did you know young master Wolf is my disciple?&rdquo; Old Cat asked warily.<br>He thought that Chu Feng had intentionally provoked young master Wolf in order to lure him over.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of your business. What&rsquo;s important here is that your disciple is in my hands. If you want to ensure his safety, you&rsquo;d do well to tell me Xue Ji&rsquo;s whereabouts. If you dare escape or lie to me, that&rsquo;ll be the end of your disciple,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, Xue Ji really isn&rsquo;t in my hands! I didn&rsquo;t lie to you! She has already found her own place here. I introduced her to an excellent man. She&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy prestige like never before with him. Her cultivation will also grow faster than ever. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about her,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>&ldquo;Cut the crap and tell me where Xue Ji is. Where did you sell her to?&rdquo; Chu Feng roared angrily.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m doing this for your own good. You can&rsquo;t afford to offend that person. They are going to get married very soon&hellip; You should give up on her while you can. She&rsquo;s just a world spirit. You don&rsquo;t have to be so fixated on her when you have millions more in your World Spirit Space,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>&ldquo;Married?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was enraged to hear that word. Killing intent poured out from him as black gaseous flames blazed in his eyes. He had no idea just how terrifying he was at this very moment.<br>It was rare for Chu Feng to lose his temper like this.<br>Old Cat&rsquo;s heart lurched in horror upon sensing his killing intent. He had roamed the world of cultivation for many years, but not once had he felt such terrifying killing intent.<br>&ldquo;Calm down, Brother Chu Feng. Please don&rsquo;t hurt my disciple. I&rsquo;ll tell you where Xue Ji is!&rdquo; Old Cat exclaimed.<br></p></div>
