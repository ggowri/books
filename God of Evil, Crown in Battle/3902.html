        <h1>Chapter 3901</h1>
        <div> - Tragic Life<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Gou Za, is the sky here always like this?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Milord, we of the Dog Clan are sinners of the Galewind Hunting Clan. We are not qualified to see light, nor qualified to possess luxurious buildings.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The people from the Soldier Clan will come here to check things every month. If anyone dares to violate the rules, they will be severely punished.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, we can only live like this. Our lives are as Milord can see.&rdquo; Gou Za was actually smiling as he said those words. It would appear that he had grown accustomed to it.<br>His behavior was understandable. After all, he had lived there his entire life. Growing accustomed to it was natural.<br>As they say, if one has never witnessed light before, they will be able to endure darkness.<br>Likely, the reason why Gou Za and the others were able to endure the darkness was because they&rsquo;d never seen light before.<br>Seeing Gou Za like that, Chu Feng suddenly started feeling sympathy for him.<br>After all, the mistakes had been committed by their ancestors. They&rsquo;d never done anything wrong themselves.<br>However, all because of their ancestors' mistakes, Gou Za had been destined to live this sort of lowly life since the moment he was born.<br>Most lamentable of all, not only would he have to suffer like this for the rest of his life, but his descendants would also have to suffer like him.<br>Thinking of that, Chu Feng sighed emotionally in his heart.<br>It turned out that it was not only the human world that was cruel. The world of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms was equally cruel.<br>&ldquo;Milord, the entrance to the People Clan is behind those trash mountains.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Milord, is it possible for you to leave a bit later?&rdquo;<br>Gou Za revealed a hesitant look on his face as he said those words. Chu Feng was able to tell that he must have something that he wanted to tell him, but was afraid of saying.<br>&ldquo;Gou Za, do you have something you want to tell me?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Milord, is it possible for you to help this lowly one with something?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, if Milord is unwilling, you can very well consider what I&rsquo;ve said to be a fart.&rdquo;<br>Gou Za was trembling with fear as he said those words. He was filled with fear of Chu Feng. It seemed like he was deeply afraid of saying something wrong, and being beaten up for it.<br>&ldquo;What help do you need? Speak away.&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Milord, although my grandmother never explicitly said anything, and has been urging me that everything would be fine if I stay alive, that I do not have to pursue cultivation, I know that my grandmother always hoped that I would be able to grow up to be an outstanding warrior.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I am truly a disappointment. My talent is truly limited. I&rsquo;ve trained for a thousand years already. Yet, my cultivation is still this weak.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My grandmother&rsquo;s health is not good. I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll be able to live for much longer.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I want to make her happy. Thus, I hope that Milord is able to pretend to be my friend, and visit my grandmother as my friend.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If my grandmother sees that I&rsquo;ve actually become Milord&rsquo;s friend, she will definitely be overjoyed.&rdquo;<br>Gou Za did not dare to look Chu Feng in the face as he said those words. He was extremely afraid.<br>Not only was he afraid of Chu Feng rejecting him, but he was also afraid that Chu Feng would beat him up for making such a request.<br>Seeing Gou Za&rsquo;s tightly clenched hands, Chu Feng knew that he had gathered up all his courage to say those words.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Lead the way,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, you&hellip; you&rsquo;ve agreed to it?&rdquo;<br>Gou Za abruptly raised his head. The eyes with which he was looking at Chu Feng were sparkling with light. He simply did not dare to believe that Chu Feng had actually agreed to his demand.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you to lead the way. Do you not understand?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Yes yes. I will immediately lead the way for Milord. I will immediately lead the way.&rdquo;<br>Gou Za was overjoyed. As he spoke, he immediately began to guide Chu Feng.<br>Being guided by Gou Za, Chu Feng arrived at Gou Za&rsquo;s residence, and saw his grandmother.<br>Sure enough, it was as Gou Za had said, his grandmother&rsquo;s health was very bad. Fortunately, she was not sick. Instead, she had reached old age.<br>After Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother learned that Chu Feng was from the Soldier Clan and was Gou Za&rsquo;s friend, she was extremely happy.<br>She took out a pile of ugly-looking foodstuff to entertain Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng was able to guess that even though the food was very ugly-looking, it was extremely precious food in the Dog Nation.<br>After eating, Chu Feng chatted with Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother.<br>From their conversation, Chu Feng learned that their ancestors were actually from the Soldier Clan.<br>Unfortunately, the general that their ancestors followed had made a blunder. Because of that, even the Soldier Clansmen that had served under the general had been implicated.<br>Just like that, they had all been reduced to members of the Dog Clan.<br>During the year when Gou Za was born, his father and mother had been beaten to death in a scuffle for resources on the trash mountains.<br>Gou Za had been brought up fully by his grandmother.<br>&ldquo;What about his grandfather? Where did his grandfather go?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother.<br>&ldquo;Gou Za&rsquo;s grandfather was also beaten to death in a scramble for resources on the trash mountains,&rdquo; said Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother.<br>&ldquo;Who beat them to death? Are they also Dog Clansmen?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We do not dare to offend anyone from the People Clan. We dare not offend anyone from the Soldier Clan even more so. Thus, how could we possibly dare to fight over resources with them?&rdquo; said Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother.<br>&ldquo;Does no one care that people are being beaten to death?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No one cares. The people of the Dog Clan are the most inferior existences of the Galewind Hunting Clan. Simply no one cares if we live or die.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The only thing they care about is the assurance that we continue to live lowly like a bunch of feral dogs.&rdquo; Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother had a look of helplessness on her face as she said those words.<br>&ldquo;I will definitely avenge them,&rdquo; Right at that moment, Gou Za spoke out.<br>He had a look of determination on his face as he said those words. Chu Feng could tell that he was serious.<br>&ldquo;Gou Za, you absolutely must not say those words again. Do you remember how many times your grandma had to beg them not to kill you? Yet you&rsquo;re actually still thinking of revenge?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Continue to live properly. Do not stir up trouble. Do not provoke them. Grandma will thank you profusely if you do all that.&rdquo;<br>Compared to the hate-filled Gou Za, Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother was fully against it. It was like she had no desire for revenge herself.<br>After reprimanding Gou Za, Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother looked to Chu Feng. Respect and gratitude filled her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Milord, Gou Za told me in the past that he befriended a lord from the Soldier Clan. At that time, I didn&rsquo;t believe him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With how lowly we of the Dog Clan are, not even those from the People Clan are willing to befriend us. Thus, how could the distinguished lords of the Soldier Clan possibly be willing to befriend us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I truly never would&rsquo;ve image this stinky brat Gou Za to actually possess the ability to make Milord approve of him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Seeing that Gou Za has a friend like Milord, I am truly at ease.&rdquo;<br>Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother spoke in a very gratified manner.<br>&ldquo;Gou Za, scram out for your daddy!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a furious shout was heard. Looking towards the voice, Chu Feng could see a group of people rushing over aggressively.<br>Seeing their outfits, Chu Feng could tell that they were also from the Dog Clan. Furthermore, their cultivations were not strong either. They were all Heavenly Immortals. However, amongst them, one had a cultivation stronger than Gou Za.<br>Gou Za was a rank seven Heavenly Immortal, whereas that person was a rank eight Heavenly Immortal.<br>As for the other people, they were generally rank four or five Heavenly Immortals. Only a few people were rank six Heavenly Immortals.<br>However, those people were all rushing over aggressively, and coming straight for Gou Za.<br>Their aggressive nature was truly quite frightening.<br>Hearing those people&rsquo;s shouts, Gou Za&rsquo;s neighbors all walked out.<br>However, it seemed like Gou Za&rsquo;s neighbors did not intend to help him. Instead, they shouted at Gou Za&rsquo;s residence as if they were watching a show.<br>&ldquo;Hey! Gou Za, what sort of trouble did you court this time?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Gou Za, your grandmother&rsquo;s about to die. Can you stop making her kneel and beg for you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Beg? Even if she is to kowtow till she dies, it&rsquo;ll be useless. Look who those people are, they&rsquo;re Gou Zhen and his lackeys.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Gou Zhen and his lackeys show no mercy to anyone. Gou Za actually offended them, he has simply grown tired of living.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, all sorts of voices sounded nonstop. They were all making cutting remarks and sneering at Gou Za.<br></p></div>
