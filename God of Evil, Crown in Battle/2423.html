        <h1>Chapter 2422</h1>
        <div> - Imminent War<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>After Kong Shunlian deliberately spread the news of Chu Feng and Wang Qiang leaving the Kong Heavenly Clan, everyone soon came to know about it.<br>The people outside the Kong Heavenly Clan were confused as to why Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were leaving. However, the people staying in the Kong Heavenly Clan as guests were all able to call the reason to mind.<br>The way they saw it, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were originally the most honored of all honored guests to have appeared in the Kong Heavenly Clan. However, they had been provoked by Kong Ruozeng. Thus, it could be said that they had not received the treatment they should have received as honored guests.<br>Even if it were anyone else, they too would be angered, and would most likely no longer want to stay.<br>However, they had no idea that the actual reason why Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were leaving was because a great catastrophe was going to befall them.<br>The Kong Heavenly Clan wanted to kill Chu Feng and Wang Qiang. The decision to leave was the only way out for them.<br>Furthermore, they could not publicise this matter; they must conceal the fact that the Kong Heavenly Clan wanted to kill them.<br>If this matter were to be made public, the Kong Heavenly Clan would disregard everything and openly kill Chu Feng and Wang Qiang.<br>After the news of their departure was announced, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang publicly left the Kong Heavenly Clan.<br>As for Kong Shunlian, he gave the reason that he did not want others to bother Chu Feng and Wang Qiang to escort them away.<br>With a True Immortal-level expert bringing Chu Feng and Wang Qiang away, they instantly disappeared. As such, the guests that wanted to curry favor relationships with Chu Feng and Wang Qiang no longer possessed the opportunity to do so.<br>One by one, they all prepared to leave that place with disappointment in their hearts.<br>However, right at the moment when the crowd was planning to leave, a sudden voice transmission entered the guests&rsquo; ears.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, don&rsquo;t be so urgent to leave. Instead, pretend to leave and then proceed toward the southeast. At that place&hellip; not only will you all see little friends Chu Feng and Wang Qiang, you will also be able to see the true identity of the Kong Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>Once that voice sounded, everyone that heard that voice transmission revealed a change in expression. Some people even planned to question who it was that had sent the voice transmission.<br>However, the following moment, that voice sounded in the crowd&rsquo;s ears again.<br>&ldquo;Do not ask who I am, and do not disclose what I have said. Else&hellip; none of you will be able to see anything, and you may even&hellip; face life-threatening danger.&rdquo;<br>Regarding those words, some people felt it to be a prank. Although they did not disclose it, they also did not believe it, and decided to leave directly.<br>However, there were also a lot of people that did believe it. After all, they had waited for Chu Feng for such a long time already.<br>If they were to leave now, they would really have come here for nothing.<br>However, if they were to listen to the person who had sent that voice transmission and proceed toward the southeast, they would, at the very least, have a chance of seeing Chu Feng again. Thus, they all wanted to give it a try.<br>&hellip;...<br>At that moment, Kong Shunlian was escorting Chu Feng and Wang Qiang and rapidly heading toward the southeast.<br>The speed of True Immortals was truly fast. In merely the blink of an eye, they had left the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s range of influence.<br>However, Kong Shunlian suddenly stopped. With an ice-cold gaze, he stared into the empty sky behind him. He said, &ldquo;Why have you been following me this entire time?&rdquo;<br>Once Kong Shunlian said those words, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang&rsquo;s hearts tightened. Chu Feng also started to tightly grip the Evil God Sword he held in his hand. They had both become aware that the situation was amiss.<br>Sure enough, after Kong Shunlian said those words, the sky that originally did not have a single soul in sight started to tremble slightly. Soon, three figures appeared.<br>These three people were all Supreme Elders of the Kong Heavenly Clan. Like Kong Shunlian, they were all True Immortal-level experts.<br>Two among them were individuals who had just left closed-door training. As for the third individual, the person leading the group of three, he was Kong Moyu.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shunlian, if you do not act now, how long are you planning to wait?&rdquo; Kong Moyu said to Kong Shunlian.<br>&ldquo;I said that I&rsquo;ll do it, so I&rsquo;ll definitely do it. You, on the other hand, why did you follow me? Could it be that you do not trust me?&rdquo; Kong Shunlian asked coldly. At that moment, dense anger filled his gaze.<br>&ldquo;It is not that we do not trust you. Merely, Chu Feng&rsquo;s life and death concerns our clan&rsquo;s continued existence. As such, we must treat this matter cautiously,&rdquo; Kong Moyu said with a light smile. Then, he said, &ldquo;Go on. Kill him. Do it, and everything will be settled.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;G-go f-fuck yourself! My b-brother&rsquo;s life and death concerns y-your clan&rsquo;s con-continued existence? Do y-you think my b-brother is your ancestor?&rdquo; Wang Qiang cursed loudly.<br>&ldquo;What insolence!&rdquo; Kong Moyu narrowed his eyebrows. He did not raise any wind or move any clouds. There was no change to heaven and earth. In fact, one could not feel the slightest bit of martial power.<br>However, at that moment, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang both felt an extremely frightening killing intent moving toward them from all sides.<br>That killing intent was extremely powerful. It was as if, in the very next moment, they would die without a corpse remaining.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Kong Shunlian, who stood before Chu Feng and Wang Qiang, raised his arm. Immediately, the killing intent disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Kong Moyu, what is the meaning of this?&rdquo; Kong Shunlian asked coldly.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang came to a realization that the frightening killing intent they felt earlier had not been a baseless sensation.<br>Rather, it had been caused by Kong Moyu.<br>Without even moving, Kong Moyu was able to emit a killing intent that frightening. Furthermore, he did not cause the slightest change to the weather around them.<br>Fortunately, Kong Shunlian was there. Else, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang would most likely be dead already.<br>Thus, Chu Feng started to grip his Evil God Sword even tighter. He was uncertain as to whether or not his Evil God Sword would be able to contend against True Immortals.<br>After all, True Immortals were existences that had surpassed the limits of mortals. The title of &lsquo;Immortal&rsquo; was not a baseless claim. They were indeed extremely powerful.<br>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this? That is what I should be asking you. It&rsquo;s one thing for you to not kill them, but you actually dare to stop me from killing them. Sure enough, you were planning to escort them away, and not actually trying to help our clan eliminate harm,&rdquo; Kong Moyu said angrily.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shunlian, the safety of our clan surpasses everything else. You should quickly settle them. Else&hellip; do not blame us for not taking our old affection into consideration.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Shunlian, you&rsquo;re on your own.&rdquo;<br>The other two Supreme Elders also spoke.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the already furious Kong Shunlian raised his mouth into a smile. Following that, the anger in his eyes grew even more intense.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Kong Shunlian flipped his palm, and a silver spear appeared in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Once that spear appeared, the weather immediately changed. Lightning flashed and thunder rolled. It was as if the entire world was being controlled by Kong Shunlian&rsquo;s weapon.<br>It was an Ancestral Armament, an actual Ancestral Armament.<br>Being held by Kong Shunlian, that Ancestral Armament was able to completely unleash the pinnacle of its power.<br>&ldquo;I am the one who invited the two of them here. I have sworn that I will ensure their safety.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you all insist on killing them, you must kill me first,&rdquo; Kong Shunlian said.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, you&rsquo;re planning to betray our clan,&rdquo; At that moment, dense killing intent emerged in Kong Moyu&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, Kong Moyu and the other two Supreme Elders also took out their respective Ancestral Armaments.<br>At that moment, the entire region was controlled by the aura of four True Immortal-level experts. Violent wind burst forth, and torrential rain dashed down. Even the earth itself was trembling violently. In fact, even the space around them started to shatter.<br>It was as if that region would be turned into hell the next moment.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shunlian, you must consider this properly. To betray one&rsquo;s clan is an enormous crime. We possess the authority to execute you on the spot,&rdquo; An Supreme Elder said.<br>&ldquo;Even if I am to die, I will still protect the two of them, allowing their safe departure,&rdquo; Kong Shunlian said.<br>Kong Shunlian was very calm when he said those words. It could be seen that he had already made his decision.<br>Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were moved. As matters stood, they were able to ascertain of Kong Shunlian&rsquo;s character.<br>To think that Kong Shunlian would actually fall out with his clan for the two of them, two outsiders, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were extremely moved.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shunlian, although we&rsquo;re all rank one True Immortals, you&rsquo;re going against three by yourself. Say&hellip; how certain are you in being able to defeat us?&rdquo; The other Supreme Elder mocked.<br>The intention behind his words was that Kong Shunlian would definitely be defeated.<br>&ldquo;Who told you that he was fighting against three by himself?&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice suddenly sounded from behind Kong Moyu and the others.<br><br></p></div>
