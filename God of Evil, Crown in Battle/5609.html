        <h1>Chapter 5609: The Two Men In the Desert</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were different tiers to the tokens available in this land. These tokens were keys to the upcoming fortuitous encounter. The better the token, the greater the rewards from the fortuitous encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Chu Feng activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes and even brought out the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk. Interestingly enough, the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk chose to provide him some guidance this time around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng followed the guidance of the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk and left the jungle to enter a desert. A sandstorm was raging in the desert, limiting the visibility of those venturing into the area. This wasn&rsquo;t an ideal place to go around looking for tokens or fortuitous encounters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chu Feng was still able to spot some clues through his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes. He chose not to rely on his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes though, since the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk was already providing him clear directions as to where he should head to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The desert was much larger than Chu Feng had expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sandstorm grew larger as he ventured deeper into the desert, to the point where he could hardly see anything beyond ten meters of him even with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was even more frustrating was how the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk stopped working at some point. Chu Feng did some experiments and deduced that there was something in the desert that was restricting the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he retreated a little, the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk would show its guidance once more. However, the guidance quickly disappeared when he ventured deeper into the desert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;As expected of a formation from Elder Chaotic Era Scholar. It&rsquo;s able to restrict even the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk.&rdquo; Knowing that he could only rely on himself from this point onward, Chu Feng activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eye and carefully examined his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, can&rsquo;t you follow the last direction pointed out by the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk? There&rsquo;s no need for you to figure out your own path,&rdquo; Eggy asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The formation here can&rsquo;t be that simple, or else there&rsquo;s no need for Elder Chaotic Era Scholar to go to the trouble of limiting the effectiveness of the Heavenly Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk here. Even if the last direction pointed out by the Heavenly Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk is accurate, it&rsquo;s possible that there might be some kind of arrangement in the desert formation that interferes with that,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like you&rsquo;re getting more and more careful. That&rsquo;s a good thing,&rdquo; Eggy complimented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she was in Chu Feng&rsquo;s place, she would have simply followed the direction pointed out by the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk. It had proven on many occasions that it was much more potent than Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng knew that too, but he thought that it was still better to proceed carefully. Fearing that he might miss out on something, he had to travel much slower than </span><span>before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he gathered from his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes told him that he needed to change his direction along the way. It was just a small deviation, but he wouldn&rsquo;t be traveling in the direction pointed out by the Heavenly Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Eggy, my observations from Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes tell me that I need to change our direction of travel. Should I follow the guidance from the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk or my observation from Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes?&rdquo; Chu Feng was put at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already spent quite some time venturing this far, and there was something weird about the sandstorm here. If he made the wrong decision, he would likely have to return to where he came from and start anew. The wasted time might disadvantage him in clinching the fortuitous encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Trust your intuition, Chu Feng,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow my observations from Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes then,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Eggy nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng followed the direction he had deduced from his observations through Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes. This time around, he quickly encountered a mysterious boulder that emanated peculiar energy that halted the sandstorm in its vicinity. This allowed him to take a proper look at the boulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boulder was oval like an egg, but it towered over a hundred meters in height. It was very hard, such that even a True God level cultivator wouldn&rsquo;t be able to break it. However, there was an opening in its formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through observing the boulder&rsquo;s patterns, shape, color gradient, and all kinds of information, Chu Feng quickly figured out the way to decipher the boulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boulder was clearly the greatest fortuitous encounter in this desert. Even if it didn&rsquo;t contain the best token, it would likely have some kind of treasure inside it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was also a piece of bad news&mdash;there were two men standing before the boulder, keenly observing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them had fair skin and white hair, but he was dressed in black. His eyes were hidden behind a black cloth, which had glowing runes on it. The cloth hindered Chu Feng&rsquo;s vision, preventing him from seeing the man&rsquo;s eyes. While the black cloth obscured some of the man&rsquo;s facial features, his other visible features suggested that he was very good-looking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other man had black skin and hair, but he was dressed in a spotless white robe. It was a rather peculiar contrast, but he looked dashing as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them looked young, but for some reason, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t sense their auras at all, which meant that he couldn&rsquo;t confirm their cultivation or whether they were juniors at all. Regardless, the fact that the two of them stumbled upon this boulder before him showed that they were no ordinary individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men noticed Chu Feng as well and turned around to assess him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect someone else to be competent enough to find this place,&rdquo; the white-robed man remarked in surprise, though there was also a hint of disdain in his words.</span></p></div>
