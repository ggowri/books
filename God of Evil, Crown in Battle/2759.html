        <div> - Revealing The Secret<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>After that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder approached, Elder Xingyi asked, &ldquo;Exactly what is it that made you all refuse to let others climb the mountain?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is a decision that our clan&rsquo;s Lord Clan Chief and Supreme Elders made,&rdquo; The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clansman said.<br>&ldquo;What sort of decision?&rdquo; Elder Xingyi asked.<br>&ldquo;Regarding this&hellip;&rdquo; The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder revealed a difficult expression.<br>&ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; Elder Xingyi&rsquo;s gaze turned sharp.<br>The expression of fear on that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder grew even more intense. He did not dare to hesitate, and immediately said, &ldquo;A choice. It is a choice.&rdquo;<br>He was extremely afraid of Elder Xingyi.<br>&ldquo;What sort of choice? Speak clearly,&rdquo; Elder Xingyi spoke impatiently.<br>&ldquo;This time around, our clan&rsquo;s Lord Clan Chief and Supreme Elders have jointly set up these spirit formations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They have also set up a grand maze formation on the heaven-reaching mountain range. If one were to enter the mountain range, one would have entered the maze. Only by walking out of the maze would one be able to enter Buried Spirit Lake.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise&hellip; one will be trapped in the maze formation until it disappears by itself. Only then would one be able to escape the maze,&rdquo; That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br>&ldquo;What sort of nonsense is this? Isn&rsquo;t this deliberately making things difficult for others?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Why have we traveled far and wide to come here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We have all come here for the sake of Buried Spirit Lake. Yet now, you&rsquo;re telling us that we will have to go through some sort of maze in order to enter it. Isn&rsquo;t this a clear act of bullying?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, many people present were unable to contain themselves, and started to voice their displeasure.<br>&ldquo;One will also have to attempt to gain comprehension after entering Buried Spirit Lake. If one cannot comprehend anything, entering Buried Spirit Lake will be meaningless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although Buried Spirit Lake is the most precious aspect of the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain, the power contained in Buried Spirit Lake has been growing weaker and weaker. In turn, it is becoming more and more difficult for one to obtain comprehension from it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If one&rsquo;s comprehension ability is insufficient, one will not be able to obtain anything even after entering it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I believe this is not the first time for many of the people here to arrive at our Spirit Formation Immortal Domain. You have all entered Buried Spirit Lake before too. Likely, you&rsquo;ve all returned empty-handed, right?&rdquo; That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder looked to the crowd as he said those words.<br>At that moment, many people lowered their heads. It was as that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said, the power of Buried Spirit Lake had been decreasing. If one did not possess sufficient comprehension, even if one were to enter Buried Spirit Lake and encounter the erupting power, one would not be able to comprehend anything.<br>Thus, many people ended up returning empty-handed.<br>&ldquo;Thus, this time around, our Lord Clan Chief has decided to give everyone a choice,&rdquo; That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br>&ldquo;Choice? What sort of choice?&rdquo; The crowd asked.<br>&ldquo;Apart from setting up a maze formation, our Lord Clan Chief and Supreme Elders have also set up a grand formation outside this heaven-reaching mountain range.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That grand formation was set up by integrating with the special power of the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain. If one is to enter that spirit formation, one will most definitely gain a harvest. Of course, that harvest will be dependent on everyone&rsquo;s comprehension ability.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That being said, the power of that spirit formation will intensify when the power within Buried Spirit Lake erupts. Compared to entering Buried Spirit Lake, the harvest from that spirit formation will likely be bigger,&rdquo; That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br>&ldquo;In other words, if we choose to ascend the mountain, we will not be able to enter that spirit formation to train. If we choose to enter that spirit formation, we will not be able to climb the mountain?&rdquo; Someone asked.<br>&ldquo;That is precisely the case,&rdquo; That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, you should&rsquo;ve told us that directly. Why did you leave us out to dry here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; The crowd echoed in a very displeased manner.<br>&ldquo;Actually, I shouldn&rsquo;t have told you about this at all. According to the orders of our Lord Clan Chief, you will all soon enter a spirit formation. Upon entering it, you will be able to choose between two paths. One path will lead to the cultivation formation, while the other one will lead to the maze formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, regardless of which path you choose, you will not be able to turn around.&rdquo;<br>After that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder finished saying those words, he looked to Elder Xingyi.<br>At that moment, the crowd present all came to understand.<br>This was a game set up by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan. It would all be dependent on them as to how they would play the game.<br>The words spoken by that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder earlier had revealed the most crucial secret regarding the game.<br>It was all thanks to Elder Xingyi that the crowd was able to be fortunate enough to know about that crucial secret.<br>Thus, at that moment, the crowd all cast thankful gazes toward Elder Xingyi.<br>Right at that moment, Han Yu stood forth. With an extremely ill-intended gaze, he said, &ldquo;Elder, you spoke those words in such a matter-of-course manner, but do you really think that your clan&rsquo;s actions are correct?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Spirit Formation Immortal Domain has existed since the Ancient Era. It has always been deemed as a sacred training ground by the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s many world spiritists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet now, your Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan has altered the rules to enter Buried Spirit Lake of your own accord. Do you all really think that your actions were right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How is it not right?&rdquo; Right at that moment, a loud and resounding voice was suddenly heard.<br>At the same time as that voice was heard, a figure appeared before the crowd.<br>It was another Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clansman. Merely, compared to the other Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clansman, he was much bigger and more robust. Furthermore, his outfit was also very distinctive.<br>On his body was a suit of golden armor. On his head was a golden crown. Draped over his shoulders was a red mantle. Adding on to the tall and robust build that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clansman possessed, he appeared especially domineering as he stood there.<br>Most importantly, that individual&rsquo;s aura was extremely deep and robust. When he appeared, he completely overshadowed everyone present.<br>Even the Starfall Eight Immortals were unable to match his aura.<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing that individual, Han Yu&rsquo;s expression changed greatly. Chu Feng was able to clearly see a single emotion in his eyes: fear.<br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to Lord Clan Chief.&rdquo;<br>After that individual appeared, all of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clansmen hurriedly half-kneeled onto the ground and greeted that individual respectfully.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng realized who that domineering existence was without even needing an introduction.<br>Evidently, he was the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s clan chief.<br>&ldquo;The Spirit Formation Immortal Domain is our Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s territory. We possess absolute authority over the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We can do whatever we wish. Even if we are to decide to not allow you all to enter this place, you all will not be able to enter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I would like to ask instead, what wrong did our Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan commit?&rdquo;<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief stared closely at Han Yu with his sharp and domineering gaze.<br>&ldquo;This junior was hot-headed. I hope senior does not take offense,&rdquo; Han Yu hurriedly clasped his fist and admitted his mistake. He did not even dare to raise his head.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng noticed that not only was Han Yu&rsquo;s expression ugly, he was also sweating cold beads.<br>His pride and arrogance had disappeared completely. At that moment, the only thing remaining in him was fear.<br>After Han Yu apologized sincerely, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief merely glared at him once and then decided to pay no more attention to him.<br>&ldquo;Does anyone else have an objection?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief turned his gaze to the crowd. It was an extremely dominating gaze. It was as if he did not place anyone here in his eyes.<br>Furthermore, he kept the same gaze the entire time. Not only did he turn that sort of gaze at Chu Feng and the others, but his gaze remained the same even when it landed on the Starfall Eight Immortals.<br>In other words, he did not place the Starfall Eight Immortals in his eyes either.<br>No one answered his question. Not even the Starfall Eight Immortals answered him.<br>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s no objection, then comply with the rules of our Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan. I will remind you all of this: if anyone dares to pester us endlessly again, do not blame our Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan for becoming impolite.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although it is true that those who have arrived are guests, I must remind everyone of one phrase too. That is, guests should follow the rules of the host.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I hope that no one creates inconveniences and troubles for our Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan.&rdquo;<br>After the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief finished saying those words, he turned around and looked to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder that had explained what was happening to Chu Feng and the others.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, he shot forth his fist. His fist directly knocked that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder several meters away. When he landed, he was completely bloodied, and his breathing had ceased.<br>&ldquo;A disgrace to our Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan. Toss him into the Traitor&rsquo;s Pool.&rdquo;<br>After the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief finished saying those words, he waved his sleeve, soared into the sky and left without a second thought.<br>He left behind a completely stunned crowd.<br><br><br></p></div>
