        <h1>Chapter 3447</h1>
        <div> - Important Guest<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Enough of your bullshit! Xu Morong, I&rsquo;m warning you! If you dare to bother my big sister again, I will teach you a lesson!&rdquo; Gong Qing pointed at Xu Morong and shouted angrily.<br>&ldquo;Damned brat, watch your tone when speaking to our young master!&rdquo; At that moment, the Xu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations that stood behind Xu Morong were unable to contain themselves. Their appearances were so vicious that it seemed like they were planning to attack Gong Qing.<br>&ldquo;Hey! Watch your tone when speaking with my two little sisters!&rdquo; Xu Morong suddenly shouted angrily at his men, &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you apologizing?!&rdquo;<br>After Xu Morong spoke, the Xu Heavenly Clansman that had shouted at Gong Qing earlier actually really ended up apologizing.<br>It could be seen that Xu Morong truly enjoyed a high status within the Xu Heavenly Clan.<br>However, Gong Qing did not appreciate Xu Morong&rsquo;s action at all, and began to walk away.<br>This time, Xu Morong did not give chase. Instead, he looked to Gong Mingyue and Gong Qing&rsquo;s rear with interest. A vulgar smile was present on his face.<br>&ldquo;Brother Xu, those two girls are quite decent. Unfortunately&hellip; it seems like they&rsquo;re giving you the cold shoulder,&rdquo; someone arrived beside Xu Morong and said quietly. There was a trace of mockery in his tone.<br>&ldquo;There are no women that I, Xu Morong, cannot obtain. One day, I'll make those two sisters serve me together,&rdquo; said Xu Morong.<br>&ldquo;I know of brother Xu&rsquo;s capabilities. You will definitely be able to succeed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Brother Xu, the matters regarding Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son that you mentioned earlier, is that true?&rdquo; That man continued to ask.<br>&ldquo;How could I lie about that? When have I, Xu Morong, ever lied to you all?&rdquo; Xu Morong said.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a ray of light appeared at the top of the peach garden. The area being illuminated by the light grew wider and wider.<br>Soon, a spherical object appeared in the light.<br>That spherical object seemed like some sort of plant. However, it was enormous in size, and looked like a small palace floating in midair.<br>&ldquo;It appeared! It&rsquo;s the Peach Garden Mystic Realm.&rdquo;<br>Once that object appeared, practically everyone turned their eyes up toward it. Anticipation filled their eyes.<br>&ldquo;Big sister, is that the legendary Peach Garden Mystic Realm?&rdquo; Gong Qing asked Gong Mingyue.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s the Peach Garden Mystic Realm that contains martial cultivation mysteries,&rdquo; Gong Mingyue said.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected the Tantai Heavenly Clan to actually summon the Peach Garden Mystic Realm. Could it be&hellip; that Miss Tantai Xing&rsquo;er is planning to allow us to enter it to observe?&rdquo; Gong Qing asked.<br>&ldquo;Foolish girl, summoning the Peach Garden Mystic Realm will require over ten thousand Purple-marked Spirit Stones. Furthermore, teleporting a single person into the Peach Garden Mystic Realm will cost a hundred thousand Purple-marked Spirit Stones. Do you think that, with such an expensive price, the Tantai Heavenly Clan will be willing to let us enter it?&rdquo; Gong Mingyue asked.<br>&ldquo;The price is actually that expensive?&rdquo; Gong Qing made an expression of shock.<br>Purple-marked Spirit Stones were a sort of spirit stone that originated from the Ancient Era. Purple-marked Spirit Stones were very precious. Each one of them could be said to be invaluable. It was even more so for ten thousand or a hundred thousand such stones.<br>Thus, after hearing what Gong Mingyue said, Gong Qing was certain that they would have no chance to enter the Peach Garden Mystic Realm.<br>&ldquo;Big sister, since they&rsquo;re not planning to let us enter it, why did the Tantai Heavenly Clan summon the Peach Garden Mystic Realm? Could it be merely to show off their strength? But&hellip; is it really worth spending ten thousand Purple-marked Spirit Stones, such an extravagant amount of wealth, to show off their strength?&rdquo; Gong Qing asked.<br>&ldquo;Foolish girl, how could the Tantai Heavenly Clan need to show off their strength?&rdquo; Gong Mingyue said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Gong Qing smiled foolishly, &ldquo;Then what is going on?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that Miss Tantai Xing&rsquo;er has held this gathering of the younger generation for a certain individual. Likely, that Peach Garden Mystic Realm is also prepared for that person,&rdquo; Gong Mingyue said.<br>&ldquo;Who? Who could possibly have such face? Could it be&hellip; Linghu Hongfei?&rdquo; Gong Qing asked.<br>&ldquo;No idea. However, to be able to be valued in such a manner by Miss Tantai Xing&rsquo;er, even if that person isn&rsquo;t Linghu Hongfei, that person would still be someone extraordinary,&rdquo; said Gong Mingyue.<br>It was not only Gong Mingyue who gasped in admiration, as many others in the peach garden had also heard the rumors that Tantai Xing&rsquo;er had held this gathering for an important guest.<br>As such, the crowd were all making guesses as to who that important guest might be.<br>Even the insufferably arrogant Xu Morong spoke to his gang of scoundrels with a serious expression, &ldquo;Brothers, let me tell you all this. I&rsquo;ve received news that the important guest invited by Miss Tantai Xing&rsquo;er today is not Linghu Hongfei. However, that person is also a dragon among men. It's not that I am looking down on you all, however, once that person arrives, you all will be destined to be overshadowed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, what about you, young master Xu?&rdquo; Someone asked curiously.<br>Xu Morong chuckled. Then, he said, &ldquo;Very rarely do I, Xu Morong, submit to others. However, I&rsquo;ve submitted to Miss Tantai Xing&rsquo;er. As it&rsquo;s a guest that even Miss Tantai Xing&rsquo;er thinks so highly of, then, no matter how confident I, Xu Morong, might be, I will still know my place. Naturally&hellip; I'm also unable to compare to that important guest.&rdquo;<br>After Xu Morong said those words, his gang of scoundrels began to look forward to that legendary guest even more.<br>After all, very few people were able to obtain such an acknowledgement from Xu Morong.<br></p></div>
