        <div> - Ancient Compliance Castle<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior, what is that?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but turn to Grandmaster Tang Chen to inquire about the incoming colossus.<br>He had discovered that the man-made colossus was protected by a spirit formation.<br>That spirit formation was extremely powerful, and far surpassed Chu Feng&rsquo;s ability to see through.<br>With Chu Feng&rsquo;s current ability, he was simply unable to see through the spirit formation.<br>Furthermore, the spirit formation was very well-hidden. If one didn&rsquo;t observe the colossus carefully, they wouldn't be able to detect the spirit formation at all.<br>Furthermore, after careful observation, Chu Feng was shocked to discover that the colossus actually contained an Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura.<br>This meant that even if the master of the colossus was a modern cultivator, the colossus itself was something that had most likely originated from the Ancient Era.<br>This meant that it was a treasure in itself.<br>Chu Feng had never seen such an enormous treasure.<br>On top of that, it was composed of an extremely peculiar composition capable of causing one to be lost in wild and fanciful thoughts.<br>As such, compared to the master of the colossus, Chu Feng was more interested in the origin of the colossus itself.<br>&ldquo;That is the Ancient Compliance Castle. It is Old Man Compliance&rsquo;s temporary residence.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Old Man Compliance is not only a Martial Exalted-level expert, his world spirit techniques had also reached rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation many years ago.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Grandmaster Tang Chen lowered his voice before continuing, &ldquo;Furthermore, according to this old man&rsquo;s speculation, that old codger&rsquo;s world spirit techniques could have very possibly have reached rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Would that mean that he&rsquo;s an existence on the same level as senior?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Stop flattering me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could I possibly compare to him? Old Man Compliance is a true hidden expert of the Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He does not involve himself in any of the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s matters. He also won't step into any remnants or places with treasures. Furthermore, he appears and disappears unpredictably, like a ghost.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng grew even more curious after hearing those words.<br>It turned out that not only was the mobile palace mysterious, its owner was also rather mysterious too.<br>&ldquo;Senior, why are there so many people surrounding the Ancient Compliance Castle?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re acting like that Ancient Compliance Castle will present them with some sort of benefit?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>A huge commotion was created by the appearance of the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>At that moment it was being surrounded by a great number of world spiritists.<br>Although they were surrounding the Ancient Compliance Castle, they were also keeping their distance from it.<br>It seemed like they were waiting for something.<br>Judging from the excitement that those world spiritists were showing, it seemed like they were waiting for some sort of benefit.<br>&ldquo;The reason why the Ancient Compliance Castle is called that, and the reason why Old Man Compliance is called as such, is all because of the word &lsquo;Compliance,&rsquo;&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen stroked his beard in a deliberately mystifying manner.<br>&ldquo;Compliance?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s curiosity was roused. He was unable to take his eyes off Grandmaster Tang Chen, and awaited an answer.<br>&ldquo;Old Man Compliance&rsquo;s real name is Feng Moran.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back then, by fate, he had obtained that ancient mobile castle.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That ancient castle contained an inexplicable power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;One thing worthy of mentioning is there&rsquo;s a mirror inside the ancient castle. Should one stand before that mirror, the mirror will illuminate the treasure that that person needs the most.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, that&rsquo;s assuming that the ancient castle possesses that treasure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, the ancient castle is filled with treasures. Likely, not even Old Man Compliance himself knows how many treasures there are.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The ancient castle does not have a name. It only possesses a single signboard. On that signboard the words 'Heavenly Compliance God' are carved.<br>&ldquo;Old Man Compliance believed the Heavenly Compliance god to be the owner of the ancient castle. On top of that, there&rsquo;s that special mirror.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, he decided to name the ancient castle the Ancient Compliance Castle. From that day on, he also addressed himself as Old Man Compliance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, it should actually be mentioned that he was actually very young back then,&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen said with a faint smile.<br>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that the Ancient Compliance Castle has numerous treasures, and is a treasure trove itself?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct. There were people that had wanted to steal the Ancient Compliance Castle from Old Man Compliance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should know that the martial cultivation world is one with no lack of greedy individuals. It was even more so when it&rsquo;s a treasure trove from the Ancient Era.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, without exception, all those that forcibly attacked the Ancient Compliance Castle were met with failure. They either died or were injured.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Ancient Compliance Castle contains great power. It could be said that the Ancient Compliance Castle is as dangerous as the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even for Martial Exalted-level experts, three were killed by the Ancient Compliance Castle.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a greater number than the amount of Martial Exalted-level experts killed by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that powerful?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was curious about the Ancient Compliance Castle to begin with. Now that he had heard this description from Grandmaster Tang Chen, he had grown even more curious.<br>&ldquo;The reason why those people all wanted to enter the Ancient Compliance Castle was because of that mirror.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should one be able to successfully enter the Ancient Compliance Castle, they would be able to stand before the mirror.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That mirror will match one with the most suitable treasure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, one will have to rely on their own ability to obtain that treasure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, there&rsquo;s a requirement. Only those under six hundred years of age are allowed to step into the Ancient Compliance Castle,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Why under six hundred?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But, it&rsquo;s said that Old Man Compliance had obtained the Ancient Compliance Treasure when he was exactly six hundred years old.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the exact reason why, no one knows.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not even Old Man Compliance knows,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very interesting.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes continued to examine the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>The Ancient Compliance Castle was now very close to Chu Feng.<br>Even though he had discovered that it possessed a boundless imposing aura, the oppressive sensation emitted by it was vastly different when it was near than when it was far away.<br>It was still unknown what the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain was like.<br>But, the Ancient Compliance Castle had given Chu Feng an impression of the fascination of the martial cultivation world.<br>Another treasure from the Ancient Era.<br>Another puzzle that modern cultivators could not decipher.<br>At the same time, he was reminded of just how small he was. Chu Feng grew motivated.<br>&ldquo;Jingle, jingle---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the bells on the Ancient Compliance Castle started to ring rhythmically.<br>Then, three flags rose from the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>The three flags were all raised on the back of the colossus.<br>Each flag measured over a thousand meters in height. Moving with the wind, the flags appeared extremely impressive.<br>When he saw the three flags, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze changed.<br>He discovered that there were two words written on one of the flags.<br>Lu Jie!<br>&ldquo;Lu Jie?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng knew of Lu Jie. He was one of the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted&rsquo;s disciples.<br>He was also deemed to be the most talented world spiritist among the people of the younger generation.<br>Through the conversations that they'd had in their days traveling together, Chu Feng had also learned of Lu Jie&rsquo;s special significance to Yuan Shu.<br>Back then, both Lu Jie and Yuan Shu had been deemed people of the younger generation with the greatest talent for world spirit techniques.<br>Unfortunately, Lu Jie&rsquo;s talent had remained exceptional, whereas Yuan Shu's had gradually fallen short.<br>At present, there was an enormous disparity between Lu Jie and Yuan Shu, two geniuses of a similar age.<br>Even though Yuan Shu always had a relaxed smile on his face when Lu Jie was mentioned, Chu Feng could tell from the expression in his eyes that Yuan Shu felt great pressure from Lu Jie.<br>Lu Jie was like a mountain crushing down on Yuan Shu.<br>Chu Feng wondered if the &lsquo;Lu Jie&rsquo; on the flag was related to the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted&rsquo;s disciple Lu Jie.<br>Did that Lu Jie signify the renowned genius world spiritist of the Holy Light Galaxy, or did it signify something else?<br></p></div>
