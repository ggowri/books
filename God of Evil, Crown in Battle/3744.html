        <div> - Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique Revealing Its Might<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the cold light radiating from the sword that had appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand, and feeling Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura instantly increasing, Linghu Hongfei started to panic slightly.<br>After dodging Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack, he immediately used a martial skill to retreat far away.<br>In the blink of an eye, he had created a distance of several tens of thousands of meters between him and Chu Feng.<br>It was not that Linghu Hongfei was making a fuss over a minor issue.<br>Instead, Linghu Hongfei knew that even though he was able to suppress Chu Feng in their confrontation, he was only slightly superior to him.<br>After Chu Feng took out his Incomplete Exalted Armament, Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s battle power became completely inferior to Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that their disparity is not very large.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, many martial cultivators present also noticed the disparity being smaller than anticipated.<br>There were even people that noticed the panic on Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s face.<br>Although that panic lasted but an instant, it was still captured by them.<br>Because of that, they became certain that the disparity between Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei was not large, and that Chu Feng could turn the battle around using only an Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>That said, Linghu Hongfei would naturally not allow this sort of thing to happen.<br>At the same time as he rapidly retreated from Chu Feng, he also took out his own Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Cold light shone everywhere as sword rays slashed out. Linghu Hongfei had rushed to attack Chu Feng again.<br>&ldquo;Perfect timing.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the incoming Linghu Hongfei, Chu Feng showed no signs of fear. With the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword in hand, he collided with Linghu Hongfei.<br>With the help of their Incomplete Exalted Armaments, Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s battle power once again returned to its earlier state of equilibrium.<br>With that, the previous scene occurred again.<br>At the beginning, the two of them were evenly matched. However, gradually, the battle started to tilt towards Linghu Hongfei. Chu Feng was beginning to lose, and Linghu Hongfei had begun to suppress him.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after Linghu Hongfei began to suppress Chu Feng, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation increased from rank five Exalted to rank six Exalted.<br>Lightning gathered into the character &lsquo;Divine&rsquo; on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead. This revealed to the crowd how Chu Feng had increased his cultivation.<br>Perhaps because he had learned his lesson when Chu Feng took out his Incomplete Exalted Armament previously, Linghu Hongfei was not at all caught off-guard by Chu Feng. In fact, he was waiting for him to increase his cultivation.<br>At practically the same instant as Chu Feng released his Lightning Mark to increase his cultivation, Linghu Hongfei also released his own Lightning Mark.<br>At practically the same time as Chu Feng, Linghu Hongfei increased his cultivation from rank five Exalted to rank six Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, to the crowd&rsquo;s surprise, after Chu Feng released his Lightning Mark, his cultivation actually increased again. At that moment, his cultivation had reached rank seven Exalted.<br>It was due to his Lightning Armor.<br>The crowd were not surprised to see Chu Feng&rsquo;s Lightning Armor.<br>Although the Lightning Armor was a power that was very difficult to unseal, there had been people that had already seen Chu Feng&rsquo;s Lightning Armor, and word of it had already spread.<br>Thus, the crowd already knew that Chu Feng possessed the Lightning Armor.<br>Although they were astonished by his talent after seeing his Lightning Armor, they were not too surprised by it.<br>Furthermore, they did not believe that Chu Feng would be able to change the situation of the battle simply by releasing his Lightning Armor.<br>After all, the crowd all knew that Linghu Hongfei also possessed the Lightning Armor.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, after Chu Feng unleashed his Lightning Armor, Linghu Hongfei also unleashed his own Lightning Armor.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I possess all the abilities that you possess. How exactly are you supposed to contend against me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your outcome has been determined from the very start. No matter how much you struggle, it will all be useless," Linghu Hongfei mocked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;<br>However, facing Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s mockery, the corners of Chu Feng&rsquo;s mouth rose into a strange smile.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, the sword in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand grew extremely fast. It was so fast that Linghu Hongfei found it difficult to block. Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks had become even sharper.<br>In fact, as their weapons collided, Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s palms grew slightly numb. Furthermore, Linghu Hongfei was retreating. Linghu Hongfei was actually finding it difficult to receive Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks.<br>Originally, the crowd had thought that after both Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei increased their cultivations, Chu Feng would once again be suppressed by Linghu Hongfei.<br>However, the current situation made them realize that they were mistaken.<br>The person being suppressed at that moment was no longer Chu Feng. Instead, it was Linghu Hongfei.<br>&ldquo;How could this be? Both Linghu Hongfei and Chu Feng clearly possess the same level of cultivation. Why would their battle power be different now? Could it be&hellip; Chu Feng had deliberately concealed his battle power earlier?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all feeling confused. Like Linghu Hongfei himself, they had thought that he would be able to continue to suppress Chu Feng. However, the current situation of the battle had proved them wrong.<br>It was inevitable for them to ponder why such a transformation would suddenly occur.<br>Chu Feng hiding his battle power from the very start was a good justification.<br>&ldquo;No, perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t that Chu Feng had deliberately concealed his cultivation. It might be due to the difference between their Self-punishment Mysterious Techniques.&rdquo;<br>Someone voiced a different opinion.<br>&ldquo;Self-punishment Mysterious Techniques?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were confused by that person&rsquo;s claim.<br>&ldquo;Although both of them have unlocked their Lightning Marks and Lightning Armor, powers unique to Heavenly Bloodline possessors, you shouldn't forget that &lsquo;Divine&rsquo; character on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead whereas Linghu Hongfei only has the character &lsquo;Heaven,&rdquo; that person said.<br>&ldquo;Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique! So it was actually the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How did I forget that Self-punishment Mysterious Techniques differ in strength?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although the Heaven Punishment Mysterious Technique is the top of the line, there are a lot of younger generations in the Ancestral Martial Starfield that are trained in it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, to be able to train in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique and do so successfully, there is only one person of the younger generation in the Ancestral Martial Starfield -- Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the crowd came to a sudden realization.<br>Earlier, they had all felt that Linghu Hongfei would definitely come out victorious.<br>Because of that, they&rsquo;d all overlooked Chu Feng&rsquo;s advantages. The greatest advantage Chu Feng possessed would be the fact that he was trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>As the most difficult Self-punishment Mysterious Technique, the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique surpassed all other Self-punishment Mysterious Techniques.<br>Furthermore, due to its higher level, the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was capable of causing an innate suppression of the Heaven Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>Thus, the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique would serve to be the greatest explanation as to why Chu Feng was able to suppress LInghu Hongfei.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks grew fiercer and fiercer. The sword in his hand was sending forth blade rays like a torrential rain that engulfed Linghu Hongfei.<br>Compared to when Chu Feng was being suppressed by him, Linghu Hongfei was being suppressed much more evidently, and left in a much more miserable state.<br>Although Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks were extremely fierce, his facial appearance was not fierce at all. He even had a faint smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;Linghu Hongfei, what&rsquo;s wrong? Why are you retreating constantly?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you state that you would suppress me from the start?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your current appearance is truly a disappointment.&rdquo;<br>While suppressing Linghu Hongfei, Chu Feng was insulting him.<br>This greatly angered Linghu Hongfei, who was an egotistical person to begin with. As he possessed many abilities, he was also filled with confidence.<br>Thus, he was unable to tolerate being insulted by another like so!!!<br>&ldquo;Heeeeahhh!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Linghu Hongfei let out a loud shout. Then he brandished the Incomplete Exalted Armament in his hand.<br>In an instant, an enormous blaze was sent forth from his Incomplete Exalted Armament. It rushed towards Chu Feng with the intention to kill.<br>That was an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill. Furthermore, it was extremely powerful.<br>Chu Feng was caught off-guard by Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s sudden attack. Although he managed to block the attack, he was beaten back by it.<br></p></div>
