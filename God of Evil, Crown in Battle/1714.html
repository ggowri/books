        <h1>Chapter 1713</h1>
        <div> - Bound To Become Famous<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Who I am is not important to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s important is that I will publicly humiliate you and make you lose all face.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, his body shifted. He turned into a ray of light and charged toward Jian Xu. At the same time, he extended his palm and grabbed toward Jian Xu&rsquo;s throat.<br>&ldquo;What arrogance!&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s actions, Jian Xu narrowed his eyebrows and revealed an ominous glint in his eyes. He flipped his palm, and a bright and dazzling Incomplete Imperial Armament appeared in his hand. With weapon in hand, he sliced toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s incoming palm to chop off his hand.<br>Even though that Incomplete Imperial Armament was a copy, it still possessed devastating Emperor&rsquo;s might. Furthermore, Jian Xu&rsquo;s attack was also not an ordinary slash; it was a Taboo Martial Skill.<br>A good weapon combined with a martial skill, Jian Xu&rsquo;s attack naturally possessed overwhelming power. Everyone present all began to move backwards repeatedly out of fear of Jian Xu&rsquo;s attack.<br>Even though the people present might not be able to clearly see Jian Xu&rsquo;s attack, they were all able to sense how dangerous, fierce and powerful his attack was.<br>&ldquo;Break for me!&rdquo;<br>Right at the moment when Jian Xu&rsquo;s powerful attack was about to reach Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm, Chu Feng shouted coldly, clenched his open palm into a fist and shot it forward explosively.<br>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; A loud explosion was immediately heard. Then, surging energy ripples began to wreak havoc.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s fist strike seemed to be able to break through everything. Not only had it broken through Jiang Xu&rsquo;s strike, it had also landed onto Jian Xu&rsquo;s chest.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s fist strike not only shattered Jian Xu&rsquo;s internal organs, it also pierced a large hole through Jian Xu&rsquo;s chest and knocked him several meters away, where he was smashed ruthlessly into the wall of the cave.<br>The power behind the strike that sent Jian Xu flying was so strong that he left a large crater and numerous cracks in the wall. Broken rocks began to fall down nonstop.<br>However, even with that being the case, Jian Xu actually stood back up on the ground steadily. Not only was there no expression of pain on his face, he actually revealed a smile.<br>Jian Xu looked to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got some skills. However, injuries of this level are unable to harm me.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, with a thought, boundless world spirit power began to emit from his body. After his world spirit power appeared, not only did his body start to recover, even his Royal World Spiritist cloak that had been shattered started to recover.<br>&ldquo;Amazing, as expected from the Avaricious Immortal&rsquo;s personal disciple. This level of world spirit technique, isn&rsquo;t it simply too powerful?&rdquo;<br>The crowd began to exclaim in astonishment upon seeing this scene. Many of the people present were proficient in world spirit techniques. Thus, they knew that there were many methods to heal one&rsquo;s injuries and rapidly restore one&rsquo;s body.<br>However, one thing was certain. The method that Jian Xu had used was a very high level technique. It was a technique that ordinary Royal-cloak World Spiritists were unable to accomplish.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s fist strike had been extremely destructive. For ordinary people, they would likely not be able to restore their bodies in a short period of time with the world spirit techniques that they had grasped. However, Jian Xu had restored his body in an instant.<br>&ldquo;Are you certain that I am unable to harm you?&rdquo; To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, when Jian Xu restored his body with that powerful restoration ability, Chu Feng actually smiled.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Chu Feng&rsquo;s words left his mouth, Jian Xu&rsquo;s expression suddenly changed. Then, he opened his mouth and vomited a mouthful of blood. His blood sprayed an entire three feet away.<br>Following that, he began to bleed nonstop from his eyes, nose and ears. Even his legs started to violently shudder. Soon, he had lost the ability to continue standing. Like a sandbag, he fell onto his knees, and then onto his stomach.<br>&ldquo;Bastard, what exactly did you do to me?!&rdquo; At this moment, Jian Xu struggled to lift his head and stared at Chu Feng. He did not dare to believe, and did not understand why his body would be in such weak health.<br>&ldquo;If you thought that my fist strike earlier had only injured your body, then you were gravely mistaken.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll only tell you this. If I had wanted to, I would have been able to take away your measly little life with my fist strike earlier.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the hearts of the crowd all shivered.<br>The meaning of Chu Feng&rsquo;s words was extremely clear. As he possessed the strength to take Jian Xu&rsquo;s life, he would naturally be able to cripple him. At this moment, he had only made Jian Xu unable to move. Thus, it seemed that he was already being lenient enough.<br>However, upon thinking about the fact that Jian Xu, a rank three Half Martial Emperor, a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, the Avaricious Immortal&rsquo;s sole disciple, was actually unable to withstand a single fist strike from this man, the crowd found that this was simply too unbelievable.<br>After all, Jian Xu possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. How could his opponent be able to...<br>Suddenly, someone came to a realization and cried out in alarm. &ldquo;A heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. He most definitely possesses a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation?!&rdquo; The expressions of the crowd all changed upon hearing those words. They were all shocked. The gazes with which they looked to Chu Feng were filled with astonishment, fear and disbelief.<br>For ordinary people, they would not even be able to obtain any heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting a single level of cultivation. Those who were able to do so were all geniuses. Those capable of having a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting two levels of cultivation were all super geniuses. As for those capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation, they were all the legendary demon-level characters.<br>A heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation???<br>This was simply too frightening. Was there really someone capable of such a feat? Someone with such a heaven-defying battle power, could they still be considered to be human?<br>However, Chu Feng ignored the gazes of the crowd. At this moment, he directly walked to Mu Juechen, removed the world spirit formation that was binding him and helped him down.<br>&ldquo;Brother, thank you,&rdquo; After Mu Juechen got back on his feet, he spoke his very first sentence.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re family, there&rsquo;s no need for you to be this courteous,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a low voice.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Mu Juechen was startled to hear those words. Family? What did that mean?<br>This meant that even if Chu Feng was not someone from the World Spiritist Alliance, he would be someone from the Nine Powers.<br>However, Mu Juechen had thought himself to be the strongest person among the Nine Powers&rsquo; disciples. Thus, he had really never expected for there to be a fellow disciple this powerful.<br>At this moment, he was feeling extremely complicated. While he was feeling very joyous, there was also an unspeakable grievance.<br>Mu Juechen was the sole disciple of the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly&rsquo;s Assembly Master, the World Spiritist Immortal. He had been in closed-door training for many years...<br>And now, he had come out from obscurity for the very first time. Originally, he had thought to stun the world and attain fame for himself, attain honor for his master. However, to his surprise, he had been beaten up, hung upside down and publicly humiliated.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for Chu Feng saving him, he would have utterly disgraced himself and his master.<br>At this moment, he had finally experienced the words &lsquo;there are heavens beyond heaven and people beyond the person.&rsquo; [1. In the wider world, there are people more talented than you.]<br>Merely&hellip; it was painful for him to realize those words.<br>&ldquo;Victory and defeat is commonplace in battles. While it is fine to mind them, you must not take them to heart.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Remember, as a man, one must be manly, and not think about trivial matters all day,&rdquo; Chu Feng had managed to guess what Mu Juechen was thinking, and thus comforted him.<br>Mu Juechen nodded. Even though he was feeling very sullen, he was still the person chosen by the World Spiritist Immortal. Thus, he possessed a strong mentality. As such, he understood all that Chu Feng had said.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Mu Juechen asked.<br>&ldquo;You will know my name later on. Everyone present will know too,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled lightly. As he spoke, he took a glance at the crowd.<br>Chu Feng knew that it was definitely not just Mu Juechen who wanted to know who he was. He believed that Jian Xu, Meng Xiaoyan and all the rest of the people present wanted to know who he was too.<br>The people present all realized that Chu Feng&rsquo;s words contained hidden implications. With Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength, without a doubt, he was going to contend against the younger generation from the Four Clans.<br>At that time, without asking, everyone would come to know of his distinguished name.<br>In other words, regardless of what the outcome would be, this man before them would definitely become famous.<br></p></div>
