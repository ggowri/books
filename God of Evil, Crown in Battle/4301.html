        <h1>Chapter 4300</h1>
        <div> - Xianhai Renhu<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Tsk, tsk, tsk. As expected of the renowned young master Shaoyu.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You actually possess such a cultivation at such a young age.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, you will not be able to protect that kid today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only him, you will not be able to protect yourself either,&rdquo; said that man from the Demon Morph Clan.<br>Even though he had fallen into Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s hands, he was not panicking in the slightest. Instead, he was extremely pleased with himself.<br>Hearing those words, Xianhai Shaoyu didn&rsquo;t say anything in response. But, killing intent emerged in his eyes.<br>After he confirmed that it was impossible to obtain any information from this person from the Demon Morph Clan, Xianhai Shaoyu decided to eliminate this person.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>But, right when he was about to act, a dark-black colored blade ray flew over from afar.<br>Xianhai Shaoyu immediately moved back to dodge it.<br>That blade ray severed Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s martial power hand and freed that man from the Demon Morph Clan.<br>Xianhai Shaoyu turned his gaze afar.<br>Once he did so, he started frowning. A look of unease even appeared on his face.<br>Three were over three hundred people standing in the starry sky far away.<br>Those were all people from the Demon Morph Clan.<br>Furthermore, they were standing at the direction where the spirit formation gate formed by the black case was.<br>Those people had sealed off the path for Xianhai Shaoyu and Chu Feng to leave this place.<br>But, if that was all, Xianhai Shaoyu wouldn&rsquo;t be feeling so uneasy.<br>Xianhai Shaoyu was not someone afraid of the Demon Morph Clan.<br>But, at this moment, the auras of the two people leading this group of three hundred plus Demon Morph Clansmen were unfathomable.<br>Not even Xianhai Shaoyu possesses any certainty in being able to defeat those two individuals.<br>Even though he was feeling very uneasy, Xianhai Shaoyu did not reveal it. Instead, he remained calm and composed.<br>&ldquo;You all wanted to plunder the powers that&rsquo;s currently fusing with us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Demon Morph Clan, you all have truly grown bolder and bolder. Are you planning to challenge our Immortal Sea Fish Clan?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Shaoyu with a stern voice.<br>&ldquo;Young master Shaoyu, ignoring the fact that you&rsquo;re in this place all on your own, even if your Immortal Sea Fish Clansnemn are here with you, I will not fear either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are no powers in the entire martial cultivation world that our Demon Morph Clan does not dare offend.&rdquo;<br>As the red-haired leader spoke, he unleashed his boundless oppressive might. He was planning to attack Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Damn it&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Shaoyu frowned even deeper upon seeing this situation.<br>The moment that red-haired Demon Morph Clansman unleashed his oppressive might, Xianhai Shaoyu knew that he would not be that man&rsquo;s match.<br>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;<br>But, right at this moment, the white-haired leader extended his hand and stopped the red-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Are you feeling reluctant?&rdquo;<br>The red-haired leader refused to accept that white-haired leader&rsquo;s decision.<br>Not only did he not retrieve his oppressive might, he was even looking at the white-haired leader with anger in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Boom---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the white-haired leader&rsquo;s body started to distort. Then, oppressive might rushed out from his body.<br>Once his oppressive might appeared, he became the focus of this starry sky.<br>Even the red-haired leader&rsquo;s oppressive might was suppressed by him.<br>At this moment, the people from the Demon Morph Clan, including that red-haired leader, had a change in their expression.<br>Evidently, none of them anticipated for the white-haired leader to be this powerful.<br>The red-haired leader was no match against this white-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;Must you force me to attack you?&rdquo;<br>The white-haired leader looked to the red-haired leader. His gaze turned hostile.<br>Seeing this, the red-haired leader removed his oppressive might. He said, &ldquo;Do not forget, you&rsquo;re already one of the Demon Morph Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I know where I&rsquo;m standing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, I am qualified to make my own decision.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All of you can step down,&rdquo; said the white-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;What is the meaning of that? Are you trying to let them get away?&rdquo; asked the red-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;Do not force me to attack you,&rdquo; As the white-haired leader spoke, his oppressive might grew even stronger.<br>The people from the Demon Morph Clan, including the red-haired leader, were all oppressed by that oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well, I will make sure to report this matter to Lord Clan Chief.&rdquo;<br>Although the red-haired leader was feeling very displeased, he was unable to do anything as the white-haired leader was simply too powerful for him to handle. After leaving those threatening words, he turned around and left.<br>Seeing that, the others from the Demon Morph Clan also followed after him.<br>In a blink of an eye, apart from Xianhai Shaoyu and Chu Feng, only the Demon Morph Clan&rsquo;s white-haired leader remained in this starry sky.<br>&ldquo;What kind of performance is this?&rdquo;<br>Alert filled Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s eyes.<br>He doesn&rsquo;t understand why that white-haired leader did that.<br>But, he knew how dangerous the Demon Morph Clan was.<br>&ldquo;Shaoyu, are you unable to distinguish my voice?&rdquo;<br>As the white-haired leader spoke, he did something shocking.<br>The white-haired leader actually removed the mask from his face and pulled down his hood to reveal his true appearance.<br>While he had a head of white hair, his appearance was that of a middle-aged man. While there were some scars on his face, one could still tell that he was extremely handsome in his youth.<br>Seeing this person, Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s expression turned extremely complicated. It was one of shock and joy. Soon, he blurted out, &ldquo;Fourth uncle!&rdquo;<br>This person was named Xianhai Renhu.<br>He was Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s blood uncle, a blood brother to his father.<br>&ldquo;Shaoyu, it&rsquo;s been a long time. Your cultivation has increased again,&rdquo; said Xianhai Renhu with a smile.<br>His smile was very good-natured. It was a smile that only one&rsquo;s close relative would have.<br>But, facing Xianhai Renhu&rsquo;s good-natured smile, Xianhao Shaoyu was unable to become happy,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fourth uncle, have you really joined the Demon Morph Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why are you doing this?&rdquo;<br>Confusion filled Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s voice. At the same time, he was filled with grief and dismay.<br>Xianhai Shaoyu has been looked after with concern and care by the entire Immortal Sea Fish Clan all his life.<br>This Xianhai Renhu was no exception.<br>The relationship Xianhai Shaoyu had with Xianhai Renhu was also extremely good. It even surpassed that of other close relatives.<br>But, Xianhai Renhu left the Immortal Sea Fish Clan when Xianhai Shaoyu was a youth.<br>It has been many years since they&rsquo;ve last seen one another.<br>There has been rumors in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan that Xianhai Renhu had joined the Demon Morph Clan.<br>But, Xianhai Shaoyu had refused to believe those rumors to be true. He was unwilling to believe that Xianhai Renhu had betrayed their Immortal Sea Fish Clan.<br>&ldquo;Shaoyu, everyone have their path.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are some things that I cannot inform you right now. But, you will one day understand your fourth uncle&rsquo;s difficulties.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, you should leave with your friend.&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Renhu moved aside and opened the path to the spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;If you are to let me go, the Demon Morph Clan will definitely not let you off easily.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fourth uncle, you should return home with me,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>But, Xianhai Renhu smiled and shook his head, &ldquo;I cannot return. As for my safety, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is you, on the other hand, that needs to return to the clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do not go out on your own without any protection.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The martial cultivation world is not peaceful right now.&rdquo;<br>After hearing those words from Xianhai Renhu, Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s eyes were surging with emotions.<br>Even though it has been many years since they&rsquo;ve last seen one another, this fourth uncle of his was still filled with concern and care for him.<br>&ldquo;Fourth uncle, can you tell me why the Demon Morph Clan is here?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Shaoyu.<br></p></div>
