        <div> - The Youth Blocking The Path<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, the crowd proceeded into the Void Sacred Tree together.<br>The Void Sacred Tree was enormous. The insides were like a complicated maze. Entering it, one would feel as if one had entered a boundless, ancient forest.<br>However, for other ancient forests, even if the trees reached the skies, they would be composed of countless trees.<br>It was different for the Void Sacred Tree, as it was only a single tree.<br>That said, no matter how enormous the Void Sacred Tree might be, its size was still limited. To martial cultivators, it could not be considered extraordinary.<br>It was only when they actually entered the Void Sacred Tree that they realized the Void Sacred Tree was much more miraculous than they had expected.<br>The further they went, the more spacious the area within the Void Sacred Tree became. Even the sky was completely blocked by it.<br>That said, there were a lot of fireflies inside the Void Sacred Tree. These fireflies were somewhat special. Their lights were extremely bright. The majority of them were on the tree trunk. Thus, the insides of the Void Sacred Tree were brightly lit.<br>That said, this was not what was miraculous about it. What was miraculous was that the insides of the Void Sacred Tree appeared much larger than it appeared when looking in from the outside.<br>It simply did not resemble having entered a giant tree. Instead, it was more like they had entered an isolated world. No one knew exactly how big the world was.<br>As they went further in, they would occasionally encounter green fruits, the so-called Sacred Tree Fruit.<br>In the beginning, the crowd were very excited, and it even seemed like they would fight over them.<br>However, they were reminded by the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief that the interior of the Void Sacred Tree was extremely vast, and could even be said to be boundless. If they were to return through the same path they came from, they would be able to leave. However, if they continued to go deeper, they would not be able to reach the other end at all. There had never been anyone that was able to enter the Void Sacred Tree and exit through the other end.<br>Furthermore, the further in one went, the more numerous the Sacred Tree Fruits became.<br>Furthermore, they would soon enter an extremely vast area. After reaching that place, one could proceed further in all directions. Furthermore, the further in one went, the more Sacred Tree Fruits one would encounter.<br>At that time, everyone would be able to scatter and seek out Sacred Tree Fruits on their own. There was simply no need to fight over them right now.<br>In the beginning, the crowd were skeptical of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s words. However, as they went further in, the number of green fruits truly increased. With this, they had no choice but to believe him.<br>Thus, no one decided to fight over the Sacred Tree Fruits. Instead, the first person who saw the fruit would obtain the fruit. En route, the crowd were rather amiable with one another.<br>Of course, there was also an exception to the case. As for this exception, it was Kong Tianhui.<br>For others, they would allow the person closest to the fruit to pick it up and be theirs. Others would not fight over the fruits.<br>However, it was different for Kong Tianhui. Like a bandit, he would rush to fight over the fruits.<br>Thus, during the journey, there were many people that did not manage to obtain a single Sacred Tree Fruit, whilst Kong Tianhui had plundered over a hundred.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, why aren&rsquo;t you snatching up the fruits? These fruits are quite tasty,&rdquo; Kong Tianhui had snatched another fruit, and was eating them by the mouthful.<br>From the way he was eating the fruit, it did appear that the fruits were rather tasty.<br>Most importantly, that guy had eaten dozens of fruits already.<br>&ldquo;Those who have come are guests. You all can go ahead and pick out the fruits first. Once we go further into the Void Sacred Tree, I will go and seek out fruits for myself,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case. Then I will satisfy my hunger first. These fruits are truly quite tasty.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Beautiful big sister, you should have a try too,&rdquo; Kong Tianhui took out two Sacred Tree Fruits and gave them to Chu Feng and Li Ruochu.<br>Chu Feng and Li Ruochu did not refuse him. They accepted the fruits and bit down on them.<br>The size and shape of the Sacred Tree Fruits were similar to apples. However, they were very juicy, and had a taste resembling a pear. Merely, they were more delicious than pears. Most importantly, after eating the fruit, a dense amount of natural energies would directly enter one&rsquo;s body, which one would be able to easily refine.<br>At the same time, it would also clear one&rsquo;s mind and raise one&rsquo;s awareness.<br>To other martial cultivators, and especially those of the younger generation, these fruits should be quite effective, and be considered to be very good martial cultivation resources.<br>However, to Chu Feng, they were not very effective at all. The reason for that was because he already possessed a vast amount of natural energies within his body.<br>What he lacked was martial comprehension that would allow him to gain an opportunity to make a breakthrough in his cultivation.<br>Although the Sacred Tree Fruits also possessed a bit of martial comprehension, it was simply too little for Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng finally realized why the Chu Heavenly Clan did not occupy the Void Sacred Tree, a sacred martial cultivation ground, for their own, and instead allowed all powers to enter it to train.<br>Whilst it was true that that place contained a very dense amount of natural energies, and the Sacred Tree Fruits were able to assist one on the path of martial cultivation, the assistance the Sacred Tree Fruits provided was very minute.<br>Thus, Chu Feng was no longer interested in the Sacred Tree Fruit. His interest shifted to the golden fruit.<br>That said, what Chu Feng was concerned about the most was still Wang Qiang.<br>&lsquo;With how enormous this place is, where exactly must I go to find him?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;That guy has stayed in this place for so long, could he have run out the instant it opened?&rsquo;<br>Chu Feng was slightly worried that he would not be able to find Wang Qiang. At the same time&hellip; he was worried that he might&rsquo;ve encountered some sort of danger.<br>After all, even the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said that the Sacred Full Bloom was completely unprecedented, and no one knew what would happen during this period.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, beautiful big sister, after we reach that vast area, everyone will likely disperse for the sake of seeking out greater personal benefits.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, let us continue to travel together so that we can look after one another,&rdquo; Kong Tianhui said to Chu Feng and Li Ruochu.<br>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; both Chu Feng and Li Ruochu nodded in agreement.<br>&ldquo;Who is it?!!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, someone suddenly shouted at the front of the crowd.<br>The crowd immediately stopped upon hearing the loud shout. They all turned their eyes ahead.<br>It turned out that ahead of them was the region mentioned by the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the place with multiple routes all over that would allow the crowd to disperse. However, there was a person standing in that vast region.<br>It was a young man. He was facing the crowd and standing in midair.<br>He had a rather particular attire. He was wearing wooden armor composed of tree bark identical to the wood of the Void Sacred Tree.<br>Furthermore, the aura of the Void Sacred Tree was emitting from his body. It was as if&hellip; he was one with the Void Sacred Tree.<br>The crowd all revealed serious expressions upon seeing this person who suddenly appeared, blocking their path with a somewhat ill-intended gaze. No one dared to be careless facing that person.<br>However, when Chu Feng saw that person, an enormous wave rose his heart. He even felt disbelief upon witnessing the scene before him.<br>Even though that youth gave off a superb air and resembled a celestial being, his facial appearance was very familiar to Chu Feng.<br>Was that not Wang Qiang?<br></p></div>
