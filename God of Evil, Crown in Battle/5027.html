        <h1>Chapter 5026</h1>
        <div>: Lush Immortal City<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Elder, you&rsquo;re willing to help me save my master and the others?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked despite not knowing anything about the other party.<br>Just like how the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief looked at him with hopeful eyes earlier, he directed the same gaze toward the mysterious hooded figure before him.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll depend on you. However, I can point a way out for you,&rdquo; the mysterious hooded figure said.<br>Chu Feng felt his heart sinking upon hearing those words. He thought that the other party would directly make a move for him, but she was only pointing a way out for him. Nevertheless, he was thankful to the other party.<br>Considering that he had no clues at the moment, he would be grateful to the other party if she could tell him where his master was imprisoned.<br>&ldquo;Elder, please tell me where my master and the others are imprisoned,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to save them even if I tell you where they are imprisoned,&rdquo; the mysterious hooded figure shook her head and replied.<br>It was then that Chu Feng realized that he had mistaken the meaning of the other party&rsquo;s words. When the mysterious hooded figure said that she could point a way out forhim, she didn&rsquo;t mean that she would tell him where the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and the others were imprisoned.<br>&ldquo;Elder, may I ask what do you mean when you said that you would point a way out for me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;Sima Xiangtu is backed by the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. You should be aware of that, right?&rdquo; the hooded figure asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware of that,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;The Pill Dao Immortal Sect came here as a group. You&rsquo;re still too weak to directly confront Sima Xiangtu or the cultivators of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect at the moment, so you&rsquo;ll have to look for an alternative method. I happen to know the whereabouts of a young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect who came here to frolic around.<br>&ldquo;That young master is the son of the group&rsquo;s leader. If you&rsquo;re able to capture him and use him to threaten Sima Xiangtu, Sima Xiangtu will have no choice but to release your friends,&rdquo; the hooded figure said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, where is the young master you spoke of?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s written here. I&rsquo;ve already pointed out a way for you. Whether you&rsquo;ll be able to succeed or not depends on you.&rdquo;<br>The hooded figure reached into her sleeves and took out a scroll. Chu Feng quickly received the scroll from her and unfurled it.<br>The scroll contained a location and the painting of a man. The man had an ordinary appearance, but he gave off a sinister air. There was a name right beside the painting: Jiang Kongping.<br>Clearly, Jiang Kongping was the young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect that the hooded figure was talking about.<br>&ldquo;Elder, thank&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng rolled up the scroll and thanked the hooded figure, only to find that the latter had disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Elder?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng called out for the hooded figure, but he didn&rsquo;t receive any answers. It appeared that she had already left the area.<br>That left him with even more doubts.<br>The hooded figure seemed to have a deep understanding of Chu Feng, or else she wouldn&rsquo;t have known that Chu Feng was aware of the link between Sima Xiangtu and the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. This meant that she had been observing Chu Feng all this while.<br>Chu Feng had no recollections of meeting this hooded figure before, meaning that the latter was a stranger. It was weird how invested she was into this matter. Stringing the clues together, he eventually made a deduction.<br>Could this hooded figure be the one whom the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief mentioned that could save the Nine Souls Galaxy?<br>There was no way for him to verify his guess at the moment, so he could only go on his way with a mind filled with doubts.<br>He thought that the solution provided by the hooded figure was actually quite decent. If he could capture the young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect named Jiang Kongping, there was a good chance that Sima Xiangtu would obediently release all of the captives.<br>It was fortunate that even though Jiang Kongping was in another realm, it wasn&rsquo;t a long journey away from where he currently was. It didn&rsquo;t take him long to arrive there.<br>He quickly made his way toward a place known as Lush Immortal City.<br>After some investigation, he found that Lush Immortal City was quite a unique place. It used to be an ancient remnant in the Ancient Era, and there was a powerful barrier cast over it that allowed access only to the juniors.<br>The treasures inside the ancient remnant had already been taken away, but it was remodeled into a place for the juniors to fool around at.<br>In other words, even if the Pill Dao Immortal Sect had dispatched experts to protect Jiang Kongping, they could only guard the outside of the city. This made Chu Feng much more confident about capturing Jiang Kongping.<br>It was not too far-fetched to say that Chu Feng was currently the strongest junior of the Eastern Region given his current cultivation. Unless the young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect possessed exceptional skills, he wouldn&rsquo;t pose a problem to Chu Feng at all.<br>Knowing that his friends&rsquo; lives were at stake, he dared not to waste any time and rushed straight ahead. Along the way, he flew by several cities and villages, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but notice loud sobbings.<br>Through overhearing their conversations, he learned that they were in grief because their daughters had been taken away from them. The ones who kidnapped their daughters were from Lush Immortal City, and they did so in broad daylight. They claimed that these women would be serving esteemed guests, and they would return with great riches in the near future.<br>He could practically hear crying in every single village and city he passed by. It made him shudder to think just many more victims there were out there.<br>&ldquo;Could it be the doing of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s young master? Is it yet another beast who exploits the weak?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t stop by to clarify with the victims, but he already had his guesses.<br></p></div>
