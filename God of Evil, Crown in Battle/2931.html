        <div> - The Legend Of The Blood Clan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Senior, what is this indication from the petal?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to ask the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;The Illusory Blood Lotus&rsquo;s treasures will always be open for people to obtain. However, not every single treasure can be obtained by anyone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For some, there are age limits. That sort of restriction will be indicated by the petals.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A single petal will mean a hundred years of age. Right now, a single petal is flickering. This means that only people of the younger generation within a hundred years of age will be able to approach the Illusory Blood Lotus to obtain its treasure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those older than this age limit will explode and die should they step into the fog,&rdquo; the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case. Never would I have imagined the Illusory Blood Lotus to have such a restriction,&rdquo; Chu Feng felt very surprised.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason why I feel that the sudden appearance of the Illusory Blood Lotus at this place after having disappeared for so long is not necessarily a coincidence,&rdquo; the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said as he looked to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that it was deliberately placed here by someone? That Illusory Blood Lotus is being controlled by someone?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;There are many different legends regarding the Illusory Blood Lotus.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The subject of one such legend is that there was once a mysterious and ancient race in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. This race was called the Illusory Blood Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Within the Illusory Blood Clan was an inherited treasure. As for that inherited treasure, it was something that could only be used by the people of the Illusory Blood Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When being used by them, that inherited treasure would become a boundlessly powerful killing mechanism.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That inherited treasure is none other than the Illusory Blood Lotus.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, the Illusory Blood Clan is also only a legend. No one has truly seen them before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I do not think that the Illusory Blood Lotus&rsquo;s appearance in this place is because someone controlled it and made it appear here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rather than being controlled by someone, I am more willing to believe that the Illusory Blood Lotus is something that possesses intelligence,&rdquo; the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you mean to say that the Illusory Blood Lotus appeared here of its own accord?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, what would its purpose be?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Things that possess intelligence will naturally have their own resolve. I feel that it has appeared here today for you all,&rdquo; the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said.<br>&ldquo;For us?&rdquo; Chu Feng was surprised.<br>&ldquo;Whenever the Illusory Blood Lotus blooms, a treasure will appear. Since the treasure will be given to someone, why not give it to a hero, instead of some trash?&rdquo; The Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng felt what the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said to be reasonable.<br>After all, there were quite a lot of members of the younger generation gathered in the Ghost Sect Hall at that moment.<br>Among the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were Chu Lingxi, Chu Ruoshi and Chu Huanyu, three geniuses that were ranked on the Demon-level Geniuses List.<br>For the Starfall Holy Land, both their Holy Son and Holy Daughter were present.<br>Apart from them was the Paradise Valley&rsquo;s Ren Xiaoyao.<br>Moreover, the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Ghosteye Boy was likely also present.<br>The gathering of so many geniuses from the younger generation was likely an extremely rare occurrence, even for the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>If the Illusory Blood Lotus was truly something with intelligence, and could choose people, then it would be understandable for it to have deliberately come here.<br>While Chu Feng and the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master were chatting, that aged old man also started to explain what the indication of the Illusory Blood Flower&rsquo;s petal meant to the crowd.<br>At that moment, everyone came to know that the blooming of the Illusory Blood Lotus this time around would only be open to those of the younger generation.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually only the people of the younger generation within a hundred years of age that are allowed to enter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Immortal Armament is right there. Yet, we&rsquo;re unable to get it.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that only people of the younger generation would be able to enter the crimson fog emitted by the Illusory Blood Lotus, the crowd that was originally extremely eager to enter all revealed disappointed expressions.<br>After all, the great majority of the people there were people that had cultivated for hundreds or even thousands of years.<br>They were all over the age limit. In other words, they did not possess the qualifications to fight for that Immortal Armament. Naturally, they would feel regretful at missing this opportunity.<br>That said, while those from the older generation were feeling regretful, there were a lot of people from the younger generation present too. In fact, there were even those that were daring among them that directly stepped into the crimson fog emitted by the Illusory Blood Lotus.<br>Sure enough, when those people from the younger generation stepped into the fog, they did not explode and die. Instead, they immediately stopped moving after entering the crimson fog. It was as if they were trapped in the crimson fog.<br>They had all closed their eyes. It was as if they had entered a deep slumber.<br>They&hellip; should be caught in the illusion.<br>Seeing this, many of the bystanders started to open their eyes wide.<br>Although they were unable to participate in the fight over the Immortal Armament, it was still an interesting thing for them to personally witness those people of the younger generation contending with one another for the Illusory Blood Lotus&rsquo;s treasure.<br>After all, that Illusory Blood Lotus was something that had not appeared for a hundred years now.<br>&ldquo;Wuuu~~~&rdquo;<br>Not long after those people of the younger generation entered the fog, one of them revealed an expression of pain.<br>Not long afterward, more and more of them started to reveal twisted expressions of pain. In the end, all of the people that had entered the fog revealed painful expressions all across their faces.<br>Their expressions were growing uglier and uglier. It was as if they were enduring some sort of torture. In fact, some among them could not endure the pain, and started to howl miserably in grief.<br>Soon, there were actually people that started to bleed from all of their seven facial orifices. Their bodies were shivering violently.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a member of the younger generation sprayed out a mouthful of blood. He was spraying out so much blood that it seemed like he was vomiting out all of the blood in his body at once. The blood covered his clothes completely.<br>After that, he managed to escape the crimson fog. However, he was diving toward the ground like a loose kite. In the end, he crashed into the ground.<br>After him, all of the other people of the younger generation that had entered the crimson fog started to fall from it as well.<br>At that moment, those that were better off ended up suffering serious injuries and fainting.<br>As for those that ended up more miserably, they had already lost their lives.<br>&ldquo;To enter it without sufficient aptitude is simply courting death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, the treasure from the blossoming of the Illusory Blood Lotus is not something that just anyone can fight over.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If only the geniuses from our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s Demon-level Geniuses List were present. If it were them, they would definitely be able to effortlessly obtain this Illusory Blood Lotus&rsquo;s Immortal Armament.&rdquo;<br>After those people of the younger generation were all defeated, the crowd began to sigh with regret.<br>The surrounding crowd did not feel the slightest bit of sympathy toward their injuries or deaths.<br>They had overestimated their capabilities, and died or been injured because of it.<br>The world of martial cultivators was such a world. No one would pity those that overestimated their capabilities; no one would pity those that were weak.<br>That said, they were feeling very regretful. They were regretful because they were unable to personally witness someone obtaining the Illusory Blood Lotus&rsquo;s treasure.<br>Suddenly, someone said, &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it said that Young Hero Chu Feng came to participate in the Grand Auction Assembly? If Young Hero Chu Feng were willing to give it a try, he would definitely be able to obtain that Immortal Armament.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Didn&rsquo;t Young Hero Chu Feng come here to auction his secret skill? He should still be here, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Quickly, someone go and tell Young Hero Chu Feng to come here.&rdquo;<br>After hearing the name &lsquo;Chu Feng&rsquo;, expectation appeared in the eyes of the many surrounding individuals.<br>&ldquo;Yoh, it would appear that your status in the eyes of the people from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm is quite high right now,&rdquo;<br>Seeing the crowd&rsquo;s expressions and voices of anticipation, Her Lady Queen started to tease Chu Feng mischievously.<br>Although she was teasing Chu Feng, the bright, sweet and beautiful smile on her face verified that she was actually feeling happy that he was able to obtain his current standing from the bottom of her heart.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is not the only genius of the younger generation that has come here!&rdquo; Right at that moment, a voice suddenly exploded from the direction of the Ghost Sect Hall.<br><br><br></p></div>
