        <div> - Retrieving Lost Dignity<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Slight punishment? If it wasn&rsquo;t for the protective power of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, you all would&rsquo;ve died multiple times. Yet, you&rsquo;re calling that a slight punishment?&rdquo;<br>An expression of anger appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes. Suddenly, he grabbed Chu Ping and lifted him up. He then pointed to Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu, &ldquo;Open your eyes and look carefully! The three of them are your brothers!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your brothers have been tortured to such a state by them. Yet, you&rsquo;re saying that it is merely a slight punishment?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you even qualified to be their elder brother?&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng ruthlessly threw Chu Ping to the ground.<br>Sitting powerlessly on the ground, Chu Ping had a stunned expression. He was at a loss as to how to respond.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Ping, when you kneeled on the ground and begged them for forgiveness, had you ever thought that what you&rsquo;ve done was not something that our Old Ancestor wished to see?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What you did not only humiliated yourself, it also humiliated our entire Chu Heavenly Clan, humiliated our ancestors!&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed at Chu Ping and spoke loudly.<br>Chu Ping was quiet. His body was shivering. His eyes grew red as tears began to flow from them unceasingly.<br>&ldquo;&rdquo;Do you know why they looked down on our Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you really think that they would spare you after you kneeled and begged for forgiveness?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will tell you this, they would not.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They did not do so in the past, they will not do so now, and they will not do so in the future. Never will they ever do that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The world of martial cultivators has always been one where the weak are prey to the strong. Even if you are to wag your tail and beg for pity, no one will really sympathize with you,&rdquo; Chu Feng continued.<br>Chu Ping&rsquo;s cheeks were streaming with tears. He was sobbing without making a sound.<br>&ldquo;What use is there in crying? If crying is of use, we wouldn&rsquo;t have to put forth the effort to train anymore.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng stretched out his hand and grabbed Chu Ping&rsquo;s arm, pulling him back up from the ground.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Ping, look carefully. I, Chu Feng, will tell you how to change the opinion that others have of us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The dignity that has been seized by others, only by seizing it back with one&rsquo;s own hands will it be reborn in our hearts. Otherwise, it will forever remain a stain in our hearts.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and boundless power was released from his body.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, all of the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan fell to the ground and let out miserable screams.<br>Their bodies and soul were being destroyed repeatedly.<br>They were experiencing the pain and fear of being killed repeatedly. They were experiencing death repeatedly.<br>That was not only a torture of one&rsquo;s physical body or a destruction of one&rsquo;s soul, it was a torture of one&rsquo;s spirit.<br>&ldquo;All of you, listen carefully. You can either kneel on the ground, kowtow and apologize to my brothers, or continue to be tortured by my power forever.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While it is true that I will not be able to kill you all, as the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s power is protecting your lives, I dare to guarantee that, if I wanted to, I would be able to have you all suffer a nervous breakdown and lose all awareness to become walking corpses.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng threatened the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please stop. I am willing to kowtow and apologize, I am willing to kowtow and apologize. Please spare my life.&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, there was immediately someone from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan that voiced their intention to kowtow and beg for forgiveness.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I am willing to apologize to your brothers. Please spare me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, I am also willing. I am also willing.&rdquo;<br>Following that, more and more people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan voiced their intention to kowtow and beg for forgiveness.<br>Soon, all of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Beasts present voiced their intention to kowtow and apologize to Chu Ping, Chu Qing, Chu Huanyu and Chu Haoyan.<br>Even the one that had looked at Chu Ping and the others with utter contempt and tortured them repeatedly voiced his intention to kowtow and beg for forgiveness.<br>With this, Chu Feng retrieved his power. Then, he coldly said, &ldquo;You all should know what to do. If anyone dares to disobey in any way, I will have you all wish you were dead.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, I was wrong, I was wrong. It was all my fault earlier. Please spare me.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, someone kneeled on the ground and began to kowtow to Chu Ping.<br>Seeing that, Chu Ping was stunned.<br>He had never expected for the first person to kneel and apologize to him to be that arrogant individual who had tortured him earlier.<br>Following that, all of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen present knelt and began to kowtow to Chu Ping and the others repeatedly. Not only were they kowtowing, but they were also begging for forgiveness. In fact, their voices were even trembling.<br>It was fear. They were extremely afraid.<br>At that moment, Chu Ping simply did not dare to believe what he was seeing.<br>One must know that those were people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.<br>Those people that he would have to avoid should he encounter them were actually all kneeling before him. Not only were they kowtowing, but they were also begging for forgiveness, begging to be spared.<br>Chu Ping truly felt as if he were dreaming.<br>However, he knew very well that this was the truth, that it was actually happening.<br>At that moment, Chu Ping turned his eyes to Chu Feng.<br>He discovered that Chu Feng was still completely expressionless.<br>He suddenly realized that Chu Feng might&rsquo;ve already seen too many of these scenes, and grown accustomed to it.<br>Chu Ping also came to realize that what Chu Feng said was quite possibly correct.<br>In a place like this, one could not be craven and cowardly.<br>Wagging one&rsquo;s tail and begging for pity was completely useless. One would not be able to obtain respect through that.<br>Only by having a harder fist would one be able to obtain respect and fear from others.<br></p></div>
