        <div> - Dismember Into Ten Thousand Pieces<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Before the gazes of the crowd, Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation began to fuse with that grand defensive formation.<br>Although the fusion appeared to be very mild and gentle, it was actually a grand battle of spirit formations.<br>&ldquo;Crack~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Snap~~~&rdquo;<br>After being frantically attacked by the spirit formation that Chu Feng had set up, the grand defensive formation that was originally impregnable began to let out cracking sounds.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Soon afterward, a loud explosion rumbled, and that grand defensive formation collapsed.<br>Success. The spirit formation that Chu Feng had set up managed to successfully undo Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s grand defensive formation.<br>&ldquo;He actually succeeded?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That lousy spirit formation actually managed to shatter such a powerful grand defensive formation?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that scene with their very own eyes, many of the world spiritists present revealed expressions of disbelief. The reason for that was because what had happened was truly unimaginable, simply unreasonable.<br>&ldquo;Although I do not know world spirit techniques, I presume that this might be what they mean by prescribing the right medicine for the illness. Although the defensive formation Grandmaster Kai Hong left was very powerful, little friend Chu Feng evidently saw through its weakness. That is why he managed to destroy it with a single try,&rdquo; Grandmaster Prophet said.<br>Hearing what Grandmaster Prophet said, admiration appeared in the gazes with which the crowd looked at Chu Feng. However, their astonishment did not lessen.<br>After all, that grand defensive formation was something that even the Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists present were unable to break.<br>Yet now, it had been destroyed by Chu Feng.<br>In fact, it was not only them who were astonished. Even Chu Feng felt quite astonished. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that he had managed to see through that grand defensive formation immediately after arriving here, he would not have thought that such a powerful spirit formation would be undone by such a simple formation.<br>Of course, although the spirit formation was simple, it had required an enormous amount of spirit power.<br>Fortunately Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong all possessed much more spirit power than ordinary individuals. Else, it would truly be difficult for them undo that grand defensive formation even if they were to join hands.<br>Thinking about it, Chu Feng took a glance at Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong. He truly never expected that Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong would have as enormous an amount of spirit power as himself.<br>&ldquo;It would seem this stutterer and this demonic woman truly cannot be looked down upon,&rdquo; Even Her Lady Queen was unable to contain herself, and started to praise them.<br>&ldquo;Creak, creak, creak~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, noises began to sound from the coffin.<br>At that moment, the expressions of the crowd all grew serious. They all turned their gazes to the coffin.<br>The reason for that was because the coffin was currently opening by itself.<br>Under the gazes of the crowd, the coffin finally opened completely. Then, a figure appeared before the crowd&rsquo;s line of sight.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?&rdquo;<br>After seeing the figure from the coffin, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang, Zhao Hong and everyone else revealed stunned expressions.<br>This was especially true for Chu Feng. At that moment, his heart was wavering.<br>The reason for that was because the figure that had appeared before them was a child. Furthermore, that child was none other than Xiaoshi.<br>It was the boy who had told Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong about how to obtain the cloaks.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually him?&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, someone from among the crowd blurted out in astonishment. Judging from the expressions of the crowd, they evidently also knew of Xiaoshi.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoshi, you are the Gate Opening Key?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked. He knew that it was not a coincidence for Xiaoshi to appear here.<br>Adding on to the assistance Xiaoshi had provided Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong with, as well as the secrets that he knew, it was very obvious that Xiaoshi possessed an inseparable relationship with the remnants. The best explanation would be that Xiaoshi was that so-called Gate Opening Key.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I am the Gate Opening Key that Grandmaster Kai Hong left here. Only I am able to open the entrance gate behind me,&rdquo; Xiaoshi said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, you actually know that child&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; Someone asked curiously upon hearing Chu Feng mentioning Xiaoshi&rsquo;s name.<br>&ldquo;Actually, all of you had the opportunity to know my name. My clones were present at the various entrances of the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, none of you all believed in me. In fact, none of you all were willing to help me. That is why you all missed the opportunity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the three of them, they chose to help me. As such&hellip; only the three of them were able to undo this grand defensive formation,&rdquo; Xiaoshi said to the crowd.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng and the others all came to a sudden realization. Chu Feng finally realized why he was able to see through the grand defensive formation. Evidently&hellip; it was all caused by Xiaoshi.<br>Merely, compared to Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, the rest of the people present had embarrassed expressions on their faces.<br>That was because it was as Xiaoshi had said, they had indeed all met Xiaoshi before. Merely, none of them had bothered to concern themselves with a child like him.<br>Suddenly, Xiaoshi said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, go ahead and do it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Go ahead and do it? Do what?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Kill me. Only by ending my life will I be able to transform into the key to open the entrance. Else, you will not be able to enter it,&rdquo; Xiaoshi said.<br>&ldquo;No, how could I kill you for the sake of a treasure?&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>Although they had merely encountered one another once, although Chu Feng knew that the purpose of Xiaoshi&rsquo;s existence was to open that gate, Xiaoshi was a friend in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes. Chu Feng was unable to do something like killing his friend in exchange for treasures.<br>&ldquo;Go ahead and kill me. The purpose of my existence has always been to open that gate. It is the responsibility that I hold. Today, I am finally able to fulfill my duty.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, the things Grandmaster Kai Hong left behind are useful to you all,&rdquo; Xiaoshi said.<br>&ldquo;Is there no other alternative other than killing you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; Xiaoshi said.<br>&ldquo;Then, I choose to give up,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Hearing those words, Xiaoshi&rsquo;s expression changed. Overflowing emotions appeared in his clear eyes.<br>However, Xiaoshi was not swayed. He insisted on the decision that he had made. Thus, he said to Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, &ldquo;Wang Qiang, Zhao Hong, the two of you do it.&rdquo;<br>Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang glanced at one another. However, neither of them responded to Xiaoshi. Evidently&hellip; the two of them also did not plan to kill Xiaoshi.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a figure suddenly arrived before Xiaoshi with lightning speed.<br>It was the World Spiritist Saintess. Not only did the World Spiritist Saintess arrive before Xiaoshi, her hand had also penetrated Xiaoshi.<br>&ldquo;Stop!!!&rdquo; Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were all greatly alarmed by that scene.<br>However, everything was too late. By the time Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong managed to react, Xiaoshi&rsquo;s body had been destroyed. He had died by the World Spiritist Saintess&rsquo;s hand.<br>The very next moment, a two meter long sword-like key appeared in the World Spiritist Saintess&rsquo;s hand.<br>Evidently, that was the Gate Opening Key that Xiaoshi had turned into.<br>&ldquo;You damned bastard! I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;<br>Seeing Xiaoshi being killed by the World Spiritist Saintess, violent rage emerged in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes instantly causing boundless killing intent to immediately envelop the area.<br>&ldquo;What a joke. You want to kill me? You think that someone like you is capable of doing that?&rdquo; The World Spiritist Saintess smiled with contempt. No matter what, she was a rank seven Martial Ancestor. Thus, she did not place Chu Feng in her eyes at all.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s arms flashed with light. After the two rays of light were shot forth, they turned into two crystal giants that stood before Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Immediately afterward, two more rays of light flew out and turned into two more crystal giants.<br>It was Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong. The two of them had also unleashed their crystal giants.<br>&ldquo;Those are?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that Chu Feng and his friends were able to reach this place by relying on those?&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing the four crystal giants, the expressions of the crowd all changed. After all, the aura emitted by the crystal giants were those of peak Martial Ancestors.<br>&ldquo;You all, you all actually possess those things?!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the World Spiritist Saintess&rsquo;s expression turned pale. Panic filled her face. The reason for that was because she had truly never expected for Chu Feng and the others to possess that sort of thing.<br>Most importantly, those four crystal giants all possessed the ability to easily kill her.<br>&ldquo;Dismember her into ten thousand pieces!&rdquo; Chu Feng said with rage fuming between gritted teeth.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, the four crystal giants flew toward the World Spiritist Saintess with overwhelming destructive power akin to four death gods.<br><br></p></div>
