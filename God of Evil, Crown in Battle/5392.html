        <div><span>: An Incomprehensible Action</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;Lose my nerves? Why would I? Chu Feng, you are the one who should be losing his nerves. Everyone knows that you&rsquo;re here for Life Crystals to treat your world spirit. Bai </span><span>Yunqing has no reason to steal Life Crystals unless it&rsquo;s for your sake,&rdquo; Jie Zhou refuted.</span><br><span>Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion nodded in agreement.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you have evidence?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have evidence, but we know that you&rsquo;re a culprit. You can deny all you want, but it won&rsquo;t change the facts. However, if you admit to it, I&rsquo;ll at least give you a chance,&rdquo; Jie Zhou said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What kind of chance?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;As long as you admit that you put Bai Yunqing up to it, I&rsquo;ll spare the two of you. However, I have one condition&mdash;you have to have a duel with me,&rdquo; Jie Zhou said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why should I fight with you? What do you hope to prove through that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I already know you stole Lord Shuang Yu&rsquo;s spirit power pill and the scroll she obtained from the Ancient Palace. Without those, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly have cleared those formations inside the Hidden Land,&rdquo; Jie Zhou said.</span><br><span>He wanted to refute everything Chu Feng had achieved.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What? Chu Feng only managed to advance so deep into the Hidden Land because he stole Lord Shuang Yu&rsquo;s scroll?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd was stunned.</span><br><span>Chu Feng looked at him with a disdainful smile as he asked, &ldquo;Do you have evidence?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I don&rsquo;t have any evidence of your misdeeds, which is why I didn&rsquo;t pursue this matter. However, it&rsquo;s a fact that I lost my scroll and pill after inviting you to my place,&rdquo; Lord Shuang Yu interjected.</span><br><span>She was reinforcing Jie Zhou&rsquo;s claims with her authority.</span><br><span>At the same time, she threatened Chu Feng with her voice transmission, &ldquo;You better cooperate with us, or else both you and Bai Yunqing will die today. Surely you don&rsquo;t want Bai Yunqing to die because of you? Don&rsquo;t make me look down on you!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng completely ignored Lord Shuang Yu&rsquo;s threat and continued asking, &ldquo;Lord Shuang Yu, you have been looking down on me ever since I arrived here. Even at our first encounter, you had Bai Yunqing and I enter the more dangerous entrance for the psyche trial. Isn&rsquo;t it ironic how you&rsquo;re trying to act like a kind elder who showed goodwill to me but ended up getting robbed?</span><br><span>&ldquo;And speaking of which, when did you even obtain that scroll from the Ancient Palace? Does anyone else know about it? You should have presented it to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion right away! This is a precious clue to uncovering the Ancient Palace&rsquo;s secret! Or could it be that you&rsquo;re thinking of monopolizing the secret for yourself?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion looked at one another.</span><br><span>They had already heard about the unfair treatment Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing received at the psyche trial. Furthermore, they also wondered if Lord Shuang Yu truly had such a scroll, for they had never heard about it before.</span><br><span>Lord Shuang Yu&rsquo;s face turned cold. She didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng would turn around and question her. He was intentionally making things difficult for her!</span><br><span>It looks like Chu Feng isn&rsquo;t planning to become Jie Zhou&rsquo;s stepping stone at all.</span><br><span>Killing intent flashed across Lord Shuang Yu&rsquo;s eyes. Even if she couldn&rsquo;t deal with Chu Feng right now, she could at least start with Bai Yunqing. She would make Chu Feng pay the price for his insolence.</span><br><span>But before she could say anything, Chu Feng suddenly turned to Jie Zhou and asked, &ldquo;Do you mean what you said? Will you spare the two of us as long as I admit to everything?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ll spare you if you admit to your crimes, but you&rsquo;ll have to duel with me. I&rsquo;ll prove that you couldn&rsquo;t have cleared the Hidden Land without relying on thievery. There&rsquo;s no way our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion could have lost to an outsider!&rdquo; Jie Zhou said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng shook his head in contempt before replying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re prattling away. You must have forgotten how you refused to listen to my advice and dragged your brethren to their deaths after a long monologue about honor and whatnot. Don&rsquo;t forget that I was the one who saved all of you&hellip; and that includes you, Jie Zhou. I am the reason you are still well and alive right now. I am the one who gave you a second chance at life. But instead of knowing gratitude, you turned around and plotted against me and my brother. Disgusting. &rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Zhou&rsquo;s face reddened in anger. He hadn&rsquo;t expected Chu Feng to mention these in public. To make things worse, he couldn&rsquo;t refute them because they were true. He was starting to become unsure of where this was leading to. Chu Feng was not following the script he had in mind at all.</span><br><span>He had planned for Chu Feng to admit to the crimes, thus turning public sentiment against him. While everyone was fuming at Chu Feng, he would step in and defeat Chu Feng to prove he was superior. Through that, his reputation would soar to a greater height.</span><br><span>That was the only way he could vent his anger.</span><br><span>But somehow, he was starting to look like an ungrateful jerk here. Realizing that the situation was quickly turning against him, he turned to Lord Shuang Yu for help.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, regardless of whether you admit to it or not, it&rsquo;s a fact that Bai Yunqing stole my Life Crystal. I have irrefutable evidence of that,&rdquo; Lord Shuang Yu spat. She turned to Bai Yunqing and said, &ldquo;Bai Yunqing, you could have survived this, but you were unlucky to have followed the wrong person. You should have never stolen the Life Crystal for him. Since he refuses to admit it, you have no choice but to take full responsibility for this.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Lord Shuang Yu manifested a saber in her hand. She was truly planning on executing Bai Yunqing.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Wait a moment. All you want me to do is to become Jie Zhou&rsquo;s stepping stone, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng stepped onto the square before turning to Jie Zhou. &ldquo;Come, Jie Zhou. I&rsquo;ll have </span><span>a duel with you. However, I should first let you know that I won&rsquo;t be going easy on you.&rdquo;</span><br><span>This was what Jie Zhou had planned too, but he had started to lose his confidence after seeing how rebellious Chu Feng was. He had no idea what the latter was up to and that scared him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you afraid? Why bother challenging me if you are afraid to lose?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Afraid? There&rsquo;s no way I would be afraid of a shameless knave like you!&rdquo; Jie Zhou soon mustered his courage and stepped onto the square too.</span><br><span>Meanwhile, Ling Sheng&rsquo;er frowned in confusion as she watched the situation develop in an incomprehensible manner. &ldquo;Chu Feng, what in the world are you thinking?&rdquo;</span><br><span>While she had to admit that it was exhilarating to see Chu Feng speak up against Jie Zhou and Shuang Yu, she knew that the consequences were horrendous. At this point, even if Chu Feng admitted to everything, it was unlikely Bai Yunqing would be able to escape the fate of death.</span><br><span>In the first place, it didn&rsquo;t really matter whether the people of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion knew that Chu Feng had been framed or not. The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion wouldn&rsquo;t side with an outsider over their own people. This was how pragmatic the world of cultivation was.</span><br><span>At this rate, Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing would die in vain.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>A powerful spirit power suddenly shot forth. Chu Feng had taken the initiative to attack Jie Zhou. The latter quickly retaliated accordingly. Their fight began just like that.</span><br><span>Boom boom boom!</span><br><span>Rumbles roared from the sky above, as dark clouds began to shroud the clear sky. The crowd clenched their fists in excitement, curious to know what kind of phenomenon would appear here.</span><br><span>One was the prophesied child, whereas the other was a talented prodigy who nearly cleared the Hidden Land. The crowd was curious to know what kind of phenomenon would arise from the battle of these two top-notch talents.</span><br></p></div>
