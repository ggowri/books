        <div> - A Long Path With A Heavy Responsibility<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Xianhai Shaoyu had clearly declared in the past that there would not be anyone that could match his younger sister.<br>Yet now, he told Chu Feng to marry his younger sister?<br>To Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er and Xianhai Gusu, the degree at which Xianhai Shaoyu acknowledged Chu Feng was no longer shocking. Instead, it was terrifying.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, please don&rsquo;t mention this joke again.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled and shook his head at Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I am serious. This is not a joke.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I think that you&rsquo;re capable of matching my sister. Besides, my little sister had already fallen for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sooner or later, the two of you will be together.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unless&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like my sister?&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Shaoyu suddenly narrowed his eyes.<br>Once he said those words, Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er and Xianhai Gusu also looked to Chu Feng.<br>Not like Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er?<br>How could such a man possibly exist in this world?<br>After all, even if one was to ignore her talent and status, merely her appearance was already something that no man could resist.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, you and I are brothers. I see Little Fishy just like how you see her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, like you, also consider her as a younger sister,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er and Xianhai Gusu simply do not dare to believe their ears after hearing those words.<br>Chu Feng actually said he doesn&rsquo;t possess any attraction for Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er?<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, that silly little sister of mine is somewhat pitiful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So it was only an unrequited love.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, I can also understand where brother Chu Feng is coming from. In your impression, my little sister was still only a child. It is very normal for one to not possess any feelings for a child. That I can understand.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, my little sister is actually no longer the same as how she was in your memories.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, you shouldn&rsquo;t make a final conclusion just yet. It wouldn&rsquo;t be too late for you to determine if you like her after meeting her again in the future,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>Not only was he not at all angry at Chu Feng&rsquo;s attitude, he was instead very understanding.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know how to respond to him and ended up smiling helplessly.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, regardless of what your attitude toward my little sister might be, I, Xianhai Shaoyu, will forever be your brother.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Take this title plate. If you happen to come across our Immortal Sea Galaxy in the future, make sure to pay a visit to our Immortal Sea Fish Clan.&rdquo;<br>As Xianhai Shaoyu spoke, he took out a title plate and handed it to Chu Feng.<br>From a single glance, one could tell that title plate was an extraordinary item.<br>It was constructed of very precious materials. A special spirit formation was contained in that title plate. With that spirit formation, no one will be able to forge a fake title plate.<br>The title plate possesses two sides. The front inscribed the characters &lsquo;Immortal Sea Fish Clan.&rsquo;<br>On the back inscribed the words &lsquo;Friend of Xianhai Shaoyu.&rsquo;<br>Without needing any explanation, Chu Feng knew what use and authority this title plate possessed.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, that title plate was something that our clan&rsquo;s clan chief personally ordered to be made for His Highness Shaoyu.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With that title plate in hand, one will not only be able to enjoy the treatment of a distinguished guest upon entering our Immortal Sea Fish Clan, one will also be able to dispatch our clan&rsquo;s bodyguards.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even our clan&rsquo;s elders will salute and give their respect to the holder of that title plate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ten such title plates were made. But, His Highness Shaoyu had only given a single one so far. That is the one that you&rsquo;re holding in your hand,&rdquo; said Xianhai Gusu.<br>The only title plate?!<br>Even though Chu Feng already knew the weight this title plate carried, he realized that he had still underestimated its weight and authority after hearing Xianhai Gusu&rsquo;s explanation.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, this gift is a bit too much, no?&rdquo;<br>With the title plate in hand, Chu Feng felt that the weight of the title plate was simply too much for him to bear.<br>It was not a matter of what the title plate itself was. Rather, it was the fact that Xianhai Shaoyu gave such a precious title plate to him.<br>The weight of this friendship moved Chu Feng more than the authority of the title plate itself.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you need not say that sort of thing. As brothers, there&rsquo;s no need for us to speak like that.&rdquo;<br>After Xianhai Shaoyu said those words, he clasped his fist at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, let us meet again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, let us meet again,&rdquo; Chu Feng returned a clasped fist.<br>Then, he bid his farewell to Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er and Xianhai Gusu too.<br>After that, Chu Feng watched as Xianhai Shaoyu opened a spirit formation gate before him with a treasure.<br>The other side of the spirit formation gate was the boundless starry sky.<br>Xianhai Gusu, Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er and Xianhai Shaoyu all entered the spirit formation gate to the starry sky. With that, the spirit formation gate closed.<br>Chu Feng doesn&rsquo;t know how they were able to cross over the endless starry sky and countless worlds to return to the Immortal Sea Galaxy.<br>But, whatever method they might be using, it was most definitely going to be extraordinary.<br>After Xianhai Shaoyu and others left, Chu Feng felt very complicated.<br>He felt like a poor and low-class bumpkin that had suddenly befriended the young master of a wealthy family.<br>Furthermore, the two of them had determined an identical target!<br>While Xianhai Shaoyu was considering him as a brother, Chu Feng must recognize the disparity between them.<br>He knew that he would have to catch up to Xianhai Shaoyu and decrease the gap between them.<br>Else, how was he supposed to take on that inestimably powerful Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?<br>How was he supposed to rescue his mother?<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you have a long path with a heavy responsibility ahead of you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>At this moment, he was feeling pressure. But, this pressure made him excited.<br>This enormous pressure will inevitably become the motivational power to push him forward.<br>Besides, there was something worthy of rejoicing for him.<br>It was the harvest he obtained from helping Xianhai Shaoyu withstand that black case&rsquo;s power.<br>The power that was capable of strengthening one&rsquo;s bloodline had thoroughly entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. It was currently fusing with Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline.<br>Chu Feng could even faintly feel that he would be able to reach a breakthrough.<br>Perhaps once the power fuses completely, it will not only strengthen his bloodline, it will also provide Chu Feng the opportunity to increase his cultivation by a level.<br>While a single level of cultivation cannot amount to much, it will at least bring him a step closer toward the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>That was something that Chu Feng yearned for the most right now.<br></p></div>
