        <div> - First Slash, Heavenly Lightning Appearance<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd had duplicated Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation, all of his abilities and even his weapons, it had an identical battle power to him.<br>In this sort of situation, Chu Feng&rsquo;s Five Elements Secret Skill was capable of unleashing it's power, granting him an undying and indestructible body.<br>Thus, even an ability as powerful as the Immortal Taboo: Blood Lightning Technique was unable to kill Chu Feng.<br>This was the powerful effect of the Five Elements Secret Skill.<br>Although Chu Feng might not be unparalleled among those of the same cultivation and battle power, no one could kill him.<br>The reason for that was purely due to the fact that he had the Five Elements Secret Skills.<br>His opponent would only be able to kill him should he possess the battle power of a cultivation higher than his.<br>Otherwise, the Five Elements Secret Skills would give Chu Feng an undying and indestructible body.<br>&ldquo;Did you decide to deliberately insult me because you possess that ability that can protect your life?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, you are gravely mistaken.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd stopped its attacks on Chu Feng. He sat down cross-legged and began to observe him.<br>Chu Feng knew why the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd was so confident.<br>After all, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had already informed him that he only had an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time.<br>If Chu Feng could not defeat the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd within an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time, the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd would no longer remain as Chu Feng&rsquo;s shadow. Instead, it would regain its own power.<br>At that time, Chu Feng would not be able to contend against it.<br>The battle would be firmly in the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd&rsquo;s grasp.<br>&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t experienced it myself just now, I would truly have had no idea how powerful my Immortal Taboo: Blood Lightning Technique is. So it&rsquo;s actually that powerful. Being struck by that lightning is somewhat painful.&rdquo;<br>Even though Chu Feng knew that an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time was about to arrive, he was not at all flustered. Instead, a faint smile rose from the corners of his mouth.<br>Seeing the smile on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face, the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd let out a cold laugh.<br>His cold laughter was filled with mockery.<br>Chu Feng knew why the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd was sneering at him. He was ridiculing his ignorance.<br>After all, an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time was soon to arrive. Thus, the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd felt that Chu Feng would soon die.<br>It was precisely because Chu Feng understood all of this that he did not panic. Instead, he said to the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd, &ldquo;Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd, have you ever heard of this phrase?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You know that I&rsquo;m the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd?&rdquo; The Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd was slightly surprised. However, he soon realized something. He asked, &ldquo;It must be that ox-nosed old man who told you that, right?&rdquo;<br>Not only did the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd know of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, but it also managed to guess that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist might&rsquo;ve told Chu Feng about it.<br>&ldquo;Since he has already told you, you should know that once an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time passes, it will be the time of your death,&rdquo; the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd said.<br>&ldquo;I know. Once an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time passes, you will regain your own power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, I will likely be unable to contend against you," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Because of that, you&rsquo;ve given up?&rdquo; asked the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.<br>&ldquo;No, I actually want to thank you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Thank me?&rdquo;<br>The Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd&rsquo;s expression changed slightly upon hearing those words. A confused look appeared in it's eyes.<br>He did not understand why Chu Feng would say that.<br>&ldquo;I naturally need to thank you. If it wasn&rsquo;t for you, I would not have been forced into a corner. If I wasn&rsquo;t forced into a corner, I wouldn&rsquo;t have managed to grasp this ability so quickly.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he once again held the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword with both hands and raised it up high.<br>There was still a faint smile on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face. However, he had an extremely determined look in his eyes. In fact, lightning was flickering in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Soon, the lightning filled his entire body, and even covered the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword he held in his hand.<br>&ldquo;What sort of move is that?&rdquo;<br>The Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd let out a shocked voice upon seeing Chu Feng covered in lightning.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve copied all of my abilities, how could you not know what this is?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Bastard, you&rsquo;ve kept a hidden trump card?&rdquo; asked the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.<br>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not it. I&rsquo;ve just grasped this ability.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Speaking of it, I must thank you. If you didn&rsquo;t force me into desperate straits, I might not have been able to comprehend this ability so quickly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is a move that I&rsquo;ve looked forward to for a very long time. Now&hellip; I will test its might on you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see exactly how powerful this move is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, the sword in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand slashed down. A ray of lightning took the shape of a crescent and swept towards the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.<br>&ldquo;This aura?!&rdquo;<br>Seeing the lightning slash that was sent forth, the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd panicked. He immediately shifted his body aside and wind grew under his feet. He had unleashed a movement ability, and was moving to dodge the incoming attack.<br>As the distance between Chu Feng and the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd was rather far, even though the speed of the lightning slash was very fast, the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd escaped from the range of the attack with his quick reaction.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, when the lightning slash was about to reach the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd, a transformation occurred.<br>From the original crescent shaped slash that only had an attack radius of over a dozen meters, it turned into lightning that filled the entire sea above.<br>Like a massive wave, the lightning filled everything above, and covered an area of several million meters. The Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd was unable to avoid it.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Lightning surged. No seawater could still be seen by the naked eye. Only lightning was present everywhere.<br>After the lightning dissipated, the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd still had the form of a shadowy figure.<br>Merely, at that moment, he was not only lying on the ground, but his body was also completely tattered. Even his aura was extremely weak. He seemed like a dying man.<br>Using an extremely weak voice, the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd asked Chu Feng, &ldquo;That is no ordinary technique. Exactly what is it that you used just then?&rdquo;<br>Having experienced the might of the attack, he grew even more curious about it.<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>However, after the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd said those words, Chu Feng half-knelt onto the ground.<br>Even though the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd was extremely weak at that moment, Chu Feng was also extremely weak.<br>That said, although he was extremely weak, Chu Feng had a look of unconcealable excitement on his face.<br>Chu Feng raised his head and said to the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd, &ldquo;By pure chance, I had obtained a technique.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This technique is extremely difficult to learn. Even though I&rsquo;ve studied it meticulously for a long time, I still did not manage to grasp it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the attack I used earlier, it is the first attack of that technique.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is called, First Slash, Heavenly Lightning Appearance!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;First Slash, Heavenly Lightning Appearance?!!&rdquo;<br>The Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd&rsquo;s gaze grew stern. Evidently, he had firmly remembered that name.<br>&ldquo;That move is truly extraordinary.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, although that move is very powerful, it seems like you&rsquo;ve paid considerably to use it,&rdquo; said the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, I have to pay a price. However, it is worth the price to defeat you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Defeat me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph. Brat, don&rsquo;t be so careless just yet. I am still alive.&rdquo;<br>As the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd spoke, he stood back up.<br>Even though the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd was already badly wounded and near-death, a strange scene began to appear as he stood back up.<br>His aura was actually recovering.<br></p></div>
