        <div> - The Reason For The False Accusation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Seeing the Old Village Chief Ma enter the world spirit entrance, Chu Feng had originally thought about entering it too to follow him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you really plan to enter?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You really trust that old fart that much? Do you not fear that he will kill you to silence you after you have entered?&rdquo; Right at this moment, Eggy&rsquo;s sweet-sounding voice suddenly sounded by Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears. Her tone was one of cautiousness and worry.<br>&ldquo;If he wanted to kill me, he would&rsquo;ve killed me already. In this Sealing Ancient Village, it is simply impossible for us to escape from his grasp.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eggy, I know that you are worried about my safety. However, as matters stand, the only choice I have is to trust him. Other than that, there is no alternative,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Eggy.<br>&ldquo;What you say is reasonable too. Since it&rsquo;s like this, you make the decision then,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;Milady Queen, please rest assured. For you, I will definitely consider things carefully,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile. He actually enjoyed Eggy worrying about him.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. For me, you must consider things carefully,&rdquo; Hearing what Chu Feng said, Eggy smiled. Not only was her voice very pleasant to hear, it was also very soft and gentle, something which was very rare from Eggy. Especially her pair of charming eyes; even though they were narrowed from her smiling, they were very enchanting.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart began to flutter. As Eggy was within him, he was able to see Eggy&rsquo;s appearance in his mind at any time. Seeing Eggy&rsquo;s enchanting smile, Chu Feng started to blush somewhat. He didn&rsquo;t know how he should respond.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, come on in,&rdquo; Right at this time, the voice of the Old Village Chief Ma sounded from that world spirit entrance.<br>Hearing that, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body moved, and he flew through that world spirit entrance.<br>After passing through the world spirit entrance, Chu Feng arrived within an isolated space. This space was not very large, and appeared like an exquisite palace hall. Merely, this palace hall was no ordinary palace hall at all. In fact, it was extremely special.<br>This place was actually a spirit formation. The entire palace hall itself was an extraordinary spirit formation.<br>Gathered around the surroundings of this formation was a lot of Sealing Glacial Water. From a rough estimation, Chu Feng suspected that there were at least a hundred and twenty thousand drops of Sealing Glacial Water here. The rich aura of the Sealing Glacial Water completely covered the palace hall, giving a sensation of relaxation to one&rsquo;s mind.<br>Other than these, Chu Feng also managed to sense an aura that was superior to the Sealing Glacial Water. That aura was very similar to that of the Sealing Glacial Water. However, it was many times stronger than the aura given from the Sealing Glacial Water.<br>Chu Feng suspected that the aura was most likely from the Sealing Glacier. Thus, Chu Feng felt that there should have been a Sealing Glacier in this place.<br>Unfortunately, no matter how Chu Feng looked for it, he was unable to find any trace of the Sealing Glacier.<br>Although Chu Feng did not discover the Sealing Glacier, Chu Feng found the source of that aura. It was being emitted from the center of the formation. Merely, there was absolutely nothing in the center of the formation.<br>As he saw the empty space, Chu Feng turned to Old Village Chief Ma and asked, &ldquo;Could it be that that place is the location where the Sealing Glacier was stored?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It is as you said, that place is the place where the Sealing Glacier was stored. This formation here was set up by our Sealing Ancient Village&rsquo;s ancestor. As for the Sealing Glacial Water here, it is formed from the Sealing Glacier through the use of this formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, this place is no longer generating Sealing Glacial Water. That&rsquo;s because this formation has already stopped.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the reason why this formation has stopped, it&rsquo;s because the core of this formation, the Sealing Glacier, is no longer here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, little friend Chu Feng, it is not that this old man is going back on his word and refusing to give you the Sealing Glacier. Instead, it is that our Sealing Ancient Village no longer possesses a Sealing Glacier anymore,&rdquo; Old Village Chief Ma said helplessly.<br>&ldquo;What? The Sealing Glacier is gone? In that case, where did it go?&rdquo; After finding out that the Sealing Glacier that he wanted was gone, Chu Feng immediately grew anxious.<br>&ldquo;Lost, someone has stolen it,&rdquo; Old Village Chief Ma said. When he said those words, he had an extremely helpless expression on his face. Yet, he was also very calm. It could be seen that the Sealing Glacier had not just been lost. Else, it would have been impossible for Old Village Chief Ma to be this calm.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what is going on here?&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly asked. He had no choice but to ask. To him, the Sealing Glacier was extremely important.<br>&ldquo;This is the secret of our Sealing Ancient Village. While I can tell little friend Chu Feng about it, I hope that you will help me keep this secret,&rdquo; Old Village Chief Ma said.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I, Chu Feng, will definitely keep my lips tight. Without your permission, I will not mention this matter to anyone,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Mn, this old man believes in little friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s moral character. Else, I would not have brought you here. Actually, the reason why I&rsquo;ve brought you here is because I wish to explain everything to you,&rdquo; Old Village Chief Ma appeared to be sorrowful.<br>Then, he said, &ldquo;It's true, the Sealing Glacier has been stolen. However, I do not know who it is who stole it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At the time when it was lost, I did not notice anything. Even the protective formation that was set up around it was completely undamaged.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for me coming here to gather Sealing Glacial Water, I would simply never have discovered that the Sealing Glacier had been stolen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fortunately, the ancestor of our Sealing Ancient Village set up this formation flawlessly. It was even capable of gathering the auras of all the people who had entered this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Most importantly, as long as it gathered enough aura, it would be capable of activating a tracking formation to determine the location of that person, tracking him or her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When I discovered what had happened, I went into closed-door training the entire time and used all of my strength to activate the formation. Finally, I managed to gather a trace of the aura of the person who stole the Sealing Glacier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although it was only a trace, as long as I am given time, I will, sooner or later, be able to gather even more of his or her aura. As long as I am able to gather a sufficient amount, I will be able to activate the tracking formation and find out where the person who has stolen our Sealing Glacier is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, I am also required to pay a certain price in order to accomplish this. I must enter closed-door training in order to do it. For the purpose of tracking down and recovering the Sealing Glacier as quickly as possible, I must enter closed-door training as soon as possible.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is also the main reason why I am passing on the position of village chief to Zhou Sitian.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, the Sealing Glacier is fundamental to the survival of our Sealing Ancient Village. If we do not recover the Sealing Glacier, not only will our Sealing Ancient Village deteriorate from this point onward, it would not be impossible for us to one day perish from this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is the reason why I went against my conscience and wrongly accused little friend Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is also why I am going against my promise and not handing the Sealing Glacier to little friend Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, little friend Chu Feng, please rest assured. At the time when I recover our Sealing Glacier, I will definitely return you your innocence. Even if my reputation is to be swept away, I will still make sure that everyone knows that you&rsquo;re innocent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, at that time, I will present to you double the amount of Sealing Glacier that you&rsquo;ve won,&rdquo; Old Village Chief Ma was extremely apologetic and sincere as he pledged those words to Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
