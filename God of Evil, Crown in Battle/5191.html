        <h1>Chapter 5190</h1>
        <div>: Totem&rsquo;s Nine Daoists<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Demon Spirit King was an existence feared by many, but when the crowd thought about how he was here for the gaseous flame too and would break the barrier hindering them, their eyes slowly grew heated.<br>That changed their fearful gazes into hopeful ones.<br>They were counting on him to break the barrier so that they could get to the bottom of the gaseous flame.<br>Surprisingly, the Demon Spirit King didn&rsquo;t attempt to destroy the barrier at all. Instead, he stopped in front of the barrier and called out, &ldquo;Daoist Ninth Dragon, open the barrier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Daoist Ninth Dragon? Is the one who constructed the barrier Daoist Ninth Dragon?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Someone of Daoist Ninth Dragon&rsquo;s caliber is actually here?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was startled to hear the name &lsquo;Daoist Ninth Dragon&rsquo; here.<br>&ldquo;Who is Daoist Ninth Dragon?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Tao Wu.<br>&ldquo;I am an outsider; I don&rsquo;t know the local cultivators well. However, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Regardless of what his name is, he won&rsquo;t be able to stop this old man,&rdquo; Tao Wu replied arrogantly.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Ninth Dragon is not someone you can make light of. Let me put it this way. It&rsquo;s one thing if Daoist Ninth Dragon came here on his own, but if his other seniors accompanied him here, there&rsquo;s not a chance in hell that we&rsquo;ll be getting anything good out of this,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>&ldquo;Old Cat, what&rsquo;s Daoist Ninth Dragon&rsquo;s background?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Ninth Dragon was an orphan who became sworn brothers with eight other people. They stumbled upon a fortuitous encounter at a monastery and began their cultivation. They spent thirty thousand years in training inside the monastery, but by the end of their closed-door training, they have already become powerful world spiritists that others look up to. It didn&rsquo;t take long for them to become known throughout the world of cultivation as Totem&rsquo;s Nine Daoists.<br>&ldquo;The Exalted Dragon God-cloak Daoist Ninth Dragon is only weakest one of their nine brothers, so you can imagine just how strong the others are. It&rsquo;s rumored that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has tried to recruit them, only to be rejected,&rdquo; Old Cat explained.<br>Old Cat then switched to voice transmission at this juncture before grimly continuing on, &ldquo;Chu Feng, Daoist Ninth Dragon is definitely not someone you can trifle with. Practically no one in the present Totem Galaxy dares to mess with any of their brothers. Even the Totem Dragon Clan also shows them due respect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It seems like he&rsquo;s quite a formidable figure.&rdquo;<br>That made Chu Feng even more curious about the demon coffin. Just what in the world could have prompted a person of high stature to camp in the humble Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm?<br>&ldquo;How strong is the most powerful person of Totem&rsquo;s Nine Daoists?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I heard that only Daoist Ninth Dragon and Daoist Eighth Dragon are still God-cloak World Spiritists. The others are all True Dragon World Spiritists. In particular, Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon stand at the very peak of the Totem Galaxy.<br>&ldquo;No, it would be more accurate to say that they are at the top of the world of cultivation. With Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon&rsquo;s strength, even those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion would have to take a respectful attitude to them,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>&ldquo;Are you sure? Isn&rsquo;t the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion one of the strongest powers in the world of cultivation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in skepticism.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re only saying that because you don&rsquo;t know how the distribution of power in the current world of cultivation is like. Other than the two insignificant galaxies in the Eastern Region, the remaining galaxies are actually of a similar level.<br>&ldquo;Given that Daoist First Dragon and Daoist Second Dragon are the top experts of the Totem Galaxy, they&rsquo;ll be amongst the top even in the Seven Realms Galaxy too. Ordinary cultivators wouldn&rsquo;t dare to slight them,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had heard that the Seven Realms Galaxy was stronger than the Totem Galaxy, but he didn&rsquo;t know that the gap wasn&rsquo;t that big. It would appear that he had been underestimating the Totem Galaxy.<br>He did frown a little when Old Cat said that the two galaxies in the Eastern Region were insignificant. It was no wonder why others held onto the opinion that the Eastern Region was a remote region filled with countryside bumpkins.<br>It looked like their scorn wasn&rsquo;t unfounded.<br>Perhaps, they might not even see the Eastern Region as a part of the world of cultivation due to how weak it was.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Ninth Dragon, are you going to open up or not?&rdquo; a thunderous voice boomed.<br>The Demon Spirit King was calling out again because he didn&rsquo;t receive an answer earlier.<br>Weng!<br>A vortex appeared in front of the barrier, forming a massive spirit formation gate.<br>Upon seeing that, the Demon Spirit King commanded the war chariot to enter the spirit formation gate.<br>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!<br>Several more cultivators also made their moves, hoping to enter the spirit formation gate together with the Demon Spirit King. Nearly ten thousand cultivators bolted toward the spirit formation gate at the same time.<br>The Demon Spirit King jolted his body in response, and a black aura gushed into the air. It morphed into a terrifying tempest that swiftly devoured the ten thousand cultivators. Blood splattered everywhere as the cultivators were sliced into shreds.<br>Everything happened so fast that none of them got a chance to even cry out.<br>The other cultivators who were in the midst of approaching the spirit formation gate hurriedly halted their footsteps. No one dared to sneak in together with the Demon Spirit King anymore.<br>They could only watch helplessly as the spirit formation gate closed up after the Demon Spirit King&rsquo;s war chariot entered it.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! Those bunch of selfish jerks! Would it kill them to just share a bit? I didn&rsquo;t think that Daoist Ninth Dragon would actually work together with the Demon Spirit King. That complicates things,&rdquo; Old Cat mumbled in displeasure.<br>Quite a few cultivators began leaving the area.<br>The viciousness of the powerhouses made them realize that their lives would be in danger if they continue lurking in the vicinity. Even if there was a rare fortuitous encounter waiting for them inside the demon coffin, it would be for naught if they lost their lives for it.<br>Not to mention, they couldn&rsquo;t even pass through the barrier at all.<br>Boom!<br>Shortly after the Demon Spirit King&rsquo;s war chariot entered the spirit formation gate, the earth began trembling. It seemed to be originating from where the gaseous flame was.<br>Jip jip jip jip!<br>Weird noises echoed. The crowd turned their sights over and saw a flock of blue birds surging out of the gaseous flame and rising toward the sky. They were the ones who were making those weird noises.<br>More and more blue birds joined the flock over time.<br>Some of them appeared to have noticed the presence of the cultivators and began heading in their direction. As they came closer, the cultivators realized that those blue birds were actually a thousand meters in length!<br>They resembled bats more than birds close-up, and they possessed a pair of sharp claws. They had white soulless eyes, and a sinister amalgamation of blue and violet gaseous flames was emanating from their bodies.<br>These blue birds rammed into the barrier, seeking to tear it apart so that they could attack the cultivators outside.<br>By this point, there were already more than tens of millions of blue birds in sight.<br>&ldquo;W-what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br>Many of the cultivators realized how frightening those massive blue birds were and panicked.<br>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to be natural beings. Did they manifest from a formation?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured.<br>The barrier had prevented him from sensing what was happening within, so he could only deduce the origin of those blue birds from their appearance.<br>&ldquo;They do seem to be beings manifested from a formation,&rdquo; Tao Wu and Old Cat replied at the same time.<br>Boom!<br>Boom!<br>Boom!<br>Deafening explosions echoed from inside the barrier. With each explosion, a new pillar of light would rise from the ground and surge into the sky. These pillars of light were so powerful that they pierced through even the barrier, though they would thin considerably afterward.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br>The rising pillars of light and the swiftly increasing population of blue birds sent the crowd&rsquo;s fear rising to the maximum. More and more cultivators fled from the scene.<br>&ldquo;This is a good opportunity.&rdquo;<br>However, Tao Wu was excited to see the pandemonium. He led Chu Feng and Old Cat toward the sky while the latter two kept completely quiet.<br>While the barrier was constantly repairing the holes caused by the penetration of the light barriers, it was unable to keep up with the rate at which new light pillars were appearing. This was indeed a good opportunity to sneak inside the barrier.<br>Tao Wu was planning to fly to the highest point of the barrier, where he would wait for a light pillar to emerge and quickly sneak in. There were also many other cultivators who made the same decision as him.<br>This resulted in two distinct groups amongst the crowd. The cowards were desperately fleeing for their lives whereas the courageous were waiting for a chance to sneak into the barrier.<br></p></div>
