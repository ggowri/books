        <h1>Chapter 5240</h1>
        <div>: Appearance of the Spirit Beasts<br>The spirit beast mountain range was so big that even cultivators weren&rsquo;t able to see it in full. This made it difficult for the guests to spectate the happenings in the competition. To resolve that problem the Situ World Spiritist Clan came up with a solution.<br>As soon as the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s juniors entered the mountain range, they quickly scattered in all directions. At the same time, Situ Tingye formed a hand seal with an ancient token in hand.<br>Weng!<br>A huge formation that projected the happenings inside the mountain range formed in the air. This formation was also constructed by the founder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>Weng!<br>A speck of light shone in the formation&rsquo;s projection<br>&ldquo;That is a spirit beast containing a secret formation! It appeared faster than usual!&rdquo;<br>The crowd was thrilled, especially those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan. There were many spirit beasts in the mountain valley, but only those that contained a secret formation within them were indicated by a speck of light.<br>When Situ Jingchuan captured the last spirit beast containing a secret formation fifty years ago, the spirit beast had only appeared in the later stages of the hunt. This time, however, a spirit beast containing a secret formation appeared right after the juniors entered the formation.<br>This was an indication that there were outstanding prodigies amongst the juniors entering the spirit beast mountain valley.<br>Weng!<br>Weng!<br>Weng!<br>More and more specks of light appeared, each one brighter than the previous. Within moments, there were already more than a hundred specks of light on the mirror. All of them indicated spirit beasts containing secret formations.<br>According to the ancient record, the founder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan had left around a hundred secret formations in the mountain valley. This meant that all of the spirit beasts containing secret formations had appeared all at once.<br>In other words, if someone was able to hunt down these spirit beasts, they would be able to obtain all of the secret formations!<br>&ldquo;Lord Tingye, why would this happen?&rdquo;<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen were bewildered by the sight before them. They anxiously turned their sights toward Situ Tingye, only to see him trembling in excitement.<br>&ldquo;Why would this happen? It goes without saying that our founder&rsquo;s formation has acknowledged the prodigies amongst our juniors and released those spirit beasts. Our Situ World Spiritist Clan is going to rise through the ranks!&rdquo; Situ Tingye said with a hearty laugh.<br>The other Situ World Spiritist Clansmen clenched their fists in excitement upon hearing those words.<br>Cheers broke out amongst the onlookers too. As fellow members of the True Dragon Starfield, the empowering of the Situ World Spiritist Clan would allow them to puff up their chest before the rest of the world too.<br>However, there was one person whose eyes were filled with regret&mdash;Tang Xiu.<br>He was not lying when he said that he had come here to watch the commotion. He did request to enter the spirit beast mountain range, but it was more of a passing remark. The rejection of the Situ World Spiritist Clan didn&rsquo;t really bother him much.<br>However, the appearance of so many spirit beasts containing the secret formations had enticed him.<br>Those were no ordinary formations but the ones left behind by the founder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan, a true powerhouse of the Totem Galaxy back in his era. Those secret formations were all priceless treasures!<br>&ldquo;Damn it! If only I knew that this would happen, I would have offered my treasures in exchange for the right to enter the mountain range.&rdquo;<br>Tang Xiu felt regretful thinking about it. He should have done everything he could to enter the mountain range. However, it was too late for regrets now.<br>There was no way the Situ World Spiritist Clan would allow their secret formations to fall into the hands of an outsider.<br>Soon, ordinary spirit beasts started to flood the mountain valley. Their quantity was more than a hundredfold of the usual amount, and they were still increasing by the second.<br>&ldquo;There are also so many more ordinary spirit beasts than usual. This is inconceivable! This current batch of juniors is indeed worthy of being labeled the strongest generation of our Situ World Spiritist Clan!&rdquo;<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen were excited to hear that.<br>Meanwhile, the juniors inside the formation quickly dove into action and tried to hunt down the spirit beasts that had started flooding him. To their dismay, these spirit beasts were much more difficult to hunt than they had thought.<br>Considering how even the success rate of hunting down ordinary spirit beasts was abysmally low, it was practically impossible for anyone to hunt down the spirit beasts containing the secret formations.<br>As time passed, some of the juniors started sustaining severe injuries from the spirit beasts.<br>&ldquo;The spirit beasts that have appeared this time around are exceptionally powerful, especially those containing the secret formations.&rdquo;<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen started getting worried.<br>As enticing as the spirit beasts containing the secret formations were, they were extremely hard to hunt. There was no point in them appearing in huge numbers if none of the juniors was able to take them down.<br>&ldquo;Calm down. You must have faith in our juniors. They are the strongest ever generation in our Situ World Spiritist Clan. If even they fail to hunt down those spirit beasts, no one else can,&rdquo; Situ Tingye said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Tingye is right.&rdquo;<br>Situ Tingye&rsquo;s words had calmed down the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen. They suppressed their worries and continued watching the situation.<br>&ldquo;Something seems to be amiss about those spirit beasts.&rdquo;<br>The crowd soon realized that the spirit beasts were heading in the same direction&mdash;the center of the mountain range.<br>&ldquo;Something is indeed amiss. Those spirit beasts seem to be gathering together. Are the spirit beasts containing the secret formations capable of communicating with the other spirit beasts? Are they ordering the other spirit beasts around?&rdquo;<br>The crowd threw out their conjectures.<br>Nevertheless, they thought that it was a good thing. It would be much easier for the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan to hunt those spirit beasts down when they were lumped together.<br>However, the crowd fell speechless when the spirit beasts finally arrived at the center of the mountain range.<br>The spirit beasts were standing in an orderly formation where the spirit beasts containing the secret formation were standing around the ordinary spirit beasts, protecting them. As a result, the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan found themselves unable to get to the ordinary spirit beasts at all.<br>They did try to bombard attacks on the spirit beasts containing the secret formations, but they were unable to breach their defenses.<br>It was the same for the two rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation prodigies too. After all, some of the spirit beasts actually possessed power nearing peak Martial Exalted level.<br>Instead of hunting down the spirit beasts, it was the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan who were slowly getting injured instead.<br>&ldquo;Damn it. What&rsquo;s wrong with those spirit beasts? Are they playing tricks with us?&rdquo; the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan cried in confusion.<br>Even the elders outside the mountain valley were bewildered too.<br>&ldquo;Step aside. Allow me to give it a try instead.&rdquo;<br>A person stepped out from the crowd. It was Situ Jingchuan.<br>&ldquo;Senior Jingchuan, let&rsquo;s join forces.&rdquo;<br>The other two prodigies who were on the same level as Situ Jingchuan spoke up.<br>&ldquo;Juniors, the power of the spirit beasts belongs to those who are deserving of it. It&rsquo;s against the rules of our founder to join hands against the spirit beasts,&rdquo; Situ Jingchuan said.<br>The other two prodigies sneered upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;Senior Jingchuan, are you sure that you have the strength to monopolize these resources? Look at the spirit beasts we have here. Do you think that you can take them all by yourself?&rdquo; one of them scoffed.<br>Situ Jingchuan was also at rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation too. He was only dubbed the number one prodigy of the Situ World Spiritist Clan because he had managed to hunt a spirit beast containing a secret formation fifty years ago.<br>The two of them didn&rsquo;t think that Situ Jingchuan was worthy of that title, especially since they had already caught up with him despite being of a younger age.<br>&ldquo;Juniors, you can see for yourself whether I have the capability for that,&rdquo; Situ Jingchuan said.<br>He opened his palm and a pearl-shaped formation rose into the sky. It swiftly expanded to a hulking size that spanned over a hundred thousand meters in length. Even before the formation had fully formed, the world had already started shaking and the surrounding space showed signs of collapsing.<br>The crowd paled at the sight of the formation.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Myriad Swords Massacre Formation. It&rsquo;s the secret formation that Situ Jingchuan obtained from the spirit beast mountain range fifty years ago, but it can only be grasped by a rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist&hellip; Situ Jingchuan has actually reached rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation!&rdquo;<br>The crowd widened their eyes in realization.<br>It was no wonder why Situ Jingchuan hadn&rsquo;t made a move all this while. There was no need for him to work together with the other two prodigies now that his spirit power had already reached rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>In truth, he had been biding his time and secretly constructing this formation.<br>&ldquo;It must be fate. I obtained this secret formation from here fifty years ago, and now, I&rsquo;m employing it for the first time here too.. How exciting. This must be the will of our founder. Lord Founder wants me, Situ Jingchuan, to make all of you submit to me. Your strength will be mine today!&rdquo; Situ Jingchuan declared.<br>With the activation of the Myriad Swords Massacre Formation, countless swords whizzed across the sky to fall upon the spirit beast army. The sheer destructive might was so great that it shattered even space.<br>Grar!<br>The spirit beasts roared in response to the rain of swords. White light surfaced from their bodies and manifested in a formation.<br>The spirit beasts were actually invoking a formation!<br>The spirit beasts&rsquo; formation not only stopped the rain of swords but also utterly decimated the Myriad Swords Massacre Formation. This dealt a severe backlash to Situ Jingchuan, causing him to spew blood and stagger.<br>If not for his juniors stepping forward to support him, he would have fallen to the ground.<br>&ldquo;This!&rdquo;<br>Situ Tingye couldn&rsquo;t keep his calm anymore.<br>Situ Jingchuan had already performed beyond expectations. If even the Myriad Swords Massacre Formation was insufficient to deal with the spirit beasts, the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance at all.<br>&ldquo;What a bunch of wastrels. Think about how disappointed your founder must be!&rdquo; a voice suddenly echoed amongst the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>The crowd quickly turned their eyes over to identify the one who had said those brazen words. At the same time, the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan stepped away to isolate him.<br>Initially, the crowd was still confused why a junior of the Situ World Spiritist Clan would insult themselves, but when they finally got a closer look at the person&rsquo;s appearance, Situ Tingye, Situ Hongbo, and the others were unable to remain calm anymore.<br>They could tell right away that he was none other than Chu Feng, whom they had met at the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm.<br>&ldquo;How did he enter the spirit beast mountain range?&rdquo;<br>Situ Hongbo immediately realized that things had gone awry.<br></div>
