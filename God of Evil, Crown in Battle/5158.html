        <h1>Chapter 5157</h1>
        <div>: Trash?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Lord Qin Jiu, I&rsquo;m thankful for the help you have offered me back then, but I know that I am not the person you wish to pass down your legacy to. By a stroke of fate, I stumbled upon an outstanding junior. He might just be the successor you&rsquo;re looking for. If that&rsquo;s truly the case, this will be my way of repaying your grace.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s projection crossed his legs and sat down. His appearance began to change. His snowy hair fell off and his body began to shrivel up. In the blink of an eye, he looked like a terrifying corpse.<br>Even so, there was still a hint of vitality in his eyes.<br>When he finally closed his eyes too, the hall fell deathly still.<br>&hellip;<br>Meanwhile, those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan found themselves shrouded by spirit power before being teleported out of the ancient remnant.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>Those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan were baffled by the situation. They had been waiting in the ancient remnant for Bai Yunqing to return, but they were abruptly teleported out. Knowing how important the ancient remnant was to them, they quickly turn their sights back to the ancient remnant, only to find that it had vanished without a trace.<br>This meant that it was no longer possible for them to return to the ancient remnant anymore. Even the treasures they had painstakingly gathered to activate the ancient remnant had lost their effectiveness.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that Bai Yunqing has succeeded? The ancient remnant might have evicted us due to that.&rdquo;<br>Situ Tingye felt indignant. He was still planning to steal the legacy from Bai Yunqing, but the situation no longer allowed for it.<br>Weng!<br>A teleportation formation suddenly appeared, and a person fell out from within. It was none other than Bai Yunqing.<br>Along with his arrival came an awful stench.<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen immediately covered their noses and mouths as they assessed Bai Yunqing. They couldn&rsquo;t help but scrunch up their faces.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that on his body? Is that feces?&rdquo;<br>No matter how they looked at it, the yellow substance covering Bai Yunqing simply looked like poop.<br>&ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo;<br>It was then that Bai Yunqing finally woke up. He immediately activated his Heavenly Bloodline, raising his cultivation from rank two Half-God level to rank four Half-God level. At the same time, he exerted a terrifying killing intent that crushed down on the vicinity.<br>&ldquo;Remember this. You aren&rsquo;t to talk about this matter to anyone, or else I&rsquo;ll erase the Situ World Spiritist Clan from the Totem Galaxy!&rdquo;<br>Spitting those words out, Bai Yunqing turned around and left the area.<br>Despite their initial plans to rob Bai Yunqing, Situ Tingye and the others made no attempts to stop Bai Yunqing from leaving. They were too afraid to make a move. They didn&rsquo;t think that Bai Yunqing actually had the ability to raise his cultivation by two ranks to rank four Half-God level.<br>No longer confident about dealing with Bai Yunqing anymore, Situ Tingye dared not to take the risk.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that he was this powerful. Taishi Xingzhong really took in a formidable disciple. It looks like there&rsquo;s yet another incredible prodigy in our Totem Galaxy,&rdquo; Situ Tingye murmured in cold sweat.<br>He was relieved that he didn&rsquo;t recklessly make a move the moment Bai Yunqing appeared, or else he would have been in deep trouble.<br>&ldquo;Grand Elder, how is Bai Yunqing that strong? With his cultivation level, there are no juniors in the Totem Galaxy who can match him other than those few,&rdquo; an elder exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all. You have to remember that he&rsquo;s the closed-door disciple of Taishi Xingzhong, which means that he&rsquo;s bound to mature into a formidable world spiritist. In my view, Bai Yunqing can definitely be considered one of the top juniors in the current Totem Galaxy, second only to<br>. It&rsquo;s fortunate that I didn&rsquo;t make a move on him, or else we would have been in deep trouble.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen couldn&rsquo;t help but pat their chests in relief.<br>&ldquo;But why is Bai Yunqing covered in feces?&rdquo; one of them asked.<br>&ldquo;How do I know? Why don&rsquo;t you ask him?&rdquo; Situ Tingye replied with a darkened face.<br>Naturally, the other elders dared not to harp on this issue.<br>Situ Tingye was feeling incredibly frustrated now. Despite the effort he had put into activating the ancient remnant, he didn&rsquo;t manage to get anything out of it. Not only so, but he didn&rsquo;t manage to find out what had happened inside the ancient remnant at all.<br>It was no wonder why he felt so stifled!<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng was also teleported out of the ancient remnant, though fortunately, he landed in an area far away from where the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen were.<br>He felt extremely indignant despite having received a clue about the legacy. It wasn&rsquo;t easy for him to capture Old Cat, but he ended up losing sight of the latter just like that. Given how cunning Old Cat was, it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to capture him once more.<br>Weng!<br>Another teleportation formation suddenly appeared, and a figure fell out from within. Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes lit up in delight.<br>It was Old Cat.<br>&ldquo;It looks like Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s formation possesses some degree of intelligence. He teleported Old Cat to the same location as me,&rdquo; Chu Feng muttered with a smile.<br>Unexpectedly, Old Cat also broke out in a smile.<br>&ldquo;Brat, are you sure that the formation possesses intelligence?&rdquo;<br>Old Cat slowly rose to its feet. With a casual shake, the shackles fell from its body. The assault formation Chu Feng had constructed earlier had reverted back to its original potency after losing the enhancement of the ancient remnant&rsquo;s energy, so it was no longer enough to trap Old Cat.<br>&ldquo;Rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation? Not bad, you improved quite a lot,&rdquo; Old Cat remarked as he assessed the dissipating spirit power.<br>&ldquo;Thanks for your compliment,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Compliment? Hahaha!&rdquo;<br>Old Cat&rsquo;s smile widened even further. He looked at Chu Feng and sneered, &ldquo;I am impressed by how much your cultivation has grown over the last few years, but now I find myself wondering if you have paid the price for it with your intelligence.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh? What makes you say so?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied, feigning ignorance.<br>&ldquo;What makes me say so? Don&rsquo;t you know that you&rsquo;re a weakling before me now that you are without the enhancement of the ancient remnant&rsquo;s energy?&rdquo;<br>Old Cat exerted his oppressive might on Chu Feng, proudly displaying his prowess as a rank three Half-God level cultivator.<br></p></div>
