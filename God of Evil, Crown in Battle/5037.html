        <div>: Life Chain Formation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, this formation is intended to protect you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Protect me? Friend, do you take me for a fool?&rdquo;<br>Jiang Kongping didn&rsquo;t believe Chu Feng&rsquo;s words at all.<br>&ldquo;Activate!&rdquo;<br>Instead of wasting time on words, Chu Feng began forming a series of hand seals to activate the formation. Light began emanating from the formation, and two surges of aura rushed out from the formation. These two surges of aura swiftly morphed into two worms.<br>These worms didn&rsquo;t have any eyes, but they had a large mouth filled with horrifyingly sharp teeth. They looked like something that had manifested from a nightmare.<br>Shoosh!<br>One of the worms rushed toward Jiang Kongping, leaving the latter shuddering in fright. He tried to escape, but he couldn&rsquo;t dodge at all with his body bound by Chu Feng. He could only watch helplessly as the worm dived into his body and entered his soul.<br>But to his surprise, the worm didn&rsquo;t inflict any harm on him. There was no pain whatsoever throughout the process. Instead, the worm dissipated into innumerable imprints that covered his soul.<br>Following that, the other worm also began wriggling. It dived straight for Chu Feng&rsquo;s body and entered his soul.<br>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you being too serious here? There&rsquo;s no need to go this far.&rdquo;<br>Jiang Kongping finally realized the use of the formation and let out a deep sigh. The formation that was just cast on the two of them was a linking formation that connected both of their fates.<br>Chu Feng had to do this because he knew just how powerful his enemies were. He would have to prepare sufficient trump cards beforehand if he wished to escape alive from a confrontation with such enemies.<br>And his greatest trump card at the moment was none other than Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s life.<br>&ldquo;Since you know the use of this formation, you should pray hard that those from the Dao Pill Immortal Sect truly value your life. Otherwise, the two of us will be dying together,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Following that, they resumed their journey and soon arrived at the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>There were much more people gathered in the Nine Souls Sacred Clan as compared to when Chu Feng visited this place a few days ago. It was only to be expected since this was the first time that the Nine Souls Sacred Clan was giving out cultivation pills for free to all cultivators.<br>Most people wouldn&rsquo;t want to miss this rare opportunity.<br>There were even some who had sustained severe injuries and were too weak to walk who were carried into the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. No one wanted to miss this rare opportunity.<br>Most of them had joyous looks on their faces.<br>In truth, there was already a group of people who had collected the pills and swallowed them, and the results were as good as the rumors put them out to be. This had built up anticipation amongst those who had yet to receive it.<br>Chu Feng was interested to know what Sima Xiangtu and the Pill Dao Immortal Sect were up to, so he secretly captured three cultivators who had ingested the pill for examination. The three of them did manage to advance their cultivation significantly as a result of the pill, but at the same time, their souls had been opened up and couldn&rsquo;t be closed in the short run.<br>That wouldn&rsquo;t pose a problem to cultivators, but if one were to look at them not as cultivators but as ingredients for concocting pills, there would be a huge issue here.<br>The first step to concocting a pill was to first refine the ingredients. The purpose was so as to allow the ingredients to better mix with each other and release their medicinal properties.<br>The process of that was uncannily similar to the cultivators who had ingested the cultivation pill.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s indeed a huge scheme behind this.&rdquo;<br>Sensing that something was amiss, Chu Feng immediately brought Jiang Kongping out.<br>&ldquo;Friend, friend, my good friend, just let me off, will you? Besides, you&rsquo;ll also suffer the same pain if you injure me right now. If you want to save your friends, you can use my name all you want. Sima Xiangtu wouldn&rsquo;t dare to go against you with me in your grasp!&rdquo; Jiang Kongping uttered fearfully.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry and do as I&rsquo;ve said. I won&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng issued some instructions to Jiang Kongping<br>&ldquo;I see. No problem, friend. You can count it on me. I&rsquo;ll get it done!&rdquo;<br>Jiang Kongping rose into the sky afterward.<br>They were currently in the territory of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. While practically everyone here was a cultivator, they consciously chose to steer clear of the sky as a sign of respect for the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>In other words, Jiang Kongping was the only one standing in mid-air.<br>&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo;<br>Looking at the crowd below, Jiang Kongping cleared his throat before speaking.<br>&ldquo;Trash of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, do turn your lowly eyes over here for a moment!&rdquo;<br>All of those who heard his voice immediately turned their gazes over.<br>Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s jarring words were one thing, but the fact that he dared to occupy the sky despite not being a member of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan was an act of blatant disrespect for the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that? Is he tired of living?&rdquo;<br>Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s white robe was embroidered with the words &lsquo;Dao Pill Immortal Sect&rsquo;, but most cultivators in the Nine Souls Sacred Clan hadn&rsquo;t heard of the Dao Pill Immortal Sect before. It was an existence too far away from them. Thus, they began hurling curses at him.<br>&ldquo;Pill Dao Immortal Sect? It can&rsquo;t be that Pill Dao Immortal Sect that I&rsquo;m thinking of, right? Is that guy trying to impersonate as a member of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect?&rdquo;<br>Meanwhile, those who had heard of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect looked at Jiang Kongping with eyes filled with skepticism.<br>Even those who knew about the Pill Dao Immortal Sect had only heard rumors about it. They couldn&rsquo;t ascertain whether the person in front of him was really a member of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect or not.<br>&ldquo;Who dares to cause trouble in our Nine Souls Sacred Clan?&rdquo;<br>Needless to say, those from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan wouldn&rsquo;t turn a blind eye to Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s provocation. They drew their swords and released their oppressive might, intending to capture Jiang Kongping and punish him for his insolence.<br>&ldquo;Hold it right there!&rdquo;<br>But before the guards of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan could make a move, a furious bellow suddenly echoed from afar. Following that, a large group of people swiftly flitted over from afar.<br>Most of them were elders and elites of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, but the one standing at the forefront wasn&rsquo;t a member of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan but Sima Xiangtu.<br></p></div>
