        <h1>Chapter 3013</h1>
        <div> - Sharp Gaze<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>For the sake of not provoking Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s frightening mother, Chu Zhiyuan and Chu Ruoshi, the pair who were originally hoping for Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s death, started to dramatically put forth all of their strength to help her.<br>Merely, with the power that they possessed, it would not be an easy task for them to treat Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s serious injury.<br>Thus, in the end, it was the two Supreme Elders that acted to save Chu Lingxi, who was in imminent peril.<br>Of course, the two Supreme Elders deliberately concealed their tracks and gave the meritorious service of saving Chu Lingxi to Chu Zhiyuan and Chu Ruoshi.<br>After saving Chu Lingxi from the brink of death, the four of them began to proceed outward whilst bringing Chu Lingxi along with them.<br>In the beginning, they were confused in regards to where Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu and the others had gone to. However, when they reached the entrance of the cave, they discovered that Chu Haoyan and the others were all present. They moved toward them and asked them what had happened.<br>It turned out that the commotion from the battle against Chu Youyuan was too strong; even the cave started to tremble. Fearing that the cave would collapse, those younger generations ran out in fear.<br>Upon finding out about this, the two Supreme Elders started to ridicule those younger generations&rsquo; ignorance in their hearts. The rocks in that place were so firm, not even they could shatter them. Thus, how could the cave possibly collapse?<br>Of course, the ones to ask the other party were actually not them. Instead, it was Chu Haoyan and the others.<br>Although Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather participated in the conspiracy, Chu Haoyan did not know anything about it.<br>Thus, he simply had no idea that his grandfather was one of the two seriously injured younger generations. Because of that, he was not concerned with their injuries in the slightest. The only thing he was concerned about were the treasures located deep in the cave.<br>As expected, Chu Zhiyuan and the others began to tell the lie that they had prepared.<br>&ldquo;Damn it, I knew that Chu Feng couldn't be so kind as to bring all of us here. Sure enough, he planned to hog all of the treasures for himself,&rdquo; upon hearing the lies, Chu Haoyan decided to believe them without the slightest hesitation. Not only that, but he even started to speak ill of Chu Feng.<br>After all, he was one of the people among the crowd present that desired Chu Feng&rsquo;s miserable death the most. Finding out that Chu Feng had died, he would naturally be very happy.<br>However, even with that being the case, he still had to speak ill of Chu Feng, still had to hold him in disdain. Even in death, he still did not plan to let Chu Feng off. He wanted to completely ruin Chu Feng&rsquo;s reputation.<br>&ldquo;I have truly trusted him in vain. Never would I have imagined Chu Feng to be that sort of person.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Serves him right. Someone like him deserved to die. That is the price of his greed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is truly a pity though. We have wasted our time coming here for nothing.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, apart from Chu Lingxi, who was still unconscious, everyone else started to speak ill of Chu Feng. They were, after all, people with no mind of their own, people that would go to whichever side was more advantageous.<br>Suddenly, a person among the crowd asked, &ldquo;But&hellip; since Chu Feng has died, how are we to leave this place?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We only reached this place by following Chu Feng. Now that he&rsquo;s dead, how are we to leave?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That damned Chu Feng, isn&rsquo;t he bringing harm upon us?!&rdquo;<br>After that person asked how they would leave, the crowd reacted as if they&rsquo;d been awakened from a dream. Immediately, panic, confusion and anger emerged in the crowd. Then, they began to curse out at Chu Feng. It was as if all of the responsibility, all of the fault, lay with Chu Feng, even though they&rsquo;d willingly decided to journey here.<br>At the moment when the crowd was panicking and at a loss as to what to do, Chu Zhiyuan seized the opportunity and stood forth. He said, &ldquo;I remember the way here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; However, the crowd immediately started to question Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s claim. Not only that, but they even looked at him with contempt in their eyes.<br>They seemed to be looking at someone who was making a fool out of himself.<br>&ldquo;Chu Zhiyuan, was your head beaten stupid by Chu Feng? You&rsquo;ve actually learned how to make outrageous claims too?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph, instead of learning what&rsquo;s good, you only know how to learn what&rsquo;s bad.&rdquo;<br>Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu, those two geniuses of the Chu Heavenly Clan, even began to mock Chu Zhiyuan.<br>After Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu started mocking Chu Zhiyuan, many others present also seized the opportunity to mock Chu Zhiyuan too.<br>None of them believed in Chu Zhiyuan. They all felt that Chu Zhiyuan was nothing but a pretty boy gigolo, a piece of trash.<br>In the end, it was only when Chu Ruoshi stood forth for Chu Zhiyuan that the crowd stopped their ridicule.<br>&ldquo;Do any of you know the way out of here?&rdquo; Chu Ruoshi asked loudly.<br>The crowd went completely silent. If they knew the way to leave, they would&rsquo;ve left already. There would be no reason for them to stay here.<br>&ldquo;Since you all do not know the way out of here, then behave yourselves and follow my big brother Zhiyuan. Otherwise&hellip; do not blame us should you end up dying here.&rdquo;<br>Chu Ruoshi unleashed her oppressive might. Her words were also very sharp. Faintly, one could even feel the coldness emitted by her from the surrounding air.<br>Such a Chu Ruoshi was fully deserving of being the ruler among the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations. No one dared to go against her, and no one dared to refute her. Not even Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu dared to do so.<br>&ldquo;Since no one has any objections, I, Chu Zhiyuan, will show the way for my brothers and sisters. Everyone, please follow me closely. Do not fall behind,&rdquo; Chu Zhiyuan said those words and then walked to the front of the crowd. He was prepared to lead the crowd out.<br>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; however, right at that moment, Chu Haoyan suddenly spoke. He looked to Chu Zhiyuan and asked, &ldquo;Chu Zhiyuan, are you really going to guide us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chu Zhiyuan replied.<br>&ldquo;In that case, don&rsquo;t blame me for speaking bluntly. If you are still leading us around when the Nine Moons Sacred Domain closes, do not blame me for killing you first,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan threatened with a cold tone.<br>&ldquo;Chu Haoyan, you are truly&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Ruoshi stood forth again.<br>However, before Chu Ruoshi could finish, Chu Zhiyuan waved his sleeve.<br>After waving his sleeve, the tyrannical Chu Ruoshi actually became completely obedient like a lamb and moved back.<br>As for Chu Zhiyuan, he had a smile on his face.<br>Calmly, he looked to Chu Haoyan and said, &ldquo;Haoyan, if I am still unable to lead everyone out of here by the time the Nine Moons Sacred Domain closes, then even without you doing anything, I, Chu Zhiyuan, will commit suicide by cutting my own throat to apologize to everyone.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Zhiyuan turned around and started walking. The crowd hurriedly followed after him.<br>Only Chu Haoyan was standing there, stunned.<br>He felt as if he were seeing things wrong. When Chu Zhiyuan was speaking to him, he felt his gaze to be extremely sharp. That was a gaze that he had never felt before. At the very least, it was the first time he had felt such a sharp gaze from Chu Zhiyuan.<br>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; however, Chu Haoyan soon let out a cold snort and said with a soft voice, &ldquo;After leaving this place, I will teach you a lesson.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, he also followed after Chu Zhiyuan.<br>Even though he greatly detested Chu Zhiyuan, he still wanted to leave. After all, if they did not leave the Nine Moons Sacred Domain within the time limit, the only thing waiting for them would be death. <br></p></div>
