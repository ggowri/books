        <div> - The Serious Chu Feng<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Since young master Han Yu has no objections to the suggestions, is young master Chu Feng willing to accept the suggestions too?&rdquo;<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er turned her gaze to Chu Feng.<br>When Xia Yun&rsquo;er said those words, many of the people present felt that she was asking something that everyone knew the answer to already.<br>Everyone felt that he would most definitely accept the suggestions. After all, those suggestions were so very advantageous toward him.<br>&ldquo;Regarding miss Xia&rsquo;s first suggestion, this Chu Feng has no objections.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because I believe young master Han Yu would not want my cyan glass ball if I am to lose.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;On the other hand, I do fancy young master Han Yu&rsquo;s golden glass ball quite a bit,&rdquo; Chu Feng did not try to hide his desire, and spoke the truth.<br>The crowd present were not in the slightest bit surprised by Chu Feng&rsquo;s response. They had already anticipated that Chu Feng would accept the suggestion.<br>Only a fool would refuse such an advantageous thing.<br>At that moment, Han Yu was cursing Chu Feng for being shameless in his heart.<br>He felt that Chu Feng was simply too shameless to act so bold and confident as if he were righteous even when taking advantage of someone.<br>&ldquo;However, as for the second suggestion, I think it is unsuitable,&rdquo; Chu Feng continued.<br>&ldquo;What? Unsuitable?&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd&rsquo;s mouths all dropped to the floor.<br>&ldquo;Really? He refused it? He actually refused?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why did he do that? It&rsquo;s a great opportunity that Xia Yun&rsquo;er obtained, why would Chu Feng refuse it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that he wants face, and does not want Xia Yun&rsquo;er to help him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Or could it be that he really does possess absolute confidence in being able to defeat Han Yu, a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, as a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd looked to one another and started to discuss spiritedly among themselves. They all had the same sort of expression on their faces: confusion.<br>Even Han Yu had a stunned expression on his face. He did not dare to believe what he had just heard.<br>Chu Feng actually refused such a great opportunity?<br>Could it be that there was something wrong with Chu Feng&rsquo;s head?<br>Li Xiang stepped forth and said, &ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s unsuitable about it? I find it very suitable,&rdquo;<br>As Li Xiang wanted Chu Feng to win, he did not wish for Chu Feng to renounce such an opportunity.<br>&ldquo;By fair, both parties should utilize their full strength. Otherwise, it would be meaningless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since I accepted this match, I cannot use my weakness to request for someone stronger than myself to weaken their own strength,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Good, well spoken,&rdquo; at that moment, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder was unable to contain himself, and spoke to praise Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, many of the people present began to raise their thumbs toward Chu Feng in their hearts.<br>They were all feeling admiration toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit.<br>However, there was also a small portion of people that felt that Chu Feng was being pretentious. Xia Yun&rsquo;er had strived for an opportunity for him, yet he refused to use it. With that, he would only bring disgrace upon himself.<br>This was what the great majority of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were thinking about Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xia, I feel that there is nothing wrong with your suggestion. However, it is not that I am not willing to do as you suggested. Rather, it is brother Chu Feng who is unwilling,&rdquo; Han Yu said.<br>Han Yu actually did not wish to do as Xia Yun&rsquo;er suggested from the bottom of his heart. And now, an opportunity had presented itself before him. Naturally, he would push all the blame onto Chu Feng.<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er smiled lightly. She said, &ldquo;I merely put forth the two suggestions so that this chess match would be more fair. However, since young master Chu Feng feels that it would only be fair should the two of you both utilize your full strengths, we should respect young master Chu Feng&rsquo;s decision.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, since this is the case, we can start now, yes?&rdquo; Han Yu had a joyous expression on his face. He was rejoicing from the bottom of his heart.<br>Han Yu felt that as long as he could unleash his full strength, Chu Feng would undoubtedly be defeated.<br>Most importantly, he had agreed to Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s request to use only Snake Mark Immortal-level spirit power.<br>However, the request was refused by Chu Feng. Thus, even if he was to win, no one would say that he had had an unfair advantage in the match.<br>They would only say that Chu Feng had brought disgrace upon himself.<br>&ldquo;We can begin,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, allow me to experience brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess skills.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Han Yu&rsquo;s Dragon Mark Immortal-level spirit power started to emerge from his body. Like a tide, it began to surge into the chess pieces.<br>At the same time, Chu Feng also unleashed his spirit power and instilled it into his chess pieces.<br>This time around, Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power was much more powerful than when he was confronting Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi.<br>At that moment, Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi felt very displeased.<br>At that moment, they finally realized why they were defeated by Chu Feng earlier. It turned out that Chu Feng was holding back and deliberately hid his strength.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power was actually stronger than their own. It was no wonder they would lose to him.<br>&lsquo;Chu Feng, even if you are to go all out, you will still be defeated. The disgrace and humiliation you&rsquo;ve bestowed us will be completely repaid by Han Yu,&rsquo; Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi thought in their hearts.<br>It was actually not only the two of them that felt that way. Practically everyone present thought Chu Feng couldn't win.<br>Even though Chu Feng had unleashed his full strength now, it remained that he was only a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Compared to Han Yu&rsquo;s Dragon Mark Immortal spirit power, his was simply too inferior.<br>Actually, as the chess board only possessed a limited space, the quantity of spirit power unleashed by Chu Feng and Han Yu was practically the same. The two of them had practically unleashed the full potential the chess board could allow.<br>However, in terms of grandeur, the disparity between them was enormous.<br>If Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power was akin to a surging river with vast and mighty power, then Han Yu&rsquo;s spirit power would be an ocean with surging waves that reached the sky itself.<br>&ldquo;Kill~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a shout was heard from the chess board.<br>It was Han Yu&rsquo;s chess pieces. Not only did his chess pieces seem to be vividly alive, but they were actually capable of speaking. How could they be considered to be chess pieces? They were simply real living beings.<br>As the deafening shouting of &lsquo;kill&rsquo; continued, Han Yu&rsquo;s chess pieces started to orderly and gradually press on toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess pieces.<br>That&rsquo;s right, he did not rush his chess pieces toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess pieces. Instead, he was slowly moving them toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s chess pieces.<br>He was planning to use his own might to scare Chu Feng and make him crumble in fear. He wanted to utterly defeat Chu Feng.<br>In fact, he had indeed managed to accomplish that.<br>His chess piece army was indeed very powerful. This was not his own favorable impression toward his chess pieces. Instead, this was the feeling that everyone present felt.<br>Han Yu&rsquo;s chess pieces army was simply too powerful in terms of both momentum and strength.<br>If one were to compare Han Yu&rsquo;s chess piece army with Chu Feng&rsquo;s, then it would be akin to comparing a group of robust adults to a group of two-year-old children.<br>With how enormous of a difference in strength there was between the two parties and how the two parties both possessed identical numbers, this was simply a battle with no suspense.<br>However, at the moment when the crowd felt that Chu Feng must be scared witless already, when they wanted to see Chu Feng panic in fear and want to give up on the chess match, they were all stunned when they turned to look at Chu Feng.<br>They were surprised to discover that Chu Feng not only did not have any traces of panic on his face, but his gaze was instead burning like a torch while being completely fixed on the chessboard. He was like a marshal overseeing the changes on the battlefield.<br>At the same time, his expression was very serious. It was as if he was completely absorbed in the chessboard and unable to hear what the others said.<br>This meant one thing: Chu Feng was extremely serious.<br>This seriousness was something that Chu Feng did not possess when he was contending against Yuwen Tingyi and Yuwen Hualong.<br>Apart from the seriousness on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face, the crowd also noticed that Chu Feng continued to have a confident expression.<br>Even after things had reached this state, Chu Feng still felt that he would be able to win.<br>The crowd members were all frightened by Chu Feng&rsquo;s confidence.<br>&ldquo;How could Chu Feng remain this confident even with such a vast disparity in strength? Could it be that he really possesses the means to handle Han Yu?&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression, the crowd suddenly started to feel a bit of confidence in Chu Feng. They felt that Chu Feng might really possess the means to confront Han Yu.<br>That said, the crowd still did not know how Chu Feng would take on Han Yu&rsquo;s chess piece army.<br><br><br>Check out the June Giveaway for a chance to win $200, $100 or $50 Visa Gift Card<br><br><br></p></div>
