        <h1>Chapter 3194</h1>
        <div> - The Ruler Of the Overlord Region<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;That is?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng immediately grew nervous upon seeing the black gaseous flames. A worried expression appeared on his face.<br>The reason for that was because the black gaseous flames were formed by that black silhouette. This meant that even though Bai Liluo had devoured the black silhouette, she had yet to completely refine him.<br>Currently, the black silhouette was attacking Bai Liluo, and had brought quite a lot of pain and suffering to her. If Bai Liluo were unable to refine him, things would become very dangerous for her.<br>As for Bai Liluo, she had evidently realized this problem too. Thus, she immediately sat down cross-legged, began to set up a spirit formation, and used her own power to suppress the black silhouette.<br>As Bai Liluo suppressed it, the black silhouette soon started to wane. At the same time, Bai Liluo&rsquo;s painful expression also started to ease.<br>Bai Liluo opened her eyes and said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, big sister will have to take some time to suppress this guy. You can leave first. When I finish taking care of him, I will come and find you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you need my help?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need. I can handle this matter myself. My strength is above his. Back then, I only never attacked him because I was deceived by him, and had truly thought him to be my younger brother. Because of that, I ended up allowing him to benefit from me, and even obtain the same strength as my own.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, he is now injured because of you, and I will no longer show him any mercy. As such, he&rsquo;s no longer a match for me. I merely need some time in order to refine him completely.&rdquo;<br>Worried that Chu Feng would still be worried, Bai Liluo added, &ldquo;I am truly capable of this. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well. In that case, I will return. Take care of yourself,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist to Bai Liluo.<br>Chu Feng did not wish to obstruct her either. After all, she was still sitting cross-legged on the ground with her hands forming hand seals as she talked to him. This meant that she must quickly suppress the black silhouette, or else the black silhouette would strike back at her again.<br>Thus, after verifying that Bai Liluo did not need his assistance, Chu Feng prepared to leave.<br>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; however, at the moment when Chu Feng was about to leave, Bai Liluo&rsquo;s voice was heard again.<br>&ldquo;Little brother, thank you. If it wasn&rsquo;t for you, I might never have known the truth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And I&hellip; would one day have died at that guy&rsquo;s hands. If that were to truly happen, I would have suffered enormous grievances.&rdquo;<br>Bai Liluo&rsquo;s eyes were filled with gratefulness as she said those words to Chu Feng.<br>Grateful, how could she not be grateful? If it wasn&rsquo;t for Chu Feng&rsquo;s secret voice transmission to her, Bai Liluo would not have put on a performance for the black silhouette with him. She would also not have been able to discover the truth.<br>As for the truth, it was simply too important to her. This truth would greatly alleviate the guilt and remorse she felt toward the villagers and her big sister.<br>It could be said that a boulder crushing down on Bai Liluo&rsquo;s heart was finally lifted.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for thanks. However, since you&rsquo;re that much older than me and have treated me very well, I will recognize you as my older sister.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if you are to recognize me as your younger brother, you must prepare yourself to take care of my mess. After all, I&rsquo;m someone who is especially fond of inviting trouble,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Bai Liluo with a smile.<br>&ldquo;I will definitely not let anyone that dares to bully my little brother Chu Feng get away,&rdquo; Bai Liluo spoke with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Big sister, train at ease. After you&rsquo;ve refined that monster completely, you will not only have avenged yourself, but you will have also avenged all your relatives from the village,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Little brother, you can be at ease too. Big sister will definitely get her revenge,&rdquo; Bai Liluo was filled with confidence as she said those words.<br>&ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist.<br>Then, Chu Feng left. The reason he left so quickly was because he noticed that Bai Liluo&rsquo;s expression became slightly ugly after only conversing with him for a short amount of time.<br>This meant that the black silhouette had begun to attack Bai Liluo again, and she had to suppress it quickly. Chu Feng did not wish to delay her.<br>After all, the current Bai Liluo could not afford to waste the slightest bit of time.<br>After leaving, Chu Feng immediately proceeded toward the direction of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory. Fortunately, although the place he had currently found him in was remote, it was not very far from the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory.<br>One thing worthy of mentioning was that when Chu Feng returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan, he found that people from the Dongguo Heavenly Clan were also there.<br>Not only were the Mighty Dongguo Duo present, but even the Dongguo Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s strongest individual in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, Dongguo Bingyu, was also present.<br>They had brought several people of the younger generation with them. Those people must be the Dongguo Heavenly Clansmen that had just entered that year, the people that they were planning to bring to the Overlord Region to participate in the Celebration of the New Excellence.<br>As it was a Celebration of the New Excellence, it was meaningless for others to go there.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng left to participate in the Celebration of the New Excellence with only Chu Qing, Chu Shuangshuang, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu.<br>Before leaving, Chu Feng reminded the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan repeatedly that, before they returned, no matter what sort of cultivation resource they might have discovered, they could not leave the main city.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had a premonition that he would undoubtedly offend people again whilst participating in the Celebration of the New Excellence.<br>Chu Feng could not help it. After all, struggles inevitably emerged from places with martial cultivators. This was even more so for a place like the Celebration of the New Excellence, where one could strive for cultivation resources.<br>While Chu Feng was not afraid himself, he did not wish for the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan to be implicated by his actions. As such, staying inside the main city was the safest course of action for them.<br>As for the cultivation opportunities that they would miss, Chu Feng could only wait until he became powerful, and then think of a way to reimburse them then.<br>Guided by Dongguo Bingyu, Chu Feng and the others finally arrived outside the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s Overlord Region.<br>The reason why they were said to have arrived at the outside of it was because the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s Overlord Region was isolated with a very powerful spirit formation. There was only a single entrance from the Eastern Region to the Overlord Region, a spirit formation gate leading to the Overlord Region.<br>That spirit formation gate was extremely majestic and awe-inspiring.<br>The spirit formation gate seemed to be indicating to the people that they would enter a completely different world should they step past the gate.<br>This would be the first time that Chu Feng and the others would pass through this spirit formation gate.<br>However, after they passed through the spirit formation gate, what appeared before their eyes was not what Chu Feng had anticipated at all.<br>Chu Feng had thought that there would be a paradise-like land with dense natural energies that was filled with opportunities on the other side of the spirit formation gate.<br>However, the place where Chu Feng and the others found themselves was a spacious and empty palace hall.<br>The ceiling of that palace hall was filled with stars. The many palace pillars penetrated through the starry sky.<br>Some people were already gathered inside the palace. Judging from their title plates, Chu Feng was able to determine that, apart from their Chu Heavenly Clan and the Dongguo Heavenly Clan, there were seven other powers present.<br>Chu Feng felt that they should all be powers from the Eastern Region that would be participating in the Overlord Region&rsquo;s Celebration of the New Excellence.<br>It should be mentioned that located deep inside the palace hall were nineteen spirit formation gates.<br>Before those spirit formation gates sat two individuals, a man and a woman.<br>The two of them had the same title plates on their waists. On their title plates were the words &lsquo;Linghu Heavenly Clan.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;The ruler of the Overlord Region.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed as he saw the title plates on the man and woman&rsquo;s waists.<br>Chu Feng had already heard before that the strong and enormous powers of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm had all entered the Overlord Region.<br>As for the strongest power within the Overlord Region, they were called the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>The Linghu Heavenly Clan was the current ruler of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s Overlord Region.<br></p></div>
