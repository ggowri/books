        <div>: Yunliang&rsquo;s Determination<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After returning to Lord Yunliang&rsquo;s own sleeping chamber, Lord Yunliang told Chu Feng to rest while he headed to another room by himself, presumably to recuperate from his exertion too.<br>It was only till nighttime that Lord Yunliang came to visit Chu Feng again. Even though Lord Yunliang appeared to still be in a feeble state, he was doing much better than earlier.<br>He brought Chu Feng to the Asura King Palace once more.<br>The Asura King Palace was still as tightly guarded as ever, but as Lord Yunliang had the token of the Asura King in hand, the guards quickly opened the way to him.<br>However, compared to when they came during daytime, Chu Feng could sense that Lord Yunliang was in much more of a hurry than before.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, is the box still there?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still there, The Asura King didn&rsquo;t take it away with him,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>Chu Feng had fused a formation into the box. While it didn&rsquo;t allow him to peer into the content of the box, after entering the Asura King Palace, he was still able to sense its exact location through the formation.<br>It was still at the King&rsquo;s Stand right now, but the Asura King had already taken his leave.<br>&ldquo;The old man surely can&rsquo;t be planning to bring you in just like that and have you take the box out, is he? If so, what&rsquo;s he planning to do? He&rsquo;s an Asura Evil Spirit after all, he can&rsquo;t just escape from the Asura Graveyard with you,&rdquo; Milady Queen remarked in incomprehension.<br>Chu Feng shared the same doubts as well.<br>One must know that the guards had witnessed Lord Yunliang&rsquo;s entry, so he would be the first one to be doubted if anything happened. He had no idea why Lord Yunliang was taking the risk to help him acquire the box.<br>Soon, they returned to the very depths of the Asura King Palace.<br>There was a golden box of around dozens of meters wide sitting on the King&rsquo;s Stand. There was a formation cast on the golden box, and this formation was currently active, absorbing the unique energy on the King&rsquo;s Stand.<br>This golden box was different from the sealed box Chu Feng had seen earlier in the day, but he knew that the sealed box was located right inside this golden box.<br>&ldquo;Brat, activate your formation and open this box,&rdquo; Lord Yunliang ordered.<br>Chu Feng quickly did as he was told.<br>He quickly activated the formation and used it to open up the box.<br>While the formation on the golden box was complicated, it was a formation used to nourish the box that had been sealed off, so its defenses were far weaker. It took only half an incense&rsquo;s time for Chu Feng to open it up.<br>Once the golden box was opened, the sealed box appeared before Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;Brat, take it away with you,&rdquo; Lord Yunliang said.<br>Chu Feng quickly did as he was told and stowed the sealed box away.<br>&ldquo;Swallow this and return back the way where you came from.&rdquo;<br>Lord Yunliang took out a pill and passed it over to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng could tell that it was a pill that allowed him to conceal himself from view. Its ability to conceal presences was far superior to his Nine Dragons Saint Cloak and his concealment formations.<br>In fact, even a world spiritist of the level of the Wretched Black Demon probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able to forge such a pill. Without a doubt, this pill was forged by an incredibly formidable world spiritist.<br>Lord Yunliang was taking a special precaution so as to ensure that Chu Feng could get away safely.<br>Without daring to hesitate at all, Chu Feng quickly swallowed the pill.<br>As expected, once the pill was swallowed, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body swiftly turned invisible.<br>The effect of the pill was extremely potent, such that even the Asura God King would struggle to sense him now.<br>&ldquo;Brat, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Lord Yunliang asked.<br>Surprisingly, his tone had gotten much softer than before.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I&rsquo;m Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied honestly.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng&hellip; Tell the Wretched Black Demon to not let down our Asura World Spirit Army,&rdquo; Lord Yunliang said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Yunliang, are you really not planning on leaving?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>One must know that Lord Yunliang would most definitely die if he didn&rsquo;t escape right now. The sealed box was indubitably very important to the Asura Evil Spirits, so they wouldn&rsquo;t let off the culprit who dared to steal it from their hands.<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave. You should hurry up and go. The pill&rsquo;s effect only lasts for a short while, so you must make haste,&rdquo; Lord Yunliang said.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I&rsquo;ll remember the help you have offered me. I hope that we can meet one another again.&rdquo;<br>That was just an unrealistic hope from Chu Feng. He knew deep down that it was unlikely that they would ever meet one another ever again, and that made him feel a little bitter on the inside.<br>Regardless of what kind of person Lord Yunliang was and how many bad deeds he had done in the past, at the very least, he hadn&rsquo;t done anything bad to Chu Feng thus far. Instead, he even helped him save Wang Yuxian.<br>Yet, he had chosen to stay here and await his own death.<br>This really confused Chu Feng. Given Lord Yunliang&rsquo;s high standing in the Asura Graveyard, why was he putting his own life on the line to help the Wretched Black Demon?<br>However, there was no time for Chu Feng to be thinking too much in the matter or grief about it. He knew that he had to leave right away, or else once the pill&rsquo;s effect wore off, his own concealment means might not necessarily be able to escape from the sharp senses of someone as powerful as the Asura King.<br>So, he quickly bowed to Lord Yunliang before hurrying away.<br>However, barely after Chu Feng left the Asura King Palace, he saw the Asura King leading a group of experts and the army of the Asura Evil Spirits into the Asura King Palace.<br>&ldquo;That old man probably won&rsquo;t be able to survive this ordeal&hellip; Haa, this really puts me in a bad mood. Chu Feng, you should hurry up and leave. That old man named Yunliang sacrificed his life so that you can obtain this box. You mustn&rsquo;t let him down,&rdquo; Milady Queen said.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t slow down despite seeing the Asura King and the others. He continued making his way toward the hall which he had come from when he first arrived. That place was located in quite a remote location in the Asura Graveyard, so it was quite far away from the Asura King Palace.<br>So, before he could reach the hall, the effect of the pill had already begun fading.<br>Lord Yunliang wasn&rsquo;t lying to him. As potent as the pill was, its duration was limited.<br>So, Chu Feng could only use his Nine Dragons Saint Cloak and his own concealment formation to hide.<br>Fortunately, he didn&rsquo;t encounter any top experts of the Asura Evil Spirits along the way, so he wasn&rsquo;t too worried about getting discovered.<br>&hellip;<br>Meanwhile, in the Asura King Palace, the Asura King, together with his huge army, had already arrived at the King&rsquo;s Stand.<br>Lord Yunliang was still standing on the spot at this very moment.<br>Despite seeing the Asura King, he showed no fear on his face at all. He had already resolved himself.<br>&ldquo;Yunliang, is this your doing?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the opened golden box, the faces of the Asura Evil Spirits immediately warped in anger as killing intent poured out from them.<br>The Asura King raised his hand to silence everyone. Then, he descended down to where Lord Yunliang was.<br>&ldquo;Yunliang, hand it over. Don&rsquo;t force me to make my move,&rdquo; the Asura King said.<br>&ldquo;My king, it&rsquo;s already no longer here,&rdquo; Lord Yunliang said.<br>&ldquo;It must be that brat following Yunliang earlier. He must be the one who took it. Men, find him and bring him here!&rdquo; the Asura King shouted.<br>&ldquo;My king, Yunliang&rsquo;s guard has never left this place. He must still be in the palace,&rdquo; the guards in charge of looking after the Asura King Palace reported.<br>&ldquo;Inside the palace? He&rsquo;s already no longer here! Useless trash, you can&rsquo;t even guard the palace properly!&rdquo;<br>One of the high-ranking evil spirits walked up to the guard and slapped his face. The guard felt indignant, but he dared not to utter a word of complaint.<br>Meanwhile, the other evil spirits also began searching for Chu Feng&rsquo;s whereabouts, but they couldn&rsquo;t find him as well. If he was really still in the Asura King Palace, they should have already found him by now.<br>And if he had the means to conceal from them, he would have already long escaped from there. There was no need for him to continue hiding here.<br>This realization made the Asura Evil Spirits sweat profusely.<br>Shoosh!<br>It was then that the Asura King reached out to grab Lord Yunliang by this throat. Black aura shot out from his palm like worms and wiggled into Lord Yunliang&rsquo;s body.<br>Lord Yunliang tried his best to bear with it, but his body still began to tremble as pain surfaced on his face.<br>&ldquo;Speak! Where did that brat go?&rdquo; the Asura King ordered authoritatively.<br>&ldquo;I already told you. He has already left,&rdquo; Lord Yunliang answered.<br>&ldquo;Look for him! No matter the means, find him and bring him before me!&rdquo; the Asura King ordered loudly.<br>All of the evil spirits present immediately dashed out of the Asura King Palace to search for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Hahahahaha!&rdquo;<br>It was then that Lord Yunliang began laughing hysterically.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless. Like I told you, he has already left. Even if you search through the entire barracks of the Asura World Spirit Army, you won&rsquo;t be able to find him. It&rsquo;s im&hellip;&rdquo; Lord Yunliang laughed mockingly.<br>Uwa!<br>But before he could speak a word, a guttural cry escaped from him.<br>The Asura King had pierced through his throat.<br>&ldquo;Yunliang, you have really disappointed the trust I have shown in you. Do you know that your actions are not only a betrayal to the Asura World Spirit Army, it&rsquo;s also condemning them to eternal hell?&rdquo; the Asura King spat with gritted teeth.<br>&ldquo;My king, I have never betrayed the Asura World Spirit Army. The one who has done wrong is you,&rdquo; Lord Yunliang said.<br>&ldquo;Yunliang, I&rsquo;ve already given you a chance.&rdquo;<br>With a feral look on his face, the Asura King stabbed his hand forward and pierced right through Lord Yunliang&rsquo;s body.<br>&hellip;<br>After rushing a distance away, Chu Feng finally returned back to the hall which he first came from.<br>Despite its divine appearance, it was remote and unguarded. He was able to enter the premises without any difficulty, and he found the spirit formation gate that led him out of the Asura Graveyard too.<br>However, instead of leaving right away, he brought Gongsun Yuntian out.<br></p></div>
