        <div> - Mastermind<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Sure enough!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng started to frown.<br>At the same time, the expressions of worry and astonishment on Ying Mingchao and the others&rsquo; faces also grew stronger.<br>The scene earlier had allowed them to know that there was indeed a mastermind behind the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>As for the mastermind, he was most definitely an extremely powerful individual, so powerful that they simply could not contend against him.<br>Furthermore, that person was present. It was very likely that that person would attack Chu Feng and the others.<br>That said, as matters stood, there was already no choice left for Chu Feng.<br>He was making a gamble. He was gambling on that individual not daring to show himself and attacking them.<br>The reason why Chu Feng dared to make such a gamble was because he felt that if that individual was capable of doing things himself, he would definitely not have gone through the effort to have the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster help him.<br>Thus, he most definitely possessed some sort of reason that made it so that he was unable to handle things personally.<br>&ldquo;Quickly, run away! Run away!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the people from the Infant Soul Sect started to flee in disarray.<br>When even their strongest Sectmaster was killed, if they were to continue stay there, they would only be waiting for death.<br>As Chu Feng saw the escaping members of the Infant Soul Sect, coldness gleamed in his eyes.<br>Chu Feng started to recall the infants that had died miserably. Those people that were currently fleeing were the culprits that had slaughtered infants.<br>With a thought, Chu Feng&rsquo;s oppressive might began to move toward the fleeing members of the Infant Soul Sect in a manner capable of toppling mountains and overturning seas.<br>&ldquo;Bang, bang, bang, bang~~~&rdquo;<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...<br>At that moment, muffled explosions began to be heard nonstop in the air like firecrackers.<br>Following each muffled explosion, a person from the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s body and soul would be blown up.<br>In merely a split second, all the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s members were killed. Like rain, their blood began to sprinkle down from the sky.<br>It was a truly devastating scene. However, not a single person from the allied army felt any sympathy for them when they saw this. Even people like Grandmaster Pocket, people that possessed a kind and merciful heart, did not feel any sympathy.<br>They all knew very well that the people from the Infant Soul Sect had done countless evils, and that their deaths could not wipe away their sins.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, that grand formation is still here,&rdquo; right at that moment, Her Lady Queen called Chu Feng&rsquo;s attention to the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s grand formation.<br>Actually, Chu Feng had noticed it even without Her Lady Queen telling him about it. That grand formation condensed by the crowd from the Infant Soul Sect was still present in the sky, and covering the entire region.<br>Logically, as the people who had set up that formation had already been killed, the grand formation should have dissipated. After all, it was a grand formation created by the special powers that the people from the Infant Soul Sect possessed, and not a spirit formation.<br>That said, it was precisely because that grand formation that should have dissipated had yet to dissipate that it was strange.<br>&ldquo;This grand formation is too dangerous. We can&rsquo;t stay here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng said those words, he swept the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword across the sky with a single thought, and severed all the dark black gaseous flames that served as the connections that Infant Soul Grand Formation had with the hundreds of millions of lives below.<br>The next moment, the crowd that was originally covered by the dark black gaseous flames finally managed to escape.<br>However, it was only when they escaped from the black gaseous flames that the crowd discovered that over half of the people had already died.<br>All those with weak levels of cultivation were already dead. All those who were still alive possessed relatively decent levels of cultivation.<br>That said, even all those that were still alive were left in a completely shriveled state of skin and bones. Regardless of what their ages were, they were all filled with wrinkles, and all of their hair had fallen out. They were incomparably aged.<br>Every one of them resembled corpses that had walked out from their coffins. Their appearances were extremely frightening.<br>It could be seen that they had not just had their souls extracted. This time around, they had paid an enormous price for their ignorance and greed.<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a shocking scene occurred. All the people who were still alive, regardless of their gender and status, all knelt on the ground and began to bow to Chu Feng with both hands held in front of them.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, we were foolish. Thank you for saving us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, we were wrong. We wrongly accused you all. We deserve to die ten thousand times for our crimes.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the people kneeling on the ground, regardless of their age and gender, were all wailing and crying tears of remorse.<br>Chu Feng noticed that even the Abbot of the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple and the Headmaster of the Immortal Sword School were among them. Although they were not kowtowing with their hands before them like the others, their faces were also covered with tears of remorse.<br>From this, it could be seen that even though they were trapped, they had managed to hear everything that had happened earlier, hear the entire conversation between Chu Feng and the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>They now all knew that they&rsquo;d fallen for the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s plot, and that Ying Mingchao and the others were right.<br>Upon thinking about what they&rsquo;d done, they felt endlessly ashamed.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to thank me. I did not come here to save you all. Your lives and deaths are unrelated to me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said coldly. He was completely unmoved by the thanks from the crowd.<br>In fact, Chu Feng did not even bother to take a look at them. Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes have been fixed onto the sky. He was staring at the surging Infant Soul Grand Formation.<br>That grand formation was much more complicated than Chu Feng had imagined it to be. Chu Feng felt that as long as the Infant Soul Grand Formation remained, they would still be in danger.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I have truly underestimated you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, you are still unable to change anything.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice suddenly sounded from above the Infant Soul Grand Formation.<br>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo;<br>Hearing that voice, the crowd present all grew nervous. Some people even started to involuntarily shiver in fear.<br>As matters stood, they all knew that someone was instructing the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster from behind. As for that person&hellip; since he was capable of manipulating the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster, he was most definitely an exceptionally powerful existence.<br>As for that voice, it was very possible for it to be that individual&rsquo;s voice.<br>Since that voice was heard, it meant that individual was most definitely planning to act.<br>If that individual were to act, who could possibly stop him? Even Chu Feng would likely not be a match for him.<br>With the situation being as it was, how could the crowd not be scared?<br>&ldquo;Run away!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, someone shouted.<br>It was unknown who shouted the first cry to run away. However, immediately after that shout was heard, the crowd that was kneeling on the ground immediately stood up.<br>They began to soar into the sky, run on the ground and even dig into the earth. They were using all of their powers and all of their abilities to escape far away from that place.<br>&ldquo;That bunch of craven and cowardly trash,&rdquo; Seeing such a scene, Zhao Hong felt disgust from the bottom of her heart.<br>It was no wonder Chu Feng did not appreciate the thanks from those people. Those people were simply too selfish.<br>&ldquo;That voice earlier?&rdquo;<br>At the moment when that voice sounded, Chu Huai revealed an expression of disbelief.<br>He then looked to Chu Yue, and discovered that she too had the same sort of expression of disbelief in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Chu Huai, am I mistaking things? That voice earlier seemed to be Senior Chu Bore&rsquo;s voice,&rdquo; Chu Yue said to Chu Huai.<br>[1. Bore is the chinese translation of the sanskrit word<br>praj&ntilde;a meaning wisdom.]<br>She was unwilling to believe this, for that voice was their senior&rsquo;s voice.<br>However, if it really was their senior Chu Bore&rsquo;s voice, it would mean that the mastermind manipulating the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was Chu Bore.<br>&ldquo;I am also uncertain,&rdquo; Chu Huai shook his head. Actually, it wasn&rsquo;t that he was uncertain. Rather, he did not dare to make a judgment.<br>The reason for that was because this matter was of major significance.<br>Chu Bore was the person in charge of overseeing the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. His task was to determine whether they had accomplished their missions with their own power. Apart from that, he should not involve himself in anything in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>However, if Chu Bore was truly the mastermind behind the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster, then he would truly have committed an enormous taboo.<br>His action was an extremely serious crime. Furthermore, he was ordering the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster to murder hundreds of millions of people, something extremely inhumane.<br>This was simply commiting a crime on top of his original crime. His crimes would absolutely not be forgiven.<br>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s impossible. Senior Chu wouldn&rsquo;t do that sort of thing,&rdquo; Chu Yue said.<br>&ldquo;Tsk, tsk, tsk&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Right after Chu Yue finished saying those words, a cold and sinister laugh sounded from the sky above the Infant Soul Grand Formation.<br>Soon, a figure slowly descended from the sky. It was an old man. He was emitting an incomparably powerful aura. That old man was descending from the sky like a god.<br>&ldquo;Huuu~~~&rdquo;<br>That old man waved his sleeve. Immediately, a burst of power surrounded the entire region. The people that had escaped far away were all dragged back by the invisible power.<br>The escaped crowd started to roll and crawl on the ground as they were dragged like a bunch of fallen leaves. They were once again gathered below the Infant Soul Grand Formation.<br>With merely a flip of his hand, that old man had managed to recapture all of the escapees.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>After that old man revealed his power, Ying Mingchao and the others all revealed dejected expressions whilst despair filled their faces.<br>The aura of that old man was simply too powerful. He was so powerful that they started to feel despair from the bottoms of their hearts.<br>An existence like him was someone that they would never be able to contend against.<br>Before that old man, they were like ants. A single movement from that old man would be able to easily obliterate them.<br>&ldquo;It really is senior?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Yue was incomparably shocked.<br>The reason for that was because that old man was precisely their senior, the old man by the name of Chu Bore.<br><br></p></div>
