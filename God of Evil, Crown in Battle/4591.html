        <h1>Chapter 4590</h1>
        <div>: It&rsquo;s Only a Matter of Time Before the Sky Changes<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Nine Souls Sacred Clan was the overlord of the Nine Souls Galaxy, so it was no wonder that the top brass of the Holy Light Galaxy had heard of their reputation.<br>To summarize, it was a power that the Holy Light Clan absolutely couldn&rsquo;t afford to offend.<br>&ldquo;To think that the Nine Souls Sacred Clan is here too! Does Chu Feng actually have such a background too?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is too unbelievable! Isn&rsquo;t he from our Holy Light Galaxy? Why would the Nine Souls Sacred Clan stand up for him?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was flabbergasted. Despite having seen all sorts of storms, the turn of events that was happening right before their eyes took away their composure.<br>Even a flicker of astonishment had appeared in Song Yun&rsquo;s clear eyes when she saw the arrival of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s army.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect big brother Chu Feng to have such connections. Amazing.&rdquo;<br>After recovering from her astonishment, Song Yun&rsquo;s lips curled into a sweet smile.<br>There were also several groups of people amidst this massive crowd that wasn&rsquo;t too surprised by the sight before them. They were those from the Monstrous Herd Temple and the Yu Heavenly Clan.<br>They had already found out about the close relation Chu Feng had with a princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan during their short journey to the Nine Souls Galaxy.<br>In truth, they had thought of reminding the Holy Light Clan about Chu Feng&rsquo;s background so that they wouldn&rsquo;t go too far. However, they eventually decided against it due to their understanding of Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s character.<br>Even if they had informed Shengguang Xuanye out of goodwill, the latter was likely to think that they were trying to threaten him and view them in enmity.<br>They might be behemoths in the Holy Light Galaxy, but they wouldn&rsquo;t dare to make enemies out of the Holy Light Clan. There were simply far too many ways the Holy Light Clan could deal with them, including harming their juniors and those who were helpless to protect themselves.<br>Weighing the pros and cons, they eventually chose not to get involved in the matter.<br>Nevertheless, they did bear hopes about the interference of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that they would really come.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Looks like young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s name will rattle the whole Holy Light Galaxy today.&rdquo;<br>The Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster and the others thought to themselves.<br>Chu Feng might have made his name by winning the tournament held by the Holy Light Clan, but this time around, he was openly opposing the Holy Light Clan. Naturally, this would stir a commotion of far greater scale than before.<br>In their view, no matter how domineering Shengguang Xuanye might be, he wouldn&rsquo;t dare to snub the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. As such, it was likely that Chu Feng would be able to escape with his life today.<br>Before everyone&rsquo;s eyes, the army of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan traversed through the crowd to arrive right before the Holy Light Clan.<br>Innumerable war chariots and warships floated in a neat formation in the air, looming threateningly over the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s camp. The members of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan stood with arms in their hands, awaiting the orders of their leader.<br>It was almost as if they were waging war on the Holy Light Clan.<br>However, the fact that they hadn&rsquo;t made a move yet hinted that there could still be grounds for reconciliation.<br>Two figures, an old woman and a young woman, walked out from the warship stationed at the direct center of the formation.<br>The old woman had a skinny physique, and she wasn&rsquo;t too tall either. Her gray hair was combed to the back of her head, and her wrinkly face made her look extremely old. Even her back had bent under the weight of her age. It seemed like the only thing that was keeping her standing was the white jade cane in her hand.<br>Yet, the presence of this old woman brought a flicker of fear across the eyes of Shengguang Xuanye and Shengguang Yunyue.<br>The name of this old woman was Jiuhun Guizhi, and she was a Supreme Elder of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. Needless to say, she was an extremely powerful cultivator.<br>No one here, aside from Shengguang Xuanye, could possibly put up a fight against Jiuhun Guizhi.<br>However, as compared to Jiuhun Guizhi, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze was focused more on the young woman walking beside her.<br>This young woman had a uniquely beautiful appearance that surpassed even that of Song Yun&rsquo;s. She was the princess who had braved through life-and-death situations with Chu Feng back at the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, Xian Miaomiao.<br>Just that it would be more apt to address her as Jiuhun Miaomiao now.<br>Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s eyes were currently looking at Chu Feng too, and the latter&rsquo;s weakened appearance ignited blazing rage in her eyes. She released her overwhelming killing intent, and this killing intent was directed to Shengguang Xuanye and the elders beside him.<br>Pah!<br>But at this very moment, a wrinkled hand suddenly fell on Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s shoulder.<br>&ldquo;Miaomiao, leave this matter to me,&rdquo; Jiuhun Guizhi said.<br>Xian Miaomiao didn&rsquo;t say anything after hearing those words, but the retraction of her killing intent showed her decision. Nevertheless, the rage in her eyes still remained unabated.<br>&ldquo;Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, I shan&rsquo;t beat around the bush. Young friend Chu Feng over here is a close friend of our Princess Miaomiao. I don&rsquo;t care what crimes he has committed, but I must take him away with me today. May I know if you&rsquo;re willing to do us this favor?&rdquo; Jiuhun Guizhi asked with a smile.<br>Her words were polite, but her attitude was firm and left no room for negotiation.<br>This placed great pressure on all of the members of the Holy Light Clan present here. Even Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s complexion didn&rsquo;t look too good.<br>It was mere moments ago that he ordered Chu Feng&rsquo;s execution. If he were to release the latter right now, what would become of his honor?<br>However, the people he was dealing with over here were the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, and he knew just how powerful they were. Even though they were both overlords in their respective galaxies, he had neither the strength nor influence to really go against them.<br>If he were to offend the Nine Souls Sacred Clan over here, it was almost guaranteed that the Holy Light Clan would suffer in the future.<br>Thus, after some consideration, Shengguang Xuanye said, &ldquo;This man has killed my clan member and ought to have been killed. However, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan has once done our Holy Light Clan a favor, and we owe you one. Not to mention, Elder Guizhi has even come by personally to make this request of us. It&rsquo;s only right for us to do you this favor.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s words brought a jolt to the listening crowd all around. While they had expected Shengguang Xuanye to make such a decision, they still couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a little conflicted by this.<br>At this moment, everyone turned their eyes to look at Chu Feng. They were starting to get a vague idea as to why the Holy Light Clan viewed Chu Feng as a threat.<br>Putting Chu Feng&rsquo;s incredible talents aside, his background was much more intimidating. There was no way the Holy Light Clan could have turned a blind eye to him!<br>As long as this man existed, it was only a matter of time before the Holy Light Galaxy changed hands!<br></p></div>
