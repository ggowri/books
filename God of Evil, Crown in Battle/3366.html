        <div> - The Threat To The Starfield Master Realm<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;That said, big sister, that animal is actually that difficult to refine?&rdquo; Soon, Chu Feng revealed a worried look.<br>The black silhouette was able to suppress Bai Liluo&rsquo;s consciousness before, and gained control over her body to poison the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and plot against Chu Feng.<br>This meant that the black silhouette was very difficult to handle.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, what happened back then was because of my carelessness.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, this time around, I&rsquo;ve completely suppressed that animal. Refining it is only a matter of time now. It no longer has any chance to turn the situation around.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That being said, big sister actually has to thank you,&rdquo; Bai Liluo said.<br>&ldquo;Thank me?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt confused.<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t because I wanted to cleanse the injustice that you&rsquo;d received, I wouldn&rsquo;t have exploded with such power to suppress that animal. Thus, I will naturally have to thank you,&rdquo; Bai Liluo said.<br>Chu Feng felt a warmth in his heart upon hearing those words.<br>Bai Liluo&rsquo;s words revealed to him how much she valued him.<br>For someone with her personality to treat him like that, it was sufficient to prove that Bai Liluo regarded him as her own close relative.<br>After making their decision, Chu Feng and Bai Liluo immediately began to proceed toward the Wuma Heavenly Clan. Chu Feng did not bother to give prior notice to Chu Xuanzhengfa. If he were to mention it to him, he<br>would<br>definitely stop him. As such, Chu Feng only left a letter for him before he left.<br>However, the contents of the letter only said that he had something that he must do, and that he had left to do it. He did not explain what he had gone to do.<br>Although the sight of Chu Feng and Bai Liluo leaving was not captured by the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, that did not mean that no one noticed them leaving.<br>At that moment, there were several figures hidden within the void near the border of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>They were people from the Starfield Master Realm. Not only was Wuming Gangxiong present, but Wuming Fenghuo was also present.<br>Looking at the direction that Chu Feng and Bai Liluo had disappeared in, a ruthless expression flashed through Wuming Gangxiong&rsquo;s eyes. He said, &ldquo;Lord Fenghuo, with the father being a lion, the son cannot possibly become a dog. That Chu Feng is definitely not someone who will be easy to deal with in the future. Shouldn&rsquo;t we seize this opportunity to eliminate him so as to prevent future troubles?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eliminate him? Have you gone mad?&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo revealed a displeased expression upon hearing those words. He glared fiercely at Wuming Gangxiong, and then waved his hand to indicate to the others to withdraw.<br>When the other people from the Starfield Master Realm left, only Wuming Gangxiong and Wuming Fenghuo remained.<br>&ldquo;Milord, did this subordinate say something wrong?&rdquo; Wuming Gangxiong was much older than Wuming Fenghuo. However, he was extremely submissive toward him.<br>He was deeply afraid that he had said something wrong, and offended Wuming Fenghuo.<br>&ldquo;If we are to kill Chu Feng, how could Chu Xuanyuan possibly let it pass?&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo asked.<br>&ldquo;Milord, back then, that Chu Xuanyuan was no match for our clan. And now, he has been imprisoned in the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s forbidden area for many years. His cultivation has already declined, turning him into a cripple. Is there still a need to fear him?&rdquo; Wuming Gangxiong asked.<br>&ldquo;A shriveled camel is still larger than a horse. That holds even more true since Chu Xuanyuan is still alive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, there is one thing that you still do not know. It is time that I let you know about it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, our clan has been secretly monitoring the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s forbidden area that Chu Xuanyuan has been imprisoned in all these years. From time to time, we would dispatch people there to secretly survey Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s activities.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A couple years ago, Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s cultivation still appeared to have declined.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s forbidden area that Chu Xuanyuan was imprisoned in has been sealed away now. The sealing formation is extremely powerful. Even with the six great lords working together, they were unable to breach the formation. From this, one can imagine how powerful that sealing formation is,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo said.<br>&ldquo;Milord, in that case, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s cultivation has not declined at all? Instead, it has increased?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Wuming Gangxiong revealed a look of panic.<br>The six great lords that Wuming Fenghuo mentioned were all Utmost Exalted-level experts. With the six of them working together, they still failed to breach the sealing formation. From that, one could imagine how powerful the sealing formation was.<br>&ldquo;We have likely been duped by Chu Xuanyuan. That forbidden area has simply not caused his cultivation to decline. Furthermore, the six great lords suspect that Chu Xuanyuan has already left the forbidden area.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That man has returned with his son,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo said.<br>&ldquo;Returned?&rdquo;<br>Hearing the word &lsquo;returned,&rsquo; Wuming Gangxiong&rsquo;s body started to shiver involuntarily. At that precise moment, all of the hair on his body stood on end.<br>&ldquo;Why else did you think I came to this Chu Heavenly Clan? I came precisely because I&rsquo;ve heard that Chu Feng has returned. That&rsquo;s why I came to check out exactly what sort of person that Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son is, and subsequently determine if Chu Xuanyuan himself has returned,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo said.<br>&ldquo;Milord, in that case, it would mean that we were truly duped by the Chu Heavenly Clan. That Chu Xuanyuan was simply not punished. Instead, he entered closed-door training?&rdquo; Wuming Gangxiong revealed a frightened expression in his eyes.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that he was a coward. Instead, it was because he knew very well what the name of Chu Xuanyuan represented.<br>Chu Xuanyuan was a very terrifying man.<br>Perhaps the terrifying nature of Chu Xuanyuan was something that the others from the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm had, only heard about and did not understand clearly.<br>However, Wuming Gangxiong knew very well how terrifying Chu Xuanyuan was.<br>It was precisely because they knew how terrifying Chu Xuanyuan was that the Starfield Master Realm viewed him as a thorn in their side.<br>&ldquo;We can practically determine with certainty that we have been duped,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo said.<br>&ldquo;That despicable bastard. If we had known such a thing was going to happen, we would&rsquo;ve never given him the chance back then, we should&rsquo;ve directly eliminated him,&rdquo; Wuming Gangxiong said.<br>&ldquo;Do you think Lord Fieldmaster did not want to eliminate him back then?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although Lord Fieldmaster won the battle back then, he only barely won. Furthermore, Lord Fieldmaster felt that Chu Xuanyuan was still holding back, and did not use all of his abilities. Although he did not know what other abilities Chu Xuanyuan possessed, Lord Fieldmaster felt a restraining fear toward Chu Xuanyuan because of it,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, it would mean that it wasn&rsquo;t Lord Fieldmaster who spared Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s life. Instead, he was unable to eliminate Chu Xuanyuan even if he wanted to?&rdquo; Shock filled Wuming Gangxiong&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo nodded.<br>&ldquo;Milord, if Lord Fieldmaster is already unable to eliminate the Chu Xuanyuan from back then, then, with the current Chu Xuanyuan, wouldn't it mean that we&hellip;?&rdquo; The more Wuming Gangxiong thought about the matter, the more afraid he became.<br>&ldquo;Back then, although we were monitoring the Chu Heavenly Clan, viewed Chu Xuanyuan as a threat, and thought about eliminating him, we had not really openly become Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s enemy. Lord Fieldmaster had left leeway to turn the matter around.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, if we had gone to extremes back then, with Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s personality, he would&rsquo;ve definitely attacked us already.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since Chu Xuanyuan did not attack us, it means that&hellip; he has not taken to heart what happened back then,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo said.<br>&ldquo;Not taken to heart?&rdquo; Wuming Gangxiong did not agree with Wuming Fenghuo. He clearly remembered Chu Xuanyuan being someone who<br>would<br>definitely take his revenge.<br>&ldquo;Milord, could we be overthinking things? Could that defensive formation only be a defensive measure from Chu Xuanyuan? Perhaps it&rsquo;s something that he unleashed through the use of some sort of treasure?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for why he released that defensive formation, he did so precisely so that we would think that he had become stronger, and become afraid of him, and not dare to attack his son?&rdquo; Wuming Gangxiong voiced his guess.<br>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;ve said is also possible. However, I feel that possibility to be very small,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo said.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that we have not managed to eliminate the threat that is Chu Xuanyuan,&rdquo; Wuming Gangxiong sighed.<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanyuan is a threat, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it. Regardless of whether it&rsquo;s back then or now, he is still a threat that we cannot overlook.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the actual threat to our Starfield Master Realm right now is not Chu Xuanyuan. Instead, it&rsquo;s the Linghu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo said.<br>Hearing the words &lsquo;Linghu Heavenly Clan,&rsquo; Wuming Fenghuo started to frown. The worried expression on his face grew even more intense.<br>As someone from the Starfield Master Realm, how could he not know about the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s ambition?<br>What caused him the greatest worry was the fact that the Linghu Heavenly Clan had already gained sufficient strength. Even though their Starfield Master Realm had discovered the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s ambition, it was already too late.<br>Their Starfield Master Realm was destined to battle the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>What Wuming Fenghuo said was very correct. There was still leeway to turn the situation between them and Chu Xuanyuan around.<br>However, against the Linghu Heavenly Clan, there was no leeway to turn things around.<br>War between them was unavoidable.<br>Even if they, the Starfield Master Realm, wanted to avoid it, the Linghu Heavenly Clan would not allow it.<br></p></div>
