        <h1>Chapter 5667: Conqueror Steles</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It was a partnership, elder. You don&rsquo;t owe me anything at all,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you refuting me right now? I&rsquo;m saying that I owe you a debt, and that&rsquo;s it. Stop arguing with me. Don&rsquo;t you know better than to argue with a woman?&rdquo; Xia Xingchen replied with a coercive tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not harp on this matter. Give me your wrist,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he grabbed Xia Xingchen&rsquo;s wrist, wondering if he could free her from the threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you able to get it out?&rdquo; Xia Xingchen asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng examined her wrist before giving his verdict, &ldquo;My cultivation level isn&rsquo;t high enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The treasure was a tricky one to deal with. Other cultivators would have to have to absolutely overpower the treasure to take it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was in a better position since the treasure had acknowledged his father as its master, allowing him to retrieve it without having to overpower the treasure. Nevertheless, he still needed to reach at least True God level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you call your father here?&rdquo; Xia Xingchen asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, I don&rsquo;t know where my father is,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I should have known. Those small fries wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to bully you if he was by your side,&rdquo; Xia Xingchen remarked as she pulled her hand out of Chu Feng&rsquo;s grasp. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. This item doesn&rsquo;t pose a threat to me as long as your father doesn&rsquo;t trigger it.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, how strong was my father when you last met him?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why are you asking me that? You can ask your father yourself when you meet him. It can&rsquo;t be that you aren&rsquo;t on close terms with your father, are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I rarely meet my father.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;No wonder you&rsquo;re curious about him! I&rsquo;m also dying to know how strong your father is right now, but I reckon you don&rsquo;t know that either, right?&rdquo; Xia Xingchen asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with an awkward smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether your father is brave or foolish to not keep his outstanding son by his side.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;My father has his own plans.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re protecting him even though he abandoned you? You sure are a filial child.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xia Xingchen appeared to be a person who often smiled, but the smile she showed now was different from the one when they first met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, why did you leave the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you getting curious about me now?&rdquo; Xia Xingchen returned a question of her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just concerned about you. We did brave through a life-and-death situation together, right? However, I won&rsquo;t probe further if you don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing much. That old man from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect has set his eyes on me. You know how important juniors are to the God&rsquo;s Era, right? That old man&rsquo;s offspring are all trash, so he wanted me to bear his child in hopes he might get </span><span>someone with good talent. He was also the one who told me that the Heavenly Dome Immortal Method we&rsquo;re cultivating is incomplete. He said that he&rsquo;d impart the complete method to me as long as I marry him,&rdquo; Xia Xingchen said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you talking about the Heavenly Done Immortal sect&rsquo;s </span><span>sectmaster</span><span>?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Who else would dare do this?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Rest </span><span>assured,</span><span> I&rsquo;ll keep it a secret. Elder, could it be that you have someone in your heart if even the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>sectmaster</span><span> doesn&rsquo;t catch your interest?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Not at all. No one has moved my heart before.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Really? No one has ever moved your heart before?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that normal? Have you had a crush on someone before?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Seriously? A brat like you is in love with someone?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not young either. I&rsquo;d be a senior if I wasn&rsquo;t a cultivator. Most mortals at my age would have had quite a few children. Those who married earlier might even have grandchildren,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That makes sense. You might be a brat as a cultivator, but you&rsquo;d indeed be considered a senior going by mortals&rsquo; decades-long lifespan. Why don&rsquo;t you tell me how it feels like to be in love then?&rdquo; Xia Xingchen asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d cherish the person who moves my heart a lot. Her happiness brings me happiness. Thinking about her would bring a smile to my face. I&rsquo;d find myself missing her a lot when she isn&rsquo;t around. Parting ways from her is always tough; I&rsquo;d feel a strong reluctance in my heart, and I&rsquo;d rack my brain to find ways for us to stay together if it&rsquo;s possible to do so. It&rsquo;s different from parting ways with a friend,&rdquo; Chu Feng explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is that what it means to fall for someone?&rdquo; Xia Xingchen asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Only someone whom I&rsquo;m in love with can affect me so much. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the same for the others, but that&rsquo;s the case for me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t think I have ever been in love with anyone before.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, someone as outstanding as you </span><span>is</span><span> bound to carry high expectations of your partner. However, you don&rsquo;t need to worry. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before you meet someone who catches your eye,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Worry, my ass! I don&rsquo;t care for that!&rdquo; Xia Xingchen exclaimed before dragging Chu Feng out. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave this place first before we continue our conversation.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were out of the stone hall, she turned to Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Is there anywhere you wish to head to? If not, why don&rsquo;t you come with me?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Where are you headed to?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m finally free now, so I&rsquo;ll head wherever my heart will.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to decline your offer as I still have matters to attend to. I&rsquo;d be happy to accompany you on your journey if an opportunity arises in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You have offended the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect, and your father isn&rsquo;t with you. It&rsquo;ll be safer for you to come with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Will they put me on their wanted list?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d do so openly out of consideration for their reputation, but they&rsquo;ll definitely send assassins after you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I have had people coming for my life from a young age. It feels a little weird not to have others on my back.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You sure are a stubborn brat! Fine, we&rsquo;ll bid farewell here then.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;See you, elder.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;See you,&rdquo; Xia Xingchen replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rose into the air and took her leave. She was so fast that she put considerable distance between her and Chu Feng in the blink of an eye, but she halted all of a sudden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with this sour feeling in my heart?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perplexed, Xia Xingchen thought that she was injured, so she quickly consumed a pill and constructed a formation. However, the sour feeling refused to subside. She felt extremely uncomfortable as if she had just lost something important, and it put her in a low mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was perplexing, as everything had gone smoothly. She had grasped the complete Heavenly Dome Immortal Method, allowing her to raise her cultivation by three ranks despite being in True God level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anything, she should be celebrating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confused, she turned around and looked in the direction where she had just parted ways with Chu Feng. She thought about their earlier encounter, and that lifted her spirits a little. The corner of her lips even curled up a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she suddenly snapped out of it, and astonishment filled her eyes. &ldquo;Surely not! Could I have&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng pretended to leave the area, but he quickly returned to the stone hall and made his way toward the towering gate. He had to return to the Nine Heavens Secret Domain and complete the entrance examination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The towering gate was different from the one in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain, but it reacted when he constructed the corresponding key formation. His conjecture that it was teleportation formation was spot on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He entered the unbelievably fast teleportation passageway and returned to the Nine Heavens Secret Domain within two hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of returning to the towering gate, he found himself inside an ancient forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plants and trees inside this forest glowed with different colors, looking incredibly beautiful like a dreamscape. However, what caught his attention were three </span><span>steeles</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These </span><span>steeles</span><span> looked like pillars that connected the earth to the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first </span><span>steele</span><span> was covered with cracks, making it impossible to see what was written on it. The third </span><span>steele</span><span> had the words &lsquo;Conqueror Steele&rsquo; on it, but the area under it was empty. The second </span><span>steele</span><span> also had the words &lsquo;Conqueror Steele&rsquo; on it, but it had six names beneath it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first name was Qin Jiu.</span></p></div>
