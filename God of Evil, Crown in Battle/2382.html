        <div> - Disbelief<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Ahh~~~&rdquo;<br>A furious voice resonated. The surging aura seemed to be able to topple mountains and overturn the seas as it blasted through the trees.<br>Kong Zheng was unreconciled. He was still trying to lift the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. However&hellip; he had been unable to move the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone the entire time.<br>&ldquo;Even a Heavenly Bloodline possessor is unable to move that Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, that guy earlier, how did he manage to accomplish it?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd was certain that Kong Zheng would not be able to move the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. However, the more this was the case, the more astonished the crowd felt. They were astonished at how Chu Feng was able to move the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.<br>&ldquo;Someone was truly able to move this Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone earlier?&rdquo; After his efforts amounted to naught, Kong Zheng turned to question Zhou Zongzhi and the others.<br>&ldquo;Y-yes, i-it was indeed moved. Else, it would be impossible for it to give rise to the lightning strikes,&rdquo; Zhou Zongzhi said stuttering. Faced with Kong Zheng, he was feeling somewhat timid.<br>&ldquo;Impossible! Even I am unable to move this Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, how could someone possibly be able to move it?!&rdquo; Kong Zheng shouted loudly.<br>At that moment, he had a determined expression. It was as if what he had said was the truth. However, he was in fact feeling very diffident. The reason for that was if someone really had managed to accomplish what he had failed to do, it would truly be too humiliating for him. As for that, it was not a result that he wanted.<br>As for the people present, they were no fools. They were all able to tell that Kong Zheng was displeased. Thus, with the special status that Kong Zheng possessed, there would naturally be no one that dared to deny what Kong Zheng had declared to be true. Thus, even though they had seen Chu Feng moving the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone with their very eyes, no one dared to utter another word.<br>At that moment, it was absolutely quiet.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, an image suddenly shot out from the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. Immediately after, the image took actual form and became a person.<br>As for that person, it was none other than Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him! Lord Elders, Young Master Kong Zheng, that is the man who proclaimed to be from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm and moved the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He was the one who angered the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone and brought forth the wrath of Heaven, brought forth those frightening lightning strikes!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But&hellip; how&hellip; how&hellip; how is he still alive?!&rdquo;<br>Zhou Zongzhi and the others were incomparably shocked. Not mentioning whether or not Chu Feng was refined by the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, those two frightening lightning strikes had both entered the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone as well.<br>Logically, it should be impossible for Chu Feng to still be alive. Yet&hellip; not only was he safe and sound, he appeared to be even more spirited than before he had entered the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s actually you?!!!&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing Chu Feng, Kong Zheng&rsquo;s expression changed enormously. The reason for that was because this verified his guess that Chu Feng had entered the Hundred Refinements Stage.<br>&ldquo;He is that Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How did he enter this place?&rdquo; At that moment, Hu Xuanyi and the others were also extremely surprised.<br>&ldquo;You were the one who moved the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone earlier?&rdquo; Kong Zheng turned to ask Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. What about it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was standing less than three meters away from Kong Zheng. Although they were standing extremely close, Chu Feng did not place Kong Zheng in his eyes at all.<br>The reason for that was because the current Chu Feng was no longer the same as the Chu Feng from back then. Chu Feng had managed to withstand the second Divine Tribulation&rsquo;s lightning, and successfully reach two successive breakthroughs in cultivation, and was now at rank seven Half Martial Ancestor.<br>Back then, when Chu Feng was a rank five Half Martial Ancestor, when Chu Feng had a level of cultivation below Kong Zheng, he was barely able to injure Kong Zheng. And now, Chu Feng was a rank seven Half Martial Ancestor, a level of cultivation above Kong Zheng.<br>Even though Kong Zheng possessed a protective treasure, Chu Feng was confident in being able to completely defeat him.<br>&ldquo;I refuse to believe this. Even I am unable to move that Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. How could you possibly be able to move it?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Speak! Exactly what sort of despicable means did you use to move this Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, which in turn led to the lightning strikes, the wrath of Heaven?!&rdquo; Kong Zheng asked loudly, as if he were interrogating a prisoner.<br>&ldquo;Despicable means?&rdquo; Chu Feng snorted lightly. Then, he lowered his back, extended his right hand and effortlessly picked up the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. He said, &ldquo;Is this your so-called despicable means?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This guy, he...!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, not only were the bystanders astonished, even Kong Zheng moved back several steps and revealed an astonished expression.<br>The reason for that was because Kong Zheng knew very well how powerful that Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone was. He had exhausted all of his strength and used all his abilities, but had been unable to move the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone in the slightest.<br>Yet, Chu Feng had managed to lift the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone with one hand in such an effortless manner. With how enormous the disparity between them was, how could Kong Zheng not be astonished?<br>&ldquo;No, you must&rsquo;ve used some sort of demonic method. That&rsquo;s right&hellip; you&rsquo;re an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, you must have used some sort of special method. Else&hellip; how could you possibly be able to hold the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone in your hand?!&rdquo; Kong Zheng declared.<br>He was unable to accept that Chu Feng had accomplished what he was unable to accomplish. Thus, he thought of all sorts of means to provide a justification for himself, a means to reject Chu Feng&rsquo;s otherworldly ability.<br>&ldquo;Demonic method? Since I&rsquo;ve already used a demonic method, shouldn&rsquo;t you also be able to lift it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile.<br>Kong Zheng summoned up his courage and declared, &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; The way he saw it, since the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone had already been lifted by Chu Feng, the special magical power that the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone possessed should have disappeared. If he was to be asked to lift it, he should be able to lift it easily too.<br>&ldquo;Then give it a try,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he tossed the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone he held in his hand toward Kong Zheng.<br>Chu Feng was unable to be certain whether or not Kong Zheng would be able to lift the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone now. However, he was not afraid.<br>The reason for that was because even if Kong Zheng was able to lift up the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone now, Chu Feng possessed sufficient strength to snatch it back by force.<br>&ldquo;Truly foolish,&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng had actually really tossed the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone toward him, Kong Zheng was brimming with a mocking smile.<br>The way Kong Zheng saw it, if Chu Feng had not lifted the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, he, Kong Zheng, would not have been able to bring it away. Yet now, Chu Feng had helped him enormously.<br>&ldquo;Ouch!!!&rdquo;<br>However, the next moment, Kong Zheng let out a scream. The reason for that was because the moment his hands came in contact with the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, he was shocked to discover that the seemingly ordinary Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone had become incomparably heavy, so heavy that he was simply unable to withstand its weight.<br>Thus, not only did Kong Zheng fall to the ground, his hands were also crushed onto the altar by the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. He was unable to move in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;Heavens!!!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that scene, the crowd&rsquo;s expression changed once again. The reason for that was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s actions had once again signified how extraordinary the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone was.<br>At the same time, this also clearly proved how extraordinary Chu Feng was. Else&hellip; why would he be able to so easily lift the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone that others were unable to lift?<br>&ldquo;It seems that you are simply unable to lift the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. Thus&hellip; it&rsquo;s best that you stop boasting about your merits,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he lifted the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone and placed it into his Cosmos Sack.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?! How could that guy accomplish such a thing?!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the guardian clan&rsquo;s elders were all unable to contain themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.<br>Over the years, they had tried all kinds of methods to move the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. Among them was using a Cosmos Sack to directly absorb the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.<br>However, regardless of what method they used, it was useless.<br>At that time, the crowd felt that the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone was simply immovable. Or perhaps&hellip; only those with enormously powerful strength would be able to move it.<br>Yet now, they had personally seen Chu Feng lift the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone and place it into his Cosmos Sack. After seeing that, they realized one thing.<br>It turned out that what was important was not one&rsquo;s strength or ability. Rather, it was who the person was.<br>As long as it was the correct individual, then any abilities they used would prove effective. However, if it wasn&rsquo;t the right individual, all abilities they used would be ineffective.<br>However, the truth was simply too astonishing. This caused Hu Xuanyi and the others to feel disbelief.<br><br></p></div>
