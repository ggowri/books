        <h1>Chapter 4163</h1>
        <div> - It&rsquo;s You<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking the Dragon Vein Source Stone. However, I&rsquo;m also taking your life.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was not joking. He had no intention to stop. He was determined to kill the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;!&rdquo;<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted gnashed his teeth in anger.<br>The backlash from the protective formation had been caused by their battle. If they wanted to stop the backlash, the two of them would have to stop fighting at the same time.<br>If Chu Feng refused to cooperate, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted would be killed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks should he stop fighting.<br>This situation placed the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted in a very difficult position and made him extremely furious.<br>&ldquo;Very well! Since you want to die, I&rsquo;ll satisfy you!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, neither of us can think about living!&rdquo; The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted snarled with rage.<br>Then, he began to control the protective formation with all his power to attack Chu Feng.<br>He was truly enraged. After all, his all-out attack with the protective formation&rsquo;s power would only increase the intensity of the backlash.<br>That said, Chu Feng had no intention of stopping anyways. Thus, how could he possibly fear the all-out attacks from the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted?<br>Not to be outdone himself, Chu Feng strengthened his own protective formation&rsquo;s power to take on the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>As their battle continued, the intensity of the backlash continued to strengthen.<br>Damaged by the backlash, Chu Feng and the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s bodies were completely destroyed. Only their souls remained. However, even their souls were being attacked by the backlash.<br>Under these circumstances, their consciousnesses began to grow fuzzy.<br>However, after their souls were attacked, the evenly matched battle suddenly changed.<br>As his body continued to be destroyed, as the pain of the backlash continued to attack him, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s willpower began to weaken.<br>With that, his control over the protective formation&rsquo;s powers also began to weaken.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s control did not weaken.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks grew fiercer and fiercer. The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted soon found himself incapable of withstanding Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>Finally, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s protective formation&rsquo;s power was completely defeated by Chu Feng. He could only watch helplessly as the protective formation&rsquo;s power controlled by Chu Feng moved toward him to attack him.<br>Like a magnificent army, like hundreds of millions of ferocious beasts, the white gaseous flames began to frantically attack the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted began screaming miserably.<br>After the attacks ended, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s soul began fading away.<br>After defeating the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, Chu Feng fell powerlessly to the ground.<br>Chu Feng only had his spirit body remaining. However, even his spirit body was on the verge of collapse. It seemed like it could crumble at any moment.<br>Chu Feng was extremely weak, so weak that he could be said to be on the verge of death.<br>The only reason he had been able to last till this point was all because of his enormous willpower.<br>Chu Feng began to transform the power of the protective formation.<br>The protective formation was originally a very strong offensive power..<br>But, Chu Feng was able to change its power to be used for treating injuries.<br>The injuries Chu Feng had sustained had all been caused by the protective formation.<br>As the saying went, whoever started the trouble should end it.<br>If Chu Feng wanted to treat his injuries, the power of the protective formation would naturally serve as the best medicine.<br>Chu Feng had gambled correctly. After using his spirit power to transform the power of the protective formation, the protective formation provided a miraculous effect.<br>As white gaseous flames continued to assimilate into his body, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body began to recover.<br>However, the confrontation between Chu Feng and the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had exhausted the majority of the protective formation&rsquo;s powers. There was not much left.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng ended up depleting all the remaining protective formation&rsquo;s power to treat his injuries.<br>Fortunately, the remaining protective formation&rsquo;s power was enough to thoroughly heal Chu Feng.<br>This could be said to be a miracle.<br>After curing his injuries, Chu Feng stood up and carefully looked around.<br>He was originally excited. But, after examining his surroundings, Chu Feng narrowed his brows, and a look of disappointment appeared in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Were those treasures devoured just like that?&rdquo;<br>The reason for Chu Feng&rsquo;s disappointment was because of the people that had failed to escape the illusion formation, and had ended up being killed by the protective formation.<br>After those people died, they were engulfed by the protective formation. No trace of their bodies remained.<br>While Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t care about their deaths, he knew that they must have had a lot of treasures on them.<br>After all, those world spiritists and the various powers&rsquo; leaders were most definitely renowned people.<br>Chu Feng was certain that they had treasures on them.<br>He had originally thought that once the protective formation&rsquo;s power disappeared, those devoured treasures would reappear.<br>To his surprise, that was not the case. Not a single trace of the treasures remained. It was as if they had all been refined.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re actually still alive?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a look of surprise appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes. Then, he looked to an empty area ahead.<br>Chu Feng extended his palm. Immediately, boundless spirit power rushed forth and landed at the place he was looking at.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>Once the spirit power landed, a scream was heard.<br>At the same time, a figure revealed itself.<br>It was actually the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>Although the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was riddled with wounds and extremely weak, he was still alive.<br>The reason why he was alive was because there was a layer of blood-colored gaseous flames enveloping his body.<br>The blood-colored gaseous flames had originated from the blood-colored horsetail whisk he held in his hand.<br>&ldquo;It actually managed to save you from that ferocious attack.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That horsetail whisk of yours is truly a rare treasure,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;If you want my horsetail whisk, I&rsquo;ll give it to you. You can have it,&rdquo; as the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted spoke, he tossed his blood-colored horsetail whisk to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This is truly a treasure.&rdquo;<br>After receiving the blood-colored horsetail whisk, Chu Feng nodded in satisfaction. Then, he looked to the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted and the corners of his lips rose into a pleased smile. &ldquo;But, don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m going to spare you with this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&hellip; don&rsquo;t kill me. I&rsquo;ll give you all my treasures. I&rsquo;ll give you all of them.&rdquo;<br>As the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted spoke, he took out multiple Cosmos Sacks and tossed all of them to Chu Feng.<br>After catching those Cosmos Sacks, Chu Feng began to examine them.<br>Upon doing so, even he was shocked.<br>Even though he was somewhat prepared, he was still shocked by the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s treasures.<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was simply a mobile treasury.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m keeping all of these.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But to you, these treasures should be extremely precious, no?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re naturally precious. They&rsquo;re treasures that I&rsquo;ve gathered throughout my entire life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I beg of you, please spare me. I&rsquo;ve given everything I have to you.&rdquo;<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was on the verge of crying. As he spoke, he actually dragged his extremely weak body toward Chu Feng and began to kowtow.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be like this. If they&rsquo;re so precious to you, how could I allow you to leave without them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, I&rsquo;ll accept all your treasures. But, I&rsquo;ll also accept your life,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>Hearing those words, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted felt like dying.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what hatred do you have against me that makes you insist on taking my life?!&rdquo; he shouted.<br>However, his shout was extremely powerless and filled with unwillingness.<br>The current him was powerless to fight against Chu Feng. If Chu Feng wanted to kill him, he would most definitely die.<br>&ldquo;What hatred, you ask?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you not remember Asura from the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb and the All-heaven Sect?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s expression changed enormously. When he looked to Chu Feng again, even his voice began to tremble.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually you?!&rdquo;<br></p></div>
