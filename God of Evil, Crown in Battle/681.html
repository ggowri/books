        <div> - Region on the Edge<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>After that, because of Chu Feng&rsquo;s great benevolence, Chun Wu could only continue sharing Martial Markings with Chu Feng.<br>And because they were getting tighter and tighter on time, they even stopped eating and sleeping. Without rest, they searched for Martial Markings.<br>In a situation like this, on the eighth day&rsquo;s night, Chu Feng and Chun Wu both had ninety Martial Markings. If this trend continued, obtaining a hundred Martial Marking before leaving was pretty much not a problem at all.<br>But even so, Chu Feng could really not feel happy. For him, the thing he was most concerned about currently was not Martial Markings. It was another even more important thing. It could be said to be the true goal he entered the Martial Marking Immortal Realm for&mdash;the Martial Marking Immortal Lotus.<br>However, it was already the eighth day since they entered the Martial Marking Immortal Realm. Chu Feng nearly walked everywhere up in the sky and down on the earth, yet he hadn&rsquo;t found the Martial Marking Immortal Lotus. That made Chu Feng very dispirited. The worry and nervousness could be clearly seen on his face.<br>He could not be blamed for his emotions being too obvious since if he could really not find the Martial Marking Immortal Lotus, he would be unable to save Yan Ruyu&rsquo;s life.<br>&ldquo;Junior Wuqing, don&rsquo;t worry. If there are no Martial Marking Immortal Lotuses in the center area of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, I&rsquo;m guessing they will definitely be near the border regions of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm,&rdquo; said Chun Wu, who saw through Chu Feng&rsquo;s worries, with a smile.<br>&ldquo;There are borders to the Martial Marking Immortal Realm?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt a bit surprised. He had travelled in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm for so many days and always felt that it was a place with no edges. How could there be borders?<br>&ldquo;Junior Wuqing, don&rsquo;t forget that the entire Misty Peak is a formation. Since the Martial Marking Immortal Realm is clearly one as well, since it is also created by a formation, no matter how much bigger it is how can there truly be no ends to it?<br>&ldquo;Everyone feels that there are no edges to the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, but it is an illusion totally. Otherwise, it would be impossible to often meet people who similarly entered the Martial Marking Immortal Realm in this vast land.<br>&ldquo;We were actually always wandering in a preset circle, and the reason why there is no feeling of familiarity in the areas we passed by, feeling as if it were the first time, is because everything in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm formlessly changes. That&rsquo;s why we could not realize that we were only walking in circles,&rdquo; Chun Wu explained.<br>&ldquo;No wonder.&rdquo; Hearing up to that point, Chu Feng, too, came to a realization.<br>Actually, when Chu Feng again and again felt others flying above him up high, he had suspected that the hundred people who entered the realm were, in reality, confined within a restricted region. Otherwise, with only a hundred people in such a vast Martial Marking Immortal Realm, how was it possible to have such a great chance of meeting one another?<br>But because he could find no similarities from the places he passed by, and rather, they were all new, foreign environments, he felt that perhaps it was just him overthinking.<br>Looking at it now, however, his suspicions back then were correct. They were indeed walking in circles. However, the Martial Marking Immortal Realm was too profound. So much that even Chu Feng could see through nothing.<br>&ldquo;Senior Chun Wu, within the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, Spirit power is basically useless and no change can be detected. Do you know how to reach the border regions of the Martial marking Immortal Realm?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; Master only told me there were border regions in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm and that those places contain opportunities and oddities. However, similarly, they contain fatal dangers. As for the method to reach that place, she truly did not tell me.<br>&ldquo;Aiya, Master always enjoys being like this. It&rsquo;s like that Map of Unpredictability. She can clearly just give us the benefit of strengthening our Spirit power, but she doesn&rsquo;t and forces us to take the chance and think of ways ourselves.&rdquo;<br>Chun Wu was a bit annoyed because she truly wanted to help Chu Feng, but indeed, she could think of nothing. After all, within the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, Spirit power could not differentiate anything.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it! Our senses are being confused and we cannot determine the direction, but the World Spirit Compass wouldn&rsquo;t also be confused, right?&rdquo; Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes lit up, then shortly after he took out a World Spirit Compass.<br>&ldquo;World Spirit Compass? Junior Wuqing, in this place even Spirit power is useless. How could this thing be useful?&rdquo; Chun Wu felt quite astonished when she looked at the World Spirit Compass in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll know whether it is useful or not when we give it a try.&rdquo; Chu Feng lightly smiled, then used his Spirit power and imbued it into the compass.<br>The World Spirit Compass could determine even concealed dangers, let alone direction. So, when Chu Feng channeled Spirit power into it, very soon, the four directional indications&mdash;north, east, south, west&mdash;appeared.<br>&ldquo;Will&hellip; this truly work?&rdquo; Although the World Spirit Compass had clearly given out the directions, Chun Wu still had her doubts. After all, the Martial Marking Immortal Realm was an enormous formation that came from the Ancient Era. Using such a simple method such as the World Spirit Compass to want to unravel its secrets was really too naive.<br>&ldquo;Heh, like I said, we&rsquo;ll know when we try.&rdquo; Chu Feng did not explain and first chuckled, then followed the World Spirit Compass&rsquo;s indication and walked forward in one direction.<br>&ldquo;Ahh.&rdquo; Seeing that, though Chun Wu felt uncomfortable, she herself could not think of any other effective way so she could only fly over alongside Chu Feng.<br>As the two of them speedily flew, after a short two hours, before him was no longer the vast and endless mountain range, but mist.<br>That mist was golden, and it covered both the sky and the earth. It veiled over everything in front of him; however, if one looked from a distance, the mist seemed more like another type of Spirit Formation that sealed the world in that region.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! It actually succeeded! Junior Wuqing, you are really too smart! It&rsquo;s fortunate that you thought of using the World Spirit Compass.&rdquo;<br>Arriving at that point, Chun Wu was also incomparably excited. She had thought of countless methods but ultimately thought them all to be useless. She never would have expected to a World Spiritist like Chu Feng, the most basic method was actually effective.<br>&ldquo;Heh, sometimes, the simplest way is the best way. Let&rsquo;s go, Senior Chun Wu. Let us see what oddities there are on the borders of the Martial Marking Immortal Realm.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng said those words, he rushed into the golden mist. Chu Feng actually had no interest in other oddities. At present, the thing he wanted to find the most was the Martial Marking Immortal Lotus.<br>And after entering the mist, Chu Feng and Chun Wu very soon felt a burst of strange power. It was the aura of danger, and the deeper they went in, the stronger that aura of danger became.<br>After they walked for an hour in the mist, it reached a point when the gradually heard strange sounds. Moreover, those sounds became clearer and clearer. At the end, in front of them, all sorts of noises continuously echoed out.<br>With sharp ear strength, Chu Feng could determine that it was the sobbing of a woman. It was a very miserable cry, and there were even the howls of unknown entities.<br>&ldquo;Junior Wuqing, this place is too peculiar. Let&rsquo;s not continue walking any deeper.&rdquo; At that instant, Chun Wu tightly hugged onto Chu Feng&rsquo;s arms. The girl who feared not the heavens nor the earth unexpected acted timidly.<br>Looking at Chun Wu&rsquo;s pale-white complexion and glittering eyes, as well as her slightly quivering body, Chu Feng hesitated a bit. But when he recalled that he had yet to find the Martial Marking Immortal Lotus, he did not wish to retreat just like that.<br>So, Chu Feng willed his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to open, and with the Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes&rsquo; unique gaze, he looked deep into the mist.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! What is that thing?!&rdquo; But such a seemingly insignificant event made Chu Feng&rsquo;s pupils abruptly shrink. His countenance too couldn&rsquo;t help changing greatly. Even the hairs on his body stood on end, and large volumes of cold sweat directly seeped through his forehead.<br></p></div>
