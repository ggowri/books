        <h1>Chapter 4048</h1>
        <div> - Wrongly Accused?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, for you to possess such a cultivation at your age, even your father and grandfather cannot compare to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The future of the Ancestral Martial Starfield is most definitely yours.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, that time has yet to arrive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At least for now, the Ancestral Martial Starfield still belongs to me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should admit defeat. If you do, I will not make things difficult for you either.&rdquo;<br>Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s tone was actually very friendly as he spoke to Chu Feng.<br>Because of that, the crowd had a new opinion of him.<br>Very rarely did the crowd see Wuming Doutian acting so magnanimously. He actually chose to halt with certain victory at hand. He did not even plan on teaching Chu Feng a lesson at all.<br>Seeing this, many people were unable to keep themselves from wondering if they'd misunderstood Wuming Doutian.<br>Could it be that Wuming Doutian was not as tyrannical as he was famed to be?<br>At least, when considering his actions when he'd dealt with Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan. One would realize that Wuming Doutian had not attempted to eradicate them either.<br>And now when facing Chu Feng, he was also acting the same way.<br>Even though Chu Feng threatened his overlord status, he still chose to spare him.<br>Could it be that he is also a person that cherishes talents?<br>&ldquo;Why bother to act this hypocritical? If you&rsquo;re truly capable, then come defeat me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, I&rsquo;m afraid your Wuming Clan will not be able to retrieve its overlord status,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>He did not appreciate Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s modesty at all.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you&rsquo;re one to refuse to shed a tear until you see your coffin. Since that&rsquo;s the case, I will give you what you want.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Wuming Doutian attacked Chu Feng again.<br>Chu Feng was not one to be polite either. He held his weapon and rushed over to meet Wuming Doutian.<br>As the two men fought, energy ripples surged once again.<br>The surroundings were once again enveloped by their powerful auras.<br>It could be said that all the people present were living under their shadows.<br>However, this time, things were somewhat different from last time.<br>Even though they were still unable to see the details of the battle, they were able to sense that Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura was being suppressed.<br>&ldquo;Although Chu Feng possesses exceptional talent, he is, at least for now, not a match for Wuming Doutian.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no surprise. After all, Wuming Doutian has ruled the Ancestral Martial Starfield for that many years. Even if Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation has caught up to his, he cannot make up for his deficiency in battle experience.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear, that whilst both have the same level of cultivation, Chu Feng will not be able to defeat Wuming Doutian.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, Chu Feng&rsquo;s been protecting us the entire time. Could he be affected because of that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That definitely has something to do with it. However, the effect shouldn't be much. It mainly comes down to Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power being inferior to Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s. Otherwise, there wouldn&rsquo;t be such an enormous disparity between them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that Chu Feng will definitely be defeated by Wuming Doutian today?&rdquo;<br>Sensing that Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura was growing weaker and weaker, whereas Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s aura was growing stronger and stronger, the crowd were unable to keep themselves from quietly discussing the fight.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the energy ripples wreaking havoc all around disappeared once more.<br>The battle between Chu Feng and Wuming Doutian had come to a stop again.<br>As the energy ripples dissipated, their silhouettes clearly appeared before the crowd again.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s condition was similar to before. He was still dripping with sweat and gasping for breath. The only difference was that not only was the arm in which Chu Feng&rsquo;s held his weapon violently trembling; his entire body was also violently trembling.<br>Chu Feng had become even weaker than before.<br>Logically, seeing Chu Feng like that, everyone would think that he was already done for.<br>However, it just so happened that the crowd were not very certain.<br>The reason for that was because they were shocked to discover that Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s condition had changed too.<br>His complexion had turned very ugly.<br>Even though Wuming Doutian did not have any injuries on his body and still seemed completely unscathed, his complexion had grown extremely pale.<br>He seemed even weaker than Chu Feng.<br>It was as if he were on the verge of death.<br>He was also forming hand seals single-handedly with a deep frown. He seemed like he was trying his hardest to resist something.<br>&ldquo;Puchi~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Wuming Doutian trembled, then a vast amount of blood sprayed out of his mouth.<br>Although it was blood, the blood was pitch-black.<br>After vomiting the mouthful of blood, Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s expression turned even uglier than before.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that Chu Feng caused him internal injuries?&rdquo;<br>The crowd felt puzzled by Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s behavior.<br>Chu Feng looked like he had experienced a bitter struggle.<br>Even though he was not injured, he appeared to be completely exhausted, and looked rather miserable.<br>However, Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s condition was somewhat different.<br>Right when the crowd were confused, Chu Feng spoke. &ldquo;It would appear that the forbidden medicine has flared up.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What? Forbidden medicine?!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words immediately gave rise to endless waves in the hearts of the crowd.<br>His words made the crowd realize that Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s symptoms did in fact resemble those of someone suffering a backlash from taking a forbidden medicine.<br>Could it be that Wuming Doutian had not been able to suppress Chu Feng earlier because of his superior battle experience, but rather because he had taken a forbidden medicine to increase his battle power?<br>If that were the case, it would truly be too humiliating.<br>To fight against a person of the younger generation as a senior was already an act that was beneath one&rsquo;s dignity.<br>To take forbidden medicine on top of that would simply be excessively humiliating.<br>As the great ruler of the Starfield Master Realm, would he really do something like that?<br>&ldquo;Puchi~~~&rdquo;<br>Right when the crowd were feeling skeptical, Wuming Doutian vomited another mouthful of blood.<br>After vomiting the second mouthful of blood, Wuming Doutian became even weaker. He actually fell to one knee in midair.<br>&ldquo;Lord Realm Master!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, the Wuming Clan&rsquo;s Six Great Utmost Exalteds and Ten Great Experts all rushed over to Wuming Doutian to treat his injuries.<br>However, Wuming Doutian waved his hand at them and indicated for them to stay put.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, what this old man is suffering from is an illness. It&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;ve taken a forbidden medicine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man admits that your talent is superior to my own. However, you cannot frame this old man just because you&rsquo;re unable to defeat me,&rdquo; said Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;So it was actually an illness?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Indeed, that does seem like the symptoms of a serious illness.&rdquo;<br>The crowd entered a spirited discussion again.<br>Chu Feng, on the other hand, smiled with contempt.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that you were this shameless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When you were fighting against me earlier, your battle power was unable to match my own. I personally saw you swallowing a forbidden medicine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet now, you&rsquo;re actually refusing to admit it? Truly never would I have expected that a disappointment like you had once ruled over the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>Contempt and disappointment filled Chu Feng&rsquo;s face and voice.<br>What he'd said was the truth. He had indeed personally witnessed Wuming Doutian swallowing a forbidden medicine. Furthermore, the forbidden medicine he'd swallowed was extremely powerful and precious.<br>Chu Feng was disappointed at Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s character, disappointed at how he did not dare to admit the fact that he'd taken a forbidden medicine.<br>&ldquo;The world of martial cultivators has always been one where the victor is king and the losers are deemed bandits. I am ill. It just so happens that my illness has chosen flare up at this time. This is my own issue. Even if I am to be defeated by you because of it, I will not blame you for it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, you should never have wrongly accused me of taking a forbidden medicine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;ve done is an insult to my integrity.&rdquo;<br>As Wuming Doutian spoke, he flipped his wrist, and a dark black pill appeared in his hand.<br>The crowd&rsquo;s eyes all shone upon seeing that pill.<br>They were all able to tell that it was a forbidden medicine.<br>&ldquo;It is common knowledge to everyone that powerful forbidden medicines can only be taken once within a short period of time. If one is to take multiple powerful forbidden medicines in succession, one will only end up causing one&rsquo;s own body to explode, and die.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I had indeed taken forbidden medicine earlier, I will definitely not be able to withstand the power of this forbidden medicine.&rdquo;<br>After Wuming Doutian said those words, the Wuming Clan&rsquo;s experts all started panicking.<br>&ldquo;Lord Realm Master, you mustn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;<br>However, Wuming Doutian waved his hand at them again.<br>&ldquo;Even if I, Wuming Doutian, have to risk my life today, I must still prove my innocence.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, he tossed the forbidden medicine into his mouth.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Once the forbidden medicine entered his mouth, purple gaseous flames were immediately released from his body.<br>When the purple gaseous flames were released, Wuming Doutian regained his vigor. His morbid state of health had disappeared completely. Even his aura grew much stronger than before.<br>If the previous Wuming Doutian was an existence that was difficult for Chu Feng to defeat, then the current Wuming Doutian would be an even more difficult existence for Chu Feng to defeat.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that Lord Realm Master didn&rsquo;t lie. He indeed did not take a forbidden medicine earlier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t possibly be able to survive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right. Forbidden medicines that are too powerful absolutely cannot be taken in succession. It would be suicide to do so.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that it&rsquo;s Chu Feng that&rsquo;s actually lying. He actually wrongly accused Lord Realm Master!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Never would I have ever imagined that Chu Feng would be this despicable. Taking advantage of the fact that Lord Realm Master is suffering from his illness, he actually framed him by saying that he'd taken a forbidden medicine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sigh~~~&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd looked at Chu Feng with contempt.<br>After Wuming Doutian proved his innocence, practically everyone felt that it was Chu Feng who was lying.<br>They all felt that he was framing Wuming Doutian.<br></p></div>
