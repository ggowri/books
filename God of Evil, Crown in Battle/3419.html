        <h1>Chapter 3418</h1>
        <div> - The Tyrannical Chu Feng<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no problem with the gate that I&rsquo;ve opened,&rdquo; That female world spirit said in an extremely serious manner.<br>&ldquo;Regardless of whether there&rsquo;s a problem with it or not, it is you who opened that gate. I do not possess such remarkable abilities that I am capable of tampering with your world spirit gate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as I permit you to open a world spirit gate and you manage to successfully open one, there shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue with the world spirit gate. Even if there&rsquo;s an issue, it would not be related to me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Hearing those words, that female world spirit was suddenly startled. She began to carefully ponder Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. It seemed like it was as Chu Feng had said.<br>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; The female world spirit asked.<br>&ldquo;It is most likely caused by my mother,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your mother again?&rdquo; The female world spirit revealed a look of surprise.<br>&ldquo;That seems to be the case. It seems that all of the world spirits that have entered a contract with me are unable to leave because she's left behind a special spirit formation inside my world spirit space,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Bastard, why did you enter a contract with me then?!&rdquo; The female world spirit was completely exasperated.<br>&ldquo;Oh please! It is not me who begged you to enter a contract with me. Rather, it was you who begged me to enter a contract with you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Enough of your nonsense; how am I to return?&rdquo; The female world spirit asked angrily. As she spoke, she once again unleashed her overwhelming oppressive might toward Chu Feng.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s reaction was extremely fast. At practically the same moment as the female world spirit unleashed her oppressive might, with a thought, she immediately revealed a pained expression, grabbed her head, and crouched down on the ground.<br>&ldquo;My lady mother&rsquo;s world spirit techniques far surpass my own. If I had a way to breach her spirit formation, I would&rsquo;ve allowed Milady Queen to return home long ago.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I can only tell you this, since it&rsquo;s a spirit formation set up by my lady mother, both you and I are powerless to do anything about it. Thus, you should resign yourself to fate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, you only have a single path to take. That is, you are to fight alongside me. After all, both you and I possess a common enemy -- that old cat.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When I find that old cat in the future, I will retrieve what it had taken from me, and you can take your young miss away. With that, we will be even,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;With this damned spirit formation here, even if I found my young miss, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to return,&rdquo; said that female world spirit.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to worry about that. I will go and search for my lady mother in the future. At that time, I will ask her to remove the spirit formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for now, I am going to leave. If you need anything, you can communicate with me. Even if my consciousness leaves this world spirit space, you will still be able to communicate with me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, before I leave, I need to tell you this frankly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milady Queen is currently undergoing closed-door training. However, I do not trust you. Thus, in order to prevent you from causing Milady Queen harm, I must restrict you until&hellip; I can trust you.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, the expression of pain on that world spirit&rsquo;s face started to ease. However, a magnificent brilliance was currently overflowing from her body, and turned into a rope that bound her.<br>&ldquo;Bastard! You dare imprison me?!&rdquo; The female world spirit&rsquo;s face became deathly white with anger.<br>&ldquo;You dare to attempt to kill me, why wouldn&rsquo;t I dare to imprison you? Obediently reflect upon your actions. Otherwise&hellip; you will remain tied up for the rest of your life,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Just you wait! I will make you regret your actions!&rdquo; Being tied up, the killing intent in the female world spirit&rsquo;s eye grew even more intense.<br>Chu Feng smiled disapprovingly. Then, he cast his consciousness back into his body.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng discovered that the previously pitch-black surroundings were gradually brightening.<br>It was an isolated space. That isolated space was very desolate.<br>However, as the light spread, living things began to grow in that previously desolate world.<br>Flowers, plants and trees sprouted from the bald earth.<br>They began to grow extremely fast. In merely an instant, green covered the previously desolate surroundings.<br>Chu Feng took a glance at the nearby Linghu Hongfei, and discovered that Linghu Hongfei was also looking at him.<br>Linghu Hongfei had an expressionless look on his face. However, his gaze was akin to sharp blades. They were filled with killing intent.<br>Chu Feng ignored Linghu Hongfei and looked towards Wuma Shengjie, the Liangqiu Sisters and Tantai Xing&rsquo;er.<br>Chu Feng bent down and began to diagnose and treat their injuries.<br>All four of them were injured to a certain degree. Fortunately, their injuries were not serious, and would not hinder them in the future.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng waved his sleeve. A burst of spirit power turned into dazzling light. Like rain, the light sprinkled down on the unconscious people.<br>With that, the people inside the grand formation regained their consciousnesses in succession.<br>&ldquo;We&hellip; what happened?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Where is this?&rdquo;<br>Upon waking up, the crowd all displayed the same behavior. They were completely confused, and did not know what was happening. They did not even know where they were. It was as if they had completely forgotten what had happened earlier.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, why would this be the case?&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei turned to ask Chu eng.<br>Once the others woke up, Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s attitude toward Chu Feng immediately changed. Even though he hated Chu Feng to the bones, his current attitude toward him was as good-natured as before.<br>Seeing Linghu Hongfei like that, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed. He felt admiration for Linghu Hongfei from the bottom of his heart.<br>Even though he knew that Linghu Hongfei was pretending, his disguise was simply too good.<br>This was truly a sort of ability!!!<br></p></div>
