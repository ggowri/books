        <div> - So That&rsquo;s The Case<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Huu---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, rumbles sounded repeatedly from the sky above.<br>Looking up, Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er immediately turned ashen.<br>A terrifying tornado was descending from above.<br>Although it was also wind, she would not be able to withstand the incoming wind attack.<br>Even though that tornado has yet to descend upon her, she already realized what would happen.<br>Unfortunately, it was too late. All her abilities were massively decreased in this place.<br>She lacked even the strength to shout. Thus, how could she possibly withstand the incoming terrifying wind descending from the sky?<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>Right when Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er thought that she was going to die, a figure suddenly appeared before her and blocked the tornado.<br>Naturally, that person was Chu Feng.<br>To Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s surprise, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was currently enveloped in a layer of power.<br>It was a faint layer of light. That light looked very weak.<br>Yet, that faint layer of light managed to forcibly take on the terrifying tornado descending from the sky.<br>At the time when Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er was shocked, Chu Feng grabbed her wrist and rushed toward the exterior region of the terrifying power.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s that surrounding us?&rdquo; Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er asked Chu Feng.<br>Even though the faint light was also enveloping her, Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er knew that faint light had nothing to do with her. Instead, it was caused by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know either. This was here the moment I came to this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It seemed as if this place had bestowed this power to me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;A power bestowed to you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How come I don&rsquo;t have it?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng doesn&rsquo;t know how to answer her.<br>He couldn&rsquo;t possibly tell her that the reason why she was not bestowed that power might be because her talent was insufficient.<br>That would be too much of a mental blow.<br>But, while Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t say anything, Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er had a rough idea as to why that was the case.<br>Even though it was something very damaging to one&rsquo;s ego, she was already prepared for it.<br>There was a reason why Xianhai Shaoyu warned her to not enter this place.<br>Her talent was indeed not enough to enter this place.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you must bring back my lord young master,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he your big brother? How did he become your lord young master?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with narrowed eyes.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s expression changed greatly upon hearing those words.<br>She suddenly realized that she had misspoken.<br>&ldquo;Forget about it. You don&rsquo;t have to explain things to me.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the look of difficulty on Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just directly ask your young master instead.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Xin&rsquo;er, leave this place and wait for us outside,&rdquo; Chu Feng added.<br>But, Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t want to leave.<br>She was still worried for Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Rumble---&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, the rumbles above grew even more ear-piercing.<br>They looked up and saw that the power above their heads had undergone a transformation.<br>Fire, wind and lightning, those three powers grew fiercer and fiercer. Their oppressive mights were also increasing.<br>Earlier, the location they were at was still relatively safe.<br>But, as the power above their heads continued to strengthen, even this place was no longer safe.<br>&ldquo;Why is this happening?&rdquo;<br>At the same time she felt uneasy, Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er was more confused.<br>This was a place that had completely surpassed her control.<br>The fear in her heart had practically reached a peak level.<br>&ldquo;Listen to me and wait outside. If you continue to stay here, I&rsquo;ll have to protect you too. How am I supposed to go help your young master then?&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er.<br>Truth was, Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er could tell the situation before her even without Chu Feng telling her.<br>She was unable to help Chu Feng with anything. If she continues to stay around, she will only become a burden.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you must be careful.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er turned around and left.<br>As for Chu Feng, he immediately proceeded toward the depths of that gathered power.<br>Even though he knew that the deeper he penetrated, the more dangerous it would become, Chu Feng had no other choice.<br>Sure enough, things were as Chu Feng anticipated.<br>As he entered deeper, the powers in the sky grew increasingly fiercer.<br>At the beginning, only violent winds and tornados were attacking him. Then, flames started crashing down from above like waterfalls.<br>In the end, the lightnings, roaring like ferocious beasts, also began to attack Chu Feng. They were trying to crush Chu Feng to tatters.<br>But, to his surprise, the light enveloped around him was more powerful than he imagined it to be. Even those three different powers were unable to breach that light.<br>Furthermore, blocking those three different sorts of power was quite effortless.<br>Chu Feng felt as if he would not be harmed by those powers here, regardless of how terrifying they might seem, as long as he had that body of light around him.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng began to accelerate.<br>Even though the powers attacking him were growing stronger nonstop the deeper he entered, they were all blocked by the faint body of light surrounding him.<br>With this, Chu Feng soon arrived at the center-most region of this gathered power.<br>At this place, he saw Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, what are you doing?!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng shouted at Xianhai Shouyu after seeing him.<br>The reason for that was because he discovered that Xianhai Shaoyu was floating in midair. Not only was he in the center of that terrifying power, he was also approaching it.<br>Furthermore, there was also a layer of light resembling the one he had around Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s body.<br>That body of light was also protecting Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>But, at this time, Xianhai Shaoyu had removed that body of light.<br>It seemed as if he didn&rsquo;t want to receive that light&rsquo;s protection and was using his physical body to withstand the nonstop attacks.<br>Chu Feng was extremely confused by his actions.<br>After all, Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s current situation was not looking good at all.<br>His complexion was already deathly pale and his expression completely twisted.<br>Even though he was clenching his teeth and barely persisting onward, things will definitely endanger his life if he was to continue on like this.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve come!&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng, Xianhai Shaoyu revealed a smile on his twisted face.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, what are you doing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why are you using your body to bear that power?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng asked that because he knew that there must be a reason why Xianhai Shaoyu was acting like this.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, sense carefully, examine carefully.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With your capability, you should be able to tell,&rdquo; Xianhai Shaoyu said to Chu Feng.<br>After saying those words, Xianhai Shaoyu closed his eyes and began to concentrate on withstanding the power of this place again.<br>Strangely, after Xianhai Shaoyu closed his eyes, the powers attacking him grew even more violent. It seemed as if Xianhai Shaoyu was able to control the intensity of the power attacking him.<br>Seeing this, Chu Feng no longer continued to ask Xianhai Shaoyu what he was doing. Instead, he started to carefully examine the surroundings.<br>Upon doing so, his eyes started to blaze with emotions.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case!&rdquo; Chu Feng gasped in admiration.<br></p></div>
