        <div> - Transmogrification Gate<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;However, you can rest assured. I will definitely go all-out to find that monster and take care of him. Consider that as my compensation for taking control of your lover&rsquo;s bodies,&rdquo; After the Moon Immortal finished saying those words, she disappeared.<br>Likely, she had gone to search for the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master as she had declared she would.<br>Merely, seeing Su Rou and Su Mei disappearing before his eyes caused Chu Feng to feel extremely complicated in his heart.<br>Suddenly, the Elf King&rsquo;s voice sounded, &ldquo;It would seem that the Moon Immortal is not evil. Your lovers should be fine.&rdquo;  Chu Feng turned around and discovered that the Elf King was standing not far away from him. It would seem that he had heard the conversation Chu Feng had with the Moon Immortal.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng looked into the distance. He discovered that the massacre of the Dark Hall&rsquo;s headquarters had already entered its ending phase.<br>Regardless of whether they were the people from the Dark Hall, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts or the elders and elites of the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace that had submitted to the Dark Hall, they were practically all killed by the Alliance Army.<br>The curtain had dropped for this battle. However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart was unable to be at ease. Instead, it grew even more heavy.<br>Likely, it was not only him. Instead, everyone from the Alliance Army should be feeling this way. After all, they had all experienced the frightening power of the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Your Majesty, I&rsquo;m afraid that the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master will be difficult to deal with. We must make preparations,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master should have cultivated a demonic technique. His demonic technique is related to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts. Indeed, it is difficult to deal with. Little friend Chu Feng, if you have any suggestions, speak away,&rdquo; The Elf King said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;The demonic technique that the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master cultivated is not only related to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts. In fact, it concerns all living things in the Holy Land of Martialism,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, what do you mean by that?&rdquo; The Elf King asked.<br>&ldquo;The fusion of the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master with the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts is only a part of it. What he planned to do next is the most frightening. That is, he planned to use the lives of all the living things in this world to increase his cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He is planning to refine all of the living things in the Holy Land of Martialism. He does not care about the quality, and instead only cares about the quantity. The reason for that is because the demonic technique that he trained in only cares about the quantity of lives refined,&rdquo; Chu Feng told the Elf King what Xue Ji had said to him.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, is what you said for certain? How do you know about this?&rdquo; The Elf King asked with a frown. He also realized that the situation was bad.<br>Ten thousand years ago, the calamity brought forth by the Magma Emperor was already an extremely frightening one. However, if what Chu Feng said was true, then another calamity would befall them now.<br>Living things? That would not only include the humans, monstrous beasts and Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves. Living things also included plants, flowers, and trees, as well as birds and animals.<br>Ten thousand years ago, the Magma Emperor had wanted to rule over the Holy Land of Martialism. However, today, that Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master wanted to completely eliminate all living things in the Holy Land of Martialism. He planned to turn the Holy Land of Martialism into a land of death.<br>Compared to the appearance of the Magma Emperor, the appearance of the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was, without a doubt, the true calamity.<br>&ldquo;Senior, truth be told, that Dark Hall&rsquo;s Xue Ji is the Asura World Spirit that I released at the Nangong Imperial Clan. She was the one that told me all that,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s your World Spirit? But, shouldn&rsquo;t she have become an Evil Spirit after you released her? Why am I unable to sense any Evil Spirit&rsquo;s aura from her?&rdquo;  After hearing this, the Elf King was astonished.<br>&ldquo;I am also very confused by it. To be honest, I did not know much about that Evil Spirit to begin with. However, it remains that she saved my life earlier. Even though I do not know what she plans to do, and I also feel that she is very dangerous, I feel that what she said was definitely not to deceive me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;It would seem that we must think of a way to handle this matter then,&rdquo; At that moment, the Elf King was frowning deeply. He appeared to have entered deep into his thoughts.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!! There&rsquo;s a place that could shelter the people of the Holy Land of Martialism.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, although the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master is still unable to gain complete control over his power, I feel that he will soon be able to do so. The time that we have to evacuate everyone is truly too short,&rdquo; The Elf King said with a frown.<br>&ldquo;There really is a place that could shelter all the living things in the Holy Land of Martialism?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing we can do about the plants and animals. However, we can evacuate the human and monstrous beast elites.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Before the great calamity, if we are unable to stop it, we can only think of a way to lower the damage to its minimum,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>Chu Feng approved of the Elf King&rsquo;s opinion. If they really could not stop the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, then decreasing the damage would be the only thing they could do.<br>&ldquo;Is the place that you spoke of in the Elf Kingdom?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not in our Elf Kingdom. The grand formation in our Elf Kingdom is also unable to withstand the assault from a Half Martial Ancestor,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;Then&hellip; exactly where is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The place is called the Transmogrification Gate. The Transmogrification Gate is something from the Ancient Era. Unless its master opens the gate, no one will be able to find it. As such, how could one possibly enter it? Thus, that place is definitely safe because the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master will also not be able to find it,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such a place? Then, exactly where is that Transmogrification Gate? Who is its master?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I do not know about the exact location of the Transmogrification Gate. The reason for that is because the Transmogrification Gate has been wandering through the Holy Land of Martialism the entire time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I am able to find its general location. As for the owner of the Transmogrification Gate, it is the head of the Holy Land of Martialism&rsquo;s Ten Immortals, the Heaven Reaching Immortal,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;The Heaven Reaching Immortal?&rdquo; Chu Feng was astonished.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, it's the Heaven Reaching Immortal. Did you know that although the Heaven Reaching Immortal is extremely renowned right now, he was only a Gold-cloak World Spiritist before he reached two thousand years of age? Furthermore, his cultivation was also very limited.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, the reason why he was able to live for over ten thousand years and reach his current level of strength is because he had managed to obtain a great fortunate encounter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for his fortunate encounter, he coincidentally saved the previous master of the Transmogrification Gate. That person was at the end of his life. He saw that although the Heaven Reaching Immortal&rsquo;s talent was not that good, his moral conduct was very good. Thus, he dubbed the Heaven Reaching Immortal the new master of the Transmogrification Gate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is precisely by relying on the power of the Transmogrification Gate that the Heaven Reaching Immortal reached his current level of strength.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, only a very few people know about this matter. Likely, only three people in the Holy Land of Martialism know about it right now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They are the Heaven Reaching Immortal, me and now you,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected the Heaven Reaching Immortal to have such a secret. No wonder no one was capable of finding him,&rdquo; Chu Feng finally realized why the Heaven Reaching Immortal was so mysterious.<br>&ldquo;Your Majesty, since you knew about this, you must be close friends with the Heaven Reaching Immortal, right? In that case, it would seem that the people of the world can be saved,&rdquo; The way Chu Feng saw it, it was most likely the Heaven Reaching Immortal who had told the Elf King about this secret and the general location of the Transmogrification Gate. As such, their relationship must be special.<br><br></p></div>
