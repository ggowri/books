        <h1>Chapter 4542</h1>
        <div>: The Incomplete Mantra<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amongst the crowd gathered here around the sculpture, there were those who shrieked in horror, but at the same time, there were also those who roared in excitement.<br>Those who were more cowardly turned around and fled the area. Only the gutsier ones dared to stay around to continue watching the phenomenon.<br>It was not without reason that the crowd was reacting in such a manner. The war god sculpture had begun shuddering under the torrent of wind and lightning, as if it was being infused with life.<br>There were even some who saw bone-chilling murderous intent in its eyes.<br>However, the truth was that it was all just an illusion. It was simply a mirage produced by the storm that created the impression that the sculpture was coming to life.<br>&ldquo;As expected of an artifact left behind by the Rampaging Storm Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder why there are rumors that the Holy Light Clan intended to take this war god sculpture away with them but were unable to do so. It looks like there&rsquo;s indeed something special about it!&rdquo;<br>The crowd remarked in awe.<br>While the crowd was marveling at the incredible craftsmanship behind this war god sculpture, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes were fixated on the mouth of the war god sculpture.<br>Infused with the power of the storm, the war god sculpture looked as if it was alive. There was a flicker in its eyes, and its hands were moving as well. There were even subtle movements from its fingers. Needless to say, its mouth was also opening and closing ever so slightly too.<br>While these effects were just a mirage&mdash;the sculpture actually hadn&rsquo;t moved in the least at all&mdash;Chu Feng still noticed a pattern in its movement.<br>The mouth of the sculpture wasn&rsquo;t just moving incessantly without any order. Instead, it appeared to be conveying a message.<br>Thus, Chu Feng used his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to take a closer look, and the results didn&rsquo;t let him down. The war god sculpture was chanting a mantra.<br>Chu Feng had no idea what this mantra was used for, but he still made sure to memorize every single word of it.<br>But before Chu Feng could take down the full mantra, the storm shrouding suddenly began to dissipate, causing the war god sculpture to swiftly revert back to normal. As a result, he only managed to memorize an incomplete mantra.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, do you know when this sculpture phenomenon will appear again?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to Long Xiaoxiao and asked.<br>While he had no idea what that mantra was used for, he had a feeling that it was bound to be something extraordinary. After all, this was a heritage left behind by that legendary Rampaging Storm Clan!<br>&ldquo;I heard that this phenomenon doesn&rsquo;t appear commonly. It could take from a few years to several centuries before it happens again. I was just intending to come here to take a look at the sculpture, but who could have thought that we would be so lucky as to stumble upon the legendary phenomenon?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao remarked happily.<br>&ldquo;Is that so? We were really lucky then.&rdquo;<br>Despite saying such words, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but feel deeply disappointed on the inside.<br>If what Long Xiaoxiao said was true, Chu Feng would have probably no chance to uncover the full mantra. Even if it only took just a few months for the phenomenon to reappear, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t have the luxury to be squandering his time here. After all, there were still too many things that he had to do.<br>He couldn&rsquo;t invest so much of his time in something which he didn&rsquo;t even know the use for.<br>&ldquo;This young friend over here, are you&hellip; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>A voice suddenly sounded beside Chu Feng at this moment.<br>In truth, Chu Feng had already noticed that someone was staring at him, but he didn&rsquo;t pay any heed to it thus far. He didn&rsquo;t think that there would be anyone else who could recognize him here.<br>So, he turned his head over to look at the person who just called him.<br>It was an old man, but his face looked unfamiliar. Chu Feng was certain that he wasn&rsquo;t acquainted with this old man.<br>&ldquo;May I know who you are?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked politely.<br>As soon as Chu Feng asked that question, a delighted smile broke out of the old man&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really you, young friend Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>The old man became extremely agitated upon realizing that he had got the right person. He quickly took out a token from his chest and flashed it to Chu Feng.<br>Written on the token were the words &lsquo;Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;.<br>It went without saying that Chu Feng recognized this clan. It was the clan which Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s mother, Gu Mingyuan, came from.<br>The Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo; was one of the strongest powers in the Ancestral Martial Starfield other than the Wuming Clan and the three cities.<br>Given Chu Feng&rsquo;s ties with Chu Lingxi and Gu Mingyuan, as well as his widespread reputation in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, it wasn&rsquo;t too surprising for someone from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan to recognize him.<br>&ldquo;Ah, so it&rsquo;s an elder from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan!&rdquo; Chu Feng greeted amicably.<br>&ldquo;Yes. This old man&rsquo;s name is Gu Yang, and I&rsquo;m an elder from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan,&rdquo; Gu Yang introduced himself to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you, Elder Gu Yang. Elder, if I may ask, what are you doing here? Could it be that Chu Lingxi and Elder Gu Mingyuan are here too?&rdquo;<br>The first thought that came to Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind was that they could have been accompanying Chu Lingxi here.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng is indeed sharp-witted. Yes, Lingxi is here to attend the tournament too, and we&rsquo;re here to accompany her,&rdquo; Gu Yang replied.<br>&ldquo;Oh? May I ask where Lingxi and Elder Gu are at at the moment?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was overjoyed to hear that Chu Lingxi was really here.<br>Thinking about it, ever since the battle between the Chu Heavenly Clan and the Linghu Heavenly Clan, he had never met Chu Lingxi and Gu Mingyuan anymore.<br>Since fate had brought them together here, it was only natural for him to pay them a visit. Otherwise, who knew when they would have a chance to meet one another again?<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, allow me to lead you over,&rdquo; Gu Yang said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be troubling you then, Elder Gu.&rdquo;<br>With this, Gu Yang began leading the way forward, and Chu Feng followed him.<br>It went without saying that Long Xiaoxiao and the others also tagged along with Chu Feng as well since there was nothing else to see now that the phenomenon was over.<br>However, when Gu Yang noticed the huge procession behind Chu Feng, a slight knit formed on his forehead as he asked doubtfully, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, are they your friends?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re all my friends. Elder Gu, is there a problem?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could sense that there was a deeper intention behind Gu Yang&rsquo;s question.<br>&ldquo;Hmm&hellip; Pardon me when I say this, but I&rsquo;m afraid that it won&rsquo;t be convenient for all of them to come along with us,&rdquo; Gu Yang voiced his opinion uncomfortably.<br>Those words immediately incurred the wrath of the crowd. One must know that the group that was tagging along with Chu Feng right now were the elites of the younger generation in the Holy Light Galaxy, so they were highly respected no matter where they went.<br>To put it in a harsher way, they wouldn&rsquo;t have even spared a glance to Gu Yang if not for the fact that he was obviously acquainted with Chu Feng. In their view, Chu Feng was nothing more than an ant.<br>&ldquo;Inconvenient? Do you know who we are? Are you trying to say that we&rsquo;re inconveniencing you?&rdquo;<br>Someone in Chu Feng&rsquo;s group began voicing his dissatisfaction toward Gu Yang&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;Shut your mouth! How can you act so disrespectfully to young master Chu Feng&rsquo;s elder? Hurry up and apologize!&rdquo;<br>However, that person was met with Yin Daifen&rsquo;s angry scolding right after. As it turned out, the one who had spoken up was from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect.<br>Yin Daifen&rsquo;s scolding made that person realize that he had spoken out of place too. While he felt indignant to have to apologize to someone of Gu Yang&rsquo;s caliber, he still lowered his head and did so out of deference to Yin Daifen and Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No no, there&rsquo;s no need to apologize. I&rsquo;m at fault here too. It&rsquo;s just that&hellip; it&rsquo;s really a little inconvenient,&rdquo; Gu Yang replied with a sheepish smile.<br>His temper was surprisingly good, such that he didn&rsquo;t lose his temper despite having been berated by someone far younger than him.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, you should head back first. I&rsquo;ll look for you all later on,&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to Long Xiaoxiao and the others and said.<br>Despite Long Xiaoxiao and Yin Daifen&rsquo;s high prestige amongst the younger generation, they were still very heeding of Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. And given that even Long Xiaoxiao and Yin Daifen were already leading by example, the other juniors couldn&rsquo;t possibly pull their weight and act wilfully either.<br>As such, Chu Feng and Gu Yang were left to travel with one another.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I must say that it&rsquo;s really a huge relief to be able to meet you here. You must talk to that lass, Lingxi, properly and have her reconsider her decision!&rdquo; Gu Yang exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;Reconsider her decision? Did something happen to Lingxi?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br></p></div>
