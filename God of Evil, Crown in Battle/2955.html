        <div> - Exceeding The Old Ancestor<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>After Chu Feng accepted the conditions, Chu Xuanzhengfa waved his hand, and several people from the Law Enforcement Hall immediately understood his intention and left.<br>Not long afterward, those several people returned. When they returned, they were carrying an object suspended in midair.<br>That object was a flight of steps made of glass. There was a total of nine steps.<br>Chu Feng had seen that flight of steps before. Back in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm&rsquo;s Heavenly Road, Chu Feng&rsquo;s father had tested his potential for martial cultivation using precisely that flight of steps.<br>As for that flight of steps, it was called the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, this flight of steps is called the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps. It is something that all of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations will have to ascend when they reach twenty years of age.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps mainly tests the Heavenly Bloodline possessor&rsquo;s perseverance. The reason for that is because a Heavenly Bloodline possessor&rsquo;s perseverance is critical to their cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, the path of martial cultivation is a path of perseverance. This is especially true for us, possessors of Heavenly Bloodlines. We need to train in the Self-Punishing Mysterious Technique. With each breakthrough in cultivation, we will receive the tribulation of Heavenly Lightning. While one&rsquo;s body&rsquo;s composition is one aspect to whether or not one will be able to withstand the Heavenly Lightning&rsquo;s Tribulation, one&rsquo;s willpower, and one&rsquo;s perseverance, is the most important.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for this Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps, it will resonate with your Heavenly Lightning Bloodline with each step that you ascend. The pain that you receive will also increase with each step.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That pain will affect your movement. It will be very easy to retreat. However, to continue ascending the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps will be very difficult.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The higher you can climb, the greater your perseverance will be. In turn, your future accomplishments might be even higher too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In a nutshell, the higher one can ascend, the greater one&rsquo;s talent will be.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, today, you must ascend to the eighth step in order to pass the test.&rdquo;<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa explained the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps to Chu Feng in detail.<br>However, when Chu Xuanzhengfa said the final sentence, an ashamed expression appeared on his face.<br>He knew very well that ascending to the eighth step was too excessive of a demand.<br>However, to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, Chu Feng only answered with &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;<br>After agreeing to it, Chu Feng began to walk toward the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps.<br>This scene shocked many of the people present. Did Chu Feng not understand what Chu Xuanzhengfa said, or was he truly unafraid?<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you really think you can ascend to the eighth step?&rdquo; Right at that moment, a mocking question sounded from the crowd.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa had already ordered the crowd to stop talking.<br>Yet that person still dared to talk. Furthermore, he was mocking Chu Feng. The reason why that person dared to do so was because he was Chu Huanyu.<br>As one of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s most talented geniuses right now, Chu Huanyu was not afraid of bringing trouble upon himself.<br>The reason for that was because he knew he was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s future. Regardless of how enormous of a scene he might make, the Chu Heavenly Clan would not really make things difficult for him. On the contrary, they would only protect him.<br>That was the reason why he was so confident.<br>Once Chu Huanyu said those words, many of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations felt very refreshed. What Chu Huanyu said was actually also what they wanted to say.<br>Faced with the crowd&rsquo;s gazes, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression remained unchanged. He looked to Chu Huanyu and said, &ldquo;You must&rsquo;ve never climbed to the Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; eighth step before, right?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Huanyu revealed an ugly expression. He had indeed never ascended to the Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; eighth step before. Not to mention the eighth step, he had never even managed to ascend to the seventh step. Chu Feng&rsquo;s words seemed to have struck his sore spot.<br>&ldquo;Just because you are incapable of ascending to the eighth step does not mean that I, Chu Feng, am incapable of ascending to the eighth step too,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are truly ignorant! In the history of our Chu Heavenly Clan, there has only been a single person that managed to ascend to the eighth step! That person is our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Old Ancestor!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you really think that you can ascend to the eighth step?! Do you really think that you&rsquo;re equal to our Old Ancestor?!&rdquo; Chu Huanyu burst forth in anger, and started to loudly lash out at Chu Feng.<br>Once he said those words, many of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations started to nod to indicate their approval of Chu Huanyu&rsquo;s claims. At the same time, they began to cast gazes of contempt at Chu Feng.<br>To compare oneself against their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Old Ancestor was most definitely overestimating one&rsquo;s capabilities, most definitely delusional.<br>Hearing what Chu Huanyu said, Chu Feng instead smiled faintly. He said, &ldquo;The way I see it, the ignorant one is you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What did you say?! You, some mere trash that has been exiled, dare call me ignorant?!&rdquo; Chu Huanyu&rsquo;s expression grew even angrier.<br>He was truly unable to understand how Chu Feng, some exiled trash, would have the courage to challenge him before all these people.<br>&ldquo;Earlier, you said that the eighth step of the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Step has only ever been reached by Old Ancestor himself. However, I can tell you this, there have been two other people who managed to ascend to the eighth step,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What? There have been two other people that managed to ascend to the eighth step?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who are they? How come I&rsquo;ve never heard of them before?&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the people of the younger generation present were immediately astonished. They had truly never heard of such a thing before.<br>Even Chu Huanyu was stunned. The reason for that was because&hellip; not even he had heard of this before.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine if you all do not know about this. I, Chu Feng, can tell you all who they are. Those two people were Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They are, respectively, my grandfather and my father,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. You are truly boasting too excessively, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truly ridiculous! I&rsquo;ve grown up in the Chu Heavenly Clan, how come I&rsquo;ve never heard of this matter?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ve never heard about this matter either. Chu Feng, you are truly capable of sticking gold on your face.&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, he immediately caused many people of the younger generation to laugh at and lash out at him. Furthermore, they were very serious as they lashed out at Chu Feng. After all, they had truly never heard of this matter before.<br>Right at that moment, Chu Xuanzhengfa shouted, &ldquo;All of you, shut up!&rdquo; Then, he said, &ldquo;What Chu Feng says is true.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens! It&rsquo;s actually real?! Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandfather and father managed to ascend to the eighth step of the Heavenly Lightning Steps?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that they managed to reach the same height as our Old Ancestor?!&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Xuanzhengfa said those words, many people of the younger generation present revealed astonished expressions.<br>They had truly never heard of this matter before. They had always felt that their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Old Ancestor was the only one who had ever managed to reach the eighth step. And now, they found out that Chu Feng&rsquo;s father and grandfather had also managed to reach the eighth step. With this, how could they not be astonished?<br>&ldquo;Actually, in the history of our Chu Heavenly Clan, only Old Ancestor himself managed to ascend to the eighth step,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa added.<br>&ldquo;What? Wasn&rsquo;t it said just earlier that Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandfather and father also managed to reach the eighth step? Why would Old Ancestor be the only one then?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Could it be that Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandfather and father managed to ascend to the eighth step, but were unable to stand firm? Or could it be that they only managed to reach the eighth step with one foot, and were unable to ascend completely? Thus, strictly speaking, they did not succeed?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, that must be the case. Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandfather and father definitely did not manage to successfully reach the eighth step.&rdquo;<br>When thinking of these possibilities, those people of the younger generation that disliked Chu Feng started to feel much more relieved. Furthermore, they also began to look to Chu Feng with mocking expressions in their eyes again.<br>They were all thinking in their hearts, &lsquo;The hell are you boasting about when they failed to successfully ascend to the eighth step? Although ascending to the seventh step is very powerful, it is two completely different things when compared to ascending the eighth step.&rsquo;<br>The people of the younger generation that did not know who Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan were were practically certain that they did not manage to successfully ascend to the Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; eighth step.<br>At the moment when they were verifying their own guesses in their hearts, Chu Xuanzhengfa looked to those younger generations and spoke again in a very loud and clear manner, &ldquo;Indeed, Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandfather and father are not on the list of people that reached Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; eighth step. The reason for that is because&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;... Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandfather and father ultimately ascended to the Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; ninth step.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s words came like a sudden clap of thunder. It shook all of the people of the younger generation present.<br>They were all stunned, and stood there with dumbfounded expressions. They simply did not dare to believe what they&rsquo;d just heard.<br>The Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; ninth step?<br>Would this mean&hellip;.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandfather and father had both surpassed their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Old Ancestor?!!<br><br><br></p></div>
