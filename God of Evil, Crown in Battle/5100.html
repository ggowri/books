        <h1>Chapter 5099</h1>
        <div>: Master&rsquo;s Help<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yator Upper Realm was one of the Upper Realms located in the vicinity of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. It was a realm directly under the rule of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>However, a monster had appeared in Yator Upper Realm. Terrifying black gaseous flames filled the sky with a malevolent aura, but its origin was from a small little body.<br>That person was none other than Prince Brightsun.<br>Prince Brightsun was currently on a rampage. His body was emanating strength far greater than his cultivation. He seemed to have lost consciousness, leaving behind just a streak of aggression within him.<br>It was fortunate that there was no one nearby, or else he would have gone on a slaughter given the bloodthirst coming from him,<br>All of a sudden, a humongous figure flitted across space and landed not too far away from Prince Brightsun. It was the Thousand Transformations Fox Demon and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s this rascal. Did he escape to this place using Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s formation? I never thought that his bloodline power would be this powerful, though his powers appear to have gone amok? It seems like Sima Xiangtu has left some kind of formation in him. I&rsquo;m guessing that he was intending to use this rascal&rsquo;s power to go on a massacre?<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d expect no less from Sima Xiangtu. He wants to drag the world down with him even if he loses his own life,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist remarked.<br>He did notice that there were multiple formations inscribed on Prince Brightsun long ago. Some of them were from the Asura World Spirit Army, but the rest were from Sima Xiangtu.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist didn&rsquo;t pay much heed to it back then, but their purpose was clear to him now. It was a formation that forced Prince Brightsun to go on a rampage should Sima Xiangtu ever lose his life.<br>And the power that Prince Brightsun was exerting right now would have been enough to slaughter the whole Nine Souls Galaxy under normal circumstances.<br>&ldquo;It looks like he has noticed us,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist remarked.<br>Prince Brightsun had locked his murderous eyes onto the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. Clearly, he was intending to make a move on the latter.<br>Grar!<br>A beastlike roar echoed from Prince Brightsun. At the same time, the black gaseous flames morphed into numerous massive black claws that swiped at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and the Thousand Transformations Fox Demon.<br>It looked like they were planning to tear the Ox-nosed Old Daoist into pieces.<br>&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo;<br>But with a mere harrumph, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist stopped the terrifying black gaseous flame in its tracks. Not only so, but even Prince Brightsun also appeared to have his movements sealed. No matter how he bared his teeth and growled, he was unable to move in the least.<br>Killing intent flashed across the eyes of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. He rose into the air and approached Prince Brightsun a step at a time.<br>Prince Brightsun started to panic despite his lack of consciousness, seemingly due to the intensity of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s killing intent. Surprisingly, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist didn&rsquo;t take his life right away.<br>&ldquo;It feels like a pity to kill you off just like that. Your existence might just be of help to that disciple of mine. Why don&rsquo;t you live on with that burning hatred of yours?&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist changed his mind. He placed his two palms together and started constructing a formation.<br>Weng!<br>There was a brilliant burst of light that was many times more intense than Prince Brightsun&rsquo;s black gaseous flame. It looked almost as if a new sun had suddenly risen in this realm, irradiating the surroundings with its brilliance.<br>Then, the formation started to contract on the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s hand till it was the size of a chicken&rsquo;s egg. The Ox-nosed Old Daoist smacked the formation into Prince Brightsun&rsquo;s head.<br>The next moment, the black gaseous flame receded into Prince Brightsun&rsquo;s body, and his terrifying eyes slowly reverted back to normal. By then, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and the Thousand Transformations Fox Demon had already vanished from sight.<br>&ldquo;What&hellip; happened earlier?&rdquo;<br>Prince Brightsun looked at his surroundings in confusion.<br>He did escape to this place through Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s formation, but for a moment there, he felt like he had entered a peculiar state. He couldn&rsquo;t tell whether what he had gone through earlier was real or that it was just a dream.<br>He suddenly thought of something, and a sharp glint flashed across his eyes.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you, Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Speaking those words with utmost hatred, Prince Brightsun rose to the sky and left the area.<br>Meanwhile, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was hidden inside the fabrics of space. When he saw Prince Brightsun depart with a hateful look on his face, a satisfied smile showed on his face. However, he soon turned around and looked behind him.<br>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you show yourself since you&rsquo;re already here?&rdquo;<br>Right after those words were spoken, the area where he was gazing at started distorting. Soon, a middle-aged man carrying an ax on his back walked out from the distortion. Despite the middle-aged man&rsquo;s ordinary appearance, he possessed unfathomable strength.<br>This was the person who forced the Netherworld Envoy to relinquish his hold on the terrifying little girl and send Chu Feng back to the Nine Souls Galaxy.<br>&ldquo;Should I be calling you the Woodcutter or Song Changsheng?&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.<br>&ldquo;Should I be calling you Dugu Lingtian or the Ox-nosed Old Daoist?&rdquo; the middle-aged man replied.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha! You&rsquo;re the only one in the current Eastern Region who dares to speak to me in such a manner!&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said with a chuckle.<br>The middle-aged man paid his words no heed. He looked in the direction where Prince Brightsun left and asked, &ldquo;Is it really good for you to have done that? That asura brat possesses a powerful bloodline power, but you planted a seed of hostility against Chu Feng in him. Aren&rsquo;t you afraid that he might really kill Chu Feng if he manages to mature?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What do you know? I wouldn&rsquo;t harm my own disciple. I&rsquo;m helping him here,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist snorted.<br>&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo;<br>The middle-aged man was led here by the aura emanated by Prince Brightsun, but since the matter had been resolved, he decided to turn around and leave.<br>&ldquo;Wait wait, don&rsquo;t be in such a hurry to leave,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Do you need me for anything?&rdquo; the middle-aged man asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried that my disciple might stray from the path thinking that I have been kidnapped by Sima Xiangtu. Help me send a letter to him,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist took out a letter and tossed it to the middle-aged man as he spoke.<br>&ldquo;You want me to mail your letter?&rdquo;<br>The middle-aged man received the letter with an irritated look on his face.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a small favor. At least do it on<br>that man<br>&rsquo;s account and make a trip for me, alright?&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>The middle-aged man&rsquo;s eyes widened as soon as he heard those words.<br>&ldquo;Is Chu Feng really his son?&rdquo; he asked.<br>&ldquo;You still don&rsquo;t know? All you have to do is to pop into the Ancestral Martial Galaxy to take a look, and you&rsquo;d have the answer to that question,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.<br>&ldquo;I promised him to never step into the Ancestral Martial Galaxy,&rdquo; the middle-aged man replied before leaving with the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s letter.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was assured to see that, knowing that the middle-aged man would do him that favor. He smiled to himself and murmured, &ldquo;Really. All I did was to snatch a treasure from you in that ancient remnant back then. Do you have to hold a grudge against me for so long?&rdquo;<br>He looked in the direction of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, God&rsquo;s Era has already started. We must both work hard. I hope that the two of us will reunite one day at the end of our cultivation paths.&rdquo;<br>With those words, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist got onto the back of the Thousand Transformations Fox Demon, and the latter rose into the sky and charged into space.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was traveling not through teleportation formations but space. From the direction of his travel, it was apparent that he was intending to leave the Eastern Region.<br></p></div>
