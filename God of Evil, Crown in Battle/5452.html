        <h1>Chapter 5452: The Despaired Jia Lingyi</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Long Muxi was surprised to hear those words. She hadn&rsquo;t expected Long Chengyu to recognize Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Despair surfaced on the faces of those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.</span><br><span>Who could have known that Chu Feng would be acquainted with not just Long Muxi but Long Chengyu too? It was evident from Long Chengyu&rsquo;s hearty laughter and bright grin that he was on good terms with Chu Feng.</span><br><span>In contrast to the crowd, Chu Feng was much calmer.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll concede that your identity surprised me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.</span><br><span>He naturally recognized the man before him too.</span><br><span>It was none other than the young man he had saved inside the forest where Miss Li Wu, the Black-feathered Specter, lived. The young man had initially talked to him with arrogance, to the point where Eggy thought of him as a fool.</span><br><span>Who could have known that he would actually be the famous Long Chengyu?</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother, you surprised me too. I would have never thought that you were acquainted with my big sister! I guess this is fate,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said with a chuckle. He then proceeded to send a voice transmission to Chu Feng. &ldquo;Brother, please keep our previous meeting a secret. I have a reputation to uphold, after all. It&rsquo;ll be embarrassing if others learn that I have such a history.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Rest assured,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied via voice transmission too.</span><br><span>Meanwhile, Long Kui walked up to Long Muxi and asked, &ldquo;Young miss, are you all right?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder Tian, I am fine,&rdquo; Long Muxi replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; Long Kui nodded.</span><br><span>His eyes suddenly turned cold as he turned around. A fist flew forth at an unbelievable speed and punctured Jia Lingyi&rsquo;s chest with hardly any resistance. The hand pulled out Jia Lingyi&rsquo;s heart and crushed it into bits.</span><br><span>While this strike wasn&rsquo;t enough to Jia Lingyi&rsquo;s life, it effectively crippled her. She began spewing blood nonstop as she crumbled feebly in mid-air.</span><br><span>Those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect remained deathly silent, not daring to utter a word at all. They showed none of the vivaciousness back when they were still insulting Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Rather, it was Long Muxi who nervously spoke up, &ldquo;Elder Tian, you mustn&rsquo;t kill her!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Rest assured, young miss. I&rsquo;m only teaching her a lesson. I won&rsquo;t take a life,&rdquo; Long Kui replied.</span><br><span>He then raised his head to look at Long Rui with even greater killing intent flaring from his eyes. Long Rui had already fallen to his knees, knowing that he was doomed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Long Rui, are you going to end it yourself or do I have to do it for you?&rdquo; Long Kui asked.</span><br><span>Long Rui slowly rose his feet and said, &ldquo;Milord, I deserve to die a thousand times over. I&rsquo;ll take my own life to repent for my crimes.&rdquo;</span><br><span>He then waved his sleeves, and the summoning formation vanished without a trace. The fact that he had chosen to dispel the summoning formation instead of ending his own life strongly suggested that Long Rui was going to make his escape.</span><br><span>Despite this, Long Kui calmly turned to Long Muxi and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, young miss. He can&rsquo;t escape.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Mmhm.&rdquo; Long Muxi nodded. &ldquo;Elder Tian, what brought you here?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Suqing sent a message to me,&rdquo; Long Kui replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;My aunt?&rdquo; Long Muxi was astonished to hear that. A thought surfaced in her mind.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder Tian, I suspect that my aunt might have met with some trouble. Please come with me for a moment.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Muxi began flitting toward the depths of Painter Mountain. Long Kui tossed out a delicate golden bowl with ten lifelike golden dragons inscribed on it before following Long Muxi.</span><br><span>The golden bowl emitted a flash of golden light in mid-air, and the ten golden dragons flew out with a furious roar. They coiled around the sky, forming a golden barrier. A powerful oppressive might specifically suppressed those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why does Miss Muxi address Lord Long Kui as Elder Tian?&rdquo; a confused person amidst the crowd asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Long Kui&rsquo;s full name is Long Kuitian. He once lost against a world spiritist in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion in his younger years, and the other party mocked him, saying that his name should be Long &lsquo;Tilling the Fields&rsquo; instead of Long Kuitian. The infuriated Lord Long Kui made a decision on the spot to remove the Tian from his name.</span><br><span>(Tian is the Chinese word for &lsquo;farming fields&rsquo;.)</span><br><span>&ldquo;As for why Miss Muxi continues to call him Elder Tian, it might be a habit of speech. It could be possible that the upper echelons of the Totem Dragon Clan still call him Elder Tian. However, I&rsquo;d recommend you not to address him by that name. Outsiders like us usually just call him Lord Long Kui. If, by any chance, you anger him by reminding him </span><span>of his humiliating past, you need not bear any expectations of him sparing your life,&rdquo; one of the elders explained.</span><br><span>Just then, the black aura from the All Lives Are Equal Palace started to recede.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>Shortly after the black aura receded, a pillar of light shot out of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s warship and pierced the barrier formed out of the ten golden dragons. It was a teleportation formation!</span><br><span>&ldquo;This feeling&hellip; Is it that woman?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng was startled.</span><br><span>The barrier formed out of the ten golden dragons quickly recovered after being pierced, but he still understood what the pillar of light represented. It was a teleportation formation, and it had just brought a person out of here.</span><br><span>His guess was that it was the woman who had fought with him earlier with her mysterious sword. In fact, he suspected that the woman might have been the one to release the black aura to attack the All Lives Are Equal Palace.</span><br><span>What further reinforced his conjecture was how the despair in Jia Lingyi&rsquo;s eyes deepened when she saw the black aura recede from the All Lives Are Equal Palace.</span><br><span>Soon, a person emerged from the All Lives Are Equal Palace. It was the World Spiritist Painter.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, are you all right?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The World Spiritist Painter rushed over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side. He didn&rsquo;t bother asking any questions since he was already aware of what had happened.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, I&rsquo;m fine. What about you?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The World Spiritist Painter had a pale face, and his body was trembling feebly. He appeared to have expended a lot of strength dealing with the black aura.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. It&rsquo;s a relief that Lord Suqing aided me in channeling the formation, or else I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to hold on. I didn&rsquo;t think that the culprit would help the Pill Dao Immortal Sect breach my formation to slow down the burning of the incense stick. That forced Miss Muxi to make a move in advance. Lord Suqing was too focused on helping me channel the formation that she couldn&rsquo;t keep a lookout here. I nearly caused both of your deaths.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The World Spiritist Painter hung his head in shame.</span><br></p></div>
