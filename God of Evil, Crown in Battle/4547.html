        <div>: Unforgivable<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve succeeded&hellip; I&rsquo;ve succeeded! Hahaha, I have managed to conquer it! I have managed to become an Utmost Exalted level cultivator!&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s eyes shot open as she leaped to her feet and cheered joyfully.<br>However, at the moment that she turned around to take a look, she suddenly froze in shock. She stared with her eyes widened and mouth agape.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip; This&hellip; What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi stared at Chu Feng in such great bewilderment that the joy on her face had vanished without a trace.<br>&ldquo;Why are you so surprised? Is my face that hard to recognize?&rdquo; Chu Feng teased.<br>&ldquo;Damn it, did I still fail in the end? Did I lose control of my cultivation and die? Or else how could you be standing before me?&rdquo;<br>The flustered Chu Lingxi fidgeted nervously as her mood grew lower and lower.<br>&ldquo;Silly lass, you succeeded! You managed to conquer our Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;s Bloodline Lotus. You&rsquo;re now a full-fledged Utmost Exalted level expert!&rdquo;<br>Gu Mingyuan stepped forward and gave Chu Lingxi a tight hug. The tears that were already glistening in her eyes finally flowed down in an outburst of emotions.<br>As a mother, it was her dearest hope that Chu Lingxi could surpass her and live a life greater than she did, and her wish had just come true.<br>&ldquo;Mother, am I&hellip; really not dreaming? Is this all real?&rdquo;<br>Feeling the warmth coming from her mother&rsquo;s embrace, the dazed Chu Lingxi realized that she wasn&rsquo;t dreaming.<br>&ldquo;Silly lass, of course it&rsquo;s all true! Chu Feng came here to participate in the tournament held by the Holy Light Clan too. He heard that we were here, so he came over to pay us a visit.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also thanks to his help that you were able to make such a smooth breakthrough. He used quite a bit of cultivation treasures in order to help you, so you should relay your thanks to him properly.&rdquo;<br>Gu Mingyuan wiped away her tears as she said to Chu Lingxi with a smile.<br>&ldquo;It was Chu Feng who helped me? No wonder! I was thinking why everything suddenly went so smoothly. I was clearly already on the verge of&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi knew just how close to death she came earlier in her cultivation. But just as she thought that it was all hopeless, everything suddenly calmed down as if it was just a false scare.<br>She had been perplexed about it all this while, which was also why she suspected that she might have died when she saw Chu Feng earlier. However, after hearing her mother&rsquo;s explanation, she finally understood what was going on.<br>It was all thanks to Chu Feng&rsquo;s help.<br>&ldquo;Aiyo, my little brother Chu Feng. It looks like you owe you another one,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said with a reluctant tone, as if she detested the idea of owing yet another favor to him.<br>But despite her words and tone of voice, she was unable to conceal the joy and excitement of seeing him here.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean by little brother? You should be calling me big brother,&rdquo; Chu Feng retorted.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean by big brother? You&rsquo;re obviously the younger one here,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi replied sharply.<br>&ldquo;In the world of cultivators, seniority is decided by one&rsquo;s cultivation level. You were the one who said those words yourself, so how can you renege on it now?&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed out.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall saying those words. I only know that I&rsquo;m the big sister and you&rsquo;re the little brother,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi insisted unreasonably.<br>&ldquo;Alright, the two of you should stop bickering with one another. We need to quickly get out of here. It&rsquo;ll be too late to escape once Lu Wantong gets here,&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan said anxiously.<br>Following that, she turned to Chu Feng and continued, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you came at a good time. I was still uncertain about the success of the plan, but now that you&rsquo;re here, I doubt that we&rsquo;ll face any troubles.&rdquo;<br>As she spoke, she took out a book from her bosom.<br>It was an old book with runes inscribed all over it. Every single page in this book was a talisman that harnessed an aspect of a formation. If one were to put all of the talismans in the book together, it would form a relatively powerful formation known as the teleportation formation.<br>However, what was unique about this teleportation formation was that it was driven not by spirit power but martial power.<br>&ldquo;Elder, you had Lingxi risk her life to cultivate using the lotus so that she could advance to Utmost Exalted level and activate this treasure together with you and escape from here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Gu Mingyuan.<br>The answer was already obvious enough now, but Chu Feng still wanted to verify the facts anyway.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t blame my mother for this. There&rsquo;s a reason for&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi was just about to explain the situation when Gu MIngyuan suddenly interjected sharply<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, Chu Feng already knows the situation we&rsquo;re in.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you know the situation we&rsquo;re in, the more you shouldn&rsquo;t blame my mother. I would rather die than to marry that Lu Wantong! Rather than to die in vain, I might as well gamble my life for a possibility to get away instead!&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>&ldquo;I have no intention of blaming your mother. Why would I do that? I&rsquo;m just infuriated at that Lu Wantong and Gu Yang. If I hadn&rsquo;t come here today, your future would have been ruined. I can&rsquo;t let the culprit, Gu Yang, get away after all he has done!&rdquo;<br>At this point, Chu Feng turned over to look at Gu Mingyuan and said, &ldquo;Elder, I have a request.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan asked.<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t spare Gu Yang after what he did. I want to kill him, and I hope that you won&rsquo;t stop me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you can&rsquo;t do it. Gu Yang is in cahoots with Lu Wantong now, and I can&rsquo;t allow you to offend Lu Wantong!&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Lu Wantong? Hmph! He&rsquo;ll suffer the same fate as Gu Yang too!&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, his robe began to flutter as his aura burst forth.<br>&ldquo;This aura&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Both Gu Mingyuan and Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s eyes widened in shock upon sensing the incredible power coming from Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, could it be that&hellip; you are at rank six Utmost Exalted level?&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan asked.<br>She had to ask that question because even she was unable to properly ascertain Chu Feng&rsquo;s current cultivation.<br>She had felt Lu Wantong&rsquo;s aura, and she knew that Lu Wantong was a rank five Utmost Exalted level cultivator. However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura was far stronger than that of Lu Wantong&rsquo;s.<br>For that reason, she guessed that Chu Feng might have already reached rank six Utmost Exalted level.<br>&ldquo;Yes, elder. I have indeed reached rank six Utmost Exalted level. There&rsquo;s no need for us to fear that Lu Wantong and run away anyway. What we should be doing is to settle the score for them. We should let them see the consequences of forcing my little sister Lingxi into an unwanted marriage!&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.<br>&ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t do. We should still leave. What&rsquo;s scary about Lu Wantong is not his cultivation but that massive network of connections behind him!<br>&ldquo;If it was on normal occasions, we could have still given it a try. However, due to the tournament hosted by the Holy Light Clan, all of the powers across the Holy Light Galaxy are now gathered here, and many of them are familiar with Lu Wantong.<br>&ldquo;Back then, when we first met Lu Wantong after stepping out of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formation, there were several elders standing behind him. While these elders didn&rsquo;t make a move, I could sense from their presence that their cultivation was above that of Lu Wantong&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<br>Gu Mingyuan didn&rsquo;t want to put Chu Feng through this danger.<br>&ldquo;Oh? The Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan actually found some reinforcement? Well, I sure would love to see just who is so brazen as to dare stand in my way!&rdquo;<br>It was then that a furious bellow sounded from outside the residence.<br>Glancing outside, Chu Feng could see that a huge army of people had arrived. They were floating in mid-air, gazing down on the residence.<br>These people were dressed in different uniforms, which revealed their different affiliations. There were only around several hundred people amongst them, but each of them stood tall and proudly, as if they were lofty deities standing before mere mortals.<br>If there was anyone amongst them who didn&rsquo;t fit in amongst the group, it would be indubitably Gu Yang.<br>As Chu Feng and the others had guessed, he had run off to report the matter, and he was the one who called these people here.<br>What was worthy of mentioning though was that Gu Yang was standing at the forefront of the group, beside an elder.<br>This elder wore an elaborate world spiritist cloak that pulsated with the power of a Dragon Mark Saint-level spirit power, revealing his identity as a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>However, compared to his extravagant world spiritist cloak, his looks were really sorely lacking. If one were to just look at his appearance&hellip; Well, it would be better not to do so.<br>One could still overlook his wrinkles and age spots since it was simply a common trait amongst the elderly. His puffy hair could also be tolerated since there were indeed people in the world who liked such a hairstyle.<br>But there was nothing that could possibly justify the long strands of hair hanging from his nostrils. Just the look of it was enough to make any ordinary human retch.<br>And when he spoke, his teeth, filled with yellow and black bits, really made one&rsquo;s stomach churn in disgust.<br>&ldquo;Is that fellow Lu Wantong?&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed to the elder as he asked Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi replied with a nod.<br>&ldquo;This Gu Yang really deserves to be killed a thousand times over!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could no longer repress his rage anymore as he stepped forth to face the crowd in the sky.<br>Had it been anyone else, Chu Feng might have still been able to tolerate it, but Gu Yang, for his own ambitions, actually tried to set Chu Lingxi up with such an old and hideous person.<br>This was unforgivable. He would make Gu Yang pay the price of his actions!<br></p></div>
