        <h1>Chapter 5110</h1>
        <div>: Unparalleled Honor<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Weng!<br>While everyone was astonished, there was a distortion in the sky not too far away. Numerous massive warships flying the flag of the Holy Light Clan came into appearance. They were filled with Holy Light Clansmen.<br>They were all dispatched here by Shengguang Xuanye to fawn on Chu Feng and construct new palaces for the Chu Heavenly Clan. Given their strength, they could easily build those palaces with a mere wave of their hands, but they dispatched outstanding construction workers and manually did the construction as a show of sincerity.<br>It was quite a tough job.<br>Later, they heard about the Darknight Sacred River in the Great Chiliocosm River, so they sent some people over to take a look. It was just that Shengguang Xuanye had sternly instructed them not to cause any trouble, so they refrained from showing themselves and instead observed the situation from a distance away.<br>However, when Shengguang Baimei and the others arrived at the scene, they couldn&rsquo;t possibly continue hiding in the shadows. Resounding voices echoed from the warships.<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to milord!&rdquo;<br>All of them kneeled on the deck of the warships and kowtowed to Shengguang Baimei and the others.<br>The appearance of the Holy Light Clan had already scared the crowd. After all, they were the overlords of the Holy Light Galaxy!<br>Yet, the Holy Light Clan was kneeling down and kowtowing to Shengguang Baimei and the others. That elucidated the crowd to their identity.<br>How could they not kneel to someone whom even the Holy Light Clansmen were kneeling to?<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to milord!&rdquo;<br>Everyone present kneeled down and kowtowed to Shengguang Baimei and the others. Under this atmosphere, even Gu Mingyuan was thinking to bow deeply as a show of respect. After all, it didn&rsquo;t make sense for her not to at least bow when even the Holy Light Clansmen were kneeling and kowtowing.<br>&ldquo;You may spare with the formality.&rdquo;<br>Before she could move, she received two voice transmissions. They were from Shengguang Baimei and Shengguang Buyu.<br>Needless to say, Gu Mingyuan wouldn&rsquo;t dare to oppose them. So, she glanced at Chu Lingxi and saw a complete absence of worry on the latter&rsquo;s face.<br>Chu Lingxi wasn&rsquo;t planning to bow at all. On the contrary, she was thoroughly enjoying the situation.<br>Gu Mingyuan could understand where she was coming from since the ones bowing included even the Holy Light Clan, and their reverence was directed toward where they were standing. This was unparalleled honor!<br>&ldquo;Is that really Chu Lingxi?&rdquo;<br>Amongst the crowd, Xia Yun&rsquo;er, Song Yunfei, Ghosteye Boy, Jian Wuqing, and the other juniors of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were secretly peeking at Chu Lingxi. They found it hard to believe that she was standing alongside all of those powerhouses.<br>Even though Chu Lingxi was a high and lofty young miss of the Chu Heavenly Clan in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm right from the start, her current standing far exceeded that. She was actually standing upright and enjoying the kowtows coming from the Holy Light Clan!<br>Meanwhile, Shengguang Baimei and the others didn&rsquo;t pay any heed to the Holy Light Clan. They had already noticed them, but their attention was focused on the Darknight Sacred River.<br>What they had to do now was to break open the Darknight Sacred River&rsquo;s seal.<br>Boom!<br>The three of them gathered their strength and unleashed their might on the Darknight Sacred River all at once. Their tremendous force generated huge ripples on the river, but before the crowd could see anything, a terrifying wave of killing intent suddenly swept in their direction.<br>That very moment, everyone thought that they were going to lose their lives.<br>However, Shengguang Baimei and the others quickly stepped in and stopped the shockwaves from rippling outward. They had already anticipated such a reaction and took countermeasures accordingly.<br>&ldquo;What kind of power is that? Is that<br>Utmost Exalted level?&rdquo;<br>The juniors of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm discussed amongst themselves. To them, an Utmost Exalted level cultivator was already like a god to them.<br>&ldquo;Peak Utmost Exalted level? You&rsquo;re underestimating those three. They are at peak Martial Exalted level at the very least.&rdquo;<br>The powerhouses present had a different guess.<br>The juniors from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm and Ancestral Martial Starfield turned pale upon hearing those words. Peak Martial Exalted level was a cultivation level utterly unthinkable to them.<br>Even Utmost Exalted level was already beyond their imagination, let alone Martial Exalted level!<br>To think that a day would come where they would get to witness the prowess of pinncle Martial Exalted level cultivators. This was unbelievable!<br>Putting aside Xia Yun&rsquo;er, Song Yunfei, Ghosteye Boy, Jian Wujing, Ren Xiaoyao, and the other juniors of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, even Long Ning, Kong Ci, Xian Yun, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er, and the others couldn&rsquo;t help but look at Chu Lingxi and Gu Mingyuan with complicated eyes.<br>&ldquo;Why are the two of them able to stand with such powerful people? Is it because of Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>The answer was already apparent in their minds, but that was also the reason why they couldn&rsquo;t hide their admiration and envy. It was one thing for Xia Yun&rsquo;er and the other juniors from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, but Long Ning and the others had never thought that the Chu Heavenly Clan was a big deal, let alone Chu Lingxi.<br>There was only one reason why Chu Lingxi and her mother were so highly valued by the Holy Light Clan, and that was Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng had brought this unparalleled glory to the Chu Heavenly Clan, allowing Chu Lingxi and her mother to stand in such an envied position.<br>While the juniors were feeling envious, the Golden Crane True Immortal, Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, and the other elders were feeling heartened. After all, they were the ones who bore high expectations of Chu Feng back then.<br>It was just that they never thought that Chu Feng would reach such great heights within such a short period of time.<br>&ldquo;Even the Holy Light Clan is fawning on Chu Feng now. I truly wonder how high Chu Feng will climb in the future!&rdquo;<br>They could no longer imagine the extent of Chu Feng&rsquo;s potential anymore.<br>Grar!<br>A jarring roar suddenly echoed from the Darknight Sacred River, and the surroundings started to tremble. The top experts were still able to stand their ground, but the weaker ones started toppling over like dominos.<br>In fact, the shaking was unbearable to quite a few people, such that they started bleeding from their seven apertures. Some even passed out straight away.<br>Everyone&rsquo;s face paled in horror.<br>There was a red aura pouring out from the Darknight Sacred River like a terrifying beast, and it was rushing at Shengguang Baimei and the others.<br>Shengguang Baimei and the others had already channeled their powers to their very limits, but they were still unable to fend against the red aura. From their warped expressions, it could be seen that they were under a great deal of pressure.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! How could there be such powerful energy in this remote place?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei cried out in regret.<br>He was the strongest one present in this place. If even he was unable to stop the red aura, he couldn&rsquo;t imagine what would happen to the rest.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is that lord unable to withstand that red aura too?&rdquo;<br>Everyone could tell from Shengguang Baimei and the others&rsquo; expressions that they were no match for the red aura. That renewed their understanding of the threat posed by the Darknight Sacred River.<br>Some of the more timid ones quickly got up and ran away, not wanting to get implicated in this fight.<br>&ldquo;This is bad. Those three lords are reaching their limits!&rdquo;<br>As the red aura pushed closer, Shengguang Baimei and the others started groaning in pain. It was clear that they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hold on much longer.<br>&ldquo;Elders, I&rsquo;m not too late, right?&rdquo;<br>It was then that a voice suddenly sounded out. A person appeared before everyone&rsquo;s eyes. It was a face that nearly everyone recognized.<br>It was none other than Chu Feng, the man who brought unparalleled glory to the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t late! Young hero Chu Feng, hurry up and make your move. I can&rsquo;t hold on much longer!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei was delighted to see Chu Feng, and he anxiously urged the latter to make a move. However, his words only left the crowd feeling confused.<br>They wondered if Shengguang Baimei was off his rockers. If even a peak Martial Exalted level cultivator like him was no match for the red aura, how could Chu Feng possibly stand a chance against it?<br>While the crowd was confused by the situation, Chu Feng flitted up to the red aura. He summoned the Lightning Mark and the Lightning Armor before raising his hand up high. Then, he smacked his palm down on the red aura.<br>Boom!<br>With a single strike, the red aura was immediately blasted off. Shockwaves rippled in all directions.<br>The crowd was plunged into silence.<br>They could clearly feel an aura from Chu Feng that surpassed even Shengguang Baimei's!<br></p></div>
