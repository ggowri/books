        <h1>Chapter 3393</h1>
        <div> - Scared Away<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Everyone, there&rsquo;s no need to panic. Although Chu Xuanyuan is indeed very powerful, this son of his is actually not that incredible.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have already fought him before. He&rsquo;s nothing more than a defeated contender,&rdquo; Tang Zhenghao spoke with a complacent expression on his face.<br>He actually knew very well that Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent was not lacking at all. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to defeat Li Anzhi.<br>However, it remained that Chu Feng had been defeated by him. As such, he would naturally want to manifest how strong he was.<br>&ldquo;Scram!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Wuma Shengjie was unable to contain herself. As she spoke, she planned to attack Tang Zhenghao and drive them out.<br>However, before she could unleash her oppressive might, a hand grabbed her wrist.<br>It was Chu Feng!!!<br>Chu Feng looked at Wuma Shengjie and shook his head to indicate to her to not involve herself in the matter.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to settle the debt between us,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Tang Zhenghao.<br>&ldquo;Haha. What a joke! You dare provoke me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Last time, had it not been for the fact that your Chu Heavenly Clansmen were present, I would&rsquo;ve already beaten the crap out of you. This time, there&rsquo;s no one to protect you.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s long hair began to flutter as he unleashed his aura.<br>Rank eight Heavenly Immortal.<br>After Tang Zhenghao unleashed his aura, the other six individuals looked at Chu Feng with sympathy in their eyes.<br>To them, rank eight Heavenly Immortal was a very powerful level of cultivation.<br>However, after sensing Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s cultivation, Wuma Shengjie had an expression of disappointment.<br>Indeed, rank eight Heavenly Immortal was very powerful. However, Wuma Shengjie knew very well that Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was that of a rank seven Martial Immortal.<br>A rank eight Heavenly Immortal against a rank seven Martial Immortal, the disparity between them was truly as vast as the heavens from the earth.<br>It was simply a match between a god and a mortal. They were simply not on the same level at all.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, were you really defeated by that sort of trash?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie asked.<br>&ldquo;Back then, my cultivation was lacking. I had indeed been defeated by him,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled in embarrassment.<br>&ldquo;When did that happen?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie asked.<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip; it was before I entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Hearing those words, Wuma Shengjie narrowed her brows.<br>Before Chu Feng entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, he was not even a match for a rank eight Heavenly Immortal. However, he was now already a rank seven Martial Immortal.<br>The speed at which his cultivation increased was simply too frightening. After all, it had only been several months, not even a year since the time he had entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>In such a short period of time, he actually managed to make successive breakthroughs to reach rank seven Martial Immortal.<br>This was nearly ten entire levels of cultivation. Such a breakthrough speed was simply too terrifying. Even she&hellip; felt astonished by it.<br>&ldquo;What bullshit are you two spouting? Which one wants to fight me first? Step forward,&rdquo; Tang Zhenghao spoke in a very displeased manner.<br>He had unleashed his aura with the intention to astonish his six lackeys and scare Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie.<br>However, not only were Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie not frightened in the slightest, but they were actually even looking down on him. This caused him to feel very displeased.<br>&ldquo;Say, Tang Zhenghao, you&rsquo;re truly disappointing. It&rsquo;s been so long, yet you&rsquo;re still only a rank eight Heavenly Immortal?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;A loser dares to look down on me? Today&hellip; I will beat you up till you call me granddaddy.&rdquo;<br>Tang Zhenghao was furious upon hearing those words. As he spoke, he unleashed his attack at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, why are you here?&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, another astonished voice was heard.<br>Upon hearing that voice, not only were the people beside Tang Zhenghao stunned, but even Tang Zhenghao hurriedly retrieved his aura and moved to the side.<br>Upon seeing the people that had entered, even Tang Zhenghao became afraid. He did not dare to provoke them.<br>The reason for that was because the people that had entered were respectively...<br>The fourth ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er.<br>The fifth ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Linghu Mingye.<br>The sixth ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Linghu Lun.<br>The seventh ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Mengyan Wushuang.<br>And the eighth ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Tongtian Yuanming.<br>Apart from them, there were also some people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan and the Tantai Heavenly Clan, as well as others that possessed decent relationships with those Ancestral Martial Decastars that had entered rat zodiac.<br>Like Tang Zhenghao, they were actually there to challenge Wuma Shengjie. After all, there were only twelve entrances in total. After considering things, they determined that choosing the rat zodiac&rsquo;s entrance was the most reliable one to pass.<br>Merely, Linghu Mingye and the others had never expected Chu Feng to be there.<br>After all, they were all people that had been defeated by Chu Feng. Even at that moment, they would never forget what Chu Feng had done to them in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>It could be said that Chu Feng had left an unerasable shadow in their hearts.<br>Just by seeing Chu Feng, they began to shiver involuntarily.<br>Tang Zhenghao and his lackeys simply had no idea what had happened in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>When those people came in, even Tang Zhenghao felt that the situation had turned bad. After all, in terms of pure martial power, he was no match for those people.<br>Seeing the surprised Mengyan Wushuang and Tongtian Yuanming, Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile, &ldquo;Oh my, what a coincidence to meet you all here. Mengyan Wushuang, Tongtian Yuanming, why did you two come in here? Could it be that you want to challenge me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eh, it&rsquo;s a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding. Brother Chu Feng, this is most definitely a misunderstanding.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I had known you were here, how would I have dared to come in here?&rdquo; Mengyan Wushuang shook his head repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo; Witnessing that scene, Tang Zhenghao and the others were all dumbstruck.<br>That Mengyan Wushuang possessed a cultivation above his. Furthermore, Tang Zhenghao had fought Mengyan Wushuang before. Thus, he knew very well how arrogant he was.<br>Thus, why would he be so flustered upon seeing Chu Feng? It was as if he was extremely afraid of Chu Feng, and had turned into a major coward.<br>&ldquo;Since you learned that I&rsquo;m in here, why aren&rsquo;t you scramming?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s tone suddenly turned stern.<br>&ldquo;He dares to speak to those people like that? Is that Chu Feng a fool?&rdquo;<br>Tang Zhenghao and his lackeys began to look at Chu Feng like a fool upon seeing such a thing.<br>However, the scene that happened afterward completely baffled them.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, please don&rsquo;t get angry. I&rsquo;ll leave immediately, I&rsquo;ll leave immediately.&rdquo;<br>Mengyan Wushuang began to bow to Chu Feng as he spoke. Then, he turned around and immediately disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ve only come in to check things out. If it displeases you, I&rsquo;ll leave immediately.&rdquo;<br>Following Mengyan Wushuang, Tongtian Yuanming also turned around to leave. Due to his enormous size and his flustered behavior, he actually hit a rock extending from the roof of the path, and tumbled to the ground.<br>However, he did not hesitate, and immediately ran out upon standing back up. His behavior was a prefect interpretation of &lsquo;fleeing in defeat.&rsquo;<br>Most shockingly, even Linghu Mingye turned around to leave.<br>At that moment, apart from the people that were there to enjoy the show, only Tantai Ming&rsquo;er and Linghu Lun remained.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? You want to have another go?&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Linghu Lun.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t you act overly arrogant. You&rsquo;d best not enter the grand formation this time around. If you enter it, I guarantee you that you will exit crying.&rdquo;<br>Linghu Lun coldly snorted and fiercely threatened Chu Feng. However, after he finished saying those words, he waved his sleeve and actually turned around to walk out.<br>At that moment, Tang Zhenghao and his lackeys were completely stupefied and dumbstruck.<br>That was because&hellip; no matter how they looked at it, those grand individuals seemed to have been scared away by Chu Feng...<br></p></div>
