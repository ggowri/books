        <h1>Chapter 5031</h1>
        <div>: You Have Underestimated Me Too<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;In view that you&rsquo;re a prodigy too, I&rsquo;ll give you a chance. As long as you serve me well, I&rsquo;ll turn a blind eye to your transgression. What do you think?&rdquo; Jiang Kongping said.<br>There was a lecherous smile as he said those words, and he even grabbed his crotch. His intention was made very clear here.<br>&ldquo;What is wrong with you?&rdquo; Chu Feng berated.<br>&ldquo;Well, this is what I enjoy,&rdquo; Jiang Kongping replied as he gestured to the dead men lying on the ground.<br>Chu Feng took a second glance and realized that there were lacerations on those men&rsquo;s nether regions too.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of beasts, but you&rsquo;re the first one that left me feeling utterly repulsed,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;You sure have the guts to say that to me. Now I&rsquo;m more determined than ever to make you submit to me. I&rsquo;ll show you what a true man is like!&rdquo;<br>Once again, Jiang Kongping formed a series of hand seals before pointing his finger at Chu Feng.<br>Whoosh!<br>Ferocious roars echoed from his body, but three tigers were manifested this time around. They swiftly spread out and encircled Chu Feng.<br>All of them moved at a much faster speed than before, and the strength they harnessed was much greater too.<br>&ldquo;Despicable. You were setting up this formation while you were talking to me!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could tell that this formation wasn&rsquo;t completed on a whim. Jiang Kongping must have been secretly constructing this formation while chatting with him, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to manifest three tigers at once.<br>He quickly constructed the same speed enhancement formation on his feet and leaped into the sky, attempting to dodge the aggression of the three tigers.<br>However, those three tigers had already sealed off all of his escape routes. One of them was even charging straight at him,<br>Chu Feng quickly manifested another spirit power sword and hacked it down on the approaching tiger.<br>Klang!<br>A jarring metallic sound echoed, and the spirit power sword was split into two. In contrast, the tiger remained completely unharmed.<br>The tiger opened its mouth wide and bit down on Chu Feng.<br>Pu!<br>Fresh blood splattered all over the ground.<br>Chu Feng was trapped in the tiger&rsquo;s mouth, unable to move at all. His body had been crushed by the tiger&rsquo;s jaws, causing blood to continuously flow from his wounds.<br>&ldquo;Your spirit power is formidable, but it looks like your mind is lacking. The prowess of your spirit power sword is much weaker than before. But even if it&rsquo;s as strong as before, all it&rsquo;ll do is make my tigers shed a bit of fur. You should be able to tell that my Wrathful Tiger Formation is much stronger now,&rdquo; Jiang Kongping scoffed.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>However, Chu Feng let out a cold sneer and turned to look at Jiang Kongping.<br>&ldquo;Why are you acting so arrogant when you haven&rsquo;t even won yet?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t won yet? It looks like you aren&rsquo;t going to admit defeat until you&rsquo;re at your deathbed. Very well, let&rsquo;s see how you&rsquo;ll deal with this then!&rdquo;<br>Viciousness flickered across Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s eyes as he flicked his finger. In response, the tiger clamped its jaws even tighter around Chu Feng.<br>Pu!<br>Under the immense force, Chu Feng exploded into a puddle of blood.<br>Jiang Kongping was astonished to see that. He had controlled the force exerted by the tiger to ensure that it wasn&rsquo;t enough to take Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.<br>&ldquo;That is&hellip;?&rdquo;<br>To his astonishment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s flesh and blood were still moving despite having exploded into bits. They turned into spirit power and converged in mid-air.<br>It turned out that it wasn&rsquo;t Chu Feng&rsquo;s real body!<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>Jiang Kongping realized that he had been tricked.<br>Pu!<br>The next moment, he felt a searing sensation in his chest. He lowered his head and saw that a spirit power sword had plunged into his chest. The culprit was none other than Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng was completely unscathed.<br>&ldquo;You made use of the opportunity while we were chatting to construct a substitution formation and sneak behind me?&rdquo; Jiang Kongping asked.<br>He had already guessed the truth, but he still wanted to verify his guess.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of asking when you have already figured it out?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with mocking laughter.<br>&ldquo;Despicable fellow. You resorted to underhanded means because you dare not to confront me head-on!&rdquo; Jiang Kongping roared angrily.<br>He was certain that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t a match for him. He felt that he had lost not because he was weaker but that he had gotten careless.<br>&ldquo;I admit that your formation is formidable, but a battle between world spiritists isn&rsquo;t just about whose formation is stronger. It&rsquo;s about utilizing each formation to its best. Surely you should understand that since you&rsquo;re a world spiritist yourself?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;If you wish to put it that way, I&rsquo;ll have no choice but to agree with you. Your control over formations is lacking in comparison to mine, but you do know how to put them to good use. You&rsquo;re indeed a formidable talent.<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, you still lost to me today. You should start preparing yourself to serve me!&rdquo;<br>As he said those words, a gleeful smile broke out on Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s face.<br>Sensing that something was amiss, Chu Feng quickly withdrew his spirit power sword and backed away, but as soon as he started moving, he felt a tremendous pressure that caused his speed to slow.<br>It was then that he realized that he was surrounded by Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s spirit power. This spirit power was denser than what was inside the Wrathful Tiger Formation.<br>Chu Feng quickly looked at his surroundings before widening his eyes in realization.<br>The sleeping chamber he was in turned out to be a formation itself. It was an imprisonment and slaughter formation. The powerful spirit power that was slowing his movement had come from it.<br>&ldquo;You constructed this formation in advance?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He could sense that the formidable might behind the formation, but such a formation couldn&rsquo;t have been set up in a short span of time.<br>&ldquo;You have discerning eyes. Indeed, it took me seven days in order to construct it. I acknowledge your means. If I have not prepared this hand in advance, I might have really lost to you due to my earlier carelessness.<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, you stepped into my territory, so you&rsquo;ll have to play by my rules. There&rsquo;s no way you could stand a chance against me inside my formation. You got careless and underestimated me. Did you think that I was trash that only knows how to frolic around? Think again!<br>&ldquo;Now, I shall teach you what a true man feels like! This is the price you&rsquo;ll have to pay for underestimating me.&rdquo;<br>Jiang Kongping licked his lips and began taking off his clothes.<br>&ldquo;Haa&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng knew what he was going to do next, but he wasn&rsquo;t intimidated at all. On the contrary, he let out a laugh.<br>&ldquo;I did underestimate you, but it seems like it goes both ways,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br></p></div>
