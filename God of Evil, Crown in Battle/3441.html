        <div> - Personally Kill Him<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;That old codger is the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Wuma Tao.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for that outstanding youth, he came together with Wuma Tao.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Likely, he should be the Prophesied Child from the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s eastern region, Wuma Shengjie,&rdquo; the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Wuma Shengjie?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the Gong Heavenly Clansmen&rsquo;s expressions all changed. When they looked to Wuma Shengjie again, their gazes were particularly bright.<br>After all, they had all heard of the title of &lsquo;Prophesied Child.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;How could someone like that Chu Feng know Wuma Shengjie?&rdquo; Gong Mingyue revealed a puzzled look.<br>At that moment, more and more bystanders had gathered. The Xu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Xu Yuan was beaten tragically by Wuma Shengjie. Unable to tolerate the pain, he was no longer arrogant and actually began to beg for forgiveness.<br>&ldquo;Stop beating me, stop beating me. I admit my mistake, I was wrong, okay?&rdquo;<br>Unfortunately for him, Wuma Shengjie acted as if she did not hear his pleas for forgiveness. Not only did she not have any intention to stop, but her beating became even more ruthless, making it so that Xu Yuan was unable to even beg for forgiveness anymore.<br>The bystanders were all dumbstruck. Wuma Shengjie was simply too ruthless.<br>As for the Xu Heavenly Clansmen, they were all shivering in fear, and did not even dare to utter a fart, much less plead for forgiveness for Xu Yuan.<br>At that moment, they were truly filled with regret. If they had known that such a malignant star, such a disaster, stood behind Chu Feng, they would not dare to provoke him even if they were given a hundred times the nerves.<br>Unfortunately, the deed was already done, and regret was useless.<br>They didn&rsquo;t know what they would be confronted with later.<br>They could only hope that there might be experts from their Xu Heavenly Clan or the Tantai Heavenly Clan that might pass through the area and rescue them.<br>Merely, that sort of coincidence would be very small. Even they did not hold much hope for that sort of thing to happen.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; right at that moment, a voice was heard.<br>To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, the person who had spoken was actually Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You can let him go,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, am I mishearing you? You want me to let him go?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie looked to Chu Feng with her eyes wide open. Evidently, she did not understand why Chu Feng wanted her to do that.<br>&ldquo;Let him go. If you beat him to death today, how am I going to personally kill him in the future?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Hearing those words, Wuma Shengjie understood Chu Feng&rsquo;s intention. She waved her sleeve and tossed Xu Yuan far away.<br>At that moment, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief also released his oppressive might. However, the anger on his face did not decrease in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;Xu Heavenly Clansmen, listen properly. This old man urges you all to behave yourselves. If you dare to create trouble for young friend Chu Feng again, our Wuma Heavenly Clan, even if we have to stake our entire clan&rsquo;s power, will make your Xu Heavenly Clan pay.&rdquo;<br>After the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief finished saying those words, he left together with Chu Feng and the others.<br>At that moment, only the astonished crowd remained.<br>They had not expected that the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would declare war on the Xu Heavenly Clan because of Chu Feng.<br>Not only were the bystanders confused, even Gong Mingyue, who was hidden in the shadows, was also completely confused. Thus, she turned to her grandfather. &ldquo;Grandfather, does the Wuma Heavenly Clan possess a very close relationship with the Chu Heavenly Clan? Why would they help Chu Feng like that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That old codger Wuma Tao is indeed a close friend of many years with the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. However, as the chief of a clan, he bares heavy responsibility to take care of his clan. As such, there shouldn&rsquo;t be a reason for him to risk the fate of his clan on an outsider.&rdquo; Even the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief felt very puzzled.<br>Suddenly, Gong Mingyue said, &ldquo;Grandfather, I am going to the Tantai Heavenly Clan to keep my appointment. Are you coming with me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is that the invitation for the gathering of the younger generations from Tantai Xing&rsquo;er?&rdquo; The Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Gong Mingyue said.<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I mention to you before that I had made an appointment with several close friends of mine?&rdquo; The Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;I know. I merely wanted to tell you that I cannot accompany you to meet those seniors,&rdquo; Gong Mingyue said.<br>&ldquo;You can go ahead and participate in your gathering. However, you must first find Lil Qing and take her there with you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No matter what, she&rsquo;s your little sister. When your little sister is lost and you&rsquo;re unable to find her, how could you have the mood to partake in a gathering?&rdquo; The Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;Grandfather, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about that. Although Lil Qing is someone that father has picked up, I have still grown up with her. I've always considered her as my own younger sister. I will definitely not disregard her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, I've already given her the invitation letter. With the invitation letter, she should be able to directly go and partake in the gathering,&rdquo; Gong Mingyue said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that you&rsquo;ve already found her? In that case, why did you let her run away again?&rdquo; The Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all because of that hedgehog that she raised. She went to the Ice Summit to seek out a Saint-cloak World Spiritist to help treat that hedgehog. That girl is simply indulging in fantasy. Ignoring the fact that those Saint-cloak World Spiritists weren&rsquo;t present, even if they were present, none of them would possibly be willing to see her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I criticized her about it, and she got angry and left. However, she had already agreed that she would participate in the gathering. Based on her personality, she will definitely be there.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, I will snatch her back,&rdquo; Gong Mingyue said.<br>&ldquo;Mn, don&rsquo;t let her run away again. Right now, people from all over the Ancestral Martial Starfield are gathered in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm. There are all sorts of people among them. Many of them are people that we cannot afford to offend.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You also know how headstrong Lil Qing is, thus she absolutely cannot be allowed to run all over the Nine Dragons Upper Realm by herself,&rdquo; the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Grandfather, you can rest assured. I understand,&rdquo; Gong Mingyue said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, in that case, we&rsquo;ll excuse ourselves,&rdquo; the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations spoke in unison. Evidently, they planned to accompany Gong Mingyue to the gathering of the younger generations.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief nodded. However, he soon added, &ldquo;Will the Xu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations also be participating in that gathering?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
