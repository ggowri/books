        <h1>Chapter 1880</h1>
        <div> - Incurable Disease<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&lsquo;You all&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Forget about it,&rdquo; Nangong Longjian sighed grudgingly. Then, he looked to Chu Feng and the Compass Immortal, &ldquo;I shall trouble the two of you then.&rdquo;<br>After Nangong Longjian finished saying those words, he sat down in a cross-legged position. Soon, a stream of black gaseous substance began to emit from his dantian. Like vines, the black gaseous substance rapidly spread through his entire body, covering it.<br>At the same time, Nangong Longjian&rsquo;s expression became increasingly ugly. In the end, the portion of his skin that had not been covered by the black gaseous substance had all turned paper pale like the skin of the dead.<br>&ldquo;Black Vines Soul Refining Body?!&rdquo; Seeing Nangong Longjian&rsquo;s current appearance, the Compass Immortal&rsquo;s expression took a huge change.<br>&ldquo;Black Vines Soul Refining Body? What is that?&rdquo; Bai Ruochen asked.<br>&ldquo;The Black Vines Soul Refining Body is a sort of innate disease. While it is capable of tempering the person who is afflicted with it, allowing them to become stronger than ordinary people, it will also snatch away that person&rsquo;s soul, causing him or her to die an untimely death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Black Vines Soul Refining Body is something that one is born with. It is hidden within one&rsquo;s dantian and mixed with one&rsquo;s source energy. Even if one were to separate from one&rsquo;s flesh and turn into a free consciousness, they would still not be able to break free from the Black Vines Soul Refining Body. The only way to break free from it is through death,&rdquo; The Compass Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, is this sickness curable?&rdquo; Bai Ruochen and Bai Suyan asked together.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very difficult. It can be retarded, but not eradicated. Furthermore, judging by Nangong Longjian&rsquo;s appearance, he should be at the terminal stage of the Black Vines Soul Refining Body. I&rsquo;m afraid&hellip; we will not even be able to slow it down,&rdquo; The Compass Immortal shook his head repeatedly. When he discovered that Nangong Longjian&rsquo;s illness was the Black Vines Soul Refining Body, he knew right away that he was powerless to help.<br>&ldquo;Compass Immortal, please save my father, please save my father,&rdquo; Bai Ruochen knelt to the Compass Immortal and began to plead with him. Her body was trembling in pain. The words of the Compass Immortal were equivalent to destroying her last bit of hope. She truly did not wish for her father to die.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, please get up. It is not that I do not want to save him, it&rsquo;s just that I am truly powerless,&rdquo; The Compass Immortal had an expression of helplessness.<br>At this moment, Nangong Longjian said with his weak voice, &ldquo;Ruochen, do not make things difficult for the Compass Immortal. This illness of mine is incurable.&rdquo;  Even though he was saying those words, Chu Feng could tell that he still held hope within his words. In the end, he wished that he could continue living.<br>This was not because Nangong Longjian was a coward that feared death. From his previous actions, it could be seen that he was not someone who sought fame or riches. Even in death, he wanted to pass his cultivation on to his daughter.<br>Thus, from this, it could be seen determined that the reason why he didn&rsquo;t want to die was none other than the love he possessed for family. By family, this did not mean the Nangong Imperial Clan. Instead, it was Bai Ruochen and her mother.<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;Senior Compass, I know of a method that might be able to treat senior Longjian&rsquo;s illness,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo;<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Hearing what Chu Feng said, the Compass Immortal, Nangong Longjian, Bai Suyan and Bai Ruochen all looked to him.<br>Although the four of them all asked different questions, they all expressed joy in their eyes. They knew that Chu Feng was not someone who would joke around at a time like this, nor was he someone that would make boastful claims.<br>&ldquo;I do not know about the Black Vines Soul Refining Body. However, I know of a spirit formation that specializes in curing innate diseases. It might be effective on the Black Vines Soul Refining Body,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, whatever method it might be, do tell,&rdquo; Compared to Nangong Longjian and the others, the Compass Immortal was even more interested. He had thought that Nangong Longjian&rsquo;s illness was incurable. Thus, he was extremely curious as to exactly what the method that Chu Feng spoke of was.<br>&ldquo;Senior Compass, I have never set up this formation before. Thus, I also do not possess a hundred percent certainty.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As senior Compass is very familiar with the Black Vines Soul Refining Body, I wish to have senior Compass take a look at whether or not the spirit formation might be feasible.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he began to write with his finger in midair. He was forming a diagram with spirit power.<br>The diagram was glistening with golden light and very dazzling. This was the diagram of the method to set up the spirit formation.<br>Chu Feng had outlined the entire process, as well as all of the materials needed for the spirit formation.<br>Merely, for a single diagram, Chu Feng took two entire hours just outlining it. From this, it could be seen how complicated that spirit formation was.<br>After Chu Feng finished outlining the diagram, not to mention Bai Suyan and Bai Ruochen, even Nangong Longjian, a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, was flabbergasted by it.<br>This diagram was too complicated. Even he was unable to make any sense of it. However, he was able to tell that it had not been casually or randomly drawn. Instead, it really was the outline of a spirit formation, a very powerful spirit formation.<br>When he saw the diagram, Nangong Longjian suddenly felt his blood rushing. Even the pain that he was feeling right now had been alleviated greatly. He had seen hope. From Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation diagram, he saw hope to be able to continue living.<br>At that moment, the Compass Immortal had an extremely serious expression on his face. His eyes were moving about through the diagram nonstop. He continued to survey it for six entire hours before finally stopping. Then, he turned to Chu Feng and spoke with a resounding and extremely emotional manner.<br>&ldquo;Amazing! That is simply too amazing! Little friend Chu Feng, exactly where did you obtain such an amazing spirit formation?&rdquo; The Compass Immortal asked with astonishment.<br>&ldquo;This formation was acquired from the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Nine Spirits Divine Diagram?&rdquo; The Compass Immortal was startled to hear those words. Then, he turned his gaze of disbelief to Chu Feng, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve managed to grasp the contents of the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram?&rdquo;<br>Truth be told, Chu Feng felt somewhat uneasy being looked at with such a gaze by the Compass Immortal. However, in the end, he still nodded.<br>&ldquo;Were you able to grasp it fully?&rdquo; The Compass Immortal asked again. His gaze became even more stern.<br>It was not only the Compass Immortal; even Nangong Longjian was looking at Chu Feng with an astonished expression. Evidently, he also knew of the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded again.<br>At that moment, the Compass Immortal grew silent. Even Nangong Longjian grew silent. It was only after a long while that the two of them managed to calm themselves. They looked to Chu Feng again with extremely marvelous expressions in their gazes.<br>&ldquo;No wonder, no wonder!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truly, no wonder!!!&rdquo; The Compass Immortal became extremely excited, and began to exclaim in admiration as he looked at Chu Feng. He said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you are truly no ordinary person. That Nine Spirits Divine Diagram has been in existence for so long, and ended up in the hands of countless people. While it was true that many of them managed to obtain great harvests from the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram, there has never been anyone who managed to completely grasp the contents of the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you know that even the creator of the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram, the Nine Spirits God, was unable to completely grasp the contents of the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram? That was why he made the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram before his death in the hopes that later generations would be able to completely grasp those lost spirit formations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, even after all these years have passed, even after the later generations tried all sorts of methods, none of them managed to grasp all of the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram&rsquo;s contents.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There was even someone who killed the nine Evil Spirits of the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram out of anger with the intention of destroying the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram. However, not long afterward, the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram reappeared in the world. Not only was the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram not destroyed, even the nine Evil Spirits that were killed were revived by the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Nine Spirits Divine Diagram is actually indestructible!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Nine Spirits Divine Diagram greatly surpassed what people expected it to be. Later on, a grand world spiritist declared that the Nine Spirits God had used all that he knew to create the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram before his death. That he had already greatly alleviated the difficulty of the spirit formations within the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if one wished to obtain the spirit formations within the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram, one must fuse together with the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram. As for that, it required an extremely powerful physique. It was something that no ordinary person could do.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected that you&rsquo;ve actually managed to accomplish it,&rdquo; The Compass Immortal looked to Chu Feng with a shocked expression. His gaze simply did not appear like the gaze of someone looking at another person. Rather, it was more like the gaze of someone looking at a god.<br>Chu Feng had accomplished something that was impossible for ordinary people. In the Compass Immortal&rsquo;s heart, Chu Feng was already akin to a god.<br>&ldquo;Wow, Chu Feng, it turns out that it was not all because of that Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor&rsquo;s strand of aura that you managed to obtain the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram&rsquo;s power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead, it was because you possessed a special body capable of withstanding the power of the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram. That was why you managed to grasp those spirit formations,&rdquo; Hearing what the Compass Immortal said, Eggy cried out in alarm.<br>Chu Feng was also extremely shocked. Like Eggy, he had thought that had had only managed to obtain the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram because of the assistance of Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor&rsquo;s strand of aura. It was only after hearing what the Compass Immortal said that he came to a sudden realization.<br>He now finally understood the true meaning behind what that Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor&rsquo;s strand of aura had said to him, &lsquo;your body is truly different from those of ordinary people.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Compass Immortal, in that case, do you think this spirit formation will be able to cure senior Longjian&rsquo;s illness?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>At that moment, Nangong Longjian, Bai Suyan and Bai Ruochen all looked to the Compass Immortal with extremely nervous expressions.<br>The Compass Immortal smiled lightly. Then, he said, &ldquo;Before this, I was indeed powerless to cure Nangong Longjian&rsquo;s illness.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, after obtaining this formation, I&rsquo;ve managed to see a trace of hope.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps we might be able to treat this illness after all.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
