        <h1>Chapter 4770</h1>
        <div>: Lord Sectmaster<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a simple move, but it showcased the formidable prowess of the Hidden Dragon Elders.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s instinct was spot-on. The power of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake might be enough to suppress Protector Qi, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to deal with the Hidden Dragon Elders.<br>This wasn&rsquo;t due to the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake&rsquo;s formation being weak but that Chu Feng was unable to fully control it due to the limits of his cultivation. After all, he was just a beneficiary of the formation and not the sect founder himself.<br>After severing the light rope, Li Fengxian tossed out yet another rope to tie Protector Qi up. He was really intending to drag Protector Qi over to the sectmaster to make him confess to his sins.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, seal off the barrier,&rdquo; Li Fengxian ordered.<br>Chu Feng quickly did as he was told and sealed off the barrier.<br>&ldquo;You should come with me as well,&rdquo; Li Fengxian said.<br>A surge of energy suddenly wrapped around Chu Feng&rsquo;s body before he was pulled uncontrollably toward Li Fengxian at an incredible speed. It took only the blink of an eye for the group to arrive at one of the forbidden grounds of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>It was the territory of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Wait here. Don&rsquo;t wander around.&rdquo;<br>Li Fengxian left Chu Feng in a gazebo by a lake before heading in with Nangong Chunyue and Protector Qi.<br>Not too long later, Li Fengxian returned alone.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you really able to control the energy in the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake as you wish now?&rdquo; Li Fengxian asked.<br>&ldquo;As long as I&rsquo;m within the vicinity of the lake, I&rsquo;d be able to do so,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;How did you manage to gain control over the lake? Explain the matter to me,&rdquo; Li Fengxian instructed.<br>Chu Feng quickly filled Li Fengxian in on what he had been through. In truth, he had undergone some trials after entering the depths of the seventh lake, and it was only after clearing them that he managed to gain control over the formation.<br>The black marks on Chu Feng&rsquo;s body that emanated the aura of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake was the key to the formation.<br>It was just that when Chu Feng wanted to head back to deal with Protector Qi, he somehow stumbled into the Vicious Beast Hellworld instead. The black marks suddenly lost control and released a vicious curse on him, threatening to take his life.<br>The abrupt turn of events confused Chu Feng, but he immediately took measures to resolve the crisis. He followed the steps on the stone tablet and overcame the trials in the Vicious Beast Hellworld. He managed to stabilize the black marks and neutralize the vicious curse through that, but he found that he was unable to tap into its powers anymore.<br>He instinctively understood that he had to activate the Cleansing in order to tap into the power of the black marks. He knew that triggering the Cleansing was dangerous, but he knew that there were huge benefits if he could successfully clear this trial too. So, he eventually went ahead with it.<br>Eventually, he cleared the illusion and successfully returned back to the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake. By then, he realized that he could use the black marks to control the energy in the lake.<br>He knew that he could use this energy to suppress Protector Qi, but he refrained from doing so right away because he needed eye-witnesses. That was also the reason why he intentionally caused a huge commotion to lure people over to the lake.<br>He waited patiently for Li Fengxian&rsquo;s arrival before finally handing the daoist robe over. He wanted to ensure that nothing would go wrong in the process, and Li Fengxian was the only one whom he knew was trustworthy here.<br>&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Li Fengxian gasped in astonishment upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s story.<br>Even someone of his standing found it hard to take in Chu Feng&rsquo;s story right away. The implications here were simply too great.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, can I trust that you haven&rsquo;t lied about anything in your story? You&rsquo;re a smart person, so you should know better than to mix in falsehoods into your story. There&rsquo;ll be severe consequences if we find that you have lied to us,&rdquo; Li Fengxian warned.<br>&ldquo;Lord Li, there&rsquo;s no falsehood in what I&rsquo;ve told you thus far,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;<br>Li Fengxian nodded in response before rising into the air. At the same time, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body floated upward and moved along with him. The two of them traveled at a speed so fast that Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t even make out their surroundings.<br>By the time Li Fengxian finally came to a halt, Chu Feng was already out of the sectmaster&rsquo;s territory.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve done well. It&rsquo;s just that this matter has grave implications, so we&rsquo;ll have to wait for the sectmaster&rsquo;s verdict. Remember, until the sectmaster finally gives her word, you aren&rsquo;t to use the power of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake anymore,&rdquo; Li Fengxian instructed.<br>&ldquo;Is the sectmaster unwilling to meet me?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng knew that Li Fengxian had brought him along so as to bring him before the sectmaster, but he was brought out before meeting her. This was likely to be an order from the sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Why? Are you hoping to meet the sectmaster?&rdquo; Li Fengxian chuckled.<br>&ldquo;As a disciple of the HIdden Dragon Martial Sect, there&rsquo;s no way I wouldn&rsquo;t be curious about the sectmaster,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>&ldquo;A disciple like you will definitely have a chance to meet the sectmaster in the future, so you need not worry about that. Alright, you ought to get going now,&rdquo; Li Fengxian said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be taking my leave then.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt a bit regretful since he was hoping to use this incident to win the sectmaster&rsquo;s goodwill, but since the sectmaster was unwilling to meet him, there was nothing he could do about it. In any case, he should have at least caught the sectmaster&rsquo;s attention with this.<br>After all, he accomplished something which even Dugu Lingtian failed to.<br>As long as the sectmaster was a smart person, she would surely treasure him.<br>Li Fengxian watched as Chu Feng headed off with a bright smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve long known that that lad is no ordinary person, but I didn&rsquo;t think that he would be this formidable. It looks like our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect has picked up a great treasure this time around,&rdquo; Li Fengxian remarked with a smile.<br>It was only after Chu Feng finally disappeared from his line of sight that he turned around to head back to the sectmaster&rsquo;s residence. However, before he could get moving, he suddenly recoiled in astonishment.<br>Unbeknownst to him, someone was standing behind him.<br>It was a beautiful middle-aged lady dressed in a dragon robe, standing with a dignified air. However, her eyes were freezing cold, making it hard for anyone to meet her gaze.<br>It was not coldness arising from distance but loftiness. Anyone who set their eyes on her would instinctively lower their heads deferentially. Her presence was so strong that it humbled even someone of Li Fengxian&rsquo;s standing.<br>Li Fengxian quickly bowed deeply and greeted, &ldquo;Paying respects to Lord Sectmaster!&rdquo;<br></p></div>
