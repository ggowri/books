        <h1>Chapter 3484</h1>
        <div> - Revealing One&rsquo;s Strength<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Am I mishearing things? Chu Feng wants to challenge Linghu Hongfei?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mad! This is absolute madness! How could anyone possibly challenge Linghu Hongfei?&rdquo;<br>The crowd felt disbelief at Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. They all felt that he was simply too reckless.<br>Even Tantai Xing&rsquo;er and the others, who were originally planning to begin their matches, were unable to keep themselves from stopping the surging martial power within their bodies to look at Chu Feng with expressions as if they were enjoying a show.<br>All of this was simply too unimaginable.<br>In fact, even Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others were surprised.<br>Although they knew that Chu Feng was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist and possessed power on par with a rank one Exalted, it was only rank one Exalted.<br>As for Linghu Hongfei, he was a rank two Exalted. How exactly was Chu Feng supposed to contend against him?<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you serious?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You really plan to challenge Linghu Hongfei?&rdquo; Even Wuming Ken questioned Chu Feng with a tone of uncertainty.<br>&ldquo;Milord, this junior is serious,&rdquo; Chu Feng answered.<br>&ldquo;I do not agree to it!!!&rdquo;<br>Right after Chu Feng&rsquo;s words left his mouth, another voice was heard.<br>After that voice was heard, the crowd all revealed complicated expressions. The reason for that was because the person who had spoken just then was the person standing on the same fighting stage as Chu Feng, Linghu Yueyue.<br>Linghu Yueyue was staring at Chu Feng with a displeased expression. Intense discontent filled her eyes. &ldquo;Chu Feng, if you want to challenge Linghu Hongfei, you must first pass through me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Miss Linghu, must you insist on this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Without determining a winner, do not think about leaving the fighting stage where I stand,&rdquo; Linghu Yueyue said.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, then Miss Linghu, please excuse my offense.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Chu Feng&rsquo;s words left his mouth, Linghu Yueyue fell powerlessly onto her butt with a &lsquo;putt.&rsquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd and even Linghu Yueyue herself were all stunned.<br>Without any prior indication, Linghu Yueyue was pushed to the ground by a burst of power. She was simply unable to resist that power at all. Although she was not injured, she was unable to even stand. That power had restricted her.<br>Then, when she saw that Chu Feng was actually looking at her with a smile that contained traces of ridicule, Linghu Yueyue was immediately enraged.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what sort of despicable trick did you use on me?!&rdquo; Linghu Yueyue shouted loudly.<br>It was not only Linghu Yueyue who was confused by what was happening, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er, Linghu Tiemian and all the other members of the younger generation present were also confused.<br>In fact, they had even thought that Linghu Yueyue had accidentally slipped and fell. It was only when she spoke so angrily that their attention shifted to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How did he accomplish that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could he knock Linghu Yueyue down so easily?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Linghu Yueyue is a rank seven Martial Immortal. Unless Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation has surpassed Linghu Yueyue&rsquo;s&hellip; it would be impossible for him to knock her down without anyone noticing at all.&rdquo;<br>Upon discovering that her situation might have been caused by Chu Feng, the crowd all felt disbelief. This was especially true for the people that knew Linghu Yueyue well, such as Linghu Tiemian, Linghu Mingye, and the other Linghu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s spirit power. That is spirit power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng has sealed Linghu Yueyue with his spirit power.&rdquo;<br>While the people of the younger generation were confused, a grand character of the older generation spoke to provide an explanation to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Saint-level spirit power. That is actually Saint-level spirit power. Chu Feng, at such a young age, is actually a Saint-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>Following that, someone else spoke in alarm. That person had discovered that Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power was Saint-level.<br>&lsquo;Sure enough,&rsquo; At that moment, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er revealed a slight frown.<br>Although she already knew that Chu Feng being a Saint-cloak World Spiritist would allow him to obtain power on par with the Exalted realm, she felt a greater threat from Chu Feng after witnessing his power for herself.<br>Exalted realm power. How was she supposed to contend against that?<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding. How could someone as young as that Chu Feng be a Saint-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Compared to becoming an Exalted realm expert, becoming a Saint-cloak World Spiritist is much more difficult.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are countless Exalted realm experts in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Yet, the total amount of Saint-cloak World Spiritists numbers only a few.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It should be impossible for him, a person of the younger generation, to reach Saint-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>The people that were unable to see through Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power felt that it was impossible for Chu Feng to be a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>&ldquo;Could that Chu Feng have used some sort of treasure?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars allows the usage of treasures, if one is to use very powerful treasures to defeat one&rsquo;s opponent, even if one is to obtain better performance records, one will not be acknowledged by anyone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It must be a treasure. If he had really used spirit power, why are we unable to see it? Isn&rsquo;t spirit power supposed to be even more dazzling than martial power?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have witnessed Saint-level spirit power before. It is truly extraordinary, and akin to a divine power. Before Saint-level spirit power, everything in the world will lose its radiance. As for that Chu Feng&hellip; I am unable to see his spirit power at all.&rdquo;<br>There were even people that felt that the power Chu Feng had released was done through the use of a treasure.<br>Their reactions were understandable. After all, Chu Feng had deliberately concealed the form of his spirit power. Those with insufficient strength would simply not be able to see the spirit power he had released. Naturally, they would think that the power he released was fishy.<br>Following that, there were even people that began to speak humiliating words towards Chu Feng. For example, there were the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>&ldquo;And here I was wondering how he suddenly became so powerful. Turns out, he was using a treasure. This guy is simply too despicable.&rdquo;<br>The Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations continued to insult Chu Feng unceasingly. They were itching to shout all sorts of curses and insults at him.<br>Merely, although they were insulting Chu Feng, they only dared to speak softly, and did not dare to make a racket.<br>Their behavior was simply that of despicable lowly people who would bully the weak and fear the strong.<br></p></div>
