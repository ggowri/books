        <h1>Chapter 4395</h1>
        <div>: The Lady Arrives<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Sectmaster Xu, if you really wish to kill him right now, you&rsquo;ll have to step across our dead bodies!&rdquo; the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea said.<br>The crowd was indubitably taken aback by the determination shown by the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea regarding this matter. Was there a need for them to really go this far for a stranger?<br>Even Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that they would do this for him, and he was surprised by the turn of events too.<br>That token was completely useless against the Soaring Flower Gazebo, but it was more than enough to convince Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea to turn against their own &lsquo;allies&rsquo; and put their lives on the line for him. This was far beyond his imagination.<br>Was this due to the strict discipline and faith of the Dao Sea?<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for me to trample over your bodies to take Chu Feng&rsquo;s life. Pardon me for the offense.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster released his oppressive might once more. Through fine control over his oppressive might, he morphed eight invisible hands that attempted to forcefully separate the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea from Chu Feng&rsquo;s side.<br>And without the sword formation to back them up anymore, the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea wasn&rsquo;t a match for the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster anymore.<br>Even without harming them, he was able to curb them with ease.<br>Weng!<br>But just as his oppressive might was about to reach the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea, a bizarre sight occurred&mdash;his oppressive might suddenly vanished into thin air!<br>This made everyone present, including the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster, to freeze in astonishment. Even the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea were taken aback too.<br>The eight of them could sense the pressure coming from the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster, and they understood his intention too. But they couldn&rsquo;t understand just how the oppressive might would just vanish into thin air.<br>&ldquo;Sectmaster Xu, you sure have grown audacious to dare lay your hands on my disciple!&rdquo;<br>It was at this moment that a voice suddenly boomed from the sky above.<br>Gazing the direction where the voice had come from, they saw a silhouette standing above the clouds. Her figure looked exceptionally small amidst the cluster of clouds, but when the crowd lay their gazes on her, they swiftly lowered their bodies deferentially.<br>It was a lady who appeared to be in her forties, and she had a very ordinary appearance. Compared to the ravishing beauty of the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea, one could even say that she was hideous.<br>Yet, no one dared to look down on this middle-aged woman.<br>That was because she was the renowned Lady of Dao Sea.<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to master.&rdquo;<br>As soon as the Lady of Dao Sea appeared, the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea bowed deeply to greet her.<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to the Lady of Dao Sea!&rdquo;<br>The others present, including the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster and the Sagacious Grandmaster&rsquo;s servant, Ordinary, also bowed their heads to greet her.<br>There was no one present who dared to disrespect the Lady of Dao Sea. Their attitudes were so deferential that it almost seemed as if they were mortals standing before a god.<br>&ldquo;So this is the Lady of Dao Sea, she&rsquo;s truly remarkable.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng also turned to look at the Lady of Dao Sea too. She had a very ordinary appearance but an unfathomable air around her. It wasn&rsquo;t just her strength that he was unable to see through, it felt that he couldn&rsquo;t even see through her as a person either.<br>This was a true expert cultivator!<br>After the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster greeted the Lady of Dao Sea, he hurriedly spoke up, &ldquo;Lady of Dao Sea, I don&rsquo;t mean any disrespect toward you or your disciples, but this man is simply too reprehensible. He&hellip;&rdquo;<br>He was afraid that the Lady of Dao Sea would misunderstand him, so he wanted to explain why he had made a move against Chu Feng. The fluster and fear on his face at this very moment was apparent for all to see.<br>Even though the world knew that their Soaring Flower Gazebo was on close terms with the Dao Sea, the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster knew himself that the Lady of Dao Sea was a lofty figure whom he could never hope to reach.<br>Rather than to say that they were allies, the Soaring Flower Gazebo was more like a subordinate power that was trying everything within its means to win the Lady of Dao Sea&rsquo;s favor.<br>He might appear to be with the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea, but he couldn&rsquo;t do the same with the Lady of Dao Sea. Even as years passed, the feeling of deference and danger he felt from the Lady of Dao Sea had never lessened in the least.<br>&ldquo;You need not say anything. I know what has happened. I&rsquo;ll give you an explanation here today,&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea said as she descended from the clouds.<br>Despite her ordinary appearance and lackluster disposition, she had an overwhelmingly powerful presence.<br>After the Lady of Dao Sea landed on the ground, she turned her sight to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Lad, you sure have guts to make the Soaring Flower Gazebo your enemy.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the nervous crowd from the Soaring Flower Gazebo finally heaved a sigh of relief. Some of them were even unable to stop smug smiles from forming on their lips.<br>Everyone thought that Chu Feng was finally going to meet his end.<br>One must know that the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster didn&rsquo;t even come close to matching the prowess of the Lady of Dao Sea. If she wanted to deal with Chu Feng, not even the Sagacious Grandmaster would be able to protect him.<br>Pu!<br>In the blink of an eye, a spurt of blood splattered across the air.<br>The Lady of Dao Sea had made her move. She manifested her martial power into a sword and pierced right into a person&rsquo;s dantian&mdash;the dantian of the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Everyone was completely flabbergasted by the move made by the Lady of Dao Sea. They had no idea what was going on at all.<br>&ldquo;Lady of Dao Sea, why&hellip; why would you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster widened his eyes in disbelief and indignance. Even as his dantian was impaled, he dared not to rage at the Lady of Dao Sea.<br>Shoosh!<br>Following that, the Lady of Dao Sea flung her robe, and an item flew out from her sleeves.<br>The item was extremely small at the start, but as it rose into the air, it swiftly grew larger and larger, to the point that it actually covered the entire sky.<br>At first sight, it would appear that there was nothing special about this item, but if one were to take a closer look, one would realize that there were countless heads hanging on top of the item.<br>They were the heads of the group from the Soaring Flower Gazebo. Be it whether they were disciples or elders, they were all hanging there at this instant.<br>&ldquo;My gosh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing such a sinister sight before them, even the toughest of cultivator present at the scene couldn&rsquo;t help but pale in fright.<br>Just by the sheer number of heads, it was no exaggeration to say that nearly everyone affiliated with the Soaring Flower Gazebo had been killed.<br>But why would the Lady of Dao Sea do something like this?<br>A possibility popped into the minds of the crowd at this moment&mdash;could it be that everything that Chu Feng had said was true?<br>Could the Soaring Flower Gazebo really be a demonic cult that committed all kinds of reprehensible deeds behind everyone&rsquo;s back while putting on a righteous front?<br>That would explain why the Lady of Dao Sea wanted to eliminate the Soaring Flower Gazebo.<br>&ldquo;Sectmaster Xu, you really shouldn&rsquo;t have let down my trust in you,&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea uttered coldly.<br>Those words were more than enough to allow everyone to figure out the truth.<br>It turned out that the Soaring Flower Gazebo was really such a reprehensible power, and that Chu Feng and Liu Shangwu hadn&rsquo;t lied at all!<br>&ldquo;Lady of Dao Sea, you&hellip; Please, I can explain. Let me explain&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster immediately knew that their deeds had been exposed, and his body began to tremble from sheer fear. He tried to explain himself in hopes of getting out of the situation.<br>Shoosh<br>But before he could finish his words, a dull rumble echoed in the air.<br>Following that, a rain of blood splattered all over the ground.<br>The body of the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster had exploded.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t just him. Everyone affiliated with the Soaring Flower Gazebo suddenly exploded apart at this instant, including the heads hanging on the item above.<br>A bloodied mess rained all over the ground.<br>Of course, while those from the Soaring Flower Gazebo had died, their items all fell into the hands of the Lady of Dao Sea.<br>Everything in the world seemed to fall silent in that instant. No one dared to say a word or even breathe loudly with such a horrifying sight right before them.<br>Even though the Lady of Dao Sea hadn&rsquo;t brought forward any incriminating evidence, there was no one who doubted the Lady of Dao Sea&rsquo;s words. They dared not to doubt it.<br>Just on the account that the Lady of Dao Sea had begun eradicating them, they immediately believed that the Soaring Flower Gazebo was a reprehensible demonic cult.<br>And despite everyone in the Soaring Flower Gazebo were massacred by the Lady of Dao Sea, no one thought that she was a cruel person. Instead, they felt that those from the Soaring Flower Gazebo deserved to die.<br>This was simply the credibility that came with wielding great power. She did more than to instill fear in others. She was able to shape the view of others with just her actions, and she could easily convince others that she was right.<br></p></div>
