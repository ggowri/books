        <div>: Failed Plan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Due to the barrier, only those who possess our Holy Light Bloodline are able to access the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium. Young hero Chu Feng and Elder Niantian, you&rsquo;ll need these in order to enter the premises. It&rsquo;s just that we have a limited number of these, so we can only afford to grant them to our most esteemed guests.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei took out two jade tokens that contained a formation that seemed to be from the same origin as the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium.<br>&ldquo;Due to certain restrictions by the formation, we can only have a person accompanying you into the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium. Young hero Chu Feng and Elder Niantian, I can only walk you till here.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Niantian, Elder Buyu will be accompanying you. As for young hero Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll have Xintian to escort you. It should be more comfortable for you to have someone of your age with you,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>He handed the jade tokens to Chu Feng and Daoist Niantian.<br>The rest of the crowd also consciously backed off as well, as if there was some kind of rule concerning this. As a result, the only one left by Chu Feng&rsquo;s side was Shengguang Xintian.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, choose carefully. Don&rsquo;t waste this precious opportunity,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said with a smile.<br>He placed the jade token onto his dantian, and it immediately passed through his clothes and body to enter his dantian.<br>Weng!<br>The next moment, his body emanated a brilliant glow. A formation had formed from his body. It wasn&rsquo;t too large, barely enough to cover him and Shengguang Buyu.<br>The crowd turned their eyes toward the wooden gate and saw that it was emanating spirit power as well. The spirit power had converged together to form a small spirit formation gate.<br>Above the spirit formation gate were the following words:<br>Welcome to our Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium, esteemed guest. You may freely choose any manual within.<br>When those words appeared, Daoist Niantian and Shengguang Buyu rose up simultaneously and entered the spirit formation gate. Shortly after they entered, the spirit formation gate and the spirit power vanished without a trace.<br>With their disappearance, everything reverted back to normal.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you just have to place the jade token on your dantian, just like what Elder Niantian did,&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian reminded.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me big brother. It sounds off-putting. Call me Chu Feng instead,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;But I want to call you big brother. Why are you shy? You have even hugged me before. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m asking you to marry me,&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian spoke with a mischievous smile.<br>It was clear that she was teasing Chu Feng here, and those words hinted at her intimate interaction with Chu Feng.<br>The crowd couldn&rsquo;t help but look at Chu Feng.<br>Shengguang Qianyu shot a thumbs up to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re an incredible person.&rdquo;<br>He discovered a newfound respect for Chu Feng.<br>Despite Shengguang Xintian&rsquo;s rowdy personality, she had never been touched by a man before. Yet, Chu Feng was actually able to embrace Shengguang Xintian when he had only arrived in the Holy Valley moments ago. Not to mention, Shengguang Xintian&rsquo;s proactive attitude made it clear that she was interested in Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip; Haa, it looks like I&rsquo;ve gotten myself into trouble,&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke with a helpless tone.<br>His helplessness was feigned. How could something as trivial as this possibly give him a headache? There was even a period of time where he believed that he should take advantage of everything that came his way.<br>He quickly placed the jade token against his clothes.<br>Weng!<br>The jade token swiftly seeped through his clothes and entered his dantian. The next moment, it morphed into a formation which expanded out from his dantian, covering his entire body and Shengguang Xintian.<br>Following that, a spirit formation gate and several words appeared on the wooden gate of the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium.<br>&ldquo;Woah! Surely not?&rdquo; Shengguang Qianyu exclaimed upon seeing the words.<br>The others also revealed looks of shock.<br>Even Shengguang Shishen and Shengguang Baimei widened their mouths in shock.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re incredible! There are always surprises no matter where you go.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xintian grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm and praised him while trying to snuggle up to him.<br>Chu Feng ignored Shengguang Xintian and stared intently at the words above the spirit formation gate.<br>Welcome to our Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium, esteemed guest. You may freely choose any three manuals within.<br>He swiftly figured the reason why everyone was reacting in such a manner was because he was allowed to choose three manuals. After all, Daoist Niantian was limited to only choosing one.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re truly a spectacular individual. There have been thirteen esteemed guests who have entered our Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium ever since its founding, but you&rsquo;re the first one who has been allowed to obtain three manuals,&rdquo; Shengguang Shishen said.<br>Those words affirmed Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess.<br>&ldquo;Three manuals? That sounds good.&rdquo;<br>With a chuckle, Chu Feng rose into the air and entered the spirit formation gate together with Shengguang Xintian.<br>Weng!<br>The spirit formation gate closed, and everything reverted back to normal.<br>However, the shocked looks on the crowd showed no signs of disappearing.<br>&ldquo;What a monster. If not Chu Feng, I would have thought that all guests were allowed to retrieve only a single martial skill manual from our Holy Light Martial Arts Compendium. It turns out that&hellip; it&rsquo;s actually possible to take out more<br>&ldquo;Not to mention, Chu Feng was actually able to pick three. That&rsquo;s two more than everyone else! Could it be that the formation of our Holy Light Martial Arts Compendium has noticed something?&rdquo; Shengguang Shishen remarked.<br>&ldquo;Old man Baimei, do you finally know what kind of person you tried to kill earlier on? It&rsquo;s fortunate that Chu Feng was magnanimous enough to forgive you, or else it would have brought a calamity upon our Holy Valley!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Shishen shot an accusatory glare at Shengguang Baimei.<br>&ldquo;Ey, I know that I&rsquo;ve made a fatal error here, Shengguang Shishen. There&rsquo;s no need for you to put me down any more than this.&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei replied with a helpless tone.<br>He wouldn&rsquo;t have made such a decision had he known this in advance. He looked at the distant sky and commented wistfully.<br>&ldquo;I thought that our Holy Valley would be invincible in the Holy Light Galaxy once we emerge from our seclusion. We were still intending to annex the Nine Souls Galaxy and unite the Eastern Region of the huge world of cultivation.<br>&ldquo;Yet, even before we could even cross blows with the Nine Souls Galaxy, such a formidable individual has already appeared in our Holy Light Galaxy. It looks like our Holy Valley still has a long way to go&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The other members of the Holy Valley also sighed softly, especially Shengguang Shishen.<br>The Holy Valley had gone into seclusion for so long that the outer world knew very little about it. They were planning to stun the world with their overwhelming prowess and unite the Eastern Region in a single swoop, but it looked like they had to alter their plans now.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s truly bizarre. Why would a prodigy of Chu Feng&rsquo;s caliber not induce any holy light phenomenon in the Holy Light Ancient Formation?&rdquo; Shengguang Qianyu murmured as he turned his eyes toward the Holy Light Ancient Formation.<br>Those words piqued the intrigue of the elders.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s aptitude had already been proven by the Holy Lotus Tree and their reaction from the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium. Yet, why would the Holy Light Ancient Formation not show the slightest phenomenon to reflect that then?<br></p></div>
