        <div> - The Witch Miaomiao<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Really? Quickly, let me have a look,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao extended her hand with the intent to receive the insect from Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Be careful, this little thing here is quite remarkable. I exhausted a great amount of effort to capture it. Furthermore, it is very crafty,&rdquo; Chu Feng warned.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I got it. Quickly, give it to me, give it to me,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao said with an extremely impatient expression.<br>Feeling helpless, Chu Feng ended up handing the little red insect to Xian Miaomiao.<br>Chu Feng noticed that, at the moment when he handed the little red insect to Xian Miaomiao, the little red insect was looking at him with a complacent smile on its face. It was as if it was telling Chu Feng &lsquo;Little guy, fight against me? You&rsquo;re still too inexperienced.&rsquo;<br>After receiving the little red insect, Xian Miaomiao asked curiously, &ldquo;Chu Feng, did it recognize you as its father?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Recognize my ass. That little thing is not a newborn. I ended up being toyed with by it for a very long time,&rdquo; Chu Feng complained.<br>&ldquo;Haha, it&rsquo;s this interesting?&rdquo; After hearing what Chu Feng said, Xian Miaomiao became even more excited. She then looked to the little red insect and said, &ldquo;Are you male or female?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Beauty, I am a female,&rdquo; The little red insect said in a slightly shy manner. Its tone was extremely soft and gentle.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Royal Spirit Insect?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao asked.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; The little red insect nodded obediently.<br>&ldquo;Continue to act. I shall see how long you can continue to act,&rdquo; Seeing that the little red insect was actually that obedient in Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s hand, Chu Feng was unable to contain himself from feeling disdain toward it. He knew extremely well how vile that little thing was.<br>Fortunately, it was a female. If it was a male, Chu Feng would not have handed it to Xian Miaomiao. That shameless little thing, if it was a male, it might end up doing extremely shameless things.<br>&ldquo;Then, do you have a name?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao continued to ask.<br>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; The little red insect nodded.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao asked.<br>&ldquo;I am called Shit,&rdquo; The little red insect said in a very proud manner.<br>[1. Technically, its name is Lashi; aka. To shit.]<br>&ldquo;Pff,&rdquo; Hearing that word, Chu Feng who was drinking water directly sprayed out a mouthful of water. He looked to that little red bug with an astonished expression. He thought to himself that that name was truly crappy.<br>&ldquo;Shit, who the heck gave it that name? Hahahaha. Aiya, I can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m dying from laughter.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Her Lady Queen was holding onto her stomach and bending her knees whilst laughing in Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit space. She had the appearance of nearly dying from laughter.<br>&ldquo;Shit?&rdquo; At that moment, Xian Miaomiao started to frown. She started to have an uncomfortable expression.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, my name&rsquo;s Shit. It&rsquo;s the Shit as in shitting out feces. Isn&rsquo;t my name awesome? My dad said that my name is most definitely the most amazing name in the world,&rdquo; The little red insect said in an extremely proud manner. It seemed to not have realized what was wrong with its name at all. Instead, it was extremely proud of its name.<br>&ldquo;No, that name is extremely bad. I&rsquo;ll give you a new name,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao said.<br>&ldquo;New name? Are you saying that you&rsquo;re able to give me a name even more amazing than the one my dad gave me?&rdquo; The little red insect asked.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re a world spiritist. Help me think of a name,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Just call it Lil&rsquo; Red,&rdquo; Chu Feng said in an extremely casual manner.<br>&ldquo;Mn, Lil&rsquo; Red, this name&rsquo;s pretty good. It&rsquo;s simple and easy to remember. At the same time, it suits you very well. Your name will be Lil&rsquo; Red,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao said.<br>&ldquo;What? Lil&rsquo; Red? You&rsquo;re actually giving me such a simple name? No, I&rsquo;m not going to be Lil&rsquo; Red. My name will be Shit,&rdquo; However, the little red insect strongly protested the name Chu Feng had thought of.<br>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t be called Shit. You don&rsquo;t know how vulgar that name is. It&rsquo;s better that your name be Lil&rsquo; Red. C&rsquo;mon, be obedient,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao said.<br>&ldquo;No, my name is Shit, Shit is my name. I&rsquo;m Shit, I&rsquo;m Shit,&rdquo; The little red insect began to shout hysterically.<br>&ldquo;You actually dare to talk back to me? Watch as I teach you a lesson,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao curled her lips and then revealed an ill-intended smile. Then, she grabbed the little red insect with her hands. With one hand on its head and the other on its tail, she began to pull on its body.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo; In an instant, that little red insect that was only a finger length long was pulled to over a meter long.<br>&ldquo;Ahhh! Noo! Heavens, help me! You&rsquo;re about to pull me into a thin noodle, even though I don&rsquo;t know what noodles are!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Aiyah, I was wrong! I will not be Shit anymore! My name will be Lil&rsquo; Red, I&rsquo;ll be Lil&rsquo; Red!&rdquo; That little red insect was truly useless. After being tormented by Xian Miaomiao, it immediately accepted the name of Lil&rsquo; Red.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha, Chu Feng, quickly, look, Lil&rsquo; Red is so flexible. No matter how hard I pull her, she will not break. This is truly amazing,&rdquo; At that moment, Xian Miaomiao was in great joy as she played around with Lil&rsquo; Red. Even though Lil&rsquo; Red was begging for forgiveness, she still had no intention of stopping. She completely ignored Lil&rsquo; Red&rsquo;s cries.<br>&ldquo;Great sir, quickly save me! Save me from this witch&rsquo;s grasp!&rdquo; Powerless to do anything else, the little red insect actually began to cry to Chu Feng for help.<br>&ldquo;Haha,&rdquo; Faced with the little red insect&rsquo;s cries for help, Chu Feng recalled the complacent expression it had when it managed to break away from his hand.<br>Thus, not only did Chu Feng not plead for leniency for it, he instead said to Xian Miaomiao, &ldquo;Miaomiao, since you like Lil&rsquo; Red so much, I&rsquo;ll give it to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I belong to great sir, I do not belong to the witch.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Great sir, I beg of you, do not give me to the witch. I still haven&rsquo;t lived enough. I am still only a child,&rdquo; Hearing those words, before Xian Miaomiao could reply, the little red insect began to voice its refusal.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you serious?&rdquo; At that moment, Xian Miaomiao was extremely overjoyed.<br>&ldquo;Of course. If you like it, then it&rsquo;s yours,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Sure, sure! I like it a lot. This Lil&rsquo; Red is simply so fun to play with,&rdquo; As Xian Miaomiao said those words, she pulled Lil&rsquo; Red again. She was truly planning to pull Lil&rsquo; Red apart.<br>&ldquo;Mom, grandpa, uncles, aunts, come and save me!&rdquo; Lil&rsquo; Red&rsquo;s miserable voice resonated nonstop. Resonating with its voice was Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s delightful laughter.<br>Xian Miaomiao continued to play with Lil&rsquo; Red for a long while before she finally began to search for Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Flowers with Chu Feng again. However, even on their way to find the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Flowers, she would continue to play with Lil&rsquo; Red.<br>Seeing how tragically Xian Miaomiao was playing with Lil&rsquo; Red, Chu Feng did not feel the slightest bit of sympathy for Lil&rsquo; Red. Instead, he felt that she was truly suitable to be Lil&rsquo; Red&rsquo;s master. At the very least, he felt her to be a much more fitting master than himself.<br>Suddenly, Lil&rsquo; Red who was being tormented by Xian MIaomiao said, &ldquo;Wait a moment, stop messing with me. As long as you stop messing with me, I&rsquo;ll help you two search for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Flowers,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Flowers? You know of them?&rdquo; Hearing those words, both Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao revealed dubious gazes. The two of them did not believe that crafty little thing.<br>&ldquo;I do, I really do. I know where the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Flowers are. As long as you release me, I&rsquo;ll bring you two there to find them,&rdquo; Lil&rsquo; Red said.<br>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; Red, you know what the consequences will be should you lie to me, right?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao said with a beaming smile on her face. However, to Lil&rsquo; Red, Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s sweet smile was extremely frightening.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare, I don&rsquo;t dare,&rdquo; At that moment, even though Lil&rsquo; Red was an insect, it was sweating cold bullets out of fear of Xian Miaomiao.<br></p></div>
