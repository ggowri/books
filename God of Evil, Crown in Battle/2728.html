        <div> - Entering The Immortal Armament Armory<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Naturally. Furthermore, there have been quite a few of them too,&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, has anyone managed to obtain an Immortal Armament from the Immortal Armament Armory?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master laughed out loud. It was a very profound laughter.<br>Just like that, he continued to laugh for a long time before finally stopping. &ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, your question is right on point.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are indeed quite a lot of people that have entered the Immortal Armament Armory. However, never has there been a single person that managed to retrieve a weapon from it. Not to mention Immortal Armaments, no one was even able to retrieve an Incomplete Immortal Armament.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In other words, there has never been anyone that managed to make any weapon in the Immortal Armament Armory react in resonance,&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>After those words were heard, the crowd present all revealed relieved expressions.<br>They actually already knew that those who chose to enter the Immortal Armament Armory had all returned empty-handed.<br>In fact, there was a rumor that the Immortal Armament Armory was a scam.<br>Thus, over the years, very few people would choose to enter the Immortal Armament Armory.<br>Take Chu Xianshuo, for example. He had obtained first place in the hunt for nine years in a row. However, never once did he choose to enter the Immortal Armament Armory.<br>Originally, the crowd were afraid that Chu Feng would not understand the situation regarding the Immortal Armament Armory and be scammed by it.<br>After all, even though the crowd knew about the Immortal Armament Armory, no one would dare to warn Chu Feng before the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master.<br>However now, the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master had personally declared the history of the Immortal Armament Armory to Chu Feng.<br>This caused the crowd to feel relieved. They felt that as long as one was sensible, one would be able to learn from one&rsquo;s predecessors&rsquo; mistakes, and choose not to enter the Immortal Armament Armory.<br>However, right at that moment, with a smile on his face, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, I choose to enter the Immortal Armament Armory.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He actually chose to enter the Immortal Armament Armory?! Am I mishearing things?!&rdquo;<br>The crowd was astonished. Their astonishment was understandable. It was not a sensible act to choose to enter the Immortal Armament Armory after learning of the mistakes of one&rsquo;s predecessors.<br>However, when they saw Chu Feng&rsquo;s determined appearance, the crowd realized that they had not misheard.<br>It turned out that Chu Feng was an insensible individual.<br>However, upon thinking about it, the crowd once again felt relieved.<br>If Chu Feng were sensible, he wouldn&rsquo;t have humiliated the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations in the hunting ground like he had.<br>If Chu Feng were sensible, he wouldn&rsquo;t have accepted Chu Xianshuo&rsquo;s, a rank four True Immortal&rsquo;s, challenge with his cultivation of a rank two True Immortal.<br>If Chu Feng was sensible, the people present would not have known that Chu Feng was such a demon-level genius.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, if you are to choose to enter the Immortal Armament Armory, you will not be able to obtain this Dragon Phoenix Silver Stream.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, if no weapon in the Immortal Armament Armory is to resonate with you, you will return empty-handed,&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master warned Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Villa Master, you have already warned me about all that earlier,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, it seems that little friend Chu Feng has already decided. Since that&rsquo;s the case, I will be putting this Dragon Phoenix Silver Stream away.&rdquo;<br>After the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said those words, he placed the Dragon Phoenix Silver Stream back into his Cosmos Sack. At the same time, he took out an item from his Cosmos Sack.<br>It was a watery ball-like object.<br>That&rsquo;s right, when seeing it with his naked eye at such a close distance, it was simply a ball of water to Chu Feng.<br>That crystal ball was the size of a hen&rsquo;s egg. Thus, Chu Feng was able to clearly see that there was a palace within the crystal ball. That palace was somewhat peculiar. Its construction resembled a long corridor that was split into two levels.<br>Furthermore, the walls of the palace seemed to be made of glass. Thus, the palace was transparent.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng was able to see the situation inside the palace. It was densely packed with over ten thousand weapons placed inside the palace.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master squeezed apart the water ball. After that, he raised his arm.<br>&ldquo;Splash~~~&rdquo;<br>Like a reverse waterfall, water soared into the sky. However, the water did not fall back down. Instead, it formed a small-scale lake in midair.<br>It was a floating lake. As for that palace, it was floating on top of the lake. Furthermore, it began to rapidly increase in size.<br>Soon, it turned into a grand and imposing palace.<br>When the palace increased in size, Chu Feng was able to clearly see that there were three large characters written on the entrance of the palace - Immortal Armament Armory.<br>Furthermore, after the palace increased in size, those weapons also became clear to the viewers.<br>There were blades, swords, spears, whips and rods.<br>Apart from those ordinary-looking weapons, there were also other items. For example, there were jade pendants, bracelets and even eating bowls and drinking jugs.<br>In short, items of all shapes, sizes and appearances were present there. However, without a doubt, all of those were weapons.<br>The Immortal Armament Armory was separated into two levels.<br>The first level had a lot more weapons. There were over ten thousand weapons. They were all Incomplete Immortal Armaments. Furthermore, there were weapons of all qualities. Not all of them were top quality weapons.<br>As for the second level, the number of weapons there were much fewer, roughly a thousand. However, the weapons on the second level all emitted extraordinary airs. They were simply incomparable to the weapons from the first level. Practically every single one of them was emitting the airs of a ruler.<br>Naturally, those weapons were all Immortal Armaments.<br>However, Chu Feng noticed that both the first level&rsquo;s Incomplete Immortal Armaments and the second level&rsquo;s Immortal Armaments were all fake.<br>Not only were those weapons fake, but even the Immortal Armament Armory itself was fake.<br>It was formed by some sort of special spirit formation. It was merely an image. However, it was no ordinary image.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, go on ahead.&rdquo;<br>As the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master spoke, he waved his sleeve, and the entrance to the Immortal Armament Armory opened up.<br>Chu Feng did not hesitate. He directly soared into the sky and arrived before the entrance of the Immortal Armament Villa. Then, he entered it.<br>At that moment, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all became serious. That vast sea of people went completely silent. It was so silent that the crowd&rsquo;s heartbeats and breaths could be heard.<br>Even though there had never been anyone who could successfully cause a weapon in the Immortal Armament Armory to resonate...<br>Even though people had concluded the Immortal Armament Armory to be a scam...<br>After Chu Feng entered the Immortal Armament Armory, they were still unable to contain themselves from letting out gazes of anticipation.<br>After all, compared to the people before, Chu Feng was much more talented.<br>He was a demon-level genius.<br>Thus, the crowd was looking forward to Chu Feng. They hoped that Chu Feng would be able to cause the weapons to resonate.<br>Finally, Chu Feng entered the first level of the Immortal Armament Armory. He had completely entered the Immortal Armament Armory.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Buzz, buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Buzz, buzz, buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Chu Feng entered the Immortal Armament Armory, trembling sounds began to resonate from the Immortal Armament Armory.<br>Furthermore, the further in Chu Feng walked, the stronger the trembling sounds became.<br>The next moment, all the weapons on the first level of the Immortal Armament Armory started to tremble violently.<br>Their trembling was simply too strong. The weapons began to collide with one another and started emitting ear-piercing sounds.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Am I dreaming?!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, many people did not dare to believe their eyes.<br>In the past, when people had entered the Immortal Armament Armory, not only did the weapons not move in the slightest, but there was absolutely no sound from them.<br>Yet, after Chu Feng entered the Immortal Armament Armory, all of the weapons started to tremble violently.<br>This could only mean one thing. They had started to resonate in response to Chu Feng&rsquo;s presence.<br>Furthermore, it was not merely one or two weapons that were resonating. Instead, all of the weapons on the first level started to resonate.<br><br><br></p></div>
