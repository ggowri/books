        <div> - Return Of The Overlord<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was due to a single item that the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were so nervous -- the letter that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief held in his hand.<br>That letter had been delivered by the old man wearing the purple-gold gown who'd just left.<br>It was a special invitation letter.<br>The reason that letter was special was because only the overlord of a starfield was qualified to receive the invitation.<br>Those invitation letters indicated that it was not only the Chu Heavenly Clan that received such a letter, but all the strongest powers of the other starfields would have received an invitation letter as well.<br>However, the Ancestral Martial Starfield was one of the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s Ten Abandoned Starfields, the ten weakest starfields amongst the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s ninety-six starfields.<br>As the Ten Abandoned Starfields were too weak, they were not even qualified to participate in the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s grand occasions. That was also the reason they were known as the &lsquo;abandoned&rsquo; starfields.<br>As such, the fact that the Ancestral Martial Starfield had received the invitation letter indicated that the other overlords of the ten 'Abandoned' Starfields had also received invitation letters.<br>If the letter was for a grand occasion, it would only be a grand occasion for the Ten Abandoned Starfields.<br>Logically, since the Ten Abandoned Starfields were all roughly of equal power, it was not much for them to be gathered together.<br>Furthermore, there had been many gatherings between them before.<br>Otherwise, the All-heaven Sect and the other four powers wouldn&rsquo;t have become allies.<br>Nevertheless, the Chu Heavenly Clan still felt enormous pressure.<br>The reason for that was wholly because they were simply too weak.<br>Whilst they were the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, they were not the strongest in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>The reason they were able to become the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s overlord was wholly because it was the desire of the Three Cities.<br>Being supported by the Three Cities meant that even if there were people that were dissatisfied with them being the overlord, they could only keep their dissatisfaction in their hearts; no one dared to voice their thoughts.<br>However, things would be different if they were to leave the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Those powerful existences would not worry about that at all.<br>If they looked down on them, they would definitely express it. If the Chu Heavenly Clan decided to participate, they would definitely be looked down on.<br>That was the reason why the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were frowning so heavily.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, are we not able to refuse?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa asked all of a sudden.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that wouldn&rsquo;t do. Lord Clan Chief agreed to participate earlier,&rdquo; said Chu Hanpeng.<br>&ldquo;Are we not allowed to back out just because we agreed to it?&rdquo; asked Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>&ldquo;Back out? That&rsquo;s an invitation letter from the Purple Star Hall.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we refuse to participate, it would be equivalent to not giving the Purple Star Hall face.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We cannot even afford to offend the other starfields. How can we possibly afford to offend the Purple Star Hall?&rdquo;<br>Chu Hanpeng had a helpless look on his face as he said those words.<br>Hearing Chu Hanpeng&rsquo;s words, Chu Xuanzhengfa lowered his head.<br>What sort of existence was the Purple Star Hall?<br>They were also the overlord of a starfield.<br>The old man in the purple-gold gown from before was from the Purple Star Hall.<br>That said, the Purple Star Hall was not from the Ten Abandoned Starfields.<br>Rather, they were the overlord of a Lower Starfield.<br>Although they were only the overlord of a Lower Starfield, they were absolutely not people that the Abandoned Starfields could compare to.<br>As such, the Purple Star Hall possessed strength surpassing all the Abandoned Starfields.<br>Even without Chu Hanpeng telling him that, Chu Xuanzhengfa knew that they could not afford to offend the Purple Star Hall.<br>The only reason he didn&rsquo;t want to participate in the grand occasion was because he didn&rsquo;t want their Lord Clan Chief to be humiliated.<br>As such, whilst the grand occasion might be a gathering for the other starfields, it might be nothing more than a Feast at Swan Goose Gate for the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>[1. Feast at Swan Goose Gate / Hongmen Banquet&rarr; a banquet set up with the aim of murdering a guest. Referring to Xiang Yu&rsquo;s attempt to kill Liu Bang.]<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, you&rsquo;re a very busy individual, it is better that I keep the appointment on your behalf.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Xuanzhengfa raised his head and looked to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>He didn&rsquo;t wish for the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to be humiliated and, since they could not refuse to participate. To be humiliated in their Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s stead, became the only suggestion he could think of.<br>However, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief smiled and waved his hand at Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s proposal. &ldquo;Zhengfa, I appreciate your intention. However, this is something that this old man must personally attend to.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, Lord Clan Chief, you&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa still wanted to dissuade him.<br>&ldquo;Zhengfa, you must also know that this grand occasion is bad for our Chu Heavenly Clan, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, have you thought of why it is only bad to our Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; asked the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because our Chu Heavenly Clan is the weakest.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The world of martial cultivators is a world where the weak are prey to the strong. That has been the principle since ancient times,&rdquo; said Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Insufficient strength, that is the main reason.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With the strength that our Chu Heavenly Clan possesses, we are indeed unqualified to become a starfield&rsquo;s overlord. All of us present know that very well.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, even if our Chu Heavenly Clan does not possess sufficient strength, we must still have integrity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since this old man has accepted the task of managing the Ancestral Martial Starfield before the masters of the Three Cities, I must shoulder the responsibilities that come with it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man cannot only enjoy the respect and reverence of my position. I must also shoulder all the responsibilities that come with being the overlord of a starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, how can I hide?&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief swept his gaze across the people present as he said those words.<br>All the elders lowered their heads silently.<br>None of them were able to find grounds to refuse their Lord Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, in that case, allow me to accompany you,&rdquo; said Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll consider it.&rdquo;<br>After saying that, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief put the invitation letter away.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elders&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Elders, this is bad!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, an elder rushed in and immediately knelt on the ground.<br>His face was completely pale and he was covered in sweat. Even his clasped hands trembled slightly.<br>It was as if he had received an enormous scare.<br>&ldquo;What scandalous behavior! What are you making a fuss about?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fortunately, Lord Envoy left. Otherwise, you&rsquo;d have thoroughly disgraced our Chu Heavenly Clan!&rdquo;<br>The people present were already very agitated to begin with. As such, the appearance of the messenger immediately provoked their ire. A few people immediately started to angrily denounce the messenger.<br>Of course, it was not only because they were upset. There was another reason.<br>That reason would be the fact that that elder was simply in too much of a panic.<br>Their Chu Heavenly Clan was already no longer the same as before.<br>With the protection of the Three Cities, practically no one would dare to cause trouble for them.<br>Who would possibly dare to oppose them?<br>That was the reason why someone had denounced the elder for making a fuss about nothing.<br>That said, even though he was denounced by the elders, the panicked appearance of the elder did not change in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;It-it-it&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s the Star-star-starfield Master Realm, th-they&rsquo;ve returned.&rdquo;<br>The elder was so scared that he even stuttered.<br>&ldquo;Starfield Master Realm?!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, even Chu Xuanzhengfa and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s expressions changed.<br>&ldquo;You mean to say that the Wuming Clan has returned?&rdquo; asked the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Right. F-f-furthermore, t-they&rsquo;re r-ri-right o-outside t-the entrance of our C-Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve come fier-fiercely. I... I think that t-they&rsquo;re n-no-not here with k-kind intentions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, Lord E-elders, p-please go l-look.&rdquo;<br>That elder was about to cry as he spoke.<br>He was truly terrified.<br>In fact, he was no longer the only person terrified at that moment.<br>The elders that had denounced him earlier about making a fuss about nothing were also shivering in fear.<br>In fact, even the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Chu Xuanzhengfa had ugly looks on their faces.<br></p></div>
