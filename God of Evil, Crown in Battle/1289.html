        <div> - Parting<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;The three of us must help too? Could it be that having two Royal-cloak World Spiritists is still not enough?&rdquo; Sima Ying was astonished to hear what Bai Suyan said. She could not understand exactly what sort of help Chu Feng, Bai Ruochen and herself could provide.<br>&ldquo;Of course, to have one more person helping means getting this done a bit faster. Even if the speed would only increase by a tiny bit, it would still be faster.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, this Boundary Energy is not something that is easy to break apart,&rdquo; Bai Suyan said with a smile on her face.<br>&ldquo;Very well, this will also allow us to understand how to set up a formation capable of breaking the Boundary Energy,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Okay then,&rdquo; After hearing what Chu Feng said, Sima Ying nodded her head. At the same time, Bai Ruochen also walked over to them.<br>Following that, Chu Feng, Sima Ying and Bai Ruochen began to assist Bai Suyan and Half Martial Emperor White Ape, two Royal-cloaked World Spiritists, in setting up the formation to break apart the Boundary Energy that separated the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>With the combined effort of the five individuals, after three entire days&rsquo; worth of time, they finally managed to open a tunnel less than three meters in diameter in the Boundary Energy that covered both the earth and the sky.<br>At that moment, Bai Ruochen and Half Martial Emperor White Ape&rsquo;s complexions both turned somewhat pale. During these past three days, the two of them had exhausted quite a significant amount of spirit energy and paid quite a considerable price to open the tunnel.<br>From this, one could tell how difficult it was to break apart this Boundary Energy. Even for Royal-cloaked World Spiritists, it was not something that they could accomplish with ease.<br>&ldquo;Quickly go through, this Boundary Energy will soon restore itself to its original state,&rdquo; Half Martial Emperor White Ape said to Chu Feng with a smile on his face. Even though he said those words with ease, there was a trace of a reluctance to part on his aged face.<br>&ldquo;Elder White Ape, thank you for all that you&rsquo;ve done for us this time. Chu Feng will never forget the help that you provided for the rest of his life,&rdquo; Chu Feng cupped his fist respectfully and bowed to Half Martial Emperor White Ape.<br>Although Half Martial Emperor White Ape had not been present when people had been deliberately making things difficult for Chu Feng in the Cyanwood Mountain, once Half Martial Emperor White Ape returned, he had helped Chu Feng greatly. At the very least, he made all those who had bullied and humiliated Chu Feng pay a price for their actions. Thus, Chu Feng was grateful to Half Martial Emperor White Ape from the bottom of his heart.<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, we are family. Since we are family, there&rsquo;s no need for you to say those kinds of words that regard me as an outsider.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After you finish journeying outside, return to check out the Cyanwood Mountain. The Cyanwood Mountain will forever be your home,&rdquo; Half Martial Emperor White Ape had a very kind expression on his face. He appeared like a senior sending off a junior that was leaving to experience the world.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; At this time, Bai Suyan also began to urge Chu Feng.<br>Seeing this, Chu Feng bowed respectfully to Half Martial Emperor White Ape again before turning around and stepping into the tunnel in the Boundary Energy.<br>Not long after they stepped through the tunnel, the Boundary Energy began to gradually heal. In merely a short moment, the tunnel was completely sealed and the Boundary Energy returned to how it was before.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng was no longer able to see Half Martial Emperor White Ape. To be precise, he could no longer see the Cyanwood Domain. The only thing he could see in the direction of the Cyanwood Domain was the multi-colored and magnificent Boundary Energy.<br>Turning his body around, what appeared before Chu Feng&rsquo;s line of sight was a brand new world. This was the Alliance Domain led by the World Spiritist Alliance.<br>Suddenly, Bai Ruochen asked, &ldquo;Chu Feng, do you plan to go to the World Spiritist Alliance?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded his head. However, he soon discovered that Bai Ruochen&rsquo;s state of mind seemed to be somewhat abnormal. Thus, he hurriedly asked, &ldquo;Ruochen, do you not plan to journey together with us?&rdquo;<br>Hearing what Chu Feng said, Bai Ruochen&rsquo;s body shivered slightly. She did not respond and instead turned her gaze to her mother.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, Miss Sima, Ruochen and I still have things that we must do. The two of us do not plan to stay in the World Spiritist Alliance. I fear that we will have to bid our farewells here,&rdquo; Bai Suyan replied with a smile. Compared to Bai Ruochen, she was very calm.<br>Chu Feng was actually not surprised by what Bai Suyan said. He knew from the very beginning that Bai Ruochen possessed an extraordinary identity.<br>Especially after Bai Suyan took away the mysterious item from the Ascension Sect, leaving it in devastation but also saving it from a future calamity, Chu Feng became aware that Bai Suyan and Bai Ruochen, this daughter and mother pair, were people who possessed secrets. Generally, people like them would always carry a heavy burden with them wherever they went.<br>Thus, Chu Feng knew that it was impossible for Bai Ruochen to remain in the Cyanwood Domain, as that place was nothing more than a temporary stop for her.<br>However, even though Chu Feng knew that Bai Ruochen would not return, he still asked her, &ldquo;Do you still plan to return to the Cyanwood Mountain?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Most likely not,&rdquo; Bai Ruochen shook her head. On her face was a slight expression of reluctance to part.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng felt somewhat sad. Since his arrival in the Holy Land of Martialism, Bai Ruochen could be said to have been his first true friend.<br>A friend who had gone through trials and tribulations and shared both delights and hardships with him. Although Bai Ruochen was a female and was oftentimes uncommunicative, the friendship between them was very deep and pure.<br>Now that he would have to part with her and didn&rsquo;t even know if he would see her again in the future, Chu Feng naturally felt reluctance in his heart.<br>While separations brought sadness, Chu Feng had already gotten used to it. Thus, he soon adjusted his state of mind and smiled brightly.<br>He said to Bai Ruochen, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. Although the Holy Land of Martialism is very large, if fate would bring us together again in the future, then, regardless of when it might be, you will forever be my junior sister Bai, our Asura Division&rsquo;s second head.&rdquo;<br>Seeing how optimistic Chu Feng was, Bai Ruochen felt a lot more relieved. She said, &ldquo;That would be the best.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Well then, little friend Chu Feng, Miss Sima, Ruochen and I will be leaving now. As for the two of you, go to the World Spiritist Alliance properly. Make sure to not cause trouble on your journey there.&rdquo;<br>After Bai Suyan warned them with a smile, she flew into the sky with Bai Ruochen and soon disappeared into the distant horizon. No one knew where this pair of daughter and mother were planning to go.<br>&ldquo;Sigh, never would I have imagined that Bai Ruochen would be leaving like this. Here I was thinking that the three of us would be able to return to the World Spiritist Alliance together.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although her world spirit techniques are inferior to yours, she is still a rare genius. If she were to train in the World Spiritist Alliance, it would definitely be very beneficial to her,&rdquo; As Sima Ying looked in the direction that Bai Ruochen and her mother had left in, she shook her head in a regretful manner.<br>&ldquo;There is no such thing as a banquet that lasts forever. Parting is always inevitable,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled, at ease. He then said, &ldquo;Sima Ying, you should know about the road to return to the World Spiritist Alliance, right?&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to be expected. This lady here grew up in the World Spiritist Alliance, how could I not know where it is?&rdquo;<br>Sima Ying wiped her nose with her thumb in a witty manner and then started to lead the way for Chu Feng. As for Chu Feng, he followed behind her. The two of them began to journey alongside one another, chatting and laughing.<br>Actually, Chu Feng was able to directly proceed to the place that he wanted to go to, the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest, and part ways with Sima Ying like Bai Ruochen had.<br>However, Sima Ying was, after all, a young lady. Chu Feng felt concerned to leave her alone.<br>Thus, he planned to bring her back to the World Spiritist Alliance before going to do what he planned to do.<br></p></div>
