        <h1>Chapter 5336</h1>
        <div>: A Trial of Certain Death<br>&ldquo;One last question. Were you the one who invited Chu Feng here?&rdquo; Yuan Jiang asked.<br>&ldquo;No, I was also planning to have Zhou Dong clear the final test. Chu Feng was an unexpected variable, though it&rsquo;s clear to me now that Zhou Dong wasn&rsquo;t qualified in the first place. My plan wouldn&rsquo;t have worked if Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;<br>Little Crescent looked at Chu Feng with expectant eyes.<br>Yuan Jiang also looked at Chu Feng as well. He noticed that the imprint on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead was slowly fusing with him.<br>&ldquo;What is that imprint? Is it really the Ancestral Idol?&rdquo; Yuan Jiang asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. It&rsquo;s just a wisp of the Ancestral Idol&rsquo;s power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why did you toy with me? What&rsquo;s your goal?&rdquo; Yuan Jiang roared angrily.<br>&ldquo;Someone who plans to betray our Ancient Realm deserves to be toyed with. As for my goal, it&rsquo;s to earn the Ancestral Idol&rsquo;s acknowledgment and leave the Ancient Realm.&rdquo;<br>Yuan Jiang stared at Little Crescent with a complicated look on his face. A few seconds later, he fell to his knees and begged for mercy, &ldquo;Lord Ancestor, I was foolish. I let my own ambitions get the better of me. Please give me a chance to redeem myself.&rdquo;<br>Ignoring Yuan Jiang, Little Crescent turned to the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief and said, &ldquo;Look closely. This is how you ought to deal with traitors.&rdquo;<br>She lifted her little hand and clenched it tight.<br>With a &lsquo;pop&rsquo;, Yuan Jiang&rsquo;s body exploded.<br>This was the man who had raised her for five years, but she didn&rsquo;t even spare him a glance before taking his life.<br>After dealing with the traitor, Little Crescent took out a golden orb. It was clearly an invaluable treasure as well. She crushed the orb and fused its crushed bits into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. Under the power of the orb, the weakened Chu Feng began to recover.<br>&ldquo;Take Bai Yunqing away and treat his injuries,&rdquo; Little Crescent ordered.<br>&ldquo;Understood!&rdquo;<br>The Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief and the others were severely injured too, but they dared not to defy her order. They dragged their injured bodies over Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s side and carried him off.<br>Little Crescent alternated her gaze between the recovering Chu Feng and Eggy&rsquo;s black gaseous flames. In the end, her eyes stopped on Eggy&rsquo;s black gaseous flames, and she murmured with a soft sigh, &ldquo;Your condition is a bit trickier, but you have to hold on. You mustn&rsquo;t die.&rdquo;<br>&hellip;<br>Chu Feng had a frightening nightmare that he thought he wouldn&rsquo;t awake from, but he jolted awake all of a sudden.<br>When he opened his eyes once more, he found himself resting inside a palace. It was the palace that those from the Ancient Realm had previously prepared for him. He had already fully recovered from his injuries. As terrifying as the backlash was, it didn&rsquo;t take his life.<br>Meanwhile, Little Crescent was sitting on a chair not too far away with crossed legs. She was munching on some tidbits. She still had the appearance of a child, but both her gaze and her demeanor betrayed a hint of age.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awake?&rdquo; Little Crescent looked over.<br>&ldquo;Little Crescent?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked. He had noticed the differences in her.<br>&ldquo;I am not the Little Crescent you know. My name is Gu Yueyue. I am one of the ancestors of the Ancient Realm. But if you wish so, you may continue calling me Little Crescent,&rdquo; Little Crescent replied.<br>Chu Feng frowned.<br>He realized that there had been huge changes in the Ancient Realm while he was unconscious. However, instead of pondering upon those changes, he hurriedly projected his consciousness into his World Spirit Space instead.<br>His body stiffened upon taking a look. He couldn&rsquo;t find Eggy inside his World Spirit Space.<br>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Milady Queen?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng shot to his feet as he asked with a hostile tone. Black gaseous flames and lightning seeped into his eyes. The first possibility that came to his mind was that Eggy had died, and just the thought of it made him feel as if he would explode from sheer rage.<br>&ldquo;Calm down!&rdquo; Little Crescent said with a frown.<br>Tzlala!<br>Lightning gushed out from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>&ldquo;Damn it.&rdquo;<br>Little Crescent flitted up to Chu Feng and pressed her hand on Chu Feng&rsquo;s head in an attempt to suppress the lightning energy he was about to release. She could tell that his bloodline power had gone berserk.<br>When Chu Feng realized that something had happened to Eggy, his rationality was swept away by a flood of anger and killing intent, causing him to lose control of himself. The only thoughts that remained in his mind were vengeance and slaughter!<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with the two of you? Why are the two of you trying your darndest to die? Are you trying to act out a melodrama before me?!&rdquo;<br>Little Crescent was rendered speechless. It was frustrating for her as she found that she was actually having difficulties trying to suppress Chu Feng&rsquo;s rampaging bloodline.<br>&ldquo;Listen well, Chu Feng! Your Milady Queen is still alive, but you&rsquo;ll have to calm down if you wish to save her!&rdquo; Little Crescent bellowed.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s lightning power began to recede upon hearing those words. His outburst had sapped his strength, causing him to collapse back onto the bed and gasp for air. He was in a delirious state earlier, but he remembered Little Crescent saying that he had to save Eggy.<br>&ldquo;Tell me where Milady Queen is. What happened while I was unconscious?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Little Crescent opened up her palm. Hundreds of millions of clothes, Cosmos Sacks, and weapons flowed out of her hand and floated in the palace. These were left behind by the massacred members of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace.<br>&ldquo;First and foremost, I have already exacted vengeance for you.&rdquo;<br>Following that, Little Crescent opened up her other palm, and a bundle of black gaseous flames blazed atop her hand.<br>&ldquo;This is your Milady Queen. She barged out from your World Spirit Space and ignited her own life force in order to save you. Had I not arrived in time, her soul would have already dissipated into thin air.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng got up and stared at the bundle of black gaseous flames. Within it, he could sense a frail life pulsating. He was not the type of person to cry, but his eyes began to redden as his emotions went haywire once more.<br>His parents had abandoned him in the Nine Provinces Continent. Eggy was the one who had accompanied him through the ups and downs of his long journey. Even though he had made many friends whom he would willingly put his life on the line for since then, the one whom he cared the most about was still none other than Eggy.<br>Seeing Eggy&rsquo;s current state made him feel like someone was hacking his heart into pieces.<br>A gleeful smile flashed across Little Crescent&rsquo;s lips when she saw how dejected he was.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I shan&rsquo;t beat around the bush. I am able to save her, but I&rsquo;ll have to pay a heavy price for it. In exchange for that, I want you to do something for me,&rdquo; Little Crescent said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll accept your offer,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied without any hesitation.<br>Little Crescent was stunned. She asked, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to ask about my request first?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Little Crescent smiled.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s surroundings suddenly warped. By the time he regained his balance, Little Crescent had already brought him to another palace.<br>This palace was humongous. Its ceiling was so high that it pierced into the sky.<br>However, Chu Feng was in no mood to appreciate the architecture. What caught his attention was a gigantic sculpture sitting in the depth of the palace. It was as tall as the palace was, but it somehow felt as if not even this palace was enough to contain it.<br>It felt like it was beneath the sculpture to be housed in this palace.<br>An aura was flowing around the sculpture, preventing others from making out its appearance. Nevertheless, Chu Feng was still able to recognize it as the figure he had met during the final test. He subconsciously touched his forehead, but he realized that the imprint had disappeared. He couldn&rsquo;t sense the boy&rsquo;s energy anymore too.<br>It was almost as if it was all a dream.<br>&ldquo;Did it get taken away?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know either,&rdquo; Little Crescent replied.<br>&ldquo;Where are Bai Yunqing and Miss Bai?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, they are safe.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief before diving into the heart of the matter. &ldquo;Speak, what do you want me to do?&rdquo;<br>Little Crescent walked up to the sculpture and paid her respect to it, saying, &ldquo;I, Ancient Realm Clansman Gu Yueyue, am grateful to milord for saving me and granting me a second chance at life. I dare not forget your grace. Today, I have found a suitable candidate, and I beseech you to open the Bloodline Gate. Should this man prove to be qualified, I humbly request milord to return freedom to our Ancient Realm Clansmen.&rdquo;<br>She kowtowed thrice to the sculpture and completed the formality.<br>A second later, the divine sculpture started to tremble.<br>Weng!<br>A ray of light shot out from the sculpture. It manifested into a towering ancient gate that pierced into the sky. The gate was opened wide, allowing Chu Feng to see what was within.<br>Inside the gate was a boundless space that was incomparably brilliant despite the absence of stars. High-pitched cries could be heard inside. Countless massive beings prowled inside the space. The smallest of them was at least the size of a small realm, whereas the biggest one was beyond human comprehension.<br>These were bloodline powers morphed into the form of primordial beasts.<br>&ldquo;Those beings are the manifestation of tens of thousands of bloodline powers. They wield their most primitive powers inside that realm. You&rsquo;ll be subjected to their trial once you enter the gate and be put through unimaginable pain. Your body and soul will instantaneously shatter under their might. Your courage and willpower will be pushed to the extreme limits.<br>&ldquo;There are two ways you can clear the test. One way is to endure their devastation and torture for fifteen minutes. As for the second way&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Little Crescent suddenly paused at this point and shook her head with a helpless smile. &ldquo;Forget it, there&rsquo;s no other way to clear the trial. I&rsquo;ll be honest with you. Many talented individuals have challenged the trial before you, but there has been not a single survivor. Honestly speaking, I don&rsquo;t think that you stand much of a chance either. I&rsquo;m aware of your protection formation, but it won&rsquo;t work there. You won&rsquo;t even get a chance to release it. You only have yourself to count on.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked at the world inside the gate once more. He could sense that even if his protection formation was invoked, it wouldn&rsquo;t faze those beings prowling that boundless space.<br>&ldquo;How long did the others survive inside this trial?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Little Crescent hesitated, but she chose to tell the truth. &ldquo;The others died the moment they stepped in.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng frowned.<br></div>
