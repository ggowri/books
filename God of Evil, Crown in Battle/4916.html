        <div>: Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s Death<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng shot a glance at Shengguang Baimei and the others.<br>The latter immediately caught Chu Feng&rsquo;s drift and quickly concealed their presence. However, they remained on their guard, ready to jump in to protect Chu Feng if the need arose.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng walked up to Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother and asked, &ldquo;Elder, where did Miaomiao go?&rdquo;<br>Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother was so out of it that she didn&rsquo;t even notice Chu Feng&rsquo;s approach. However, the moment she heard the name &lsquo;Miaomiao&rsquo;, her body shuddered and she slowly rose her head.<br>Her eyes widened the moment she saw Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?!&rdquo;<br>Even though the two of them had never met before, it was still clear from her expression that she recognized Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I am Miaomiao&rsquo;s friend, Chu Feng. I heard that a mishap has occurred to Miaomiao. Rumor has it that you were the one who killed Miaomiao. However, it appears from the circumstances that you&rsquo;re framed. Elder&hellip; what really happened here? Can you tell me where Miaomiao is right now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Miaomiao, I have let you down! I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo;<br>Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother lost control of her emotions the moment they started talking about Miaomiao.<br>Shoosh!<br>A white pearl flew toward Chu Feng. Daoist Niantian had thrown it over.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, she&rsquo;s in a poor condition physically and mentally wise. Place this pearl on her forehead,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said via voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;My apologies, elder.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng placed the white pearl on the forehead of Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother, and under Daoist Niantian&rsquo;s activation, it morphed into a wisp of white smoke that seeped into her head.<br>A moment later, the emotional state of Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother appeared to have stabilized.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I know that you&rsquo;re here for Miaomiao, but it&rsquo;s all too late. Miaomiao&hellip; is no longer around.&rdquo;<br>Despite having regained her mental stability, Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother wouldn&rsquo;t stop crying.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart turned heavy seeing her state. He was unwilling to accept Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s death, but it was hard for him to turn his eyes away from reality when even Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother was giving him such a reply.<br>However, he knew that this wasn&rsquo;t the time to be wallowing in grief. Sorrow wouldn&rsquo;t solve anything.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I&rsquo;m here for Miaomiao. Can you tell me what happened? How did Miaomiao die? Even if she&rsquo;s truly dead, I want to know who is the one who landed her in this plight,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;The culprit is my older brother, the Nine Soul Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. It&rsquo;s all my fault. It&rsquo;s my foolishness that landed Miaomiao in this plight.&rdquo;<br>Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother began telling Chu Feng about her story.<br>Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother had long wanted to bring Xian Miaomiao into the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, but she dared not to look for Xian Miaomiao without obtaining her older brother&rsquo;s approval. She was afraid that her older brother would kill Xian Miaomiao for her impure bloodline.<br>Her older brother was aware of Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s existence, but he disapproved of bringing Xian Miaomiao into the clan.<br>It was just that her older brother suddenly changed her mind one day. He promised to confer Xian Miaomiao with the title of a princess once she returned to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother was initially filled with skepticism regarding this. She sought confirmation on multiple occasions, but it would appear that her older brother was serious about this.<br>That was also when she finally made a move and brought Xian Miaomiao into the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>The Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief also fulfilled the end of his promise and conferred Xian Miaomiao as a princess. He treated Xian Miaomiao kindly, as if she was his own daughter. He even allowed his own daughter, Princess Qiu, to interact with Xian Miaomiao.<br>It was just that&hellip;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault! I was the one who landed Miaomiao in her current plight!&rdquo;<br>Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother burst into tears. Tears wouldn&rsquo;t stop trickling from her face out of utmost sorrow. Regret and guilt could be seen on her face.<br>&ldquo;Elder, what happened?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>It was already clear to him that the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had a hand in Miaomiao&rsquo;s death, but he still wanted to get to the bottom of things.<br>&ldquo;It was all a scheme. The Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had another daughter aside from Princess Qiu, which is his youngest daughter, Princess Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao is afflicted with a deadly disease that threatens to claim her life. There is only one way to treat her, and that&rsquo;s to trade another person&rsquo;s life for hers,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother said.<br>The problem was that there were four criteria that needed to be fulfilled if they wanted to use someone to trade for Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s life.<br>Firstly, that person must be a woman.<br>Secondly, that person must be a junior.<br>Thirdly, that person must be a member of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>Fourthly, that person&rsquo;s Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s bloodline must sufficiently strong.<br>Close kin fulfilled these criteria better than those from the side family.<br>&ldquo;So, Xian Miaomiao became the medicine to treat Princess Xiaoxiao?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with inconcealable rage.<br>&ldquo;Yes. I wanted to take Miaomiao away with me when I learned of that matter, but it was already all too late. I could only watch with my own eyes as Miaomiao was captured by them. Right before my eyes, they took Miaomiao&rsquo;s life away,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother sobbed.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not right, Chu Feng. Most people saw with their own eyes how Princess Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother took away her own daughter&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu told Chu Feng through voice transmission.<br>He wanted Chu Feng to continue investigating the matter to understand the full situation.<br>It was just that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t in any mood to continue pursuing this matter anymore. Instead, he asked the question that he was the most concerned about.<br>&ldquo;Elder, is Miaomiao really dead? Can you confirm that?&rdquo;<br>Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother cried even more sorrowfully upon hearing that question. Her response was the loudest answer.<br>Chu Feng closed his eyes and took in a deep breath. It took a long moment of silence before he finally calmed his feelings of anger and sorrow. He looked at Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother once more and said, &ldquo;Elder, your older brother has killed your daughter. Are you still going to side with your older brother and Princess Xiaoxiao even now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Side with them?&rdquo;<br>The face of Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother changed upon hearing those words. A vicious glint flashed across her eyes as murderous intent seeped out from her body.<br>&ldquo;As long as there&rsquo;s a single breath left in me, I swear that I&rsquo;ll take their life. I&rsquo;ll slaughter them and avenge Miaomiao!&rdquo;<br>Those words were spoken through gritted teeth. Chu Feng could sense her fury.<br>&ldquo;Elder, tell me where are the people who have caused Miaomiao&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br></p></div>
