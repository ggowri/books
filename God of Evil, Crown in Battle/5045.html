        <div>: Only Chance<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes lit up in excitement upon seeing who had appeared behind him. It was the mysterious elder who had saved his life back at the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s prison and advised him to capture Jiang Kongping.<br>Judging from the means displayed by the mysterious elder thus far, he was fairly certain that the latter was the person whom the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief believed to be able to save the Nine Souls Galaxy.<br>In fact, the reason why Chu Feng wanted to return to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan despite the risks was to gather some information about this mysterious elder, but the latter appeared right before his eyes at a timely moment.<br>This was indubitably good news.<br>&ldquo;Luckily, I left a tracking mark on you, or else I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to find you. Chu Feng, why are you so reckless? You&rsquo;ll only be leaping to your death if you were to head to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan right now,&rdquo; the mysterious elder said.<br>Those words explained why the mysterious elder was able to find Chu Feng here.<br>&ldquo;Elder, there isn&rsquo;t any need for us to head to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan anymore now that you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng chuckled softly before carrying on.<br>&ldquo;Elder, Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s ambition will cause many cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy to lose their lives. We have to stop him. Do you have any plan as to how we can do that?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng dove straight into the point.<br>&ldquo;I do know a way out, but it won&rsquo;t be easy to pull it off. In fact, whether the Nine Souls Galaxy can be saved or not depends on you now,&rdquo; the mysterious elder said.<br>&ldquo;Depends on me?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was surprised to hear that since he wasn&rsquo;t even a match for Sima Xiangtu, let alone the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a way you can deal with him, but the feasibility of it is low. You might even be put in danger. It&rsquo;s not something that anyone can do, and you&rsquo;re the only one I know who can shoulder this responsibility. That&rsquo;s why, Chu Feng, I need to ask you if you&rsquo;re willing to put your life on the line for the people of the Nine Souls Galaxy,&rdquo; the mysterious elder said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, what&rsquo;s the way you&rsquo;re speaking of?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>The Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea also stared intently at the mysterious elder, curious to know what could possibly allow them to deal with an enemy as powerful as the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.<br>The mysterious elder didn&rsquo;t answer Chu Feng&rsquo;s question directly. Instead, she took off her robe and revealed her appearance. Just as Chu Feng had suspected, she was indeed a woman, just that her appearance was more masculine than feminine.<br>Her skin was rough, her eyebrows and lips were thick, and her nose was large. She had huge eyes too, which looked oddly out of place on her despite being usually associated with good looks.<br>As for her physique, it could be easily summarized with one word: brawny.<br>Most importantly of all, she wasn&rsquo;t a human but a monstrous beast.<br>She had sharp ears and milky white skin unlike any other human. Many of her features were green in color, such as her irises, her hair, and even her fingernails. On top of that, she had a green slender tail that was reminiscent of a vine.<br>Chu Feng noticed that the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea had much stronger reactions upon seeing the true appearance of the mysterious elder. They appeared to recognize the mysterious elder, just that they were unable to believe their eyes.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; Are you from the Monstrous Spirit Clan?&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother asked with an uncertain tone.<br>The elder chuckled and replied, &ldquo;I am indeed from the Monstrous Spirit Clan. My name is Yao Cheng.&rdquo;<br>Even though the elder had a masculine appearance, her voice was incredibly soothing. From the courteous tone she took toward the Godwish Grandmother, it could be seen that she was an amicable person.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Monstrous Spirit Clan actually exists! If that&rsquo;s the case, you must be the savior whom the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was talking about?&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother asked with a hint of excitement.<br>She wasn&rsquo;t the only one who was overjoyed by the current turn of affairs. The Lady of Dao Sea also had an expectant look in her eyes. Seeing that, Yao Cheng shook her head.<br>&ldquo;I might be a member of the Monstrous Spirit Clan, but I don&rsquo;t have the ability to save the Nine Souls Galaxy. However, if Chu Feng is willing, he could become that person.&rdquo;<br>Yao Cheng turned to look at Chu Feng after saying those words.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I&rsquo;m willing to give it a try if there&rsquo;s anything I can do to save the Nine Souls Galaxy. May I know what&rsquo;s the way you&rsquo;re referring to?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get straight to the point. We might still be able to deal with Sima Xiangtu, but we wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance against the Pill Dao Immortal Sect behind him. At least on the surface, there&rsquo;s not a single power in our Nine Souls Galaxy that could oppose the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. However, our Monstrous Spirit Clan has a tool that might just be able to curb Sima Xiangtu and the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.<br>&ldquo;Our clan has been sealed off from the rest of the world all this while, allowing only clan members to enter our territory. Over the years, the seal has weakened considerably, making it possible for juniors from other clans to enter the premises too. It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s easier said than done, and there&rsquo;s a chance that you might lose your life if you fail,&rdquo; Yao Cheng said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, will I be able to obtain the tool you&rsquo;re talking about as long as I&rsquo;m able to enter the Monstrous Spirit Clan?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to say. It depends on your capability. Also, I ought to inform you that our clan members view outside cultivators with hostility, so even entering our clan will pose a problem for you. The process will be both hard and dangerous.<br>&ldquo;If you wish to give it a try, I can bring you there. Otherwise, we can simply part ways here and treat it as if this meeting has never happened before,&rdquo; Yao Cheng said.<br>A mere instant after she said those words, Chu Feng unhesitatingly gave his answer, &ldquo;Elder, I&rsquo;m willing to give it a try.&rdquo;<br>There was no way he would let this opportunity slip past his fingers.<br></p></div>
