        <div> - Golden Lightning Piercing Through The Skies<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>As if he were an inescapable net, Chu Feng began to carefully gather those astonishing organisms in the depths of the Immortal Pond.<br>He was planning to capture all of them in one go and not let a single one escape. After all, even if he were to let them remain, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves would not be able to capture them. As such, rather than wasting them, it was better for him to use them.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s actions were taking a lot of time. While Xian Yuyin had managed to trigger six Golden Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needles in merely two hours, Chu Feng had been in the waters for a total of sixteen hours now. Yet, there was still no sound of activity from him.<br>At that moment, the sky had already darkened, and it was now deep into the night. Although it was night, not only did the multi-colored brilliance of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond not decrease, it had instead increased.<br>However, when that brilliance shone on Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s face, it revealed an expression filled with worry and unease.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so long, could Chu Feng have died in there?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell him to not try to show off? Yet he refused to listen. If he is to die there, he&rsquo;ll end up dirtying the water of our Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond,&rdquo; Xian Yuyin said mockingly from the side.<br>Although Xian Miaomiao was angered by those words, she was more worried about Chu Feng. Thinking about that, her body actually began to move; she was planning to jump into the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond to search for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Miaomiao, what are you planning to do?&rdquo; However, before Xian Miaomiao could approach the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond, a figure arrived before her and stopped her. It was Xian Yuyin&rsquo;s father.<br>&ldquo;&rdquo;Let me go. I cannot let anything happen to Chu Feng,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao said coldly.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that I cannot do that. This competition is something that Chu Feng personally agreed to. Even you cannot interfere with it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, weren&rsquo;t you extremely confident in him? Why are you instead worried about him now? Rest assured, it remains that Chu Feng is someone who triggered an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle before. Nothing will happen to him,&rdquo; Xian Yuyin&rsquo;s father said with a beaming smile. His appearance was extremely vile.<br>&ldquo;Royal Father,&rdquo; At that moment, Xian Miaomiao turned her gaze to her father, the Elf King.<br>&ldquo;Miaomiao, it won&rsquo;t hurt to wait a bit longer,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; Although Xiao Miaomiao was unwilling to accept that, as her father had spoken, she ended up having no choice but to obey.<br>&ldquo;Miaomiao, what&rsquo;s wrong? Weren&rsquo;t you extremely confident in that Chu Feng? Why did you start to lose confidence now?&rdquo; Xian Yuyin arrived before Xian Miaomiao and spoke with a very mocking tone.<br>&ldquo;Xian Yuyin, you have merely triggered six Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needles. Do not act this complacently,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao said coldly.<br>&ldquo;Six Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needles is naturally very lacking when compared to you, Xian Miaomiao. However, compared to Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m afraid that it&rsquo;ll force Chu Feng to become worthless,&rdquo; Xian Yuyin said complacently.<br>&ldquo;What arrogance,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao cast a ruthless side glance at Xian Yuyin. Her gaze was filled with disgust.<br>&ldquo;Haha, whether this is arrogance or confidence, Miaomiao, you yourself know best,&rdquo; Xian Yuyin said with laughter.<br>This time around, Xian Miaomiao did not even bother to glance at him. She ignored him completely.<br>However, Xian Yuyin was not angered either. As he felt that he had grasped victory, he continued to provoke Xian Miaomiao, &ldquo;Miaomiao, didn&rsquo;t you think that Chu Feng would be able to defeat me even in triggering Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needles?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao said.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo; Xian Yuyin chuckled. Then, he said, &ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, how about we make a bet?&rdquo;<br>Xian Miaomiao did not bother to pay attention to Xian Yuyin. However, Xian Yuyin continued, &ldquo;It was Chu Feng who agreed to compete in triggering the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needles. He possessed a certain of level confidence.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I know that you dislike me. How about this? Let&rsquo;s gamble with all our bets on Chu Feng. If Chu Feng can defeat me, I will no longer bother you. From today onward, you&rsquo;ll go your way and I&rsquo;ll go mine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if Chu Feng is to be defeated by me, you will definitely have me accompany you to the Blood Devouring Killing Formation. Do you dare to gamble?&rdquo;<br>Xian Miaomiao cast a glance at Xian Yuyin. However, she merely cast him a ruthless side glance and did not answer him. At that moment, she was worried about Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety, and possessed no mood to bother with this shameless fellow.<br>&ldquo;Miaomiao, if you agree to gamble with me, we can set the limit for two hours. If Chu Feng still does not trigger an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle in two hours&rsquo; time, even if he is to be defeated, I will personally enter the Immortal Pond and bring him out to prevent him dying in there,&rdquo; Xian Yuyin seemed to know what Xian Miaomiao was thinking, and actually used Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety as the wager.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for you to go, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, it means that you&rsquo;ve accepted my gamble?&rdquo; Xian Yuyin asked.<br>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; Although she was extremely unwilling, Xian Miaomiao ended up nodding in the end.<br>She had not gambled so that Xian Yuyin could distance himself from her. She merely wanted to be able to enter the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond and save Chu Feng after two hours had passed. She did not wish for anything to happen to Chu Feng because of her.<br>Princess Lingyue had seen and heard the entire conversation between Xian Yuyin and Xian MIaomiao. However, she did not stop them, for she was also extremely worried for Chu Feng. As of now, the outcome of the competition was no longer important. All she wished for was for Chu Feng to be able to return safely.<br>After Xian Miaomiao accepted the gamble, Xian Yuyin revealed an extremely proud smile on his face. The way he saw it, Chu Feng was destined to lose, and he would be able to win the opportunity to spend time together with Xian Miaomiao by themselves.<br>As long as he had the chance to spend time together with Xian Miaomiao by themselves, he would be able to use methods to make Xian Miaomiao fall in love with him. At such a crucial moment, he would not mind using despicable methods either.<br>&ldquo;It would seem that humans are only humans after all. Even Chu Feng is unable to trigger the Golden Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needles.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Avaricious Immortal sighed and said, &ldquo;Even though I also admit that little friend Chu Feng possesses outstanding talent, he is truly somewhat conceited. That is not a good quality to have,&rdquo;  Although he appeared to be praising Chu Feng, he was actually mocking Chu Feng for being too arrogant.<br>&ldquo;It would seem that the outcome of the competition has been decided,&rdquo; At that time, the various Elf Kingdom&rsquo;s grand characters all felt that Chu Feng was unable to trigger the Golden Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needles.<br>Even though they already knew that Chu Feng would be defeated by Xian Yuyin, they all, to a greater or lesser degree, possessed some expectations of Chu Feng.<br>Thus, this conclusion had disappointed them.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle actually started to blossom with dazzling golden light.<br>&ldquo;Quickly, look! Chu Feng succeeded!&rdquo; Princess Lingyue was the first to notice this scene. She immediately cried out in alarm.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, a golden lightning bolt shot out from that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle. Like a golden dragon, it faced the world with the might of a ruler and soared into the sky.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>After it pierced through the sky, it let out a loud explosion. Then, that golden lightning bolt turned into an army of golden lightning. With an impressive display of power, it began to spread out in all directions. It was seizing control of the sky, turning the pitch black sky a dazzling golden color.<br>&ldquo;This!!!&rdquo; Seeing this scene, Xian Yuyin, his father and the Avaricious Immortal all started to frown. The scene that they did not wish to see the most had actually happened.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng actually succeeded! He succeeded! He has triggered a Golden Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle! Yay!!!&rdquo; At that moment, Xian Miaomiao started to hop around in joy, and was shouting cheers for Chu Feng unceasingly.<br>Even the Elf King, the Four Grand Elders, the Protectors and the many of the other Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; experts revealed light smiles on their faces. To them, the outcome of the competition did not matter anymore. As long as Chu Feng was able to trigger the Golden Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle, it would prove how powerful he was. After all, he was only a human.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Could it be that a human has triggered the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle?&rdquo;<br>When the golden lightning covered the night sky, all of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves in the Elf Kingdom noticed that magnificent abnormal sign.<br>All those who saw the golden lightning had an enormous change in their expressions. They were all filled with shock, for they knew that golden lightning represented humans.<br>A human had triggered the Elf Kingdom&rsquo;s Golden Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle.<br></p></div>
