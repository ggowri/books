        <div> - Fighting Against The Four Clan Chiefs Alone<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>With Zhang Ming&rsquo;s gaze sweeping toward them, those that ended up meeting his gaze all felt their bodies trembling and their hearts startled. In order to dodge his gaze, they hurriedly moved far away. In an instant, only a single person remained at the location where Zhang Ming had looked.<br>At the moment when everyone was choosing to flee, only a single person did not.<br>This man wore a conical bamboo hat. Before the attentive gazes of the crowd, he slowly removed his conical bamboo hat and revealed his true appearance. This person&hellip; was Zhang Tianyi.<br>It turned out that the person wearing the conical bamboo hat that had firmly believed that Chu Feng would come was none other than Zhang Tianyi.<br>Furthermore, Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s cultivation was a night and day difference from the time at the Gong Ba Plains. Currently&hellip; he was already a rank two Martial Emperor. Compared to back then, the speed of his cultivation&rsquo;s increase could be said to be lightning fast. His cultivation had increased much faster than Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>Of course, he was only able to attain such enormous progress all because of Emperor Gong&rsquo;s inheritance. As for that, it was also partially thanks to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor! That person is Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor, the person that obtained the title of the Strongest Younger Generation in the Strongest Younger Generation Battle Assembly held on the Gong Ba Plains, Zhang Tianyi!!!&rdquo;<br>Zhang Tianyi was currently extremely famous. Once he revealed himself, many people immediately cried out in alarm. After all, Zhang Tianyi was the person who held the title of the strongest younger generation.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Zhang Tianyi did not bother with the discussions of the surrounding crowd. Instead, he suddenly leapt into the sky and arrived beside Chu Feng and Jiang Wushang.<br>&ldquo;Yoh, little brother Wushang, you&rsquo;ve also come? Your progress is quite quick,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi said to Jiang Wushang with a smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;How could I possibly compare to you? You&rsquo;re actually already a rank two Martial Emperor,&rdquo; Jiang Wushang took a glance at Zhang Tianyi. Then, he took a glance at Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Before the two of them, I am truly so ashamed that I feel like dying.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I was only able to obtain my current cultivation because of junior brother Chu Feng,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi said as he looked to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Could it be&hellip; that you&rsquo;ve also been helped by big brother Chu Feng?&rdquo; Jiang Wushang asked in shock.<br>&ldquo;Eh? Could it be that boy, you&rsquo;ve also only managed to have your current cultivation because of junior brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s assistance?&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi was also shocked.<br>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; Jiang Wushang nodded with a smile. Then, he moved to Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s side and said in his ear with a low voice, &ldquo;Big brother Zhang, let me tell you this in secret, I am currently Lord Duan Jidao&rsquo;s disciple now. I will soon obtain Emperor Huang&rsquo;s inheritance. As for that, it&rsquo;s all thanks to big brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi was overjoyed upon hearing this. He then looked to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Junior brother Chu Feng, you are truly our great benefactor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior brother Zhang, there is no need for you to be this courteous at such a time. I never expected that you would actually manage to persuade your father,&rdquo; Chu Feng knew that Zhang Ming did not wish to provoke the Four Great Imperial Clans. Mainly, he did not wish to help Chu Feng and provoke needless troubles in the process. The reason for that was because if he were to help Chu Feng once, it would mean that he would have to help them again the next time even if he did not wish to do so. After all, even if he refused to help them again, he would not be able to escape the implication. Thus, Chu Feng knew that it was all thanks to Zhang Tianyi that Zhang Ming was willing to help them.<br>&ldquo;No, I never tried to persuade him. Merely, I ran out while he was not paying attention. I didn&rsquo;t expect that he would follow me here,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi looked to his father that was fighting fiercely against Ximen Baiyuan. Joy filled his eyes. No matter what, his father had come for his sake. Thus, he was extremely happy and proud that he possessed such a father.<br>&ldquo;No matter what, it is all thanks to you that senior Zhang Ming came to assist me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, brothers, a grand battle has begun. Let&rsquo;s chat with one another at a later time. Since we&rsquo;ve come, we cannot stand by and do nothing. Let&rsquo;s battle them,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he took out his Heavenly Immortal Sword.<br>&ldquo;Of course. Since we&rsquo;ve come here today, we must fight to our heart&rsquo;s delight!!!&rdquo; As Zhang Tianyi spoke, he suddenly leapt forth. Chu Feng followed closely behind him.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng and Zhang Tianyi had already fiercely slaughtered their way onto the battlefield, Jiang Wushang also soared into the sky and followed them onto the battlefield. Although he was only a Half Martial Emperor, his cultivation was unable to contain his determination to battle.<br>&ldquo;World spirits, listen up! Protect the three of them with your lives!&rdquo; Duan Jidao shouted.<br>After those words were said, of the thousand plus world spirits, several tens of them appeared beside Chu Feng, Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang to secretly protect them.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng was charging straight for the Four Great Imperial Clans&rsquo; Clan Chiefs. After getting close to them, he shouted to those world spirits, &ldquo;Everyone, thank you for your trouble. Please leave the four of them to me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, those world spirits all complied with his wishes and handed the Clan Chiefs of the Nangong, Beitang, Dongfang and Ximen Imperial Clans to him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what did you say? You plan to take care of the four of us alone?&rdquo; The Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief felt that Chu Feng&rsquo;s actions were extremely unfathomable. Thus, when he looked to Chu Feng, he had the appearance of looking at a fool.<br>Originally, they had had to put forth all of their effort to take care of the world spirits. This had been extremely strenuous for them. If they were to continue, they would definitely be killed. However, to their surprise, Chu Feng suddenly came at such a moment. Not only had he rescued them from the world spirits, he had even declared that he was going to fight against the four of them himself.<br>Chu Feng, a mere Half Martial Emperor, what made him think that he could contend against them? What he had done was simply provide them with a great opportunity for them to kill him. Thus, they felt that Chu Feng&rsquo;s brain had gone completely retarded.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng did not respond to the Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s mocking words. Instead, he looked to those world spirits again and said, &ldquo;You all do not have to interfere with our battle. However, everyone, I will have to trouble you all with keeping others from disturbing us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; Those world spirits clasped their fists toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>After clasping their fists at Chu Feng, those world spirits formed a defensive sphere around Chu Feng and the Four Great Imperial Clans&rsquo; Clan Chiefs, sealing them within.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The very next moment, lightning started to flicker in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes. His aura began to rapidly rise. In an instant, he went from rank nine Half Martial Emperor to rank two Martial Emperor.<br>&ldquo;How could this be? How could you directly break through from Half Martial Emperor to Martial Emperor?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is impossible! No matter how heaven-defying your methods might be, it&rsquo;s still impossible for you to accomplish this. This is simply unreasonable!&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation becoming that powerful in an instant, seeing how he had actually managed to break through from Half Martial Emperor to Martial Emperor, the expression of the Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief that was previously mocking Chu Feng instantly changed. It was not only him, the other three Clan Chiefs were also overwhelmed with shock.<br>To them, regardless of what sort of method one might have, it was impossible to directly break through from Half Martial Emperor to Martial Emperor.<br>&ldquo;Unreasonable? The common sense that you know of involves only those things within the range of your comprehension. In this world, there are a lot of things that you cannot comprehend.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re incomprehensible. Merely, you thought that just because you could not reach a certain height that others also cannot reach that height. That sort of mentality is utterly stupid and ridiculous,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head with a smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;Why bother speaking superfluous words with him? Kill him immediately! After he&rsquo;s dead, who will dare to make our Four Great Imperial Clans their enemy again?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had unleashed his attack. In terms of their hatred for Chu Feng, the one that hated Chu Feng the most among the Four Clans&rsquo; Clan Chiefs was none other than him. After all, Chu Feng had violently trampled upon his son many times. He had personally crushed the title of genius that his son had possessed.<br>Thus, not only did the Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief immediately unleash a fatal attack at Chu Feng, he also used his Incomplete Imperial Armament to directly slash at Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. He was planning to personally slice Chu Feng in two to alleviate the hatred in his heart.<br></p></div>
