        <h1>Chapter 4164</h1>
        <div> - Rather Terrible<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It would appear that you still remember me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>His smile indirectly admitted his identity.<br>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s actually you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could your progress be this fast?&rdquo; asked the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted with enormous shock.<br>He naturally remembered Asura. But, although Asura was powerful, he remembered that his world spirit techniques had been inferior to his own.<br>Yet, at that moment he had been completely surpassed.<br>&ldquo;Perhaps&hellip; this is talent,&rdquo; Chu Feng shrugged his shoulders.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that this old man will truly end up dying here today.&rdquo;<br>Upon discovering that his opponent was actually Asura, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted knew that no matter how much he begged, it would all be useless.<br>After all, he knew very well what he had done to him back then.<br>&ldquo;However, this old man would rather die by my own hands than die at your hands.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Asura, remember this! Even after his old man has become a ghost, I will not let you get away with this!&rdquo;<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted cursed furiously. Then, he opened his palm and smashed it onto his chest.<br>As the palm landed, energy ripples spread out. With a muffled sound, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was reduced to a fog of blood.<br>At the same time, his aura had completely disappeared.<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had really killed himself.<br>After seeing the Bloodmist Heavenly Exaited&rsquo;s suicide, Chu Feng smiled and shook his head.<br>Mockery and ridicule filled his smile.<br>&ldquo;Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, it&rsquo;s time for you to accept your fate. This sort of final struggle is useless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that you still didn&rsquo;t realize that my world spirit techniques have surpassed your own?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why are you bothering with such tricks?&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he waved his arm, and a dazzling golden light shot out of his sleeve and entered the bloody fog.<br>Once the golden light entered the bloody fog, the fog immediately began to transform. Soon, a figure appeared below the fog. That was the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>It turned out that the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had faked his death!<br>&ldquo;You bastard, you&rsquo;re truly not planning to let me live?!&rdquo;<br>After being discovered again, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was truly on the verge of crying.<br>The trick he had used earlier was his final life-saving trick.<br>He knew very well that since even this trick of his had been seen through, there was no way for him to escape alive anymore.<br>&ldquo;Today, I will have you suffer several times the amount of torture you gave my friends back then.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, a fierce look appeared in his eyes. Then, his golden spirit power began to transform. It turned into many sharp blades that pierced into the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s body, shuttling back and forth repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhh!&rdquo;<br>Being tortured in such a manner, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted began to scream miserably.<br>His soul was being ravaged.<br>This torture was simply death by a thousand cuts.<br>However, an ordinary execution through this method would gradually slice one&rsquo;s flesh until one&rsquo;s bones were reached. This would continue until death was attained.<br>But, Chu Feng&rsquo;s method of execution by a thousand cuts was aimed at the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s soul.<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s soul was gradually being removed.<br>It was common knowledge that once a martial cultivator reached a certain level of cultivation, they no longer needed their physical bodies, and their true foundation would lie in their souls.<br>Because of that, the torture that Chu Feng was inflicting on the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was even more unbearable than having one&rsquo;s physical body, having one&rsquo;s flesh, be gradually sliced away.<br>&ldquo;You vicious little bastard! You shall suffer a miserable death! You will die a miserable death!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if I, Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, must become an evil ghost, I will still curse your entire life!&rdquo;<br>Completely helpless, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted could only curse at Chu Feng.<br>However, Chu Feng was not at all afraid of his curses. Instead, he actually felt like laughing after hearing them.<br>Chu Feng knew that it was a powerless curse. If he had the ability to actually do anything, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted wouldn&rsquo;t be cursing like that.<br>That said, things had been nowhere as effortless when Chu Feng had confronted the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted before.<br>Was the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s current behavior not a manifestation of Chu Feng&rsquo;s growth?<br>Because of that, Chu Feng actually felt slightly pleased.<br>He had managed to surmount another mountain.<br>&ldquo;Little bastard, so it was you.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, another voice was heard.<br>Looking towards the direction of the voice, Chu Feng noticed eight figures standing in the distant sky and looking at him.<br>Those eight people must&rsquo;ve concealed their auras earlier. That was why Chu Feng had not been able to sense them at all.<br>Chu Feng recognized all eight of them.<br>They were the four leaders that had allied with Long Daozhi, and the four world spiritists they had invited.<br>They had been driven away by Long Daozhi earlier. Never would Chu Feng have expected to encounter them there.<br>Most importantly, they were looking at Chu Feng with ill-intended gazes. This made him realize one thing.<br>&ldquo;Crap!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng examined himself, and immediately felt his heart tensing up.<br>He had originally altered his appearance.<br>Even if they saw him, they shouldn&rsquo;t be able to recognize him.<br>But, when Chu Feng received the backlash from the protective formation earlier, his body had been destroyed.<br>Then, whilst treating his injuries, he had put all his focus on controlling the protective formation and restoring his body. Because of that, he had forgotten to disguise himself again.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng&rsquo;s injuries had healed, but his appearance had been revealed. That was why they had managed to recognize him.<br>&ldquo;Little bastard, you are truly vicious. You&rsquo;re actually using this cruel of a method to torture someone?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re unwilling to even give him a pleasant death?&rdquo; said the old lady amongst the four leaders.<br>As they saw Chu Feng, they&rsquo;d naturally also caught sight of the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted being tortured by Chu Feng.<br>Furthermore, they were all able to tell that Chu Feng&rsquo;s torturing method was extremely cruel.<br>Because of that, they gained a whole new opinion of Chu Feng.<br>They realized that the brat from the Ancestral Martial Starfield was also a vicious and merciless fellow.<br>&ldquo;Milords, please look carefully! That&hellip; seems to be the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted!&rdquo; Suddenly, one of the four world spiritists pointed to the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted and cried out in alarm.<br>&ldquo;Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted?&rdquo;<br>The others immediately looked to the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, upon hearing those words. They were all alarmed.<br>&ldquo;That really does seem to be him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, why would he&hellip;&rdquo;<br>They were all people that had done some transactions with the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>Thus, even though the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was currently in a soul body state, they were all able to recognize him.<br>However, upon confirming that it was the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted that was being tortured, they became even more surprised.<br>Their surprise was due to their understanding of the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s strength.<br>Especially his world spirit techniques, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was someone who had obtained their acknowledgement.<br>Even though they also knew that Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques were also very powerful, they had never imagined that his world spirit techniques would be so strong that not even the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted would be a match for him.<br>&ldquo;This little bastard is quite a talent.&rdquo;<br>When they looked at Chu Feng again, the four leaders all sighed emotionally.<br>Ignoring their different positions, ignoring their grudges, they had to recognize Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength.<br>The brat from the Ancestral Martial Starfield was truly a rare talent.<br>In fact, he could even be said to be a true demon-level genius.<br>Enduring his pain, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted shouted, &ldquo;Everyone, this brat has the Dragon Vein Source Stone on him!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All of my treasures were plundered by him too!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should you all rescue me, those treasures shall all be yours!&rdquo;<br>This was the only opportunity he had.<br>&ldquo;What? The Dragon Vein Source Stone?!&rdquo;<br>Shock filled the four leaders&rsquo; faces the moment they heard the words &lsquo;Dragon Vein Source Stone&rsquo;. At the same time, greed filled their eyes.<br></p></div>
