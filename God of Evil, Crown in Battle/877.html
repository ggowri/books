        <h1>Chapter 877</h1>
        <div> - Something Happened to Chu Feng?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Without feeling the passing of time, Chu Feng had entered the Tower of Martial Skill Cultivation for two full months already.<br>In those two full months, Chun Wu, Zi Ling, Su Rou, and Su Mei would come over and bring Chu Feng food every day.<br>Although they were never able to see him, the food they sent would usually be cleanly finished off. That also let them know that Chu Feng was doing very well. So, they didn&rsquo;t think much of it.<br>However, in the past three days, all the food they sent hadn&rsquo;t been picked up. As they looked at the food accumulated for three full days, Chun Wu, Zi Ling, Su Rou, and Su Mei all couldn&rsquo;t help but worry.<br>Putting aside the fact that the space within the Tower of Martial Skill Cultivation was very huge and there was the risk of getting lost after entering, an Earthen Taboo martial skill was very difficult to cultivate. Attempting to do so at Chu Feng&rsquo;s current realm was simply suicidal. So, after the third day, the four of them couldn&rsquo;t continue holding themselves back.<br>&ldquo;Senior Chun Wu, let&rsquo;s go together to search for Junior Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yeah! Senior Chun Wu, three whole days have passed! We are truly worried for Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, within Chun Wu&rsquo;s palace, Zi Ling, Su Rou, Su Mei, and even Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang had come. They were asking Chun Wu to let them into the Tower of Martial Skill Cultivation so they could search for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Chun Wu was in a very difficult situation as she faced their requests. She said very helplessly, &ldquo;Actually, I am very worried about him as well, but my master had said if Chu Feng wants to enter the Tower of Martial Skill Cultivation, he can, but none of you are allowed due to your cultivations.<br>&ldquo;Even though everything inside the Tower of Martial Skill Cultivation is illusory and won&rsquo;t attack us, no one can guarantee that it won&rsquo;t go astray one day. If it does, not to mention you, even with the cultivation I have, there&rsquo;s no doubt I will die inside.<br>&ldquo;Right now, Chu Feng has entered but has yet to return. It&rsquo;s quite possible something wrong happened when he was cultivating the Taboo martial skill, and it&rsquo;s also quite possible something wrong happened to the Tower of Martial Skill Cultivation. After all, regardless of its profoundness, it&rsquo;s still only a formation. No one can guarantee a formation that has existed for several tens of thousands of years will continue working safety.<br>&ldquo;Besides, there has been a few times where issues regarding the formation arose.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior Chun Wu, just let us enter! No matter life or death, it will be unrelated to you. It&rsquo;s just that I cannot leave him alone!&rdquo; Zi Ling begged with a face of sincerity. She, who was usually strong, now had sparkling tears flowing from her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Senior Chun Wu, we&rsquo;re begging you!&rdquo; Su Rou, Su Mei, Jiang Wushang, and Zhang Tianyi all begged as well.<br>&ldquo;Right now, my master is concocting in seclusion. I truly don&rsquo;t know whether something has happened within the Tower of Martial Skill Cultivation. For your safety, I cannot let you enter. However, I myself can enter and look for Junior Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chun Wu said.<br>&ldquo;Why are you all here? I could hear you talking from far away! Has something happened?&rdquo; Just at that moment, a voice suddenly rang out outside. When they looked over, they discovered it was Qiushui Fuyan. Qiushui Fuyan had returned.<br>Moreover, for some reason, there were even four beautiful people behind her&mdash;Yan Ruyu, Xia Yu, Dong Xue, and Qiu Zhu. Those four had followed Qiushui Fuyan here.<br>&ldquo;Senior Qiushui, you&rsquo;ve returned! This is really great!&rdquo; Chun Wu acted as if she saw her savior when seeing Qiushui Fuyan. She immediately rejoiced.<br>It was because Qiushui Fuyan was a Martial King! Judging by her cultivation, even if something truly happened inside the Tower of Martial Skill Cultivation, she would be able to take care of it.<br>So, Chun Wu, without hiding anything, told her everything that had happened.<br>&ldquo;This Chu Feng is too overconfident! The Earthen Taboo martial skill is a legendary martial skill! In the entire Eastern Sea Region, there has been no one who&rsquo;s cultivated it, but judging by the Mortal Taboo martial skill, one can imagine the cultivation difficulty required by the Earthen Taboo martial skill. Why does he dare to even touch it with the cultivation he possesses?&rdquo;<br>Qiushui Fuyan&rsquo;s complexion changed greatly after she heard what happened. As she felt condemning feelings, she walked straight towards the exit.<br>Chun Wu and the others quickly followed when they saw that. Originally, they even wanted to lead the way for Qiushui Fuyan, but later on, they discovered she simply didn&rsquo;t need their guide.<br>She led the way and easily walked towards the Tower of Martial Skill Cultivation with no problems. None of the people who guarded the checkpoints dared to stop her.<br>When they saw that, Chun Wu and the others felt confusion. They weren&rsquo;t confused as to why the guards didn&rsquo;t stop her. That, they could understand. After all, Qiushui Fuyan was their master&rsquo;s friend. It was something everyone in the Misty Peak knew. She had always walked where she wished, so who dared to stop her?<br>However, in Chun Wu and the others&rsquo; memories, Qiushui Fuyan never liked walking randomly in the Misty Peak. She shouldn&rsquo;t have ever come to the Tower of Martial Skill Cultivation, yet how did she know its location?<br>Even though they were confused, no one asked her because what they were more concerned about was Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety.<br>Finally, with Qiushui Fuyan leading the way, they soon arrived at the entrance to the Tower of Martial Skill Cultivation.<br>After opening the door, they saw that the food sent by Chun Wu and the others was still accumulated at the entrance&mdash;not a single bite was taken.<br>So, without saying anything more, Qiushui Fuyan strode forth and entered. But just as she entered, she returned around and yelled, &ldquo;What are you entering for? If there&rsquo;s really something wrong here, you are only looking to die by entering!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior Qiushui, we really can&rsquo;t cast our worries away! Please let us come with you!&rdquo; Zi Ling said.<br>And when Qiushui Fuyan saw their faces full of anxiousness and their moist eyes, her heart was shaken. She didn&rsquo;t say much either, and with the wave of her sleeve, a boundless Spirit Formation surged out, enveloping Zi Ling and the others. The, she leapt into the air, and brought along with her the Spirit Formation that wrapped around them.<br>Qiushui Fuyan had quite an in-depth understanding of the geography of this place. She actually knew there was a sea and many sea beasts here. Moreover, she knew they were relatively powerful and it was the best place for martial skill cultivation. As such, she flew towards that sea.<br>*boom boom boom boom boom&hellip;*<br>However, before she was even near, they were able to hear bursts of explosions endlessly erupting at the sea. At that moment, Qiushui Fuyan&rsquo;s tense heart was finally at ease. A hint of peace emerged onto her anxious face.<br>But she did not stop there, and instead, continued flying in the direction of the explosions.<br>Finally, they arrived at the origin of the noise. However, after they saw everything in the distance, almost everyone&rsquo;s expression changed greatly. Even Qiushui Fuyan herself couldn&rsquo;t help deeply inhaling. She cried out, &ldquo;This guy!&rdquo;<br></p></div>
