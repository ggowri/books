        <div> - Killing Ximen<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at the moment when the Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s attack was about to reach Chu Feng, Chu Feng lightly waved the Heavenly Immortal Sword in his hand. As a ray of light flashed past, the Heavenly Immortal Sword soared into the sky and knocked the Ximen Imperial Clan Clan Chief&rsquo;s Incomplete Imperial Armament to the side.<br>&ldquo;Heavenly Immortal Sword Technique!!!&rdquo;<br>Immediately, after that, Chu Feng unleashed the Heavenly Immortal Sword Technique. A myriad of sword rays that carried a ferocious amount of righteous aura with them began to thrust at the Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief nonstop.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>The Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief never expected that Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword technique would be this overbearing. Being caught off guard, he was unable to react in time. Even though he had already put forth all of his energy to dodge and block Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword rays, he was still grazed by the Heavenly Immortal Sword three times. At that moment, blood was flowing from three places on his body.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?&rdquo;<br>After seeing with their own eyes how Chu Feng had managed to injure the Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief in a single bout, the other three Clan Chiefs started to frown. They were extremely shocked. Although the Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s injuries were only minor cuts, it remained that he had been injured.<br>No matter what, he was a rank three Martial Emperor, whereas Chu Feng was a rank two Martial Emperor. As such, how could he have possibly been injured by Chu Feng?<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Ximen, how was it? Did you enjoy the taste of the Heavenly Immortal Sword Technique?&rdquo; Chu Feng fiddled with the Heavenly Immortal Sword in his hand while smiling at the Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. That gaze of his was filled with mockery.<br>Chu Feng had injured the Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief using their Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Heavenly Immortal Sword. To the Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, this was absolutely an enormous humiliation.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll slaughter you!&rdquo; How could the Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief possibly accept such a humiliation? He brandished his Incomplete Imperial Armament and began to slash it at Chu Feng once again. Over ten thousand crescent shaped golden slashes shot forward toward Chu Feng.<br>The golden slashes sliced through the sky and shattered the void. What the Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief used was no longer an ordinary slash. Rather, he had unleashed a Taboo Martial skill.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>At the same time, the Nangong Imperial Clan, Beitang Imperial Clan and Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chiefs also unleashed their attacks. The three of them all used their powerful Taboo Martial Skills to launch fatal attacks at Chu Feng. As it was the perfect opportunity to kill Chu Feng, the four of them would definitely not let this slip by them.<br>The Four Great Clan Chiefs all unleashed Taboo Martial Skills simultaneously to attack Chu Feng. Their combined might was so powerful that it was simply heaven-defying. All of this was aimed at a single Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Come, come, come... today, we shall settle this,&rdquo; However, even when facing the four Clan Chiefs&rsquo; combined attacks, Chu Feng was not afraid in the slightest. With the Heavenly Immortal Sword in hand, he collided with the four Clan Chiefs.<br>As their weapons intersected with one another, sparks radiated all around, and energy ripples began to wreak havoc. It looked as if their weapons contained endless power.<br>&ldquo;Quickly, look! Chu Feng is actually fighting against the Four Clan&rsquo;s four Clan Chiefs by himself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My god! It&rsquo;s actually real! How could Chu Feng be that powerful? Is he still only a Half Martial Emperor? How did he instantly become a rank two Martial Emperor?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Too frightening! He is clearly only someone from the younger generation. Yet, he is able to fight against the Four Clan&rsquo;s four Clan Chiefs. That Chu Feng is actually that powerful? He is simply even more powerful than he was rumored to be.&rdquo;<br>The chaotic warfare came as a feast to the eyes for the crowd. However, the battle between Chu Feng and the four Clan Chiefs was extremely eye-catching. In fact, there were more people watching the battle between Chu Feng and the four Clan Chiefs than there were watching the battle between Zhang Ming and Ximen Baiyuan.<br>The reason for that was because everyone knew that the main character in this battle was Chu Feng. Furthermore, Chu Feng&rsquo;s performance was truly too heaven-defying. No one had expected that Chu Feng would actually be capable of fighting against the Four Great Imperial Clan&rsquo;s four Clan Chiefs.<br>One must know that the four of them were people with extraordinary fame and grand statuses in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>Suddenly, the Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief shouted, &ldquo;Everyone, use the Golden Dragon Demon Slaying Formation!!!!&rdquo;<br>Immediately after that, he took out a golden-bright and dazzling medicinal pellet from his Cosmos Sack and swallowed it.<br>Seeing that the Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had swallowed that medicinal pellet, the other three Clan Chiefs frowned. They revealed expressions of hesitation on their faces. However, soon&hellip; traces of determination flashed through their hesitant gazes. Like the Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, they also took out the same sort of golden-bright and dazzling medicinal pellet and swallowed them.<br>&ldquo;Aoouu~~~&rdquo;<br>Not long after they swallowed the golden pellets, their bodies actually started to emit bright and dazzling golden light. At the same time, dragon roars were sounding from within their bodies nonstop. Then, the four men stood in four opposite directions and surrounded Chu Feng between them.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, several dragon roars sounded like explosions. Then, dazzling light being emitted by the four Clan Chiefs began to flicker at the same time. Upon closer inspection, several golden dragons could be seen to have actually burst forth from within them.<br>Right after the golden dragons burst out from their bodies, they began to surround Chu Feng from all directions. In this sort of situation, there was no longer anywhere for Chu Feng to escape to. [Xima: welllll, except for up and down. Martial Emperors love to fly around when they fight.]<br>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo;<br>The might of the golden dragons swept across the sky. Practically all the people present were capable of sensing their enormous power. At that moment, Zhang Ming and the others all felt the situation to be bad. Their expressions changed enormously as worry filled their eyes.<br>The Golden Dragon Demon Slaying Formation was a very powerful technique of the Four Great Imperial Clans. Although it was a formation, its power was comparable to that of a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill. Furthermore, as the formation was being used by the four Clan Chiefs, they had managed to perfectly unleash the power of the Golden Dragon Demon Slaying Formation.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>At the moment of life and death peril, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes suddenly emitted a strange red glow. Then, crimson gaseous flames began to flow out from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body like a volcanic eruption. In merely an instant, it covered the golden dragons as well as the Four Great Imperial Clans&rsquo; four Clan Chiefs.<br>&ldquo;Roaaarr~~~&rdquo;<br>After the gaseous crimson flames appeared, the speed of those incomparably mighty dragons actually decreased enormously. At that moment, their speed was less than a ten thousandth of what they had possessed before. They were truly extremely slow.<br>&ldquo;Bang, bang, bang, bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Then, muffled explosions sounded in succession. The golden dragons actually exploded into pieces and turned into golden light.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?&rdquo; Seeing this scene, the expressions of the Four Great Imperial Clans&rsquo; Clan Chiefs all changed enormously. They were deeply stunned.<br>They knew best how frightening their Golden Dragon Demon Slaying Formation was. It was a technique that they were incapable of using without taking a golden pellet. Yet, at that moment, such a powerful technique was actually broken by Chu Feng.<br>Furthermore, the crimson gaseous flames that covered them made them feel a sort of extremely fatal threat, and caused them to become extremely uneasy. It was as if they were standing before the sickle of the Grim Reaper and could be killed at any moment.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! What is that?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the bystanders were so frightened that their complexions had turned pale. The reason for that was because they, who were standing far away from the battlefield, were able to clearly see&hellip; that the crimson gaseous flames that covered Four Great Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chiefs was actually an enormous crimson head.<br>That head was extremely frightening. It did not resemble the head of a human, nor did it resemble the head of a monstrous beast. If one had to describe it, it resembled a blood-sucking devil that had a total disregard for life.<br>&ldquo;Die!!!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng pointed his Heavenly Immortal Sword at the Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; The Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was confused, and revealed a blank expression.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>The very next moment, a loud explosion sounded. The Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s body actually exploded. His body that was completely fine was actually disintegrated into pieces. He was completely dead.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, he&hellip;. Actually grasped a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill?!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, not to mention the others, even Zhang Ming was extremely shocked. He had never expected that Chu Feng, at his young age, would actually have grasped such a frightening technique. Chu Feng&rsquo;s technique most definitely had to be a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill. Furthermore, it was an extremely powerful Heaven Taboo Martial Skill.<br></p></div>
