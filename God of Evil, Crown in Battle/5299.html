        <h1>Chapter 5300</h1>
        <div>: Weird Situation<br>&ldquo;How long do you need, Milady Queen?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was excited to hear that. If Eggy was really able to achieve a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four cultivation ranks, it would mean that she could rival rank five Half-God level cultivators despite being only at rank one Half-God level herself.<br>This was such a formidable feat that even Chu Feng himself found it unthinkable.<br>This was Half-God level they were talking about, not Martial Exalted level!<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure how long I&rsquo;ll take, but I&rsquo;m confident that I&rsquo;ll eventually overcome this hurdle,&rdquo; Milady Queen replied with a sweet smile filled with confidence.<br>&ldquo;Heh. It feels good to have Eggy backing me up.&rdquo; Chu Feng chuckled.<br>Eggy had once again overtaken Chu Feng in terms of cultivation, but he wasn&rsquo;t jealous of her for that. On the contrary, he welcomed it. He celebrated Eggy&rsquo;s accomplishment as if it was his own.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother bootlicking me. Look at the enemies you&rsquo;re up against. I won&rsquo;t be able to offer much help to you. You&rsquo;ll have to count on yourself. So, what are your future plans?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>The enemies that he was up against next were much trickier than the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>&ldquo;We might have settled the Situ World Spiritist Clan, but we still don&rsquo;t have any clues on Immortal Slaughterer yet. The Pill Dao Immortal Sect is beyond our current means to deal with. I&rsquo;m thinking of visiting the Ancient Realm to take a look around first,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He retracted his consciousness back to his body and took out the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s Invitation Letter. The time was still ticking down, but to his surprise, the indicated location had changed.<br>&ldquo;Why would the location change?&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked in bewilderment.<br>&ldquo;Who cares? We just have to head to the place indicated on the invitation letter,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; Chu Feng rose to his feet and began making his way to the Ancient Realm.<br>He soon realized that he had underestimated how fast the location was changing. He was forced to travel without rest and constantly update his path. In the end, right before the timer ticked down, Chu Feng finally arrived in one of the Totem Galaxy&rsquo;s Ordinary Realms.<br>&ldquo;Will the location change again?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured worriedly.<br>He wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make it in time if the location switched to elsewhere right now.<br>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;<br>Just a brief moment after Chu Feng stepped out of the teleportation formation, another person followed out of the teleportation formation as well behind him. It was a familiar face.<br>It was Bai Yunqing, the disciple of the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s First Guest Elder.<br>&ldquo;How surprising. Did he obtain the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s Invitation Letter too?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured.<br>Bai Yunqing looked as confident as ever. The first thing he did upon walking out of the teleportation formation was to assess his surroundings.<br>Shoosh.<br>He flicked open his foldable fan with a smirk before proudly declaring aloud, &ldquo;Today, I, Bai Yunqing, shall make a name for myself!&rdquo;<br>Then, he made his way toward the southwest.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with that fellow?&rdquo; Eggy looked at Bai Yunqing as if he was an idiot.<br>In the direction where Bai Yunqing was headed in, a massive palace could be seen floating in the sky. This palace was merely a projection, but it covered the Ordinary Realm with its sheer size. Even ordinary mortals clearly could see the palace regardless of where they were.<br>In front of the floating palace was an impressively huge stone monument, which was a projection too. Despite being a far distance away, Chu Feng could still clearly see the words inscribed on it.<br>Ancient Realm!<br>&ldquo;It looks like he has an invitation letter too,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;His earlier declaration still hardly makes any sense. So what if he has an invitation letter? The Ancient Realm isn&rsquo;t like the Trial of the Strongest. I doubt that there would be any spectators given how the location of the Ancient Realm is constantly changing. Even if he does something spectacular, it&rsquo;s not as if anyone would see it,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng had turned his attention toward the teleportation formation. He saw the teleportation formation glowing brightly as groups of people stepped out from within. These groups came from different powers, and there were many formidable cultivators among them.<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that these groups had brought a few juniors together with them, and these juniors would dash toward the floating palace as soon as they saw it.<br>&ldquo;Something is wrong. Why are all of these people rushing toward the floating palace? It can&rsquo;t be that all of them have obtained the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s Invitation Letter. Did the Ancient Realm invite that many people?&rdquo; Eggy sensed that something was amiss.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure either. Forget it, let&rsquo;s head there to take a look.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng began making his way toward the floating palace too. He soon found himself standing before an ancient wooden gate that was mysteriously floating by itself in mid-air. The gate was massive, albeit rundown. It had the words &lsquo;Entrance to the Ancient Realm&rsquo; inscribed on it.<br>Beneath the wooden gate was a huge forest with trees that boasted a height of hundreds of meters, though the forest looked nothing more than a grass patch from above.<br>A huge crowd of at least several hundred thousand people was gathered around the wooden gate, and more people were approaching with each passing second. Most of them were locals of the Ordinary Realm, but there were foreigners too.<br>Bai Yunqing was amidst the crowd too.<br>Some of the groups seemed to be acquainted with one another. Some of the older cultivators gathered together and began chatting.<br>From their conversations, Chu Feng learned that the Ancient Realm had invited many people for this iteration, though they had only invited juniors this time around. This was highly unusual as the Ancient Realm rarely imposed age restrictions or did mass invitations.<br>It was so suspicious that some even wondered if the invitation was a hoax.<br>However, many of those who were invited came from distinguished powers in the Totem Galaxy. They would have been able to tell if the invitation letter was authentic or not.<br>&ldquo;Look, the Pill Dao Immortal Sect has arrived! They have obtained the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s Invitation Letter too!&rdquo;<br>Someone suddenly pointed into the distance, where a grand procession of floating warships and chariots was making its way over. The hoisted flags bear the name &lsquo;Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;.<br>&ldquo;Pill Dao Immortal Sect.&rdquo; A cold glint flashed across Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>He had previously decided to let bygones be bygones and make peace with the Pill Dao Immortal Sect over the conflict they had in the Nine Souls Galaxy, but that changed when he learned that Jia Lingyi was the mastermind behind the Golden Dragon Flame Sect&rsquo;s downfall. Once again, his impression of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect plummeted.<br>Given Jia Lingyi&rsquo;s standing, the Pill Dao Immortal Sect wouldn&rsquo;t turn a blind eye if he made a move on her. That meant that his enemy wasn&rsquo;t just Jia Lingyi but the entire Pill Dao Immortal Sect.<br>&ldquo;What a small world,&rdquo; Eggy remarked.<br>&ldquo;You can also say that lady luck is shining on me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha! I guess that isn&rsquo;t wrong either,&rdquo; Eggy replied with an excited smile.<br>She knew Chu Feng well. He would surely make the juniors of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect suffer inside the Ancient Realm.<br>The procession of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect soon arrived before the wooden gate. There were many floating warships, chariots, and mounts in the vicinity, but none of them came close to the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s scale. It was a clear display of might.<br>Even so, no one expressed their dissatisfaction toward them. On the contrary, the other powers made their way toward the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s main warship to greet them. This reflected the high standing of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect in the Totem Galaxy.<br>It was no wonder Jia Dongqi was confident that the Totem Dragon Clan wouldn&rsquo;t turn against the Pill Dao Immortal Sect for Chu Feng&rsquo;s sake.<br>Weng!<br>All of a sudden, the wooden gate tremored. A ray of light shot toward the sky before swiftly enveloping the horizon.<br>&ldquo;What a formidable formation!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could tell that it was a formidable sealing formation. Once the formation fully enveloped the Ordinary Realm, no one would be able to enter or leave anymore.<br>It might not be as powerful as the black chains used by the demon monk, but it was still a force to be reckoned with. Even an early True God level cultivator would find it hard to break this sealing formation. It would appear that the Ancient Realm was not to be trifled with.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sealing formation! It&rsquo;s said that a sealing formation would be invoked right before the Ancient Realm opens up.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The invitation letter must be real then!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it weird that there isn&rsquo;t anyone from the Totem Dragon Clan here? Were they not invited this year?&rdquo;<br>The Ancient Realm had extended its invitation to the Totem Dragon Clan in previous years, but for some reason, they weren&rsquo;t invited this year. This was abnormal.<br>Weng!<br>Golden light suddenly exploded on the distant horizon, enveloping the sky in its divine radiance. Something was swiftly heading in the crowd&rsquo;s direction.<br>The crowd, including those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, turned their sights over.<br>&ldquo;Is it the Totem Dragon Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Just as I expected, they came. I knew it. How could the Ancient Realm possibly not invite the Totem Dragon Clan? They are the overlord of our galaxy!&rdquo;<br>Many people nodded in relief. The appearance of the Totem Dragon Clan had eased their worries.<br>&ldquo;Something is wrong. That doesn&rsquo;t look like the Totem Dragon Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who else other than the Totem Dragon Clan could make such an impressive entrance?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was baffled.<br>Just then, an elderly voice echoed from one of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s carriages, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was shocked.<br>The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect was the overlord of the Heavenly Dome Galaxy. They were a power comparable to the Totem Dragon Clan. It was no wonder they could make such an impressive entrance.<br>However, this raised another doubt.<br>The Ancient Realm occasionally invited powers from the galaxies over, but such occurrences were rare. On top of that, these powers would always inform the Totem Dragon Clan about their arrival in advance as a symbol of goodwill, but it would seem like the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect had come on their own accord.<br>Something was off.<br>Grar!<br>A tinge of grayish-black aura emanating an air of malevolence suddenly appeared in the sky irradiated in golden light. It swiftly enveloped half of the sky, forming a contrasting force against the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s divine golden light.<br>It felt almost as if the end of the world had descended upon them.<br></div>
