        <h1>Chapter 1051</h1>
        <div> - The Greatest Martial Emperor<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Chu Feng opened his eyes and discovered that a woman with an extremely good figure was standing beside him.<br>This woman&rsquo;s figure was truly amazing. Long, slender and beautiful legs; robust and soft chest. Wearing a dress, her appearance caused a lot of men&rsquo;s heartbeats to accelerate and become excited.<br>Although her facial appearance couldn&rsquo;t be considered to be exquisite, the proportion of her facial features was very good. Looking at her, she gave off a very comforting sensation. Especially that soft and pink mouth, the curve of its smile was extremely enchanting.<br>This woman was the person who had spoken out for Li Lei and them during the time they were being humiliated by Zhao Genshuo. She was also the person who came to request for Chu Feng&rsquo;s help when the Cloud Thunder Pavilion was humiliating the Southern Cyanwood Forest&rsquo;s disciples.<br>After interacting with her for these past couple days, Chu Feng now knew this woman&rsquo;s name was Wang Wei. She was one of the twenty one outstanding disciples in the Southern Cyanwood Forest and also the one with the best relationship with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior sister Wang Wei, are you suggesting that this Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond have some sort of special origin? How about you tell me about it?&rdquo; Said Chu Feng with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Of course, I can do that.&rdquo; Wang Wei smiled pleasantly with her enchanting smile. She then sat down beside Chu Feng in a relaxed manner before using her sweet-sounding voice to say.<br>&ldquo;As its name implies, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond is something that has existed since the Ancient Era. It is a product of nature and also something that is deeply looked after by the Heavens. That is because, that place is truly a holy land for cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Moreover, it is not only a single pond. There are Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds located in many locations in the Holy Land of Martialism. For example, in this Cyanwood Domain controlled by the Cyanwood Mountain, there are three Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds.&rdquo; Said Wang Wei.<br>&ldquo;No wonder they said that the expert cultivators in the Holy Land of Martialism are numerous. So not only is the natural energy here better, causing one&rsquo;s bodies to be much stronger, the Heavens even bestowed Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds upon it. With such treasures, living in this sort of circumstances, it would be difficult for one to not become strong.&rdquo;<br>Upon thinking of the Eastern Sea Region and the Nine Provinces Continent, Chu Feng was unable to help himself from sighing. The Heavens was truly unfair. The Holy Land of Martialism was truly much better suited for cultivation.<br>&ldquo;Junior brother Chu Feng, that sort of saying is wrong. The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds are not things that one could casually enter as one wished. Even though the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds are open once every year, it is also the first time for me to journey to one. Do you know why that is the case?&rdquo; Asked Wang Wei.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds are not allowed to casually entered because they&rsquo;re being controlled by someone?&rdquo; Asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Clever. The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds are indeed controlled by people. Of the three Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds located in the Cyanwood Domain, other than the one that is controlled by the Cyanwood Mountain, the other two are both occupied by Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond that is controlled by the Cyanwood Mountain, they would only allow their core disciples to enter as they wished. Outsiders can forget about even dreaming to enter it. As for the two occupied by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, although they would be opened once every year, the cost of entering is not insignificant.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For Martial Lords, everyone is required to hand over a Royal Armament. Moreover, the Royal Armament must be of high quality. Neither ordinary quality ones or medium quality ones are accepted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For Martial Kings, each person is required to have over at least ten high quality Royal Armaments. As for Half Martial Emperors, even if they possess Royal Armaments, they would not be allowed to enter.&rdquo; Wang Wei said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually that expensive?&rdquo; After hearing Wang Wei&rsquo;s words, Chu Feng finally understood why even a power like the Southern Cyanwood Forest could only bring the disciples that they planned to send over to the Cyanwood Mountain every year to train in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond. So it was because the price of entering the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond to train was extravagant.<br>Royal Armaments were weapons that only Royal Cloaked World Spiritists could craft. Although for a power that had existed for a very long time like the Southern Cyanwood Forest, Royal Armaments might not be considered to be anything major. However, what the controller of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond wanted was not ordinary Royal Armaments, it was instead high quality Royal Armaments.<br>Even though they were both Royal Armaments, the slightest difference in quality caused a world of difference between them. Thus, the price that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Sprite demanded was truly not cheap.<br>To hand over several tens of high quality Royal Armaments every year was definitely an enormous price for the Southern Cyanwood Forest as even ordinary Royal Armaments were extremely limited in the Eastern Sea Region.<br>However, compared to the price that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves demanded, Chu Feng was more interested in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves themselves. Thus, he asked in a very curious manner.<br>&ldquo;Senior sister Wang Wei, isn&rsquo;t this Cyanwood Domain under the control of the Cyanwood Mountain? How come two of the three Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds are controlled by Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves? They actually occupy more Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds than the controller of this region? What exactly are these Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heh, junior brother Chu Feng, this is something that you do not know about. As one of the Nine Powers, the Cyanwood Mountain is naturally very powerful. This is something that the entire Holy Land of Martialism knew.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if one must truly compare them, then the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves are no inferior to the Cyanwood Mountain. Instead, they are much more powerful than the Cyanwood Mountain. They are a powerful race that have existed since the Ancient Era. During their golden age, it was said that even the Three Palaces and Four Clans feared them deeply. Thus, there is no need to mention about a mere Cyanwood Mountain.&rdquo; Said Wang Wei.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re actually this powerful?&rdquo; Chu Feng was a bit shocked. A race that had existed since the Ancient Era, Chu Feng was truly extremely curious about them. After all, in the Eastern Sea Region, all of the living things from the Ancient Era had ceased to exist.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s of course. The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves are truly powerful. Rumor has it that ten thousand years ago, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves controlled all of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds in the Holy Land of Martialism. Moreover, they refused to open them to any race or powers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, the Three Palaces, Four Clans and Nine Powers, these strongest human powers, all had a very strong longing for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, even though they knew that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds would be extremely impactful for their descendant's cultivation, not a single one of them dared to actually have ulterior motives for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds. The reason for that was because they feared the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, this powerful race that has existed since the time of the Ancient Era.&rdquo; Said Wang Wei.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re actually this powerful? In that case, what ended up happening? What led to the cause of the current situation?&rdquo; Asked Chu Feng.<br>Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s question, Wang Wei first took a deep breath before displaying an emotion that was hard to describe on her fair cheeks. Only then did she say, &ldquo;It was because of the only Greatest Martial Emperor that had ever appeared in the history of our Holy Land of Martialism.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Greatest Martial Emperor?&rdquo; Chu Feng immediately became interested.<br>&ldquo;Mn. He is a human. According to historical records, not only is he the most powerful human Martial Emperor, he is also a Martial Emperor so strong that surpassed all others. &rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He felt that although the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds are deeply related with the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds are, after all, things bestowed to our Holy Land of Martialism by the Heavens. He felt that all living things in the Holy Land of Martialism should be allowed to experience the benefit of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, he ended up doing the thing that everyone wanted to do but did not dare to do. By himself, he intruded the headquarters of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves and demanded for them to hand over a portion of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds to humans. Moreover, he demanded that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves to open up their Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds that they controlled to all living things once every year.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Faced with that sort of rude and disrespectful demands, the rulers of that era, those Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, would naturally not agree to it. Thus, a battle inevitably occurred.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the person that was said to be the strongest in that era, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elf King, was defeated by that great Martial Emperor. After that, that Martial Emperor became the publicly recognized strongest existence in that era.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the end, he managed to successfully have the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves renounce a portion of their Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds and hand the control of them over to the Three Palaces, Four Clans and Nine Powers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Moreover, even for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves controlled, they were required to open a portion of them up to public once every year so that all of the living things in the Holy Land of Martialism would have the opportunity to step foot and train in them.&rdquo;<br>When she spoke till this point, Wang Wei&rsquo;s tone had already reached excitement. At this moment, Chu Feng also finally understood why Wang Wei would have such a strange change in state of mind when she mentioned this &lsquo;Greatest Martial Emperor&rsquo;.<br>It turned out that sort of change in her state of mind was actually a reverence and adoration from the depths of her heart. In the bodies of females, this sort of reverence and adoration was the most distinct.<br></p></div>
