        <div> - Danger To One&rsquo;s Life<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;My, brother Chu Feng, what sort of place is that Void Sacred Tree?&rdquo; Kong Tianhui looked to Chu Feng with a curious expression.<br>Chu Feng ignored Kong Tianhui and continued to ponder.<br>He was actually focused on listening to the conversation between Chu Xuanzhengfa and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. After all, the Void Sacred Tree concerned Wang Qiang.<br>Kong Tianhui was not angered by Chu Feng ignoring him. He instead looked directly to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and asked, &ldquo;Senior Clan Chief Chu, what sort of place is this Void Sacred Tree? Why is my brother Chu Feng acting completely dazed upon hearing it being mentioned?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, young master Kong, the Void Sacred Tree is a miraculous place in our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would naturally not act rudely toward Kong Tianhui like Chu Feng did. Instead, he roughly explained to Kong Tianhui the matter of the Void Sacred Tree.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually a sacred cultivation ground. No wonder my brother Chu Feng would react like that after hearing about it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Say, Senior Clan Chief Chu, as they all say, those who have come are guests. Since the Void Sacred Tree is about to open, you might as well not hold that so-called banquet, and directly bring all of us over to check out that Void Sacred Tree. After all, we&rsquo;re all cultivators. There&rsquo;s nothing more important than an opportunity to increase our cultivation,&rdquo; said Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;What young master Kong says is quite reasonable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve long heard of the Six Great Sacred Vestiges of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for that Void Sacred Tree, it is one of the Six Great Sacred Vestiges. Never would I have imagined that we would bump into the opening of the Void Sacred Tree. We would also like to experience it for ourselves,&rdquo; At that moment, the voices of the people from the various powers that were present all began to echo in succession, expressing their desire to check out the Void Sacred Tree.<br>&ldquo;When the Void Sacred Tree opens, everyone of our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm are allowed to enter it to train. As everyone here who has come from afar are important guests of our clan, since you all wish to enter the Void Sacred Tree to train too, our clan will naturally make arrangements.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, the Void Sacred Tree opens once every hundred years. Normally, there should still be quite some days before the next opening.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In all these years, never has the Void Sacred Tree opened ahead of time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is why this old man feels that the opening of the Void Sacred Tree is quite strange. I fear that there might be dangers within,&rdquo; said the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;And here I was wondering what was so alarming about it. As the saying goes, riches and honor can only be obtained in danger. That holds true even more so for the path of martial cultivation. Senior Clan Chief Chu, as long as you are able to bring us there, it is our own responsibility to take charge of our life and death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are afraid of shouldering the responsibility, I am able to write a letter to leave behind. If an accident is to happen to me, you can hand that letter to my clansmen. I guarantee that they will not blame your Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; said Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;Young master Kong, this&hellip;&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief revealed a difficult expression.<br>He was naturally not afraid of them entering the Void Sacred Tree to train.<br>After all, he had already brought experts from other Upper Realms to their Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s Sacred Vestiges to train before. The Chu Heavenly Clan did not mind this sort of thing at all.<br>It was as Kong Tianhui had said; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was afraid of taking responsibility should something happen to them.<br>After all, there were so many people from major powers present. If they were to encounter some sort of accident in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, and the power that they belonged to decided to investigate the matter, the Chu Heavenly Clan definitely wouldn't be able to shoulder the responsibility.<br>At that time, they might even suffer a clan extermination.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Chu, I feel that what young master Kong said is very correct. We are all cultivators. We can take responsibility for our own decisions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since everyone wishes to witness that Void Sacred Tree, it is better to satisfy everyone&rsquo;s curiosity,&rdquo; said Tantai Yinjian.<br>At the same time, the experts from the other clans also began to speak in succession. They were all conveying their determination to experience the Void Sacred Tree.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, since everyone wishes to go, let us go there,&rdquo; Even Chu Feng echoed the crowd.<br>The reason why Chu Feng said that was because he wanted to immediately rush to the Void Sacred Tree to investigate things to begin with.<br>However, if they were to hold a banquet, then, for the sake of etiquette, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would definitely not allow Chu Feng to leave on his own. After all, those people were all there because of him.<br>However, if they were all to proceed for the Void Sacred Tree together, it would suit Chu Feng&rsquo;s desire.<br>With the situation being like that, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had no other option either. Thus, he said, &ldquo;Very well. Since everyone is determined, our Chu Heavenly Clan will naturally not let everyone down.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief looked to Chu Xuanzhengfa, who stood beside him. &ldquo;Zhengfa, pass down the order to open the Void Sacred Tree. All the martial cultivators of our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm are allowed to enter it to train.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, as the opening time is somewhat strange, it means that there might be some sort of change to the Void Sacred Tree. If anyone wishes to enter it to train, they are allowed to do so. Merely, as it is a matter concerning life and death, tell them to carefully consider things first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, Milord,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa accepted the order with his fist clasped.<br>Then, the group of people that came from various different powers began to majestically travel toward the Void Sacred Tree.<br>Enroute, Kong Tianhui continued to bother Chu Feng. He did not possess any of the overbearing attitude that he had displayed previously. Instead, he tried all sorts of methods to curry favor with Chu Feng, and even went as far as to present gifts to him.<br>His eagerly attentive look practically made it appear as if he was plotting something.<br>&ldquo;Kong Tianhui, go ahead and speak. Exactly what do you need my my help with? What do you want from me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, since you said it like that, I&rsquo;ll also be direct with you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, I, Kong Tianhui, am not a shameless and despicable person. I was truly forced to use the restrictive compass to challenge you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You must help me and let me win against you once. Otherwise&hellip; I fear that I, Kong Tianhui, will not be able to live,&rdquo; Kong Tianhui had a look of being forced with no alternative, and had to say such a thing. He appeared extremely pitiful.<br>Hearing what Kong Tianhui said, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze changed somewhat.<br>That Kong Tianhui was the son of the Divine Body Royal City&rsquo;s City Master. Who would dare to injure him, much less kill him?<br>Furthermore, what did Kong Tianhui&rsquo;s life being in danger have to do with him winning against him, Chu Feng?<br></p></div>
