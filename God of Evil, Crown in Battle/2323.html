        <div> - Craven And Cowardly<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Even though she was feeling scared, Xu Yiyi still gathered up her courage to ask, &ldquo;What are you all planning to do?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What are we planning to do? Your Sunset Cloud Valley and Three Stars Hall are willing to declare war against our Ying Heavenly Clan for a single Chu Feng. Right now, we are enemies. Yet, you&rsquo;re actually asking me what we plan to do?&rdquo; That Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elder sneered. His tone was filled with mockery.<br>&ldquo;You are an elder, yet you&rsquo;re planning to bully us, people of the younger generation. Do you not feel that it is beneath your status?&rdquo; Xu Yiyi asked.<br>&ldquo;Little girl, the battlefield is a merciless place. Has your master not taught you that?&rdquo; As the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elder said those words, the coldness in his eyes grew more and more intense. Killing intent actually emerged in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Senior, while the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall have declared war against your Ying Heavenly Clan, we have not,&rdquo; A disciple who had been surrounded by individuals from the Ying Heavenly Clan walked forth and bowed with his hands held in front.<br>Following that person, all of the people present that were not disciples from the Three Stars Hall and the Sunset Cloud Valley hurriedly declared, &ldquo;Senior, this matter is unrelated to us. Please release us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Indeed, it is unrelated to you all. Go ahead and leave,&rdquo; The Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elder waved his hand, and the disciples from other powers hurriedly left.<br>&ldquo;Although it is unrelated to them, it is related to you all,&rdquo; After that, that Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elder turned his gaze containing killing intent at Xu Yiyi and the others.<br>At this moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s disciples all felt a chill in their hearts. Merely from the gaze of that Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elder, they were able to tell that he truly had the intention to kill them.<br>It would appear that a great catastrophe was truly imminent for them.<br>&ldquo;Elder, you&rsquo;ve also heard it earlier. That Chu Feng and I do not get along. While it is true that our Three Stars Hall has said that we will protect Chu Feng, that is only the desire of our headmaster. I am not in favor of that decision at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, if you all are to kill me because of Chu Feng, my death&hellip; would be too wrongful,&rdquo; Suddenly, Kou Kang stood out and spoke with an innocent expression on his face.<br>&ldquo;Kou Kang, you&hellip;&rdquo; Xu Yiyi was immediately furious upon hearing what Kou Kang said. Even Song Biyu&rsquo;s expression changed. They never expected Kou Kang to be such a spineless coward and actually beg their enemy for forgiveness.<br>&ldquo;Fellow martial brothers and sisters from the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall, do you not agree with what I said?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We have no association with that Chu Feng to begin with. Why must we throw our lives away for that Chu Feng?&rdquo; Kou Kang ignored Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu&rsquo;s gazes of contempt and turned to speak to the other disciples.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. What senior brother Kou Kang said is extremely correct. We should not die for that Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, we possess no relationship with that Chu Feng. Please spare us.&rdquo;<br>Once Kou Kang said those words, regardless of whether it was the Three Stars Hall or the Sunset Cloud Valley, a portion of their disciples immediately started to declare that they had no relation with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You all&hellip; you bunch of spineless cowards&hellip;&rdquo; Faced with the begging of those disciples, Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu started to tremble with anger.<br>What those disciples were doing was not only begging for forgiveness, they were also disgracing their powers. Their actions were no different from desertion.<br>&ldquo;It is not that we are spineless. Rather, we merely do not wish to die in vain because of an unrelated individual,&rdquo; Kou Kang refuted. Then, he continued to speak to the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elder, &ldquo;Senior, please see this matter clearly, and do not kill us, the innocent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Haha. Good. Our Ying Heavenly Clan are not a bunch of unreasonable people either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you all have said it like this, I will spare you all. You all can go too,&rdquo; The Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elder waved his hand again.<br>Although Kou Kang and the others&rsquo; actions were unavoidable since they wanted to survive, they were still met with hisses of contempt from many of the bystanders.<br>After all, no matter how one looked at it, their actions were simply craven and cowardly. They possessed no moral backbone at all.<br>However, Kou Kang and the others completely ignored the way the others viewed them. They acted as if they had managed to escape from the tiger&rsquo;s den, and quickly fled that place.<br>However, Kou Kang suddenly stopped when he was about to walk out from under the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s besiegement. He turned around and sent a voice transmission to Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu, &ldquo;There is no reason for you all to throw your lives away because of Chu Feng. Come, leave with us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Scram!&rdquo; Xu Yiyi shouted coldly. Disgust filled the gaze with which she looked at Kou Kang.<br>In fact, even Kou Kang&rsquo;s fellow disciple Song Biyu looked at him with a gaze filled with contempt.<br>&ldquo;The two of you are truly pigheaded. Your deaths are well-deserved,&rdquo; Ruthlessness appeared in Kou Kang&rsquo;s gaze. Then, he waved his sleeve and swaggered off.<br>However, he did not actually leave. Instead, he entered the crowd. He was actually planning to personally see Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu getting killed.<br>&ldquo;What is this? You all are truly willing to die for that Chu Feng?&rdquo; That Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elder asked Xu Yiyi and the others.<br>After what happened earlier, he seemed to be more willing to see these disciples renouncing their relationship with Chu Feng.<br>After all, it would indirectly indicate that Chu Feng did not possess the support of the crowd.<br>&ldquo;We are willing to live and die together with our schools. If you wish to kill us, then go on and do it! Why bother with all these superfluous words!&rdquo; Xu Yiyi shouted.<br>&ldquo;We will live and die together with our schools. Go on and kill us!!!&rdquo; Following that, Song Biyu and the others disciples also shouted.<br>Their voices were like thunder and shook the heavens. They were prepared to die.<br>&ldquo;Very well, since you all have decided, I will grant you all your wish,&rdquo; That Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elder once again revealed killing intent in his eyes. As he spoke, he raised his hand.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>In an instant, surging winds covered the region as the sky darkened. His rank three Martial Ancestor-level oppressive might swept forth. It was as if doomsday were descending.<br>At that moment, Xu Yiyi and the others closed their eyes. They were prepared to accept death.<br>The reason for that was because it was simply impossible for them to survive before that oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that you will not be able to kill them today.&rdquo;<br>Right at the moment when everyone felt that Xu Yiyi and the others would undoubtedly be killed, a voice sounded.<br>That voice came explosively like a thunderstrike, shocking the hearts of everyone.<br>Most shockingly, after that voice was heard, the crowd was surprised to discover the raised arm of that Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elder had actually frozen in midair. At the same time, his boundless oppressive might vanished completely.<br>To be exact, his oppressive might was forced back by an oppressive might even more powerful than his own.<br>Rank four Martial Ancestor. It was a rank four Martial Ancestor&rsquo;s oppressive might that saved Xu Yiyi and the others.<br>&lsquo;Could it be that reinforcements from the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall have arrived?&rsquo;<br>That was what the crowd thought at this instant.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him?&rdquo;<br>However, upon looking toward the direction of the voice, the crowd were tongue-tied and stunned. Disbelief filled their eyes.<br>A figure was slowly walking toward them from not far away. However, that person was not an elder or senior from the Sunset Cloud Valley or the Three Stars Hall.<br>Instead, he was a young man, someone much younger than majority of the younger generation present.<br>As for this man, he was none other than Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng? Isn&rsquo;t that Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens! How did he become this powerful? He&rsquo;s actually a rank four Martial Ancestor!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No wonder, no wonder he was able to kill Ying Liangchen and Di Jiuzhou; Chu Feng was actually as powerful as he was rumored to be!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To possess a cultivation of rank four Martial Ancestor at such a young age, he is definitely an exceptional genius, most definitely! An exceptional genius has really appeared in our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the surrounding crowd burst into an uproar. All they were saying were praises for Chu Feng.<br>It was not that they were trying to flatter him. Rather, at that moment, they were truly stunned by how powerful Chu Feng was.<br><br></p></div>
