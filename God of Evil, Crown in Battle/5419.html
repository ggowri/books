        <div><span>: Dao of Absolute Darkness</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>By the time Chu Feng noticed her, the remnant&rsquo;s master had already turned her gaze toward the black crystal.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an item from the Immemorial Era. Contained within it are three Daos of Absolute Darkness. I grasped one of the daos and developed my own secret art. Another person grasped another one and developed a fairly powerful secret art too. Only one Dao of Absolute Darkness remains inside the crystal, but it is also the hardest one to grasp.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Upon hearing those words, Chu Feng turned his attention toward the black crystal.</span><br><span>The remnant&rsquo;s master was an unbelievably powerful cultivator; her words showed just how powerful the Dao of Absolute Darkness contained within the black crystal was.</span><br><span>As scary as the black crystal was, he started to bear expectations about it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Would you like to give it a try?&rdquo; the remnant&rsquo;s master asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>With a swivel of the red aura, a snowy-white hand shot out from within. The hand opened up to reveal another bundle of red aura. This bundle was only the size of an apple, but the realm trembled at its appearance.</span><br><span>&ldquo;A secret art?&rdquo; Chu Feng could tell that this bundle of red aura was a secret art, one far greater than anything else he had seen.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You have cleared my test, and this is the reward you are entitled to. It isn&rsquo;t my strongest secret art, but it&rsquo;s stronger than anything else you have,&rdquo; the woman said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, you&rsquo;re able to see the secret arts within me?&rdquo; Chu Feng was surprised.</span><br><span>The remnant&rsquo;s master didn&rsquo;t answer that question. Instead, she turned her gaze toward the sealed black crystal and said, &ldquo;That being said, the true treasure in my imperial palace is </span><span>that black crystal. I could give you the chance to grasp the Dao of Absolute Darkness, but you&rsquo;ll only get one try. Once you choose to take up that opportunity, I&rsquo;ll take back my secret art regardless of whether you succeed or not.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng understood that the woman was offering him a choice. Eggy was aware of what was going on too, but she chose to remain silent so that he could make his own choice.</span><br><span>There was no doubt that the secret art offered by the remnant&rsquo;s master was formidable, but the black crystal was clearly even greater than that, just that grasping it would be no easy feat.</span><br><span>After all, the remnant&rsquo;s master wouldn&rsquo;t have left the final Dao of Absolute Darkness lying around if either she or her subordinates had the means to grasp it. The fact that she was unable to do so showed just how difficult the undertaking was.</span><br><span>Rationally speaking, it was wiser for Chu Feng to choose the secret art.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try grasping the final Dao of Absolute Darkness,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You should know what you have to do. If you can&rsquo;t even figure that out, you aren&rsquo;t even qualified to try,&rdquo; the remnant&rsquo;s master said.</span><br><span>With a confident smile, Chu Feng flitted over to the sealed black crystal. He had taken a close look at the black crystal, and thanks to the tip from the remnant&rsquo;s master, he had a good idea as to how he could grasp the secrets lying within it.</span><br><span>The black crystal was actually extremely far away even though it was in Chu Feng&rsquo;s sight; it was only visible due to its sheer size. Even with Chu Feng&rsquo;s speed, it would take a very long time for him to reach it.</span><br><span>However, Chu Feng patiently made his way toward the black crystal, not bothering to raise his cultivation even.</span><br><span>All of a sudden, a whiff of black aura appeared ahead and charged at him.</span><br><span>Instead of dodging the black aura, Chu Feng allowed it to strike him and seep into his body. Excruciating pain ensued, causing him to clench his fists and grit his teeth. Even his veins popped out from the sheer pain. Yet, instead of falling into anxiety, he felt excited.</span><br><span>This pain signaled a step closer to success. He had to overcome it to prove his qualification to grasp the Dao of Absolute Darkness.</span><br><span>It didn&rsquo;t take him long to absorb the black aura.</span><br><span>Along with his first success, the moving strings of blue light suddenly stopped their movements and froze in place.</span><br><span>Chu Feng opened his arms wide and commanded those strings of blue light to flow toward the black crystal to unravel the seals on it. It was worth noting that those strings of blue light weren&rsquo;t moving around haphazardly; in truth, they were breaching the formations.</span><br><span>Soon, the talismans on the chains started to dissipate one after another. With a loud bam, the chains scattered in all directions.</span><br><span>The freed black crystal finally released a powerful suction force that instantaneously </span><span>dragged Chu Feng into it. Time quickly ticked by, and two hours passed in an instant.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He still isn&rsquo;t out yet even though two hours have passed. It looks like he has failed,&rdquo; the remnant&rsquo;s master said with a sigh.</span><br><span>She was just about to leave when she suddenly turned her gaze toward the black crystal. &ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</span><br><span>A deafening shatter reverberated throughout this boundless realm. It had come from none other than the black crystal. Cracks had appeared all over the black crystal, and lightning bolts spilled out from those cracks.</span><br><span>The surroundings only grew brighter as the lightning bolts further intensified.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>With a deafening explosion, a terrifying flood of power devoured the boundless realm.</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>While there were many forbidden lands in the Immemorial Domain of Gods, the Death Starfield was indubitably one of the most feared ones. Its land was filled with many ferocious beasts that had survived the Ancient Era, but what terrified others were the black flame dragons covered in black armor.</span><br><span>These black flame dragons could grow up to hundreds of thousands of meters long. A flick of their tail could easily whip up a storm. Their breaths could eradicate entire realms.</span><br><span>And there were thousands of them in the Death Starfield, every single one of them an adult.</span><br><span>Yet, all of these black flame dragons were dead. They had been reduced to heaps of black flesh, with their scales scattered everywhere.</span><br><span>The carcasses weren&rsquo;t just limited to the black flame dragons. There were hundreds of thousands of other deceased ferocious beasts too. Their tattered bodies were left drifting in boundless space.</span><br><span>However, what was most terrifying of all was the red aura shrouding the surroundings. Standing at the heart of the red aura was a red-haired woman.</span><br><span>The red-haired woman had a domineering disposition that felt almost as if the world belonged under her foot. Her eyes were closed, looking like she had fallen into a peculiar state.</span><br><span>All of a sudden, she opened her eyes. There was a contemplative gleam in her gaze. Moments later, a smile formed on her lips.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng? Interesting.&rdquo;</span><br></p></div>
