        <h1>Chapter 4236</h1>
        <div> - Yu Sha Appearing On Stage<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Is there anyone else that&rsquo;s still unconvinced?&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng raised that question, the crowd immediately turned absolutely quiet.<br>Even though this was the first time that the majority of them had met Chu Feng, he had been able to easily defeat Chen Guang.<br>Because of that, they knew that he possessed true strength.<br>An existence as powerful as him had most definitely grasped rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>Chen Guang was also someone that had grasped rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>Yet, he was still easily defeated.<br>This meant that Chu Feng possessed an extraordinarily strong battle power that far surpassed that of ordinary world spiritists.<br>Unless it was someone that had grasped rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation, who would possibly dare to challenge him?<br>&ldquo;If no one is unconvinced, this reward will go to Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Old Man Compliance spoke.<br>He noticed that after Chen Guang had been miserably defeated by Chu Feng, the others present did not dare to issue another challenge.<br>They were afraid of failure. After all, the price of being defeated by Chu Feng was enormous.<br>&ldquo;I am unconvinced.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice was heard.<br>It was the dark-skinned fatty, Yue Yang.<br>&ldquo;Yue Yang? He&rsquo;s planning to issue a challenge?!&rdquo;<br>Whilst Yue Yang&rsquo;s reputation was not at all inferior to Chen Guang&rsquo;s, the crowd all felt that since Chen Guang had been defeated, Yue Yang would only be asking for trouble by challenging Chu Feng.<br>Even though the crowd knew Yue Yang much better than Chu Feng, no one thought that he could win against Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Introduce yourself,&rdquo; said Old Man Compliance.<br>&ldquo;I am the Heaven-plundering Grandmaster&rsquo;s disciple, Yue Yang.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I am unconvinced with you. But&hellip;if I am to challenge you, I demand to set the rules,&rdquo; Yue Yang said to Chu Feng.<br>Even the bystanders were surprised by Yue Yang&rsquo;s words.<br>He was clearly the challenger. How was he qualified to set the rules?<br>He was acting as if Chu Feng was the one challenging him.<br>This was completely unconventional.<br>Thus, after hearing those words, even Old Man Compliance narrowed his brows. He showed his displeasure, and was about to lash out at Yue Yang.<br>But, before Old Man Compliance could reprimand Yue Yang, Chu Feng spoke, &ldquo;Very well. You decide the rules. As long as it&rsquo;s not too excessive, I can accept anything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He actually agreed to it?!&rdquo;<br>The crowd felt a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng after hearing those words.<br>Especially after they saw how calm, composed and confident he looked.<br>They suddenly felt that Chu Feng was unfathomable.<br>His didn't appear to be a pretense at all.<br>Compared to the surprise of the bystanders, Yue Yang was overjoyed.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, then I, Yue Yang, will be blunt.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, please let me in.&rdquo;<br>Yue Yang clasped his fist toward Old Man Compliance.<br>Whilst Old Man Compliance was not fond of the manner in which Yue Yang had challenged Chu Feng, he did not say anything since Chu Feng had agreed to it.<br>After all, he had mentioned earlier that the challenger and Chu Feng would be the ones to determine the rules.<br>Because of that, he waved his sleeve and opened another spirit formation gate.<br>Yue Yang immediately entered the spirit formation gate. He was very eager. It was as if he was afraid that Chu Feng would back out.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, my condition is very simple.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We shall not fight. Instead, we will have our world spirits compete.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our world spirits shall determine the outcome of the match,&rdquo; Yue Yang said to Chu Feng with a beaming smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;Compete with world spirits?&rdquo;<br>The crowd immediately came to realize what Yue Yang had in mind upon hearing those words.<br>After all, it was common knowledge that Yue Yang&rsquo;s world spirits were very powerful. After all, he was an Asura World Spiritist.<br>What the crowd didn&rsquo;t know was that Yue Yang had challenged Chu Feng to a match with their world spirits before. At that time, Chu Feng had conceded.<br>That was also the reason why Yue Yang dared to challenge Chu Feng even after Chen Guang was defeated.<br>Yue Yang felt that it was likely true that Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques had been sealed away because of a treasure.<br>After all, the battle power of the world spirit technique that Chu Feng had displayed earlier had been truly astonishing.<br>But, world spirits were something that a world spiritist should possess a great amount of.<br>Yet, Chu Feng had told him that his world spirits were in closed-door training.<br>No one would acknowledge such a thing.<br>Yue Yang naturally didn&rsquo;t believe it either.<br>As such, the only possible explanation would be that Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirits were not strong at all. That was why he was afraid and cowered before his previous challenge.<br>His world spirits being in closed-door training was merely an excuse.<br>Afraid that Chu Feng would not accept his challenge, Yue Yang asked provocatively, &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly be afraid to accept my challenge, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Or could it be that you&rsquo;re planning to tell me that your world spirits are still in closed-door training?&rdquo;<br>After all, Chu Feng had refused and conceded in a match with world spirits back then.<br>&ldquo;Speaking of it, it is truly a coincidence. My world spirit just so happened to have exited her closed-door training today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This serves as the best opportunity to make up for the regret back then,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>He had anticipated that Yue Yang would challenge him to a match with world spirits.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s agreement to his challenge had actually caused Yue Yang some slight discomfort.<br>But, as he had already shot the arrow, there was no way to retrieve it mid-flight. Besides, he was very confident in his world spirits. As such, Yue Yang did not cower, and instead opened his world spirit gate.<br>Three world spirits then walked out of his world spirit gate.<br>Seeing the three world spirits, the expressions of the crowd all changed.<br>Those three world spirits were not hiding their cultivations. As such, the crowd were all able to tell that they were all rank one Utmost Exalteds.<br>The three of them were all world spirits from the Asura Spirit World. Chu Feng had met one of them back then.<br>Back then, Yue Yang had only released a single world spirit. Yet at that moment, he had sent out three at once.<br>From this, it could be seen that Yue Yang was extremely serious.<br>&ldquo;Amazing. He&rsquo;s actually able to summon Utmost Exalted-level world spirits?&rdquo;<br>Some among the crowd were astonished by Yue Yang&rsquo;s ability to summon three rank one Utmost Exalted-level world spirits.<br>Even though they&rsquo;d already heard of the might of Yue Yang&rsquo;s world spirits, the world spirits they&rsquo;d heard of were nowhere as powerful as the ones he had summoned. Yue Yang&rsquo;s world spirits had grown stronger again.<br>Chu Feng did not rush to open his world spirit gate. Instead, he asked Yu Sha, &ldquo;Yu Sha, how is it? This shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Open the gate,&rdquo; Yu Sha replied with three words.<br>Once Chu Feng heard those words, a smile appeared on his face.<br>That was the personality that Yu Sha had. She spoke very little, but was most definitely not a pushover.<br>Back then, it was Yu Sha who had fought against Linghu Hongfei and had won Chu Feng the title of first place amongst the Ancestral Martial Decastars.<br>Her battle power was extremely astonishing.<br>Chu Feng opened his world spirit gate, and Yu Sha&rsquo;s wonderful figure appeared before the crowd.<br>&ldquo;That world spirit is so beautiful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A world spirit giving off such an air is truly rare.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That must also be a world spirit from the Asura Spirit World, no? This Chu Feng is also an Asura World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>The eyes of many people changed upon seeing Yu Sha. Especially the men, their eyes were completely fixed onto her.<br>The people that were present were all prestigious people. All of them had seen countless beauties.<br>But, when they saw Yu Sha, they were still enchanted by her beauty.<br>The truth was that Yu Sha&rsquo;s beauty was actually slightly inferior when compared to Eggy.<br>But, the airs that Yu Sha emitted was something very few people could compare to.<br>That alone was enough to intoxicate the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Quite decent-looking. But I wonder, how are her skills?&rdquo;<br>There was a bit of jealousy in Yue Yang&rsquo;s tone.<br>Whilst they were both Asura World Spiritists, the appearance of his world spirits were unable to compare to Yu Sha.<br>But, he was not afraid. After all, what world spirits competed in was their strength.<br>But soon, Yue Yang&rsquo;s expression changed. He turned to Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly be planning to take on my three world spirits with a single world spirit, right?&rdquo;<br>Yue Yang had discovered that other world spirits had come out of Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit gate.<br>Even though he was very surprised, he thought that Chu Feng might be planning to fight his three world spirits with a single world spirit.<br>&ldquo;Is something wrong with that?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words, Yue Yang was overjoyed. With a beaming smile, he said, &ldquo;No, of course not. That&rsquo;s your choice. If you lose, just don&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m bullying you with numbers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I will not blame you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>His words had confirmed Yue Yang&rsquo;s guess.<br>At that moment, the others present were also unable to understand Chu Feng&rsquo;s decision.<br>Yu Sha had not hidden her cultivation when she appeared. Thus, the crowd were able to sense that she was emitting the aura of a rank one Utmost Exalted.<br>There was naturally no issue with her cultivation. But, to take on three opponents was clearly unfair.<br>Was Chu Feng being excessively confident by doing this?<br>Or could it be that he did not have another rank one Utmost Exalted-level world spirit to fight in the confrontation?<br>Right when the crowd were making guesses, another voice sounded. When that voice was heard, the shock on the crowd&rsquo;s faces grew even stronger.<br>&ldquo;Go ahead and let out all your world spirits. I&rsquo;ll handle all of them so that we won&rsquo;t waste time here.&rdquo;<br>It was Yu Sha that had spoken.<br>Her voice was very pleasant to hear, but her beautiful eyes were filled with contempt.<br></p></div>
