        <h1>Chapter 4088</h1>
        <div> - Must Die?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that Li Mengyue was losing, Chu Feng intended to act.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>But before that, Li Mengyue raised her arm, and a golden ring of light flew towards Chu Feng.<br>That golden ring of light actually locked him in place.<br>&ldquo;This matter has nothing to do with you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is now something between this young miss and him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You behave yourself and stay there. Watch how this young miss will take care of this old fool.&rdquo;<br>After Li Mengyue said those words, white gaseous flames began to pour from her body.<br>The white gaseous flames were like steam.<br>They did not appear sacred or special at all.<br>Yet, when the white gaseous flames appeared, Li Mengyue grew fiercer the more she fought.<br>She who was at a disadvantage in the battle was actually beginning to match the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s here. That&rsquo;s the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Third Young Miss&rsquo;s power, the Soul-burning Divine Body!&rdquo;<br>Cries sounded from the people outside.<br>The Soul-burning Divine Body was different from ordinary Divine Bodies.<br>Like ordinary Divine Bodies, Soul-burning Divine Bodies possessed special power capable of strengthening a cultivator&rsquo;s battle power.<br>However, Soul-burning Divine Bodies possessed power that ordinary Divine Bodies did not.<br>With it, one could burn one&rsquo;s soul to obtain even greater battle power.<br>The appearance of the white gaseous flames meant that Li Mengyue had begun using her Soul-burning Divine Body to burn her soul.<br>That was also the reason why she was able to contend against the Demonized Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>&ldquo;This girl, has she gone mad?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s actually using the power of her Soul-burning Divine Body&rsquo;s power for the sake of an irrelevant outsider?&rdquo;<br>The Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had a look of anger on his face as he saw this scene.<br>Even though the Soul-burning Divine Body would not really burn Li Mengyue&rsquo;s soul, using it would still burden her. Furthermore, this burden was not small at all.<br>As such, unless absolutely necessary, not even Li Mengyue would use her Soul-burning Divine Body to burn her own soul.<br>Yet at that moment, Li Mengyue was actually using her Soul-burning Divine Body&rsquo;s power to protect Chu Feng.<br>This greatly confused the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>That was his daughter. He knew his daughter best.<br>Even though Li Mengyue was a weird individual and acted like a little girl, she was actually very cold-hearted, and not a woman that took pleasure in helping others.<br>How cold-hearted was Li Mengyue?<br>She had once disregarded her dying biological younger sister.<br>That was why the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was so confused.<br>He truly couldn&rsquo;t understand why the cold and unfeeling Li Mengyue would go to Chu Feng&rsquo;s aid.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>In the sky, explosions sounded all over, and energy ripples surged violently.<br>The battle between Li Mengyue and the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master had destroyed everything in that region.<br>At the same time as the crowd were shocked, they were also exclaming in admiration repeatedly.<br>While they had heard of Li Mengyue&rsquo;s strength, very few people had actually witnessed it.<br>Seeing it for themselves today, they realized that her battle power was truly exceptional.<br>That could be seen from how she was able to fight the Demonized Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master to a stalemate.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a slash swept across the sky.<br>Following that, a figure was sent flying.<br>At that moment, the crowd noticed that the person that flew out from the battlefield was Li Mengyue.<br>Li Mengyue no longer had her previous calm expression.<br>Her body was still emitting a white gaseous flame, but she was panting and gasping. Her tense and ugly expression allowed the crowd to realize that her condition seemed to be rather bad.<br>Then, something that surprised everyone occurred.<br>A sweet smile blossomed on Li Mengyue&rsquo;s face.<br>With a beaming smile, Li Mengyue said in the direction of the battlefield, which still surged with energy ripples that were wreaking havoc everywhere, &ldquo;Senior Isle Master, I was merely joking with you earlier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I merely wanted to test out the strength of your Constellation Immortal Technique&rsquo;s Demonization.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Experiencing it today, it is truly exceptional. This junior finds herself to be beneath senior.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Once her words were said, a cold laughter sounded from within the battlefield.<br>Following that cold laughter, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master walked out from the battlefield.<br>His body was still enveloped by black flames. He still resembled a terrifying demon.<br>At that moment, there was an additional item in his hand.<br>It was his Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>Seeing that, the crowd realized why Li Mengyue was suddenly no match for him.<br>When the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master had first fought Li Mengyue, he'd been empty-handed, whereas Li Mengyue was using her Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>Now that the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master had also revealed his Incomplete Exalted Armament, his battle power had increased. With that, Li Mengyue was no longer a match for him.<br>&ldquo;I originally didn&rsquo;t intend to kill you. You were the one courting death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to regret it now.&rdquo;<br>After the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master said those words, his body shifted, and he rushed to attack Li Mengyue again.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ll have to seek lady luck&rsquo;s help yourself.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Li Mengyue turned around and flew off into the distance.<br>She was actually attempting to flee.<br>However, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master&rsquo;s speed was evidently faster than hers.<br>Soon, the black flames had caught up to the white flames.<br>The black flames blocked Li Mengyue&rsquo;s path of escape.<br>&ldquo;You were originally able to live. Yet, you insisted on dying.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, this old man will help you achieve your goal.&rdquo;<br>After catching up to Li Mengyue, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master&rsquo;s attacks grew fiercer. Every single attack he made with his weapon was aimed at Li Mengyue&rsquo;s life.<br>Seeing that she could not escape, Li Mengyue had no choice but to face him. She was putting forth her all to block his attacks.<br>But, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master was simply too powerful. Li Mengyue was forced to retreat repeatedly. She was already on the verge of collapse.<br>Seeing this scene, the crowd were all very anxious.<br>As for the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, he was simply worried beyond belief.<br>After all, that was his most beloved daughter, his most valued daughter.<br>In fact, if he were to consider things from the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s standpoint, Li Mengyue was their future.<br>Absolutely nothing could be allowed to happen to her.<br>&ldquo;Pang Youyang, get there faster!&rdquo;<br>Overwhelmed with nervousness, the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master shouted furiously in the palace hall.<br>He knew that it would be too late for him to act personally.<br>By the time he arrived at the Purple Star Variance Realm and found his daughter and the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master, Li Mengyue would most likely already be dead.<br>He could only entrust the fate of his daughter to Pang Youyang.<br>But, at the moment when the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master attacked again, the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was struck dumb.<br>With that strike, the Incomplete Exalted Armament Li Mengyue held in her hand was sent flying.<br>Having lost her Incomplete Exalted Armament, her battle power decreased.<br>Faced with the Demonized Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master, she simply had no way to fight back anymore.<br>&ldquo;Prepare to die!&rdquo;<br>Following a furious shout, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master hacked downwards at Li Mengyue.<br>If that strike were to land, Li Mengyue&rsquo;s body would be chopped in two.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>At the moment when everyone felt that Li Mengyue would die, sparks suddenly lit up the sky.<br>The Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master&rsquo;s Incomplete Exalted Armament had actually been blocked by someone.<br></p></div>
