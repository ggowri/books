        <div>: Hidden Dragon Life Tower<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng felt his heart clenching tightly.<br>&ldquo;Do I know you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked via voice transmission.<br>The other party&rsquo;s voice sounded light-hearted, but it seemed to carry animosity as well. His enigmatic tone made it hard for Chu Feng to discern his intention.<br>Chu Feng thought about the enemies he made, but there didn&rsquo;t seem to be anyone who could possibly be the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know who I am soon enough,&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple said via voice transmission with a chuckle.<br>After saying those words, he turned to the sectmaster and said, &ldquo;Master, if there&rsquo;s nothing else, I&rsquo;ll be taking my leave.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master?! This means that the sectmaster has taken the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple as her closed-door disciple!&rdquo;<br>The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple&rsquo;s words immediately stirred a huge commotion. Being the sectmaster&rsquo;s closed-door disciple was a huge matter.<br>They had long heard that the sectmaster was intending to raise him as the future sectmaster, and this pretty much verified the rumors.<br>&ldquo;You may leave,&rdquo; the sectmaster said with a wave of her hand..<br>The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple quickly left the area. He seemed to be someone who had no respect for anyone other than the sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, what should we do about this?&rdquo; the vice sectmaster asked.<br>He was asking if it was really alright to hand the position of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple to Chu Feng just like this, and whether Zi Ling was really going to be betrothed to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng isn&rsquo;t qualified to marry Zi Ling,&rdquo; the sectmaster said.<br>Zuoqiu Youyu broke out into a smile upon hearing those words whereas Chu Feng&rsquo;s face turned livid.<br>He thought that he would be able to marry Zi Ling after the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple handed his seat to him, but who could have thought that the sectmaster would oppose it.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, I think what your closed-door disciple said makes sense. The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple is a position given to him, He has the right to pass it down to anyone he wants to,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said.<br>He felt obliged to speak up for Chu Feng as his older brother.<br>&ldquo;Is the position of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple something that could be given away so easily? Are you suggesting that your position as a Hidden Dragon Elder can be passed down to anyone you want to? What becomes of the rules of our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect then?<br>&ldquo;To think that you would say such words despite being the Hidden Dragon Chief Elder!&rdquo; the sectmaster bellowed in displeasure.<br>No one thought that there was anything wrong with what the sectmaster said. There were simply some positions where one had to prove themselves worthy to obtain.<br>Take the sectmaster position for example. The sectmaster could indeed bestow her position upon anyone and force everyone to accept, but if her successor was unqualified, how many people would recognize it?<br>It would only undermine the significance of the position and cause great complications in the future.<br>However, Duan Liufeng knew just how important this matter was to Chu Feng, so he didn&rsquo;t back down despite being criticized by the sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, I agree with your words. However, I believe that your disciple has his own reasons for wanting to pass his position down to Chu Feng, and this likely has something to do with Zi Ling. Perhaps, he might have thought that Chu Feng is a more suitable spouse for Zi Ling? Since he wishes to bring the two of them together, I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s any reason why we have to forcefully separate them,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said.<br>&ldquo;Duan Liufeng, you seem to have a lot to say today.&rdquo;<br>The sectmaster shot a deathly cold glare at Duan Liufeng. Everyone could sense her displeasure clearly. It was so terrifying that everyone immediately shut their mouths, including Duan Liufeng.<br>Chu Feng clenched his fists tightly, but he didn&rsquo;t say a word.<br>There was no choice. He could only accept the sectmaster&rsquo;s verdict even if he disagreed with it. He was currently in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, a place where the sectmaster&rsquo;s words were law.<br>While Chu Feng was feeling deeply aggrieved, there were people celebrating his tragedy, such as Zuoqiu Youyu. Despite his severe injuries, he still looked at Chu Feng gleefully. He wasn&rsquo;t the only one feeling that way.<br>Chu Feng had been hogging the spotlight too often in recent days that many people weren&rsquo;t too fond of him. They were waiting for the day where he would finally be dragged down from his grace.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is indeed unqualified to become the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple, but he has made an announcement yesterday that he would enter the Hidden Dragon Life Tower within three days and break Dugu Lingtian&rsquo;s record.<br>&ldquo;If he fails, he would leave the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect on his own accord. If he succeeds, even if he isn&rsquo;t the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple, he would still be qualified to marry Zi Ling. Of course, for fairness sake, anyone who thinks that he&rsquo;s more worthy of Zi Ling can opt to enter the Hidden Dragon Life Tower too. If two people break Dugu Lingtian&rsquo;s record, the one with the better score would be deemed more worthy.&rdquo;<br>With those words, the sectmaster took her leave.<br>A huge uproar immediately occurred right afterward.<br>Her words were very clear. Chu Feng had proposed breaking the Hidden Dragon Life Tower on his own accord, and the deal was that he would be able to wed Zi Ling if he succeeded. Anyone who carried objections could challenge the record too.<br>That was exactly what the crowd was talking about. They looked at Chu Feng with a complicated look in their eyes.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you out of your mind? Why are you entering the Hidden Dragon Life Tower for no reason?!&rdquo; Xia Yan exclaimed in bewilderment.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t just her who felt this way. Li Muzhi and the others also rushed to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side as well.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk over at my place,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he stood up and headed toward his residence.<br>&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Can you tell me the reason behind your decision now? Are you out of your mind?!&rdquo;<br>As soon as they stepped into Chu Feng&rsquo;s residence, Xia Yan demanded an explanation from him.<br>&ldquo;Would you believe me if I were to say that I have no other choice?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a bitter smile.<br>&ldquo;No other choice? What do you mean?&rdquo; Xia Yan asked.<br>Chu Feng quickly explained everything that had happened yesterday to Xia Yan and the others.<br>&ldquo;Why would the sectmaster pick on you?&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan felt incredibly frustrated. It would be one thing if it was anyone else who was making things difficult for Chu Feng, but there was nothing they could do if the person was the sectmaster herself.<br>&ldquo;Rather than that, you should tell me what kind of place the Hidden Dragon Life Tower is,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You agreed to the deal without knowing what kind of place the Hidden Dragon Life Tower is?!&rdquo; Xia Yan exclaimed in bewilderment.<br>She looked at Chu Feng as if she was looking at an utter dimwit.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, I have no idea,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; I thought that you were a smart person, but you&rsquo;re really dumber than I thought!&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan was so angry that she began stomping her leg. Despite this, she still began to explain to Chu Feng what kind of place the Hidden Dragon Life Tower was.<br>To put it simply, it was a place of service.<br>All elders and disciples, regardless of whether they were terminally ill or at the end of their lifespan, right before their death, they would all enter the Hidden Dragon Life Tower. The tower would absorb their cultivation and origin energy once they died, converting it into energy to power the formations of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br></p></div>
