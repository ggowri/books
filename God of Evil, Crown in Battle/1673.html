        <h1>Chapter 1672</h1>
        <div> - Wiping Away Former Shame<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>The stream of water was unstoppable. The moment it came out, overflowing waves of water surged forth, destroying all things in its path. How could this possibly be water? This was simply a magnificent army of celestial troops and generals capable of toppling cities.<br>The waves of water possessed might capable of toppling the mountains and overturning the seas, destroying mountain ranges and splitting the vast earth apart.<br>Being attacked by this sort of water waves, even though Du Wanwu&rsquo;s poison gas was very strong, it was still broken through by the waves of water.<br>Not only that, the Water Immortal Profound Technique had appeared in an instant. With overflowing water, it possessed the might of a rank five Half Martial Emperor, and a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation as it charged to ferociously attack Du Wanwu.<br>At this moment, there was simply no need for Chu Feng to act himself. Merely his Water Immortal Profound Technique was capable of fighting against Du Wanwu.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; your cultivation actually increased?!!!&rdquo; Faced with such ferocious attacks from the Water Immortal Profound Technique, Du Wanwu was greatly shocked.<br>This was the first time Chu Feng had seen a shocked expression on Du Wanwu&rsquo;s face.<br>However, his shock was understandable. After all, even if he wanted to remain calm, it would be impossible to do so. When Chu Feng attacked, Du Wanwu was able to sense that Chu Feng&rsquo;s current aura was completely different from before.<br>Chu Feng had reached a breakthrough and obtained a battle power on par with his own.<br>&ldquo;What?! He actually reached a breakthrough?!&rdquo;<br>After finding out that Chu Feng had obtained a breakthrough, the other people from the Du Clan were extremely frightened. They all knew very well that Chu Feng had been defeated by their Lord Clan Chief last time around because his cultivation was inferior to their Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s.<br>However now, although Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was still inferior to their Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s, Chu Feng possessed a heaven-defying battle power one level above their Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s. As such, the two of them were equally matched. If they were to fight again, the outcome of the battle would be very hard to determine.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng possessed a body immune to poisons. Thus, Du Clan&rsquo;s pride, their poisons, especially Du Wanwu&rsquo;s Divine Poison, was useless against Chu Feng. As such, all of the advantages that they possessed were now gone.<br>This battle&hellip; would likely lead to disaster.<br>In fact, their worries were not baseless. After Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation increased, the Water Immortal Profound Technique&rsquo;s cultivation had also increased.<br>With the activation of his<br>Lightning<br>Armor and<br>Lightning<br>Wings, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation went from rank two Half Martial Emperor to rank four Half Martial Emperor.<br>However, the Water Immortal Profound Technique&rsquo;s cultivation was a level above Chu Feng&rsquo;s. At this moment, the Water Immortal Profound Technique possessed a cultivation of rank five Half Martial Emperor, and a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation; it was at the same level as Du Wanwu.<br>Furthermore, the Water Immortal Profound Technique was said to be one of the strongest secret skills. Its reputation was not undeserved, as its attacks were extremely valiant, and it possessed an undying body.<br>Even though Du Wanwu possessed overflowing battle power and countless techniques, he was still helpless against such a troublesome opponent. At this moment, Du Wanwu was covered with sweat.<br>&ldquo;Du Wanwu, you must try harder. If you do not put forth more effort and reveal stronger techniques, I will start killing your clansmen,&rdquo; Chu Feng acted as if he was a bystander in the battle, and spoke to Du Wanwu while smiling beamingly.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t you act arrogant! Even if you possess the same battle power as me, it does not necessarily mean that I, Du Wanwu, will be defeated by you.&rdquo;<br>Du Wanwu shouted angrily. Then, purple veined patterns that glimmered with light appeared on his body.<br>When that purple veined pattern appeared, Du Wanwu&rsquo;s aura actually rose dramatically. Then, he began to frantically unleash counterattacks at the Water immortal Profound Technique.<br>&ldquo;Boom, boom, boom, boom~~~&rdquo;<br>This time around, Du Wanwu stopped using poison gas to attack. Instead, he used his martial power. With fists and kicks, Du Wanwu smashed apart the Water Immortal Profound Technique.<br>&ldquo;Have you finally gotten serious? Last time around, I was defeated by that. This time, I will not be defeated again.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled lightly, then retracted the Water Immortal Profound Technique and unleashed his Four Great Secret Skills, the White Tiger, Azure Dragon, Vermillion Bird and Black Tortoise. After the Four Great Secret Skills fused with him, Chu Feng unleashed attacks at Du Wanwu. Chu Feng was planning to personally fight against Du Wanwu and obtain victory over him.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s speed was extremely fast. In an instant, he had arrived before Du Wanwu. Without using any martial skills, he attacked with his fists and feet. He was planning to fight Du Wanwu physically.<br>Chu Feng knew very well that Du Wanwu&rsquo;s battle power had become extremely strong after that purple veined pattern appeared on his skin. Not only that, his body had also been strengthened.<br>Last time around, when Chu Feng was defeated by Du Wanwu, the hole in his chest was not something that was caused by Du Wanwu with martial skills or weapons. Instead, it was caused by Du Wanwu&rsquo;s fist. Du Wanwu had shot through Chu Feng&rsquo;s body with his fist.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was tempered by his Divine Lightnings. Ever since his youth, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was very strong. He had been capable of contending against monstrous beasts using his body. There had never been a time when his body was penetrated by someone&rsquo;s fist.<br>Thus, the defeat last time around was a humiliation to Chu Feng. This time around, Chu Feng was planning to wipe away his former shame.<br>&ldquo;Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng became more and more ferocious as the battle went on. His speed, his power and even his offensive techniques all surpassed Du Wanwu&rsquo;s.<br>His every fist was capable of shattering space. His every kick was capable of twisting space.<br>In this sort of situation, the only thing Du Wanwu could do was retreat repeatedly. With a slight misstep, Du Wanwu ended up receiving two fist strikes from Chu Feng.<br>Even though those two fist strikes did not penetrate through Du Wanwu&rsquo;s body, the locations where they hit were badly mutilated with flesh ripped apart.<br>At this moment, Du Wanwu finally became aware of how powerful Chu Feng was. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was a level weaker before, there was simply no way for him to be able to defeat Chu Feng. Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength had already surpassed his imagination.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng used the boots on his foot as well as the Azure Dragon Dashing Technique to increase his speed to a frightening level. In a flash, he arrived behind Du Wanwu. His fist instantly shot forth with the increased power of the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique and landed on Du Wanwu&rsquo;s back.<br>At this moment, a &lsquo;puu,&rsquo; sound was heard. Then, Du Wanwu screamed in pain. A large amount of blood splattered. Chu Feng&rsquo;s fist had pierced through Du Wanwu&rsquo;s body; pierced through his chest.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>After penetrating Du Wanwu&rsquo;s chest with his fist, Chu Feng suddenly waved his arm and sent Du Wanwu flying. In the end, Du Wanwu ruthlessly smashed into the wall of their Du Clan&rsquo;s cave.<br>The throw was done with a great amount of power. A large explosion was heard when Du Wanwu smashed into the wall. Furthermore, Du Wanwu was smashed thousands of meters into the wall and entered deep into the mountain.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief!!!&rdquo;<br>The people from the Du Clan were endlessly worried and scared when they saw this scene. The worry that they had, had become the reality. When Chu Feng possessed the same battle power as their Lord Clan Chief, their Lord Clan Chief was no match for Chu Feng.<br>If their Lord Clan Chief was someone akin to god in their heart, then Chu Feng would be a man stronger than even their god. As such, how could they possibly not be afraid of Chu Feng?<br>&ldquo;Du Wanwu, I might as well tell you this. Even though I, Chu Feng, am from the Holy Land of Martialism, I am not from the Three Palaces.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I entered here purely by coincidence. The reason why I&rsquo;ve come to find you all is all because of your mistreatment of the people here. I merely came here to speak for them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Else, why do you think that the people of your clan would all be alive even now?&rdquo; After obtaining dominance, Chu Feng suddenly said those words.<br>The people from the Du Clan already wanted to kill Chu Feng. However, Chu Feng had never had the intention to kill them.<br>This was not because Chu Feng was compassionate or lenient, because he was definitely not a compassionate or lenient person. In fact, before he came here, he had had the notion of wiping out the Du Clan.<br>However, after he saw the people of the Du Clan, Chu Feng did not want to kill them.<br>Especially after these past twenty days. Even though Chu Feng had been trapped in the Poison Refinement Formation, he was able to sense what was happening outside. He was able to see how the people from the Du Clan got along with one another.<br>Even though the Du Clan could not be considered to be large when compared to the other large clans in the Holy Land of Martialism, they still numbered close to ten thousand people with all the old and young combined.<br>A clan close to ten thousand people was, no matter how one looked at it, definitely not a small number.<br>Inevitably, for a clan, and especially a large clan, people who had their own special interests, disputes were inevitable.<br>But&hellip; a clan like the Du Clan was actually filled with empathy toward their kinsmen and nothing else.<br>Everyone from the Du Clan, regardless of whether they were old or young, all viewed Du Wanwu as a god. They were all extremely loyal to him. The rest of the Du Clan did not have any intention to strive for leadership and benefits. They lived very harmoniously with one another.<br>Something like this was very rarely seen. Chu Feng felt that, regardless of how they treated outsiders, as they were a family that viewed blood to be thicker than water, he should not eliminate them and, instead, should let them live.<br>That was why Chu Feng wanted to reason with them so that they would treat the villagers better and reconcile this matter.<br></p></div>
