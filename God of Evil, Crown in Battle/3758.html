        <div> - The Power Of The Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Am I seeing things? This aura, it seems to be the aura of Utmost Exalted-level existences?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistake. I&rsquo;m also able to sense it. They are all Utmost Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What are those? They actually all possess Utmost Exalted-level cultivations?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the army of Utmost Exalted-level guardian spirits half-kneeling before Chu Feng, the crowd felt completely astonished. At the same time, they were unable to contain the fear in their hearts.<br>Afraid. They would naturally be afraid. After all, those were ten thousand Utmost Exalted-level existences.<br>The crowd all knew very well what ten thousand Utmost Exalted-level existences represented.<br>&ldquo;What is it that you&rsquo;re holding in your hand?&rdquo; Linghu Zhishi asked as he looked at the silver halberd in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>The crowd were all able to tell that the ten thousand Utmost Exalted-level existences were all being controlled by the silver halberd in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>It was a rare treasure. Should one possess that treasure, it would be equivalent to controlling an army of Utmost Exalted.<br>Thus, Linghu Zhishi really wanted to know exactly what that treasure was.<br>Before Chu Feng could answer, Grandmaster Liangqiu answered, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd?!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the already astonished crowd all gasped with astonishment.<br>After all, the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd was renowned throughout the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield. Everyone knew about it.<br>It was also precisely because the crowd knew how exceptional an item the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd was that they were skeptical that Chu Feng&rsquo;s halberd was it.<br>After all, the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd was hidden within the Mirror Sea. As for the Mirror Sea, the crowd all knew how dangerous a place it was.<br>That place was deemed to be one of the most dangerous places in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Could Chu Feng really have obtained such a legendary item?<br>Seemingly sensing the skepticism of the crowd, Grandmaster Liangqiu repeated himself. &ldquo;Indeed, that is the Mirror Sea&rsquo;s Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd!&rdquo;<br>After Grandmaster Liangqiu repeated himself, the crowd all opened their mouths wide with shock.<br>At the same time, the gazes with which they looked at Chu Feng had changed again.<br>He had simply shocked them too many times in one day.<br>He had defeated Linghu Hongfei, unleashed a heaven-defying spirit formation, and then revealed the legendary Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd too.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s performance had far surpassed the crowd&rsquo;s expectations. In fact, he had smashed the crowd&rsquo;s imaginations.<br>&ldquo;I truly never would&rsquo;ve imagined that you actually obtained even the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, do you actually think that you&rsquo;re able to win against me using only those things?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re a cultivator yourself. How could you not understand that the disparity between cultivation is not something that numbers can make up for?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, I will have you, Chu Feng, die with understanding. I will have you witness how your rank one Utmost Exalted are completely useless before me.&rdquo;<br>As Linghu Zhishi spoke, his clothes fluttered, and his overwhelming oppressive might started surging towards Chu Feng with a power capable of toppling mountains and overturning seas.<br>At that moment, he was no longer using his oppressive might to scare Chu Feng. Instead, he had truly used his oppressive might to attack him.<br>At that moment, the crowd were all able to witness how powerful a rank two Utmost Exalted was.<br>Even though an army of ten thousand Utmost Exalted was extremely astonishing, those Utmost Exalted guardian spirits appeared very small and weak by comparison.<br>This was a match with a massive disparity in strength.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, silvery light started to shine brightly, illuminating the surroundings.<br>As that silvery light filled the surroundings, Linghu Zhishi&rsquo;s oppressive might was forcibly suppressed.<br>Seeing that, the first reaction of the crowd was to look at Gu Mingyuan.<br>After all, she was the only person that they felt to be remotely capable of contending against Linghu Zhishi.<br>However, when the crowd looked to Gu Mingyuan, they discovered that she had a look of bewilderment on her face. This meant that she was not the one who had blocked Linghu Zhishi&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>Thus, the crowd all turned their gazes to Chu Feng, who stood beside her.<br>The dazzling silvery light was being emitted from him.<br>Upon doing so, the crowd were astonished to discover that it was actually Chu Feng who had blocked Linghu Zhishi&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>The current Chu Feng was not only emitting the same sort of silvery light as the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd, but even his aura was identical to the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd. The current Chu Feng seemed to have fused with the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.<br>Most importantly, the aura Chu Feng currently emitted was that of a rank two Utmost Exalted!!!<br>&ldquo;You still don't understand the true power of the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, that cannot be blamed on you. After all, one can only sense its true power while holding it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Linghu Zhishi.<br>What Chu Feng said was the truth. When Chu Feng saw the Ox-nosed Old Daoist holding the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd back then, he, like the crowd now, only thought the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd&rsquo;s power to be an army of ten thousand Utmost Exalted guardian spirits.<br>However, after holding the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd, Chu Feng discovered that it was much more powerful.<br>Even though he was only granted the power of a rank two Utmost Exalted by the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd at that moment, Chu Feng was able to sense that rank two Utmost Exalted was most definitely not its true power.<br>It was merely that he could not handle its true power.<br>It was like the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd had said to him before.<br>Chu Feng had only gained a preliminary acknowledgement from it. Thus, he could not grasp its full power.<br>That said, even though it was only the cultivation of a rank two Utmost Exalted, it was already sufficient for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let us take care of him together.&rdquo;<br>As Gu Mingyuan spoke, she planned to take the forbidden medicines she held in her hand to assist Chu Feng.<br>However, before she could put the forbidden medicines in her mouth, all of the forbidden medicines shattered.<br>They were all destroyed.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what are you doing?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, Gu Mingyuan looked to Chu Feng, who stood beside her.<br>She knew that it was Chu Feng who had destroyed those forbidden medicines.<br>Those forbidden medicines were their hope. Now that he had destroyed them, it was equivalent to having ruined their hope.<br>Because of that, Gu Mingyuan was slightly angry. She was unable to understand why he would do such a thing.<br>Although Chu Feng was able to tell that Gu Mingyuan was angry, he did not fluster. Instead, he smiled.<br>&ldquo;Senior, there&rsquo;s no need for you to act to take care of him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Please go and rest. Allow me to take care of this clan chief.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng turned his gaze to Linghu Zhishi. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you, I will kill you personally.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing those words, Linghu Zhishi let out a mocking laugh.<br>He said, &ldquo;Even rank two Utmost Exalted differ in strength. Obtaining the power of a rank two Utmost Exalted through the use of a weapon is no different from Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s rank two Utmost Exalted power that she obtained from her bloodline power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, since you have such a deathwish, I will let you witness the true power of a rank two Utmost Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Linghu Zhishi finished saying those words, his expression changed enormously.<br>He was astonished to discover that Chu Feng had disappeared.<br>When Chu Feng reappeared, he was right in front of Linghu Zhishi.<br>The Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand streaked across the sky and swept towards him.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>The halberd struck. Linghu Zhishi was sent flying.<br>Everything had happened too quickly. The crowd were simply unable to see the details of what had happened.<br>After everything was over, the crowd noticed that Chu Feng was standing where Linghu Zhishi stood previously.<br>As for Linghu Zhishi, he had retreated several tens of thousands of meters away.<br>Furthermore, a bloody wound was present on his chest.<br></p></div>
