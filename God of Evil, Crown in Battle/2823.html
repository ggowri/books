        <h1>Chapter 2822</h1>
        <div> - Loyalty Three Brothers<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master clenched his fist. Then, martial power started to extend from his clenched fist. In the blink of an eye, his martial power turned into a blade.<br>That blade was composed of actual Immortal-level martial power. Thus, it was extremely powerful.<br>The Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master handed that martial power blade to Yuwen Tingyi, &ldquo;Son, I&rsquo;ll leave this Li Xiang to you.&rdquo;<br>Yuwen Tingyi received the blade and then aimed it at Li Xiang. He began to fiddle with the blade, and then abruptly sliced toward Li Xiang&rsquo;s neck with it.<br>That blade was made up of a Martial Immortal&rsquo;s martial power.<br>Even though Yuwen Tingyi was already a cripple without cultivation, if that blade was to slice at Li Xiang&rsquo;s neck, not only would Li Xiang be decapitated, but he would also die on the spot.<br>The reason for that was because that blade was capable of destroying Li Xiang&rsquo;s soul.<br>Seeing this, Chu Feng immediately shouted hysterically, &ldquo;Stop!!!&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng shouted, Yuwen Tingyi&rsquo;s blade actually stopped at Li Xiang&rsquo;s neck.<br>However, Yuwen Tingyi did not bother to pay attention to Chu Feng. Instead, he turned the blade around and handed the handle to Li Xiang.<br>&ldquo;Kill that Chu Feng. Do that, and you&rsquo;ll be a member of our Yuwen City from now on,&rdquo; Yuwen Tingyi said to Li Xiang.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The people from the Sacred Pellet Villa were all startled to hear those words. They had never expected Yuwen Tingyi to be so malevolent.<br>He actually wanted Li Xiang to kill Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; as for Li Xiang, he actually agreed to it without the slightest hesitation.<br>&ldquo;Li Xiang, you can&rsquo;t do that. How could you attack big brother Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Li Xiang, I have truly misjudged you. It was all because of you that big brother Chu Feng offended the people from Yuwen City. How could you kick your benefactor in the teeth?&rdquo;<br>Once Li Xiang said those words, he immediately angered the Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s younger generations. They all began to curse out at Li Xiang.<br>Even Li Xiang&rsquo;s two best friends were no exception. They too were cursing at Li Xiang.<br>However, Li Xiang had a determined expression. It was as if he had already made his resolution.<br>Seeing this, the corners of Yuwen Tingyi&rsquo;s mouth lifted into a sneer. He looked to Chu Feng with a mocking and hatred-filled gaze, &ldquo;Do you see this? This is the person you were protecting. Do you think this is worth it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, never regret anything that I&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;<br>Hearing what Chu Feng said, Yuwen Tingyi&rsquo;s expression immediately twisted. He said to Li Xiang, &ldquo;Kill him!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master had retrieved his oppressive might that was restricting Li Xiang&rsquo;s movement, giving Li Xiang the freedom to move.<br>Li Xiang received the martial power blade. He did not immediately turn around to face Chu Feng.<br>Instead, he carefully inspected the blade.<br>Unable to contain himself, he admired, &ldquo;Martial Immortals are truly powerful. To be able to die by the hands of a Martial Immortal, I, Li Xiang, have not lived my life in vain.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Li Xiang suddenly raised the blade he held in his hand and hacked down toward Yuwen Tingyi.<br>It turned out that Li Xiang simply did not have any plan to kill Chu Feng at all. He had agreed to Yuwen Tingyi merely so that he could attempt to kill him.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a loud explosion was heard. Li Xiang&rsquo;s body shattered into pieces. He had exploded.<br>It was the Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master. Without even moving, he had killed Li Xiang with a mere thought.<br>At that moment, the crowd finally realized why Li Xiang would say that he had not lived his life in vain to die by the hands of a Martial Immortal.<br>It turned out that Li Xiang had already anticipated this outcome. He knew that he would not be able to play his trick successfully before a Martial Immortal-level expert.<br>However, even with that being the case, he must still do it. This was what Li Xiang had decided.<br>&ldquo;You bastard!!!&rdquo;<br>After a moment of silence, a furious shout was heard.<br>It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng&rsquo;s face had turned blue. Anger was written all over his face. His sinister appearance resembled that of a wild beast. It was truly frightening.<br>However, he was facing a Martial Immortal, an existence that could drown him to death with a single spit.<br>The Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master simply did not place Chu Feng in his eyes. He extended his palm and brought one of Li Xiang&rsquo;s good friends toward his son.<br>&ldquo;Kill Chu Feng. Not only will I spare your life, I will also guarantee you glory, splendor, wealth and rank.&rdquo;<br>Yuwen Tingyi turned the handle of the martial power blade toward Li Xiang&rsquo;s good friend.<br>That person was one of the two people that had beaten up that female serpent monstrous beast and then started addressing Chu Feng as big brother.<br>&ldquo;Pah!&rdquo;<br>That man spit at Yuwen Tingyi&rsquo;s face. However, before his spit could reach Yuwen Tingyi, it froze in midair.<br>The reason for this was naturally because of the Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master.<br>With him there, even though Yuwen Tingyi was already a cripple, no one would be able to cause him the slightest bit of harm.<br>&ldquo;Courting death.&rdquo;<br>Yuwen Tingyi held the martial power blade and slashed down. With a snap, blood splattered everywhere.<br>Li Xiang&rsquo;s good friend, Chu Feng&rsquo;s little brother, was decapitated. His body was still kneeling before Yuwen Tingyi. However, his head was already falling toward the ground.<br>&ldquo;You animal! If you have the ability, then aim at me! I am the one who crippled Yuwen Tingyi and Yuwen Hualong! This matter is unrelated to them! Let them go! Do not willfully slaughter the innocent!&rdquo; Chu Feng shouted hysterically.<br>Not only was Chu Feng&rsquo;s face filled with anger, there was also pain.<br>Chu Feng was capable of enduring all kinds of torture. However, he was unable to endure others dying because of him.<br>This sort of torment to his heart was something that he found the most unbearable. It was also something that caused him to feel such enormous grief that he would want to die.<br>&ldquo;Are you feeling pain now? Don&rsquo;t be so anxious, this is merely the beginning.&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng in such pain, the Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master revealed an ice-cold smile.<br>Then, with a thought, Li Xiang&rsquo;s other good friend also flew toward Yuwen Tingyi.<br>&ldquo;Wait! Don&rsquo;t kill me, don&rsquo;t kill me!&rdquo;<br>That person immediately started shouting hysterically upon arriving beside Yuwen Tingyi.<br>&ldquo;I can spare your life. As long as you kill Chu Feng, I will spare your life,&rdquo; Yuwen Tingyi said.<br>&ldquo;Okay. Let me go, let me go first,&rdquo; that man said.<br>Yuwen Tingyi took a glance at his father. The Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master retrieved his oppressive might and restored that man&rsquo;s freedom.<br>That man got up, turned around and looked to Chu Feng. He said, &ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, I have yet to tell you my name. I am called Ma Qiang. The one who just died is called Gao Hao. The two of us and big brother Li Xiang have a nickname in the Sacred Pellet Villa. We are known as the Three Loyal Brothers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although the three of us have only known big brother Chu Feng for a very short period of time, we truly and sincerely wanted to befriend big brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, big brother Chu Feng, please remember. In our hearts, you will always be our big brother. We are honored by you. Even in death, you will still be our big brother.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although we&rsquo;ve met one another very late in life, we shall become brothers again in death.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, that Ma Qiang suddenly turned around and pounced at Yuwen Tingyi.<br>However, right after he turned around, he became completely immobile, as if petrified.<br>Once again, he had his movement restricted by the Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master.<br>&ldquo;Motherfucker! Loyal Three Brothers? I&rsquo;ll show you loyalty.&rdquo;<br>Yuwen Tingyi brandished the blade in his hand and hacked down at Ma Qiang.<br>Following a &lsquo;puu,&rsquo; blood splattered everywhere. Ma Qiang suffered the same fate as Gao Hao. He had been decapitated by Yuwen Tingyi.<br><br><br></p></div>
