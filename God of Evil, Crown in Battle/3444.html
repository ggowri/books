        <h1>Chapter 3443</h1>
        <div> - Saint-cloak Battle Power<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior, could it be that this is caused by the backlash?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with concern.<br>&ldquo;The backlash this time is very serious. It seems that the intensity of the backlash is stronger the more one has gained. However, compared to young friend Chu Feng, I will be able to recover after nursing myself for some time. It is nothing serious.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chengfeng has already explained your situation to me. Come, let me have a look at your circumstances,&rdquo; As Grandmaster Liangqiu spoke, he released boundless spirit power from within him. His spirit power instantly engulfed Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It is indeed a bit difficult to deal with. Had it been the me from before, I would truly not be able to do anything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fortunately, I am now a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Thus, young friend, you don&rsquo;t have to worry. I should be able to help you remove that seal,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu said.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, I am truly sorry about this. You&rsquo;ve also received a backlash, yet I&rsquo;m making you treat me,&rdquo; Chu Feng had an apologetic expression on his face.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu sighed and said, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, it is all thanks to you that this old man was able to become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, and Chengfeng a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, it is actually also because of us that your cultivation ended up being sealed. As such, how could this old man ignore the matter?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, you can&rsquo;t say it like that. After all, I have also gained from the breaching of the grand&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s no need for civilities. Come, sit down, and this old man will help you remove the seal on your body right away,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, thank you for your trouble.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng no longer said anything. He clasped his fist at Grandmaster Liangqiu, and then sat down cross-legged.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng sat down, the spirit power within Grandmaster Liangqiu erupted like a tide. In an instant, it filled the entire palace hall.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s seal was very difficult to remove. Even though it was Grandmaster Liangqiu helping Chu Feng to remove the seal, even though Grandmaster Liangqiu spent an entire day, Chu Feng&rsquo;s seal&hellip; was still not completely removed.<br>That said, Chu Feng began to regain his cultivation, and the seal on his spirit power was also weakening.<br>Although the recovery of both his cultivation and spirit power were not particularly fast, they were at least recovering.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I am truly grateful for your help,&rdquo; Chu Feng had a very thankful expression.<br>&ldquo;This old man&rsquo;s capability is limited. I am unable to completely remove your seal. It will still require some time for young friend to recover completely.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, for the sake of not delaying your participation in the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, I have made some suitable adjustments to allow you to utilize more of your sealed spirit power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If nothing unexpected is to occur, by the time the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars arrives, even if you are unable to recover your spirit power to how it was before, you will still be able to utilize a bit of your power as a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that Linghu Hongfei will not be participating in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars this time around. Thus, young friend Chu Feng, as long as you recover your Saint-level spirit power, the first place amongst the Ancestral Martial Decastars will definitely be yours,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, you mean to say that&hellip; I will be able to defeat everyone else using only the power of a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, using only my world spirit techniques?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was surprised by Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s words.<br>Chu Feng knew how powerful world spirit techniques were. Should a world spiritist spend the effort and time to set up a spirit formation, it would be very difficult for a martial cultivator to deal with it.<br>However, in a match against martial cultivators, what they competed in was direct battle power.<br>Although world spirit techniques possessed a certain amount of offensive power, they could not compare against the battle power of martial cultivators.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, it would appear that you&rsquo;ve yet to properly feel the power of a Saint-cloak World Spiritist,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng immediately released his spirit power and began to carefully feel it.<br>Upon doing so, his expression changed enormously. A pleasantly surprised look filled his eyes.<br>The battle power contained within Chu Feng&rsquo;s current spirit power was actually comparable to that of a rank five Martial Immortal.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this is&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng looked at Grandmaster Liangqiu with shock on his face.<br>One must know that what Chu Feng had sensed was pure spirit power that had yet to be altered and strengthened through spirit formations.<br>If ordinary spirit power was already that powerful, one could very well imagine how powerful it would be after being used in spirit formations techniques.<br>&ldquo;Your spirit power is still sealed. Although you are able to connect with your Saint-level spirit power, the purity of the spirit power is of a different caliber.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As a cultivator, you should know that the power and intensity of one&rsquo;s martial power determines one&rsquo;s own strength. Spirit power is the same,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu said.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, you mean to say that once my spirit power is unsealed, it will become even stronger?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Although Chu Feng had trained in world spirit techniques for many years, he did not know much about Saint-level spirit power.<br>In fact, apart from hearing about Saint-cloak World Spiritists and knowing that they were definitely existences that were more powerful than Exalted-cloak World Spiritists, Chu Feng knew nothing else about them.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than powerful,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu chuckled, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put it this way. Chu Feng, if your seal is completely removed, and you are able to perfectly utilize your Saint-level spirit power, no one apart from Exalted-level experts would be a match for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are able to utilize your world spirit techniques skillfully, you would even be able to contend against a rank one Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, are you serious?&rdquo; Shock filled Chu Feng&rsquo;s face. He became so excited that even his hair began to stand on end.<br>Chu Feng had been training in both his world spirit techniques and martial cultivation simultaneously the entire time. Furthermore, he was very talented amongst his peers in both of them. Especially his world spirit techniques; it could even be said that Chu Feng&rsquo;s attainments in world spirit techniques were even more outstanding than his attainments in martial cultivation.<br>His attainments in terms of world spirit techniques had always surpassed his peers. It had always been only the people from the older generation that could measure against Chu Feng in terms of world spirit techniques.<br>It had always been said that Chu Feng was a demon-level genius martial cultivator. However, by comparison, Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques were actually of an even higher demon-level genius caliber.<br>Unfortunately, world spirit techniques were truly lacking in terms of battle power, and simply could not be placed on par with martial cultivation.<br>Thus, after learning that his world spirit techniques&rsquo; battle power had actually surpassed his martial power, Chu Feng naturally felt very surprised.<br>After all, if his world spirit techniques had reached a level where no one apart from Exalted-level experts could contend against him, the difference in power between his world spirit techniques and martial cultivation would simply be massive.<br>&ldquo;If being a Saint-cloak World Spiritist does not even possess that bit of battle power, then the reputation of Saint-cloak World Spiritists would be completely unwarranted,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu actually said those words in a very helpless manner. He was sighing with sorrow at how weak the battle power of world spirit techniques were.<br>Although his response was spoken with a helpless tone, it had answered Chu Feng&rsquo;s question.<br>Sure enough, Chu Feng&rsquo;s current world spirit techniques&rsquo; battle power had surpassed his martial cultivation&rsquo;s battle power.<br>He&hellip; was finally able to fight against martial cultivators as a world spiritist.<br>Just thinking about it made him excited.<br>He felt as if all his blood were surging.<br></p></div>
