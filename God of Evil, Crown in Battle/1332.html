        <div> - Leaving For A Journey<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;What? Chu Feng?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Have Chu Feng become the head of the Colorful Bamboo Forest?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How, how, how&hellip; how could this be fine?&rdquo;<br>Once Hong Qiang said those words, the crowd immediately burst into an uproar. Not a single person present wasn&rsquo;t stunned and shocked by those words.<br>Never would they ever have imagined that Hong Qiang would give such an important position, the position of the head of the Colorful Bamboo Forest, to a disciple.<br>Furthermore, it would be one thing if he was to give the position to a disciple with experience and qualifications. However, this disciple that he had given the position to was a nominal disciple that had only joined the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest several days ago. This was simply too inappropriate.<br>At this time, everyone had turned their gazes to Chu Feng. Their gazes contained unconcealed admiration and envy.<br>However, faint amounts of barely discernible hatred was also contained within their gazes. Naturally, there was also a faint amount of anger.<br>At this time, the people who were the most unwilling to accept this were the four heads of the Golden, Silver, Copper and Iron Bamboo Forests, along with the many management elders of the Colorful Bamboo Forest.<br>They were the people with the highest qualifications to take up the post of the Colorful Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s head. At the same time, they were also the people who wanted to become the head of the Colorful Bamboo Forest the most.<br>Yet, at this time, this position that was below only a single person and above tens of thousands of people was actually seized by Chu Feng, a nominal disciple. What sort of feelings would they be feeling? How could they possibly be willing to accept this?<br>However, even though they were filled with unwillingness, they did not dare to complain in the slightest. It was not that they did not want to say anything. Merely, they did not dare to say anything.<br>In fact, it was not only the crowd that was shocked. Even Chu Feng himself was shocked. He had only come to the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest for the purpose of meeting Hong Qiang. Even his status as a disciple was only nominal.<br>Now that he had met Hong Qiang, he was totally able to cast away his nominal disciple status and return to being a person unrelated to the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest.<br>Yet, at this time, Hong Qiang actually wanted him to become the head of the Colorful Bamboo Forest. This placed Chu Feng in a very difficult position. After all, he needed to return to the Cyanwood Mountain in the future.<br>Upon thinking up to this point, Chu Feng hesitated for a while and then said, &ldquo;Senior Hong Qiang, my talent is too shallow. I fear that I am not up to the task of the important position of the Colorful Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Lord Headmaster, what Chu Feng says is correct. Although he possesses exceptional talent, he is still very young. If he were to become the new head of the Colorful Bamboo Forest, I fear that the masses will not be convinced.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng actually refused the position, the various heads and management elders were immediately overjoyed. Right away, they seized the opportunity to voice their concerns in the hope of dismissing Chu Feng from taking on the position of the Colorful Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s head.<br>However, upon hearing those words, Hong Qiang raised his sharp eyebrows and loudly and intimidatingly shouted, &ldquo;The masses will not be convinced? I shall see who dares to be unconvinced!&rdquo;<br>At this time, the four heads were left speechless, and none of the other people present dared to say anything either. All of them were lowering their heads after being deeply frightened by Hong Qiang.<br>With how powerful Hong Qiang was, being able to completely exterminate all of them, who among them would possibly dare to not be convinced with Chu Feng?<br>Even if they were unconvinced with Chu Feng in their hearts, as long as Hong Qiang was present, none of them dared to say that they were unconvinced with Chu Feng outright.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, be the head of the Colorful Bamboo Forest for the time being. If you really do not wish to continue to be the head in the future, you can stop at any time,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said to Chu Feng. His tone was extremely gentle, it was as if he was trying to compromise with Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words, the crowd from the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest were even more shocked. The attitude Hong Qiang displayed toward Chu Feng was truly so different, enough to make them jealous.<br>It was one thing for a disciple to take on the grand position of the Colorful Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s head. However, Hong Qiang actually said that he could quit at any time. This sort of treatment was truly too special; this Hong Qiang truly pampered Chu Feng.<br>However, what exactly could they do about it? Other than admiring, being jealous and hating Chu Feng, what else could they do? If they had to blame somebody, then they could only blame Chu Feng for having such a good relationship with Hong Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Since senior Hong Qiang says it like this, then Chu Feng will temporarily take on the position of the Colorful Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s head. If senior Hong Qiang is able to find a suitable candidate for the position in the future, Chu Feng will hand the position back,&rdquo; When Hong Qiang said it like that, it was no longer proper for Chu Feng to continue his refusal. Thus, he had no choice but to temporarily become the Colorful Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s head.<br>After all, Hong Qiang deciding to hand such an important position to Chu Feng not only showed that he thought highly of Chu Feng, he was also displaying to everyone that he regarded Chu Feng as being an extremely valuable person.<br>With how Hong Qiang said it, if Chu Feng was to continue to refuse, then he would not be giving Hong Qiang any face.<br>Thus, this matter was settled...<br>Hong Qiang became the new headmaster of the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest, and Chu Feng became the new head of the Colorful Bamboo Forest.<br>However, regardless of whether it was Hong Qiang or Chu Feng, they had actually only taken on their positions in name.<br>The two of them had only taken on those two important positions, but had actually not done anything that was actually related to those positions.<br>Hong Qiang did not begin to really manage the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest. Instead, he handed all of the matters to the various bamboo forest&rsquo;s heads to take care of.<br>As for Chu Feng, he was the same as Hong Qiang. Although he was the head of the Colorful Bamboo Forest and possessed a position below only a single person and above tens of thousands, he handed everything regarding the Colorful Bamboo Forest over to be managed by the Colorful Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s management elders. Like Hong Qiang, he became an arm-flinging shopkeeper. [1. Someone who asks others to work but does nothing himself.]<br>Of course, Chu Feng knew that these elders were not fond of him. Moreover, he himself didn&rsquo;t trust those elders either. Thus, he would naturally not allow these elders to do whatever they wished.<br>Chu Feng set up a set of rules for them. Although he had given them the authority to manage the Colorful Bamboo Forest, they were not allowed to break the rules and do whatever they pleased. Else, if Chu Feng were to discover it, he would not let them off with only a light punishment.<br>Essentially, the management elders became Chu Feng&rsquo;s henchmen and the actual power was still in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands.<br>Other than Hong Qiang and Chu Feng, the status that Li Xiang and Lil Ming possessed in the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest also took a huge leap.<br>Not to mention the disciples, even the elders did not dare to offend the two of them, and instead started to treat them with enormous respect. It was so much so that countless people began to flatter them, trying to worm their way into being friends with them.<br>In an instant, these two disciples of the Discarded Bamboo Forest, the people seen by others as trash, had moved forward by leaps and bounds and become the most popular people, for they possessed a great amount of influence in the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest.<br>As for the reason why this was the case, it was naturally because of Chu Feng. The reason why they could obtain their current status and be respected by everyone was all because of their relationship with Chu Feng.<br>Thus, Li Xiang and Lil Ming were truly pleased and overjoyed by their decision to befriend Chu Feng.<br>However, as the saying goes, when there is someone who is happy, there will be someone who is sad.<br>At this time, when Li Xiang and Lil Ming were rejoicing in their decision to befriend Chu Feng, senior brother Shao and the other former disciples of the Discarded Bamboo Forest who had had the chance to befriend Chu Feng but missed it were filled with endless regret.<br>Senior brother Shao and the others did not leave the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest. Merely, they had lost their status as disciples and had truly become servants.<br>However, there was no one that they could blame for this. After all, these were the consequences of their own actions.<br>As for the other people from the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest, other than the trusted aides of the previous headmaster, the rest of the people were not really affected by the death of the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s headmaster and the Colorful Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s head.<br>All they wished for was for the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest to become even stronger. Regardless of who the headmaster might be, they only wanted the headmaster to be a powerful individual. With how powerful Hong Qiang was, they were actually very willing to have him become the new headmaster.<br>However, as the saying goes, the court changed with the emperor. The change in the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s head had, nevertheless, brought about a great effect to both the inside of the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest and their relationship outside.<br>If the main culprit for all this must be sought for&hellip; then it would be Chu Feng. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Chu Feng, there would never have been such an enormous change in the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest.<br>However, Chu Feng was unconcerned about all of this. After all, he still had a very important matter that he had to attend to. After he handed the responsibilities of being the head of the Colorful Bamboo Forest to the various management elders, Chu Feng left for a journey to the Sealing Ancient Village.<br></p></div>
