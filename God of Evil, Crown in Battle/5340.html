        <h1>Chapter 5341</h1>
        <div>: The Chosen One<br>&ldquo;Senior uncle, is there no way out?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost impossible. It&rsquo;s not a problem about spirit power anymore. That world spirit has burned her own life force away; it&rsquo;s a miracle that she&rsquo;s still alive. A powerful treasure will be needed if you wish for her to make a full recovery. Now that I think about it, there&rsquo;s one treasure that might just be able to alleviate her condition,&rdquo; the one-eyed elder said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, what is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an incredibly rare treasure that boasts great recovery effects on world spirits. You&rsquo;ll know how formidable the treasure is once you see it. However, I should give you a heads-up first.<br>&ldquo;One, the treasure needs to be awakened before it can be used, but that&rsquo;s easier said than done. Many world spiritists, including those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and my senior, have tried awakening it, but to no avail. Due to that, there are hardly any world spiritists who pay it any attention now. A treasure that can&rsquo;t be used is nothing more than a gimmick.<br>&ldquo;Two, your world spirit is simply too severely wounded. It&rsquo;s practically impossible for her to revert back to her previous state. Even the energy harnessed inside that incredible treasure can only alleviate her injuries. A full recovery is out of the question,&rdquo; the one-eyed elder said.<br>Those were despairing words, but Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t fazed in the least.<br>He had known that it would be difficult to treat Eggy. If not for that, he wouldn&rsquo;t have begged Little Crescent so desperately. He also wouldn&rsquo;t have thought about looking for Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Elder, is there a chance for me to obtain that treasure?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t deny that there&rsquo;s a chance. In the Totem Galaxy&rsquo;s Mirrordire Starfield, there&rsquo;s an old man who goes by the surname of Zhou who lives in the Eternalshore Upper Realm&rsquo;s Unageing Peak. The treasure is in his possession. He once said that anyone who has the ability to awaken the treasure will be able to take it away.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite an amicable old man, but just some words of warning, don&rsquo;t underestimate him. He&rsquo;ll allow you to take the treasure if you&rsquo;re able to awaken the treasure, but if not, don&rsquo;t even try to snatch it by force. You&rsquo;ll only be courting your own doom.&rdquo;<br>The one-eyed elder looked at Chu Feng once more.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just say it once more. It&rsquo;s nigh impossible to awaken that treasure. You can go there and try your luck, but I advise you not to harbor any hopes&hellip; Even so, you&rsquo;re still heading there, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the one-eyed elder asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Take this.&rdquo;<br>The one-eyed elder drew out a map indicating the location of Unageing Peak.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for your advice,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he stowed away the map.<br>Even though the one-eyed elder had warned him that the chance was slim, he still wanted to grasp at every straw of hope within reach.<br>&ldquo;Yunqing, let&rsquo;s head back in,&rdquo; the one-eyed elder instructed before returning to the mountain manor.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you go ahead first. I still have some matters to attend to. I&rsquo;ll look for you at the Unageing Peak once I&rsquo;m done,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Bai, go ahead and do what you need to. Don&rsquo;t worry about me. I can settle this problem on my own.&rdquo; Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t want to trouble Bai Yunqing any further.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it won&rsquo;t take too long. Wait for me at the Unageing Peak. I should be able to get there within ten days. Otherwise, don&rsquo;t bother waiting for me anymore,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.<br>&ldquo;Yunqing,&rdquo; the one-eyed elder called from the mountain manor.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s settled then, big brother.&rdquo; Without waiting for Chu Feng&rsquo;s reply, Bai Yunqing headed back into the mountain manor.<br>Chu Feng was put at a loss for words. It was not that he didn&rsquo;t want to wait for Bai Yunqing, but he was simply too anxious to treat Eggy. As a matter of fact, he was planning to head to the Immortal Sea Galaxy right away if he failed to acquire the treasure at the Unageing Peak.<br>When Bai Yunqing returned to the mountain manor, the one-eyed elder was waiting for him right beside the entrance. He bowed to the one-eyed elder and said, &ldquo;Thank you, senior uncle.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Prepare yourself for the tempering,&rdquo; the one-eyed elder urged.<br>&ldquo;Senior uncle, let&rsquo;s skip the tempering and proceed straight to the ritual,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.<br>&ldquo;You want to skip the tempering process?&rdquo; The one-eyed elder was taken aback.<br>&ldquo;Senior uncle, I&rsquo;m in a rush for time. Let&rsquo;s finish it faster this time around,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing replied.<br>&ldquo;Yunqing, I should remind you that the process will be very painful if you don&rsquo;t temper your body first. You might not be able to withstand the pain,&rdquo; the one-eyed elder said.<br>&ldquo;I understand, but I&rsquo;m confident that I&rsquo;ll be able to take it,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re willing to go through so much pain for that brat who saved your life?&rdquo; the one-eyed elder asked. He knew that Bai Yunqing was in a rush because he wanted to journey with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I wish to travel together with him, senior uncle. As you know, I don&rsquo;t have any friends from a young age,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing replied.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, let&rsquo;s get along with it.&rdquo; The one-eyed elder led Bai Yunqing into the depth of the mountain manor.<br>Along the way, Bai Yunqing suddenly halted his footsteps and looked in a direction. He could sense numerous powerful auras and an exceedingly powerful formation there. It was where his master usually went into closed-door training, a place even he was unable to access.<br>&ldquo;Senior uncle, we have guests?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask things you shouldn&rsquo;t ask,&rdquo; the one-eyed elder replied coldly.<br>Bai Yunqing zipped his mouth shut.<br>Soon, the two of them arrived at a huge underground chamber. The chamber looked eerie due to the complicated formation marks and runes that filled its walls. There was a pond and a coffin sitting at the center of the chamber, and the two were linked to each other.<br>The coffin was transparent, but talismans were plastered all over it.<br>A man was lying inside the coffin. He was so emaciated that he looked like a withered corpse, but he was still breathing. Terrifying burn scars could be seen all over his body.<br>The first thing Bai Yunqing did upon entering the chamber was to bow to the man in the coffin before he sat down cross-legged in the pond. The one-eyed elder opened up seven vats of fluids and poured them into the pond.<br>Each of these fluids had a different color, but their stench clearly indicated that they were blood. These were the blood of humans and other races.<br>Bai Yunqing appeared to be already accustomed to it as he didn&rsquo;t raise any complaints.<br>When the seven types of blood finally filled the pond, the one-eyed elder looked at Bai Yunqing and asked, &ldquo;Are you certain that you want to do this without undergoing the tempering?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior uncle, let&rsquo;s begin,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing replied.<br>The one-eyed elder took out a formation token and a formation talisman, holding them in each of his hands.<br>&ldquo;Activate formation!&rdquo;<br>The chamber shook intensely as a stream of light began flowing amidst the darkness. It turned out that the entire chamber was a formation, and the bulk of its power was centered on the pool where Bai Yunqing was seated and the coffin.<br>Gah!<br>Bai Yunqing yelled in pain.<br>Countless long worms inside the pool had squeezed their way into Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s body and furiously squirmed around. It took a mere instant for his face to turn pale, and his skin started to dry up. It was as if he was slowly being sucked dry.<br>Energy flowed out from Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s body into the pool, which then catalyzed the energy and converted it into a stream of gas that flowed into the coffin. The man inside the coffin began furiously absorbing the stream of gas.<br>As Bai Yunqing continued to scream in agony, the complexion of the man inside the coffin slowly reddened.<br>&hellip;<br>Following the one-eyed elder&rsquo;s map, Chu Feng entered a teleportation formation to make his way to the Eternalshore Upper Realm. He channeled his spirit power into the ship and ensured that it was moving at the fastest speed possible.<br>He didn&rsquo;t want to waste even a second if possible.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, connect your consciousness with mine,&rdquo; a feminine voice suddenly echoed in Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>It was the Divine Deer.<br>Chu Feng quickly did as he was told and was transported into the Divine Deer&rsquo;s realm, where he found the Divine Deer standing right in front of him.<br>&ldquo;Now that you have reached Half-God level, I&rsquo;ll impart Divine Flitting to you. Absorbing Divine Flitting will be much harder than absorbing Divine Concealment. You had a taste of it back then, but it was only a fraction of the real thing. This will be the real succession. Make sure to toughen your mind and don&rsquo;t get careless,&rdquo; the Divine Deer said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I am ready.&rdquo; Chu Feng crossed his legs and sat down on the ground.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll begin now.&rdquo;<br>A bundle of white light manifested above the Divine Deer&rsquo;s palm and floated toward Chu Feng. It started attacking Chu Feng as soon as it got close to him.<br>Chu Feng withstood its attack, and before long, he found an opening and started to assimilate its energy. It didn&rsquo;t take him too long to fully absorb the white bundle of light.<br>&ldquo;So fast?&rdquo;<br>The difficulty of cultivating Divine Flitting was much higher than Divine Concealment. While the Divine Deer didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng would face much trouble in the process, she hadn&rsquo;t expected him to succeed that quickly. In fact, he spent less time absorbing Divine Flitting than Divine Concealment!<br>Shoosh!<br>Chu Feng suddenly bolted forth at such a fast speed that he shocked himself. Despite being only at rank one Half-God level, he was moving faster than what he would usually be capable of even after activating his Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings.<br>Even a rank five Half-God level cultivator wouldn&rsquo;t be able to catch up with him.<br>&ldquo;Amazing, Chu Feng! Raise your cultivation rank and give it another try,&rdquo; Eggy said excitedly.<br>Obliging Eggy&rsquo;s request, Chu Feng activated his Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings, raising his cultivation up to rank four Half-God level. He used Divine Flitting in this state, and his speed reached a level where it surpassed rank eight Half-God level cultivators.<br>Once Chu Feng was done experimenting with Divine Flitting, he headed over to the Divine Deer&rsquo;s side and asked, &ldquo;This is amazing! Does this mean that rank eight Half-God level cultivators won&rsquo;t be able to catch up with me anymore?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would be difficult for ordinary rank eight Half-God level cultivators to catch up with you,&rdquo; the Divine Deer replied.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; Chu Feng was overjoyed.<br>Divine Flitting was an additional layer of security for him, allowing him to escape from opponents whom he stood no chance against. If he could raise his cultivation by a few more ranks, no one beneath True God level would be able to threaten his life anymore.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng,&rdquo; the Divine Deer suddenly called out with a grim expression.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, elder?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I know that I have left you to the lurch on many occasions in the past, but it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want to help you. I have to pay a price for exerting my powers too, and there are limitations to what I am able to do.<br>&ldquo;You have already won my acknowledgment, so naturally, I won&rsquo;t turn a blind eye to your plight anymore. I have recovered enough to be able to offer you my help every once in a while. If you encounter problems that are beyond your means, feel free to call me,&rdquo; the Divine Deer said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, elder.&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist and bowed.<br>He had seen what the Divine Deer was capable of. Her absurd speed was one thing, but her oppressive might and formations were equally amazing too. If he could obtain the Divine Deer&rsquo;s help, she would be another strong ally he could turn to during times of danger.<br>&ldquo;You should continue on your way,&rdquo; the Divine Deer said.<br>Teleportation energy enveloped Chu Feng and transported him out of the Divine Deer&rsquo;s realm.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t you think that the deer&rsquo;s attitude toward you has changed?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;Did it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It did. Didn&rsquo;t you notice how friendlier and respectful she was? She used to call you brat, but she&rsquo;s now calling you by your name,&rdquo; Eggy pointed out.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I must have won her acknowledgment with how outstanding I am,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied gleefully.<br>Eggy didn&rsquo;t refute Chu Feng&rsquo;s self-compliment as she thought the same too.<br>Meanwhile, the Divine Deer could hardly conceal the excitement on her face.<br>&ldquo;That brat actually possesses such a formidable bloodline. He must have been chosen by a powerful bloodline&hellip; A person chosen by heaven is bound to be extraordinary. Even back in the Ancient Era, there are only so few people who have been chosen by such powerful bloodlines. I have really picked the right person this time around!&rdquo; the Divine Deer murmured in excitement.<br>She looked as if she had picked up a huge bargain.<br></div>
