        <div> - Do You Need My Assistance?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&lt;/strong&gt;<br>The spirit formation grew more and more powerful. It was as if a bright sun had appeared in the forest as it illuminated the surroundings.<br>At that moment, the power of that spirit formation had reached its peak.<br>&ldquo;Snap~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the twenty four giant beastmen in the spirit formation waved their enormous swords at the pagoda in the middle of the spirit formation in unison.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>As the giant swords struck down, the spirit formation was immediately shattered into a vortex of spirit power that began to spin and revolve in that region as they assimilated into the earth.<br>&ldquo;Crap, we&rsquo;ve been duped!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that scene, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze immediately changed. He had already noticed that the situation was amiss.<br>There was simply no such so-called tomb here. As for the spirit formation that Chu Feng had set up earlier, it seemed to be an unsealing formation. Just then, it seemed to have split open another spirit formation.<br>What was going to be released by that spirit formation?<br>&ldquo;Why did you deceive me?&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed a furious expression as he asked that damned cat.<br>&ldquo;Boy, it seems too late for you to only realize it right now,&rdquo; The damned cat had a half smile of a successful plot on its face.<br>&ldquo;You dared deceive us? I&rsquo;ll kill you,&rdquo; In response, Her Lady Queen immediately unleashed overwhelming killing intent. As she spoke, she planned to rip the old cat in her hand to pieces.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, a roar was heard. Following that, a boundless power surged forth from the ground.<br>At the moment that boundless power appeared, a boundlessly powerful oppressive might surrounded that region of space.<br>At that moment, not to mention Chu Feng, even Her Lady Queen was unable to move in the slightest. The two of them had their movements restricted by that strange yet powerful oppressive might.<br>The next moment, Chu Feng and Eggy were able to see with their naked eyes bodies of energy rushing out from the bottom of the ground and entering that old cat&rsquo;s body.<br>That sort of situation persisted for two entire hours. That region of space only calmed down after two hours passed.<br>Chu Feng and Eggy finally regained their ability to move at that point.<br>However, neither Chu Feng nor Eggy dared to attack the old cat again.<br>Not only did the two of them not dare to attack the old cat, the always violent Lady Queen actually released the old cat of her own accord.<br>The reason for that was because they were able to feel an extremely frightening aura from that old cat. It was an inestimable aura.<br>Powerful, that old cat was extremely powerful. Its strength was many times more powerful than that of the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master. Perhaps that old cat might be a True Immortal-level existence.<br>It was simply no longer a question of whether or not Chu Feng and Eggy wanted to kill the old cat anymore. Rather, they simply did not possess the strength to kill that old cat.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, I will not kill you two. No matter what, the two of you could be considered to have helped me. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the two of you, I would not have been able to regain my cultivation,&rdquo; The old cat said to Chu Feng with a beaming smile.<br>As it spoke, it picked up the tobacco pipe that had fallen to the ground earlier and began to draw smoke from it once again.<br>At that moment, the old cat possessed the strength to instantly kill Chu Feng and Eggy. However, from its appearance, it seemed that the old cat truly did not plan to kill Chu Feng and Eggy.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Frightened to a speechless state?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared. I said that I wouldn&rsquo;t kill you two, so I will definitely not kill you two. After all, this great sir always keeps his promises.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although that damned silly girl was very disrespectful towards this great sir earlier, this great sir has decided to spare her by taking you into consideration boy,&rdquo; The old cat said to Chu Feng.<br>After it finished saying those words, it smiled a profound smile and said, &ldquo;Asura World Spiritist, never would I have imagined that an Asura World Spiritist would appear in this place where even birds don&rsquo;t shit. That is quite rare indeed.&rdquo;<br>[1. Place where even birds don&rsquo;t shit &rarr; extremely desolate place.]<br>&ldquo;Exactly who are you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked. He became even more certain that this old cat was extraordinary. Likely, he would be a grand character.<br>&ldquo;Humph, if I were to tell you who this great sir is, I fear that I will scare you to death. However, in a place like this where even birds don&rsquo;t shit, I bet you&rsquo;ve never heard of this great sir&rsquo;s accomplishments. Thus, I will not bother to tell you about them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You merely need to know that you have helped this great sir earlier,&rdquo; The old cat said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Is the disappearance of Lord Zhan Haichuan&rsquo;s tomb related to you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s related to me. His tomb has been plundered by this great sir. However, this great sir had underestimated him, and ended up being caught by his trap.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fortunately, this great sir is very agile. Only my cultivation ended up being sealed, while my physical body managed to escape. Else, I would&rsquo;ve already been killed,&rdquo; That old cat said.<br>The things spoken by the old cat finally allowed Chu Feng to know the truth.<br>&ldquo;How did you know that Lord Zhan Haichuan&rsquo;s tomb was located here?&rdquo; Chu Feng continued to ask.<br>&ldquo;There is no such thing as a wall that doesn&rsquo;t leak air in this world. Since this great sir wanted to find out where Zhan Haichuan was, I was naturally able to.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Zhan Haichuan was truly a top tier character. Even though he had already been dead for many years, this great sir was still made a fool of by him. From my moment of carelessness, I actually ended up being sealed here by him for over two thousand years.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for the appearance of you, boy, this great sir might have to be trapped here for even longer,&rdquo; The old cat looked to Chu Feng with a beaming smile. His tone was filled with gratefulness.<br>However, facing the old cat&rsquo;s gratefulness, Chu Feng felt a sensation of guilt. As matters stood, he was certain that this old cat was the tomb raider.<br>However, even though this old cat had successfully robbed Zhan Haichuan&rsquo;s tomb, it had also been caught in Zhan Haichuan&rsquo;s spirit formation. This had led to its martial cultivation being sealed and it being trapped here, unable to escape.<br>As for Chu Feng, he had been taken advantage of by this old cat, and ended up undoing the seal on its cultivation to allow it to regain its freedom.<br>Most importantly, this old cat was truly too powerful. Even the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master would not be a match for it.<br>Thus, even though Chu Feng now knew that Zhan Haichuan&rsquo;s tomb had been robbed by this old cat, there was nothing that he or the Sunset Cloud Valley could do to the old cat.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, get the hell out here! Else, I will kill Xu Yiyi and Ning Shuang!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Speak immediately! I know that you&rsquo;re here! Aren&rsquo;t you a loyal and true individual?! Are you planning to watch as your friends meet miserable deaths by my hand?!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, thunderous voices began to sound from the distance. At the beginning, the voices were quite indistinct. However, later on, they grew more and more distinct.<br>Hearing that voice, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression immediately changed. The reason for that was because he was already able to tell that it was Li Rui&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s voice.<br>&ldquo;How could this happen?!&rdquo;<br>Upon sensing that the situation was amiss, Chu Feng hurriedly looked into the distance with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes. Upon inspecting the situation, Chu Feng grew even more nervous.<br>Not only did Chu Feng see Li Rui&rsquo;s master, he also saw Xu Yiyi and Elder Ning Shuang. At that moment, both Xu Yiyi and Elder Ning Shuang were tied up with special chains.<br>Not only were their limbs restricted, the chains were also over their necks. As for the other end of those chains, they were in Li Rui&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s hand.<br>At that moment, Li Rui&rsquo;s master acted as if he were pulling dogs along as he pulled Xu Yiyi and Elder Ning Shuang around.<br>&ldquo;That bastard!&rdquo; Chu Feng was furious. He planned to soar into the sky to confront Li Rui&rsquo;s master.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t go. You will only be throwing your life away,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen grabbed Chu Feng and advised him against it.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, I cannot do nothing,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;But, even if you are to go, you will only be throwing your life away,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;Mn?&rdquo; Seeing the argument between Chu Feng and Eggy, that old cat turned its gaze toward the direction of Li Rui&rsquo;s master. Then, with a beaming smile, it said, &ldquo;Boy, you seem to have encountered troubles. Do you need this great sir&rsquo;s assistance?&rdquo;<br><br></p></div>
