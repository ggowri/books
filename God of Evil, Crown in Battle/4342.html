        <h1>Chapter 4341</h1>
        <div>: Dragon Horns!<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Lord Father, please stop! I&rsquo;m begging you, Chu Feng and Grandmaster Ox didn&rsquo;t lie to you. The Dragon Vein Source is really within my body! I don&rsquo;t know why it can&rsquo;t be detected right now, but it&rsquo;s definitely in there. I can sense its presence!<br>&ldquo;Lord Father, I promise you that I&rsquo;ll do my best to assimilate this energy so as to not let you down, but Chu Feng and his master aren&rsquo;t liars! They are benefactors of the Dragon Clan! Lord Father, you mustn&rsquo;t make things difficult for them!&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao desperately pushed herself off the ground and kneeled on the floor, begging her father desperately.<br>She knew that this was not a lie. The energy was definitely within her body. Even if others couldn&rsquo;t sense it, she was able to feel its presence.<br>&ldquo;Long Xiaoxiao, shut your mouth! You aren&rsquo;t worthy of being a member of the Dragon Clan. I shall teach you a lesson on Lord Father&rsquo;s behalf right now!&rdquo;<br>Long Mumu walked up to Long Xiaoxiao to make a move on her.<br>Chu Feng wanted to stop Long Mumu, but he found that his body wouldn&rsquo;t listen to his command at all.<br>It was the oppressive might from the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. The latter had directed it only toward him and his master, sealing off their movements.<br>So Chu Feng could only watch helplessly as Long Mumu marched up to Long Xiaoxiao and beat her up.<br>Using the same means as her mother, Long Mumu struck Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s face with her hand relentlessly.<br>In this instant, her seemingly fair and slender hand had become the most vicious and vile weapon in the world, raining down blows on Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s face.<br>Pah!<br>Pah!<br>Pah!<br>Such clear sounds exploded loudly in the air, and even the powerful shockwaves that rose as a result of it couldn&rsquo;t conceal the sounds.<br>Soon, Long Xiaoxiao was beaten to the point where her face had become a mishmash of blood and flesh. It was impossible to see through her original appearance anymore.<br>Long Mumu&rsquo;s attacks weren&rsquo;t fatal, but they were aimed to disfigure Long Xiaoxiao and maximize her suffering. It was indeed an extremely vicious move.<br>Yet, no one stepped forward to stop Long Mumu at all.<br>Everyone had implicitly given her their consent to punish Long Xiaoxiao.<br>This made Chu Feng extremely angry.<br>&ldquo;Hahahahaha!&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, a peal of hearty laughter sounded in the air. It was coming from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief of the Dragon Clan, I have already told you that Princess Xiaoxiao is the future of your Dragon Clan, but you still chose to treat her in such a manner. I hope that you don&rsquo;t regret your decision in the future,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke with a light voice.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;ll regret it in the future, but I know for sure that you&rsquo;ll definitely regret daring to make a fool out of our Dragon Clan!&rdquo;<br>Right after saying those words, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief opened his hand, and countless sharp blades could be seen twirling above his palm.<br>While these sharp blades were miniature at the moment, they would morph into the size of a real sword once the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief released them.<br>This was a fact that everyone knew.<br>Long Mumu pummeling Long Xiaoxiao was just the starter.<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was going to make a move, and the ones who would suffer as a result of that were definitely Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>All of a sudden, one of the Supreme Elders shouted out in astonishment. &ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, look at Princess Xiaoxiao. Hurry!&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing those words, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief turned his gaze over, and he saw that Long Xiaoxiao was currently undergoing a transformation.<br>Despite being struck to the point of disfigurement by Long Mumu, there was not even the slightest sound coming out of Long Xiaoxiao. In fact, she didn&rsquo;t dodge Long Mumu&rsquo;s attacks at all, allowing the latter to strike her again and again.<br>Long Xiaoxiao was knocked down by Long Mumu after each and every strike, but she would still rise up right away. It was as if there was a dogged will within her that didn&rsquo;t allow her to bow down and admit defeat.<br>But at this moment, she was lying on the floor, moaning in pain.<br>Her cries sounded so heart-wrenching that it was impossible to imagine just how much pain she was in.<br>&ldquo;Kepp faking! Mere physical pain, and you act as if you&rsquo;re dying. Long Xiaoxiao, I never knew that you had such acting talent in you!&rdquo;<br>Long Mumu wasn&rsquo;t moved to see Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s state at all. Instead, she mocked her mercilessly, using vile words to put her down.<br>&ldquo;Long Xiaoxiao, don&rsquo;t try to garner sympathy! Do you think that the Dragon Clan will let you go just like that?&rdquo;<br>After Long Mumu said those words, she turned to the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief with a smug look on her face.<br>&ldquo;Lord Father, please do not sympathize with this traitor. She has colluded with outsiders to destroy the foundations of our Dragon Clan. She deserves to be executed!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;<br>Who would have thought Long Mumu&rsquo;s words would be faced with a furious bellow from the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief?<br>That wasn&rsquo;t all. The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief even pushed Long Mumu aside before carefully helping Long Xiaoxiao back to her feet. Then, he placed a hand on Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s head and fondled it gently.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, how are you feeling right now? Grandmaster, what&rsquo;s wrong with Xiaoxiao? Save her! Young friend Chu Feng, Xiaoxiao is your friend, right? Help her!&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief suddenly cried out.<br>At the same time, he also reined in that terrifying oppressive might of his.<br>He had turned a blind eye to Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s miserable plight before, but all of a sudden, he was showing so much concern for her.<br>This left Long Mumu and her mother in a state of bewilderment. However, when they took a closer look at Long Xiaoxiao, they froze in place.<br>They immediately understood what was going on.<br>There were some changes that were happening to Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s body. Her howl of agony was not because of Long Mumu striking her, but the changes she was undergoing.<br>One just had to pay closer attention in order to sense the mystical aura that was arising in Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s body. It was an energy very similar to that of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s bloodline, but it was many times stronger than that.<br>However, what stood out the most were the two things rising out of Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s head&mdash;horns.<br>This pair of horns was actually connected to her soul, and the powerful aura was coming from these horns.<br>Furthermore, the horns were still growing. Soon, they started to branch out like a tree.<br>Even though they still weren&rsquo;t too big yet, it was clear that they were growing more and more in resemblance to something.<br>Dragon horns!<br></p></div>
