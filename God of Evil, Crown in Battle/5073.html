        <h1>Chapter 5072</h1>
        <div>: Yaoyao Has a Way Out<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What use do I have for you to stay in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect for the rest of your life? Are you saying that our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect can&rsquo;t survive without you? Scram! I won&rsquo;t help you. Not only so, but I also won&rsquo;t allow anyone from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to help you.&rdquo;<br>The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster flung her sleeves and left the area.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, hurry up and get up.&rdquo;<br>Duan Liufeng rushed forward to support Chu Feng to his feet. He felt sympathetic for Chu Feng because he didn&rsquo;t think that the latter had done anything wrong. He could imagine just how stressed Chu Feng must be feeling right now.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to persuade the sectmaster for you.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Duan Liufeng rose into the air with the intention to chase the sectmaster, but before he left, he shot a glance at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Wait here for me. Don&rsquo;t leave this place till I return,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said.<br>He was worried that Chu Feng would return to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan all alone. Such an act would have been no different from committing suicide.<br>Chu Feng heeded Duan Liufeng&rsquo;s order and stood still on the spot. He was upset and helpless, but most of all, he felt a strong hatred. It wasn&rsquo;t directed at the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster but himself. He blamed his own powerlessness.<br>If only he was strong enough, he would have been able to master his master and friends.<br>&ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo; an adorable voice suddenly echoed in the empty hall.<br>Chu Feng glanced over, and a faint smile formed on his lips despite all of the negative emotions bubbling inside him. It was Yaoyao.<br>She had entered the hall at some point in time and was currently hiding behind a pillar, peeking at Chu Feng from afar. She wasn&rsquo;t as boisterous as she usually was, seemingly in a low mood. She was feeling sorry for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Yaoyao, when did you come in? I didn&rsquo;t notice you,&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Grandma Sectmaster gave me a treasure to conceal my aura. That&rsquo;s why you couldn&rsquo;t find me.&rdquo;<br>Yaoyao shook her wrist, revealing a silver bangle. It was a world spiritist treasure.<br>&ldquo;Come, let daddy hug you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng opened his arms wide and beckoned Yaoyao over.<br>Yaoyao finally revealed a sweet smile and leaped straight into Chu Feng&rsquo;s arms.<br>&ldquo;How have you been? Are you getting used to this place?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked concernedly.<br>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;<br>Yaoyao shook her head.<br>&ldquo;Oh? Do the people here not treat you as well as big sister Lele and the others?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Yaoyao shook her head yet again.<br>&ldquo;Actually, I didn&rsquo;t want to stay with big sister Lele and grandma. I want to be with daddy,&rdquo; Yaoyao replied.<br>&ldquo;Silly lass. There are things I have to do, so I can&rsquo;t bring you with me. Stay here obediently, alright? I&rsquo;ll visit you often,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Alright~&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing that Chu Feng would visit her often, her downcast face immediately lit up with a brilliant smile. Just like any innocent child, her mood changed very quickly.<br>She looked at Chu Feng with her blinking large eyes.<br>&ldquo;Daddy, did big sister Lele and grandma meet with baddies?&rdquo; Yaoyao asked.<br>Clearly, she had overheard Chu Feng&rsquo;s earlier conversation with the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster. Chu Feng smiled at her, not wanting to share the distressful news with her.<br>However, before he could say a word, Yaoayo suddenly said, &ldquo;Daddy, bring me with you. I can help you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Yaoyao is still a child. What you have to do is to grow up healthy and strong,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Daddy, don&rsquo;t look down on me. Have you forgotten where you have found me?&rdquo; Yaoyao harrumphed.<br>&ldquo;Yaoyao, you still remember that?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied in surprise.<br>It was bewildering as Yaoyao shouldn&rsquo;t have had memories of that. She wasn&rsquo;t even born then.<br>&ldquo;I remember things before meeting daddy too. Daddy, there&rsquo;s no need to be afraid. The Asura World Spirit Army can deal with those baddies, and I can control the Asura World Spirit Army!&rdquo; Yaoyao said with a gleeful smile as she swung her little clenched fists.<br>&ldquo;Yaoyao, Is what you&rsquo;re saying true?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was astonished to hear those words. There was no way he would forget where Yaoyao was from.<br>Back then, the Wretched Black Demon had asked Chu Feng for a favor, requesting that he disguised himself as an Asura Evil Spirit, sneak into the Asura Graveyard, and steal an item. The Asura Graveyard was a place where innumerable powerful evil spirits were imprisoned.<br>These Asura Evil Spirits called themselves the Asura World Spirit Army, and they were under the command of the powerful Asura King.<br>Upon sneaking into the Asura Graveyard, Chu Feng received help from an Asura Evil Spirit named Lord Yunliang and successfully stole the item. The item was none other than Yaoyao.<br>The Asura Evil Spirits seemed to put great importance on the unborn Yaoyao, but Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t certain of the reason why. He simply thought that Yaoyao was just a powerful demonic being. He had tried asking the Wretched Black Demon why he wanted to steal this item, but the latter didn&rsquo;t answer his question. Instead, he tried to eliminate Chu Feng.<br>Fortunately, Chu Feng was prepared for it and successfully escaped from the area. Following that, he took Wang Yuxian back to the Dao Sea.<br>It was also around then that the item gave birth to Yaoyao.<br>From the start to the end, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t able to figure out the secret of the Asura Evil Spirits. Yet, Yaoyao actually said that she possessed memories of her time in the Asura Graveyard, which meant that there was a good chance that she knew of their secret.<br>Most important of all, Yaoyao mentioned that she was able to control those Asura Evil Spirits!<br>Chu Feng had met those Asura Evil Spirits in person, and most of them were at<br>Martial Exalted level. Those who were of higher standing were even more unfathomably powerful, especially the Asura King. The pressure he felt from the Asura King was on a completely different level from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s Jiang Taibai.<br>Back then, Chu Feng thought that the Nine Souls Galaxy would be doomed if those Asura Evil Spirits escaped from the Asura Graveyard, but now that he thought about it&hellip;<br>If Yaoyao could command those Asura Evil Spirits, they would be able to resolve the current crisis of the Nine Souls Galaxy too!<br>Shoosh!<br>Chu Feng immediately left the hall together with Yaoyao in his arms. He was afraid that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster wouldn&rsquo;t allow him to leave with Yaoyao once she learned of the matter, so he decided to make a move right away.<br>Once he was finally a safe distance away, he set up multiple layers of formations before finally turning his attention to Yaoyao once more.<br></p></div>
