        <div> - Two People<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Good-for-nothings? Who are you calling good-for-nothings? Are you calling us good-for-nothings?!&rdquo;<br>The four world spiritists all looked at Chu Feng. Their eyes were filled with anger and hostility.<br>They seemed to be warning Chu Feng that he&rsquo;d best think before he spoke, or else they&rsquo;d teach him a lesson.<br>To their surprise, even though their threats were obvious, Chu Feng completely ignored it. With a calm look on his face, he said, &ldquo;Is there even a need to ask? Apart from the four of you, who else resembles good-for-nothings here?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze was focused on the four world spiritists as he said those words.<br>Not only that, but his gaze was also filled with contempt.<br>It was as if Chu Feng was afraid that the four of them wouldn&rsquo;t know what he was saying.<br>&ldquo;You little trash from the Ancestral Martial Starfield dare insult us?! You&rsquo;re truly courting death!&rdquo;<br>The four world spiritists were so furious that their expressions had changed enormously.<br>They were able to tolerate insults if it came from the four powers&rsquo; leaders. After all, they had indeed failed four times in a row, and had let down the leaders of those four powers.<br>However, they were truly unable to tolerate such behavior from a brat from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>As such, they were intended to attack Chu Feng.<br>However, they were soon stunned. Not only were they stunned, but the leaders of the four powers and their clansmen were also stunned.<br>They had suddenly felt an enormous killing intent.<br>That killing intent was bone-chillingly cold, and extremely oppressive.<br>It was as if, as if the owner of that killing intent wished it they would be annihilated in the next instant.<br>Because of that, none of them dared to act impulsively.<br>After they confirmed who it was that had released the killing intent they became even more surprised.<br>The reason for that was because the person who had unleashed the killing intent was Long Daozhi.<br>Before Chu Feng's appearance, they would&rsquo;ve never imagined that the Long Daozhi from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, someone that they all looked down on, would be able to release such killing intent.<br>&ldquo;I can ignore the bullshit you all said earlier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if you all dare to disrespect young friend Chu Feng again, I will have your lives,&rdquo; Long Daozhi narrowed his brows and spoke with a cold voice.<br>Seeing Long Daozhi acting in such a manner, they wanted to laugh, and even wanted to teach him a proper lesson.<br>After all, in their eyes Long Daozhi was nothing more than a clown.<br>A clown dared to speak to them in such a manner?<br>However, after sensing Long Daozhi&rsquo;s enormous killing intent, they started hesitating.<br>&ldquo;City Master Long, there&rsquo;s no need to bother with this bunch of clowns. If they dare to spout nonsense again just kill them,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;You bas&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Those people were flabbergasted upon hearing those words.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words were simply too arrogant.<br>Kill them?<br>Who did he think they were?<br>Did he really think they were trash?<br>This caused them to feel extremely displeased. However, they were afraid to say anything.<br>Even though they were unable to sense Long Daozhi&rsquo;s cultivation, his killing intent was enough to cause them fear, and make them act blindly without thinking.<br>Seeing that everyone had shut their mouths, Chu Feng did not bother to say anything.<br>He turned his gaze to Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, let&rsquo;s join hands,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu immediately accepted Chu Feng&rsquo;s request and arrived beside him.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re actually planning to cooperate with him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not breaching that spirit formation at all. You&rsquo;re simply trying to destroy this final chance instead,&rdquo; mocked the four world spiritists.<br>&ldquo;If you all dare attempt to breach this spirit formation, I will kill you.&rdquo;<br>Four bursts of rank five Utmost Exalted-level oppressive might were released. They enveloped Chu Feng and Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>They were from the four leaders.<br>&ldquo;If you four dare touch them, watch and see if I don&rsquo;t kill you first!&rdquo; Long Daozhi&rsquo;s voice exploded.<br>Accompanying his voice was his killing intent.<br>Long Daozhi&rsquo;s killing intent was even more terrifying than before.<br>He still hadn&rsquo;t released his oppressive might. He was still threatening them using only his killing intent.<br>However, it just so happened that his killing intent had managed to scare the four leaders again.<br>&ldquo;Long Daozhi, what is the meaning of this? Are you trying to protect them?&rdquo; asked the four leaders.<br>&ldquo;Allow them to attempt to breach the spirit formation. If anything happens I&rsquo;ll shoulder all the responsibility,&rdquo; said Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Long Daozhi, if they fail to breach the spirit formation, we will settle this matter with you,&rdquo; the four leaders said fiercely.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Long Daozhi agreed.<br>&ldquo;How about this instead? I won&rsquo;t do anything. Let&rsquo;s have them attempt to breach the spirit formation instead.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If the four of them are capable of breaching the spirit formation, they can do it instead,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to the four world spiritists as he said those words.<br>&ldquo;Humph. This spirit formation needs at least five people&rsquo;s cooperation. How could four people possibly breach it?&rdquo; said those four world spiritists.<br>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re afraid are you? If you&rsquo;re afraid then stand aside and shut up.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Watch carefully how we breach this spirit formation with two people.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words he looked to the four leaders.<br>&ldquo;Earlier you all said that you&rsquo;ll teach senior Long a lesson if we fail to breach this spirit formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we do manage to breach the spirit formation, what are you all going to do then?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;We&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words caused the four leaders to become speechless.<br>They had originally looked down on Chu Feng.<br>However, after seeing how confident he was they actually became worried.<br>&lsquo;What if this brat is really capable of breaching the spirit formation?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;We absolutely cannot gamble with him. Even if we are to bet against him, we cannot bet anything major. Else, if he really manages to breach the spirit formation we&rsquo;ll end up suffering a major loss.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say something? You all are the ones that found those four good-for-nothings and wasted all the precious opportunities and time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet now you&rsquo;re trying to push the fault for the failure onto our heads.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you give a statement about how you&rsquo;re going to deal with this matter?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that they&rsquo;d turned quiet, Chu Feng continued to press them.<br>&ldquo;We clearly ended up wasting four opportunities because that Liangqiu is too weak.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could you be blaming us now?&rdquo; refuted the four world spiritists.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu wasted the opportunities? Do you all have any proof of that?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;We four serve as proof,&rdquo; said the four world spiritists.<br>Chu Feng suddenly laughed. After laughing, he looked to the four leaders and said, &ldquo;Say, are the words spoken by those four sufficient as proof?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You all should know as to whether what they&rsquo;ve said is actual proof or venomous slander, no?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the four leaders and the four world spiritists all wanted to refute Chu Feng.<br>However, before they could say anything, Chu Feng continued, &ldquo;Firstly, you all believed that it was because of Grandmaster Liangqiu that you were unable to breach the spirit formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Secondly, you all say that this spirit formation needs at least five people to breach it, that it would be absolutely impossible for two people to breach it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, right now I am going to breach it with Grandmaster Liangqiu.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we fail to breach it, I, Chu Feng, am willing to offer my head as payment&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you absolutely must not.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could you assume responsibility for this?&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi and Grandmaster Liangqiu began panicking upon hearing those words. They immediately spoke to dissuade him.<br>After all, the attempt to breach the spirit formation had failed four times already. They all knew that the spirit formation would be very difficult to breach.<br>As such, they did not wish for Chu Feng to shoulder such a risk.<br>However, to their surprise Chu Feng stopped Long Daozhi and Grandmaster Liangqiu and indicated to them to stop with the dissuasions.<br>Then, he looked to the four world spiritists, &ldquo;If we are to succeed, it would mean that you four were making false accusations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo; That the incompetent person wasn't Grandmaster Liangqiu. Instead, it was the four of you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need you all to pay with your lives. However, I need you all to kneel before Grandmaster Liangqiu and kowtow to him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Then, you are to cut out your tongues,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What? Cut out our tongues?&rdquo; The four world spiritists were all surprised to hear those words.<br>They were capable of tolerating the act of kneeling and kowtowing to apologize for their mistake. But cutting out their tongues would be difficult for them to accept.<br>After all, that would be an act of extraordinary humiliation.<br></p></div>
