        <h1>Chapter 4611</h1>
        <div>: A Vicious Character<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Standing on Chu Feng&rsquo;s left was a man dressed humbly&mdash;Xia Yan.<br>On Chu Feng&rsquo;s right was an effeminate man dressed in a purple robe&mdash;Xiao Yu.<br>The two of them were the ones who had stepped into the Incubation Forest prior to Chu Feng, shortly after the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan entered the premises. It was due to this that Chu Feng recognized the two of them.<br>Back then, however, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t pay them much heed. He only thought that their courage was praiseworthy.<br>However, just by the fact that they were able to clear the trial like him, it only went to show that they weren&rsquo;t ordinary people. It would be unwise to underestimate their prowess.<br>&ldquo;Milord, did something go wrong? Are the three of them the ones who cleared the trial?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was confused. In their view, the three slots should have gone to the three prodigies of the Gongsun Clan. Even if a mishap occurred to them, the worst-case scenario should have been Yin Tianchou taking over one of their places.<br>However, the ones who had cleared the trial were instead people whom they had never met prior to this event before. Back then, they thought that these three people were small fries, and they would have never imagined that they could actually snatch the slots for the matchmaking convention from the three prodigies of the Gongsun Clan.<br>Weng!<br>While everyone was still making guesses on the matter, a radiant light suddenly cloaked the perimeter of the Incubation Forest.<br>Shoosh shoosh shoosh shoosh shoosh!<br>Silhouette after silhouette began appearing in the vicinity.<br>They were the ones who had entered the second trial but ended up getting eliminated.<br>Realizing what was going on, everyone immediately turned their sights over. If the three prodigies of the Gongsun Clan were there, it would mean that they had really been eliminated.<br>&ldquo;They were really eliminated?!&rdquo;<br>The crowd exclaimed in astonishment.<br>A familiar figure had just appeared right before their eyes. He was no other than Gongsun Qingyang, one of the three prodigies from the Gongsun Clan!<br>Gongsun Qingyang&rsquo;s complexion didn&rsquo;t look too good at the moment. He glanced at the three spirit formation gates ahead of him with a fuming look on his face before finally locking his eyes on the man known as Xia Yan.<br>On the other hand, Xia Yan also noticed Gongsun Qingyang&rsquo;s infuriated gaze, but he didn&rsquo;t appear fazed in the least. In fact, he even waved his hand at Gongsun Qingyang with a smile.<br>The exchange of gazes between the two told everyone that the two of them had clashed with one another in the Incubation Forest, and judging from the outcome, the victor was very likely to be Xia Yan.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Gongsun Tianhao! He&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Another uproar broke out amidst the crowd as yet another prodigies of the Gongsun Clan emerged from the light.<br>Gongsun Tianhao&rsquo;s clothes were a little tattered, but there were no external injuries on him at all. However, his pale lips and ghastly white face made it clear that he had suffered some kind of internal injury.<br>Gongsun Tianhao looked around for a bit before he caught sight of Xiao Yu. A sharp glint flashed across his eyes, and he bellowed, &ldquo;Tell me, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;<br>It was clear that Gongsun Tianhao&rsquo;s injuries were caused by Xiao Yu, or else the former wouldn&rsquo;t carry such great enmity toward the latter.<br>&ldquo;I am Xiao Yu.&rdquo;<br>It was clear that Xiao Yu was no pushover either. With a nonchalant face, he revealed his own name,<br>His calm reaction brought about shocked looks on the faces of the crowd. It was apparent that Gongsun Tianhao was intending to exact vengeance on him by asking for his name in such an occasion, and the fact that Xiao Yu still answered him so calmly showed that he carried no fear for the Gongsun Clan.<br>It was at this point that the crowd realized that it was not that the three prodigies of the Gongsun Clan didn&rsquo;t manage to find the spirit formation gates. Rather, they did find it, just that they were defeated by their competitors.<br>Since Gongsun Qingyang and Gongsun Tianhao were defeated by Xia Yan and Xiao Yu respectively, it would mean that Gongsun Leiyu was defeated by the man standing at the middle spirit formation gate.<br>So, the crowd waited in anticipation to see how Gongsun Leiyu would react once he was transported out as well. Their patience soon paid off, as Gongsun Leiyu&rsquo;s figure appeared before everyone&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>It was just that Gongsun Leiyu&rsquo;s appearances brought about gasps of shock from the crowd. Everyone was at a loss for words.<br>Compared to Gongsun Qingyang and Gongsun Tianhao, Gongsun Leiyu suffered a fate much worse.<br>It was almost stretching it a little to call him a human; he looked more like a heap of meat at this point. His condition was so bad that some of the faint-hearted began puking on the spot. If not for his clothes, the crowd wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to recognize him at all.<br>&ldquo;Leiyu! Leiyu!!!&rdquo;<br>Gongsun Qingyang and Gongsun Tianhao immediately rushed forward and fed him a pill so as to stabilize his condition. After that, they turned to the elders standing around to seek their help.<br>Perhaps due to Gongsun Leiyu&rsquo;s background, the elders didn&rsquo;t turn a blind eye to his plight. They quickly rushed forward to treat him.<br>It was fortunate that Gongsun Leiyu&rsquo;s injuries weren&rsquo;t fatal despite the awful situation he was in, so it looked like he was going to survive the ordeal. This made everyone heave a sigh of relief.<br>Even so, Gongsun Qingyang and Gongsun Tianhao had no intentions of letting this matter go this easily.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll slaughter you!!!&rdquo;<br>The two of them shot vicious glares at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Hey hey hey, don&rsquo;t frame me for something I didn&rsquo;t do. His current state has nothing to do with me at all,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of getting into trouble, but that didn&rsquo;t mean that he would allow others to frame him that easily. After all, why should he admit to things that he didn&rsquo;t do?<br>&ldquo;You coward! You did such a thing, yet you don&rsquo;t dare to admit to it?&rdquo;<br>The infuriated Gongsun Qingyang and Gongsun Tianhao drew their blades as they began walking toward Chu Feng angrily. They were determined to exact vengeance for Gongsun Leiyu.<br>&ldquo;Hold it right there!!!&rdquo;<br>Before they could come close to Chu Feng, an authoritative voice reverberated in the air.<br>Following that, two old men descended from the sky.<br>Upon seeing these two old men, all of the juniors and elders quickly lowered their heads to pay respects to them.<br>One of the two old men was a familiar face to Chu Feng. He was the elder whom Chu Feng saw in the vicinity of the Asura Graveyard, Dongfang Yunkong.<br>The other old man had white hair and was rather skinny. He was dressed in a world spiritist robe, and he had an amicable face. He was known as Zhou Huofeng.<br>&ldquo;Since you have chosen to participate in the trials on your volition, you should at least be prepared to lose your life. Are you certain that you wish to continue embarrassing the Gongsun Clan here?&rdquo;<br>Zhou Huofeng shot a sharp glance at Gongsun QIngyang and Gongsun Tianhao.<br>Those two prodigies were burning with rage, but they chose to rein their anger in for the time being. They sheathed their weapons and stepped back.<br>After all that had happened, the disdain and skepticism the crowd had directed toward the trio standing before the spirit formation gates earlier had been replaced with deference. This was especially so for Chu Feng.<br>A person who dared to reduce Gongsun Leiyu to such a state was bound to be a vicious character.<br></p></div>
