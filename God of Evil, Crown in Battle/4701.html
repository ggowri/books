        <h1>Chapter 4700</h1>
        <div>: Brothers<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Elder Duan, you&rsquo;re willing to become my master?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was taken aback by Elder Duan&rsquo;s sudden change of mind.<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re only acknowledging me as your master in order to thank me, there&rsquo;s no way I would agree to it. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to hinder you over my own interests. However, if you&rsquo;re a troublemaker and need someone to clean up your mess&hellip; Well, from this day onward, you can tell them that your master is I, Duan Liufeng! If you got into any trouble, tell them to settle the scores with me instead!&rdquo; Duan Liufeng declared proudly with a thump of his chest.<br>He looked like he was determined to back Chu Feng up here even though he didn&rsquo;t have the strength to do so. However, it was this exactly that made Chu Feng even more moved by his remarks.<br>Initially, Chu Feng had only wanted to become Duan Liufeng&rsquo;s disciple in order to repay him so that he could join the North Tortoise Hall. But now, he was filled with awe toward Duan Liufeng.<br>&ldquo;Disciple Chu Feng pays respects to master.&rdquo; Chu Feng bowed down to perform the acknowledgment ceremony.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, if anyone else wants to take you in as their disciple but you don&rsquo;t want to accept it, you can tell them that I, Duan Liufeng, am already your master. If you meet someone whom your respect and wish to learn from him, go ahead and do so. You need not worry about my views.<br>&ldquo;However, you mustn&rsquo;t acknowledge me as your master. Instead of becoming your master, I would very much prefer to be your brother instead,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said.<br>&ldquo;Elder Duan, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked at Duan Liufeng with a complicated look in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to get into trouble, go ahead to do so. I&rsquo;m not worried about being implicated by your deeds,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;In the end, you still don&rsquo;t wish to take me in as your disciple,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I have the ability to become another person&rsquo;s master. Chu Feng, I admire you a lot, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m worthy of becoming your master. To outsiders, you are more than welcome to address me as your master, but in private, I hope that we can remain as brothers. What do you think about it?&rdquo; Duan Liufeng asked.<br>Chu Feng had already figured out Duan Liufeng&rsquo;s intention by now.<br>Duan Liufeng had agreed to become his master, but he intended for it to be just for show. He just wanted to become a shield to stop the other elders from pestering him.<br>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t need Duan Liufeng to become a shield for him. That was not his style of handling things.<br>Chu Feng wanted to take Duan Liufeng as his master so as to help him enter the North Tortoise Hall and compensate him. However, since Duan Liufeng wasn&rsquo;t interested in such stuff, there was no point forcing it on him.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, it looks like we are more fated to be brothers then,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;It looks like you don&rsquo;t need my help at all. But again&hellip; I doubt that I&rsquo;ll be of any help to you in my current state either. Very well, let&rsquo;s be brothers then. From now on, should I call you Brother Chu?&rdquo;<br>Duan Liufeng was quite a candid person, following through with what he said right away.<br>&ldquo;That means I should be calling you Brother Duan too, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Yes, of course! Hahaha, I can&rsquo;t be one-sidedly calling you Brother Chu, right?&rdquo; Duan Liufeng chuckled.<br>&ldquo;Brother Duan, since we&rsquo;re brothers now, I&rsquo;ll be frank with you. I&rsquo;ve heard from Duan Qinian that your cultivation regressed due to your injuries. I happen to be skilled in world spiritist techniques, so can you allow me to diagnose your condition?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He knew that Duan Liufeng&rsquo;s condition was likely to be far more severe than he imagined, but he still wanted to give it a try anyway. Even if it was unlikely to work out, he still wanted to give it a try.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect Brother Chu to be proficient in world spiritist techniques too. Since you wish to give it a try, feel free to do what you need to then. Come, let&rsquo;s enter the residence first.&rdquo;<br>Duan Liufeng gestured Chu Feng into the residence before the latter began diagnosing his condition.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, you&rsquo;re actually a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak world spiritist?&rdquo;<br>When Chu Feng showcased his world spiritist technique, Duan Liufeng&rsquo;seyes widened in astonishment. Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was already at Utmost Exalted level, and the fact that his world spiritist techniques had reached the level of Dragon Mark Saint-cloak meant that he was an all-rounded prodigy.<br>Duan Liufeng already had very high expectations for Chu Feng, but the latter still continued to exceed them. Naturally, he was delighted to see that.<br>On the other hand, Chu Feng simply smiled quietly before channeling his spirit power into Duan Liufeng&rsquo;s body. He carefully examined every nook and cranny, and everything was in order except for the latter&rsquo;s dantian.<br>So, he began to inspect the dantian more closely. To his astonishment, there was actually a malevolent presence in there.<br>It was a dense congregation of purple aura that emanated a terrifying aura. Even at a single glance, Chu Feng could tell that it was something extremely dangerous.<br>It was this purple aura that had conquered Duan Liufeng&rsquo;s dantian and sealed off his cultivation, resulting in the regression of his strength. If they could exterminate this purple aura, there was a good chance that Duan Liufeng would be able to cultivate normally like anyone else.<br>The only problem was that the purple aura was simply too powerful. Chu Feng&rsquo;s current level of world spiritist technique was far from sufficient to drive it away, He couldn&rsquo;t even tell how powerful a world spiritist had to be in order to curb the purple aura.<br>&ldquo;Brother Duan, what trial did you go through back then? Why is there such a powerful malevolent presence in your dantian?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, I chose to become your brother because of your upright character. It has only been a day since we met one another, but I have great trust in you. However, I think it&rsquo;s better for you not to know of this matter,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said.<br>&ldquo;I understand. Brother Duan, your condition is treatable, but I&rsquo;m afraid that I&rsquo;m lacking in strength to do so at the moment. If I ever develop my spirit power to a level where I can treat you, I&rsquo;ll definitely drive off the malevolent presence in your dantian so that you can become a proper cultivator once more!&rdquo; Chu Feng promised.<br>&ldquo;Good, as expected of my brother! I&rsquo;ll be waiting for that day to come then. For now, let&rsquo;s head to the North Tortoise Hall.&rdquo;<br>As Duan Liufeng said those words, he began packing up his stuff.<br>&ldquo;Brother Duan, if we&rsquo;re going to be brothers instead, I don&rsquo;t wish to lie about this matter and claim that you&rsquo;re my master,&rdquo; Chu Feng said awkwardly.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha, Brother Chu. Elder Qi has already told me that even if I don&rsquo;t accept you as my disciple, I&rsquo;d still be able to enter the North Tortoise Hall. Right now, I&rsquo;m already an elder of the North Tortoise Hall,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng explained.<br>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Chu Feng was taken aback.<br>He was busy familiarizing himself with the North Tortoise Hall earlier, so he wasn&rsquo;t present during the distribution of bestowments earlier. As such, he wasn&rsquo;t aware that Duan Liufeng had already officially become an elder of the North Tortoise Hall.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. An elder of the North Tortoise Hall told me about it when I was collecting my bestowment.&rdquo;<br>Duan Liufeng took out a token and showed it to Chu Feng. It was the elder token of the North Tortoise Hall.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was delighted to hear this, and his impression of Dao Qinian improved as well.<br>Once Duan Liufeng was done packing up, the two of them quickly made their way toward the North Tortoise Hall. The elders and disciples had separate quarters, so after helping Duan Liufeng to settle down, Chu Feng made his way back to his residence.<br>To his astonishment, he found himself faced with a massive crowd that jammed up the way to his residence.<br></p></div>
