        <h1>Chapter 3883</h1>
        <div> - The Dusky Palace Hall<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the person lying on the ground, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed.<br>Tuoba Chengan and others were all carefully observing that person.<br>They wanted to know exactly what sort of person someone who dared to make an enemy of them was like.<br>However, as light was revolving around the body of the person lying on the ground, they were simply unable to see his appearance.<br>Soon, many elders from the All-heaven Sect shouted furiously, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s him! Lord Supreme Elder, this is the guy who stole our treasures!&rdquo;<br>Through their words. Tuoba Chengan confirmed his guess. Sure enough, this was one of their enemies.<br>&ldquo;Who are you?! What is your relationship with that Asura?!&rdquo; asked Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;Humph. This Exalted is Young Master Asura&rsquo;s subordinate, one of the Eighteen Saintly Exalted,&rdquo; said the person lying on the ground.<br>Even though he had a very sorry appearance, his voice was extremely tough and overbearing.<br>It was as if he was a ruler of the world.<br>&ldquo;Eighteen Saintly Exalted?&rdquo;<br>The expressions of the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s elders grew tense upon hearing that title.<br>Then, they looked at each other in dismay. Deep unease appeared in their eyes.<br>What were they afraid of?<br>What they were most afraid of was that Asura being supported by powerful experts.<br>After hearing what that person said, they realized that the situation was rather bad.<br>&ldquo;You dare touch this Exalted? It seems that you don't know how powerful this Exalted is!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the person that was originally lying on the ground suddenly stood up.<br>After standing up, his body began to float upward.<br>At the same time, the light that was revolving around him grew brighter. That light was actually able to affect his surroundings.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the mountains started to crumble, and the earth started to shatter. Even space itself was shaking violently. Facing that immense power, even Tuoba Chengan started frowning.<br>He was able to tell that their opponent possessed enormous power.<br>Not even he was certain he would be able to defeat him.<br>Most importantly, his opponent&rsquo;s power was extremely strange. It was not martial power, nor was it purely world spirit power. However, it was still extremely powerful, and gave off a very sacred sensation.<br>It seemed like a power that was capable of ruling over everything and altering fate.<br>Seeing that power, one would feel reverence toward it, and not dare blaspheme it.<br>&ldquo;Wuuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, all of a sudden, that person who had floated into the sky let out a scream. Then, like a broken kite, he lost the ability to fly and fell straight down, crashing firmly into the ground.<br>The crowd were all confused to see this scene.<br>That fellow was clearly extremely powerful and planning to take care of them earlier. Why would he suddenly fall so miserably to the ground?<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>At the moment when everyone was confused, many blood-colored pillars appeared out of thin air. Like sharp swords, the pillars shot down from the sky and pierced through that man&rsquo;s body in succession, pinning him to the ground.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahh~~~&rdquo;<br>With his body pierced, that man with light revolving around his body started to scream in miserable pain.<br>At that moment, the crowd were finally able to tell who it was that had done all this.<br>It was the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had appeared at the spirit formation entrance.<br>He had used the power of his treasures to easily restrict that fellow with the sacred light revolving around him.<br>Seeing that, the crowd all felt great admiration.<br>The power emitted by that man earlier had been so very powerful.<br>It had brought unease to even Tuoba Chengan.<br>Yet, he had been so easily subdued by the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>At that moment, they seemed to finally realize why someone as conceited as Grandmaster Huang would show such esteem for Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was simply too powerful; terrifyingly powerful.<br>He simply resembled a freak, a monster.<br>&ldquo;Bastard! You dare injure this Exalted?! My brothers will definitely not spare you!&rdquo; that person pinned down by the blood-red pillars shouted angrily.<br>&ldquo;This Exalted?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mystic Cave Saints, don&rsquo;t try to mystify things before this Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With your mere bit of ability, you dare address yourself as Exalted?&rdquo; mocked the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Mystic Cave Saints?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all stunned upon hearing those words.<br>The people from the All-heaven Sect had all heard of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>Could it be that the person lying on the ground, the person that had robbed them of their treasures, was one of the Mystic Cave Saints?<br>But, that shouldn&rsquo;t be the case. The Mystic Cave Saints shouldn&rsquo;t be that powerful.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a horsetail whisk appeared in that Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s hand.<br>That horsetail whisk was extremely strange. It was actually blood-colored.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted suddenly waved the horsetail whisk.<br>Immediately, a blood-red gale was sent forth toward the man with light revolving around him.<br>&ldquo;Eeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>Being hit by the blood-red gale, that man&rsquo;s voice grew even more miserable.<br>After the blood-red gale swept past him, the crowd were able to see that the light revolving around his body had disappeared.<br>At this moment, a person wearing a gown was lying on the ground.<br>His outfit was precisely that of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>This person was the Seventh of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually the Mystic Cave Saints!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What audacity! You bunch dare to plunder the treasures of our All-heaven Sect?! Have you grown tired of living?!&rdquo;<br>Upon realizing that they had indeed been robbed by the Mystic Cave Saints, the fear that the people from the All-heaven Sect felt immediately disappeared into thin air, and was replaced with endless anger.<br>After all, in their eyes, even though the Mystic Cave Saints were rather capable, they were nothing more than a bunch of low-tier scoundrels.<br>They believed the Mystic Cave Saints to be far inferior to Grandmaster Huang and that Grandmaster Ouyang who had fled earlier. Naturally, they would not attach any importance to them.<br>However, upon thinking that they were actually toyed around with by the Mystic Cave Saints earlier, the anger in their hearts naturally increased manifold.<br>At that moment, their eyes had turned blood-red, and their killing intent was surging everywhere.<br>They were itching to tear all the Mystic Cave Saints to pieces.<br>Even if they were to skin them alive, pull out their tendons and drink their blood, they would not be able to appease their anger.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in such a rush to take care of him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still ten more of these little rats.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would not be too late for you all to take care of them once this Exalted captures all of them.&rdquo;<br>After the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted said those words, he turned around and entered the spirit formation entrance again.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>Seeing the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s confident look as he entered the spirit formation entrance, the Seventh of the Mystic Cave Saints disregarded his own injuries and pain. Worry filled his eyes.<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was simply too terrifying.<br>He had clearly already obtained the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s acknowledgement, and gained great power both inside and outside the tomb.<br>Yet, he was completely powerless to retaliate against the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>This made him worry greatly for his brothers. He was afraid his brothers would all be captured by the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>The Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb was extremely mysterious.<br>Even though the Mystic Cave Saints had obtained the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s acknowledge and gained special powers, there were still many places that they could not reach.<br>In fact, there were places that even the mysterious and extremely powerful Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted could not reach.<br>One such example would be a dusky palace hall.<br></p></div>
