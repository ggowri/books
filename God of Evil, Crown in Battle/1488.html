        <div> - I&rsquo;ll Go With You<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng is still as confident as ever,&rdquo; Suddenly, a laugh was heard. Without any prior notice, Hong Qiang appeared beside Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior Hong Qiang is still someone who will come and go without a trace. Every single time, you shock me,&rdquo; Su Mei said with a sweet smile. Her impression of Hong Qiang was pretty good. That was because she knew that Hong Qiang had been very good to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Girl, you are no ordinary person either. A talented man and a beautiful woman, the two of you are quite a match,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Senior Hong Qiang, truth be told, Lil Mei is my fianc&eacute;e,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Hearing what Chu Feng said, Su Mei was startled. She did not expect that Chu Feng would announce their relationship to Hong Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Lil Mei, it&rsquo;s alright, senior Hong Qiang is someone I trust,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Understood, so this is a secret? Rest assured, this old man&rsquo;s lips are sealed,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said with a beaming smile.<br>Hearing what Hong Qiang said, Su Mei&rsquo;s little face instantly turned red. She looked to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, it seems that senior Hong Qiang has come for you with an important matter. I will not bother you two. I&rsquo;ll go and find the others.&rdquo;<br>After she finished saying those words, Su Mei ran toward the direction that Sima Ying and the others had left in.<br>&ldquo;That girl is very good. Boy, your luck with women is quite good,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Senior Hong Qiang, you&rsquo;ve succeeded?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; Hong Qiang asked.<br>&ldquo;With how happy you are, it is easy to guess,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Enough of that. No one is as sharp as you are boy, your perception is truly keen,&rdquo; Hong Qiang gave Chu Feng a side-eye. Then, he took a Cosmos Sack from his bosom and handed it to Chu Feng. &ldquo;Finally, I&rsquo;ve accomplished my mission.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thank you, senior Hong Qiang.&rdquo; After Chu Feng received the Cosmos Sack, an expression of excitement filled his face. He knew that the lotus seed was in the Cosmos Sack. Furthermore, there was no longer a seal on the lotus seed.<br>&ldquo;Although I do not know why you need this, I have, nevertheless, finally succeeded in my task,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;Senior Hong Qiang, now that the Nine Powers Hunt is over, do you plan to return to the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not returning. There is no longer anything that I am concerned with there,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, what about the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest? After all, you are the headmaster of that place,&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve chosen my successor already. You shall be the headmaster of the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;For real? Me?&rdquo; Chu Feng was deeply shocked.<br>&ldquo;Haha, I&rsquo;m merely joking. I know that a place as small as the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest would not be able to contain you. Thus, when I left, I had already made preparations. I had chosen two suitable candidates to take on my headmaster position as well as your Colorful Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s head position.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if you ever felt the need to return there, they would definitely not dare to stop you,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;Senior Hong Qiang is truly thoughtful,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled. If Hong Qiang was not going to be the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s headmaster anymore, there would be no reason for him to be involved with the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest either.<br>However, there was still that crystal coffin, as well as the mysterious corpse within that coffin there. Although Chu Feng did not know who it was, he had a feeling that he would eventually return there for it.<br>&ldquo;In that case, Chu Feng, what are your plans? Do you plan to continue to stay in the Cyanwood Mountain?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are now the treasure of the Cyanwood Mountain. No one would dare to bully you again,&rdquo; Hong Qiang asked.<br>&ldquo;No, after a couple days, I will be leaving this place. I have a matter that I must go to the Cursed Soil Domain for,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;The Cursed Soil Domain? In the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Remnants, you forced all twenty of the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s disciples to forfeit. With their temperament, they will definitely harbor hard feelings toward you. If you are to go to the Cursed Soil Domain now, the Cursed Soil Sect will definitely not let you off should they find out about this,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;Junior knows this. However, I have a friend who was captured by the Cursed Soil Sect. I must go and rescue her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Hong Qiang&rsquo;s expression changed. After that, he surveyed their surroundings before grabbing onto Chu Feng and saying, &ldquo;The walls have ears, let&rsquo;s talk inside.&rdquo;<br>After entering Chu Feng&rsquo;s palace, Hong Qiang set up a soundproofing spirit formation. Then, he asked, &ldquo;Chu Feng, what did you say earlier? You&rsquo;re planning to charge into the Cursed Soil Sect to save someone? Who would be this important for you to put yourself in this sort of danger?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a friend. I knew this friend back in the Eastern Sea Region,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Sss~~~&rdquo; Hong Qiang sucked in a mouthful of air. He realized how important this friend was to Chu Feng. &ldquo;It would seem that you are insistent on saving her?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;You are truly one to emphasize camaraderie,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Friends should help one another even by sacrificing themselves. Not to mention that she&rsquo;s in the Cursed Soil Sect right now, even if she was in a sea of flames or a mountain of blades, I would still go and save her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;The Cursed Soil Sect is much more dangerous than a sea of flames or a mountain of blades. You must absolutely not go alone,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I know that you&rsquo;re worried about me. However, I must save her,&rdquo; Chu Feng grew a bit tense. If Hong Qiang were to refuse to allow him to go, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that he would have no way to save Tantai Xue?<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you&rsquo;re planning to go with me?&rdquo; Chu Feng was shocked to hear those words. Never had he ever expected Hong Qiang to say such a thing.<br>&ldquo;I must go. Not only me, others must go too,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;Others?&rdquo; Chu Feng was confused. Who were the others that Hong Qiang was speaking of?<br>&ldquo;The World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master and that Elder Miao Renlong, as well as your Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster Dugu Xingfeng must all go,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;Them? This is impossible. I am merely a disciple, how could I ask them to set out for me? Moreover, how could they be willing to do this sort of thing?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing impossible. Right now, you are extremely important to them. Your importance to them most definitely surpasses your imagination. Otherwise, Dugu Xingfeng would not protect you like he did today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the Cursed Soil Sect, to the Cyanwood Mountain and the World Spiritist Alliance, it is merely a neutral power on the surface. However, in reality, the Cursed Soil Sect is the most isolated power among the Nine Powers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, if you truly need their assistance, they will definitely help you. In fact, you really do need their assistance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because standing behind the Cursed Soil Sect is the Cursed Soil Sacred Assembly. The Cursed Soil Sacred Assembly is a place with the backing of Martial Emperors. If you were to alarm those old monsters, you would definitely die.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, we must achieve absolute safety in going there. If I alone am to go with you, I will not be able to accomplish that. However, if Dugu Xingfeng, the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong were to come with us, it would be much safer,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;But, how am I going to tell them about this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Just tell them as it is. I believe that they will help you,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;Junior understands now. Thank you senior for your advice,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Mn, in that case, I&rsquo;ll take my leave first. When it&rsquo;s time to go, inform me,&rdquo; Hong Qiang turned around and began to leave.<br>&ldquo;Senior, thank you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to be this courteous toward me. Who knows, maybe in the future I will end up needing your help,&rdquo; Hong Qiang smiled lightly. His body moved, and he instantly disappeared.<br>After Hong Qiang left, Chu Feng&rsquo;s train of thought became a bit complicated. Before, he had only been thinking about saving Tantai Xue by himself, and had never thought about asking for help from Dugu Xingfeng and the other grand characters.<br>However, upon thinking about it, he determined that what Hong Qiang said was correct and very reasonable. If he were to go by himself, he would have to be extremely careful. If there was the slightest mishap, he would undoubtedly be killed.<br>With Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength, there was no need for the old monsters of the Cursed Soil Sacred Assembly to act. In fact, there was not even the need for the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s headmaster to act. Merely among the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s elders, there were already many people capable of killing him.<br>However, if Dugu Xingfeng, the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master, Miao Renlong and Hong Qiang were to help him, this matter would be a lot more simple.<br>After all, the four of them were all headmaster-level characters. Each and every one of them were peak Half Martial Emperors, existences only a step away from reaching Martial Emperor.<br></p></div>
