        <div> - What Sort Of Character<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After deciding to wait, the crowd returned to their respective businesses.<br>Chu Feng continued to meticulously study that chess strategy.<br>Kong Ci, Xian Yun and the others were also meticulously studying chess strategies. Furthermore, they brought the other younger generations and began to set up formations with them to practice chess power.<br>It was only when the geniuses from the All-heaven Starfield arrived that Chu Feng and the others stopped what they were doing.<br>Chu Feng was finally able to meet those geniuses from the All-heaven Starfield.<br>The people that came from the All-heaven Starfield were all of the younger generation. Their number was not a lot, only a hundred and nine people.<br>This number was very close to the number of participants required for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess.<br>The participants for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess were a hundred and eight people per side.<br>Nangong Yifang would not easily join the chess match. Thus, he could be considered to be an extra.<br>The remaining hundred and eight people were just enough to enter the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess&rsquo;s chessboard.<br>Thus, they had truly come prepared, and did not even bring an extra person.<br>That said, it was worth mentioning that all of the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were very powerful.<br>Among them were five rank two Exalted and thirteen rank one Exalted. The remainder were all Martial Immortals. Twenty were peak Martial Immortals. Even the weakest amongst them were rank five Martial Immortals.<br>From this, it could be seen that the All-heaven Starfield had quite a lot of excellent younger generations.<br>At least, the number of geniuses present far surpassed that of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Even if the Ancestral Martial Decastars were placed there, they would most definitely appear much inferior.<br>This also made Chu Feng realize why the younger generations of the Three Cities would disregard all of the Ancestral Martial Decastars apart from Linghu Hongfei and himself.<br>After all, when comparing them, the geniuses from the Ancestral Martial Decastars were truly not up to par.<br>Even though there were a lot of geniuses from the All-heaven Starfield, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze was focused mainly on a single young man.<br>That young man wore a white gown, and had a headdress on his head. His low profile appearance resembled that of a scholar.<br>However, he gave off a very unparalleled air of insufferable arrogance. His gaze was filled with contempt. Regardless of whether it was the people of the younger generation, people of his fellow generation or even his seniors, his gaze was still filled with such contempt.<br>That person was the top genius of the All-heaven Starfield, the genius who had fought Linghu Hongfei countless times with results unknown, Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;Brother Nangong, can you spar with me, Wuming Yuanzhi, this time around?&rdquo; asked Wuming Yuanzhi.<br>However, Nangong Yifan not only did not respond to Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s request, but he did not even bother to look to him.<br>He was truly not placing Wuming Yuanzhi in his eyes.<br>It must be kept in mind that Wuming Yuanzhi was no ordinary individual. He was one of the top geniuses of the Starfield Master Realm.<br>His cultivation was also very powerful.<br>A genius like Wuming Yuanzhi would be conceited to begin with. Receiving such contempt, they would all be furious. This was even more so when the person Nangong Yifan was showing such contempt for was the short-tempered Wuming Yuanzhi.<br>&ldquo;Say, Nangong Yifan, are you a mute or what?&rdquo; Sure enough, Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s face immediately turned ugly, like it did when he had challenged Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Wuming Yuanzhi, you&rsquo;re unable to even defeat me, yet you want to challenge Nangong Yifan?&rdquo;<br>After Wuming Yuanzhi spoke, another scholarly-looking man stood out from the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s geniuses.<br>Although he was also dressed like a scholar, he was very different from Nangong Yifan. Although Nangong Yifan had an insufferably arrogant gaze, he looked very weak.<br>However, this man was different. He had a very robust and tall build, and a fierce face. From a glance, one could tell that he was not someone to be pushed around.<br>Most importantly, his cultivation was also rank two Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Beiyang Luo, are you stupid?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although we&rsquo;ve fought before, we&rsquo;ve always tied. You&rsquo;ve never won against me either. That&rsquo;s called being tied, okay? It&rsquo;s not that I, Wuming Yuanzhi, am no match for you,&rdquo; refuted Wuming Yuanzhi.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve also said to you before that I am no match for Nangong Yifan. Unless you can defeat me, you are unqualified to challenge Nangong Yifan,&rdquo; said the man named Beiyang Luo.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo; Wuming Yuanzhi gritted his teeth angrily. Then, he shouted loudly, &ldquo;Come! Fight me again!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s afraid of you, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; that Beiyang Luo showed no fear. As the two spoke, they both started walking away. They looked like they were truly going to fight.<br>&ldquo;Yuanzhi, that&rsquo;s enough. You&rsquo;ve fought brother Beiyang many times already without a victor being determined. Although both of you have improved and become rank two Exalted, I believe that you two will still not be able to determine an outcome should you fight again now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, the Divine Armament Cemetery is open now. We should be entering it without delay. Thus, stop causing a scene,&rdquo; said Wuming Xiongmo.<br>Contrary to how old they looked, Wuming Xiongmo was obviously much more mature than Wuming Yuanzhi.<br>Most important of all, it seemed like Wuming Yuanzhi was very obedient when it came to Wuming Xiongmo. After Wuming Xiongmo spoke, even though Wuming Yuanzhi still had a furious look on his face, he merely let out several light snorts before saying no more.<br>Then, led by Wuming Xiongmo, the younger generations of the Ancestral Martial Starfield began to chat with the younger generations of the All-heaven Starfield.<br>Although they appeared to be joyous and harmonious, Chu Feng was able to tell that the two sides had hidden hostility toward each other, and were merely putting up a disguise of friendliness.<br>Right at that moment, Lord Shoujian&rsquo;s voice sounded. &ldquo;If all young friends are ready, let us enter the Divine Armament Cemetery.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Shoujian, we are ready,&rdquo; the younger generations said in unison.<br>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; right at that moment, Nangong Yifan suddenly spoke. His expression looked very cold as he said that word.<br>Furthermore, his tone did not sound like a request. Rather, it sounded more like a command.<br>In short, after he said that word, the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield all felt very displeased.<br>After all, all of the people present were very respectful to Lord Shoujian. Even the younger generations from the All-heaven Starfield were very courteous. Nangong Yifan was the only exception.<br>His arrogance was something that even Chu Feng could not put up with.<br>However, compared to the displeasure of the others, Lord Shoujian did not voice any complaint. Instead, he asked amiably, &ldquo;Young friend Nangong, is there an issue?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have a friend coming,&rdquo; said Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;How long will it take for your friend to arrive?&rdquo; asked Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;Soon,&rdquo; said Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;Then we can all wait a moment,&rdquo; Lord Shoujian was truly very easy to speak to.<br>However, to the crowd&rsquo;s surprise, after Lord Shoujian agreed to it, Nangong Yifan not only did not utter a word of thanks, but he did not even say anything.<br>It was as if it was only natural for Lord Shoujian to agree to it.<br>This caused the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations great displeasure. However, right when someone wanted to cause trouble for Nangong Yifan, they were immediately stopped by Lord Shoujian.<br>With that, the crowd had no choice but to wait for that friend of Nangong Yifan with him.<br>That said, although Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s attitude was very displeasing, the crowd were also very curious.<br>They all wanted to know exactly who this friend was that could actually make him speak to ask Lord Shoujian to wait.<br>After all their encounters, the crowd had a slight understanding of Nangong Yifan. They knew that he was always very cold and detached.<br>His coldness was not only aimed at the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. He was equally cold toward the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>Thus, he should actually be someone without many friends. It wasn&rsquo;t that he was unable to make friends, but rather that he felt it beneath him to befriend others.<br>Thus, the crowd all suspected that Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s friend was definitely someone extraordinary.<br>Due to being overly curious as to who exactly this friend was, many people decided to directly run to the outside of the Divine Armament Villa to wait for that person.<br>Chu Feng originally didn&rsquo;t plan to bother with this. He had wanted to take the time to continue studying the chess strategy.<br>However, Kong Tianhui was extremely curious, and forcibly dragged him to the outside of the Divine Armament Villa.<br>At this moment, the crowd were all discussing spiritedly. Even the people from the All-heaven Starfield were discussing spiritedly.<br>They were discussing who exactly Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s friend was.<br>Only Chu Feng was quietly reading his chess strategy.<br>He had an attitude of not wallowing in the mire with the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Hey! Hey! Hey! Look, that guy is actually reading the most difficult chess strategy! Those people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield must&rsquo;ve gone mad thinking so hard about winning.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Win? It&rsquo;s impossible for them to win.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ignoring how difficult that chess strategy is, we have Nangong Yifan to lead us. WIth Nangong Yifan present, those people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield will forever be unable to win.&rdquo;<br>Whilst Chu Feng was meticulously studying the chess strategy, he could hear mocking voices from beside him. They were all from the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>Chu Feng ignored all of them. When not even the people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield believed in him, it was extremely normal for outsiders to ridicule him.<br>Chu Feng was never one to bother with things like that. He was instead fond of using fact to prove himself.<br>They could ridicule him all they wanted now...<br>Later on, when they truly entered the chessboard, Chu Feng would make it clear to them what sort of character he was.<br></p></div>
