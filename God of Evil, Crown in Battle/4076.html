        <h1>Chapter 4075</h1>
        <div> - The Prophesied Destiny<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside a Purple Star Hall palace. There was a strange grand formation.<br>A figure was standing before that grand formation.<br>This person was the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>He was staring at that grand formation, unable to take his eyes off it. It was as if he were waiting for something, afraid of missing something.<br>Suddenly, an old man walked in and reported, &ldquo;Milord, the Red-dress Holy Land has also withdrawn from the Purple Star Variance Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; The Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master nodded.<br>He did not intend to pay much attention to this matter. However, when he noticed that the old man was still standing there, he turned around and asked, &ldquo;Is there something else to report?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster encountered an extremely powerful Variance Beast and nearly lost her life,&rdquo; said that old man.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already informed them of the dangers ahead of time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not to mention being injured, even if they are to die in there, it would have nothing to do with us,&rdquo; said the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;But, Lord Hall Master, you were the one who demanded that they must all enter,&rdquo; said that old man.<br>&ldquo;What are you implying? Are you blaming me?&rdquo; the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master asked with a stern voice.<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, this subordinate wouldn&rsquo;t dare blame you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if Lord Hall Master is to directly kill those trash, this subordinate would not think that Lord Hall Master did anything wrong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re trash to begin with. They are the disgrace of our Holy Light Galaxy. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Lord Hall Master taking pity upon them and holding these grand gatherings for them, they would&rsquo;ve long been discarded by the Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, this subordinate is confused,&rdquo; said that old man.<br>&ldquo;What are you confused about?&rdquo; asked the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, the Purple Star Variance Realm is our Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s restricted cultivation ground. Contained inside it is the legendary cultivation treasure. Since the founding of our Purple Star Hall, we have never stopped searching for that treasure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In order to prevent others from obtaining that treasure, even the people from our Purple Star Hall that are allowed to enter it are rigorously filtered.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet now, not only did you allow those ten powers to enter the Purple Star Variance Realm, but you even handed them such precious Star-guiding Stones.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Moreover, you&rsquo;ve even insisted that they must enter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This subordinate is truly unable to understand Lord Hall Master&rsquo;s decision,&rdquo; said that old man.<br>&ldquo;Actually, the reason why I&rsquo;ve done all that is because I had no other choice.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you know why I had them enter the Purple Star Variance Realm now, of all times?&rdquo; asked the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;The Purple Star Variance Beasts are generally hidden deep underground in the Purple Star Variance Realm. Only during specific dates every year will they emerge to the surface to forage.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When the Purple Star Variance Beasts emerge, they will cause changes to the Variance Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The natural energies in the Purple Star Variance Realm will become especially abundant. In fact&hellip; even the legendary cultivation treasure will faintly reveal itself. If one has a strong perception, one will even be able to detect that cultivation treasure&rsquo;s aura.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As such, even though the Purple Star Variance Realm is the most dangerous during this period of time, it is also the most optimal time for one to cultivate. It is also the most optimal time to seek out the cultivation treasure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for this optimal timing, it is occuring right now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the past, Lord Hall master would personally lead our Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s elites and enter the Purple Star Variance Realm to seek out the cultivation treasure. You would not waste the slightest moment.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet this year, not only did you not enter it, but you instead had those trash enter the Purple Star Variance Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This subordinate is truly unable to understand why Milord made this decision,&rdquo; said that old man.<br>&ldquo;Look at this formation.&rdquo;<br>The Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master pointed his finger to the grand formation before him.<br>Although that grand formation was majestic, its contents were not complicated at all.<br>A sheet of blue was surging inside. It resembled a vast sea.<br>However, the location the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master pointed to was different from the other places. While that place was still blue, it was oscillating strangely.<br>&ldquo;This here is the legendary cultivation treasure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Every year, when the time arrives, not only will one be able to sense its aura inside the Purple Star Variance Realm, but its reflection will also be present on this grand formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We all know that this legendary cultivation treasure really exists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ever since the establishment of our Purple Star Hall, we&rsquo;ve been searching for it. Yet, after all these years, not only have we been unable to find it, but we do not even know its appearance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that we&rsquo;ve never attempted to search for it; it&rsquo;s simply that we were truly unable to find it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, now, an opportunity has presented itself to us,&rdquo; said the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Opportunity?&rdquo;<br>That old man&rsquo;s gaze changed upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;You should know that the reason why I was away before was to seek out the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s greatest prophecy master, the All-seeing Heavenly Master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I asked if our Purple Star Hall will be able to find that treasure or not.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The All-seeing Heavenly Master ended up giving me instructions,&rdquo; said the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Instructions? Could the instructions have something to do with the Ten Abandoned Starfields?&rdquo; asked that old man.<br>&ldquo;Correct. The All-seeing Heavenly Master told me that if the people from our Purple Star Hall are the ones to search, we will never be able to find that legendary cultivation treasure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if the overlord powers from the Ten Abandoned Starfields are the one to search, they will be able to find it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, even for the Ten Abandoned Starfields&rsquo; overlord powers, they would still need good luck on their side in order to find it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are a total of three chances. And now&hellip; we&rsquo;ve missed two chances already,&rdquo; said the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Missed two chances? What do you mean?&rdquo; asked that old man.<br>&ldquo;The meaning is that this is the only chance we have left.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The chance is this year during the appearance of the Purple Star Variance Beasts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is why I invited the Ten Abandoned Starfields&rsquo; overlords over at this time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I even went so far as to force them to enter the Purple Star Variance Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The purpose is all so that they can find the legendary cultivation treasure for us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, according to the All-seeing Heavenly Master, this is our final chance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we are to miss out on this year too, we might never be able to find the legendary treasure hidden in the Purple Star Variance Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No one will be able to find it. Even if the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s ruler is to help us, we will still not be able to find it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is not an issue of strength. It&rsquo;s an issue of destiny,&rdquo; said the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Milord, this subordinate understands now. I have wrongly blamed Milord. Please punish this subordinate severely.&rdquo;<br>With a &lsquo;putt,&rsquo; that old man kneeled before the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Get back up. You are my trusted aide, I shouldn&rsquo;t have concealed this matter from you to begin with.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, the All-seeing Heavenly Master said that the mysteries of heaven must not be revealed. Before the people from the Ten Abandoned Starfields enter the Purple Star Variance Realm, I cannot inform anyone about this. Thus, you must not blame me for it either,&rdquo; said the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;This subordinate wouldn&rsquo;t dare blame Milord.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, it would appear that the All-seeing Heavenly Master is truly an extraordinary figure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Purple Star Variance Realm this time around is indeed different from all the other times. That Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief encountered a stroke of luck we&rsquo;ve never encountered before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With how weak he is, he actually discovered an abnormal sign composed of natural energies.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, he used the Star-guiding Stone to absorb the boundless amount of natural energies.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, that was precisely the reason why he ended up having his Star-guiding Stone plundered by another, and nearly lost his life in the process.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for our elders being present, everyone from the Chu Heavenly Clan would&rsquo;ve been silenced.&rdquo;<br>When his words reached this point, that old man seemed to recall something. His complexion changed all of a sudden.<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, that Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief couldn&rsquo;t possibly be the destined individual, right?&rdquo;<br>The reason why he was worried was because the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was seriously injured, and on the verge of death.<br>If the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was the person the All-seeing Heavenly Master spoke of, the person with a destiny capable of finding the legendary cultivation treasure, wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that their Purple Star Hall had lost this final golden opportunity?!<br></p></div>
