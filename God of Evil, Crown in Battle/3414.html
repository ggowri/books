        <h1>Chapter 3413</h1>
        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Ruthlessness<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, what have you done to me?!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a furious shout was heard. It was Linghu Hongfei.<br>Anger filled Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s eyes. There were even traces of killing intent.<br>It was impossible for him to not be furious. After all, the black flames that he had assimilated were suddenly leaving his body uncontrollably, and ultimately assimilating into Chu Feng.<br>He refused to believe that Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t do anything to him.<br>In fact, it was indeed Chu Feng who had caused such a thing to happen.<br>After Chu Feng discovered that Linghu Hongfei was stealing his assimilated black flames, he did not argue with Linghu Hongfei, because he knew that words were meaningless.<br>Instead, Chu Feng decided to act. Using the power that he had obtained from the hidden path, Chu Feng altered the nature of the black flames.<br>Not only had Chu Feng left an imprint on his assimilated black flames, but he also made it so that his imprint could be spread to the rest of the black flames.<br>After the black flames were imprinted, even if they were snatched away by Linghu Hongfei, he would not be able to assimilate with them, as the imprinted black flames belonged completely to Chu Feng. Apart from Chu Feng, no one else could assimilate with them.<br>After the imprinted black flames entered Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s body, they would then assimilate with Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s black flames. Ultimately, all of Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s black flames ended up belonging to Chu Feng, and were under his control.<br>That was the reason why such a scene occurred.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng did something?&rdquo; At the same time Linghu Hongfei questioned Chu Feng, Liangqiu Chengfeng also turned to question Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s most definitely the case. Otherwise, such a thing wouldn&rsquo;t have happened,&rdquo; the worried expression on Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s face had cleared up completely. With a joyous look, he began to gently caress his beard.<br>One could tell that he was very pleasantly surprised by the sudden change.<br>&ldquo;But, how did Chu Feng accomplish such a feat?&rdquo; Liangqiu Chengfeng was completely confused. Those black flames were so very powerful. If Chu Feng was able to control them, wouldn&rsquo;t it be too extraordinary of a feat?<br>&ldquo;Who knows? It must have been very difficult for him to do such a thing. However, in the end, he still succeeded,&rdquo; after Grandmaster Liangqiu finished saying those words, he looked to Linghu Yuhua, who stood beside him. &ldquo;It would appear that your clan&rsquo;s young master has truly met his rival this time around.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t possibly be planning to interfere in a matter between people of the younger generation, right?&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu was actually worried that Linghu Yuhua would try to take care of Chu Feng, since Linghu Hongfei had ended up suffering by Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands.<br>&ldquo;I am only in charge of ensuring Hongfei&rsquo;s safety. As long as no one endangers his life, I will not involve myself in any matter,&rdquo; Linghu Yuhua said. There was no trace of anger on her face. Instead, in her eyes, there was a trace of admiration. &ldquo;Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son is truly extraordinary.&rdquo;<br>Seeing Linghu Yuhua acting like that, Grandmaster Liangqiu felt more at ease in his heart. Linghu Yuhua was someone who would always do as she said. Since she said those words, it meant that she would not try to make things difficult for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I'm talking to you! Don&rsquo;t ignore me!&rdquo; Inside the main formation, Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s voice sounded once more. The anger in his eyes grew even more intense.<br>As his previous shout of anger was ignored by Chu Feng, it caused him, who was already furious with Chu Feng, to feel even more displeased.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly opened his eyes and looked at Linghu Hongfei in a completely confused manner, &ldquo;Brother Linghu, you called me earlier? What do you need?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You despicable bastard! Tell me, what exactly did you do?!&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei asked.<br>&ldquo;Brother Linghu, what are you talking about? How come I don&rsquo;t understand?&rdquo; Chu Feng was not planning to admit to what he had done. It wasn&rsquo;t that he didn&rsquo;t dare to admit to it. Merely, Chu Feng was someone fond of striking back at a shameless individual by being extremely shameless himself.<br>&ldquo;You dare to continue to pretend to not know?! All of the black flames that I&rsquo;ve assimilated ended up rushing to you! Are you trying to tell me that you don't know what happened?!&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei asked.<br>&ldquo;Now that you mention it, why did your black flames come rushing toward me? Even when I refused them, they still insisted on assimilating with me. This is truly strange, exactly what is going on here?&rdquo; Chu Feng spread his hands open and spoke in a completely confused manner.<br>Seeing Chu Feng acting like that, both Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng burst into laughter.<br>Even Linghu Yuhua chuckled.<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanyuan was not as naughty as that child,&rdquo; Linghu Yuhua spoke with a smile on her face.<br>&ldquo;Perhaps he resembles his mother?&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu said.<br>&ldquo;Speaking of it, even now, no one knows who Chu Feng&rsquo;s mother is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If possible, I truly wish to meet her. As a young lady that that brat Chu Xuanyuan took a fancy to, she must be extraordinary,&rdquo; Linghu Yuhua gasped with admiration.<br>&ldquo;Back then, all of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s women admired Chu Xuanyuan wholeheartedly. Yet, he remained completely unmoved by them. A girl who ended up being able to capture Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s heart must be a very extraordinary girl.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If possible, I also wish to meet her,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu nodded his head. It could be seen that he was also very curious as to what sort of person Chu Feng&rsquo;s mother was.<br>The grand characters were chatting merrily outside the grand formation. It was as if they had completely forgotten about their previous unpleasantries.<br>However, inside the grand formation, being faced with such a shameless Chu Feng, the anger in Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s eyes did not decrease in the slightest. Instead, a trace of killing intent emerged in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;d best return all my black flames to me,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei spoke in a commanding tone.<br>&ldquo;Return? I do want to return them. Unfortunately, they refuse to listen to my commands. There&rsquo;s nothing that I can do about it,&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke with a helpless expression.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I'm not joking around with you. If you return them right now, I will pretend that nothing has happened.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, you shall suffer the consequences of your actions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>After his words left his mouth, Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s rank two Exalted aura swept forth from his body.<br>Accompanying the rank two Exalted aura was also Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s killing intent!!!<br>Seeing that Linghu Hongfei planned to attack Chu Feng, both Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng became extremely worried.<br>Compared to others, the two of them knew Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s character pretty well.<br>Linghu Hongfei was most definitely not the good-natured upright gentleman that he appeared to be.<br>Instead, he was an exceptionally ruthless character!!!<br>However, once Linghu Hongfei revealed his killing intent, Chu Feng, who was laughing and smiling earlier, not only showed no sign of fear, but instead became very stern.<br>&ldquo;Linghu Hongfei, if you plan to attack me, I won&rsquo;t stop you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I will tell you this. If you plan to attack me, you&rsquo;d best consider it carefully.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For I am someone who will definitely not stop my hands the moment I begin fighting,&rdquo; he said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, am I mishearing things? You, with your mere Martial Immortal-level cultivation, dare to threaten me?&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei had a face of contempt.<br>As for Chu Feng, he suddenly burst into laughter, &ldquo;If you think that Utmost Exalted-level monster was a fake, and that I obtained my three spirit formation swords through luck, then you can very well give it a try.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng suddenly narrowed his brows, and his gaze became incomparably cold. Even the air surrounding him became frigid.<br>Killing intent. This was Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing intent.<br>After Chu Feng released his killing intent, even the expressions of the three grand characters outside the grand formation changed enormously.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing intent was not only meant to scare people. Instead, it was a killing intent possessed only by those who had endured countless tribulations and massacred countless people, a killing intent possessed by those that were truly ruthless.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, that kid is not as harmless as he appears to be. He is also&hellip; a ruthless character that has massacred countless people,&rdquo; seeing such killing intent from Chu Feng, even Linghu Yuhua was unable to keep herself from gasping in admiration.<br>&ldquo;This aspect of him resembles Chu Xuanyuan a lot. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu looked to Linghu Yuhua.<br>Hearing those words, Linghu Yuhua smiled. Then, she looked back to the grand formation and sighed, &ldquo;That is no longer just resembling, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That gaze of not putting anyone in their eyes, that fearless gaze&hellip; it is simply exactly the same as Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s gaze.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
