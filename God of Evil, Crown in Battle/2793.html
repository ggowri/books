        <h1>Chapter 2792</h1>
        <div> - The Erupting Buried Spirit Lake<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Puuu~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng sprayed out a mouthful of blood.<br>After spraying out a mouthful of blood, he sprayed out another mouthful of blood. One mouthful after another, Chu Feng was vomiting blood nonstop.<br>With each mouthful of blood, Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura would grow a bit weaker. In the end, when Chu Feng stopped vomiting blood, his aura had grown so weak that he was simply akin to a dying man.<br>Chu Feng hurriedly took out some medicinal pellets and tossed them into his mouth. Then, he sat cross-legged and began to set up healing formations to heal himself.<br>Although Chu Feng was unable to immediately recover from his injuries, after treating himself for a while, his complexion was no longer pale and ugly. Furthermore, he had also managed to recover his aura quite a bit.<br>&ldquo;That was truly dangerous. Never would I expect the Five Elements Secret Skills to be the ones to end up saving my life,&rdquo; Chu Feng gasped in admiration.<br>When Chu Feng fused with the Five Elements Secret Skills, he had gained a life-preserving capability.<br>When facing those with strength similar to Chu Feng&rsquo;s, the Five Elements Secret Skills were capable of allowing Chu Feng to be undying and indestructible.<br>In other words, should Chu Feng&rsquo;s opponent not be overwhelmingly stronger than him, they would simply be incapable of killing him.<br>However, after Chu Feng set foot into the True Immortal Realm, even though Chu Feng knew that the Five Elements Secret Skill still possessed that special ability, he did not dare to rely on it.<br>The reason for that was because True Immortals were simply too powerful. One could not compare them with Martial Ancestors or Half Martial Ancestors.<br>Even when facing those with similar strength, Chu Feng felt that the Five Elements Secret Skills would not be able to safeguard him.<br>Thus, it could be said that Chu Feng had decided to take a risk to test things out.<br>As for his test, it verified Chu Feng&rsquo;s hypothesis. Sure enough, after reaching the True Immortal Realm, even when facing those with similar strength to his own, the Five Elements Secret Skills were, at the very most, only capable of safeguarding his life and not preventing injuries. Moreover, the injuries he sustained were quite serious.<br>While Chu Feng had managed to escape death after being attacked by Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s Immortal Technique, he had sustained serious injuries.<br>Of course, it was not only because of Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s attack that Chu Feng became so weak. It was also caused by the backlash Chu Feng received from using both the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe.<br>Although Chu Feng had only used the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe for a short period of time and shouldn&rsquo;t have received such a backlash, Chu Feng was attacked by Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s ferocious Immortal Techniques while he was using his Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe. That greatly consumed Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength.<br>Under such circumstances, it would instead be strange if Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t receive a backlash.<br>&ldquo;It was truly too dangerous. What if your Five Elements Secret Skills failed to withstand Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s attack?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You were able to utilize the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe and the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword to fight her one last time. There was simply no need for you to do such a dangerous thing.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, an expression of complaint filled Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s little face.<br>It turned out, Chu Feng had not only deliberately allowed himself to be attacked by Xia Yun&rsquo;er, but he had even deliberately pretended to be unable to use his Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe and Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword anymore.<br>Although using the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe again would indeed put an enormous burden on Chu Feng, it was clear that Chu Feng had not yet reached his limit.<br>He had deliberately pretended to have reached his limit and deliberately allowed himself to be struck by Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s attack so that he could flee using the undying ability of the Five Elements Secret Skills.<br>In other words, if Chu Feng were to continue using his Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe, he would still have been capable of fighting against Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>Yet, Chu Feng decided to trust the Five Elements Secret Skills even though he did not have any certainty in whether or not it would be capable of handling Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s attack. He was indeed taking chances.<br>It was no wonder Her Lady Queen was angry at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;My dear Eggy, don&rsquo;t be angry. Firstly, the Five Elements Secret Skills have fused with me. I am able to sense their strength. Even though the Five Elements Secret Skills are no longer capable of providing me with an undying and indestructible body and the ability to remain uninjured before those with similar strength to my own, I was able to tell that they were still capable of providing me with an undying and indestructible body. At the very most, I&rsquo;ll suffer some injuries.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why I attempted to use the Five Elements Secret Skills is firstly because I wanted to verify my guess. Secondly, I felt that the current me was no match for that Xia Yun&rsquo;er. Even if I were to continue to use the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe, I would still not be a match for her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know that girl grasped a great number of Immortal Techniques?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;She had only revealed three Immortal Techniques so far. I was unable to be certain as to whether or not she possessed any other Immortal Techniques, and whether those Immortal Techniques might be even stronger,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, that girl is quite powerful. Last time, when Chu Xianshuo used his single Immortal Technique, he ended up suffering from quite a backlash, and simply lost the capability to continue fighting against you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, that girl actually managed to unleash three Immortal Techniques in succession. Furthermore, her three Immortal Techniques were each stronger than the last. This means that the burden upon her body from the three Immortal Techniques would each be more serious than the last.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, that girl appeared to be completely fine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps your decision to use the Five Elements Secret Skills to escape was correct. However, it remains to be too dangerous. Next time around, you must first obtain this Queen&rsquo;s approval before doing such a thing,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;Hehe, I will do as you bid, Milady Queen,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled. Then, he gasped with admiration, &ldquo;Although the Five Elements Secret Skills are inferior to what they were before now that my strength has increased, they still possess an enormous effect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, the Four Symbols Secret Skills that I obtained first are of very little use.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I grow ever more curious as to exactly what sort of individual the creator of the Five Elements Secret Skills, that Five Elements Old Ancestor, was. He must have been extremely powerful. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to have created such a powerful set of secret skills.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Ancestral Martial Lower Realm should have been very powerful during the Ancient Era. Thus, it is normal for experts to emerge there,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Grumble, grumble, grumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, the water in Buried Spirit Lake&rsquo;s suddenly started to boil.<br>Upon closer inspection, it didn&rsquo;t seem to be boiling. Rather, water ripples were battering upward from the depths of Buried Spirit Lake.<br>&ldquo;This sensation, could it be that the eruption is about to arrive?&rdquo; Chu Feng said in surprise.<br>The reason why Chu Feng said it like this was because he did not wish for the eruption to arrive yet.<br>After all, Chu Feng had yet to completely heal his injuries. Thus, he was not at his optimal state.<br>Since one needed to comprehend the contents of the eruption, Chu Feng would naturally want to be in his best state. He did not wish to attempt comprehension in an injured state.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, a loud explosion sounded from the depths of Buried Spirit Lake. Soon, runes and symbols visible to the naked eye erupted from the depths of the lake like a massive, densely-packed army.<br>This was truly the arrival of what one fears.<br>The eruption of Buried Spirit Lake actually really arrived.<br>Furthermore, the speed of the eruption was simply too fast. Soon, the runes and symbols charged past Chu Feng and engulfed him completely.<br>Not only that, but the power of the eruption was still rushing upward. In merely a short moment, they reached the surface of Buried Spirit Lake.<br>This eruption that happened once every ten years and lasted for only a single day had finally begun.<br><br><br>Check out the June Giveaway for a chance to win $200, $100 or $50 Visa Gift Card<br><br></p></div>
