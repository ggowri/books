        <h1>Chapter 5326</h1>
        <div>: I Won&rsquo;t Abandon You<br>Chu Feng and the others encountered numerous formations along their way, but they managed to overcome them and advance ahead. That being said, they had to admit that the final test was indeed challenging. The formations got increasingly harder along the way.<br>Even Bai Yunqing was starting to run out of stamina. Thus, Chu Feng told him to take a rest for the time being while he continued breaching the formations.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, you should rest too. There&rsquo;s no time restriction. There&rsquo;s no need for us to rush so much,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing advised.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m not tired.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t lying when he said those words. His psyche was much stronger than most cultivators, which allowed him to stave off exhaustion better than others. Even prodigies could hardly match him in that regard.<br>He was in a rush because he had noticed how time-consuming it was to breach the formations here. The poison on Zhou Dong and the others would only last sixty hours, but it looked like they were nowhere close to completing the final test.<br>It was unlikely that Chu Feng and the others would be able to clear the test within sixty hours.<br>On top of that, this place didn&rsquo;t allow them to turn back. They couldn&rsquo;t return and free Zhou Dong and the others anymore even if they wanted to. Their only option was to quickly breach the formations in their way and advance as fast as they could.<br>Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy for Zhou Dong and the others to catch up with them considering the sixty-hour lead they had, and the formations along the way weren&rsquo;t that easy to deal with. Nevertheless, it would be foolish to let down their guard because of that.<br>Chu Feng had noticed in their earlier collaboration that Zhou Dong was a competent world spiritist. Just to be safe, he decided that they should make haste.<br>Even so, he didn&rsquo;t think that it was enough so he resorted to setting up his own obstacles too.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, why are you setting up obstacles? Are you worried that they&rsquo;ll catch up with us?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.<br>&ldquo;Just in case,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;You sure are thorough.&rdquo;<br>Bai Yunqing was impressed. He had been to many remnants too, but he was nowhere close to being as meticulous as Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, just out of curiosity, would you have killed those three if the others from the Bluemoon Sacred Palace, Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect, and Pill Dao Immortal Sect weren&rsquo;t waiting outside?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have killed them unless they tried to,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting more and more curious to know who is backing you,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing remarked.<br>&ldquo;No one is backing me.&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Are you for real?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing was baffled. &ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, stop pulling my leg.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t have any backing,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;How did you grow so strong if you didn&rsquo;t have anyone backing you?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.<br>&ldquo;Someone taught me before, but it&rsquo;s also true that I don&rsquo;t have anyone backing me right now,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>Bai Yunqing was initially doubtful about Chu Feng&rsquo;s reply, which was why he carefully assessed his reaction when asking follow-up questions, but it didn&rsquo;t seem like Chu Feng was lying to him.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder you&rsquo;re so meticulous. It must have been difficult for you.&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s admiration for Chu Feng deepened.<br>It was only because he had his master&rsquo;s backing that he didn&rsquo;t fear Jia Chengying and the others. If not for that, he would have never dared to cross individuals of their standing.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, I don&rsquo;t advise you to take their lives if you don&rsquo;t have any backing. While those three will surely try to get back at you, that would have been scoped as a petty conflict between juniors. Their backing would think that it&rsquo;s too trivial for them to get involved.<br>&ldquo;But if you kill them, their respective backing would have a legitimate reason to go after you. I don&rsquo;t think that I have to say this, but none of those three powerhouses are to be trifled with. If they choose to go after you, you&rsquo;re pretty much doomed,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.<br>&ldquo;Are you afraid of them?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I have my master to back me up, so I&rsquo;m not afraid of them&hellip; but even so, I don&rsquo;t dare to take their lives. That would make things difficult for my master,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.<br>Chu Feng knew that Bai Yunqing was saying these for his own good, so he replied, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me. I have my own way out.&rdquo;<br>The three of them continued marching ahead.<br>After breaching many more formations, they finally exited the cavern and arrived at the edge of a steep cliff. Almost as if they had reached the end of the world, they saw a beautiful starry sky presented right before their eyes. It felt like they were seeing the entire world of cultivation.<br>There was no more path ahead of them. What laid before them was an endless abyss obscured by a thick fog.<br>&ldquo;This again?&rdquo;<br>Bai Yunqing scanned his surroundings with glowing eyes, but he couldn&rsquo;t find anything at all.<br>Similarly, Chu Feng tried using his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes but it didn&rsquo;t work. He also tried bringing out the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk, but it refused to react. Even so, he could sense unknown dangers lurking inside the fog.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, look at the wall behind you,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing suddenly said.<br>There were runes inscribed on the cliff face, containing crucial information and a formation.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a formation that grants us power. It&rsquo;s likely that there&rsquo;s a terrifying existence lurking inside the abyss, or else there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any need to leave behind such a formation here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He had already noticed and deciphered the runes shortly after they arrived here.<br>Bai Yunqing also tried to read the runes. A moment later, his eyes widened in awe and he exclaimed, &ldquo;Big brother, just how sharp are your eyes? How are you able to decipher the runes so quickly?&rdquo;<br>Shoosh!<br>The white-haired woman suddenly pointed her finger at the abyss. She manifested a sword out of her martial power and plunged it into the abyss.<br>It was a tremendously powerful attack, but it didn&rsquo;t generate any response at all. It didn&rsquo;t even disperse the fog shrouding the abyss.<br>&ldquo;Let me give it a try,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He released his spirit power and constructed a formation. The formation soon morphed into a clone that was identical to him in every way, be it in terms of its aura or its appearance. As soon as it was formed, the clone rose to the air and charged into the abyss.<br>All of a sudden, a shrill cry reverberated in the air.<br>A massive spider with bat wings suddenly appeared amidst the fog and gobbled Chu Feng&rsquo;s clone whole. It was only a hundred meters long, nowhere on par with the truly huge monstrous beasts, but the oppressive might it emanated was much more terrifying.<br>&ldquo;Pinnacle Half-God level!&rdquo; the white-haired woman remarked with an uneasy look.<br>Even she was powerless against such tremendous power.<br>To make things worse, the spider didn&rsquo;t return to the fog after devouring Chu Feng&rsquo;s clone. Instead, it flapped its gigantic wings while viciously glaring at Chu Feng and the others.<br>Shoosh!<br>A massive octopus tentacle covered in disgusting black hair suddenly shot out from the abyss and wrapped itself around the spider. This single tentacle was already much larger than the spider, which meant that its full body was likely to be at least several thousand meters long.<br>But what Chu Feng and the others were more concerned with was the strength displayed by the tentacle. The tentacle was able to easily crush the life out of the pinnacle Half-God level spider, suggesting that the monstrous beast behind it was at least at True God level.<br>Fortunately, the frightening tentacle didn&rsquo;t go after Chu Feng and the others. After killing the spider, it simply dragged its carcass down into the abyss.<br>&ldquo;It seems like the tentacle doesn&rsquo;t plan to attack us unless we enter the abyss,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s focus on breaching the formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he made his way toward the formation.<br>Bai Yunqing and the white-haired woman did as they were told. Having witnessed the prowess of the monstrous beasts inside the abyss, they knew that they couldn&rsquo;t possibly travel across the abyss with their own strength. They would require the formation&rsquo;s power for that.<br>Chu Feng dove right into constructing a formation. Bai Yunqing took some time to examine the formation in order to figure out the best way to deal with it. The white-haired woman stared at the formation for a brief moment before turning her head away.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Miss Bai?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand the formation,&rdquo; the white-haired woman replied.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your current level of spirit power?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t feel distressed over this, Miss Bai. This formation is indeed a tough nut to crack. Even ordinary Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists would struggle to deal with this formation, so it&rsquo;s only normal that you&rsquo;d face difficulty understanding it,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing replied.<br>Even he had to spend a fair bit of effort to obtain the energy inside the formation.<br>On the bright side, the energy inside the formation was more than enough to deal with the monsters inside the abyss. As long as he and Chu Feng obtained the formation&rsquo;s energy, they would be able to escort the white-haired woman to the other side.<br>Moments later, Bai Yunqing sat down and swiftly constructed a formation. Energy began surging into his body as soon as he activated his formation. The source of the energy was boundless, but there was a limit to how much he could absorb.<br>By the time he reached his limit, his spirit power had already risen to a level comparable to a rank one True God level cultivator.<br>&ldquo;So, this is how a True God level cultivator feels. Exhilarating!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing was overjoyed.<br>This power boost might only be temporary, but he was confident in his own talents. He believed that it was only a matter of time before he reached True God level.<br>&ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He had already finished absorbing the energy, and just like Bai Yunqing, his current strength was comparable to a rank one True God level cultivator.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, you&rsquo;re at rank one True God level too?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing was surprised. He thought that Chu Feng would be able to siphon more energy away than him.<br>&ldquo;This is the limit of what the formation is willing to provide me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>He had tried to absorb more energy from the formation, but it refused to grant him power beyond rank one True God level.<br>&ldquo;Ah&hellip; You&rsquo;re making me feel embarrassed. Rank one True God level is already my limit,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing replied with a bitter smile.<br>Shoosh shoosh!<br>With a few strokes of his fingers, Chu Feng drew out a formation blueprint in mid-air.<br>&ldquo;Miss Bai, construct this formation inside your body. I&rsquo;ll help you obtain energy from the formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What an ingenious formation!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing exclaimed in awe.<br>What was formidable about this formation was how it had been simplified to allow weaker world spiritists like the white-haired woman to construct it too without compromising its effectiveness. Only a true master of world spiritist techniques could come up with something like that.<br>At the very least, Bai Yunqing knew that it was beyond his current means to pull off.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that. Only one person will benefit from this final test anyway. Given my weak spirit power, I ought to halt my footsteps here.&rdquo; The white-haired woman rejected Chu Feng&rsquo;s goodwill.<br>&ldquo;Miss Bai, we are a team. Since we came here together, we should leave this place together too. It&rsquo;s one thing if we encounter an obstacle that we can&rsquo;t overcome, but that&rsquo;s clearly not the case here. There&rsquo;s no reason for us to abandon you here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>There was a chance that Zhou Dong and the others might reach here before they cleared the final test; that could potentially place the white-haired woman in danger. For that reason, Chu Feng was unwilling to leave her there.<br>Of course, he and Bai Yunqing could also have easily escorted the white-haired woman across the abyss with their current strength, but he figured that it would be better for the white-haired woman to acquire the energy too so that she could protect herself. She would also feel less of a burden that way.<br></div>
