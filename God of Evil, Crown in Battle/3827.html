        <div> - Threat From Yin Zhuanghong<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Girl, you are truly cold. Since you already knew who I was, why didn&rsquo;t you say hello to me?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Did you greet me?&rdquo; asked Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;I was trying to give you a pleasant surprise. Aiyo, that tone of yours, could it be that you&rsquo;re angry because I didn&rsquo;t greet you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother wasting time. proceed with breaching the formation." Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s voice turned cold.<br>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng guessed that she might really be angry. Thus, he stopped teasing her and started acting.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, light started shining. That light actually overshadowed the tide of talismans.<br>It was Chu Feng. The dazzling light came from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>&ldquo;Am I seeing things?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That guy, he&rsquo;s actually a Saint-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the people of the younger generation were unable to keep calm. This was especially so for Meng Rufei. He was completely stunned, and complicated emotions filled his eyes.<br>If Chu Feng were only a rank two Exalted, they would still be able to accept it. After all, there were simply too many people with the cultivation of rank two Exalted in the Reincarnation Upper Realm.<br>However, Saint-cloak World Spiritists were a completely different story. They were extremely sparse in the entire Reincarnation Upper Realm, and even the entire All-heaven Starfield.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques had made the crowd realize that even if he was a senior, he was no ordinary senior.<br>That was because he was actually a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>While the people of the younger generation were gasping with shock and admiration, Chu Feng had begun his performance.<br>Boundless spirit power started confronting the talisman tide.<br>Soon, the talisman tide was engulfed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power.<br>After the tide was engulfed, multiple treasures appeared.<br>There were medicinal herbs, stones, steel, and all sorts of materials that world spiritists could use to concoct and refine items with.<br>Those materials were all of excellent quality. Even those famed geniuses salivated at the sight of them.<br>In fact, those materials were very useful for even Chu Feng.<br>With a wave of his sleeve, he gathered all the materials into a Cosmos Sack. Then, he handed the Cosmos Sack to Fan Chou. &ldquo;Brother Fan Chou, these are yours.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, I cannot accept them. I truly cannot accept them. They are clearly your rewards, how could you give them to me?&rdquo; Fan Chou gestured with his hand and attempted to refuse.<br>Chu Feng forcibly pushed the Cosmos Sack into Fan Chou&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;That key belonged to you. If it wasn&rsquo;t for you, how could I obtain these? Besides, my goal is not these things either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Fan Chou, you might not be able to continue onward. Thus, accept these things. If the chance presents itself, I will come see you," said Chu Feng.<br>After hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, the crowd all turned their gazes back to the open copper gate.<br>Upon doing so, they discovered that the insides of the gate were actually covered in flames.<br>The flames were ferocious. Seeing them, the majority of the crowd were all afraid to proceed into the gate.<br>Actually, if Chu Feng wanted to protect Fan Chou and journey onwards together, he was totally capable of it.<br>However, since only a single person was able to see Yuan Shu, even if Chu Feng were to protect Fan Chou and pass through the corridor of flames, Fan Chou was still destined to be eliminated later on.<br>Only Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong set foot into the flame corridor.<br>Meng Rufei was originally also able to enter the flame corridor. However, he had been seriously injured by Chu Feng. Thus, he was no longer capable of entering the flame corridor. Besides, even if he could enter, he had decided not to.<br>Chu Feng was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Furthermore, his cultivation surpassed his own. When all aspects of himself were inferior to his opponent, even if he decided to enter the flame corridor, he would only be asking for trouble.<br>&ldquo;Young Master Meng, are you alright?&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong disappeared into the flame corridor, the people of the younger generation all rushed over to Meng Rufei, eager to help him treat his injuries.<br>Meng Rufei did not pay attention to them. Instead, his gaze was fixed onto the location where Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong had disappeared. Killing intent filled his eyes.<br>&ldquo;I truly don&rsquo;t know what Grandmaster Yuan Shu is doing. We are clearly all people of the younger generation, why would he bring in such a malignant star?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. This is simply too unfair.&rdquo;<br>The people of the younger generation not only cursed and insulted Chu Feng, but they even turned their criticism towards Grandmaster Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Earlier when I was chatting with brother Asura, he said he was a person of the younger generation,&rdquo; said Fan Chou. He wanted to eliminate the prejudice the others had against Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You trust everything he said? Are you stupid?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph, a damned lackey.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best shut your mouth. Your master is no longer here, so no one will shield you. Do not provoke me, or I&rsquo;ll beat you up so bad that you&rsquo;ll be looking for your teeth all over the floor.&rdquo;<br>Fan Chou&rsquo;s words were met with criticism and hostility from the other younger generations.<br>They seemed as if they would give him a ruthless beating should he dare utter another word.<br>With the situation being like that, Fan Chou smiled bitterly and said no more.<br>Those people of the younger generation were all people that took advantage of their status to bully others.<br>Earlier, Chu Feng had treated them extremely badly. Due to a mere conflict of words, he had decided to seriously injure them. His behavior was simply that of a bully.<br>Fan Chou had thought that Chu Feng was being excessive.<br>However, looking at it now, Fan Chou felt that Chu Feng was not excessive at all.<br>Those guys truly needed to be taught a lesson.<br>Especially now, after hearing how those people planned to teach Chu Feng a lesson, Fan Chou became even more certain of that.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong continued onward.<br>Yin Zhuanghong did not voluntarily speak to Chu Feng.<br>However, she would always respond to him whenever he spoke to her.<br>Although she was still cold, she was, by comparison, much more cordial to Chu Feng than to Meng Rufei.<br>The two of them continued for only a short while when a grand formation appeared before them.<br>Upon entering the grand formation, Yin Zhuanghong was immediately restricted by the powerful formation. Because of that, Chu Feng could only attempt to breach the formation on his own.<br>It took Chu Feng an entire hour to breach the grand formation.<br>After he breached the spirit formation, the spirit formation turned into a strand of light and descended into his hand.<br>It was a title plate.<br>After that title plate appeared, a spirit formation gate over three thousand meters in height appeared before Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong.<br>The spirit formation gate gave off the same aura as Chu Feng&rsquo;s title plate.<br>Chu Feng realized that he would need to use the title plate in order to pass through the spirit formation gate.<br>That spirit formation from earlier was very possibly the final test. And now, Chu Feng&hellip; was the final victor.<br>He was qualified to meet Grandmaster Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Give me the title plate.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, an ice-cold voice sounded from behind Chu Feng.<br>It was Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Chu Feng turned around, and discovered that Yin Zhuanghong not only had an ice-cold expression on her face, but her expression was also extremely grave.<br>Furthermore, a threat could be seen deep within her eyes.<br>It appeared that if Chu Feng did not hand her the title plate, she would immediately attack him.<br></p></div>
