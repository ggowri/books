        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, your father is indeed very powerful.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eggy was excited to learn that Chu Feng&rsquo;s father had stolen something away from such a dangerous woman, since it meant that he was even stronger than her. Chu Feng also realized the same thing as well, but he knew this wasn&rsquo;t the time to be impressed by his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, he was going to suffer for his father&rsquo;s deed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t afraid?&rdquo; the woman asked upon seeing how Chu Feng was unfazed by her declaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, I have heard about your reputation. It&rsquo;d be a lie to say that I&rsquo;m not afraid,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Rumors are not necessarily true,&rdquo; the woman said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod, thinking that the woman&rsquo;s words meant that there could be a way for them to talk things out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;But the rumors about me are true,&rdquo; the woman said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng was rendered speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The son repays the father&rsquo;s debt. Get something for me, and I&rsquo;ll spare you,&rdquo; the woman said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What do you require, elder?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Blood Gathering Red Lotus,&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;You can find it at the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know where it is?&rdquo; the woman asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, I have always kept a low profile, and I am not fond of talking with others. I&rsquo;m afraid that there&rsquo;s much that I don&rsquo;t know about the world,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You claim to be low profile when even the Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s princess is your friend?&rdquo; the woman frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Well&hellip; there&rsquo;s no conflict between the two,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Figure that out by yourself. I&rsquo;ll give you ten days. If you don&rsquo;t return with the Blood Gathering Red Lotus within ten days, you&rsquo;ll never see your little princess ever again. Also, you shouldn&rsquo;t even think of calling others here to save her,&rdquo; the woman said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Rest assured, elder. I won&rsquo;t inform others about this matter. May I ask for more time though?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Ten days is plenty. If you can&rsquo;t even bring me the Blood Gathering Red Lotus within ten days, it&rsquo;d only mean that you earnestly wish for her death,&rdquo; the woman said as she vanished into thin air. Only her voice continued to echo in Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng quickly headed to a crowded city to gather information about the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild. He swiftly learned that the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild was a massive guild that conducted businesses throughout the entire world of cultivation. They were the largest commercial guild in the world of cultivation, trading cultivators&rsquo; and world spiritists&rsquo; treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew who was behind the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild, but it was said that they were extremely powerful. Those who dared to rob the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild often suffered tragic fates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild operated in all of the galaxies, with the exception of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy and the Nine Souls Galaxy. Coincidentally, the realm Chu Feng was at had a Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild Branch. It was some distance away, but he should be able to travel there and return within a day&rsquo;s time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman wasn&rsquo;t lying when she said that ten days was plenty of time for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That being said, Chu Feng knew that the item the woman wanted must be invaluable. To avoid mishaps, he decided to head to the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild as fast as he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild was a massive city filled with countless cultivators and world spiritists. The guild had many guards dressed in the same uniform patrolling the area, but what was shocking was that their cultivation ranged from Martial Exalted level to Half-God level. That was considered extremely powerful for this realm, but they were only serving as guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This indirectly showed how influential the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many shops inside the city operated by external vendors. They had rented those shops from the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild to conduct business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Blood Gathering Red Lotus? I have never heard about that. Why don&rsquo;t you check with the guild center?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng paid a visit to all of the medicinal herb stores in the vicinity, but all of them gave him the same suggestion. Thus, he made his way to the guild center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guild center was the store operated by the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild. A young and beautiful female receptionist welcomed Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young master, are you looking to purchase a Blood Gathering Red Lotus?&rdquo; the female receptionist asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes lit up. At the very least, the female receptionist had heard about the medicinal herb. So, he quickly asked, &ldquo;Is it available here?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It is. We are holding our monthly auction very soon, and there&rsquo;ll be Blood Gathering Red Lotus available there,&rdquo; the female receptionist said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;When will the auction be held?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You arrived just on time. It&rsquo;ll be held today,&rdquo; the female receptionist said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Has it started yet?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Not yet, but it&rsquo;s going to start soon,&rdquo; the woman said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; Chu Feng breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young master, pardon me when I say this, but the auction price of the Blood Gathering Red Lotus will be pricy due to its rarity,&rdquo; the female receptionist advised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How expensive will it be?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;To better facilitate trade, the currency used in our auctions are our guild&rsquo;s sycees. A normal Exalted Armament is worth a sycee, whereas the starting bid for the Blood Gathering Red Lotus will be a thousand sycees,&rdquo; the female receptionist said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hoh! That&rsquo;s really expensive,&rdquo; Eggy remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng also thought that the Blood Gathering Red Lotus was rather pricy, considering that it was worth a thousand normal Exalted Armament. To make things worse, this was the starting bid. It was possible for the price to be hiked up dozens and even hundreds of times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, Chu Feng was determined to obtain it since Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> life was at stake here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The female receptionist had been keeping a close eye on Chu Feng since revealing its price and from Chu Feng&rsquo;s contemplative expression, she deemed him to be someone incapable of forking out the money. Even the normal young masters and young misses from powerhouses wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be able to come up with that much money, after all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she had a good impression of Chu Feng, he didn&rsquo;t seem to be a particularly influential individual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young master, I am not looking down on you, but the Blood Gathering Red Lotus is beyond what most people can afford. Please feel free to speak to me if you have any other requests,&rdquo; the female receptionist said as she settled down on her chair and picked up her teacup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was subtly sending Chu Feng out through her gestures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, Chu Feng took out a spear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How many sycees can I get for this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; The female receptionist raised her head to take a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pu!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The female receptionist immediately spat out her tea as soon as she saw the spear in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands. Even so, she quickly shot to her feet and carefully studied the spear. She had seen all kinds of treasures in the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild, which was why she could tell with a glance that the spear was a </span><span>GodArmament</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young master, where did you obtain this item from?&rdquo; the female receptionist asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both her tone and gaze had already changed by this point.</span></p></div>
