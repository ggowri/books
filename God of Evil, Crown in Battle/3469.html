        <h1>Chapter 3468</h1>
        <div> - Frightening Everyone<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange, I&rsquo;ve heard that an Upper Realm Gate has opened between the Li Heavenly Clan and the Chu Heavenly Clan. The two clans are already hostile powers, destined to battle one another.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, why would Li Ruochu support Chu Feng like this? Even if it&rsquo;s merely to gamble, when considering her clan&rsquo;s standpoint, she shouldn&rsquo;t be betting on Chu Feng, no?&rdquo;<br>Soon, some well-informed people reacted to what was happening.<br>The Li Heavenly Clan and the Chu Heavenly Clan were hostile powers.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t feel any pressure. I, your big sister am merely showing a bit of my kind regards to support and encourage you. As for the outcome of the competition, you don't have to worry about it,&rdquo; right at that moment, Li Ruochu spoke with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist respectfully toward Li Ruochu.<br>At that moment, the crowd became even more puzzled.<br>They were clearly people from hostile powers. Yet, their behavior simply did not resemble that of enemies at all. Instead, they resembled people of the same family.<br>&ldquo;Big sister?&rdquo; At that moment, Gong Mingyue started to frown. A kind of unspeakable sensation was present in her heart.<br>Li Ruochu stood there in a radiating manner with a red dress. Gong Mingyue felt that even women of Linghu Yueyue and Tantai Xing&rsquo;er&rsquo;s caliber would be overshadowed by her.<br>Although she was a very conceited person, Gong Mingyue was also someone who knew her worth. She felt that if she were to be compared to Li Ruochu, she would simply not be on the same level at all.<br>Yet, a woman like her actually addressed herself as Chu Feng&rsquo;s big sister?<br>&lsquo;Exactly how many people does that Chu Feng know?&rsquo; Gong Mingyue thought. She was now certain that Tantai Xing&rsquo;er holding a gathering of the younger generation for Chu Feng and the Starfield Master Realm&rsquo;s acknowledgement of Chu Feng were definitely not a coincidence.<br>He most definitely possessed a remarkable background.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Ruochu is truly magnanimous. You&rsquo;ve actually used fifty million Immortal Martial Stones to show your kind regards. In that case, this old man will also have to show my kind regards.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, the outcome of the competition is of no concern. You merely need to enjoy yourself in this selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice sounded. It was Wuming Xingyun. He had walked out from the warship.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Lord Wuming Xingyun! Could it be&hellip; he&rsquo;s also planning to support Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing Wuming Xingyun, the crowd that was already in an uproar burst into an even stronger uproar.<br>If Li Ruochu was a grand character among the younger generations, then Wuming Xingyun would be a grand character among the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield. He was truly a grand individual.<br>Furthermore, he had never shown any support for anyone before. Even when Linghu Hongfei was a participant in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars, he still did not show any support for him.<br>It was simply an unprecedented act for him to stand forth and support someone. Furthermore, his unprecedented support was actually toward Chu Feng, the person that everyone looked down on. It would only be natural for the crowd to feel astonished.<br>To be able to make someone who didn&rsquo;t gamble bet on you was most definitely a skill.<br>&ldquo;There seems to be Immortal Martial Stones inside the sphere on his hand. He&rsquo;s not joking around, Lord Wuming Xingyun is&hellip; really planning to support Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>Soon, people noticed that the sphere in Wuming Xingyun&rsquo;s hand contained Immortal Martial Stones. However, due to the fact that the sphere was a spirit formation, they were unable to see through it to determine exactly how many Immortal Martial Stones were in there.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, there,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Wuming Xingyun raised his arm. The sphere on his palm streaked across the sky, forming a dazzling curve.<br>When that sphere reached the peak of its arc, it suddenly shattered.<br>In an instant, countless dazzling lights, like a river of stars, flew toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s crystal pillar.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Am I seeing things? That seems to be&hellip; a billion Immortal Martial Stones?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A billion! It&rsquo;s actually really a billion! Lord Wuming Xingyun actually bet a total of a billion Immortal Martial Stones from the get-go?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, it was no longer only the people from the younger generation that were astonished; even those from the older generation were completely astonished.<br>A billion Immortal Martial Stones was not a small amount for any power. In fact, the total wealth that they possessed might not even amount to a billion Immortal Martial Stones.<br>When Li Ruochu&rsquo;s fifty million Immortal Martial Stones were already capable of astonishing the crowd, one could well imagine what sort of shock Wuming Xingyun&rsquo;s billion Immortal Martial Stones would give them.<br>&ldquo;Wuming Xingyun, I&rsquo;ve known you for so long, yet it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve seen you acting so magnanimously.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice was suddenly heard.<br>Looking toward the voice, the expressions of everyone present changed.<br>Four people were flying over.<br>They were the Queen Mother Fox Immortal, Liangqiu Chengfeng, Grandmaster Long Xuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Those four people were all greatly renowned individuals in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Adding Wuming Xingyun, it would mean that the majority of the most powerful world spiritists of the Ancestral Martial Starfield were all gathered there.<br>This was especially true for Grandmaster Liangqiu, as he was the publicly accepted number one world spiritist of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Furthermore, there were now rumors that Grandmaster Liangqiu had attained an unprecedented level that surpassed all others, and had become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist!!!<br>Generally, such grand characters only showed themselves very rarely. For all of them to appear together at that moment was truly a pleasant surprise.<br>&ldquo;Fox Immortal, since you&rsquo;ve already come, why not show some support for young friend Chu Feng?&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun asked.<br>&ldquo;Ah? Could it be that even Queen Mother Fox Immortal knows Chu Feng?&rdquo; The crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed upon hearing Wuming Xingyun&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;Truth be told, we&rsquo;ve come here today precisely to see young friend Chu Feng,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Long Xuan. After he finished saying those words, he even looked to Grandmaster Liangqiu. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that right, Grandmaster Liangqiu?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu nodded.<br>&ldquo;This!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd&rsquo;s faces were no longer only covered in surprise. Many people were completely frightened by what they'd just heard.<br>It would be one thing if Grandmaster Long Xuan was joking around. However, Grandmaster Liangqiu actually nodded to it. It meant that he had acknowledged that grand characters like themselves were actually there for Chu Feng.<br>Exactly what sort of story did Chu Feng possess? How exactly did he know all those grand characters?<br>Furthermore, how did he obtain the acknowledgement of these grand characters?<br>The crowd were all feeling completely overwhelmed, and were filled with questions.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, this is my kind regards,&rdquo; suddenly, Grandmaster Liangqiu spoke. At the same time, he raised his arm, and a dazzling light flew out from his hand.<br>&ldquo;That&hellip; is actually two billion Immortal Martial Stones!!!&rdquo; The crowd opened their mouths wide in shock. However, before they could close their mouths, they opened their mouths even wider.<br>The reason for that was because, immediately after Grandmaster Liangqiu placed his bet, Grandmaster Long Xuan also revealed his bet.<br>His bet was also two billion Immortal Martial Stones!!!<br>Furthermore, after Grandmaster Long Xuan, Liangqiu Chengfeng also placed his bet. Although his bet was not as high as Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan&rsquo;s, it was still a billion Immortal Martial Stones.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, your aunty I am not someone fond of saving up Immortal Martial Stones. Thus, the amount of Immortal Martial Stones I possess is limited. You must not take offense to that,&rdquo; the Queen Mother Fox Immortal said in a slightly embarrassed manner.<br>Upon hearing those words, the crowd thought that she would place a relatively small bet on Chu Feng.<br>However, to their surprise, after Queen Mother Fox Immortal raised her arm, a total of eight hundred million Immortal Martial Stones flew toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s crystal pillar.<br>At that moment, many of the people present were completely dumbfounded.<br>A total of eight hundred million Immortal Martial Stones, yet she said it was a small amount? How could it be a small amount? Exactly how was that a small amount?<br>The crowd felt themselves to be extremely poor. The small amount in the eyes of those grand characters was simply astronomical to them. In fact, it was wealth impossible for many people to obtain in their entire lives.<br>Yet, they cast such astronomical amounts of wealth so casually as bets. Although very few people had bet on Chu Feng, after the bets from those grand characters, the amount of Immortal Martial Stones in the crystal pillar before Chu Feng far surpassed the others.<br>At that moment, the entire region had become strangely quiet.<br>The crowd were all terrified by Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others.<br>After a short moment of silence, the crowd burst into an unprecedented uproar.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, let me bet on you too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, many people began to bet on Chu Feng.<br>Even though they did not know how strong Chu Feng might be, they felt that Chu Feng must be very powerful after witnessing the amount of Immortal Martial Stones that Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others had bet on him. Thus, they&rsquo;d decided to gamble on him.<br>&ldquo;Mad! They&rsquo;ve all gone mad! That guy is clearly trash, how could they support him like that?!!!&rdquo;<br>Many people that were not fond of Chu Feng burst into a rage. This was especially true for the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations. Not only were they shivering with anger, but they also felt their chests feeling squeezed, seemingly on the verge of vomiting blood.<br>The person that they looked down on the most, the person that they felt the most hatred and disgust toward, actually obtained the acknowledgement and support of so many grand characters. Most importantly, those grand characters were all people that they would not be able to approach in their entire lives.<br>Thinking of that, they felt even more unwell, and began to feel even more jealousy and hatred toward Chu Feng.<br>That said, compared to them, Gong Mingyue did not utter a single word.<br>As matters stood, she had completely realized the disparity between her and Chu Feng.<br>Even if Chu Feng was trash, even if he was only a rank one True Immortal, so what?<br>He was able to gain a favorable impression from all those grand characters. Merely that was a feat that she, Gong Mingyue, would not be able to achieve.<br></p></div>
