        <h1>Chapter 5638: Someone With a Strong Backing</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the trial ended, the tens of millions of juniors in the waiting room had been reduced to a hundred thousand. However, these hundred thousand juniors were true prodigies who had cleared the three trials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of them gave off an air of triumph. Those who were extroverted offered their congratulations to one another, whereas those who were introverted could hardly conceal their glee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a huge honor they could brag about for their life even if they failed to enter the mansion. However, their laughter was cut short when Elder Zhenfu appeared and announced the next trial location was the Nine Heavens Secret Domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>N-Nine Heavens Secret Domain? Elder, are you serious?&rdquo; a braver junior stepped forward and asked, but she was so afraid that her voice quivered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Yes, it&rsquo;s the Nine Heavens Secret Domain,&rdquo; Elder Zhenfu replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was initially dazed, but their faces began to pale in horror when Elder Zhenfu verified the location. Through their reactions, Chu Feng realized that the Nine Heavens Secret Domain was not a good place to visit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Elder, are we going to the vicinity of the Nine Heavens Secret Domain? Or did the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion set up a formation in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain?&rdquo; someone asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>It looks like you have all heard about the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. I shan&rsquo;t beat around the bush then. The Nine Heavens Secret Domain is one of the few unexplored remnants in the world, but it&rsquo;s also the place that best showcases a world spiritist&rsquo;s capability. We&rsquo;ll be putting you on a route that we, from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, have walked before. Those who emerge from the remnant will be deemed to have cleared the remnant, and they will receive generous rewards even if they don&rsquo;t meet the criteria to join our ranks,&rdquo; Elder Zhenfu said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Elder, is it a newly-discovered route? Or is it the one Lord Jie Ranqing and the others have walked on?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>It&rsquo;s the one young miss Jie Ranqing has walked on,&rdquo; Elder Zhenfu replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Ah?&rdquo; The juniors&rsquo; complexions turned even more awful. </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Elder, may I&hellip; forfeit the combat exam?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Forfeit?&rdquo; Elder Zhenfu&rsquo;s face suddenly turned livid, and the atmosphere turned freezingly cold. </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>What kind of place do you take our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to be? To come and go as you please&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several silhouettes flitted forth to surround all of the juniors who had cleared the trial. They were elders from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The juniors further panicked, as they realized that the situation was heading in a direction contrary to what they had expected. What Elder Zhenfu said afterward drove them into despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Everyone who cleared the talent test has to participate in the combat exam. Anyone who dares to forfeit will be killed. Move!&rdquo; Elder Zhenfu waved his sleeves, and a flying warship appeared. </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Board the warship.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s elders urged the juniors to board the warship. In the process, some of the juniors burst into tears, both men and women alike. Some of their knees even caved in, and the elders had to support them onto the warship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warship started moving as soon as the juniors were onboard, and the cries grew even louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone even insisted that he be let off the warship, stating his background in hopes of intimidating the elders. His background might carry weight, but it was insignificant before the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. The elders simply bound him up with their spirit power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who dared kick a larger fuss were captured and dragged away. No one dared to cause any trouble afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng grew increasingly curious. He remained in a concealed state as he scanned the crowd to look for someone composed to gather information from. He set his eyes on a tall and brawny man, released his concealment, and walked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He settled down next to the brawny man and asked, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Brother, do you know what kind of place the Nine Heavens Secret Domain is? Why is everyone so afraid?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words were spoken politely, but the brawny man furiously glared at Chu Feng and roared, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Are you blind?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes turned cold. He was in a bad mood due to Eggy&rsquo;s situation, making him less tolerant of rudeness from others. Nevertheless, he held himself back and gave the other party a second chance, asking, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>I&rsquo;m only asking you about the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. Do you have to get so angry?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the other person said afterward baffled Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>I asked if you were blind because you called me brother. What does it have to do with you asking me about the Nine Heavens Secret Domain?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>What do you mean?&rdquo; Chu Feng was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Are you seriously asking me that? You must really be blind!&rdquo; Infuriated, the brawny man stood up and towered before Chu Feng like a hill. He pointed at Chu Feng and roared, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Who are you calling brother? Can&rsquo;t you tell I&rsquo;m a lady?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Ah&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng was rendered speechless. He really couldn&rsquo;t tell that the brawny man was a lady, be it in terms of appearance or voice. He quickly clasped his fist and apologized, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>You are a lady? My apologies.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>That&rsquo;s more like it. On the account that you&rsquo;re polite and willing to admit your </span><span>mistakes. I shall tell you about the Nine Heavens Secret Domain, though I have to ask&hellip; you are a world spiritist, right? Have you really never heard of the Nine Heavens Secret Domain?&rdquo; The brawny woman assessed Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>I&rsquo;m afraid not.&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, the brawny woman widened her eyes and asked, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>My gosh. It can&rsquo;t be that you&rsquo;re that Chu Feng, right? I know you! You are the person who received the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master&rsquo;s acknowledgment!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>News about Elder Zhenfu visiting Chu Feng under the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master&rsquo;s orders and enquiring what Saint-tier treasure he wanted had already spread like wildfire. There were even portraits of him circulating around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the reason Chu Feng had concealed himself. He didn&rsquo;t want to be disturbed by the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Chu Feng! It&rsquo;s Chu Feng!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was in a low mood and didn&rsquo;t notice Chu Feng, but the brawny woman&rsquo;s exclamation drew their attention. In the blink of an eye, countless people had already crowded around him. A few beautiful women even leaped right into his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Young master Chu Feng, may I travel with you? I&rsquo;m begging you, young master Chu Feng. Please take me with you!&rdquo; A woman wrapped her arms tightly around Chu Feng while pleading with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men, knowing that they were disadvantaged in terms of their gender, approached him with more sincere attitudes. Some even cast aside their dignity and kneeled down to Chu Feng and hugged his thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Big brother Chu Feng, young master Chu Feng, grandpa Chu Feng, please take me with you. I&rsquo;m willing to offer all of my properties to you if you take me with you!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Scram! He&rsquo;s talking to me. The rest of you are being a hindrance!&rdquo; a furious voice suddenly echoed as a surge of spirit power knocked away those crowding around Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the brawny woman&rsquo;s doing. She was a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Chu Feng, I am Xiao Yueyue. It&rsquo;s fate that you approached me, so why don&rsquo;t we travel together through the Nine Heavens Secret Domain?&rdquo; the brawny woman asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Xiao Yueyue? She&rsquo;s Xiao Yueyue? Could she be the Beastrealm Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s disciple?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was astonished. It would appear that the brawny woman was from a formidable background.</span></p></div>
