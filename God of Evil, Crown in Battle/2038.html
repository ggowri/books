        <div> - Moving Toward The Tiger&rsquo;s Mountain<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Rest assured, your family will definitely be saved. Do you know anything else?&rdquo; The Snow-haired Immortal asked.<br>&ldquo;Both the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace have joined the Dark Hall,&rdquo; After that, the old man spoke more about the Dark Hall. However, it was all information that Chu Feng and the others already knew.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; The Snow-haired Immortal asked with narrowed eyes.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s all I know,&rdquo; The old man nodded.<br>Hearing those words, a flash of coldness shone through the Snow-haired Immortal&rsquo;s eyes. She then smashed her palm forward with the intention of killing the old man.<br>&ldquo;Paaa~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before the Snow-haired Immortal&rsquo;s palm could land, Chu Feng grabbed her wrist. He said, &ldquo;Senior Snow-hair, we must keep our promise. Since he has already turned a new leaf, we should give him another chance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; The Snow-haired Immortal seemed to want to say something. However, in the end, she said nothing and only smiled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do as you say.&rdquo;<br>Had it been before, the Snow-haired Immortal would have definitely insisted on her own standpoint. She was vicious and merciless, and would definitely not keep her promise to forgive her enemy. Else, how could she have the reputation of a witch?<br>However, she now felt enormous admiration and respect for Chu Feng. Thus, she did not dare to refuse Chu Feng&rsquo;s suggestion.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, a golden light flew past. It was a Golden Flash Bird.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s His Majesty. He wants us to return immediately,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; The Snow-haired Immortal nodded.<br>After that, Chu Feng and the Snow-haired Immortal brought that old man with them and returned to the Elf Kingdom.<br>After Chu Feng finished settling the old man down, he hurried to the Elf King. Chu Feng felt that the Elf King must have something important to tell him.<br>After entering the Elf King&rsquo;s palace, Chu Feng discovered that the Elf King, the Four Grand Elders and Eight Great Protectors were all present. Even the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others were also present.<br>This caused Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind to tense up. These experts had originally all been stationed to guard various locations. Yet, they were now all gathered in the Elf Kingdom. Evidently, something had happened.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, Snow-haired Immortal, you two have returned at just the right time. I have good news,&rdquo; Seeing Chu Feng and the Snow-haired Immortal&rsquo;s return, the Elf King spoke with a smile, &ldquo;We have discovered the location of the Dark Hall&rsquo;s headquarters. We finally have the chance to eliminate them completely.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng and the Snow-haired Immortal looked to one another and started to frown. Then, Chu Feng asked, &ldquo;Did you obtain that information from the people of the Dark Hall?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, you already knew?&rdquo; The Elf King asked.<br>&ldquo;We also captured a person from the Dark Hall. He came here risking his life. As for his purpose, it was not to scout out information. Rather, he wanted to sacrifice himself to transmit news to us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, we removed the self-detonation formation on his body and removed his mask so that he could speak the truth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After he was able to speak the truth, we found out from him that the location of the Dark Hall&rsquo;s headquarters that they let us know about is actually a trap,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;So it really was a trap?&rdquo; Hearing what Chu Feng said, the crowd began to discuss it spiritedly.<br>It would appear that they had also managed to guess that it might be a trap set by the Dark Hall after obtaining that piece of information.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, even if that&rsquo;s the case, we must still go. This time around, we must willfully go towards the mountain even though we know that there are tigers in it,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;Since we know that a trap awaits us there, we must consider things carefully in advance. Else, if this is to lure us away, we will likely suffer disastrously,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I have already ordered all of our Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; elites that can be maneuvered to set out for the Dark Hall&rsquo;s headquarters together with me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;During the period of time that I am away, the Elf Kingdom will activate our Ancient Era&rsquo;s grand formation. Thus, nothing will happen to our Elf Kingdom in the short term,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;Then, what about the other Elf territories?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;As matters stand, we have no choice but to abandon some of them. We must settle this battle as quickly as possible,&rdquo; The Elf King said.<br>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng was still worried.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, that Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master resembles you greatly. Although he is not a peak Martial Emperor, he was able to fight against me. Do you know why that is the case?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He possessed the same lightning armor and lightning wings as you do. Furthermore&hellip; he also possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, although his actual cultivation is only that of a rank five Martial Emperor, he is able to fight against me, a rank nine Martial Emperor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should know how long I&rsquo;ve stayed a rank nine Martial Emperor. Even now, I am unable to break through into the Half Martial Ancestor realm. Likely, it will be impossible in the near future as well.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, what about him? Perhaps he might reach a breakthrough to rank six Martial Emperor in a short period of time. At that time, I will be no match for him. Even our Elf Kingdom&rsquo;s grand formation, as well as the grand formation you&rsquo;ve set up in the Cyanwood Mountain, would not be able to stop him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, only death would await us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, it&rsquo;s not that I do not wish to make sure that we will absolutely succeed by waiting to fight them after we have grasped an absolute certainty of victory.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rather, we truly do not have the time for that,&rdquo; The Elf King said with a serious expression.<br>Hearing what the Elf King said, Chu Feng grew silent. Indeed&hellip; the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master possessed the same sort of power Chu Feng did. Not only had he grasped all the techniques Chu Feng had, he also possessed the same sort of heaven-defying battle power as Chu Feng.<br>Being only a rank five Martial Emperor, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master possessed the same strength as a peak Martial Emperor. If he were to become a rank six Martial Emperor, he would obtain strength approaching that of a Half Martial Ancestor. At that time, it was likely that no one in the Holy Land of Martialism would be able to contend against him.<br>And, if he were to become a rank seven, rank eight or even a rank nine Martial Emperor? That would be something truly unimaginable.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, we have gone through careful deliberations in order to come to this decision. Apart from this, we have no alternatives.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is truly that we are too short on time, and our opponent is too powerful. As matters stand, we can only stake our all on this fight,&rdquo; Lord Lianghua said.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, then I will listen to Your Majesty&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; Seeing that the crowd was determined, Chu Feng could only nod and comply with their decision. After all, apart from this, he was unable to think of any better method either.<br>Although everyone was able to see that it might be a trap, this was the only way to defeat the Dark Hall that they could think of.<br>Thus, after the elite soldiers were gathered, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves led their elite army of Martial Emperors toward the headquarters of the Dark Hall.<br>The location of the Dark Hall&rsquo;s headquarters that they had spread was a very remote location. It was at a very desolate place in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>After traveling, they finally arrived at their destination. Furthermore, after searching, they managed to find the Dark Hall&rsquo;s headquarters.<br>Merely, it was completely different from what they had anticipated. The Dark Hall&rsquo;s army and the countless Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts were all present before their line of sight.<br>There were slaughtering formations placed all over their various camps. It was as if they were already prepared, and were just waiting for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; army and the stone army to reach this place so that they could battle them.<br><br></p></div>
