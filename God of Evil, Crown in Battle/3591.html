        <h1>Chapter 3590</h1>
        <div> - Breaking Through To Utmost Exalted<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside the Sacred Palace Hall, Chu Feng was sitting on the Sacred Tree Throne.<br>After Chu Feng ascended to the Sacred Tree Throne, a seed-like item made its way into his dantian.<br>That seed was currently at the same location as the nine enormous lightning beasts.<br>That seed was not an ordinary item. Not only was its surface completely filled with vein lines, but it also contained an extraordinary amount of natural energies.<br>Chu Feng made several attempts to refine the seed. However, ultimately, he concluded that he would not be able to refine the seed with only his power.<br>&ldquo;Never would I imagine that the Sacred Tree Seed would be this difficult to refine.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng also felt rather helpless. As someone who had controlled the Sacred Tree&rsquo;s power before, he knew about the Sacred Tree Seed, and knew that it was a cultivation treasure.<br>The Sacred Tree Seed was known to be a cultivation treasure that was very difficult to subdue.<br>However, for some unknown reason, Chu Feng simply did not have to undergo the process of subduing it.<br>The moment he ascended to the Sacred Tree Throne, the Sacred Tree Seed directly entered his body. It was as if it had recognized him.<br>Chu Feng was able to obtain the Sacred Tree Seed exceptionally smoothly, so much so that he felt disbelief.<br>At that instant, Chu Feng was simply overjoyed. He had thought that he would be able to advance by leaps and bounds.<br>Merely, never did Chu Feng expect that, although he managed to obtain the Sacred Tree Seed, he was unable to refine it at all.<br>Even though he knew that the Sacred Tree Seed contained an enormous amount of natural energies and martial comprehension, he was unable to gain any of it.<br>However, who was Chu Feng? He was someone with abundant perseverance and patience.<br>Thus, he did not give up at all. Instead, he was meticulously studying and pondering what sort of method would be able to refine the Sacred Tree Seed. He was also trying to decipher the symbols on the seed in the hopes of being able to obtain some martial comprehension.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>However, whilst Chu Feng was still thinking, the palace hall started to tremble violently.<br>Furthermore, the trembling showed no signs of stopping. Instead, it was growing more and more intense. Even they, martial cultivators, were being majorly affected by the trembling.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>Such intense trembling engulfed the entire Sacred Palace Hall. Not only was Chu Feng&rsquo;s attention aroused, but Tantai Yinjian, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and all the others that were in focused training were all roused by the trembling.<br>&ldquo;Crack~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Crack~~~&rdquo;<br>Following that, cracks began to appear on the stone chairs.<br>When the cracks appeared, not only did the stone chairs&rsquo; natural energies visible to the naked eye began to dissipate, even the natural energies within the Sacred Palace Hall began to dissipate.<br>Seeing that the stone chairs had lost their effectiveness, Tantai Yinjian, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and everyone else all flew down from them.<br>&ldquo;Lord Tantai, what is going on here?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd had all arrived beside Tantai Yinjian.<br>Even though both Tantai Yinjian and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief were peak Exalted-level experts, even though it was due to Chu Feng that the crowd were able to enter the sacred had, the crowd would always first seek help from Tantai Yinjian every time, due to his status.<br>There was no need to doubt that Tantai Yinjian was the actual pillar in their hearts.<br>Unfortunately, Tantai Yinjian himself was also completely bewildered by the scene before them.<br>&ldquo;The time is almost here.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice was suddenly heard. Following that, a figure flew down from a stone chair and landed before the crowd.<br>It was the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief!!!<br>&ldquo;This aura?!!!&rdquo;<br>After the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief appeared, the expressions of the crowd all changed greatly.<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen revealed ecstatic expressions. As for the remainder of the crowd, their faces turned ugly.<br>The reason for that was because an overwhelming power was being released from the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief the instant he landed. That aura covered the entire Sacred Palace Hall.<br>Enveloped by that aura, the crowd felt as if they&rsquo;d been enveloped by death itself.<br>It was a power so strong that they were unable to contend against it. Even Tantai Yinjian revealed fear and unease in his eyes.<br>Utmost Exalted. At that moment, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was emitting the aura of a rank one Utmost Exalted.<br>He&hellip; had made a breakthrough!!!<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, congratulations on breaking through to Utmost Exalted!!!&rdquo;<br>A burst of congratulating voices sounded. It was the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen. They had uniformly knelt on the ground.<br>Even without the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen&rsquo;s congratulations, the crowd had suspected that it might be the case.<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had managed to successfully make a breakthrough on that stone chair.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Scared?&rdquo;<br>With a beaming smile on his face, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief ran his eyes over the crowd.<br>Scared. Of course they were scared. When they were all peak Exalted, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief could still be contained by Tantai Yinjian and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>But at that moment, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had successfully made a breakthrough to Utmost Exalted.<br>Tantai Yinjian and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, on the other hand, were clearly still only peak Exalted.<br>Although it was only a fine line of difference, there was a heaven and earth difference in the power they possessed.<br>Utmost Exalteds were paramount existences in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield. They were not people that Exalteds could compare to.<br>This was even more the case when the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had such a strange expression in his eyes. Because of that, the crowd felt even more uneasy.<br>&ldquo;Lord Tantai,&rdquo; in a panic, the crowd turned their gazes to their pillar, Tantai Yinjian.<br>&ldquo;Blood-devouring Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, we are currently allies. Could it be&hellip; you plan to destroy this relationship?&rdquo; asked Tantai Yinjian.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So much for allies. If the person who made a breakthrough this time was you, would you abide by this so-called alliance?&rdquo; asked the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Before Tantai Yinjian could reply, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief shouted loudly.<br>&ldquo;Kneel!!!&rdquo;<br>Then, boundless oppressive might appeared out of the blue.<br>At that moment, apart from the Chu Heavenly Clansmen and the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen, everyone else was forced to uniformly kneel on the ground by the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;Blood-devouring Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, this is inappropriate, no?&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, of the people present, only your Chu Heavenly Clan has managed to obtain this old man&rsquo;s respect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, this respect was not obtained by you. Thus&hellip; you&rsquo;d best not interfere. Otherwise&hellip; your Chu Heavenly Clan will suffer a calamity too,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Hearing those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief furrowed his brows. He knew that the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was not joking around.<br>&ldquo;As for you all, bunch of vile characters, you will only waste natural energies by living. Thus, it's better that you pay for the crimes committed by your ancestors.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief unleashed his killing intent.<br>Sensing that intense killing intent, the crowd all felt their hearts tighten. They felt that a great catastrophe was imminent.<br>&ldquo;Senior, are you planning to have a complete falling-out?&rdquo;<br>To the crowd&rsquo;s surprise, such a question was raised at such a time.<br>It was Chu Feng!!!<br></p></div>
