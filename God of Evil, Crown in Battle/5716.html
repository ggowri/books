        <h1>Chapter 5716: Hurry Up, Elder</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; Long Lin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Long Lin, bad news!&rdquo; Taishi Xingzhong entered the palace and kneeled on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He proceeded to tell Long Lin about how Chu Feng had come with a powerful cultivator to kidnap his son. He deduced that the powerful cultivator was a pinnacle True God level cultivator, or else the latter wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to easily take Chu Feng away under his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did Taishi Xingzhong know that the &lsquo;powerful cultivator&rsquo; he was referring to was Long Lin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is it the Chu Feng who caused a fuss in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?&rdquo; Long Lin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him, Lord Long Lin,&rdquo; Taishi Xingzhong said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He was able to safely retreat after wreaking havoc in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, It&rsquo;s only normal that he has a powerful cultivator behind him. What&rsquo;s there to make a fuss about?&rdquo; Long Lin replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Long Lin, that child is on close terms with Long Chengyu and Long Muxi. He must be here to save them,&rdquo; Taishi Xingzhong said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, he can&rsquo;t possibly save them,&rdquo; Long Lin replied as he rose to his feet, ready to take his leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Milord, that child is a scheming one. You mustn&rsquo;t let your guard down. We should&hellip;&rdquo; Taishi Xingzhong still wanted to persuade Long Lin, but he was immediately shocked into silence when the latter&rsquo;s eyes suddenly turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Taishi Xingzhong, I know that you&rsquo;re worried about your son, but it&rsquo;s your fault for failing to protect your own son. Deal with this matter as you deem fit,&rdquo; Long Lin said before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taishi Xingzhong dared not to say anything. He was nowhere as composed as when he first met Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng had been hard at work after Long Lin left. As the latter didn&rsquo;t close the gate, he was still able to see Long Chengyu and the others, so he spent his time trying to figure out a way to open the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the gate was no ordinary spirit formation gate. He was unable to open it, breach it, or even communicate with Long Chengyu and the others over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This frustrated Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t trust Long Lin, and the converse was likely true too. Otherwise, Long Lin wouldn&rsquo;t have disallowed him from coming into contact with Long Chengyu and the others. Thus, it&rsquo;d be for the best if he could save Long Chengyu and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Calm down, young friend Chu Feng. I&rsquo;ll let you meet them if you help me refine the dragon essence,&rdquo; Long Lin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was taken aback. He had to concede that pinnacle True God level cultivators were formidable. Despite his sharp senses, Long Lin was still able to appear behind him without him knowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, when did you get here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I just got back,&rdquo; Long Lin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a grand wave of his sleeves, he took out four items&mdash;a scroll, a pearl, a box, and a bottle. He proceeded to introduce them one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the box was a treasure that was to be fused into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. It would disguise him as a possessor of the Dragon Bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pearl was a treasure containing a formation that would complete the disguise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And within the bottle was the dragon essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;As for this&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Lin unfurled the scroll, and a blinding light burst out from within. Six huge words were written on the scroll:</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rank One God Taboo: Dragon Breath</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, does fusing the dragon essence require a God Taboo Martial Skill?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course not. I know you&rsquo;re helping me in view of our past relationship, and for me to return your friends their freedom and restore the Totem Dragon Clan to how it was. Still, I can&rsquo;t let you do this favor for me in vain. This God Taboo Martial Skill is my </span><span>way of compensating you,&rdquo; Long Lin said as he passed the scroll to Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, that is a treasure from the Totem Dragon Clan, right? Is it fine for you to give it to me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I am the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. As long as I&rsquo;m in charge, none of my subordinates will make things difficult for you.&rdquo; Long Lin then pointed at Long Chengyu and the others and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to think that they won&rsquo;t make things difficult for you either. If they can&rsquo;t stand the notion of you practicing our Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s God Taboo&hellip; perhaps it&rsquo;s about time for you to sever your ties with them?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, elder. I shall humbly accept your gift,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he accepted the scroll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God Taboo Martial Skills were incredibly valuable. To date, Chu Feng still hadn&rsquo;t cultivated a God Taboo Martial Skill before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s your current cultivation level? I&rsquo;m talking about your base cultivation level,&rdquo; Long Lin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Rank three Half-God level,&rdquo; Chu Feng said</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do. You should only practice it after you reach rank five Half-God level, or else there&rsquo;s a high chance you&rsquo;ll suffer a backlash,&rdquo; Long Lin advised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I understand. I&rsquo;ll take note of it,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he stowed away the scroll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, can we begin now?&rdquo; Long Lin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Lin crushed the bead and unleashed the formation within. He then opened the box, and a soul entity harnessing the Dragon Bloodline floated out. Using the formation with a medium, the soul entity began fusing with Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you feel any discomfort?&rdquo; Long Lin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. Let&rsquo;s continue,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disguised Dragon Bloodline was being fused into Chu Feng&rsquo;s soul, after all. Discomfort was an understatement here. Ordinary people wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to withstand it, but Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t an ordinary person. He had tempered his willpower to the extreme, which was why the compass chose him in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that, Long Lin opened the bottle, and a blinding golden light rushed into the sky. Following that, a golden fluid flowed out. The world shook, as the golden fluid emanated an incomparably fierce aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is that a real god beast? Even the dragon essence it left behind after its death is so powerful,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked, though he quickly remembered that the imprint on his robe&rsquo;s chest was a god beast too. Thus, he turned to the Heaven-devouring Qilin and asked, &ldquo;Why is there such a huge difference between the two of you even though you&rsquo;re a god beast too?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What nonsense are you spouting, Little Feng? This is nothing at all! As long as you obediently follow my words, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before I reveal my true strength to you. Be ready to drop your lower jaws then!&rdquo; the Heaven-devouring Qilin exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be looking forward to that day then,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his focus to the dragon essence, activating his Heaven&rsquo;s Eye to examine it. </span><span>After confirming that there was nothing wrong with the dragon essence, he said, &ldquo;Elder, let&rsquo;s begin.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Bear with it, young friend Chu Feng. Let me know if you&rsquo;re unable to withstand it,&rdquo; Long Lin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Mmhm,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon receiving Chu Feng&rsquo;s permission, Long Lin channeled the dragon essence to flow into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wu!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Chu Feng was prepared, he gritted his teeth the moment the dragon essence flowed into his body. Great pain gripped his soul, spreading across his entire body. Long Lin wasn&rsquo;t joking when he said that the dragon essence&rsquo;s energy was violent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rather than refining the dragon essence&rsquo;s energy, this felt more like torture instead. There was even a risk of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How is it, Chu Feng? Are you able to hold on?&rdquo; Long Lin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Lin continued channeling the dragon essence into the disguised Dragon Bloodline within Chu Feng&rsquo;s soul, but he did it slowly out of fear that Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t be able to withstand it. This was not the first time he had done this, so he knew how dangerous this process was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one else before Chu Feng was able to withstand the dragon essence, including him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not just about their willpower here. They would really lose their lives if they forced themselves to hold on. He was initially worried as to whether Chu Feng could withstand the dragon essence&rsquo;s energy, but he was starting to believe that Chu Feng was extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Things might just work out this time around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then that Chu Feng said, &ldquo;Elder, hurry up.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Lin&rsquo;s eyes nearly bulged out from surprise.</span></p></div>
