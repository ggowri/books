        <h1>Chapter 3763</h1>
        <div> - The Disapproved Overlord<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;City Master Long, please tell us who that person is.&rdquo;<br>The crowd spoke in succession after Long Daozhi&rsquo;s words left his mouth. They all wanted to know who he would recommend to become the new overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>&ldquo;I feel that the person in the Ancestral Martial Starfield that is most capable of managing it would be the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi turned his gaze to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief as he said those words.<br>&ldquo;Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief?&rdquo;<br>The crowd&rsquo;s gazes followed Long Daozhi. Upon confirming that the person Long Daozhi was speaking of was indeed the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, they immediately burst into a complete uproar.<br>If the Three Cities were to refuse to assume control over the Ancestral Martial Starfield, it would normally mean that the new overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield would be determined by strength.<br>With that, it would be Gu Mingyuan who was most qualified to assume that position. Although she was a rank one Utmost Exalted, she was capable of increasing her cultivation to rank two Utmost Exalted through her bloodline&rsquo;s power. Her strength was truly powerful. It could be said that after the Linghu Heavenly Clan left, apart from the Three Cities, no one in the Ancestral Martial Starfield would be able to rival her.<br>Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s only shortcoming was her excessively fiery temper. If she were to become the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s overlord, she would definitely be a tyrant.<br>However, even if Gu Mingyuan was a no-go, there was still the Tantai Heavenly Clan and the Jiaoli Heavenly Clan.<br>No matter what, it wouldn&rsquo;t be the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s turn.<br>Ignoring the fact that the Chu Heavenly Clan had a very low status in the Ancestral Martial Starfield to begin with, their clan chief was only a peak Exalted.<br>Although peak Exalted was only a step away from Utmost Exalted, there was an enormous difference between them.<br>In the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the number of Utmost Exalted-level experts could be counted with one&rsquo;s fingers. But, the number of peak Exalted were much more numerous.<br>To be the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, one should at least be an Utmost Exalted. How could one be qualified to be the overlord with only the cultivation of a peak Exalted?<br>Thus, at that moment, the crowd began to spiritedly discuss the matter. Some people even bluntly declared Long Daozhi&rsquo;s recommendation to be completely absurd.<br>Hearing the discussions all around, Long Daozhi&rsquo;s expression suddenly grew gloomy.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? It seems like everyone is disapproving of my suggestion?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who does not agree with me? Why do you not agree with my suggestion? Why don&rsquo;t you say it out loud?&rdquo;<br>His words were not spoken very resoundingly. There was also no trace of anger in his voice.<br>However, his expression was extremely gloomy as he said those words.<br>Because of that, the crowd knew that he was displeased.<br>Thus, the crowd that were voicing their rejections nonstop earlier all shut their mouths.<br>Although they were disapproving of the Chu Heavenly Clan, they did not dare to offend Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;City Master Long, I thank you for your high regard of this old man. Unfortunately, this old man&rsquo;s strength is truly limited. I am truly unable to take on such a heavy responsibility,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said with his fist clasped.<br>He was not acting courteous. Rather, he truly felt that he was incapable of shouldering such a heavy responsibility.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Chu, I said you&rsquo;re capable, so you&rsquo;re most definitely capable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;From today on, your Chu Heavenly Clan shall be the new master of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My Ancestral Martial Dragon City will become your support. If anyone is unconvinced, or if anyone dares to show any disrespect towards your Chu Heavenly Clan, my Ancestral Martial Dragon City will definitely not spare them,&rdquo; said Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Chu, my Monstrous Holy City will also stand beside you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The same goes for my Divine Body Royal City.&rdquo;<br>The Monstrous Holy City&rsquo;s City Master and the Divine Body Royal City&rsquo;s City Master also added their support.<br>Not only that, they even stood beside the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief as they said those words.<br>They had made their position very clear. Although their Three Cities would not involve themselves with the matters of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, they were going to support the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Our Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan also endorses the Chu Heavenly Clan in becoming the new master of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan is an ally of the Chu Heavenly Clan. If anyone dares disrespect the Chu Heavenly Clan, they will be disrespecting our Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan. I believe everyone present knows what sort of temper I, Gu Mingyuan, possesses.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I hope that you all do not provoke me. My anger with the Linghu Heavenly Clan is still present. If you want to bring forth that resentment upon yourselves, do not blame me, Gu Mingyuan, for becoming unreasonable.&rdquo;<br>Gu Mingyuan also spoke. Compared to the tactful behavior displayed by the three City Masters, she was much more direct, and openly threatened the crowd.<br>The crowd looked at each other in dismay. No matter how unwilling they were, they did not dare to utter a single word of disapproval.<br>Whilst it was true that the Chu Heavenly Clan was incapable of becoming the overlord, as both their clan and their clan chief were not approved by the crowd - the only person the crowd approved of was Chu Feng, who was still a person of the younger generation - but Ancestral Martial Dragon City, Monstrous Holy City, Divine Body Royal City and the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan were all powers recognized by the crowd.<br>Any one of those four powers were existences that no one would dare to provoke. And all four of them stood beside the Chu Heavenly Clan. No matter how much the crowd disapproved of the Chu Heavenly Clan, they could only endure it.<br>Whilst they might not be afraid of the Chu Heavenly Clan, they were deeply afraid of the four powers behind it.<br>&ldquo;I pay my respects to the Starfield Master.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, someone half-kneeled and bowed respectfully to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>When the crowd saw that person half-kneeling, they were all surprised.<br>The reason for that was because that half-kneeling individual was Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t mess around.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng actually addressed him as the Starfield Master, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, who was unwilling to take on such a heavy responsibility from the start, immediately waved his hand to indicate for Chu Feng to stand back up.<br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to the Starfield Master.&rdquo;<br>However, to his surprise, in the next instant, voices akin to rolling thunder resonated in unison.<br>All of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen half-kneeled as well.<br>Following them, the other powers present also began to half-kneel in succession.<br>Even the Tantai Heavenly Clan and the Jiaoli Heavenly Clan, both powers that had Utmost Exalted-level experts leading them, half-kneeled.<br>Furthermore, the ones that kneeled first were the two Utmost Exalted-level clan chiefs of the two Heavenly Clans.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s face was filled with complicated emotions.<br>He found the current situation difficult to accept. He had never ever imagined that, one day, powers all over the Ancestral Martial Starfield would bow to him.<br>Starfield Master?<br>That was a title that he never dared dream about.<br>Yet, at that moment, that title was actually his.<br>At the moment when the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was feeling like he was dreaming and was completely baffled by the scene before him, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen all had looks of unconcealable excitement.<br>Like their clan chief, they too had never imagined such a day.<br>Yet, what they&rsquo;d never dared imagine had actually occurred.<br>Their Chu Heavenly Clan, a power that was not recognized by others, a power looked down upon by others, suddenly became the power that all the various powers in the Ancestral Martial Starfield swore allegiance to. They would soon become the rulers of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>This was truly akin to a dream to them. However, this dream had come true. Naturally, they would be extremely excited.<br>Even though they knew that there were still many powers that did not approve of them from the bottom of their hearts, they were still extremely joyous to be able to gain such a title.<br>That said, at the same time as they were feeling joyous, many Chu Heavenly Clansmen were unable to keep themselves from looking over to Chu Feng.<br>They knew very well that it was actually not because of their Lord Clan Chief that they had gained the support of the four great powers. Instead, it was all due to Chu Feng.<br>They, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and even the outsiders were all very certain of this.<br>All of them knew that it was all due to Chu Feng that the Chu Heavenly Clan was able to obtain their current status.<br>Being the focus of the crowd, although Chu Feng also had an excited and joyous smile on his face, he actually felt an enormous boulder crushing down on his chest.<br>Chu Feng knew that the Chu Heavenly Clan becoming the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield was a good thing.<br>However, it would also be an enormous challenge. In fact, it could be said to be an unprecedented challenge.<br>The reason why Chu Feng felt it to be a difficult challenge was not because the various powers in the Ancestral Martial Starfield were disapproving of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Instead, it was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s ambition was no longer limited to the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br></p></div>
