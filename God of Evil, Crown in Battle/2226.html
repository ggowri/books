        <div> - Displaying One&rsquo;s Ability for the First Time<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Young friend, go ahead and continue,&rdquo; Daoist Three Swords said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This purple fog is extremely hard to deal with. Likely, it will be impossible for any of us to break through it alone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am capable of setting up a spirit formation. However, I will need the assistance of everyone&rsquo;s power in order to break through that fog,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What arrogance. You will set up the formation, yet will need our power? What makes you think you&rsquo;re qualified to do that?&rdquo; Sure enough, the Four World Spiritist Emperors spoke again. Furthermore, their words were filled with disdain.<br>In fact, it was not only the Four World Spiritist Emperors that were looking down upon Chu Feng. Many of the world spiritists present were lightly laughing at Chu Feng with mocking laughter.<br>Like the Four World Spiritist Emperors, they were also looking down on Chu Feng. They felt that Chu Feng was nothing more than a beam jumping clown, and possessed no qualifications to order them around.<br>&ldquo;What makes him qualified? He&rsquo;s qualified because he is no ordinary Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist,&rdquo; Right at that moment, Liu Xiaoli spoke. Furthermore, when she spoke those words, she actually revealed a trace of anger.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart was moved upon seeing that sight. He knew that Liu Xiaoli was not someone who was fond of publicity, nor was she someone fond of stirring up troubles.<br>On the contrary, she was a very conservative individual. Logically, in such a situation, she should be keeping a low profile.<br>However, she did not. She did it for his sake.<br>Liu Xiaoli was standing up for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What a joke. A little brat pretending to be a know-it-all is not enough, turns out there&rsquo;s another assistant.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well then. Tell me, if he is not an ordinary Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, what is he?&rdquo; The eldest Four World Spiritist Emperor asked mockingly.<br>&ldquo;He is an Asura World Spiritist,&rdquo; Liu Xiaoli spoke those words one word at a time.<br>The moment the words &lsquo;Asura World Spiritist&rsquo; was heard, the crowd grew completely quiet. It was an absolute silence. Everyone stood there as if they were petrified.<br>After a moment of silence, someone asked, &ldquo;Asura World Spiritist? You say that he&rsquo;s an Asura World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since when were there so many Asura World Spiritists? There&rsquo;re actually so many Asura World Spiritists now that even a random brat can declare himself to be an Asura World Spiritist,&rdquo; The Four World Spiritist Emperors said mockingly. They simply did not believe that Chu Feng was an Asura World Spiritist.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, prove it to them, and let them know how powerful you are,&rdquo; Liu Xiaoli said to Chu Feng. She was truly unable to contain her anger. She was furious at how an exceptional talent like Chu Feng would be held in contempt by a bunch of old farts.<br>&ldquo;Originally, I did not intend to prove anything. I merely wanted to join hands with everyone and break through that purple fog.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if I must prove myself in order to obtain everyone's assistance, then I do not mind proving myself either.&rdquo;<br>Right after Chu Feng finished saying those words, he opened his world spirit gate. Then, a boundless amount of dark black gaseous flames swept forth from that world spirit gate.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>After the black gaseous flames appeared, a violent wind immediately started to blow in that region. Ghost-like wails and wolf-like howls were sounding nonstop.<br>&ldquo;This sensation!? How could it be this frightening?!&rdquo; The expressions of many of the people present changed upon sensing the black gaseous flames.<br>Even Grandmaster Pocket and Daoist Three Swords, who had experienced grand spectacles, had a change in expression.<br>The reason for that was because the crowd felt a killing intent they&rsquo;d never felt before from the black gaseous flames. That killing intent simply did not resemble something a human was capable of unleashing. That killing intent caused even their souls to shiver.<br>&ldquo;Excellent, excellent. It is truly a blessing to our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm for an Asura World Spiritist to appear here,&rdquo; Grandmaster Pocket said with a beaming smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Pocket, in that case, he really is an Asura World Spiritist?&rdquo; The crowd all revealed astonished gazes.<br>&ldquo;That unrivalled sensation is definitely one of an Asura World Spiritist,&rdquo; Before Grandmaster Pocket could answer, Daoist Three Swords said. Furthermore, he even took the initiative to walk to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side and ask him courteously, &ldquo;Young friend, are you called Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, junior is indeed called Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied courteously.<br>At that moment, he had closed his world spirit gate. He had not made Her Lady Queen show herself.<br>After all, there were knowledgeable individuals here. It would suffice should he let them know that he was an Asura World Spiritist.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, go ahead and set up your spirit formation. Regardless of whether or not others will support you, I will definitely support you,&rdquo; Daoist Three Swords patted his chest. It could be seen that he was a man of character.<br>However, one thing was without a doubt; after he verified that Chu Feng was an Asura World Spiritist, his attitude toward him became much more enthusiastic.<br>&ldquo;Amitabha, this old monk is also willing to support almsgiver Chu Feng,&rdquo; Grandmaster Pocket said.<br>Chu Feng smiled courteously at his two supporters. He knew that many more people would be willing to support him after those two men decided to support him.<br>&ldquo;Humph, I refuse to believe that brat will be able to set up any heaven-defying spirit formation,&rdquo; The Four World Spiritist Emperors continued to scoff at Chu Feng. They did not have a whole new level of respect for him just because he was an Asura World Spiritist.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng began to set up his spirit formation. Once he began to reveal his fluid and rapid motions in setting up his world spirit formation, the expressions of the crowd changed immediately.<br>Even the Four World Spiritist Emperors revealed astonished expressions.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s methods in setting up his spirit formation were truly at the apex of the Royal-cloak World Spiritist level.<br>As the saying goes, once an expert unleashes his talent, people will know whether or not he is a true expert immediately. After Chu Feng unleashed his techniques, the doubt the crowd held toward him disappeared instantly.<br>It was instead replaced with a whole new level of respect.<br>&ldquo;Expert. He is an actual world spiritist expert,&rdquo; Someone was unable to contain himself from commending Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Amazing. As expected of an Asura World Spiritist. It would appear that we have truly failed to recognize Mount Tai today.&rdquo;<br>Following that, more and more people began to express their admiration for Chu Feng. Those people that had looked down on Chu Feng earlier revealed expressions of shame.<br>The techniques Chu Feng used to set up his spirit formation were things that many people present were incapable of accomplishing.<br>He was a true master!!!<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Finally, light flourished; Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation was completed.<br>At that moment, many people were unable to contain themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.<br>Merely by looking at that spirit formation, they were able to tell that it was very powerful. Most importantly, Chu Feng had finished setting up that spirit formation in such a short period of time.<br>As for that, it greatly manifested how masterful in world spirit techniques Chu Feng was.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, I am unable to break this fog by myself. I will need everyone&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone, you all merely need to pour your world spirit power into this formation to help me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course&hellip; the greater the amount of world spirit power, the better. Thus, I hope that seniors will not be too stingy with your world spirit power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After a sufficient amount of spirit power is gathered, I will then activate this spirit formation to break through that purple fog,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Chu Feng finished saying those words, two boundless streams of spirit power began to pour into Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation like two golden dragons.<br>It was Grandmaster Pocket and Daoist Three Swords. The two of them kept their promise, and took the initiative to support Chu Feng. They began to steadily pour spirit power into Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation.<br>Following them, Liu Xiaoli, Elder Ning Shuang and Li Rui also began to pour their spirit power into Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, I&rsquo;ll trust you.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a world spiritist from the Zhou Heavenly Clan spoke. Although his reputation was not as grand as Grandmaster Pocket and Daoist Three Swords&rsquo;, he remained a very famous world spiritist.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll also trust you!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...<br>Following that, the other people present also began to pour their spirit power into Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation.<br>With the increase in the amount of people, the spirit power in the spirit formation began to surge violently.<br>That change caused the crowd to firmly believe that Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation was no small matter. In the end, apart from the Four World Spiritist Emperors, all of the people present poured their spirit power into Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation.<br>Even the world spiritists that arrived later and did not know what had happened joined in pouring their spirit power into Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation without the slightest hesitation the moment they found out what was happening.<br>However, the Four World Spiritist Emperors were still not joining.<br><br></p></div>
