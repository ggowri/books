        <h1>Chapter 5601: The Legendary Nine Realms Immortal Region</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of the clansmen had risen into the air to look at the distant phenomenon. The more they stared at it, the more shocked they appeared. Many of them rubbed their eyes in </span><span>disbelief, thinking it would change what they saw. Some of them even slapped themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were doubting what they were seeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, could that be the legendary&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd looked at the old man with excited looks. At this moment, they even forgot about the fear they previously felt due to Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That looks like it&hellip; Heaven is not blind! To think that I can witness this legend in my lifetime! I haven&rsquo;t lived my life in vain,&rdquo; the old man exclaimed in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What legend are you referring to?&rdquo; a voice suddenly echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man and the others slowly turned over upon hearing that voice, as fear filled their faces once more. Indeed, the one who had just spoken was none other than the man who had just threatened them&mdash;Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man and the others nearly spewed blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Milord, we didn&rsquo;t bully Hai&rsquo;er and Qiang&rsquo;er!&rdquo; the old man exclaimed as he dropped to his knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other clansmen did the same too. Despite their initial scorn toward Chu Feng, they were now so afraid of him that one would have thought that he was a demon from hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I know. I said I&rsquo;m a busybody earlier; I lingered around the area to watch a bit,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a brilliant smile, though his smile looked sinister to the old man and his clansmen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he spying on us?! Thank god that we didn&rsquo;t try anything, or else we&rsquo;d have been dead by now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Milord, it&rsquo;s good that you saw it. I earnestly intended to&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man intended to claim credit for his earlier show of repentance, but Chu Feng nonchalantly waved his hand and said, &ldquo;Enough. What can a single order prove? You need to sustain it in the long run. What I want to know now is that phenomenon over there. What&rsquo;s the legend you spoke about?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing that Chu Feng was here for something else. He wiped off his cold sweat and began explaining the legend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The legend could be traced to the era when this starfield was ruled by the Fighting Ape Clan. Back then, the Immortal Stream Upper Realm wasn&rsquo;t open to outsiders, as it was a forbidden land occupied by the Fighting Ape Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immortal Stream Upper Realm had a river known as the Immortal Stream, which was a glowing stream emanating an alluring fragrance that had the mystical effect of tempering one&rsquo;s body. This was an asset to not just cultivators but world spiritists too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only downside was that the Immortal Stream&rsquo;s water couldn&rsquo;t be taken away&mdash;one had to physically enter the Immortal Stream in order to enjoy its tempering effect. This held true for the Fighting Ape Clansmen too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was for that reason the Fighting Ape Clan sealed off the Immortal Stream Upper Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Fighting Ape Clan had friends all over the galaxies, so the Fighting Ape Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would occasionally invite his friends to bring their juniors to Immortal Stream Upper Realm to enjoy the Immortal Stream&rsquo;s tempering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At one point, they invited an exceptionally powerful world spiritist over to Immortal Stream Upper Realm. The latter was an enigmatic person&mdash;no one knew his identity or his looks. However, his means were not to be made light of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world spiritist said that the energy in the Immortal Stream was limited. The more people underwent tempering in it, the less energy the Immortal Stream had to offer. It was only a matter of time before the tempering effect of the Immortal Stream ceased to exist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also mentioned that the Immortal Stream was a gift from heaven, and the Fighting Ape Clan should share it with everyone else, though those who were capable ought to take priority. Thus, he proposed constructing a barrier around the Immortal Stream that would open every now and then. Those who wished to cultivate in the Immortal Stream would have to prove themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fighting Ape Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was a hearty person, so he accepted the suggestion on the spot. He declared that he would open up the Immortal Stream to the public if the world spiritist had the capability to turn the Immortal Stream into a formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Much to everyone&rsquo;s shock, the world spiritist gathered the power of the Immortal Stream and constructed a formation out of it. The Fighting Ape Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was taken aback, but he had no choice but to accept the outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The formation was constructed in the likeness of the world of cultivation; it was divided into nine regions, with eight of them being entrances and the centermost one being a cultivation region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eight entrances were represented by Ancestral Martial Galaxy, Nine Souls Galaxy, Seven Realms Galaxy, Bloodline Galaxy, Heavenly Dome Galaxy, Divine Body Galaxy, Immortal Sea Galaxy, and the Totem Dragon Galaxy. The centermost cultivation region was represented by the Ninth Galaxy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This formation was known as the Nine Realms Immortal Region. It was able to tap into the energy in the Immortal Stream, but more than that, it could distinguish the birthplace of those born in the eight galaxies. That was why it had eight entrances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entrances had to be opened by the juniors of the respective galaxy, and only then could the other cultivators from that galaxy access the Nine Realms Immortal Region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the juniors of a galaxy couldn&rsquo;t open their respective entrance, it would only mean that their galaxy was lacking in talented individuals, so their cultivators were unqualified to enter the Nine Realms Immortal Region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time the Nine Realms Immortal Region opened, it would draw the attention of powerhouses from all eight galaxies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, those powerhouses weren&rsquo;t after the tempering. Back in that era, there was no lack of treasures from the Ancient Era, and there were plenty of cultivation resources available. No matter how good the Immortal Stream was, it didn&rsquo;t justify the powerhouses traveling all the way over for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they wanted was to prove themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The galaxy to open their entrance to enter the Nine Realms Immortal Region would be able to hold their heads high before the others. It was the glory that the powerhouses were after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just that the interval between each opening of the Nine Realms Immortal Region gradually grew longer, to the point where it seemed to have stopped opening altogether. The last time it opened, the Fighting Ape Clan was still around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been countless years since then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While there were historical records proving that the Nine Realms Immortal Region had existed at one point in time, it had become nothing more than a legend in the present day. Even natives of the Immortal Stream Upper Realm had never seen the Immortal Stream before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, countless figures flitted across the sky. All of them were making their way toward the Nine Realms Immortal Region, hoping to see the legendary Immortal Stream in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Milord, may we head over?&rdquo; the old man asked Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course, but I have a question. Do you know who&rsquo;s the world spiritist who created the Nine Realms Immortal Region?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on what he had heard thus far, the Fighting Ape Clan should have been at their peak back then, and Little Fishy had told him that the Fighting Ape Clan was powerful enough to dominate a galaxy on their own back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the world spiritist who created the Nine Realms Immortal Region accomplished something that the Fighting Ape Clan couldn&rsquo;t. This indirectly showed how powerful the world spiritist was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;No one knows the world spiritist&rsquo;s identity. He&rsquo;s an enigmatic figure in the records, dressed in white robes and wearing a mask that conceals his facial features. He carries a sword with him, but no one has seen him ever drawing his sword before. There were some who speculated that his sword sheath is made out of dragonskin,&rdquo; the old man said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Dragonskin sword sheath? White robes? That description sounds awfully alike to Chaotic Era Scholar. The Nine Realms Immortal Region has disappeared for so long that it has become no more than a legend, only to suddenly reappear here now. This can&rsquo;t be a coincidence. Chu Feng, could the Nine Realms Immortal Region be the fortuitous encounter Chaotic Era Scholar left for you?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng looked at the amazing phenomenon brought about by the Nine Realms Immortal Region as his heart pounded in excitement. He, too, shared Eggy&rsquo;s deduction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good chance this is Elder Chaotic Era Scholar&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You should quickly make your way there!&rdquo; Eggy urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You should head there,&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to the old man and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Thank you, milord!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man profusely kowtowed to Chu Feng with his clansmen. There should have been no need for them to ask for Chu Feng&rsquo;s permission since the Nine Realms Immortal Region wasn&rsquo;t his possession, but they were so afraid of Chu Feng that they dared not to do anything that went against his will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng ignored them and headed to where Long Xiaoxiao was at.</span></p></div>
