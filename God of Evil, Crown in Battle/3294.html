        <div> - Bloodline Response<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior, in that case, it would mean that the power of the lightning released from my body earlier is comparable to attacks from an expert of the Utmost Exalted realm?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked. He wanted to verify this matter, as it was simply too unfathomable.<br>He was only a rank five Martial Immortal. Yet, he was able to unleash power capable of obliterating even Exalted-level experts. That was simply too frightening, so frightening that even Chu Feng himself felt skeptical.<br>&ldquo;Above the Exalted realm would naturally be the Utmost Exalted realm. Fortunately, this old man noticed that something was amiss, and I was able to keep my distance from you. Otherwise, I would&rsquo;ve likely been obliterated by you.&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had a wry smile on his face. The scene earlier was simply too frightening. That lightning was so powerful that even he would not be able to withstand them at all. Fortunately, he avoided them, otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t even know how he had died.<br>Because of that, even someone like him felt lingering fear. After all, that was a matter of life and death. As for him, he had nearly died.<br>&ldquo;This is truly strange. I clearly didn&rsquo;t manage to grasp my bloodline&rsquo;s power. Thus, how could I give rise to such a strong power?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had a complicated expression. He was both pleasantly surprised and confused.<br>He had not only learned about the destructiveness of the lightning from the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief; he had also confirmed it to have actually happened through the cracks left on the stones.<br>Utmost Exalted-level power capable of killing all Exalted-level experts. Yet, Chu Feng was completely unharmed after unleashing such overwhelming power. From this, it could be seen that this power would not bring him any harm. However, all those besides Chu Feng would be met with the destruction of that power.<br>If he was able to gain control over that power, the results would be&hellip; simply unimaginable.<br>The reason for that was because no one would expect that a person of the younger generation like Chu Feng would be capable of unleashing a power so strong that it could obliterate all Exalted-level experts.<br>After all, Exalted-level experts were all top experts in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>&ldquo;Senior, did I unleash that lightning an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time ago?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, it was an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time ago. The lightning was nine-colored and covered an area of ten thousand meters. However, it only lasted for a very brief moment. It can be said that it appeared and disappeared like a flash,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief knew that Chu Feng had no idea how he had unleashed that lightning. Thus, he tried to give Chu Feng as much details as possible so as to assist him.<br>&ldquo;An incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time ago, was it?&rdquo; Chu Feng began to ponder. However, no matter how he pondered, the result was the same. He had not felt anything strange an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time ago.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, why don&rsquo;t you use the same method as before and try it again?&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had realized that the lightning that Chu Feng had unleashed earlier was not under his control. However, he hoped that he would be able to gain control over that power.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded. Then, he sat down cross-legged and started to repeat the method of how he had connected with his bloodline&rsquo;s power earlier.<br>After Chu Feng began, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, who was standing in the sky above Chu Feng, retreated over ten thousand meters away.<br>He was uncertain as to whether Chu Feng might unleash that sort of lightning again, and whether the lightning would expand in their destructive range.<br>However, he was certain that should he be engulfed by that lightning, he would definitely die.<br>However, after two hours passed, the lightning did not appear.<br>As for Chu Feng, his complexion grew increasingly pale, and his body grew increasingly weak. Even his breathing became frantic.<br>It could be seen that attempting to control one&rsquo;s bloodline&rsquo;s power was very exhausting. This was already the case when Chu Feng did not grasp it. Should he truly grasp it and manage to unleash it all, the price that he would have to pay&hellip; would definitely be very serious.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was unable to endure it any longer. Finally, he opened his eyes.<br>Upon opening his eyes, Chu Feng observed the stones around him. After doing that, he revealed a disappointed look. He said, &ldquo;It would appear that the lightning did not reappear.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt perplexed. He deeply wanted to gain control over that frightening lightning power. Unfortunately, he had absolutely no clue as to how he could do so. In fact, he didn&rsquo;t even know how that frightening power appeared.<br>He was not afraid of difficulty and suffering. The only thing he feared was being lost. And at that moment, he felt as if he was lost. Even if he were to exhaust all of his strength and determination to do one thing, he would not know how to do it.<br>That sort of feeling caused Chu Feng to feel very powerless.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that power was not something that you activated intentionally. However, it is most definitely not random,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief walked over to Chu Feng in midair and descended beside him.<br>He knew that Chu Feng had failed. He also knew that he didn&rsquo;t know how to control that power. However, he was looking at Chu Feng with confidence-filled eyes.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what do you think is going on with the lightning?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked. He felt that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief must&rsquo;ve realized something.<br>&ldquo;Great powers are all living, and all possess intelligence. Weapons possess them, secret skills possess them, and Divine Powers also possess them. Naturally, Heavenly Bloodlines will also possess life and intelligence.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s merely that we are unable to communicate with them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the reason why, it is naturally because we do not possess sufficient qualifications, and do not have the approval of our bloodlines.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although we surpass ordinary people thanks to the power of our bloodlines, we have never truly grasped our bloodline&rsquo;s power. Although we are able to sense the destructive power of the nine enormous lightning beasts, we are simply unable to utilize their power at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you are different.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve attempted to gain control over the true power of your Heavenly Bloodline. Although you did not succeed, you have gotten a response from them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for their response, it was that lightning from earlier,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you mean to say that the release of that lightning was not because of me, but rather that they were released on their own? My bloodline deliberately revealed the lightning to me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Although I cannot be certain, this old man can guess that that is most likely the case.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, there are countless people that possess Heavenly Bloodlines. However, how many of them are actually able to gain their bloodline&rsquo;s acknowledgement?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not to mention others, even your grandfather and your father never revealed such heaven-defying power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet you have managed to accomplish that, accomplish something that neither your father nor your grandfather were capable of.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you must not be discouraged. You must press on. Perhaps this process will be very difficult. However, as long as you persevere, with your talent, you will definitely succeed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, you will be completely unrivaled,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was staring straight at Chu Feng. A different sort of light was shining deep in his eyes.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was not merely saying those words for no reason. He truly felt that way. He was filled with confidence in Chu Feng, and firmly believed that he would shine brighter than both his father and grandfather in the future.<br></p></div>
