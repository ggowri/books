        <h1>Chapter 4985</h1>
        <div>: Where Are You Going<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time passed quickly.<br>It didn&rsquo;t take long for several days to pass, but Chu Feng was still unable to see through the mechanism before him. He initially thought that there was some pattern to the mechanism, but that wasn&rsquo;t the case at all.<br>The changes in the mechanism seemed to be random.<br>Unless Chu Feng could predict the future or could move at extreme speeds, it would be impossible for him to pass through. So, he turned to the Divine Deer for help, but he receive no response whatsoever.<br>As a result, the group found themselves stuck.<br>To make things worse, the spirit formation gate behind them had vanished after they stepped into this world. There was no way for them to return at all.<br>Meanwhile, the Godwish Grandmother,<br>Lady of Dao Sea, and the others began to worry.<br>&ldquo;Senior, could something have happened to them? How much do you know about the Monstrous King&rsquo;s Soul Mound?&rdquo;<br>Lady of Dao Sea asked.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, nothing will happen to them. They&rsquo;ll be able to obtain what they want to.&rdquo;<br>The Godwish Grandmother appeared more confident.<br>&ldquo;But that humanoid monster earlier doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a manifestation of a formation. It&rsquo;s a real sentient being. Do you know anything about it?&rdquo;<br>Lady of Dao Sea asked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about it, but you can be assured that your Lele and my Yun&rsquo;er will be able to walk out of that place alive,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother said confidently.<br>The Lady of Dao Sea was still worried, but she chose to keep her concerns to herself for the time being. It was impossible for her to do anything other than to wait now.<br>&hellip;<br>Meanwhile, in another realm of the Nine Souls Galaxy, a silhouette was swiftly flitting forward. She was from the Totem Galaxy&rsquo;s Situ World Spiritist Clan, Situ Zhonglan.<br>She was holding onto a tracking talisman, which led her toward a vast marshland.<br>It was still sunny a moment ago, but the moment she entered the marshland, the poisonous miasma veiled the sky, making it the surroundings pitch black as though night had descended.<br>Something of this extent might be an impediment to ordinary cultivators, but not to Situ Zhonglan. Even so, she chose to proceed carefully.<br>She was tracking down the other members of the Situ World Spiritist Clan who had come to Nine Souls Galaxy together with her.<br>She had learned that her clan members were in danger but still alive, so she deduced that they must have met with trouble. That was why she rushed all the way here to save them.<br>What left her even more worried was that there was one person in the group who was even stronger than her, and that person was Situ Duanyu.<br>Situ Duanyu was a God-cloak World Spiritist, possessing strength comparable to a Half God level cultivator.<br>However, based on the state of the Life Talismans, it would appear that even Situ Duanyu was in a precarious position.<br>That was the reason why she, despite being a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator, had to tread carefully. She even resorted to a concealment formation to hide her own presence.<br>It was not that she was timid, but faced with something that could threaten even Situ Duanyu, she had no choice but to maintain the highest level of vigilance. In fact, if the situation was worse than she had thought, she was even prepared to abandon the others and escape.<br>She had only come here to see who dared to make a move on their Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>It was one thing if Situ Duanyu and the others had entered a dangerous ancient remnant, but if someone really dared to make a move on their clan members, she swore that she would make that person regret dearly with their life. She would show them how terrifying their Situ World Spiritist Clan was.<br>Wu!<br>Situ Zhonglan could vaguely hear some sounds. It was extremely faint, reminiscent of a pained wail, but she recognized them to be from her clan members.<br>However, it only made her feel even worse. Beads of sweat trickled down her face. She didn&rsquo;t rush in right away to save her clan members. Instead, she hesitantly stood on the spot, considering her options.<br>After a brief internal struggle, she formed a series of hand seals that lit up her eyes. It was one of the discernment means of the Situ World Spiritist Clan. To be frank, she dared not to advance any further, so she decided to use this skill so as to better assess the situation.<br>She saw several trees in the depths of the marshland, each one having a human tied upside-down to it. However, what was truly frightening was the state of these humans.<br>Their hands had been severed, their eyes had been dug out, their noses had been sliced off, and their tongues had been slitted.<br>What made the situation even more bone-chilling was how their severed body parts were placed neatly right under them.<br>These people were members of the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>Some of the people whom Chu Feng had encountered at the Zhuge Clan were there, but even the God-cloak World Spiritist, Situ Duanyu, was amongst them as well. He was powerless against this adversity.<br>Situ Zhonglan felt utterly horrified by the sight, but not just because of its cruelty. She was aware that the Situ World Spiritist Clan had used such torture methods on others before.<br>This meant that the culprit behind this was an enemy of their Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>&ldquo;Damn it.&rdquo;<br>It was at that moment Situ Zhonglan decided to retreat. Even though the people in front of her still could be saved, she had no intention of doing so.<br>She slowly took several steps back before turning around to escape from this sinister ground.<br>Just as she was about to flit off, an old voice echoed behind her.<br>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
