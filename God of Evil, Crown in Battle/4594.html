        <div>: Asura Graveyard<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to die? Calm down and tell me what&rsquo;s going on. As long as I&rsquo;m able to help you, I&rsquo;ll surely do everything I can,&rdquo; Chu Feng exclaimed anxiously.<br>He didn&rsquo;t dare to fool around when it came to matters relating to a person&rsquo;s life and death.<br>From Song Yun&rsquo;s explanation, he learned that she had been ill for a long time now, so she didn&rsquo;t have much time left. Not too long ago, she discovered an item that could alleviate her illness named Divine Rejuvenation Pearl.<br>However, obtaining the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl was easier said than done. At the very least, Song Yun wasn&rsquo;t confident of obtaining it with her current means.<br>However, she felt that Chu Feng could help her on this matter.<br>She had heard rumors of Chu Feng&rsquo;s feats, and she knew that Chu Feng was not just a rank six Utmost Exalted level cultivator but a world spiritist who had powers at rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>A proficient world spiritist happened to be required to obtain the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl. This was also the reason why Song Yun was seeking Chu Feng for help.<br>&ldquo;It seems like you already know where the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl is?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I do know. However, we&rsquo;ll need to make haste if we wish to obtain it, or else we won&rsquo;t be able to make it in time. Otherwise, I wouldn&rsquo;t be in such a rush either.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, I know that you&rsquo;re a busy man. If I wasn&rsquo;t forced to a corner, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to trouble you either. I&hellip; really didn&rsquo;t intend for this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>As Song Yun spoke, her eyes started to redden as tears began pattering down on the ground.<br>Her pitiful state left Chu Feng felt a little uncomfortable inside.<br>There were no humans who didn&rsquo;t fear death, let alone a young child like Song Yun. It hadn&rsquo;t been long since she arrived in this world, so there was no way she could accept losing her life just like that.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry. As you said, there&rsquo;s still hope, right? Since the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl is useful for you, I&rsquo;ll obtain it for you. Let&rsquo;s set off right away then,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment.&rdquo;<br>However, Song Yun suddenly stopped him.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, do you want to reconsider it first?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Reconsider it? Your life is at stake here! What do I have to reconsider?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied in confusion.<br>It was just a moment that Song Yun was asking for his help, but right after he agreed to it, she suddenly asked him to reconsider the matter. He really couldn&rsquo;t make sense of what was going through herhead.<br>&ldquo;This trip will be very dangerous. I don&rsquo;t want you to head there without knowing what to expect. If something happens to you along the way, I&rsquo;ll be indebted to you for life,&rdquo; Song Yun said.<br>&ldquo;Silly girl. You have come all the way to the Holy Light Galaxy to oppose the Holy Light Clan in order to save me. What dangers could I possibly not dare to brave for you? Or could it be that you think of me as a person who knows not of gratitude?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, I know that you&rsquo;re a rare good person in the world, or else I wouldn&rsquo;t have come here to save you. However, the place that we&rsquo;re heading to is simply too dangerous. In fact, it&rsquo;s known to bethe most treacherous location in the Nine Souls Galaxy,&rdquo; Song Yun replied.<br>&ldquo;The most treacherous location? It can&rsquo;t be that the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl is a treasure of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, and you want to steal it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>If that was the case, it would really be a little tricky on his end.<br>Of course, he was more than willing to offend any behemoths if it was to save the life of his friend, but Xian Miaomiao was the princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. Even if he were to put aside their close relationship, he was still as indebted to Xian Miaomiao as he was to Song Yun.<br>It would be ungrateful of him to steal the treasures of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan after having been done such a favor.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that. However&hellip; it&rsquo;s a place which even the Nine Souls Sacred Clan doesn&rsquo;t dare to venture into,&rdquo; Song Yun replied.<br>&ldquo;Oh? Where&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br>Hearing Song Yun&rsquo;s words, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a little intrigued.<br>&ldquo;The Asura Graveyard,&rdquo; Song Yun replied.<br>&ldquo;Asura Graveyard? What kind of place is that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He was already curious about the place, and the word &lsquo;Asura&rsquo; only further sparked his interest.<br>As an Asura World Spiritist, there was probably no one who understood the significance of &lsquo;asura&rsquo; better than he did. And according to Song Yun, the graveyard indeed had something to do with the world spirits of the Asura Spirit World.<br>It was just that those world spirits were no longer world spirits but evil spirits.<br>World spirits needed a world spiritist as a medium in order to enter the world of cultivation. In order to sustain their existence there, they needed to stay together with a world spiritist and rest inside a world spiritist&rsquo;s world spirit space.<br>If a world spirit were to break its contract with a world spiritist and attempt to exist independently in the world of cultivation, it would become an evil spirit.<br>Evil spirits were mostly unscrupulous and vicious nature, and their method of raising their cultivation was through devouring natural energies too. As such, the unrestrained evil spirits would unhesitatingly go on mass slaughters, making them their very existence a calamity to the weak.<br>Even ordinary evil spirits were fearful beings, let alone those from the Asura Spirit World. After all, the Asura Spirit World was the peak of the Seven Spirit Worlds!<br>And in the Asura Graveyard, there were countless Asura Evil Spirits.<br>No one knew whether these Asura Evil Spirits had come from the Ancient Era or after that, but it was certain that they had already existed for tens of thousands of years.<br>Against such powerful, malevolent beings, there was hardly anyone who had entered the Asura Graveyard who was able to escape with their lives.<br>According to the rumors, the furious howls of the evil spirits could be heard loud and clear even from the entrance of the Asura Graveyard. Just the screams of these evil spirits could drive cultivators berserk, compelling them to massacre all around them. There were also some who were enchanted by the voices and ended up walking into the Asura Graveyard in a trance.<br>It was said that there were even some cultivators, who were weaker in mind and body, that exploded on the spot!<br>It was clear just how frightening those evil spirits were from this.<br>Fortunately, the evil spirits in the Asura Graveyard were bound by a powerful formation and couldn&rsquo;t leave the area, or else&hellip; the consequences would truly be unimaginable.<br>&ldquo;So, the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl is inside the Asura Graveyard?&rdquo; Chu Feng sought confirmation.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not exactly so, but the location is very close to the Asura Graveyard,&rdquo; Song Yun said.<br>&ldquo;Silly girl. Since we don&rsquo;t need to enter the Asura Graveyard, what is there to fear? Didn&rsquo;t you mention yourself that those Asura Evil Spirits are bound by the formation and are unable to leave the area? As long as we don&rsquo;t get too close to the Asura Graveyard, we&rsquo;ll be able to limit the risk we&rsquo;re exposed to.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not waste any time and set off right now. Otherwise, if we&rsquo;re too late, I&rsquo;m afraid that I&rsquo;ll be haunted by you for the rest of my life!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng chuckled as he urged Song Yun to lead the way.<br>Song Yun was still a little hesitant about it even though she was the one who made the favor in the first place. She began leading the way for Chu Feng, but in the midst of the journey, she kept warning him again and again, almost as if to dissuade him.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you don&rsquo;t know how frightening those evil spirits are! There are many legends surrounding them, and there are rumors that they possess the frightening power to beguile a person&rsquo;s heart. Even if they are unable to leave the Asura Graveyard, they are still able to exert some level of control over those that come in their vicinity. Those who come under their influence will find themselves walking into the Asura Graveyard and become helpless prey!<br>&ldquo;Even if we put aside the threat posed by the Asura Graveyard itself, the region itself isn&rsquo;t all safe either. That&rsquo;s the territory of the Wretched Black Demon!&rdquo; Song Yun exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;Wretched Black Demon? Who is that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the strongest world spiritist of our Nine Souls Galaxy. No, to be more exact, he&rsquo;s a world spiritist that&rsquo;s on par with the Sagacious Grandmaster. However, there&rsquo;s no doubt that the Wretched Black Demon is far more frightening than the Sagacious Grandmaster!&rdquo; Song Yun said.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s comparable to the Sagacious Grandmaster?&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked in astonishment.<br>This was the first time he was hearing about the Wretched Black Demon, but he had an opportunity to meet the Sagacious Grandmaster in person. The Sagacious Grandmaster was an unfathomably powerful individual whom Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t even peer into.<br>Even the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Shengguang Xuanye, was likely to be no more than a cannon fodder before the Sagacious Grandmaster.<br>If the Wretched Black Demon possessed powers on par with the Sagacious Grandmaster, he had to be a very incredible figure indeed.<br></p></div>
