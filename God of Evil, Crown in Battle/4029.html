        <h1>Chapter 4028</h1>
        <div> - Heaven-defying Bloodline<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Fucking hell! That old bastard Ox-nose truly stepped on some dog shit luck!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How did he manage to find a younger generation of this caliber?!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Grandmaster Tang Chen started cursing loudly. Both his tone and his expression fully manifested to the extreme, just how much he envied the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Master, brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline power is indeed very strong. I&hellip; when I saw his bloodline power earlier, I felt like my own bloodline's power was being suppressed,&rdquo; said Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;It wasn't only you; when his bloodline&rsquo;s power appeared, even this old man&rsquo;s bloodline power was suppressed,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;What? Even you master&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Even though Yuan Shu had already realized that Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline was very powerful, he only realized that he had still underestimated his bloodline after hearing what his master said.<br>Soon, Yuan Shu&rsquo;s expression changed. He seemed to have thought of something.<br>&ldquo;Master, you once said that Lu Jie&rsquo;s world spiritist bloodline is very powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If Lu Jie&rsquo;s bloodline is to be compared to brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline, how would it compare?&rdquo; Yuan Shu suddenly asked with a serious expression.<br>He knew very well who Lu Jie was.<br>Lu Jie could be said to be the most powerful representative of the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s next generation of world spiritists.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen had always told Yuan Shu to set surpassing Lu Jie as his goal.<br>However, Yuan Shu had ended up being left further and further behind by Lu Jie.<br>The two of them were clearly of similar age, and the difference between them was not much at the beginning too.<br>Yet...<br>As such, Lu Jie held a special status in Yuan Shu&rsquo;s heart.<br>To Yuan Shu, Lu Jie was not a simple genius. Instead, he was an insurmountable mountain.<br>Lu Jie served as a form pressure, an enormous pressure to Yuan Shu. Just thinking about the name Lu Jie was so stifling to Yuan Shu that he would find breathing difficult.<br>&ldquo;Lu Jie compared to Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could he possibly compare? If Lu Jie is the earth, then Chu Feng would be heaven. How could he possibly compare? What makes him think he can be compared to Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>After being asked to compare Lu Jie and Chu Feng, Grandmaster Tang Chen revealed a deep contempt for Lu Jie.<br>&ldquo;Ox-nose, oh Ox-nose, you damned old bastard, you&rsquo;re truly quite remarkable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder you were unable to find a disciple all these years.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And here I thought you had bad luck, and were unable to find a talent to nurture.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only today that I've realized that it&rsquo;s not that you never encountered any talented saplings. Rather, you were meticulous in your choosing. In the end, you old bastard, you&rsquo;ve managed to obtain quite an exceptional sapling.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lost. I&rsquo;ve lost. That disciple of yours far surpasses my own.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen was still filled with envy and jealousy as he said those words.<br>&ldquo;So brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline power is actually that powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Great. This is truly great news.&rdquo;<br>Upon learning that Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline power far surpassed Lu Jie&rsquo;s, Yuan Shu revealed an ecstatic look. He felt tremendous joy for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s great about that?! Go and enter closed-door training immediately!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Remember, if you&rsquo;re unable to grasp the Dragon Transformation Sensation, you are not allowed to leave!&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen shouted angrily at Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Maser, please rest assured. This disciple will definitely not disappoint you,&rdquo; Yuan Shu guaranteed.<br>&hellip;...<br>Although Chu Feng had left the Seven Suns Mountain Range, he had not left the Reincarnation Upper Realm.<br>Instead, he'd proceeded for the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>There were too many things that he needed to do.<br>He needed to remove Bai Liluo&rsquo;s curse.<br>Besides, he himself had also been inflicted with a serious poison.<br>That poison was from the time he'd competed for the Ancestral Martial Decastars. In the depths of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound, he had encountered a powerful demonic substance.<br>Not only did that demonic substance take away Chu Feng&rsquo;s Qilin Egg and leave a powerful poison in his body. It had also ordered him to seek it out once he became an Utmost Exalted.<br>[1. Ch. 3479]<br>Although the poison had never affected Chu Feng, he was able to sense how terrifying it was. If that poison were to erupt, he might end up losing his life.<br>As such, Chu Feng had to go find that demonic existence.<br>Apart from that, Chu Feng also had a lot of other things he needed to do.<br>As such, he didn&rsquo;t know when he would be able to meet his friends again after parting with them.<br>It was just like when he had parted with his friends from the Nine Provinces Continent, the Eastern Sea Region, and the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng wanted to see Zhao Hong again and properly bid his farewell to her before leaving.<br>However, when Chu Feng arrived at the Red-dress Holy Land, he discovered that it was bustling with noise and excitement.<br>A lot of people from other powers had appeared outside the Red-dress Holy Land. Furthermore, the majority of those powers were renowned in the All-heaven Starfield.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t even need to question why those people were there. He already knew the reason right away.<br>They were most definitely there to make connections with the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>After all, many people from various powers had witnessed the battle with their own eyes.<br>They all knew that Zhao Hong was the strongest person of their All-heaven Starfield.<br>Although she did not re-establish the Reincarnation Sect, it was easy to figure out her relationship to Han Xiu.<br>As such, whilst those people seemed to be trying to curry favors and make connections with the Red-dress Holy Land, they were actually there to pay their respects to Zhao Hong, the strongest existence of the All-heaven Starfield.<br>Had it been the Red-dress Holy Land from before, they might close their gates and refuse all those people.<br>However, this time around, they actually ended up providing them with warm hospitality.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng realized that, with Zhao Hong&rsquo;s suggestion, the Red-dress Holy Land had prepared themselves to become the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s new overlord.<br>The reason they were providing warm hospitality was naturally not because they feared the strength of those powers.<br>Rather, the reason behind their warm hospitality was because they wanted everyone to know. Their Red-dress Holy Land fully intended to become the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s overlord.<br>Due to their fear of the Red-dress Holy Land, regardless of the status of the powers that came to pay a visit, they all arrived in an orderly manner, and did not dare to fly in the air of the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>They were showing their respect for the Red-dress Holy Land, and expressing their allegiance to them.<br>Right when Chu Feng was about to reach the Red-dress Holy Land, a war chariot was seen flying through the sky.<br>That war chariot was very special. The body of the war chariot was made of white jade. There were clouds and mists hovering around the chariot, and It was emitting an air of immortality. It seemed like the vehicle of some sort of immortal.<br>That war chariot was so enormous that it simply seemed like a giant palace. It was capable of carrying one hundred thousand people without any issue.<br>It simply resembled a giant mountain flying in the sky.<br>Due to the enormous size of the war chariot, it was also pulled by giant monsters.<br>Those giant monsters were all over a hundred meters in size. Furthermore, there were over ten thousand such giant monsters.<br>Even though those monsters were enormous, their appearances were not fierce.<br>On the contrary, they all seemed like celestial beings and were extremely beautiful.<br>Their appearances resembled that of deers, and their bodies were a white color resembling the jade that made up the body of the chariot.<br>Illuminated by the brilliant sunshine, those creatures glistened beautifully.<br>The appearance of the war chariot caught the attention of everyone present.<br>Even though the powers that had come were all mighty and powerful, the disparity between them and the war chariot was still huge.<br>Most importantly, the war chariot flew very high, far higher than the height of the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>This sort of behavior was one of disrespect. It was completely disregarding the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>As such, from the moment the war chariot appeared, it immediately caused a huge ruckus. Many people were discussing which ignorant fool dared to come to the Red-dress Holy Land to cause trouble at such a time.<br>&ldquo;Impudent!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You dare to fly so high in the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s territory?! Scram immediately, or else I, Zhao, will teach you a lesson.&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, someone was soon unable to tolerate the war chariot, and actually leapt into the air and blocked its path.<br>That person was called Zhao Yongzhou. His strength was rather impressive. He was the overlord of an Upper Realm in the All-heaven Starfield, and possessed the cultivation of rank one Utmost Exalted.<br>He was actually trying to curry favor with the Red-dress Holy Land with his action. At the same time, he wanted to show his desire to serve them.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a white ray of light flew out of the war chariot and shot straight towards Zhao Yongzhou.<br>That white light was extremely fast. In a flash and with a &lsquo;putt,&rsquo; it passed through Zhao Yongzhou&rsquo;s body and left behind a splatter of blood.<br>With that, Zhao Yongzhou lost his ability to fly and, like a loose kite, began falling from the sky.<br>Zhao Yongzhou&rsquo;s subordinates immediately rushed over to catch him.<br>&ldquo;Lord Headmaster!&rdquo;<br>Soon, screams sounded.<br>Upon closer inspection, the crowd present were all terrifyingly alarmed.<br>The reason for that was because the Utmost Exalted level Zhao Yongzhou no longer showed any signs of life. He had been killed!<br></p></div>
