        <div> - Obtaining Justice<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;The ones that attacked my Chu Heavenly Clansmen earlier are not limited to only the Tantai Heavenly Clan. Do you all plan to scram out yourselves, or do you want me to do it for you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to admit your mistake yourselves, there is still leeway. If you are to force me, Chu Feng, to act, then you won't even have the chance to admit your mistake.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice was ice-cold, and his gaze was gloomy. His every word sounded like the arrival of death. They were filled with pressure.<br>Seeing Chu Feng like that, even the bystanders felt afraid. As for the people that had attacked the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, they were naturally even more afraid.<br>Chu Feng swept his gaze across everyone present. When Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze landed on the people that had attacked the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, their hearts not only trembled, but they also immediately started to sweat cold sweat from fear.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that they were cowardly. Rather, it was because they knew that they'd been exposed the instant Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze landed on them. Chu Feng knew who they were. There was simply no way for them to conceal the truth.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, we were wrong, we were wrong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We were possessed by greed, please, please give us another chance.&rdquo;<br>People from various powers all stood forth and directly knelt on the ground.<br>They were not people without dignity, and not cowards. Merely, as they were the ones in the wrong, and Chu Feng was behaving in such a ruthless manner, they knew that standing out and admitting to their mistake was the best choice.<br>After all, Chu Feng dared to even kill people from the Tantai Heavenly Clan. Thus, how could they possibly survive?<br>If they stood out and admitted to it, then perhaps they might be able to live. Otherwise&hellip; it was likely that no one would be able to save them.<br>&ldquo;In addition to the people that attacked my Chu Heavenly Clansmen, those that attacked the people of my Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, scram out here,&rdquo; Chu Feng added.<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, not to mention the people from various powers all over the Ancestral Martial Starfield, even the people from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were startled. Disbelief was present in their bewildered eyes.<br>It was completely reasonable for Chu Feng to avenge the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>But, this situation...<br>Could it be that Chu Feng planned to avenge them too?<br>Chu Feng was planning to avenge the wrongs suffered by the people from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm?<br>Merely, Chu Feng&rsquo;s action caused the people that were previously acting like bystanders enjoying a show to feel gloomy and worried.<br>Because they were afraid of the Chu Heavenly Clan, they did not attack the Chu Heavenly Clansmen. However, that was not the case for the other powers of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>The other powers of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were merely ants in their eyes. Thus, in terms of casualties, the other powers suffered much greater casualties than the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>It would be one thing if Chu Feng planned to expose and take care of the people that had attacked the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>After all, only a small number of people had dared to attack them.<br>However, if Chu Feng wanted to expose the people that had attacked the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, it would mean that the great majority of the people present would not be able to escape a calamity.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, this is a bit excessive, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We are able to understand your desire to avenge your Chu Heavenly Clansmen. After all, you have shown us grace and are our benefactor. By both logic and moral obligation, we should not have injured your clansmen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, what sort of relationship do the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm have with you?&rdquo; An aged old man asked.<br>That person was not an ordinary person. He was someone from one of the Ten Great Heavenly Clans, an elder from the Puyang Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;My clan is the overlord of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. All living beings of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm are under the protection of my clan. Yet, you&rsquo;re asking me what sort of relationship they have with me?&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed mockingly. Then, he added, &ldquo;To not even understand this bit of principle, is your position as an elder of the Puyang Heavenly Clan just for show?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; That elder&rsquo;s face turned ashen with anger. However, he didn&rsquo;t know how to refute Chu Feng. After all, what he had said was indeed reasonable.<br>The overlord of an Upper Realm did indeed have a duty to protect its citizens.<br>Merely, the great majority of the Upper Realms&rsquo; rulers did not uphold this duty. Over time, many people had forgotten about it.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng could be said to have reminded them about that long-forgotten duty.<br>&ldquo;Did you all think I was joking?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well, it is you who forced me to act.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng raised his arm. Boundless martial power was released from his palm.<br>Then, Chu Feng waved his arm, and his martial power turned into countless swords that shot out in all directions.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>Screams were heard repeatedly. Several thousand people were pierced by the swords. With pained looks on their faces, they fell to the ground. Upon closer inspection, they had all had their dantians pierced!!!<br>Chu Feng actually really attacked the crowd.<br>Seeing that, how could the people that had attacked the people from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm earlier dare to feign ignorance anymore? One by one, they stood forth and began apologizing to the powers of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>Not to mention the others, not even the powers from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm dared to believe that they, with their lowly status, would be able to obtain apologies from so many people from the major powers.<br>One must know that many of the people that were apologizing to them belonged to the Ten Great Heavenly Clans!!!<br>At the same time as they were feeling astonished, the people from the various powers of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm all turned their eyes to Chu Feng. Gratitude filled their eyes.<br>They knew that the honor that they&rsquo;d received at that moment was not because they themselves were powerful. Rather, it was because of Chu Feng...<br>It was Chu Feng who came out and stood up for them.<br>After those people apologized, Chu Feng no longer gave out severe punishments.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s intention was very simple. Those that had killed his clansmen would naturally have to pay with their lives.<br>That said, that was not all. Chu Feng was also doing this to obtain justice for his Chu Heavenly Clan, obtain justice for the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>He had accomplished that goal. Thus, there was no need for him to become more ruthless and exterminate all those that had committed wrongs. After all, it was still not the right time to do that.<br>It was those people that were in the wrong. Thus, they could only accept the corresponding punishments from Chu Feng.<br>On the other hand, if he was to exterminate them to the last one, he might really start a war.<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, have never thought you all would be grateful when I entered the dark black gate.<br>&ldquo;However, I, had most definitely not brought you all in here because of how powerful the powers standing behind you were.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, all of you, listen carefully. You&rsquo;d best not commit wrongdoings just because there&rsquo;s a major power behind you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to commit wrongs, then you&rsquo;d best hope to not be captured by me, Chu Feng. Otherwise&hellip; I don't care if you&rsquo;re the Heavenly Emperor. I, Chu Feng, will definitely not act courteously towards you.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng no longer bothered with the crowd.<br>He knew very well that no one would truly yield to him, and no one would really be afraid of him, when he did not possess sufficient power.<br>Perhaps those people did not dare to go against him now. However, they were ridiculing him in their hearts, and even thinking about how to retaliate against him.<br>However, none of that mattered. He did not care about them at all. After all, he knew that one day, all the people present would revere him from the bottoms of their hearts, just like how the people from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm and the people from the Nine Provinces Continent did.<br>Perhaps they might still be powerful experts of the world at present. However, Chu Feng was not...<br>This place was not the place hu Feng would stop at. It was merely a stepping stone for him to proceed onward.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you truly alright?&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief arrived beside Chu Feng. Even though he was vigorous and lively, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was still extremely worried about him after personally seeing him enter that terrifying dark black gate.<br></p></div>
