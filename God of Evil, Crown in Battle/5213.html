        <h1>Chapter 5212</h1>
        <div>: Interesting<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Hey! Why are you suddenly attacking this Queen? Little women from the Fairy Spirit World sure are despicable. How dare you hit me in the midst of an amicable conversation? However, you&rsquo;re lucky that I&rsquo;m in a good mood today, so I shan&rsquo;t bully you. Take care of the other little woman first and I&rsquo;ll cross blows with you afterward.&rdquo;<br>Eggy didn&rsquo;t seem to be angry at being assaulted by the woman from the Fairy Spirit World at all.<br>&ldquo;Lass, I respect your guts. There are few world spirits as principled as you in the Asura Spirit World. Very well, this fairy will quickly deal with the other lass before facing you in a fair duel.&rdquo;<br>She was initially guarded against Eggy, but Eggy wasn&rsquo;t showing any aggression toward her at all. That put her mind at ease, allowing her to focus her attention back on Xue Ji.<br>Weng!<br>To her shock, Xue Ji was no longer trying to dodge anymore, instead choosing to launch a frontal attack at her. Somehow, Xue Ji&rsquo;s strength seemed to have undergone a huge growth, enabling her to fight toe to toe with her.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? How did she suddenly become so powerful?&rdquo;<br>The woman from the Fairy Spirit World was confused by the turn of events.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a change in the golden aura around her. Is she burning the golden aura to temporarily gain greater burst power?&rdquo;<br>The woman soon realized what was going on.<br>Xue Ji was drawing greater strength from the golden aura by setting it ablaze, though it would hasten the disappearance of the golden aura too.<br>&ldquo;These Asura World Spirits are not to be underestimated. Who could have thought that they would be able to burn energies externally imbued into them too? Still, she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to employ this measure for long. Once she fully consumes the golden aura, her strength would be reverted to her original cultivation level. By then, she wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance against me.&rdquo;<br>The woman from the Fairy Spirit World didn&rsquo;t lose her composure despite the unexpected situation. While Xue Ji did have the strength to fight with her now, it was still no easy feat for Xue Ji to defeat her.<br>All she had to do was to drag out the fight, and victory would be hers.<br>Pu!<br>Steaming crimson fluid suddenly spurted out from the woman&rsquo;s chest. She lowered her head and saw a little hand piercing through her heart.<br>She stiffly turned her head around and saw Eggy behind her.<br>Unbeknownst to her, Eggy had crept up to her and impaled her heart.<br>Eggy&rsquo;s golden aura had also been set ablaze, burning at a pace even faster than Xue Ji&rsquo;s. Naturally, this translated to even greater power for her. This was also part of the reason she could creep up onto the woman in the midst of their battle without her noticing a thing.<br>&ldquo;You demoness! You lied to me!&rdquo;<br>The woman from the Fairy Spirit World gritted her teeth in fury. She could sense her life slowly flowing away from her. This impale was a fatal blow to her.<br>Knowing that she wouldn&rsquo;t last long, the woman flicked her whip to attack Eggy. She wanted to drag the latter down with her.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Eggy casually waved her arm.<br>Psh!<br>The woman from the Fairy Spirit World was sliced into two. She had already breathed her last as the two halves of her body toppled onto the ground, but her eyes remained lividly widened. There was so much indignance in her eyes that it looked as if she would return as a vengeful ghost.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have to be out of my mind to keep my promise with the likes of you.&rdquo;<br>Eggy flung the blood off from her hand, reverting to her usual clean appearance. After dealing with the woman, she turned her sights to Xue Ji.<br>Both of them had already halted the burning of their golden auras, but Xue Ji was gasping for air. Clearly, the earlier battle had significantly depleted her energy.<br>&ldquo;What do you think? Not too bad, right?&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;As small as you are, you do have some wits,&rdquo; Xue Ji grudgingly acknowledged it.<br>It turned out that despite Eggy&rsquo;s taunts toward Xue Ji, she had been sending voice transmissions to the latter to impart to her the way of setting the golden aura ablaze. In other words, Xue Ji had learned that skill from Eggy.<br>This had all been part of Eggy&rsquo;s plan right from the start.<br>Eggy knew that even though she and Xue Ji had reached peak Half-God level, the restrictions on their powers made it hard for them to rival the woman from the Fairy Spirit World. Under such circumstances, it was wiser for them to catch her by surprise.<br>That was why Eggy didn&rsquo;t join the fight right away, choosing instead to impart to Xue Ji the method of setting the golden aura ablaze. That allowed Xue Ji to exert greater pressure on the woman, which, in turn, opened a small window of opportunity for Eggy to dish out a fatal blow.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the only two ones here now. I shan&rsquo;t take advantage of you. I&rsquo;ll give you some time to recover.&rdquo;<br>Eggy began looking through the possessions of the woman to see if she had anything good. Just as she had expected, the woman did have many treasures on her, including the golden orb and the whip.<br>&ldquo;How despicable.&rdquo;<br>However, Eggy tossed all of them aside moments later.<br>The woman had a formation cast on her that nullified the effects of her treasures once she died. In other words, her treasures were now no different from junk. Even her pills also lost their effectiveness.<br>As for the other world spirits, they couldn&rsquo;t possibly have left anything behind when the woman had devoured their bodies along with their possession via the golden orb.<br>&ldquo;How can someone be that shameless? Pui!&rdquo; Eggy cursed in anger.<br>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, Eggy noticed that Xue Ji had already made her way to the spirit formation gate located at the entrance of the hall. It looked as if she was going to leave this place.<br>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t compete with you anymore. Also&hellip; thanks. For just now.&rdquo;<br>Xue Ji stepped into the spirit formation gate and vanished from sight.<br>Both of them knew from the moment they cleared the earlier trial that they only had a single chance to enter this hall. Once they left, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to come back anymore.<br>Eggy was honestly surprised to see Xue Ji leaving the hall on her own accord. She blinked her beautiful eyes in contemplation, and she soon came to a realization that brought a radiant smile to her face.<br>&ldquo;Interesting.&rdquo;</p></div>
