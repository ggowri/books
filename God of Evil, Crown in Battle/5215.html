        <h1>Chapter 5215</h1>
        <div>: The Dying Demon Spirit King<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let that guy off if I encounter him, but what can I do if I can&rsquo;t even find him? Is he even still here? He might have already left by now. It&rsquo;s a waste of time to continue camping out here,&rdquo; the middle-aged man said.<br>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you just scan the place? With your cultivation, you should at least be able to ascertain his location by spreading your senses out,&rdquo; the lady replied angrily.<br>She felt that her husband wasn&rsquo;t taking her son&rsquo;s grievances seriously.<br>&ldquo;Narrow-minded! Take a look around us! Are we the only ones here? If that&rsquo;s the case, I would have just sealed off the entire place and killed everyone. I wouldn&rsquo;t have to waste time dawdling here!&rdquo; the middle-aged man replied with a cold glint in his eyes.<br>The vicious look on his face showed that he had indeed done such stuff before. He was the type of person to slaughter even the innocent in cold blood.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get that there are other powerhouses here? Those are people we can&rsquo;t afford to offend! Scanning the area under their eyelids is no different from provoking them. The Demon Spirit King is one thing, but do you want me to make an enemy out of Totem&rsquo;s Nine Daoists too? Are you trying to get me killed?&rdquo; the middle-aged man snapped.<br>&ldquo;I-I&hellip; That&rsquo;s not what I mean, but&hellip;&rdquo; the lady hurriedly explained.<br>Despite her arrogant attitude, she was clearly afraid of the middle-aged man.<br>&ldquo;Besides, the fact that our son got outdone by others means that he should train harder!&rdquo; the middle-aged man said.<br>&ldquo;Our son already has good talents. You&rsquo;re the one who refuses to impart to him your true legacy,&rdquo; the lady complained.<br>&ldquo;Father, please impart your true legacy to me. It doesn&rsquo;t feel good to be bullied by others at every turn,&rdquo; the young man added.<br>&ldquo;Hui&rsquo;er, it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want to impart to you my legacy but you have to comprehend it yourself. There&rsquo;s nothing I can do if you aren&rsquo;t able to grasp the crux of it,&rdquo; the middle-aged man said.<br>&ldquo;But father, you should at least show me to full legacy to comprehend. I don&rsquo;t mean any disrespect, but your verbal impartation of the legacy is bound to be incomplete compared to the one in our ancestral land,&rdquo; the young man said meekly.<br>He seemed to be frightened of his father too.<br>&ldquo;The legacy I have imparted to you is indeed not the true legacy, but the goal is to build up your foundation. It&rsquo;ll be of great help to you in the future, especially when we return to the ancestral land,&rdquo; the middle-aged man said.<br>&ldquo;Father, I have been building up my foundation for many years now. How long more do I have to continue this before I&rsquo;m finally ready? Didn&rsquo;t you say that a world spiritist&rsquo;s intelligence is the highest when they are still a junior? At this rate, I won&rsquo;t be a junior anymore by the time I set foot onto the ancestral land!&rdquo; the young man grumbled.<br>&ldquo;All right. I think that you&rsquo;re almost ready too. I&rsquo;ll bring you back to the ancestral land to comprehend the legacy. However, if you fail to grasp it, that&rsquo;ll be on you,&rdquo; the middle-aged man said.<br>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;<br>The young man was delighted to hear those words. That was the place he had been dreaming to visit for many years now.<br>&ldquo;Your grandfather and I learned the core of our capabilities in the ancestral land. I never brought you there because I thought that your foundation isn&rsquo;t strong enough. That&rsquo;s why I have spent the years training your intelligence and imparting to you some of the world spiritist techniques from the ancestral land. You should be able to make some gains if you head there right now. That&rsquo;s why, Hui&rsquo;er, don&rsquo;t disappoint me,&rdquo; the middle-aged man said.<br>&ldquo;Father, I won&rsquo;t disappoint you,&rdquo; the young man replied confidently.<br>&ldquo;What about that bastard? Are we going to let him off just like that?&rdquo;<br>Determined to stand up for her son, the lady was still much more concerned about exacting vengeance on Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I, Yue Lian, won&rsquo;t let him off. The only fate awaiting anyone who dares to bully my son is death. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before he dies in my hands,&rdquo; the middle-aged man said with vicious eyes.<br>He had already placed Chu Feng on his list of targets.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like the big brother Lian I admire!&rdquo;<br>The lady lay her head against the middle-aged man&rsquo;s chest, transforming from an angry shrew into a demure lady. The middle-aged man wrapped his arms around her and pulled her into his embrace. They looked like a truly intimate couple.<br>The young man didn&rsquo;t show much of a reaction to his parents&rsquo; lovey-doveyness. He had already gotten accustomed to it.<br>&ldquo;Those auras&hellip; It&rsquo;s Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Ninth Dragon. They are back? It looks like the Demon Spirit King failed to catch up with them.&rdquo;<br>Yue Lian turned his sights back to the demon coffin. He seemed to have sensed something even though there was nothing to be seen there,<br>&ldquo;Forget it. There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;ll be able to obtain the treasures here anyway. Let&rsquo;s quickly leave this place,&rdquo; Yue Lian said.<br>Together with his wife and son, the three of them left the area.<br>&hellip;<br>Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Ninth Dragon re-entered the pit, dived all the way to its bottom, and went into the final cavern once more. Both of them were in a terribly weakened state. In particular, Daoist Ninth Dragon wouldn&rsquo;t even have been able to stand on his feet if not for Daoist Eighth Dragon&rsquo;s support.<br>&ldquo;Eighth brother, do you think the Demon Spirit King will return here?&rdquo; Daoist Ninth Dragon asked worriedly.<br>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t. He should be suffering from the backlash from his forbidden medicine by now. He could very well lose his life anytime now, so how could he possibly have the strength to come after us?&rdquo; Daoist Eighth Dragon replied.<br>&ldquo;Should we enter now?&rdquo; Daoist Ninth Dragon asked.<br>&ldquo;The gate is still sealed. We won&rsquo;t be able to enter even with the deciphering method. We&rsquo;ll have to wait a while longer,&rdquo; Daoist Eighth Dragon examined the gate before replying.<br>&ldquo;What should we do? We can&rsquo;t let those two nameless juniors lay claim to that treasure! I don&rsquo;t know what the treasure is, but I can feel that it&rsquo;s the most formidable treasure I&rsquo;ve ever seen before. We can&rsquo;t let such a treasure slip past our fingers and fall into the hands of those two nobodies!&rdquo; Daoist Ninth Dragon exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;Those two nobodies have cleared the earlier trial and obtained great power from it. It wouldn&rsquo;t be wise to underestimate them. I am also suffering from the backlash of the forbidden medicine at the moment, so I might not necessarily be a match for them if a fight really breaks out.<br>&ldquo;However, there&rsquo;s nothing to be worried about. I&rsquo;ve already informed our brother, and he happens to be not too far away from here. He should be arriving here very soon. By then, no one will be able to compete with us anymore,&rdquo; Daoist Eighth Dragon said with a confident smile.<br>The pale-faced Daoist Ninth Dragon also revealed a gleeful smile upon hearing those words.<br>Their seventh brother wasn&rsquo;t a God-cloak World Spiritist but a True Dragon World Spiritist. Putting aside the small fry gathered here, even the hidden gods wouldn&rsquo;t be a match for them either.<br>&hellip;<br>Far away from the entrance of the demon coffin, Xue Ji was flitting through the sky and combing the area, searching for something or someone. All of a sudden, she descended to the ground as if she had found her target.<br>She touched the space in front of her, and for some reason, her hand was blocked off even though there wasn&rsquo;t anything there. It was an invisible barrier.<br>Xue Ji took out a key, which swiftly manifested into a spirit formation gate. She stepped through the spirit formation gate and saw a person lying on the other side. It was the Demon Spirit King.<br>The Demon Spirit King was curled on the ground, trembling nonstop while groaning every now and then. He looked hardly as imposing as he did earlier on.<br>&ldquo;How did you sustain such severe injuries?&rdquo; Xue Ji asked with a frown.<br>She could tell that the Demon Spirit King was already on the verge of death.<br>&ldquo;Xue Ji, I was foolish. I should have listened to you and guarded against those two old things. They went against our promise and ganged up on me. I had no choice but to swallow the Forbidden Asura Pill you gave me. I&rsquo;m now suffering the backlash of it,&rdquo; the Demon Spirit King said.<br>&ldquo;How many did you swallow?&rdquo; Xue Ji asked.<br>&ldquo;Everything you gave me,&rdquo; the Demon Spirit King replied.<br>&ldquo;Are you out of your mind? You&rsquo;ll die!&rdquo; Xue Ji replied.<br>&ldquo;I know. I don&rsquo;t have much time left. I&rsquo;m relieved to see you return safely. With that, I can die at peace. It&rsquo;s just that I have one final regret&mdash;I never got to marry you and take you as my wife.&rdquo;<br>The Demon Spirit King looked at Xue Ji with eyes filled with deep emotions, but Xue Ji didn&rsquo;t respond to his feelings.<br>&ldquo;Xue Ji, I don&rsquo;t want to go against your will. That&rsquo;s why I have never touched you even though we have known each other for so long. Now that I&rsquo;m already moments away from death, won&rsquo;t you fulfill a small wish of mine?&rdquo; the Demon Spirit King asked.<br>Still, Xue Ji didn&rsquo;t say a word.<br>&ldquo;Xue Ji, I want to hug you,&rdquo; the Demon Spirit King spoke in a pleading tone.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still thinking about that even when you&rsquo;re already on the verge of death? I&rsquo;ll consider that if you&rsquo;re able to reach peak True God level,&rdquo; Xue Ji replied.<br>&ldquo;Peak True God level? It looks like I&rsquo;ll have to die with this regret then,&rdquo; the Demon Spirit King replied with a bitter smile.<br>Even if he wasn&rsquo;t on the verge of death, peak True God level was still a height that he was unlikely to ever reach in his lifetime.<br>Shoosh!<br>A pill suddenly appeared right before his eyes.<br>It was pitch black, but upon closer examination, it seemed to contain an entire realm. The sheer amount of energy contained within the pill was so terrifying that it would likely implode anyone who dared to consume it.<br></div>
