        <h1>Chapter 3848</h1>
        <div> - Outcome Determined<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You have all truly put forth a lot of effort for the gamble today.&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. We'd originally thought that our opponent would be Yuan Shu. It&rsquo;s only natural that we prepared for this gamble with the utmost care. After all, that boy is truly quite capable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truth be told, we actually also drew up a special method to compete. If everything had gone according to our plan, even that Yuan Shu would be destined to be defeated by us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for you, little brat, there is no need for us to go through all the troublesome effort. Merely the Binding Armor Formation and this horsetail whisk are enough to handle you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, brat, to be able to force us, the Mystic Cave Saints, to use our two treasures, you&rsquo;re quite capable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, your opponent is us. You are simply too inexperienced." The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints spoke with a look of utter complacence.<br>&ldquo;Mystic Cave Saints, you are simply too shameless! Not only are you all going eleven against a single person of the younger generation, but you&rsquo;re actually even using two treasures to plot against your opponent?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mystic Cave Saints, this match is unfair and one-sided!&rdquo;<br>The Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders were all ridiculing and berating the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Unfair and one-sided?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There can never be too much deception in war. How could a match possibly be unfair and one-sided? Only the outcome of the battle matters.&rdquo;<br>The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints disapproved of the ridicules of the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders in a self-righteousness manner. It was as if all that he had done was only natural and correct.<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng spoke loudly, &ldquo;Elders, there&rsquo;s no need to argue with shameless people like them.&rdquo;<br>Even though the Mystic Cave Saints had utilized two treasures and practically gained absolute superiority over him, there was still no fear or panic on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;Brat, you have two choices.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can admit defeat yourself, or you can continue to persist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should you choose the second option, I your daddy will beat you up so badly that you&rsquo;ll be looking for your teeth all over the floor. I will not stop until you admit defeat." said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>Chu Feng let out a faint smile. &ldquo;What if I refuse to take either choice?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You will have to choose one. If you refuse to choose, I will choose for you." said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;What arrogance. Do you really think that you&rsquo;ve dominated everything here?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Little brat, you are truly one to refuse to shed a tear until you see your coffin.&rdquo; said the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; Eldest.<br>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled mockingly.<br>Then, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze turned sharp.<br>His hands overlapped as he formed a hand seal. It seemed like he was planning to control a spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;A deathbed struggle?&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints spoke in unison. However, they were all mocking Chu Feng.<br>Seeing Chu Feng like that, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders felt pained and distressed.<br>Chu Feng had performed outstandingly. Even if he were to concede, they would not blame him.<br>Yet, Chu Feng had refused to admit defeat even when faced with this sort of situation. His spirit had truly moved them.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the earth started to tremble violently.<br>Then, dazzling pillars of light rushed out from beneath the earth in continuous succession.<br>At the same time, an overwhelmingly powerful aura also emerged from beneath the ground and filled the surroundings completely.<br>Upon closer inspection, the interweaving lights had formed a grand formation. With Chu Feng at the center of the grand formation, it covered the entire island. Naturally, the Mystic Cave Saints were also covered by the grand formation.<br>&ldquo;This is&hellip; a spirit formation?!&rdquo; The Mystic Cave Saints started panicking.<br>They were able to sense that the spirit formation was emitting an extremely powerful aura, much more powerful than all of them.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, it&rsquo;s a spirit formation.&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve set up this spirit formation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Impossible! You&rsquo;re already restricted by the Binding Armor Formation. How could you possibly set up such a powerful spirit formation?&rdquo; The Mystic Cave Saints all shook their heads repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;I never said I set up this spirit formation just now." Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean by that? Are you implying that you set up this spirit formation earlier?&rdquo; asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Smart." said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! This little brat actually set up a spirit formation from the very start?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When? Exactly when did you set up this spirit formation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For a spirit formation of this caliber, even if you set it up secretly, it would still take quite some time to do so." said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave saints.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too bad, I didn&rsquo;t spend that much time. Only a bit over two hours." said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Bit over two hours?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that you set it up whilst fighting against Eleventh?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Damn it! We were made fools by this little brat again!&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints came to a sudden realization. Upon doing so, they all became so furious that even their tones changed.<br>They were not the only ones that came to a sudden realization. The others present also realized what had happened.<br>They finally realized why Chu Feng had bothered to battle with the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; Eleventh for two entire hours, even though his strength far surpassed him.<br>It turned out that Chu Feng was not only doing it to deliberately conceal his strength.<br>During the same period of time, he had set up a grand formation beneath the ground without anyone knowing.<br>The Mystic Cave Saints had thought that victory was in their grasp because of their two treasures.<br>However, they didn&rsquo;t know that Chu Feng had made preparations from the very start.<br>Upon realizing everything, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders began to have a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent went without saying. And now, his way of thinking had once again pleasantly surprised them.<br>If Chu Feng had not secretly prepared his spirit formation, he would really have been undoubtedly defeated in the match.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the dazzling light grew brighter and brighter.<br>Chains also began to emerge from beneath the ground, flying straight towards the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>The Mystic Cave Saints attempted to block the chains. Unfortunately, they were simply too powerful. They directly penetrated their spirit power and bound them.<br>Once they were bound by the spirit formation chains, the chains immediately heated up, and began to tear through their bodies.<br>&ldquo;Eeeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints began to howl in grief.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that they were lacking in endurance. It was simply that Chu Feng&rsquo;s grand formation was too powerful.<br>&ldquo;We concede! We concede!&rdquo;<br>Soon, the Mystic Cave Saints began to beg for Chu Feng to stop, and shouted that they conceded.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng retrieved the power of his spirit formation.<br>At that moment, all eleven of the Mystic Cave Saints were lying on their stomachs. Even though their faces could not be seen, one could tell through their body&rsquo;s movements that they were panting for breath.<br>Even though they had only been tortured by the spirit formation chains for a very short period of time, it had inflicted great harm on them.<br>Seeing the miserable looks of the Mystic Cave Saints, the people from the Red-dress Holy Land were all overjoyed. This was precisely what they wanted to see.<br></p></div>
