        <h1>Chapter 5507: Blood-eyed Qilin Clan</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Even though they were humanoid, they had blood-red eyes and were covered in blue scales. Every one of them was at least ten meters tall, regardless of men or women. Even Chu Feng, who couldn&rsquo;t be considered short, looked small in comparison.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The Blood-eyed Qilin Clan?&rdquo; Long Chengyu narrowed his eyes in enmity.</span><br><span>The other Totem Dragon Clansmen and the Totem Phoenix Clansmen also expressed their enmity too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you planning to make a move?&rdquo; the bulkiest and ugliest person from the Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin Clan coldly spouted as he exerted his oppressive might.</span><br><span>The juniors widened their eyes in astonishment.</span><br><span>He, just like Long Chengyu, was a rank five Half-God level cultivator despite being a junior!</span><br><span>Any junior who reached Half-God level was already considered a prodigy. Those who reached rank three Half-God level were prodigies amongst prodigies. As for those who reached rank five Half-God level&hellip; those were the people who stood at the very top of the world of cultivation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Someone that monstrous actually appeared in the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen became even warier. They had thought that the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan was nothing to be feared since they had Long Chengyu here, but who could have thought that the enemy would have a cultivator of the same level too?</span><br><span>In this tense atmosphere, another man stepped forth from the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan. While he had blood-red eyes and blue scales too, he looked less intimidating than his brethren. He held a fan in his hand, which gave him a scholarly look.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I am Qi Weidao. Our clan came here to fulfill a request; we bear no ill will. I presume you&rsquo;re here for the same reason, right? There&rsquo;s no reason for us to cross blows,&rdquo; Qi Weidao said as he opened his palm.</span><br><span>In his palm was a token identical to those in Chu Feng and the others&rsquo; possession.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Whose request are you under?&rdquo; Feng Jiuyue asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the same position. Why ask the unnecessary?&rdquo; Qi Weidao replied with a smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Weidao, don&rsquo;t waste your breath with them,&rdquo; the rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman said before leading his group toward the gate.</span><br><span>A few steps later, they suddenly stopped as if they had bumped into something.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman hurled his fist forward. A loud &lsquo;bam&rsquo; could be heard as if his fist had struck a wall. Yet, there was nothing in front of him at all.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why is there another barrier here?&rdquo; the rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman exclaimed.</span><br><span>Qi Weidao examined the barrier before remarking, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t time yet.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng also inspected the barrier. Indeed, it wasn&rsquo;t time for the barrier to open yet.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? It&rsquo;s one thing for the Totem Phoenix Clan to make a reappearance, but the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan should have long gone extinct! Why are they here? They even have so many powerful juniors amongst them!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the main problem here. They actually have the same tokens as us! Does this mean that we&rsquo;re going to be working together with them?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Rather than the gate, the Totem Dragon Clansmen were much more bothered by the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan.</span><br><span>Chu Feng could sense the animosity in the air, so he asked Long Chengyu, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the background of the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan?&rdquo;</span><br><span>It didn&rsquo;t take long for him to understand why the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan was so hated.</span><br><span>The Blood-eyed Qilin Clan used to be a powerhouse in the olden days, but they were a vile bunch who didn&rsquo;t hesitate to inflict cruelty on others. To master their cultivation skill, they even resorted to feeding on those with special bloodlines.</span><br><span>Many Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen fell prey to them.</span><br><span>Unable to tolerate the death of their clansmen, the Totem Dragon Clan and Totem Phoenix Clan joined hands to hunt down the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan and eventually succeeded in vanquishing them. Who could have thought that they would suddenly make a reappearance here?</span><br><span>To make things worse, they had plenty of prodigies in their midst, which suggested that they might have already recovered from the severe blow they suffered back then. That didn&rsquo;t bode well for the Totem Dragon Clan.</span><br><span>The Blood-eyed Qilin Clan wasn&rsquo;t an easy bunch to deal with.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big sister, I don&rsquo;t think our father knows that the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan is still around and participated in this matter. We need to report this matter to our father and have him reconsider this matter,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>Long Muxi understood what Long Chengyu was getting at.</span><br><span>Given that the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan had a rank five Half-God level cultivator, Long Chengyu had to stay here to curb them, but this matter was of utmost importance. Thus, it was best for Long Muxi to head back to report this matter.</span><br><span>Thus, Long Muxi turned around and headed back, only to find that the formation that she had easily entered earlier was now blocking her way back.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t return anymore?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd noticed that Long Muxi was trapped by the formation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng.&rdquo; Long Muxi turned to Chu Feng in hopes that he could help her out.</span><br><span>Chu Feng stepped forward to inspect the formation. Indeed, there was a change in the formation, and he was unable to decipher it.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu walked over and asked, &ldquo;Are you able to decipher it?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng shook his head.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What the hell!&rdquo; Long Chengyu&rsquo;s face warped with fury.</span><br><span>Averse to cooperating with the likes of the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan, he was planning to inform his father of this matter so that they could call off the partnership or even demand an explanation regarding the reappearance of the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan, but that didn&rsquo;t look possible now.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. We can be considered to be allies now. We won&rsquo;t do anything to you, so you need not escape.&rdquo; The rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman laughed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Escape? The ones who should be trying to escape are you lot!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Unable to tolerate the provocation, he exerted his oppressive might toward them, but the rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman easily blocked it off. The other Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen also didn&rsquo;t look intimidated in the least.</span><br><span>Instead, a savage glint flashed across their eyes as they prepared themselves for a fight.</span><br><span>The rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen revealed an excited look. &ldquo;Long Chengyu, are you sure you want to cross blows with me?&rdquo;</span><br><span>It was then that Qi Weidao stepped forward once more and patted the rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen&rsquo;s shoulder. It looked like he was sending a voice transmission to the latter. Following that, he turned to Long Chengyu and said, &ldquo;Long Chengu, I know that you&rsquo;re strong, but our Blood-eyed Qilin Clan doesn&rsquo;t fear you. I suggest you think things through. Remember the reason you came here in the first place. Does your Totem Dragon Clan have anything to earn from messing this mission up?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s complete our father&rsquo;s mission,&rdquo; Long Muxi told Long Chengyu.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu took in a deep breath before retracting his oppressive might as he </span><span>grumbled, &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t want to cooperate with the likes of them.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;You can always settle the scores later. For the time being&hellip; we can just treat them like how we&rsquo;re treating the Totem Phoenix Clan,&rdquo; Long Muxi said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s no choice,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said with a sigh.</span><br></p></div>
