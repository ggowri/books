        <h1>Chapter 4763</h1>
        <div>: This Is a Misunderstanding<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Big sis, that Chu Feng knows that I&rsquo;m your younger brother, but he still dared to make a move on me!&rdquo; Xia Ran exclaimed tearfully.<br>&ldquo;He dares to make a move on you despite knowing that you&rsquo;re my younger brother? The galls of him!&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan was infuriated to hear those words, but she didn&rsquo;t lose her rationality. Instead, she began asking, &ldquo;How did the conflict between the two of you happen? Were you the one who started the fight?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course not! Big sis, you know what kind of person I am. I&rsquo;ve always treated others kindly, so when have I ever gotten into a conflict with others on my own accord? My grudge with Chu Feng stemmed from&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Xia Ran began recounting to Xia Yan the grudges between him and Chu Feng. Of course, he selectively chose the details of the story so as to make him out to be the reasonable one here whereas Chu Feng was an irredeemable villain.<br>His words shocked all of the spectators.<br>Had they not seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn&rsquo;t dare believe that Xia Ran would be so shameless as to blatantly distort the truth. However, they dared not to say anything out of fear.<br>&ldquo;Those scoundrels! How could there be such a vile person in the North Tortoise Hall? Where is he? Bring him to me!&rdquo;<br>Oblivious to the truth, Xia Yan assumed that everything Xia Ran had said was true. Upon learning that someone dared to bully Xia Ran, she gritted her teeth furiously as murderous intent flickered in her eyes.<br>On the other hand, Xia Ran was overjoyed to see Xia Yan&rsquo;s reaction, though he made sure to maintain an aggrieved look on his face.<br>This was all within his expectations since this was the very scenario he had planned out.<br>After learning that Xia Yan had come out of closed-door training, he had someone send the letter he had prepared beforehand to Xia Yan while heading over to the North Tortoise Hall himself so as to frame Chu Feng.<br>Judging by Xia Yan&rsquo;s reaction, he was confident that Chu Feng would never live past today. He felt gleeful to have managed to devise such an ingenious plan.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a misunderstanding! It&rsquo;s all a misunderstanding!&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, several figures descended upon the area. It was the chief elder and the others.<br>As soon as they learned that Xia Ran was here, they knew that something bad was going to happen, so they rushed over right away.<br>&ldquo;The chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall, you still dare to show your face here! You sure know how to impress me. How can your North Tortoise Hall tolerate such a vile disciple? It&rsquo;s no wonder why the North Tortoise Hall has been declining under your leadership!&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan didn&rsquo;t panic in the face of the chief elder at all. Instead, she continued speaking with her head held up high, as if a lofty princess interrogating a criminal. Yet, no one thought that there was anything wrong with her attitude.<br>She did have the power and background to put on airs here.<br>&ldquo;Xia Yan, it&rsquo;s all a misunderstanding. The truth is not like that,&rdquo; the chief elder tried to explain.<br>Xia Ran stood up and howled furiously, &ldquo;A misunderstanding? Look at my injuries! How could this be a misunderstanding?&rdquo;<br>With Xia Yan backing him now, he had nothing to fear.<br>&ldquo;Xia Ran, the conflict between you and Chu Feng was a minor matter. There&rsquo;s no need to blow things up to this extent,&rdquo; the chief elder advised.<br>&ldquo;Big sis, did you see that? I&rsquo;ve been beaten up to this extent, but the chief elder still dares to say that it&rsquo;s a minor matter. This is the kind of place the North Tortoise Hall is!&rdquo; Xia Ran exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;The chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall, you better hand Chu Feng over right now. Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll invite both of my grandfathers here to have a chat with you,&rdquo; Xia Yan said.<br>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Those words made the faces of the chief elder and the others turn livid.<br>Xia Yan&rsquo;s grandfathers were lofty figures which even the East Dragon Hall and West Tiger Hall dared not to offend, let alone their little North Tortoise Hall. They had long known that Xia Yan would cause trouble once she came out of her closed-door training, but they didn&rsquo;t think that she would react so explosively.<br>With such thoughts in mind, they turned their gazes toward Xia Ran.<br>Under normal circumstances, Xia Yan would indeed not act in such a manner. It was only due to Xia Ran&rsquo;s intervention that things ended up like this.<br>Xia Ran had intentionally inflicted injuries on his own body and fed Xia Yan&rsquo;s lies in order to stoke her anger. To make things worse, Xia Yan refused to listen to their explanation at all.<br>Even the chief elder was feeling despaired at the moment, thinking that there was no way to save Chu Feng anymore.<br>Who could possibly stop Xia Yan and her backing?<br>&ldquo;Oh? Isn&rsquo;t that Brother Xia? I didn&rsquo;t expect that you&rsquo;re actually Xia Yan,&rdquo; a voice suddenly sounded amidst the crowd.<br>The voice seemed to have pricked the crowd as they hurriedly darted aside out of fear of being implicated. As a result, a huge empty space was created amidst the crowd, leaving behind just an isolated individual.<br>Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan&rsquo;s eyes widened in disbelief.<br>The crowd could understand Xia Yan&rsquo;s reaction. It was one thing for Chu Feng not to escape upon learning that Xia Yan wanted to deal with him, but he even ran out with a smile on his face.<br>How could he bring himself to smile so happily under such circumstances?<br>Putting aside Xia Yan&rsquo;s disbelief, even the crowd felt completely incredulous too.<br>Even if you don&rsquo;t fear death, surely you don&rsquo;t have to court death here, right?<br>The chief elder quickly stepped forward to stop Chu Feng, but it was already too late.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>After a momentary shock, Xia Yan began dashing straight toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Xia Yan, it&rsquo;s a misunderstanding. Listen to me, I&rsquo;ll explain it to you.&rdquo;<br>The chief elder quickly stepped forward and grabbed Xia Yan&rsquo;s hand to hold her back, not allowing her to approach Chu Feng at all.<br>&ldquo;Why are you grabbing my hand? Let go of me!&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan glared at the chief elder with eyes so furious that it looked as if she would kill him without hesitation. Her glare frightened the chief elder.<br>Realizing that the situation was really awry, the chief elder quickly bellowed, &ldquo;Chu Feng, hurry up and leave! I&rsquo;ll deal with the situation here!&rdquo;<br>He had already made up his mind here.<br>It isn&rsquo;t easy for such a talented disciple to come to our North Tortoise Hall. Even at the expense of my life, I have to protect Chu Feng!<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng!!!&rdquo;<br>But to the chief elder&rsquo;s astonishment, not only did Chu Feng not run away, but he even walked straight up to Xia Yan&rsquo;s side.<br>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you just listen to me?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s action nearly made the chief elder spurt blood out of sheer frustration. He had already made up his mind to protect Chu Feng with his life, but the latter actually stepped forward to meet his doom.<br>The exasperated chief elder immediately thrust his hand forth, intending to push Chu Feng away forcefully, only to freeze in place before he could do anything at all.<br>Something utterly shocking had just unfolded before his eyes.<br>Xia Yan reached out to grab Chu Feng, but instead of harming him, she pulled him into her embrace. She was so forceful with the hug that even her &lsquo;special parts&rsquo; were squeezed out of shape from being pressed against Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>The rage that was previously on her face also vanished without a trace, replaced with a peal of hearty laughter.<br>In truth, Xia Yan was a person who really loved to laugh, and it wasn&rsquo;t hard to spot her with a smile. However, not a single person had seen her with such a bright smile before.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha! Am I dreaming here? Is that really you? Chu Feng, how did you end up in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect? Could it be that my grandfather brought you here? Ah, it looks like my grandfather suddenly did something good for once. I told him that you were a prodigy, and that it would be a blessing to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to bring you in!&rdquo; Xia Yan began speaking excitedly.<br>From her words, it could be seen that Xia Yan had wanted her grandfather to bring him into the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, and he was thankful for that too. However, he felt that it would still be best to tell Xia Yan the truth.<br>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your grandfather who brought me in. I&rsquo;ve never met your grandfather before,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? If it&rsquo;s not my grandfather, could it be my maternal grandfather then?&rdquo;<br>Her words hinted that she had also recommended Chu Feng to her maternal grandfather too.<br>However, Chu Feng shook his head and said, &ldquo;I was brought here by Elder Duan Liufeng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Elder Duan Liufeng?&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan fell into deep thought. She did remember someone mentioning Duan Liufeng&rsquo;s affairs to her before. Her eyes widened in realization before quickly turning to look at Xia Ran.<br>She pointed a finger at Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Xia Ran, you can&rsquo;t possibly be referring to this Chu Feng, are you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah? T-this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Xia Ran had never seen Xia Yan hugging anyone so tightly before, and he could vaguely sense a hint of killing intent in Xia Yan&rsquo;s eyes too. Xia Yan had never directed such a look toward him before.<br>At this point, he could already tell that there was a peculiar relationship between Chu Feng and Xia Yan. He finally understood why the South Vermilion Hall&rsquo;s Lord Tuoba Jianshu told him not to make an enemy out of Chu Feng and even told him to apologize.<br>It finally occurred to him that he had committed a grave mistake here.<br>Putong!<br>Xia Ran fell to his knees and began bawling.<br>&ldquo;Big sis, this is a misunderstanding!&rdquo;<br></p></div>
