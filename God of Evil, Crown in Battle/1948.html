        <div> - Meeting Long Lin Again<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>After Chu Feng and the others arrived at the Cyanwood Sacred Assembly, they directly proceeded toward the location where Baili Xuankong was resting.<br>At that moment, other than the Compass Immortal, who was giving a lecture outside, all of the Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s important characters were gathered here.<br>Chu Feng mentioned to them what had happened in the Blood Devouring Killing Formation. He was informing them of how powerful and dangerous the Dark Hall was.<br>&ldquo;What? The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master actually possesses the same sort of Inherited Bloodline as you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The World Devastator Immortal joined the Dark Hall?&rdquo;<br>After learning of everything that had happened, none of the people present were able to remain calm. Even Nangong Longjian was frowning deeply.<br>With how powerful the Dark Hall was, if they were to attack the Cyanwood Mountain, even they would not be able to withstand them.<br>Merely, even though they were worried, they could not mention it. The reason for that was because Chu Feng was bearing enough burdens. They could not allow themselves to burden Chu Feng even more.<br>&ldquo;Ancestor, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves and His Majesty the Elf King has already become allies with our Cyanwood Mountain. Furthermore, for the sake of preventing the people from the Dark Hall from attacking our Cyanwood Mountain, he has especially sent one of their Elf Kingdom&rsquo;s Grand Elder, Lord Lianghua, to aid our Cyanwood Mountain,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>After hearing those words, Nangong Longjian&rsquo;s eyes shone. He hurriedly asked, &ldquo;Lord Lianghua? Chu Feng, is what you said the truth?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;When is Lord Lianghua coming?&rdquo; Nangong Longjian asked.<br>The person that was the most experienced among the people here was Nangong Longjian. Thus, he knew about the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; Lord Lianghua.<br>Lord Lianghua was extremely powerful. Nangong Longjian felt that if Lord Lianghua were to come to aid the Cyanwood Mountain, even the Dark Hall would not dare to rashly attack the Cyanwood Mountain. He would be able to ensure the Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s safety.<br>&ldquo;This old man is already here,&rdquo; Right at that moment, Lord Lianghua suddenly walked out from the void.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, sir!!!&rdquo; After seeing Lord Lianghua, other than Chu Feng, Bai Ruochen, Bai Suyan and Jiang Wushang, all the other people were stunned. Even Nangong Longjian reacted in such a manner.<br>It must be said that Lord Lianghua&rsquo;s appearance came as an enormously pleasant surprise to them. He had caused their uneasy hearts to become much more at ease.<br>Lord Lianghua&rsquo;s appearance, Chu Feng&rsquo;s return and the reunion of Nangong Longjian&rsquo;s family were all successive happy occasions. As such, the crowd present were all very happy.<br>Originally, Baili Xuankong had planned to prepare a feast of celebration.<br>However, Chu Feng was unable to sit by for even a single moment. The reason for that was because the reason why he had returned to the Cyanwood Mountain this urgently was actually because of Yao&rsquo;er.<br>After finding out what Chu Feng planned to do, Baili Xuankong made the prompt decision to re-enter the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Remnants with Chu Feng and meet that fellow by the name of Long Lin again.<br>Moreover, this time around, even Lord Lianghua decided to accompany them.<br>As Lord Lianghua was a grand rank eight Martial Emperor, an existence close to becoming a peak Martial Emperor, his company caused the others to feel confident even when facing Long Lin.<br>After passing through the spirit formation, Chu Feng re-entered the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Remnants very smoothly.<br>Soon, Chu Feng and the others appeared in Long Lin&rsquo;s territory again.<br>When Chu Feng saw Yao&rsquo;er, his depressed state of mind immediately felt much better.<br>The reason for that was because not only was Yao&rsquo;er unharmed, her cultivation had also increased. She was no longer a rank one Martial Emperor, and had become a rank two Martial Emperor.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Lord Baili!!!&rdquo; Yao&rsquo;er was overjoyed upon seeing Chu Feng and the others. She immediately dashed toward Chu Feng.<br>To Chu Feng&rsquo;s surprise, that Long Lin fellow actually did not stop Yao&rsquo;er this time around. Instead, he allowed her to run over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side.<br>&ldquo;Not bad. The speed of your breakthrough is even faster than I had anticipated. It seems that you will be able to help me,&rdquo; At that moment, Long Lin was also extremely happy. His gaze was fixed upon Chu Feng the entire time.<br>Long Lin&rsquo;s gaze caused Nangong Longjian and the others to feel extremely uncomfortable and even displeased.<br>The reason for that was because Long Lin only placed Chu Feng in his gaze. Nangong Longjian, Baili Xuankong and even Lord Lianghua, these experts, were all ignored by him.<br>That&rsquo;s right. They were ignored. They were truly ignored. Even though they were within his line of sight, he pretended that they were invisible. Long Lin had simply not placed them in his eyes at all.<br>At this moment, Nangong Longjian felt extremely dissatisfied. He had originally wanted to say something.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right when Nangong Longjian wanted to say something, an aged yet strong hand grabbed his arm.<br>He turned around to look. It was actually Lord Lianghua.<br>Lord Lianghua looked to Nangong Longjian without saying anything. He merely shook his head at Nangong Longjian.<br>&ldquo;!!!!&rdquo;<br>However, that simple action of his caused Nangong Longjian to feel enormous shock.<br>Lord Lianghua&rsquo;s intention was very clear. He was telling Nangong Longjian to not act recklessly, because their opponent was very dangerous.<br>When even Lord Lianghua felt that Long Lin to be dangerous, how could he, Nangong Longjian, possibly have the capability to bicker with him?<br>Thus, even though he was unwilling, Nangong Longjian decided to keep silent. When he looked to Long Lin again, there was an additional cautiousness in his gaze.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I have returned as per our promise. Are you able to release Yao&rsquo;er now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course. However, that&rsquo;s only on the condition that you&rsquo;ll help me do one thing,&rdquo; Long Lin said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please tell me what it is,&rdquo; Chu Feng said. He did not dare to neglect this Long Lin fellow.<br>Even though he was already a Martial Emperor and had met the Elf King, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, Lord Lianghua, the World Devastator Immortal and many other peak experts in the Holy Land of Martialism, the dangerous sensation that Long Lin emitted was still intensely strong.<br>That Long Ling was truly too dangerous, much more dangerous than even the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master. As such, Chu Feng did not dare to neglect him.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very simple,&rdquo; As Long Lin spoke, he took out two items.<br>They were a gate and a sword.<br>The gate was transparent in color. It seemed as if it was formed from glass. It was two meters tall and a meter wide.<br>The sword was emitting red, flickering light and waves of heat. It was forged from fiery iron. It was a fiery seven foot long sword.<br>&ldquo;These are!!!&rdquo;<br>After seeing the gate and the sword, the eyes of everyone present started to shine with astonishment.<br>Neither that gate nor that sword were Incomplete Imperial Armaments, nor were they Imperial Armaments.<br>However, they were things even more precious than Imperial Armaments. They&hellip; seemed to not be possessions of the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>As for that Long Lin, he seemed to have already anticipated that Chu Feng and the others would be shocked.<br>Thus, he did not bother with Chu Feng and the others. Instead, he walked directly over to the giant tree and placed the gate on it.<br>Then, he began to form hand seals and mutter a special chant nonstop.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the gate and the tree fused together. The previously transparent gate actually started to glimmer with light and a distorted space appeared within it.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>Then, Long Lin turned the sword in his hand. Holding the blade of the sword, he pointed the hilt toward Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Hold this sword and go in there. After you cut off all of the vines that bind me, you will be able to take that Yao&rsquo;er girl away.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The vines that bind you?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes shone.<br>&ldquo;Yes, vines that bind me,&rdquo; Long Lin smiled. He did not try to conceal anything.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, as long as you can accomplish this, I will definitely keep my promise,&rdquo; Long Lin added.<br>&ldquo;I hope you will be able to keep your promise,&rdquo; Chu Feng walked forward. He grabbed the hilt of the sword and began to walk toward that entrance.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng!!!&rdquo; At that moment, Baili Xuankong shouted Chu Feng&rsquo;s name. He was very worried. He felt that what Long Lin wanted Chu Feng to do was not that simple. Else, he would not have Chu Feng return here only after he became a Martial Emperor.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, please rest assured. I will return safely,&rdquo; Chu Feng turned around and smiled lightly. Then, with sword in hand, he entered the gate.<br></p></div>
