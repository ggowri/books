        <div> - Unexpected Aid<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the person that appeared before the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, not only were the crowd shocked, but even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were shocked.<br>The reason for that was because this person was the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>But, the Chu Heavenly Clan clearly had no association with the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Why would they come to their aid?<br>&ldquo;Meddling in other people&rsquo;s business?&rdquo;<br>The Xuanming Family&rsquo;s family head narrowed his brows and displayed his displeasure.<br>The Xuanming Family was known for their arrogance.<br>As such, while they&rsquo;d heard the rumors regarding the Red-dress Holy Land, they had never bothered to learn the details of those events.<br>All they knew was that the All-heaven Starfield has had a change in leadership, and its new ruler was the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>However, according to the rumors he had heard, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster was only a rank three Utmost Exalted.<br>The reason why the Red-dress Holy Land was able to defeat the All-heaven Sect was because they were aided by an expert.<br>However, that expert was not someone from the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Thus, he believed that the Red-dress Holy Land had merely taken advantage of the situation and picked up its overlord status.<br>As such, not only did the Xuanming Family&rsquo;s family head not fear the Red-dress Holy Land, but he instead looked down on them.<br>He felt that even if the Red-dress Holy Land was stronger than the Chu Heavenly Clan, they would not be too much stronger.<br>&ldquo;I am not meddling in other people&rsquo;s business. It&rsquo;s just that I am unable to put up with you bullying others so excessively,&rdquo; said Han Xiu.<br>&ldquo;What an inability to put up with bullying excessively. In this world, there are countless things that one cannot put up with.&rdquo;<br>However&hellip; for some things, they are not things that you can involve yourself in just because you want to.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you want to pretend to be a benevolent individual, you&rsquo;ll have to pay the price to do so.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>As the Xuanming Family&rsquo;s family head spoke, he unleashed his oppressive might and shot it straight toward the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>At practically the same time, Han Xiu also unleashed her oppressive might.<br>In the blink of an eye, the two oppressive mights collided.<br>Although their oppressive might was formless, the collision of their oppressive mights caused even the surrounding space to distort.<br>As their oppressive mights wreaked havoc, heaven and earth started to fluctuate. Everyone present could sense how powerful they were.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you&rsquo;re really planning to take me on?&rdquo;<br>The Xuanming Family&rsquo;s family head narrowed his brows. The displeasure on his face grew even more intense.<br>&ldquo;You can give it a try.&rdquo; The Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster was not afraid in the slightest.<br>With this, their oppressive might grew more and more powerful.<br>Even though they did not actually start fighting, their opposing oppressive mights became exceptionally violent.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clansmen and the people from the Xuanming Family were all being repressed by the oppressive might, and forced to retreat.<br>However, the Xuanming Family&rsquo;s family head was gaining an advantage over Han Xiu.<br>As this collision of the oppressive mights continued, the calm on Han Xiu&rsquo;s face disappeared. Merely this confrontation of the oppressive might was starting to force her to put forth a strenuous amount of effort.<br>Even the crowd were able to tell that the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster&rsquo;s oppressive might was inferior to the Xuanming Family&rsquo;s family head&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>This was still only a confrontation of oppressive mights. If they were to truly fight, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster would definitely not be a match for the Xuanming Family&rsquo;s family head.<br>&ldquo;Is this Red-dress Holy Land truly the power that defeated the All-heaven Sect?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why would their headmaster not even be a match for the Xuanming Family&rsquo;s family head?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the All-heaven Sect teach the Xuanming Family a major lesson back then?&rdquo;<br>Sensing the change to the oppressive mights, the crowd began to wag their tongues again.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still not backing out?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Seeing that you&rsquo;re a woman, this old man did not directly attack you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you insisting on making this old man publicly defeat you?&rdquo; The Xuanming Family&rsquo;s family head spoke.<br>He spoke as if he were being lenient toward the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster because she was of the fairer sex.<br>However, his words were not spoken through voice transmission. Instead, he spoke them out loud for everyone to hear.<br>This was not an act of modesty at all. He was clearly trying to show off how powerful he was.<br>Even though the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster didn&rsquo;t say anything and looked unmoved, she was actually starting to panic.<br>She actually didn&rsquo;t know much about the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>When she had first heard about the Chu Heavenly Clan, it was from Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Yin Zhuanghong told her that a very powerful person of the younger generation by the name of Chu Feng had appeared in the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>But, the reason why Han Xiu was helping the Chu Heavenly Clan was not because of Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Instead, it was because of Zhao Hong.<br>Normally, the grand occasion this time around would be the optimal opportunity to reveal the strength of the Red-dress Holy Land. As such, Zhao Hong should&rsquo;ve come.<br>However, it just so happened that she was about to enter closed-door training when they received the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s invitation.<br>As her closed-door training was very important and might end up affecting her future cultivation should she miss it, Zhao Hong had decided that she would enter closed-door training and have Han Xiu lead the people from the Red-dress Holy Land to participate in this grand occasion instead.<br>Before Zhao Hong entered closed-door training, she had mentioned one thing to Han Xiu in passing.<br>She told her to make sure to befriend the Chu Heavenly Clan, and not to have conflicts with them should she encounter them.<br>Apart from that, she didn&rsquo;t say anything else.<br>As such, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster had no idea that Asura, the person who had helped them many times, was actually the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Chu Feng.<br>She was purely coming to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s aid because Zhao Hong had told her to befriend them.<br>Because of Zhao Hong&rsquo;s order, she realized that she must possess some sort of relationship with the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>She was merely helping the Chu Heavenly Clan because she was giving face to Zhao Hong.<br>However, she was feeling slightly regretful of her decision now.<br>She was able to sense that the Xuanming Family&rsquo;s family head was indeed more powerful than her.<br>She was now riding atop a tiger and unable to get off.<br>As she had already stepped in, if she were to cower to him now, she would be ridiculed by others.<br>But, if they were to truly fight and she ended up being defeated, it would inevitably damage the reputation of the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Han Xiu found herself stuck between a rock and a hard place. She had no idea what she should do.<br>&ldquo;Xuan Tianpeng, oh how mighty you are.&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, a figure landed beside the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>When that figure landed, the Xuanming Family&rsquo;s family head&rsquo;s oppressive might was immediately suppressed.<br>Not only that, but he also found himself unable to stand firm, and was forced to move back repeatedly.<br>The reason for that was because an oppressive might even more powerful than his own had appeared before him.<br>It was a rank four Utmost Exalted&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>Upon looking closely, everyone recognized the identity of the person that appeared.<br>He was the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;You! You&rsquo;re also planning to meddle in other people&rsquo;s business?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the Xuanming Family&rsquo;s family head revealed an even uglier expression.<br>Not only that, but he also began to panic in his heart.<br>The Miao Heavenly Clan had always been stronger than his Xuanming Family. They were an existence that he was unwilling to provoke.<br>&ldquo;My Miao Heavenly Clan has a friendly relationship with the Red-dress Holy Land. I&rsquo;d like to ask you to give this old man face, and not make things difficult for the Red-dress Holy Land.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Else, even if this old man is to meddle in other people&rsquo;s business, you would not be able to stop me,&rdquo; the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the Xuanming Family&rsquo;s family head was so furious that he nearly vomited blood.<br>The front half of that Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s words were rather courteous.<br>However, his closing statement, that &lsquo;you would not be able to stop me,&rsquo; was simply a slap in the face to his Xuanming Family.<br></p></div>
