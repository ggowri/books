        <div> - An Actual Expert<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>"How could this be?!"<br>Seeing that his slaughtering formation was so easily blocked by his opponent's defensive formation, that Starfall Holy Land's disciple immediately started to panic.<br>"It's my turn now."<br>That Nine Profound Sect disciple did not plan to give that Starfall Holy Land disciple the opportunity to turn the situation around. He immediately started to set up a slaughtering formation.<br>The Starfall Holy Land's disciple shouted, "I'm not ready yet!"<br>"If someone begins setting up their spirit formation, you must begin too. Both participants must set up their spirit formations simultaneously; that is the rule. Otherwise, the one to suffer losses will be you," an elder from the Nine Profound Sect said.<br>Under this sort of situation, that Starfall Holy Land's disciple had no other choice but to immediately begin setting up his defensive formation.<br>However, perhaps because his slaughtering formation earlier had exhausted too much of his spirit power, but it was extremely strenuous for him to set up his defensive formation this time around.<br>Soon, an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time had passed. However, that Starfall Holy Land disciple had yet to finish setting up his defensive formation.<br>"Boom~~~"<br>Right at that moment, that Nine Profound Sect disciple had unleashed his slaughtering formation. Not only did the slaughtering formation completely shatter the Starfall Holy Land disciple's incomplete defensive formation, but it also directly landed on his body.<br>Although a slaughtering formation of that degree would not be able to cause any major damage to that Starfall Holy Land disciple, it had managed to smash him into the ground, leaving him in a very sorry state.<br>At that moment, an elder from the Starfall Holy Land shouted angrily, "Useless trash! You dare come out to disgrace yourself with your mere bit of ability? Get the hell back!"<br>After all, this was not only a spar between disciples. At the same time, it was a competition between these different powers.<br>With how miserably that disciple had been defeated, the Starfall Holy Land would naturally feel embarrassed.<br>"Allow me," at that moment, the other male disciple from the Starfall Holy Land stood forth.<br>"What's this, you're planning to challenge me?" The Nine Profound Sect disciple that had just achieved victory looked to the Starfall Holy Land disciple that had just stepped onto the stage with contempt in his eyes.<br>"That's right, I will be the one to challenge you this time around," the Starfall Holy Land disciple said.<br>"Then come at me. After all, the result will be the same," that Nine Profound Sect disciple said with contempt.<br>He was acting as if he already knew how powerful the disciples from the Starfall Holy Land were after the encounter earlier.<br>Thus, he was even more confident this time around. At the same time, he no longer respected his opponent.<br>Soon, the two men started their sparring match. However, this time around, they actually ended up duplicating the result from the last sparring match.<br>That Starfall Holy Land disciple was defeated. He was totally not a match for that Nine Profound Sect disciple.<br>"Forget about it, let me do it," Asura Zhao Kun spoke with a helpless tone.<br>As he spoke, he started to get up unhurriedly.<br>He was planning to act. However, he did not face that Nine Profound Sect disciple head on.<br>While that Nine Profound Sect's disciple did not place the disciples from the Starfall Holy Land in his eyes, Asura Zhao Kun did not place that disciple from the Nine Profound Sect in his eyes either.<br>"You should allow me first."<br>However, before Asura Zhao Kun walked out, a figure flew out first.<br>Seeing that person, the expressions of everyone present changed. Even that male disciple from the Nine Profound Sect that had won against two Starfall Holy Land disciples in succession revealed an enormous change in his expression. There was no longer contempt in his eyes. Instead, it was filled with appreciation.<br>The reason for that was because the person that flew out to face him was none other than the Starfall Holy Land's Holy Daughter, Xia Yun'er.<br>"Allow me to spar with you," Xia Yun'er said with a smile.<br>"Very well. This is truly great. It is my honor to be able to spar with miss Xia," that Nine Profound Sect disciple said with an apologetic smile on his face.<br>He simply did not resemble someone who was facing an opponent. His attitude was extremely good. In fact, it could even be said that he was eagerly attentive.<br>The attitude he had revealed at that moment was simply completely different from before. This caused the two Starfall Holy Land's disciples that were defeated by him earlier to gnash their teeth with anger.<br>It would not be a problem to discriminate in one's treatment toward another. However, this difference in treatment was simply too obvious. This caused them to feel unbearable rage.<br>"I will attack and you defend, what do you think about that?" Xia Yun'er asked with a smile.<br>Her smile was extremely destructive. Seeing that smile, that Nine Profound Sect's disciple's eyes were stunned.<br>"Sure, sure, sure. Let's do as miss Xia suggests."<br>That Nine Profound Sect disciple began to nod his head repeatedly. Seeing his appearance, he simply did not seem to have the mindset of taking this sparring match seriously. It was as if his soul had been snatched away by Xia Yun'er.<br>"In that case, I'll begin now."<br>After saying those words, Xia Yun'er began to set up her spirit formation. That Nine Profound Sect disciple hurriedly started to set up his own spirit formation too.<br>Practically everyone present was looking forward to Xia Yun'er's performance. Thus, all of the spectators became much more serious in their observation of the sparring match. Even Chu Feng was no exception.<br>After all, Xia Yun'er was not an ordinary disciple. Instead, she was the Starfall Holy Land's Holy Daughter, a potential successor to lead the Starfall Holy Land in the future.<br>Finally, an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time had passed. Both Xia Yun'er and that Nine Profound Sect disciple managed to set up their spirit formations.<br>The defensive formation that the Nine Profound Sect disciple set up was still that ordinary-looking spheroid defensive formation.<br>As for Xia Yun'er's slaughtering formation, it also looked very simple. It was a spear. This spear was only ten meters long. Among slaughtering formations, that was most definitely an extremely small sort.<br>"It would appear that it will finally be the Starfall Holy Land's turn to win a match," Chu Feng said.<br>Right at that moment, Xia Yun'er's slaughtering formation shot forth. Her slaughtering formation easily pierced through that Nine Profound Sect disciple's defensive formation.<br>That being said, Xia Yun'er's strength was most definitely not limited to that. After she defeated that Nine Profound Sect disciple, she defeated two more Nine Profound Sect disciples in succession.<br>In other words, although that Nine Profound Sect disciple had managed to defeat two Starfall Holy Land disciples in succession, all three Nine Profound Sect's disciples ended up being defeated by Xia Yun'er.<br>"The Starfall Holy Land's Holy Daughter truly enjoys a well-deserved reputation."<br>At that moment, that silver-haired old man from the Nine Profound Sect started to applaud Xia Yun'er.<br>As for the Starfall Holy Land's elders, they were all smiling happily. Even that Elder Tuoba who was not fond of Xia Yun'er revealed a faint smile on his face.<br>No matter what, Xia Yun'er had managed to save the face of their Starfall Holy Land.<br>"Miss Xia is truly capable. Might miss Xia be willing to accept my challenge?"<br>Right at that moment, of the two women wearing multi-colored skirts, the one with the long blue hair leaped up and landed across from Xia Yun'er.<br>"Of course. I also happen to want to face the experts invited by the Nine Profound Sect myself," Xia Yun'er said with a smile on her face.<br>"Since that's the case, let's have you attack and me defend."<br>As the blue-haired woman spoke, she waved her sleeve and began to set up her defensive formation.<br>"Hey, you're too..."<br>Seeing that blue-haired woman beginning to set up her spirit formation immediately without prior information, the Starfall Holy Land's disciples felt extremely displeased. They opened their mouths and wanted to lash out at that blue-haired woman.<br>However, before they could finish their words, they were astonished to discover that the blue-haired woman had already finished setting up her spirit formation.<br>That's right, she had finished setting up a golden, translucent defensive formation.<br>With a single whip of her sleeve, the blue-haired woman had finished setting up her spirit formation. Furthermore, she did not make any further movement afterwards.<br>"You're planning to use that spirit formation to confront me?" Xia Yun'er asked.<br>"I feel that this defensive formation of mine is sufficient to take on your spear slaughtering formation," the blue-haired woman said with a smile.<br>That woman's words seemed to have angered Xia Yun'er, as she immediately began to set up her slaughtering formation after saying, "Let's give it a try then."<br>However, Xia Yun'er did not start rushing herself just because she was humiliated. Instead, she continued to set up her spirit formation steadily. Like before, she was completely focused. This echoed Xia Yun'er's calm and unflustered nature.<br>Finally, the time limit of an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time had arrived. Xia Yun'er had just finished setting up her spirit formation.<br>"Junior sister, shatter that glass cover of hers! Make her pay for her arrogance!&rdquo; The first male disciple that was defeated from the Starfall Holy Land shouted.<br>"That's right! Junior sister, teach her a lesson!"<br>The other defeated male disciple also shouted.<br>At the same moment when the second male disciple shouted, Xia Yun'er sent forth her spear slaughtering formation.<br>That said, there was a change to Xia Yun'er's current spear slaughtering formation.<br>It did not shoot forth directly. Instead, it started to spin as it shot forward.<br>In the blink of an eye, that spear slaughtering formation had turned into a wind dragon. Its imposing might had increased several-fold.<br>"That girl actually held back her strength earlier."<br>Seeing this scene, not only were the others surprised, but even Her Lady Queen was surprised.<br>Without a doubt, the power of this revolving spear slaughtering formation was definitely much stronger than before.<br>Her Lady Queen was able to notice this, as were the others. As for the two Starfall Holy Land disciples, they were extremely excited.<br>The two of them felt that Xia Yun'er's slaughtering formation was most definitely a top-notch slaughtering formation even among Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists.<br>A slaughtering formation as powerful as that was simply invincible. Thus, they felt that the blue-haired woman invited by the Nine Profound Sect was definitely going to lose.<br>After all, that defensive formation set up by that blue-haired woman was done with merely a wave of her hand. A defensive formation that simple would definitely not possess enormous defensive capabilities.<br>"Clank~~~"<br>However, when Xia Yun'er's spear slaughtering formation came in contact with the blue-haired woman's defensive formation, not only did it stop spinning, but it even stopped emitting any energy ripples at all. It was as if it had been completely fixed to the defensive formation, unable to move in the slightest.<br>"Snap~~~"<br>Immediately afterward, strange sounds were emitted from the spear slaughtering formation. Upon careful inspection, cracks had started forming. Those were actually cracking sounds.<br>"Crack, crack~~~"<br>Suddenly, the spear slaughtering formation turned into countless fragments. Like shattered glass, the fragments scattered all over the ground.<br>At that moment, the people of the older generation present were still composed. However, those from the younger generation were all stunned.<br>Even Chu Feng now looked to that blue-haired woman with a more serious gaze.<br>That blue-haired woman was even more powerful than Chu Feng had imagined.<br>She was... an actual expert.<br><br><br></p></div>
