        <h1>Chapter 5301</h1>
        <div>: A Mere Pill Refinement Sect Dares to Use the Word &lsquo;Immortal&rsquo;?<br>&ldquo;That grayish-black aura feels sinister. What is it?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was unnerved by the tremendous pressure exerted by the grayish-black aura, not to mention that the aura appeared to rival the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect. It left them wondering which power could have been behind the grayish-black aura.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Bloodline Galaxy&rsquo;s Bluemoon Sacred Palace,&rdquo; an elderly voice echoed from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s war chariot.<br>&ldquo;The Bluemoon Sacred Palace&hellip; Is it the power that&rsquo;s second only to the Demon Morph Clan?&rdquo;<br>The crowd&rsquo;s unease began morphing into fear. Chu Feng noticed that both juniors and elders alike had turned completely pale, as if disaster was going to soon befall them. It wasn&rsquo;t that surprising since the Bluemoon Sacred Palace was notorious in the world of cultivation as a demonic power.<br>Boom!<br>Deafening rumbles roared in the sky as the two powers clashed with each other.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re fighting! Someone from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect charged at the Bluemoon Sacred Palace!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Good and evil cannot co-exist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As expected of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect. They wouldn&rsquo;t overlook the presence of demonic powers before them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Kill those people from the Bluemoon Sacred Palace! They aren&rsquo;t worthy of entering the Ancient Realm! Kick them out of our Totem Galaxy!&rdquo;<br>Many people in the crowd cheered for the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect in hopes that they would eradicate the Bluemoon Sacred Palace. It was not that they hated the Bluemoon Sacred Palace but that they were simply frightened of them.<br>&ldquo;How interesting! It&rsquo;s nothing compared to the battle between the demon monk and the Totem Dragon Clan, but it&rsquo;s still a sight to behold. There are indeed many formidable experts in the vast world of cultivation!&rdquo; Eggy exclaimed as she admired the battle between the two experts.<br>None of the cultivators could see the battle; they could only feel the terrifying shockwaves behind their clashes. Nevertheless, the overwhelming prowess exerted by both sides shook their hearts.<br>&ldquo;You seem to be getting excited by their fight, Chu Feng,&rdquo; Eggy remarked in surprise.<br>&ldquo;I am excited. This fight reminds me of how weak I still am. It stokes my desire to become stronger. One day, my attacks shall raise such shockwaves too,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I would expect no less from you,&rdquo; Eggy said with a smile.<br>Chu Feng suddenly noticed something in his peripheral vision. He turned his head over to take a closer look, and he saw the white-haired woman who gave him his invitation letter. Much to his astonishment, the white-haired woman seemed to be looking at him too.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, she seems to be able to see me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He was still in concealment, but for some reason, the white-haired woman was staring at him.<br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s definitely looking at you. It looks like she isn&rsquo;t an ordinary cultivator,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll head over.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng made his way over to the white-haired woman&rsquo;s side and said, &ldquo;Young miss, you&rsquo;re here too.&rdquo;<br>The white-haired woman didn&rsquo;t pay him any heed. Instead, she cast her gaze elsewhere as if she was searching for someone.<br>&ldquo;Stop acting. I know that you can see me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>The white-haired woman frowned. She finally gave up on her pretense and turned to Chu Feng, asking, &ldquo;Are you a fugitive? Why are you hiding?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have many enemies,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;What kind of enemies would an outsider like you have?&rdquo; The white-haired woman expressed her skepticism.<br>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m the kind of person who can&rsquo;t stand injustice. It can&rsquo;t be helped that I&rsquo;d offend some people along the way. Over time, I find myself with more and more enemies,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied jokingly, hoping to lighten the mood.<br>However, the white-haired woman went completely silent instead. She didn&rsquo;t seem to be receptive to jokes.<br>Thus, Chu Feng reverted to his serious attitude and asked, &ldquo;I am Chu Feng. May I know how I should address you?&rdquo;<br>The white-haired woman didn&rsquo;t answer. Her eyes were fixated on the ongoing fight in the sky.<br>Chu Feng noticed that the white-haired woman was particular about revealing her own name, so he didn&rsquo;t probe deeper into it. He also turned his attention toward the fight in the sky too.<br>&ldquo;I wonder what the Bluemoon Sacred Palace has done to garner that much hatred,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked.<br>&ldquo;The Bluemoon Sacred Palace is a bunch of deranged dogs. It&rsquo;s not without reason they are one of the scariest powers in the Bloodline Galaxy, and they have grown increasingly active after the disappearance of the Demon Morph Clan. They haven&rsquo;t stooped to the level of using other cultivators as fodder for their cultivation, but those who offended them are sure to suffer the consequences of their actions.<br>&ldquo;Many people have heard of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace, but few have met them in person. That might have contributed to widespread fear for them. However, you need not worry too much about it. While the Bluemoon Sacred Palace aren&rsquo;t saints, they wouldn&rsquo;t attack a person without reason either,&rdquo; the white-haired woman said.<br>&ldquo;Thanks for enlightening me, young miss. You sure know a lot,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>The white-haired woman didn&rsquo;t respond.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, has the Ancient Realm invited such powers over before?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;They did, but they have never invited such a prominent power before,&rdquo; the white-haired woman replied.<br>&ldquo;Does the Totem Dragon Clan not care about this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The Ancient Realm doesn&rsquo;t collude with any powers, so the Totem Dragon Clan turns a blind eye to their actions. Besides, if the other powers were really up to something, they could have snuck into the Totem Galaxy even if they didn&rsquo;t have the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s Invitation Letter,&rdquo; the white-haired woman replied.<br>&ldquo;That makes sense,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.<br>He was getting more and more convinced that the white-haired woman was no ordinary person. Despite her young age, she knew much more than most people present here.<br>&ldquo;Why did they stop fighting?&rdquo; an uneasy voice sounded from the crowd.<br>The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect and the Bluemoon Sacred Palace had stopped exchanging blows.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re equally matched. Continuing the fight would only cause huge casualties to both sides. There&rsquo;s no reason for them to go to that extent since there isn&rsquo;t any deep grudge between them,&rdquo; an elderly voice echoed from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s war chariot.<br>At the same time, an elder stepped out of the war chariot. He was dressed in the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s robes, and his long white hair that flowed down to his feet fluttered with the wind. It was a mysteriously beautiful sight.<br>The elder&rsquo;s face was wrinkled, but he had a pair of clear eyes. There wasn&rsquo;t the slightest fluctuation in his eyes even as he gazed at the two powerhouses. This showed that he was someone who had weathered storms.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Lord Wuxiang!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to Lord Wuxiang!&rdquo;<br>Many people in the crowd quickly bowed to the elder.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured. You&rsquo;re stepping on the soil of our Totem Galaxy. No one will dare to touch you as long as the Pill Dao Immortal Sect is here!&rdquo; Lord Wuxiang gazed at the crowd below with a benevolent smile.<br>The crowd was deeply reassured to hear those words.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Wuxiang.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t fear anyone as long as you&rsquo;re here!&rdquo;<br>Words of gratitude filled the air.<br>Meanwhile, the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect and Bluemoon Sacred Palace made their way toward the wooden gate. The entire sky was split between the golden light and the grayish-black aura. Even those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect were enveloped by them.<br>It was almost as if they were superior beings towering over everyone else.<br>Those beneath couldn&rsquo;t see anything other than the blinding golden light and the grayish-black aura. Those from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect and Bluemoon Sacred Palace had no intention of showing themselves.<br>This was an act of contempt toward those from the Totem Galaxy.<br>Shoosh!<br>Lord Wuxiang ascended to the sky and made his way toward the golden light and the grayish-black aura.<br>Weng!<br>He was blocked by a powerful force before he could even get close. Undeterred, he shouted out, &ldquo;I am Mo Wuxiang, an elder from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. I don&rsquo;t bear any ill-will. I simply wish to represent our Totem Galaxy to welcome our friends from afar.&rdquo;<br>Lord Wuxiang bowed politely toward the golden light and the grayish-black aura.<br>The crowd, who were still impressed by him just a moment ago, fell speechless.<br>What happened next utterly humiliated Lord Wuxiang.<br>&ldquo;Those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect dares to represent the Totem Galaxy? Hah! Why don&rsquo;t you change the name of this galaxy to Pill Dao Galaxy before spouting such nonsense?&rdquo;<br>A shrill peal of laughter echoed from the grayish-black aura. More and more people joined in, be it men, women, elders, or juniors. Even those from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect began laughing as well.<br>The faces of Lord Wuxiang and those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect turned awful. It was just a moment ago that Lord Wuxiang declared that he would protect everyone, only to be snubbed by the two powerhouses. Even so, none of them dared to utter a word of complaint.<br>They didn&rsquo;t dare to offend the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect and the Bluemoon Sacred Palace.<br>&ldquo;A mere pill refinement sect dares to use the word &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;?&rdquo; A woman&rsquo;s voice could be heard from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect. &ldquo;A bunch of bumpkins has the cheek to pass off as immortals. How crude.&rdquo;<br></div>
