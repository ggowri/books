        <div>: Secrets About the Ancestral Martial Galaxy<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Young master Feng, the old man who was with Chu Feng seems to have gone missing.&rdquo;<br>Elder Xuan also noticed that Lord Bai didn&rsquo;t return to the real world together with Chu Feng and the others.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that the old man is the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal?&rdquo;<br>That was the first thought that occurred to young master Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem likely for him to suddenly vanish into thin air. Even if he isn&rsquo;t the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal, he&rsquo;s bound to be someone formidable. Even I was unable to discern anything amiss about him,&rdquo; Elder Xuan remarked.<br>There were far too many powers from the Ancestral Martial Starfield gathered here, so Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t want to talk too much here. He gathered those whom he was close with and left the area together with them.<br>Of course, he brought those who were previously trapped in the Darknight Sacred River with him away as well. He was planning to ask them about Lord Bai.<br>Others might have suspected that a mishap had befallen Lord Bai, but it didn&rsquo;t make sense that everyone else was safe other than him. Given that, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder if there was more to Lord Bai than what he had seen thus far.<br>Based on the statements from the crowd, Chu Feng learned that Lord Bai had entered the Darknight Sacred River 15,000 years ago. He was still a young man back then. His original name was Bai Xiu, and he was neither strong nor talented.<br>As a result, he was nothing but an insignificant character in the Darknight Sacred River, and no one paid him any heed at the very start.<br>However, it didn&rsquo;t take long for the others to realize that this inconspicuous young man had an exceptional talent when it came to the cultivation of Demonsoul Grass. The effectiveness of the Demonsoul Grass he cultivated was much more potent than the others.<br>It turned out that his clan used to specialize in cultivating special crops, and he had developed a special medicine of his own that enhanced crop growth. It was out of curiosity that he tried the special medicine on the Demonsoul Grass, but it was surprisingly effective too.<br>The others began using the special medicine in the cultivation of the Demonsoul Grass too, and the effects were indeed outstanding. That helped Lord Bai to rise through the ranks despite his lack of talent as a cultivator.<br>The crowd later discovered that Lord Bai was actually a star of fortune. Often, he would uncover special treasures that significantly enhanced everyone&rsquo;s quality of life. Life had gotten much more comfortable in the Darknight Sacred River ever since Lord Bai&rsquo;s arrival.<br>That was also why everyone was so respectful to Lord Bai, even addressing him as &lsquo;Lord Bai&rsquo;. Even the past rulers of the city would take a respectful attitude toward him.<br>Lord Yuwei also had some stories to share about Lord Bai, and one of them astonished Chu Feng.<br>The secret skill that she had used against the guards was known as &lsquo;Heavenly Dance of the Phoenixes&rsquo;. This skill was uncovered by Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandmother in an ancient remnant. She thought that Lord Yuwei was suited for it, so she gave it to her.<br>While Heavenly Dance of the Phoenixes was a powerful secret skill, it wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be that formidable. The only reason she was able to ward off the stronger leader of the guards with it was due to a fortuitous encounter she had stumbled on.<br>It was a tattered talisman that possessed the incredible effect of empowering a secret skill when fused with it. It was a gift from Lord Bai.<br>According to Lord Bai, he dug it out of the ground while cultivating Demonsoul Grass. He didn&rsquo;t know what it was, so he handed it over to Lord Yuwei. Lord Yuwei was able to tell at a glance how powerful the talisman was, so she told Lord Bai about its effects and refused his goodwill.<br>She didn&rsquo;t think that it was right for her to accept such an invaluable treasure. Countless cultivators would murder just to lay their hands on it.<br>Yet, Lord Bai said that he had no use for the talisman due to his limited cultivation, so he insisted on gifting it to Lord Yuwei. Under his persistence, Lord Yuwei eventually accepted the talisman, and she used it to enhance her secret skill. That was why she was able to fend offthe leader of the guards despite being a cultivation rank weaker.<br>It was in a peaceful and enclosed environment that Lord Yuwei and Chu Feng had this conversation, but they didn&rsquo;t know that there were people observing them even though Chu Feng had already set up a voice isolation barrier.<br>These people were none other than the red-<br>men.<br>They saw that Chu Feng was also suspecting Lord Bai, just like them, so they followed him hoping to gather some information. That allowed them to grasp hold of the information Chu Feng had uncovered.<br>&ldquo;It looks like the cultivator named Bai Xiu is indeed the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal. There is no mistake about that,&rdquo; Elder Xuan spoke affirmatively.<br>&ldquo;Elder Xuan, how can you be so sure about that?&rdquo;<br>Young master Feng still harbored some doubts.<br>&ldquo;Young master Feng, I can confirm that from the talisman paper that enhances secret skills. Based on what I&rsquo;ve heard, the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal has received an Immemorial Era&rsquo;s heritage that includes a talisman that enhances secret skill. Admittedly, it&rsquo;s just a rumor and the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal has never acknowledged it, but I think it&rsquo;s far too much to shrug it off as a mere coincidence here.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal having a grudge against the Night Monarch, so his goal for entering the Darknight Sacred River and lying low for 15,000 years is unlikely to be for vengeance. The Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal was known to be a principled man too, so I don&rsquo;t think that he would collude with the likes of the Night Monarch. What could his goal be?&rdquo; Elder Xuan said.<br>&ldquo;Is it possible that the Night Monarch and the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal had a grudge that we&rsquo;re unaware of?&rdquo; a red-<br>man asked.<br>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t exclude that possibility. The Night Monarch has done much evil in hislifetime and made many enemies. It&rsquo;s possible that it might have hurt the friends of the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal.<br>&ldquo;However, if that was the case, the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal could have simply eliminated the Night Monarch while he was in deep sleep, but he didn&rsquo;t do so. Instead, he swiped away the Night Monarch&rsquo;s carcass after we killed it.<br>&ldquo;To be frank, I have a bold guess regarding this matter,&rdquo; Elder Xuan said.<br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;<br>Young master Feng and the other red-<br>men looked at Elder Xuan with eyes filled with curiosity.<br>&ldquo;The Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal knew that the Night Monarch was in a weakened state and required a steady supply of Demonsoul Grass over a long period of time to recuperate. There&rsquo;s a chance that the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal might have tampered with the Demonsoul Grass&hellip; possibly with the intent to control the Night Monarch,&rdquo; Elder Xuan said.<br>While it was only a guess at this point, it did fit perfectly in the story.<br>&ldquo;What Elder Xuan said makes sense. I&rsquo;ve heard that the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal is in possession of some kind of means that allows him to control other beings. It wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to control the powerful Night Monarch under normal circumstances, but by slowly spiking his medicine while the latter was in hibernation, it might just be possible for him to turn the Night Monarch into his puppet.<br>&ldquo;It would be worthwhile for the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal to go to such lengths if he could acquire a puppet as powerful as the Night Monarch. After all, who could resist the allure of having a powerful aide?&rdquo; the middle-aged man said.<br>The others nodded in agreement.<br>&ldquo;To be honest, I already sensed that something was amiss while I was killing the Night Monarch. I had a feeling that the Night Monarch wasn&rsquo;t dead yet, and what I killed was a mere shell. It was due to this feeling I had that I took away the formation linked to the Night Monarch&rsquo;s life away with me. Looking at it now, I think that there&rsquo;s a good chance that the Night Monarch is still alive,&rdquo; Elder Xuan said.<br>&ldquo;What Elder Xuan said makes sense. The Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal wouldn&rsquo;t do this for no reason. Based on what he has done so far, the most plausible explanation is that he&rsquo;s trying to control the Night Monarch while the latter was in hibernation.<br>&ldquo;However, what surprises me the most is still the Nine Dragon Upper Realm&rsquo;s Peach GardenImmortal. It&rsquo;s actually him!&rdquo;<br>Young master Feng&rsquo;s voice sounded a little worried. The other red-<br>men also looked a little nervous.<br>&ldquo;The Peach GardenImmortal is indeed much more dangerous than the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal and the Night Monarch.<br>&ldquo;Young master Feng, the figures who have emerged from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy are no longer within our means to deal with. I suggest that we make a temporary retreat from here and carefully go through our plans once more,&rdquo; Elder Xuan said.<br>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;<br>Young master Feng agreed with Elder Xuan&rsquo;s words with a nod.<br>He knew that they could no longer do as they pleased now that the heavyweight players had appeared. At the very least, they would require reinforcements.<br>However, young master Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a little confused.<br>&ldquo;Elder Xuan, there must be a reason why so many experts from the Ancient Era have chosen to hide here, right? What kind of secrets are hidden in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Ancestral Martial Galaxy have reached unprecedented heights of greatness and prosperity in the Ancient Era and the early years of the current era. It&rsquo;s a mystical land filled with many secrets that lie beyond my knowledge. If I really have to put it out in words&hellip; this is a place where the strongest experts are born,&rdquo; Elder Xuan said.<br>&ldquo;A place where the strongest experts are born? It looks like it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the Ancestral Martial Galaxy shakes the world of cultivation at its core.&rdquo;<br>Young master Feng shot a glance at Chu Feng before leaving the area. Elder Xuan and the other red-<br>men quickly followed suit, though they couldn&rsquo;t resist directing one last glance at Chu Feng.<br>They could have simply shrugged Chu Feng off as a stranger to them in the past, but things were different now. After all, he had saved all of their lives.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng was able to confirm that Lord Bai was still alive and was likely from an extraordinary background, and this wasn&rsquo;t just based on Lord Yuwei&rsquo;s statements. Just a moment ago, he took a look at his own dantian and saw a talisman lying there.<br></p></div>
