        <h1>Chapter 5717: Treatment Failure</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Lin could hardly believe his ears. Was Chu Feng really telling him to go faster?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He examined Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression and saw that the latter was no longer frowning. The latter had gotten used to the pain. Perplexed, he turned to the dragon essence to check if there was a problem with it, but it was still vicious, domineering, and cruel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that Chu Feng was the issue here. His ability to adapt was frightening!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re truly special,&rdquo; Long Lin said with a laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The compass wouldn&rsquo;t have chosen me otherwise. Elder, let&rsquo;s speed things up,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Lin never thought that someone could smile while taking in the dragon essence. In fact, he hadn&rsquo;t seen anyone who was able to talk after taking in the dragon essence. They would usually wail in agony till they ran out of strength, and that was including him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was inconceivable to him how Chu Feng was taking it so well, but this was good news. Thus, he sped things up as Chu Feng had requested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s face distorted, but he didn&rsquo;t let out a cry. He held himself together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;As expected of Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; Long Lin complimented with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, you have never met my mother before, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As great as his mother&rsquo;s reputation was, Long Lin should have already been trapped in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm by the time she was active in the world of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I have never met her before, but I heard about her affairs. Your feats don&rsquo;t pale in comparison to hers,&rdquo; Long Lin remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t compete with my mother, but I won&rsquo;t embarrass her either,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the two of them spoke, the terrifying dragon essence fully seeped into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How are you feeling, Chu Feng?&rdquo; Long Lin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was nervous despite being a powerhouse who overthrew the previous Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief; he was afraid of failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I need time to nurture the dragon essence, but it should be fine otherwise,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; Long Lin excitedly clenched his fist, as he saw hope for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, am I allowed to freely move around this area?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Feel free to go wherever you want, as long as it isn&rsquo;t locked off by a formation,&rdquo; Long Lin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Lin brought Chu Feng to a palace for him to rest in before taking his leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Long Lin was gone, the Heaven-devouring Qilin said, &ldquo;Little Feng, you aren&rsquo;t that foolish as to stay here, are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You already have the dragon essence in hand. Give it to me, and I can turn it into energy and raise your cultivation,&rdquo; the Heaven-devouring Qilin replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;So, the item you&rsquo;re sensing is the dragon essence?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Not exactly. I can sense something stronger than that here. That fellow is hiding something. I&rsquo;m guessing that the remains of the ancestral dragon he spoke about aren&rsquo;t as simple as he put it out to be. But&hellip; do you think you&rsquo;ll be able to get to it?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you able to point out the exact location?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I suspect there&rsquo;s a powerful formation sealing it off. I can&rsquo;t tell the exact location either.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How am I supposed to find it when you can&rsquo;t figure out the location? I can&rsquo;t possibly ask him where the remains of the ancestral dragon are, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You can just tell him that you have a hunch that you can better nurture the dragon essence if you&rsquo;re closer to the remains of the ancestral dragon. Are you so naive that you can&rsquo;t even lie? He&rsquo;s desperate to save that old woman anyway. He&rsquo;ll give it a try even if he doubts your words,&rdquo; the Heaven-devouring Qilin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Forget it. He doesn&rsquo;t trust me that much,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng could give it a try, but he held himself back, knowing the remains of the ancestral dragon was important to the Totem Dragon Clan. Long Chengyu and the others likely thought of it as their ancestor. His conscience would ache if he fed it to the Heaven-devouring Qilin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as good as digging his brother&rsquo;s grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right to say he doesn&rsquo;t trust you much. His words sound nice, but no one becomes a galaxy overlord by being a saint. He definitely has his means. Since you feel that something is amiss, Little Feng, who don&rsquo;t we make our escape? You already have the dragon essence in hand anyway. Feed it to me, and I&rsquo;ll at least help you reach the rank four Half-God level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;As for those friends, you won&rsquo;t be able to save them. Why would he stop you from meeting them if he intends to free them in the first place? Heed my words. You are a talented man, but you are still weak at the moment. It&rsquo;s best for you not to get involved in such matters, and it&rsquo;s not as if you can really do anything to help either. You should prioritize yourself, understand?&rdquo; the Heaven-devouring Qilin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You need not persuade me. I have my own plan,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn&rsquo;t possibly leave by himself when he had finally found Long Chengyu and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the days to come, Chu Feng realized that the area was filled with formations, and Long Lin had been observing him from the shadows. There was nowhere he could go, and he dared not to pull off anything either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the bright side, while nurturing the dragon essence was painful, he was able to quickly adapt to it such that it didn&rsquo;t hinder him from doing what he wanted to. Thus, he began looking into the God Taboo Martial Skill, Dragon Breath. He soon realized that it was possible for him to cultivate it at his current cultivation level, though it would be extremely tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a month passed since he took in the dragon essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng stood on an empty plot of land, and not too far away was a formation stone monument that he had constructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, he opened his mouth and released a powerful burst of martial power in the form of a golden light toward the formation stone monument. The golden light looked formidable, but it was unable to shake the formation stone monument in the least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Haa! It doesn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo; Chu Feng was disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he had executed earlier was the God Taboo Martial Skill he had received from Long Lin, Dragon Breath. He had grasped the basic idea of it, but its prowess wasn&rsquo;t satisfactory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scroll mentioned that Dragon Breath was a powerful God Taboo capable of unleashing prowess comparable to a rank two God Taboo when mastered, but Chu Feng&rsquo;s experience with it showed that its prowess was beneath that of a rank nine Exalted Taboo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had cultivated the God Taboo in accordance with the scroll, so he had no idea where he had erred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spent the next few days thinking about where he had gone wrong, while spending time thinking about what kind of formation he should construct to better draw out the effects of the Seven Realms Soul Forging Incense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn&rsquo;t figure out the problem behind Dragon Breath, but he did think of a formation to best amplify the effect of the Seven Realms Soul Forging Incense. He </span><span>quickly got to action, but to his dismay, Eggy showed no signs of recovery even after the entire incense burned out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why would this be so?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart fell into despair.</span></p></div>
