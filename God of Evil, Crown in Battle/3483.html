        <h1>Chapter 3482</h1>
        <div> - The Might Of The Strongest Genius<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Linghu Hongfei?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why would he be here? Didn&rsquo;t he declare that he wouldn&rsquo;t participate in this year&rsquo;s selection?&rdquo;<br>No one had expected Linghu Hongfei to come. His arrival brought the crowd an enormous yet pleasant surprise.<br>After all, Linghu Hongfei was the publicly accepted number one genius of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>A selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars without him would simply be incomplete.<br>Not to mention seeing him fight, even just seeing him was something that many people yearned for. This was especially true for the people of the younger generation. Among the younger generations, the women were the most excited.<br>Which woman wouldn&rsquo;t want to find the most outstanding man in the world to protect her?<br>Without a doubt, Linghu Hongfei was the partner that they dreamed of. Unfortunately, he stood too high. They knew that they would not be able to match up to him. That said, this did not decrease their admiration and adoration for him.<br>&ldquo;Linghu Hongfei, it would appear that you&rsquo;ve had a change of heart?&rdquo; Wuming Ken asked.<br>&ldquo;This junior had encountered some troubles before. Because of that, I was unable to come to participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars in time. I didn&rsquo;t wish for everyone to delay the selection because of this junior, and renounced my participation because of that. But this junior has just managed a recovery this evening, and immediately rushed over. I hope that milord can give this junior an opportunity to participate in the selection,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei clasped his fist. His attitude was very humble. Although he spoke forcefully with conviction, he did not lose his manners, and also did not lose his proud demeanor.<br>Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s behavior not only infatuated the people of the younger generation, but it was even met with non stop praise from the older generation.<br>&ldquo;In that case, your health is fine now?&rdquo; Wuming Ken asked.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for your concern, milord. This junior has indeed recovered,&rdquo; answered Linghu Hongfei.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. After all, you are the future pillar of our Ancestral Martial Starfield. If something is to happen to you, it would not be good for our Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for whether or not you can participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars, this old man is unable to make the decision. I will have to discuss it with milord.&rdquo;<br>After Wuming Ken finished saying those words, he flew toward the leading Starfield Master Realm&rsquo;s war chariot.<br>No one knew who or what was inside that war chariot. However, without a doubt, it most definitely held the grand characters of the Starfield Master Realm. It would even be possible for there to be Utmost Exalted-level experts inside.<br>Not long afterward, Wuming Ken flew back from the war chariot and returned to where he had previously stood.<br>&ldquo;Linghu Hongfei, milord has agreed to make an exception for you today to join the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars,&rdquo; he said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you milord,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei clasped his fist to express his thanks. Although he was smiling, he was not acting ecstatic. It would appear that he was certain that he would obtain such a result.<br>In fact, it was not only Linghu Hongfei who was certain. Many people present all felt that as long as Linghu Hongfei wished to participate, he would definitely be allowed to do so.<br>After all, he was the publicly accepted strongest genius. Even if he didn&rsquo;t participate in the selection, people would still consider him to be the strongest genius.<br>Instead, a selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars without him would be less impactful.<br>Should Linghu Hongfei be a participant, the rankings of the Ancestral Martial Decastars would become proper again. Thus, even if it was to make an exception, the Starfield Master Realm would still allow him to participate.<br>Suddenly, Wuming Ken added, &ldquo;However, there is a condition.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What condition is there? Senior, please speak away,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei replied calmly.<br>&ldquo;For the sake of convincing the masses, you are not allowed to take a hidden path. Instead, you must take the open path. If you are able to reach the other side through the open path, I believe that no one will be unconvinced. At that time&hellip; you can challenge any one of those ten. Should you win, you will be able to participate in the selection,&rdquo; Wuming Ken said.<br>&ldquo;Take the open path? That condition is simply too difficult, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. After all, there are Exalted-level Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts in there.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible. However&hellip; if it&rsquo;s Linghu Hongfei, it might be possible.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, many people felt that the condition was excessively harsh. However, there were also people that felt that Linghu Hongfei might be able to accomplish what was impossible for others.<br>After all, his strength far surpassed that of the other younger generations. Otherwise&hellip; he wouldn&rsquo;t possibly possess such enormous fame.<br>What were demon-level geniuses? Linghu Hongfei was what an actual demon-level genius would be.<br>What were geniuses? Before Linghu Hongfei, others could not be considered geniuses at all.<br>&ldquo;Very well, this junior is willing to accept the condition,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei accepted the condition decisively.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s body shifted. He directly arrived on the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound and walked in through the Giant Cosmos Bell&rsquo;s entrance.<br>The moment Linghu Hongfei flew through the gate, the crowd all became incomparably curious.<br>Unfortunately, they were unable to see through the Giant Cosmos Bell. As such, they were unable to see what the situation inside was like.<br>Seemingly knowing what the crowd were thinking, Wuming Ken formed hand seals with both hands while chanting. Then, he pointed his right hand at the Giant Cosmos Bell and shouted, &ldquo;Open!&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, the bright Giant Cosmos Bell became transparent.<br>At this moment, the crowd were all able to see the situation inside the Giant Cosmos Bell without using any sort of special ability.<br>There were many paths inside the Giant Cosmos Bell that could lead to the exit.<br>Those paths were all very complicated. The reason for that was because one could use those paths to avoid the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts.<br>However, there was a path among them that shot straight ahead. That path was the closest and fastest way to the exit. However, it was also the most dangerous path, as it was practically crowded with ferocious beasts.<br>That said, that path just so happened to be the one chosen by Linghu Hongfei. Linghu Hongfei had decided to take the most dangerous path.<br>Some of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts would shake mountains as they galloped on the ground. Others could rip apart space itself as they flew through the skies.<br>They were not monstrous beasts that possessed intelligence. Instead, they were ferocious beasts with slaughter as their nature.<br>There were even Exalted-level existences among the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts in there.<br>However, although he was in such a dangerous place, Linghu Hongfei was not only calm, but he also remained as graceful as ever.<br>He held a sword in his hand, and flew straight ahead.<br>As his hand moved sliced the air, many sword rays swept forth from his sword.<br>The sword rays took the form of crescents, and continued to expand in size. The largest among them reached over a thousand meters.<br>The places where the sword rays swept past were completely cleared. Not to mention those Martial Immortal-level Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts, even the Exalted-level Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts were sliced in half by the sword rays. They were simply incapable of contending against Linghu Hongfei.<br>Most shocking of all, the sword in Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s hand was not some sort of treasured weapon. Instead, it was only an ordinary iron sword.<br>An iron sword like that could even be shattered by a relatively tough rock.<br>Yet, in Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s hand, that iron sword turned into a sharp weapon capable of easily killing Exalted-level Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts.<br>The reason why such a thing was possible was due to Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>Rank two Exalted. That was his current strength,<br>Tang Zhenghao, a fellow member of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, was still only a Heavenly Immortal. Even Linghu Yueyue was only a Martial Immortal. Furthermore, she was quite some distance from becoming a peak Martial Immortal.<br>Yet, Linghu Hongfei had already reached the Exalted realm. Furthermore, it was rank two Exalted on top of that.<br>That was Linghu Hongfei.<br>&ldquo;So powerful! No wonder he&rsquo;s the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s strongest genius.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With him here, all other geniuses will be eclipsed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Marvelous. Sure enough, the Ancestral Martial Decastars with Linghu Hongfei is the actual Ancestral Martial Decastars.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is there even a need for this competition? How could anyone possibly compete against him? There&rsquo;s simply no need for a competition at all, the first place of the Ancestral Martial Decastars is destined to belong to Linghu Hongfei.&rdquo;<br>Not only were the people of the younger generation completely stunned, even those from the older generation were praising Linghu Hongfei nonstop.<br>Although he was very young, his talent was truly heaven-defying. It was not only the people of the younger generation that would not be able to compare to him. Even many of those from the older generation that had trained for several thousand years found themselves inferior by comparison.<br>Seeing Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s performance, even Chu Feng started to frown.<br>Chu Feng had come to participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars with a very clear goal in mind - obtaining first place.<br>However, with Linghu Hongfei as his opponent, how exactly was he supposed to deal with him?<br></p></div>
