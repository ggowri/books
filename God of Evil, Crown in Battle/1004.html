        <h1>Chapter 1004</h1>
        <div> - Chu Feng's Resolution<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>After Chu Kongtong left, the land returned to its original state. Completely pitch-black darkness; only the pile of firewood emitted a faint light, brightening up a small area.<br>*hmm* Chu Xuanyuan raised his hand slightly and repaired the broken coffin. The overturned grave also returned to its perfect state.<br>&ldquo;Old Ape, sorry for the trouble,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said with an apologetic tone as he looked at it.<br>&ldquo;Xuanyuan, you&rsquo;re still being so formal with me? It&rsquo;s just a small thing. If it can motivate Chu Feng, then so what if I was wronged even more?&rdquo; said the old ape at ease. It was entirely willing to go through all that.<br>&ldquo;Old Ape, I&rsquo;m not talking about that. It&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; As Chu Xuanyuan looked at the old ape who looked as if it was about to die, the sorrow and self-blame increased in his eyes. He knew very well what sort of powerful existence the old ape was before.<br>&ldquo;Ahh, I&rsquo;m willing to do all of this. Besides, for things like cultivation, if it can be taken away, it can be taken back. Right now, I&rsquo;ve just fallen slightly. Sooner or later, I can regain it all.&rdquo; The old ape faintly smiled, then said, &ldquo;Actually, Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent is truly not bad. It&rsquo;s already quite unbelievable that he has this cultivation in the Eastern Sea Region that lacks cultivation resources greatly. Besides, you did some things to his bloodline.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The suffering he&rsquo;s getting in cultivation right now isn&rsquo;t much, but it can lay a very good foundation for his future. But to be honest, Feng&rsquo;er&rsquo;s growth is better than I expected. Not only in terms of cultivation, but also in terms of a person.<br>&ldquo;In all these years, I haven&rsquo;t been able to stay by his side to protect him, look after him, or lead him.<br>&ldquo;What I worry the most wasn&rsquo;t how much his cultivation could be raised, but his character.<br>&ldquo;Right now, my worries have vanished because his nature has been set. He&rsquo;s a very spirited man. I feel very relieved knowing just that.&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan smiled with an eased face.<br>&ldquo;The reason Chu Feng has such a firm nature must be because he has a father like you, right? After all, he&rsquo;s your son.<br>&ldquo;But right now, Chu Feng&rsquo;s entered the Holy Land of Martialism. He, with that cultivation, is like a little fish that entered a vast ocean. Even if his aptitude is extraordinary and has a bloodline that surpasses all others, he hasn&rsquo;t grown yet.<br>&ldquo;At that place, all sorts of accidents can happen. As a father, are you not worried at all?&rdquo; asked the old ape.<br>&ldquo;I am. How could I<br>not<br>be worried? But what can I do about that? I can&rsquo;t have him stay here and make him a useless person, then have him die from age, right? Rather than that, why not just let him go? At least, he&rsquo;ll still be able to see the exciting world outside,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said very helplessly.<br>&ldquo;Actually, what I&rsquo;m worried the most really aren&rsquo;t outsiders but instead the ones from the Chu family. Although they basically won&rsquo;t interfere with this world, they have still sent people to monitor it.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done a few things with Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline, so the power he grasps will look different from your Chu family&rsquo;s bloodline. Although it&rsquo;ll look different, there will always be similarities.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng isn&rsquo;t bound by this place. As long as he safely develops, sooner or later his name will spread throughout this world. If those who have some conflicts with your Chu family hear of his accomplishments, suspicions will unavoidably arise.<br>&ldquo;So, that was why I urged you to change Chu Feng&rsquo;s name when you had that person from the Eastern Sea Region take him away,&rdquo; said the old ape.<br>&ldquo;No matter how the Chu family&rsquo;s treated me, we are still a member. The surname cannot be changed.<br>&ldquo;As for his name itself, his mother chose it, so that absolutely cannot be changed.<br>&ldquo;Besides, this world is big. There are countless people with the same name. If Feng&rsquo;er truly falls to a disaster because of his name alone, then it can only be said to be fate.<br>&ldquo;The road of cultivation has never been an easy path. As his father, I will definitely worry for his safety. I don&rsquo;t want him to receive any harm, and I hope that he can be away from danger.<br>&ldquo;However, for his future, I won&rsquo;t protect him. I actually hope that he can face some perils alone.<br>&ldquo;There are some things that should be personally experienced, such as tribulations. Experience is something even more precious than cultivation resources.<br>&ldquo;Which famous expert in this world hasn&rsquo;t gone through a million troubles and passed through the gates of hell countless times?<br>&ldquo;In comparison to the Outer World, this world is simply like a greenhouse. If I, Chu Xuanyuan, have a son who can&rsquo;t even develop within a place like this, then that only means he is unworthy to be my son.&rdquo; The fatherly benevolence in Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s eyes vanished, and replacing it was a hint of fierceness&mdash;ruthless fierceness.<br>&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo; The old ape didn&rsquo;t say anything more. It heaved a long sigh as it felt complicated emotions.<br>At the same time, Chu Feng had awoken. He discovered he had left the coffin and entered a tunnel.<br>Inside the tunnel, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body lost control. He could only go along with the flow and go forth with an indescribable quick speed.<br>He knew he had gone into the correct path.<br>This<br>tunnel was the true Heavenly Road, the true path that led to the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>But at that instant, Chu Feng felt extremely complicated emotions. He had caught everything that happened before into his eyes. He couldn&rsquo;t even be certain whether the old ape was still safe and whether his father was still being humiliated.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t blame his father, nor did he blame the old ape. He could see from the scene before what sort of days his father and the old ape were having.<br>Chu Feng could also guess that his father had done quite a bit for him. The grave was his, but it was a cover. It was likely a lie that his father made in order to make everyone within his family believe that &ldquo;Chu Feng&rdquo; had died. The goal was to bring Chu Feng away from this land.<br>That land was detrimental. Otherwise, the old ape&rsquo;s and his father&rsquo;s cultivation wouldn&rsquo;t have fallen. His father wasn&rsquo;t just driven out from his family, he, and the ape, were bearing painful torture.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know what had happened within his family; however, he was certain his parents hadn&rsquo;t been well. At least, his father hadn&rsquo;t been very well.<br>From the old ape&rsquo;s words before, Chu Feng knew there was a reason that his father acted that way, and that reason had an unshakeable relationship with him. One could even say that he, Chu Feng, harmed his father and put him in this state.<br>So, Chu Feng felt responsible. He felt very responsible, so much he nearly wished he were dead.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t hold burdens in your hearts. No matter what had happened, you weren&rsquo;t able to do anything to it. What happened has already become reality. No matter who it is, they are powerless to change the past.<br>&ldquo;However, you can change the future. Didn&rsquo;t that old ape say it too? The one who deprived your father of his honour was you, but the person who can regain your father&rsquo;s honour is also you. You can see how much expectation they&rsquo;ve entrusted you with,&rdquo; Eggy consoled when she felt Chu Feng&rsquo;s downcast mood.<br>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t disappoint their expectations. I will not only take back the honour my father lost, I will make those who stepped over my father&rsquo;s honour pay the price. Even if they&rsquo;re my family, I will not spare them.&rdquo;<br>A hint of fierceness flashed into Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes. This expression was very similar to the one his father showed before; however, it was a bit different. This sort of fierceness was a much more thorough one.<br>Because this was Chu Feng&rsquo;s resolution.<br></p></div>
