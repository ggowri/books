        <h1>Chapter 4911</h1>
        <div>: Chu Feng Arrives<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Everyone, you know well what kind of person Chu Feng is. We can&rsquo;t permit the existence of such a vermin in our Holy Light Galaxy. Those who associate themselves with him should be punished too.<br>&ldquo;The Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster has colluded with Chu Feng to betray our Holy Light Galaxy. That should have been enough to sentence him to death, but in view of his contributions to the Holy Light Galaxy, I wanted to give him a chance to turn over a new leaf.<br>&ldquo;Yet, this man knows not of repentance. How utterly foolish and abominable!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xuanye raised his hand and pulled the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster into his hands. He held the latter up by his hair, as if he was a mere beast.<br>&ldquo;Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster, I&rsquo;ll give you one last chance. As long as you&rsquo;re willing to turn over a new leaf, I&rsquo;ll at least leave you with an intact carcass!&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye bellowed.<br>The crowd had complicated looks on their faces.<br>Didn&rsquo;t this mean that the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster was going to die today regardless of what he did?<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already said that I don&rsquo;t know where they went. I won&rsquo;t be able to tell you anything even if you were to kill me.&rdquo;<br>The Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster was in a feeble state. His voice was weak, and fresh blood trickled down his mouth as he spoke.<br>Putting aside those from the Monstrous Herd Temple, even common bystanders couldn&rsquo;t bear to watch the gruesome sight.<br>They knew that the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. He only met with trouble because he had once helped Chu Feng.<br>This was simply how cruel the world of cultivation was.<br>It didn&rsquo;t matter whether the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster had done wrong or not. As long as Shengguang Xuanye proclaimed him guilty, there was no one here who could say otherwise.<br>Everyone knew that Shengguang Xuanye was planning to send out a stern warning here so as to ensure that the other powers would remain in line, and the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster was just unlucky to be caught in it.<br>&ldquo;How obstinate. Are you still dreaming that Chu Feng would come and save you? He has already fallen in the hands of the Holy Valley. There&rsquo;s no saving him anymore. Even if he&rsquo;s still breathing now, he won&rsquo;t continue to live for long,&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye said.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster sneered.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder why they often say that good people die young and vermins live for a thousand years. Even if you kill me, all you&rsquo;ll gain is feigned respect. No one will truly respect you from the bottom of their heart. That&rsquo;s because everyone knows what kind of person you truly are.<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Xuanye, you sure are a petty and despicable one for the overlord of a galaxy. You aren&rsquo;t worthy of being an overlord. You aren&rsquo;t worthy of leading any of us!&rdquo;<br>He wouldn&rsquo;t let Shengguang Xuanye have his way even to his dying breath. He dared not to speak his mind previously because he didn&rsquo;t want to lose his life yet, but since he was already doomed for death, there was no reason for him to hold his tongue anymore.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still protecting that criminal. Since that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll send you down to hell so that you can reunite with him there!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xuanye had already known from the start that the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster wouldn&rsquo;t say anything at all, but he chose to interrogate the latter anyway so as to find justification to kill him.<br>Without any hesitation, he raised his leg and stepped down on the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster. He raised his arm and formed a massive executioner&rsquo;s blade out of martial power.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster!&rdquo;<br>Cries could be heard from the Monstrous Herd Temple.<br>There were some who wanted to charge forward to save the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster, but they were stopped by the elders of the Monstrous Herd Temple.<br>What they needed to do now was to accept their fate and stop provoking the Holy Light Clan any further. Otherwise, their entire Monstrous Herd Temple might just end up getting obliterated here.<br>Shengguang Xuanye raised his blade up high, but he didn&rsquo;t bring it down right away. Instead, he scanned the crowd around him and relished in the unnerved looks on their faces.<br>His lips crept up in satisfaction.<br>This was the reaction he was looking for.<br>He had utterly embarrassed himself earlier from being suppressed by a mere junior. He wanted to make it clear to everyone that even if he was no longer the overlord of the Holy Light Galaxy, he was still a powerhouse who was only second to the Holy Valley.<br>He still had the power to take away the lives of anyone who dared to cross his path.<br>A vicious glint flashed across his eyes as he brought his blade down on the neck of the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Hold it right there!&rdquo;<br>A furious roar suddenly sounded.<br>Boom!<br>It raised a series of shockwaves across the sky. It was a mere roar, but it was enough to showcase that person&rsquo;s terrifying prowess.<br>It felt like the sky would shatter if the roar had been any louder.<br>Shengguang Xuanye immediately froze in place, but he didn&rsquo;t stop voluntarily. Rather, there was a force that was holding him in place, preventing him from bringing his blade down any further.<br>Upon hearing the voice, everyone quickly kneeled on the ground and began kowtowing. Even the members of the Holy Light Clan did the same too.<br>Deafening voices echoed in the surroundings.<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to the lords.&rdquo;<br>The members of the Holy Valley had arrived at the scene.<br>Even if the crowd couldn&rsquo;t recognize the others from the Holy Valley, there was no way they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to recognize Shengguang Baimei. They had just met him not too long ago.<br>This time around, the Holy Valley brought a huge group with them.<br>There were no monstrous beasts, no mounts, no moving palaces, and no chariots. They arrived all by themselves. Yet, the mere aura they gave off felt as if they were gods descending from heaven. The crowd shuddered in fear, not daring to raise their heads at all.<br>This was how intimidating the Holy Valley was.<br>The arrival of the Holy Valley filled the crowd with apprehension. It proved that the Holy Valley was planning on taking charge of the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>However, the situation seemed a little off as well.<br>Amongst the members of the Holy Valley stood Chu Feng, Daoist Niantian, and even the members of the Dragon Clan. They could still understand why Chu Feng was amongst them since Shengguang Baimei was the one who took him away earlier, but why would Daoist Niantian and the members of the Dragon Clan be amongst them too?<br>Didn&rsquo;t Daoist Niantian flee with the members of the Dragon Clan earlier? Could this mean that they had been captured by the members of the Holy Valley?<br>But that didn&rsquo;t make sense either. All of them were unharmed, and none of them were being treated as prisoners. Something was clearly off here.<br>While the crowd was still speculating about the truth of the situation, Chu Feng had already charged forth to save the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Scram!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng raised his leg and sent it right into Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s face, crushing the latter&rsquo;s face and sending him flying a distance away.<br>The crowd was astonished to see that, and they were more shocked when the Holy Valley didn&rsquo;t react to Chu Feng&rsquo;s action at all. Something felt incredibly off here.<br>After kicking Shengguang Xuanye away, Chu Feng crouched down and began treating the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br></p></div>
