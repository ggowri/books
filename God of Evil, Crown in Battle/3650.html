        <h1>Chapter 3649</h1>
        <div> - Challenging Everyone<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person who had blocked Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s attack was known to everyone present - Wuming Xiongmo..<br>Wuming Xiongmo&rsquo;s body was not only emitting Divine Power, but he was also emitting the power of a treasure. Most importantly, purple imprints were also present in his eyes and on his forehead. His body was also covered in strangely beautiful purple vein lines.<br>&ldquo;Wuming Xiongmo actually also managed to unlock the Wuming Clan&rsquo;s bloodline power? Those two guys, they&rsquo;re truly well-concealed,&rdquo; The crowd came to a sudden realization upon seeing Wuming Xiongmo&rsquo;s current appearance. His true strength was no weaker than Wuming Yuanzhi's<br>Those two men were truly worthy of being the top geniuses of the Starfield Master Realm. At least, both of them possessed talent worthy of being the next Wuming Clan Chief.<br>After using his Divine Power, treasure and bloodline power, Wuming Xiongmo&rsquo;s cultivation naturally increased from rank two Exalted to rank five Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Nangong Yifan let out a cold snort. Then, his arm began to tremble, and his overwhelming martial power swept forth.<br>That said, Wuming Xiongmo was also prepared. He flipped his hand and pushed.<br>Although the energy ripples from their confrontation pushed him several tens of steps away, Nangong Yifan was also pushed back.<br>While it was only ten steps, he was still pushed back from the confrontation.<br>&ldquo;Wuming Xiongmo&rsquo;s battle power is actually capable of contending against Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s battle power.&rdquo;<br>While Wuming Xiongmo stopping Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s punch could be a coincidence, what happened in the confrontation earlier was definitely not a coincidence.<br>The confrontation revealed that Wuming Xiongmo was very powerful. After all, he was able to force Nangong Yifan back.<br>That said, Wuming Xiongmo was holding a top quality Incomplete Exalted Armament in his hand.<br>That Incomplete Exalted Armament most definitely provided an enormous amount of assistance to his battle power.<br>However, Wuming Yuanzhi was holding an Incomplete Exalted Armament when he fought against Nangong Yifan earlier. Yet, even though Nangong Yifan wasn&rsquo;t using an Incomplete Exalted Armament, Wuming Yuanzhi was still unable to contend against him, and was ruthlessly suppressed by him the entire time.<br>In fact, it could be said that Wuming Yuanzhi had not managed to even fight back against Nangong Yifan throughout their entire match.<br>Thus, it could be seen that even though Wuming Xiongmo&rsquo;s strength was still inferior to Nangong Yifan's, his strength most definitely surpassed Wuming Yuanzhi's.<br>&ldquo;What capability is there in fighting two on one?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the younger generations from the All-heaven Starfield all grew restless. Not only were they shouting angrily, but Beiyang Luo and other powerful individuals among them also stood forth.<br>They seemed like were planning to start a battle against the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>&ldquo;Step down!&rdquo;<br>To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, Nangong Yifan shouted at his companions with a tone filled with impatience.<br>&ldquo;I, Nangong Yifan, can take care of this trash myself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You, you, and you, the three of you can come at me too.&rdquo;<br>Not only did Nangong Yifan say those words, but he even pointed at Kong Ci, Long Ning and Xian Yun.<br>His behavior could be said to be very disrespectful.<br>After all, he had declared them &lsquo;trash&rsquo; earlier, and then pointed at Kong Ci, Long Ning and Xian Yun.<br>Wouldn&rsquo;t this mean that, in Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s eyes, Kong Ci, Long Ning and Xian Yun were also trash?<br>Faced with such behavior from Nangong Yifan, Kong Ci and Long Ning both revealed furious scowls. They were proud geniuses standing above all others. Never before had they received such humiliation.<br>That said, although their faces turned pale with anger, they did not really step forward. After all, they felt that since they were all rank two Exalted, it would not be suitable to bully Nangong Yifan with numbers.<br>If they were to truly take on Nangong Yifan five on one, it would affect their reputations once the matter spread.<br>Even if they managed to win against him, they would be said to have had an unfair advantage in the battle.<br>If they were to lose, they would be completely humiliated.<br>&ldquo;Since young master Nangong has made such a request, then I, Xian Yun, will accept it.&rdquo;<br>To the crowd&rsquo;s surprise, when both Kong Ci and Long Ning were hesitating out of worry for their reputation, the cultured, refined and seemingly much more cool-headed Xian Yun actually stood forth.<br>At that moment, Xian Yun&rsquo;s clothes were fluttering even though there was no air. She was emitting an immortal and imposing air from all over her body.<br>Combined with the refined air that she already possessed, she truly appeared like a celestial fairy.<br>Xian Yun, as the strongest genius of Monstrous Holy City, possessed abilities no weaker than Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo.<br>Not only did she also increase her cultivation from rank two Exalted to rank five Exalted, but she was also holding a sword in her hand.<br>The sword was very thin and long. At a glance, it did not appear special at all. However, if one was to take a closer look at the sword, they would notice that it was incomparably sharp.<br>That was also a top quality Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>&ldquo;Xian Yun, she&rsquo;s serious.&rdquo;<br>Many people felt shocked by Xian Yun&rsquo;s behavior.<br>&ldquo;Paaa~~~&rdquo;<br>To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, a hand grabbed onto Xian Yun.<br>&ldquo;Xian Yun, calm yourself. Are you really planning to bully him with numbers?&rdquo; asked Kong Ci.<br>&ldquo;Kong Ci, I am very calm,&rdquo; said Xian Yun.<br>&ldquo;You are not calm in the slightest. Have you not considered the consequences of your decision?&rdquo; Kong Ci refuted.<br>&ldquo;They are already pushing us around, humiliating us. Regardless of what sort of consequences there might be, I cannot think of a reason to refuse this battle. We are martial cultivators. Why do we work so hard to train?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For illusory honor and glory? No. The way I see it, we work so hard to train because we do not wish to be humiliated by others. It&rsquo;s so that we can have the integrity to go against fate, go against the heavens.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we are to lose this integrity, then regardless of how much honor we might obtain, it will all be in vain,&rdquo; Xian Yun said.<br>&ldquo;Xian Yun, you&hellip;&rdquo; Kong Ci was stunned to hear those words. It was not only her. Long Ning and many others of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were also stunned.<br>Even Chu Feng looked at Xian Yun with a whole new level of respect.<br>He felt what Xian Yun said to be very correct.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother wasting time. If you&rsquo;re going to fight, then come at me together. Didn&rsquo;t you all wish to challenge me? Today, I will give you this opportunity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will also have you all realize what the word &lsquo;disparity&rsquo; means,&rdquo; mocked Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;This guy, he&rsquo;s simply bullying intolerably!&rdquo;<br>Kong Ci was finally unable to contain herself. She felt what Xian Yun said to be very reasonable. Her body shifted, and she flew behind Nangong Yifan.<br>Following her, Long Ning also flew over and landed behind Nangong Yifan.<br>Kong Ci and Long Ning both unleashed their strongest abilities and increased their cultivations by three entire levels to rank five Exalted.<br>Furthermore, the two of them sealed off Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s escape.<br>They were truly planning to teach him a lesson.<br>At that moment, the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were very nervous. Even the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were feeling nervous.<br>After all, Wuming Yuanzhi, Wuming Xiongmo, Kong Ci, Long Ning and Xian Yun represented the strongest powers of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. They were also the strongest younger generations present in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Their strength was recognized by most people.<br>Thus, even the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were feeling anxious. They were afraid that Nangong Yifan would not be able to withstand being besieged by the five of them.<br>The Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were equally anxious.<br>However, they were naturally not worried about Nangong Yifan. Instead, they were worried for their five geniuses.<br>Kong Ci and the others not only represented themselves. They also represented all of them, all the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>If the five of them were no match for Nangong Yifan even after joining hands to take him on, they would not be the only ones that would be humiliated. Instead, the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield would be humiliated.<br>Once the matter spread, the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield would become a laughing stock.<br>That was also the reason why Kong Ci and Long Ning were hesitant to fight Nangong Yifan earlier.<br></p></div>
