        <h1>Chapter 4721</h1>
        <div>: Song Xi Breaking Out in Tears<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fang Yunshi was currently lying on the ground beneath Chu Feng&rsquo;s feet. His cheeks were swollen, his nose was broken, and his teeth were scattered all over the ground.<br>His state was as tragic as his wails were!<br>From the looks of it, he hadn&rsquo;t just been knocked to the floor. He had obviously suffered several good punches to the face too.<br>Just what in the world happened in such a short period of time? Why would the rank four Utmost Exalted level Fang Yunshi be so helpless before Chu Feng?<br>Wasn&rsquo;t Chu Feng supposed to be only at rank one Utmost Exalted level?<br>Boom!<br>While everyone was struggling to comprehend what was going on, an oppressive might suddenly crushed down on the surroundings, jolting the disciple from the South Vermilion Hall off Song Xi&rsquo;s back. It was such a powerful strike that the latter knocked onto the cliff face and fainted.<br>As for the others, they shuddered fearfully as cold sweat trickled down their backs.<br>They could sense that Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura wasn&rsquo;t at rank one Utmost Exalted level but rank six!<br>&ldquo;Rank six Utmost Exalted level! Chu Feng, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Putting aside the others, even Song Xi was stunned by the oppressive might Chu Feng was emanating. However, Chu Feng was in no mood to bother about Song Xi. Instead, he turned his gaze toward Hei Yao.<br>&ldquo;Hei Yao, are you still a disciple of the North Tortoise Hall? It&rsquo;s one thing for you not to help your own peer, but you even sided with others to frame your own people?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng exerted his oppressive might and crushed Hei Yao down onto the floor. It was a powerful strike that sent spurts of blood gushing out from Hei Yao&rsquo;s mouth.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng, please let me off! I had no choice! Fang Yunshi has Senior Xia Ran behind his back, and we can&rsquo;t possibly hope to defeat them. I&rsquo;m just trying to protect myself here!&rdquo; Hei Yao pleaded desperately with tears streaming down his cheeks.<br>&ldquo;Song Xi, how do you want to deal with him?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to Song Xi and asked.<br>Song Xi shot a glance at Hei Yao before saying, &ldquo;Let him go.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng released the oppressive might crushing down on Hei Yao.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Junior Chu Feng! Thank you, Junior Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>Hei Yao quickly rushed to his feet and thanked Chu Feng. This was simply how people without pride were. Previously when Chu Feng accorded him respect, he chose to make things difficult for him at every turn. Yet, now that he was finally getting beaten up, he ended up thanking Chu Feng instead.<br>This was simply how most people were like, fearing the strong and oppressing the weak. Chu Feng had seen far too many people like Hei Yao.<br>He turned his gaze away from Hei Yao to eye at the disciples of the South Vermilion Hall coldly as he questioned, &ldquo;Who else made a move on the disciples of our North Tortoise Hall earlier?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t, we didn&rsquo;t! None of us made a move earlier!&rdquo;<br>The disciples of the South Vermilion Hall shook their heads vehemently, and some of their voices were quivering out of fear.<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, am not a person to implicate others. If none of you made a move, I won&rsquo;t make things difficult for you. However, I want you to remember that I won&rsquo;t allow you to bully anyone in the North Tortoise Hall from this day onward. If I were to learn that any one of them has been unfairly treated&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng raised his leg and stomped down hard on Fang Yunshi&rsquo;s back twice. Every strike, Fang Yunshi would cry out wretchedly as a &lsquo;kacha&rsquo; sound echoed loudly, signaling the fracturing of Fang Yunshi&rsquo;s arm and leg.<br>Chu Feng pointed at Fang Yunshi as he continued, &ldquo;&hellip; this is how you&rsquo;ll end up.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We dare not to!&rdquo;<br>The disciples of the South Vermilion Hall hurriedly shook their heads. Even those from the East Dragon Hall and West Tiger Hall felt chills down their spines just by looking at this sight, and they hurriedly backed away out of fear.<br>Some of the timider ones even fled the area, fearing that they would be implicated.<br>Even though they were from the East Dragon Hall and West Dragon Hall, their cultivation levels weren&rsquo;t too high. Most of them weren&rsquo;t on par with Song Xi and Fang Yunshi here. Given their lacking strength, it was only normal for them to fear Chu Feng.<br>As for Chu Feng, after saying his piece, he raised his head to look at the peak above and said, &ldquo;Looks like I can&rsquo;t head back anymore.&rdquo;<br>He could feel the pressure crushing down from the area where he had come down from earlier. It would appear that one could only head down from the peak, not up. In other words, wherever the teleportation formation had teleported one to was the highest altitude one could reach here.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Chu Feng&hellip;&rdquo; Song Xi suddenly said with a tearful voice.<br>Chu Feng turned his head over, only to see Song Xi kneeling on the floor in front of him. The spectating crowd was confused to see this scene.<br>The fact that Chu Feng had stepped forward for Song Xi&rsquo;s sake showed that they were on good terms with one another, but why would Song Xi still kneel to him?<br>However, Chu Feng knew the reason behind his action.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for this. Get up. If I really held a grudge against you, I wouldn&rsquo;t have helped you in the first place,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he pulled Song Xi up with his strength.<br>However, Song Xi quickly fell back down to his kneeling position right after. He cried even more in agitation as his lower jaws trembled uncontrollably. Tears and snot were dripping from his face.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, trust me. I know how well you have treated me. I&rsquo;ve always remembered your gratitude, never daring to forget it. But&hellip; I just didn&rsquo;t want to admit it. I didn&rsquo;t want to admit that you&rsquo;re stronger than me. I thought that I&rsquo;ve already surpassed you, but I was wrong. I really am.<br>&ldquo;In truth, I&rsquo;ve always viewed you as my role model. I wanted to become someone like you, being able to care for those weaker than me when I have the ability to. I want to become someone who trustworthy and reliable to my friends, a hero to those in need. But it&rsquo;s simply too difficult. When a person rises to a certain position, all the hypocriticism starts to show through. It&rsquo;s too difficult to remember my origins under the compliments and praises showered upon me. It becomes so hard to discern what&rsquo;s real and what&rsquo;s false.<br>&ldquo;However, even if it could all be false, I still want to hold on to it. I don&rsquo;t want to lose the feeling of being hailed and respected by everyone else. I was afraid that your arrival would bring about my downfall in the North Tortoise Hall. I was afraid that I would turn back into the man looked down on by everyone else. I was afraid that I would lose everything!<br>&ldquo;So, greed got the better of me. I did something I should have never done. I did something that&rsquo;s unforgivable. You are my benefactor, and I should have done everything I could to return your favor. Yet, I turned my back against you instead.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Chu Feng. I shrugged off your goodwill and betrayed you. I&rsquo;m really a scoundrel, an ingrate!&rdquo;<br>Song Xi began kowtowing to Chu Feng, striking his head against the ground so hard that his forehead started to bleed.<br></p></div>
