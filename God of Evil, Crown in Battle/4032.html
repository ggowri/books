        <div> - The Stubborn Chu Feng<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Asura?&rdquo;<br>The expressions of many people changed upon seeing Chu Feng.<br>The majority of the crowd recognized him.<br>The name Asura had become renowned since the battle against the All-heaven Sect.<br>However, those three men evidently did not recognize Chu Feng.<br>However, they still revealed looks of shock the moment they saw him.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng was actually flying in the sky, and slowly moving.<br>One must know that the oppressive might unleashed by that old man was extremely powerful.<br>Not even Zhao Hong was able to move under the influence of that oppressive might. That alone illustrated how powerful the old man was.<br>Yet, Chu Feng was actually able to move.<br>Although he was having great difficulty moving, it remained that he was moving.<br>That was the reason why those three men were so astonished.<br>&ldquo;Unbelievable. To become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist at such a young age.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who would&rsquo;ve thought that such a talented person of the younger generation would emerge from such a desolate place?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve truly broadened this old man&rsquo;s horizons.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance had even caused the old man in the war chariot to exclaim in admiration.<br>As the person who had unleashed the oppressive might, he knew very well that it was simply impossible to contend against his oppressive might using only martial power. After all, he was targeting martial cultivators with his oppressive might.<br>By the same reasoning, his oppressive might was not aimed at world spiritists.<br>As such, if one&rsquo;s world spirit techniques were sufficiently powerful, they would really be able to contend against his oppressive might.<br>That said, one had to be at least a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist to be able to barely contend against his oppressive might.<br>As such, even though Chu Feng had not unleashed his spirit power, the old man was able to determine, through his experience, that Chu Feng was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>&ldquo;Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>Hearing the old man&rsquo;s words, the three men finally realized why Chu Feng was able to move under the influence of the oppressive might.<br>It turned out that the young man was actually a powerful world spiritist.<br>As such, the gazes with which the three men looked at Chu Feng changed. They began to size him up once again.<br>That said, the leader of the three had a very ill-intended gaze.<br>It was a gaze of jealousy.<br>Such a genius had actually appeared in a place he looked down on. This brought him enormous displeasure.<br>&ldquo;Since she doesn&rsquo;t wish to follow you, you shouldn&rsquo;t be forcing her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a stern voice.<br>Even though he was having difficulty moving, he was still able to slowly approach the three men.<br>&ldquo;It seems that you know her?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well. If you&rsquo;re capable, come over here and take her away from me.&rdquo;<br>Contempt filled the man&rsquo;s voice.<br>At the same time, killing intent was present.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave with you all.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the situation was bad, Yin Zhuanghong decided to get on the war chariot of her own accord.<br>However, right after she stepped onto the war chariot, she was forcibly pulled back by the man.<br>&ldquo;Yoh, you&rsquo;re actually trying to shield him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the relationship between the two of you is quite extraordinary,&rdquo; the man said as he looked at Yin Zhuanghong.<br>After saying those words, he turned his gaze to Chu Feng. His gaze had become even icier. &ldquo;Trash, come over here. If you&rsquo;re able to snatch her from my grasp&hellip; we will not make things difficult for you today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Asura, don&rsquo;t come over! I&rsquo;ve decided to go with them!&rdquo;<br>Yin Zhuanghong sensed that the man harbored malicious intentions and immediately shouted at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Asura? Is that your name?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What a resounding name. I only wonder if your courage is equally as resounding as your name,&rdquo; the man said to Chu Feng with a mocking voice.<br>&ldquo;Asura, go back. I&rsquo;ve made this decision myself. They didn&rsquo;t force me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t belong here to begin with. I also want to know my origins.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Earlier, I was merely angry. That&rsquo;s why I refused them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve woken up from my state of anger already. I&rsquo;m going to follow them to figure out my origins.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I believe they won&rsquo;t make things difficult for me. If a chance presents itself in the future, I will come back here.&rdquo;<br>Yin Zhuanghong continued to try dissuade Chu Feng. For the sake of making him give up, she even began to lie.<br>&ldquo;Asura, you&rsquo;re no match for them. Do not try to show off, return quickly.&rdquo;<br>Many voice transmissions also entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>Those voice transmissions were from Han Xiu and the others.<br>However, no matter how they attempted to dissuade Chu Feng, he continued to move towards that Lian Xi .<br>Finally, Chu Feng arrived before him and Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Chu Feng stared straight at Lian Xi.<br>He was able to sense how ice-cold the man&rsquo;s gaze was.<br>He was threatening him, warning him that he&rsquo;d best behave himself.<br>If Chu Feng really dared to do anything, he would most definitely suffer a miserable end.<br>Yet, even though he was fully aware of his threat, Chu Feng smiled faintly, and then extended his arm to grab Yin Zhaunghong.<br>&ldquo;Reckless fool.&rdquo;<br>Lian Xi let out a mocking laugh at Chu Feng&rsquo;s action.<br>Then, he raised his hand and sent forth a palm strike at Chu Feng&rsquo;s dantian.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng immediately spurted blood after being struck by the palm strike. Like an arrow, he shot back explosively. In the blink of an eye, he had left the sky and smashed into the ground.<br>The enormous impact of the crash shattered the rocks and left a massive crater in the ground.<br>The cracking sounds from the impact were not only the sounds of rocks being shattered. They were also sounds of Chu Feng&rsquo;s bones being shattered.<br>With only a single palm strike, the man had managed to seriously injure Chu Feng.<br>However, even with that, the man did not plan to spare him.<br>He actually released his grip on Yin Zhuanghong, descended from the sky and began walking towards Chu Feng.<br>With his cultivation, the palm strike earlier had been more than enough to take Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.<br>However, he did not do that.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that he was being lenient. Rather, he wanted Chu Feng to die a miserable death.<br>He wanted to slowly torture Chu Feng to death.<br>However, at that moment, the old man&rsquo;s voice sounded, &ldquo;Lian Xi, that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;<br>Hearing the voice, Lian Xi immediately stopped.<br>Although he was still furious, he had no choice but to stop under the orders of the old man.<br>That said, he still felt very unreconciled, and thus decided to glare at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Ant.&rdquo;<br>After leaving behind that word, he finally turned around and brought Yin Zhaunghong into the war chariot.<br>After they entered the war chariot, the war chariot turned around and began flying into the direction they'd come from.<br>Very soon, it had disappeared into the distant horizon.<br>As the war chariot disappeared, the oppressive might that had enveloped the region also disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Asura, are you alright?&rdquo;<br>When the oppressive might disappeared, Han Xiu, Zhao Hong and the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders all rushed over to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. It&rsquo;s merely a superficial wound,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Superficial wound? It doesn&rsquo;t look like that to me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That bastard&rsquo;s palm strike landed on your dantian.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let me have a look.&rdquo;<br>As Zhao Hong spoke, she began to inspect Chu Feng&rsquo;s injury.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really fine. I&rsquo;m not that weak,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>Soon, Zhao Hong heaved a sigh of relief.<br>She discovered that Chu Feng was indeed not trying to show off. Although the man&rsquo;s palm strike had landed on Chu Feng&rsquo;s dantian, his dantian was indeed not injured.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had protected his dantian with a spirit formation ahead of time.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with you? Why did you decide to deliberately go up there to take a beating?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for that old man in the war chariot stopping that bastard, he would have definitely tortured you to death,&rdquo; Zhao Hong looked at Chu Feng in a confused manner.<br>Although she knew that Chu Feng was willing to risk his life for his friends, she also knew that he was not impulsive to a state of foolishness.<br>The situation earlier was not a situation where he needed to do something for certain.<br>Although those people were tyrannical, they were rather courteous towards Yin Zhuanghong.<br>From that, it could be seen that even if she were to leave with them, she would not be in danger.<br>It was clearly not a sensible act for Chu Feng to forcibly stand up to those people in such a situation.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. It&rsquo;s merely that after I saw how that girl didn&rsquo;t want to leave, I wanted to try to stop them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, I am too weak,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a wry smile.<br>Seeing Chu Feng like that, Zhao Hong and others revealed a look of regret.<br>What they didn&rsquo;t know was that even though Chu Feng was smiling wryly, he was actually secretly delighted.<br>The reason for that was because his plan had succeeded.<br></p></div>
