        <h1>Chapter 3559</h1>
        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Gaze<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Big brother, why haven&rsquo;t you interrogated them?&rdquo; asked Zhang Boyi.<br>Sure enough, the person sitting in the master seat was Zhang Yanfeng.<br>&ldquo;The ones that have been captured are all trash. It&rsquo;s useless to interrogate them,&rdquo; Zhang Yanfeng did not even open his eyes. He completely revealed how much contempt he had for those people.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Zhang Boyi expressed his helplessness with a sigh.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a cry of surprise was heard. That single cry of surprise was immediately echoed by many others. In an instant, surprise-filled cries filled the entire palace hall.<br>The palace hall that was originally very quiet to an eerie degree instantly burst into an uproar.<br>Looking up, the area above the palace hall was no longer the path that Chu Feng came from. The passageway he had traveled through had disappeared.<br>Replacing the passageway was an enormous cage hanging from the top of the palace hall.<br>The cage was packed full with people.<br>There were people from other powers there. That said, the great majority of them were from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Among them were people from the Ghost Sect Hall and the Starfall Holy Land.<br>Of course&hellip; there were also people from the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>All of them were tied up. They had truly become prisoners.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Hearing the cries of alarm, Zhang Yanfeng, who was originally resting with his eyes closed, finally opened his eyes.<br>After surveying his surroundings, his gaze quickly locked onto Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Lil sis, who is he? Could he be that Chu Feng?&rdquo; Zhang Yanfeng asked.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, that is indeed Chu Feng. He&rsquo;s that guy who managed to draw against Linghu Hongfei.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I&rsquo;ve managed to defeat him,&rdquo; Zhang Shirui grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s collar and started walking toward Zhang Yanfeng. She was feeling extremely proud. Even her walking was particularly exaggerated.<br>&ldquo;Defeated by you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible. How could he be defeated by you? Could it be that the rumors are false?&rdquo; Zhang Yanfeng stood up and began to carefully size up Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;The rumors are true. However, he is no match for me,&rdquo; said Zhang Shirui.<br>However, Zhang Yanfeng only cast a side eye at Zhang Shirui. He then said, &ldquo;You used the power of the spirit formation to seal off his spirit power, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Haha, you figured that out? As expected of my big brother,&rdquo; Zhang Shirui revealed a smile. Although that smile was very sweet, it was also very shameless.<br>&ldquo;Lil sis, that&rsquo;s having an unfair advantage,&rdquo; as Zhang Yanfeng spoke, his palm moved toward the pendant on his chest.<br>Chu Feng noticed that when Zhang Yanfeng&rsquo;s palm touched his pendant, a special sort of aura appeared in the palace hall. The aura lasted but an instant. However, Chu Feng still noticed it.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng noticed that Zhang Yanfeng&rsquo;s pendant was different from that of Zhang Shirui and Zhang Boyi.<br>Originally, the pendants that the three of them possessed were all flickering with a glimmer.<br>However, the glimmer on Zhang Boyi and Zhang Shirui&rsquo;s pendants had now disappeared while Zhang Yanfeng&rsquo;s pendant was shining even brighter.<br>It was as if the power of Zhang Boyi and Zhang Shirui&rsquo;s pendants had been extinguished by Zhang Yanfeng.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, what are you doing? That guy is a Saint-cloak World Spiritist; he&rsquo;s very dangerous.&rdquo;<br>Zhang Shirui hurriedly released Chu Feng and ran behind Zhang Yanfeng.<br>It was not only her. Zhang Boyi and the other Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen present had also all arrived behind Zhang Yanfeng.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? You don&rsquo;t trust your big brother&rsquo;s ability?&rdquo; Zhang Yanfeng took a glance at Zhang Shirui.<br>Zhang Shirui pouted her mouth. She seemed to want to say something but, in the end, said nothing.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you want to challenge me?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I want to experience the abilities of Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I am not going to seal your spirit power. I wish that we'll be able to have a fair battle.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if you release that world spirit of yours, things will become boring. Even though it's also your ability to possess that world spirit, in the end, that world spirit&rsquo;s abilities are not yours.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I wish to battle you, and not your world spirit. Do you understand my intention?&rdquo; Zhang Yanfeng asked.<br>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;For the sake of fairness, I will not use too many abilities to increase my cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that you possess the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, and your world spirit techniques are on par with a rank two Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I'll only increase my cultivation to rank two Exalted. Furthermore, I will not use any weapons. That would be fair then,&rdquo; said Zhang Yanfeng.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite a decent character. You&rsquo;re much better than your younger sister,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to Zhang Shirui.<br>&ldquo;Tsk~~~&rdquo; Zhang Shirui was not angered. Instead, she merely rolled her eyes at Chu Feng disappoingly.<br>&ldquo;If I lose, will I die here?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more or less the case,&rdquo; said Zhang Yanfeng.<br>&ldquo;In that case, what if I win?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Then you can go,&rdquo; said Zhang Yanfeng.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that wouldn&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Then what do you want?&rdquo; asked Zhang Yanfeng.<br>Chu Feng raised his hand and pointed to the top of the palace hall, pointing to where the captives were imprisoned.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take them with me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to understand your situation. You don't possess the qualifications to haggle here,&rdquo; Zhang Shirui looked to Chu Feng mockingly.<br>Chu Feng merely smiled at Zhang Shirui&rsquo;s mockery. He said, &ldquo;My apologies, little girl, I&rsquo;m afraid that I do possess the qualifications that you spoke of.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; At that moment, Zhang Shirui wanted to curse Chu Feng out. However, before her words could reach her mouth, she swallowed them down.<br>She didn&rsquo;t understand why but Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze had changed to become completely different from before. It was like he was someone completely different.<br>She felt a very strange feeling upon seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze.<br>She was feeling&hellip; fear?<br></p></div>
