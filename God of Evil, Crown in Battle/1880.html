        <div> - To Live Or Die Together<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Cure your father&rsquo;s illness?&rdquo; Chu Feng did not expect for Bai Ruochen to suddenly request that he do that.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I beg of you. Our family has finally managed to reunite with one another. I do not want to have only me and my mother remain,&rdquo; When Bai Ruochen said those words, glistening teardrops covered her face, leaving her with a very pitiful appearance.<br>&ldquo;Although I do not know what sort of incurable illness your father is afflicted with, I am willing to attempt to cure it with all of my strength,&rdquo; After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he turned around and walked out of the cave, with Bai Ruochen following closely behind him.<br>At that moment, Nangong Longjian, the Compass Immortal and Bai Suyan were all outside. Judging from their appearances, Nangong Longjian should have already explained the situation to the Compass Immortal.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, what do you think about the whole inheritance process?&rdquo; The Compass Immortal asked.<br>&ldquo;This sort of matter is the most difficult. Since ancient times, which expert has not wanted to pass on their cultivation to their descendants? However, very few among them were actually able to accomplish it. As far as I know, only Emperor Gong, Gong Wuming, Emperor Huang, Huangfu Shou, and the Beast Emperor, the Black Dragon King, have managed to barely accomplish this,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? There were actually really people who accomplished this feat of passing on their power on to the later generation? It would seem that little friend Chu Feng possesses quite extensive knowledge. Come, tell us about it,&rdquo; The Compass Immortal said curiously.<br>Nangong Longjian, Bai Suyan and Bai Ruochen also looked to Chu Feng with surprised expressions. None of them knew about the things regarding Emperor Gong, Emperor Huang and the Beast Emperor.<br>&ldquo;As there are no outsiders here, I will not conceal these matters from you all. Merely, I hope that you all will keep these secret. The reason for that is because those three Overlord&rsquo;s successors are all my friends,&rdquo; Then, Chu Feng began to explain to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;This is truly an extraordinary era. It turned out that it is not only Emperor Gong and Emperor Huang&rsquo;s successors that have appeared, even the Beast Emperor&rsquo;s successor has appeared.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, they are not only successors in name. Rather, they actually obtained the power of the three Overlords. It is no wonder that Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s cultivation was able to advance by leaps and bounds this quickly,&rdquo; After the Compass Immortal learned about the situation, he gasped with great admiration.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected the Beast Emperor, the Black Dragon King, to be from the King Monstrous Dragon Race. Furthermore, the King Monstrous Dragon Race&rsquo;s princess has actually obtained the Beast Emperor&rsquo;s inheritance. It would appear that the King Monstrous Dragon Race is bound to emerge in power,&rdquo; Nangong Longjian said.<br>&ldquo;Most remarkably, the three successors are all related to Chu Feng. I think&hellip; little friend Chu Feng must have provided meritorious services for the three of them to obtain their inheritance smoothly, right?&rdquo; Bai Suyan looked to Chu Feng with a beaming smile.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng laughed mischievously. Although he did not wish to admit to it, it was indeed related to him that his three friends were able to successfully obtain their inheritances.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, I will have to trouble you and Compass Immortal to help me. As long as you&rsquo;re capable of helping me pass my cultivation on to Ruochen, I will agree to anything,&rdquo; Nangong Longjian clasped his fist respectfully to Chu Feng. His gaze was filled with appeal.<br>For such a grand character to make a request of Chu Feng, someone of the younger generation, in such a manner, Chu Feng was able to tell that he really wanted to pass his cultivation on to Bai Ruochen.<br>&ldquo;Senior Longjian, it is not that this Chu Feng does not wish to help you. Merely, this Chu Feng has only just become a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, and is not very familiar with this power yet. It is truly too difficult for me to do such a thing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, even for Emperor Huang, Emperor Gong and the Beast Emperor, while they were able to successfully pass their power on to the later generations, they were unable to allow their later generations to reach the heights that they had back then instantly. Their successors still needed to slowly train.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In other words, while they indeed managed to pass on their power, they did not manage to do so with absolute success. They merely managed to pass on a portion of their strength to the later generations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Moreover, they were all an era&rsquo;s overlords. Their world spirit techniques were all incomparable during the era in which they lived. When even they were only able to accomplish that much, if you want me to help, truth be told, it will really be extremely difficult to accomplish.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng shook his head. He was speaking the truth. Passing on one&rsquo;s power was truly too difficult. Even though he was proficient in many of the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram&rsquo;s lost spirit formation techniques, he still only possessed a thirty percent certainty in successfully passing on Nangong Longjian&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>&ldquo;What little friend Chu Feng said is reasonable. Nangong Longjian, it is not that this old man does not wish to help you, it is just that something like passing on one&rsquo;s power is truly too difficult. Not to mention finding little friend Chu Feng and I to help you with it, even if you were to gather all of the Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists in the Holy Land of Martialism, this might still not be possible to accomplish.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, this old man is truly powerless to help you,&rdquo; The Compass Immortal also shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, Compass Immortal, please, no matter what, please help me. As long as you do not cause harm to my daughter, I am willing to do anything,&rdquo; Saying those words, Nangong Longjian knelt on the ground with a &lsquo;putt.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, what are you doing?!!!&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed enormously upon seeing this scene.<br>&ldquo;Quickly, get back up. We cannot accept this,&rdquo; Even the Compass Immortal was incomparably shocked. He hurriedly stepped forth to lend Nangong Longjian an arm.<br>What sort of person was Nangong Longjian? He was someone that would not kneel to either the heavens or the earth. Yet, for the sake of his daughter, he was actually kneeling to them.<br>&ldquo;Father, please don&rsquo;t do this. Your daughter does not wish for your power. I merely want you to continue living,&rdquo; At that moment, Bai Ruochen was crying. Being shown such paternal love, how could she not cry?<br>However, regardless of how hard Bai Ruochen, Bai Suyan, Chu Feng and the Compass Immortal tried to help Nangong Longjian back up, they were unable to stop him from kneeling.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please get up. I have a method that might be able to solve both issues,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, is what you said the truth?&rdquo; Nangong Longjian asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded his head repeatedly.<br>Hearing those words, Nangong Longjian hurriedly stood back up and asked, &ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, what is the method that you spoke of?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I know that senior wholeheartedly wishes to pass his power on to Ruochen because you wish to use your power to protect Ruochen and her mother.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if senior is able to be cured, senior will be able to protect them himself. As such, there will be no need for you to pass your power on to Ruochen, no?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing those words, Nangong Longjian laughed an extremely helpless laugh.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, I know my own body the best. This illness of mine is something that no one can treat. Even the Weaponry Refinement Immortal was unable to cure me of it,&rdquo; Nangong Longjian said.<br>&ldquo;If we do not attempt it, how will we know?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;What little friend Chu Feng said is correct. Although the Weaponry Refinement Immortal&rsquo;s world spirit techniques are exceptional, he specializes in weaponry refinement techniques. However, this untalented old man has studied various kinds of innate diseases and incurable illnesses before. If you do not mind, allow this old man to give it a try,&rdquo; The Compass Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Nangong Longjian frowned slightly. He seemed to have hidden troubles.<br>&ldquo;Senior, is something wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;This illness of mine is simply incapable of being detected normally because it is hidden within my dantian and mixed with my source energy. I must completely activate it with my own power in order for others to discover it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, should I activate it, I will be tormented by the illness. While the pain might not be much, I am unable to return to normal temporarily should my illness act up. I fear&hellip; that I do not have the time,&rdquo; Nangong Longjian spoke of his difficulties.<br>&ldquo;Father, if you are to die, your daughter will not live anymore either,&rdquo; Bai Ruochen kneeled before Nangong Longjian. Not only was she covered with tears, she had an extremely determined expression on her face.<br>&ldquo;Rouchen, you&hellip;&rdquo; Seeing Bai Ruochen acting in such a manner, Nangong Longjian felt extremely pained. Thus, he took a glance at Bai Suyan. He wanted her to help him advise Bai Ruochen against it.<br>&ldquo;Longjian, I am the same as Ruochen. If we cannot enjoy life together, we shall reunite with one another in death,&rdquo; Bai Suyan smiled lightly with an expression of having seen through life and death.<br></p></div>
