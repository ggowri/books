        <h1>Chapter 5083</h1>
        <div>: Chu Feng&rsquo;s Return<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was just that the figure was gone in a flash so that Wang Yuxian couldn&rsquo;t tell if she had seen wrong. Still, she started to panic.<br>She knew just how loyal Chu Feng was, and she was afraid that Chu Feng had returned to save them. It was one thing if he had brought allies back, but he would be courting death if he returned alone.<br>&ldquo;Zhuge Yuankong, you probably would have never thought that you would die in my hands?&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu said with a gleeful smile.<br>&ldquo;Sima Xiangtu, you do perfectly well as a scum, but you should know that scums have to eventually face their retribution. You can be gleeful for now, but know that a day will come where my disciple, Chu Feng, will knock on your door and claim your life,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng? I nearly forgot to tell you that your disciple is already dead,&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu said.<br>&ldquo;Rubbish! Chu Feng can&rsquo;t possibly be dead!&rdquo; Wang Yuxian refuted loudly.<br>The others revealed looks of disbelief too, but Sima Xiangtu wasn&rsquo;t deterred in the least.<br>&ldquo;Well, I must say that your disciple is indeed loyal. He actually went to the Asura Graveyard to request the help of those Asura Evil Spirits for your sake. He brought a little girl named Yaoyao there, and she turns out to be the princess of the Asura Graveyard and possesses the power to bring the Asura Evil Spirits out. Furthermore, he nearly succeeded.<br>&ldquo;He nearly succeeded, if not for the fact that I have people there too. Right before Yaoyao could free those Asura Evil Spirits, my disciple pushed her into the hellfire. Chu Feng leaped into the hellfire after her in order to save her.<br>&ldquo;He probably didn&rsquo;t know that the Asura Graveyard&rsquo;s hellfire can burn all things in the world, such that even a Half-God level cultivator would be reduced to ashes within moments. All it took was a split moment for him to completely disappear from the face of the world. How pitiful!&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu exclaimed.<br>Wang Yuxian, the Godwish Grandmother, and the Lady of Dao Sea were appalled. Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s words sounded incredibly convincing, especially since they knew about Yaoyao&rsquo;s origins.<br>Wang Yuxian broke down into tears. She wished that the person she had just seen was none other than Chu Feng. At the very least, that would have meant that he was still alive.<br>&ldquo;Lele, why are you crying? Don&rsquo;t tell me that you buy into that old thing&rsquo;s lies?&rdquo; a familiar voice suddenly echoed from afar.<br>The crowd immediately looked over, and their eyes widened in astonishment. Be it the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Wang Yuxian, Sima Xiangtu, or even Prince Brightsun, all of them found the situation inconceivable.<br>The person who had just appeared was none other than Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Impossible! I saw him fall into the hellfire with my own eyes. How could he still be alive?&rdquo; Prince Brightsun murmured in disbelief.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how dare you come back here?&rdquo; a voice filled with hostility boomed.<br>Jiang Yuantai, Jiang Kongping, Jiang Taibai, and the others from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect stepped out from a nearby palace. It turned out that they had been spectating the ritual, but Chu Feng&rsquo;s arrival prompted them to make an appearance.<br>&ldquo;Jiang Yuantai, it&rsquo;s good that you&rsquo;re here. I wish to have another duel with you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? You didn&rsquo;t lose pathetically enough the last time and want to give it another try? Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t you know that you would have already been dead if my younger brother, Jiang Kongping, hadn&rsquo;t pleaded for mercy on your behalf?&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai looked at Chu Feng mockingly.<br>While he was perplexed by how Chu Feng dared to return, he didn&rsquo;t think that the latter was a threat at all. No matter how talented Chu Feng was, he could only see the latter as a defeated foe.<br>Since he was able to beat Chu Feng once, he would surely be able to do so for a second time. Loss was the last thing that was on his mind.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not waste time spouting such nonsense. You can tell me straight if you don&rsquo;t dare,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile of ridicule.<br>Jiang Yuantai was provoked by those words. His massive ego wouldn&rsquo;t allow an enemy whom he had already defeated to make light of him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you must be either dumb or fearless. Very well, I&rsquo;ll play with you once again. However, I shall warn you that I won&rsquo;t spare you this time around no matter who begs on your behalf. You shall die under my spear!&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai spat.<br>&ldquo;Sure. Let&rsquo;s go by the old rules. We&rsquo;ll suppress our cultivation to rank four Martial Exalted level. Usage of martial skills, secret skills, and the sort are all forbidden. We&rsquo;ll fight using weapons and our raw strength. If I lose, my life will be yours to take. If I win, you have to release my master and everyone else. On top of that, you&rsquo;ll bring your Pill Dao Immortal Sect out of here and never return to the Eastern Region!&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What arrogant words. Chu Feng, you can&rsquo;t really be thinking that you&rsquo;ll be able to defeat me?&rdquo;<br>Jiang Yuantai looked at Chu Feng as if he was looking at a fool. It was as if a mere canary dared to stand up against an eagle. How hilarious it was!<br>Sima Xiangtu, the others from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, and the many cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy couldn&rsquo;t understand the situation either. They couldn&rsquo;t comprehend why Chu Feng was challenging Jiang Yuantai once again.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Wang Yuxian, the Lady of Dao Sea, and the others looked at Chu Feng with aching hearts. They kept sending voice transmissions to him, urging him to leave the place. They could already see the outcome of the duel.<br>In their view, there was no need for Chu Feng to go through with this meaningless farce if he had managed to find a powerful backing to save them. He could have just gotten the powerful backing to make a move straight away instead of relying on Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s untrustworthy bet.<br>It was already apparent to them that Chu Feng had failed to find helpers and was simply risking his life for their sake.<br></p></div>
