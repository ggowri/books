        <h1>Chapter 4475</h1>
        <div>: Powerless To Retaliate<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng&rsquo;s words left everyone flabbergasted.<br>There was a moment of silence before a huge uproar broke out amidst the crowd.<br>Zhao Batian&rsquo;s lips were quivering intensely as he glared at Chu Feng murderously.<br>Awoo!<br>But at this moment, the sky suddenly darkened as furious howls sounded.<br>The sky, which was covered in blue flame a moment ago, was suddenly overwhelmed by the emergence of four massive sacred beasts.<br>&ldquo;What are those?&rdquo;<br>Those sacred beasts were massive in size, and they looked lifelike as well. Screams of terror sounded amongst the crowd as they thought that they were in grave danger.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Divine Power! It seems to be a Divine Power!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My gosh, what a powerful Divine Power! It actually overpowers even Zhao Batian&rsquo;s Divine Power!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whose is it? Who is the one who commands such a powerful Divine Power?&rdquo;<br>The crowd quickly figured out what was going on, but it only served to further their shock.<br>In truth, even Zhao Batian&rsquo;s expression had turned a little complicated. From the slight frown on his face, it was apparent that he wasn&rsquo;t feeling too good at the moment.<br>Zhao Batian was a highly talented cultivator who commanded great fighting prowess. It was rare for him to meet anyone who was his match even within the same cultivation realm, and the one thing that he was proudest about was his Divine Power.<br>It was his Divine Power that allowed him to overcome all of his peers and rise to the top.<br>In fact, even when he was fighting with enemies who possessed Divine Powers as well, his Divine Power would always overpower the other party, and that had always left him feeling deeply gleeful on the inside.<br>He never thought that a day would come where his Divine Power would be overpowered.<br>Furthermore, judging from the sight above, it wasn&rsquo;t even a close fight between the two. His Divine Power was utterly outmatched here. This was definitely not a pleasant sight for him.<br>&ldquo;Look at that person! He&rsquo;s emanating the same aura as those four massive beasts! Could he be the owner of the Divine Power!&rdquo;<br>Someone suddenly pointed at Chu Feng and exclaimed in shock.<br>In the next moment, a massive commotion exploded amongst the onlooker.<br>At this very moment, the silhouettes of the sacred beasts were overlapping with Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, indicating clearly who the master of the Divine Power was.<br>&ldquo;No, this can&rsquo;t be possible. How could this happen?&rdquo; Zhao Batian clenched his fists tightly as he growled in disbelief.<br>Chu Feng was a person who possessed the Heavenly Bloodline. The Divine Character Lightning Mark and the Lightning Armor were proof of that. How could a person who possessed the Heavenly Bloodline grasp Divine Power too?<br>Weng!<br>But in the next moment, right before everyone&rsquo;s eyes, the four energies that were shrouding Chu Feng dived into his body, causing his cultivation to rise once more to rank eight Utmost Exalted level.<br>&ldquo;He actually managed to grasp Divine Power too? He must be a monster!&rdquo;<br>The crowd was still assessing Chu Feng in skepticism a moment ago, but at this very moment, they were staring at him with their mouths agape in horror.<br>Putting aside those from the younger generation, even those from the older generation were utterly stunned. Everyone was taken aback by the prowess that Chu Feng had shown.<br>&ldquo;Speaking of which, this exalted was also shocked when young friend Chu Feng first showed his Divine Power,&rdquo; the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster remarked with a chuckle.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen those who possess multiple Divine Powers, but the nature of the Heavenly Bloodline is at odds with that of Divine Powers. Young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s feat of being able to utilize those two powers simultaneously to raise his cultivation is deeply unbelievable. It is something that will cause a huge commotion regardless of which part of the world of cultivators one is in,&rdquo; the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;So what if you have this kind of unorthodox means? A true cultivator relies on his skills! Today, I shall give you the honor of witnessing the prowess of Zhao Batian!&rdquo; Zhao Batian bellowed furiously.<br>A massive turquoise blade appeared in his grasp, and it emanated the same blue flames as that of his Divine Power.<br>&ldquo;He actually brought out his Incomplete Exalted Armament, the Turquoiseflame Demon Saber right at the start of the battle. It seems like Zhao Batian has acknowledged that lad&rsquo;s prowess.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Well, that lad is indeed quite formidable, but Zhao Batian is no ordinary cultivator either. I&rsquo;m really curious to know that in a fight between those two, who will emerge victorious!&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing Zhao Batian bringing forth his Incomplete Exalted Armament, those who were familiar with him couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a little expectant of the fight that was going to occur.<br>Shoosh!<br>All of a sudden, a shadow flitted in Zhao Batian&rsquo;s direction.<br>It was no other than Chu Feng. He had also brought out his Incomplete Exalted Armament, and he charged right at Zhao Batian in the next moment.<br>He didn&rsquo;t use any martial skill, opting to rely on his raw might as a rank eight Utmost Exalted level cultivator to assault Zhao Batian instead.<br>&ldquo;He intends to clash head-on with Zhao Batian? He has really picked the wrong opponent this time!&rdquo;<br>There were several peak Utmost Exalted level and even Martial Exalted level cultivators amongst the crowd. They were able to swiftly deduce Chu Feng&rsquo;s intention, but they shook their heads to express their disapproval toward his decision.<br>Typically speaking, Demon Armaments tended to conflict with Divine Powers, but it just so happened that the Turquoiseflame Demon Saber that Zhao Batian obtained by coincidence was extremely compatible with Zhao Batian&rsquo;s Divine Power.<br>The resonance between the two powers caused Zhao Batian&rsquo;s prowess to be greatly increased when using his Divine Power and the Turquoiseflame Demon Saber together.<br>Furthermore, Zhao Batian had always been an avid saber practitioner ever since he was still young, and he devoted all of his efforts into mastering the saber. To date, he had already learned over a thousand saber skills.<br>Any weapon in his hand would have increased his fighting prowess, but if the weapon was a saber, it went far beyond just that. His skills with the saber would amplify terrifying might manyfold.<br>For this reason, everyone felt that Chu Feng had chosen the wrong opponent to confront directly.<br>Klang klang klang!<br>While everyone was shaking their heads at this situation, Chu Feng had already walked right up to Zhao Batian. With the cold glints of blade flashing across the sky, the two of them had started clashing with one another.<br>Wuahhh!<br>The two of them simply crossed swords several times, and all of a sudden, Zhao Batian was knocked flying like a shooting star before crashing heavily onto the ground.<br>The sheer force of his fall caused a cloud of dust to rise into the air, and the flat ground turned into a deep crater.<br>What was even shocking was that there were many blade wounds on Zhao Batian&rsquo;s body, some of them light lacerations while the more severe ones sliced right down to his bone.<br>In contrast, Chu Feng and his humble-looking Incomplete Exalted Armament stood calmly in the air as he gazed down at Zhao Batian from above, reminiscent of a victor ridiculing the defeated.<br>&ldquo;That lad is actually that powerful?&rdquo;<br>Those who hadn&rsquo;t known Chu Feng before began to shudder in fear at the strength he had displayed. Be it the old or the young, they were all shaken by this sight.<br>They knew just how terrifying of a fighter Zhao Batian was. His reputation as a prodigious cultivator definitely wasn&rsquo;t just hearsay. For this reason, they were looking forward to watching this fight.<br>Some of the onlookers did consider the possibility that Zhao Batian might have been defeated, but no one expected the battle to conclude in such a fast and decisive manner.<br>The reputed genius in saber skills, Zhao Batian, was actually utterly helpless before Chu Feng!<br></p></div>
