        <div><span>: Grandmother&rsquo;s Artwork</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>As soon as the portrait was unfurled, Bai Yunqing gasped in amazement.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Waa, Lord Jie Ranqing sure is a ravishing beauty. With her looks and talents, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that there&rsquo;s anyone in the world who is a match for her!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng was much more focused on the portrait, as this was his first time seeing his own mother. It sparked a tingle in his chest. The woman in the portrait, as beautiful as she might be, was his mother, and he felt an indescribable feeling of intimacy toward her.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, your mother is really pretty. She&rsquo;s much better looking than your father. It&rsquo;s a pity that you resemble your father more, or else you could have bedazzled innocent girls with your pretty boy looks,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>Those weren&rsquo;t just empty words. The woman in the portrait had an ethereal aura that </span><span>made her seem more like a fairy than a mortal.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Yu suddenly spoke up. He noticed that Chu Feng was too immersed in the portrait.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Haha! It looks like big brother Chu Feng is really fond of Lord Jie Ranqing!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing burst into laughter.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense!&rdquo; Chu Feng glared at Bai Yunqing.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing was taken aback. This was the first time Chu Feng had expressed anger at him after they became close friends.</span><br><span>Chu Feng had done this instinctively because he couldn&rsquo;t allow anyone to crack such jokes about his mother, but on further thought, Bai Yunqing also didn&rsquo;t know about their relationship either. So, he reined in his anger and said, &ldquo;Brother Bai, I have nothing but respect for Lord Jie Ranqing. She&rsquo;s our role model. Please don&rsquo;t crack such jokes in the future.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, please don&rsquo;t be angry. I have nothing but respect for Lord Jie Ranqing. You also know that she&rsquo;s my idol! I don&rsquo;t mean any disrespect to her. Speaking of which, big brother Chu Feng, you resemble Lord Jie Ranqing quite a bit. I mean, you definitely aren&rsquo;t as good-looking as her, but I can see some similarities in the features. What do you think, Jie Yu?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>Jie Yu alternated his gaze between Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s portrait and Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Now that you said that, there is some resemblance between them,&rdquo; he remarked in surprise.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do we really look alike? It&rsquo;s my honor to resemble Lord Jie Ranqing,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a chuckle. In his mind, however, he thought, &lsquo;</span><br><span>How could I possibly not look like my own mother?&rsquo;</span><br><span>Jie Yu and Bai Yunqing also didn&rsquo;t think too much about it, since there were plenty of people out there who looked similar to each other despite not sharing any blood ties. The world was big enough for such things to happen.</span><br><span>Jie Yu rolled up the portrait before asking the two of them, &ldquo;Do you still remember Lord Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s appearance?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;What are you asking? We just saw Lord Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s portrait, so how could we possibly not&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s words suddenly trailed to a halt. &ldquo;What the heck? Why can&rsquo;t I remember Lord Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s appearance?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng also tried to recall the portrait, but he couldn&rsquo;t remember what Jie Ranqing looked like. The more he tried to recall her appearance, the more blurry his recollection of her became. It was almost as if there was a formation preventing him from recalling his mother&rsquo;s appearance, but the formation was simply too intangible for him to breach.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The paper itself is a treasure, and it has a formation constructed on it. Only True Dragon World Spiritist will be able to remember Lord Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s appearance from it,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The hell! Even Lord Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s portrait has such protection placed on them. It looks like the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is really protective of her,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing exclaimed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Pui! Protective, my ass,&rdquo; Eggy spat.</span><br><span>While the world might not know the truth, she and Chu Feng knew better than that. Jie Ranqing had been imprisoned by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span><br><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng tried to breach the formation to remember his mother&rsquo;s appearance, but it was to no avail.</span><br><span>Jie Yu might have sensed his efforts from the serious look on his face because he chuckled and said, &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll give the painting to you since you&rsquo;re that fond of it.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you certain?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked, knowing that Jie Yu treasured the portrait too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;To be frank, I wouldn&rsquo;t give it to anyone else. I had to pull quite a few connections in order to get my hands on it. Not only was it drawn on a precious treasure, but it was also a personal artwork from Lord Nian Qing,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing was stunned. &ldquo;Lord Nianqing&rsquo;s personal artwork? It must be worth a lot!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Nianqing?&rdquo; Chu Feng was confused.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, it can&rsquo;t be that you don&rsquo;t know who Lord Nianqing is too?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing groaned.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Nianqing is Lord Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s mother!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing exclaimed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo; Jie Yu nodded.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh? Doesn&rsquo;t that mean that she&rsquo;s your grandmother?&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng felt conflicted upon hearing that. He should have felt a sense of intimacy toward his grandmother too, but he didn&rsquo;t know what role his grandmother played regarding his mother&rsquo;s incarceration.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I can sense how much you admire Lord Jie Ranqing. I&rsquo;ll give this portrait to you as an apology for my previous disrespect,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That is a matter of the past, and you have already apologized to me. However, I do want the portrait, so I won&rsquo;t turn down your goodwill. You have my gratitude for this gift.&rdquo; Chu Feng took the portrait Jie Yu had offered him and stowed it away.</span><br><span>Following that, Jie Yu proceeded to share some information regarding the Ancient Palace with the two of them.</span><br><span>The Ancient Palace was an excellent training location too, far surpassing the trial where they had previously been to. The method of training was also similar. They would have to collect a container to store cultivation resources tomorrow at the entrance of the Ancient Palace.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing was even more interested to enter the Ancient Palace too upon hearing that.</span><br><span>He was already close to making a breakthrough, and he did attempt it but it failed. He felt like he was still lacking something. There was a high chance that he could advance to </span><span>Purple Dragon God-cloak if he could enter the Ancient Palace too.</span><br><span>The following day, Jie Yu brought Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing to the Ancient Palace.</span><br><span>As they walked through the ground, they realized that this place was much larger than they had expected. The Ancient Palace was located at the center of this land, but it still took them quite a while before they reached their destination.</span><br><span>Finally, they spotted the Ancient Palace sitting above the clouds. It was neither big nor glowing, yet there was an air of mystery shrouding it.</span><br><span>Quite a few people were already gathered in front of the Ancient Palace.</span><br><span>Chu Feng spotted Ling Sheng&rsquo;er, Yao Luo, and another lady who looked strikingly similar to Ling Sheng&rsquo;er. Needless to say, she was Ling Mo&rsquo;er.</span><br></p></div>
