        <h1>Chapter 3336</h1>
        <div> - Trump Card<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing about the matter regarding the Wuma Heavenly Clan, Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief felt a suffocating heaviness. After all, the Wuma Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief and the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief were close friends of many years.<br>It was not only the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief; even Chu Feng did not wish for the Wuma Heavenly Clan to be destroyed like that.<br>However, the two of them had no choice but to leave. Ignoring the fact that they did not have any ability to interfere in the matter, their Chu Heavenly Clan was also facing a crisis of their own.<br>The day of the showdown against the Fang Heavenly Clan was already approaching. Regardless of whether or not they would be able to stand victorious against the Fang Heavenly Clan, they must still return.<br>"Senior, do you know what cultivation the strongest experts of the Wuma Heavenly Clan's branch clan have?" On the way back, Chu Feng asked.<br>"The strongest person in the Wuma Heavenly Clan's branch clan is their current clan chief, Wuma Yantian. His cultivation is that of a rank eight Exalted. However, he is not an ordinary rank eight Exalted. That man is very powerful. He fought against a fellow rank eight Exalted before, and easily won."<br>"Furthermore, that man is very forceful and tyrannical. Otherwise, he wouldn't have made such an excessive demand of the Wuma Heavenly Clan to change their surname."<br>"Regardless, he is very difficult to handle," The Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief said.<br>"Actually, it's not that we have no way to settle this matter."<br>"After all, there's still a trump card in our hands," Chu Feng said.<br>"Trump card?" At that moment, there was immediately a change in the gaze of the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief. It was as if he had seen hope. Immediately, he asked, "Chu Feng, could it be that you have a way to handle this?"<br>"Senior, although the most precious treasure of the Ancient Era's remnant has been taken away by the Moon Immortal, and the others have all returned empty-handed, our trip has not been made in vain. Please have a look."<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he streaked his palm across his Cosmos Sack. Then, bodies of light that resembled fireflies began to hover in his palm.<br>Seeing those bodies of light, the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief's expression changed.<br>Those bodies of light were the cultivation resources that Chu Feng had forcibly demanded from the various grand experts.<br>"Senior, these are also rare cultivation treasures. While they are useless for someone of my cultivation, it will have an enormous effect on a senior like you."<br>"If you are able to refine all of these cultivation resources, your cultivation will definitely increase. At that time, you might be able to contend against the Wuma Heavenly Clan's branch clan's clan chief," Chu Feng said.<br>"Indeed, these are rare cultivation treasures."<br>At that moment, the gaze of the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief had changed completely. Joy and excitement filled his eyes.<br>As an Exalted-level expert, how could he not be able to tell how amazing those cultivation resources were?<br>The reason why he didn't take too much notice of them earlier was because he was worried about Liangqiu Chengfeng's injury, and then had been seriously injured himself. At that time, he did not bother to inspect those cultivation resources, and only knew that they were rare and difficult to come by, and didn't know how amazing they were.<br>However, those cultivation resources were now placed before him. Not only was he able to examine them close up, but he was also able to clearly sense how powerful they were.<br>Indeed, they were rare cultivation treasures. They could practically guarantee that his cultivation would rise to rank six Exalted.<br>In fact, it was even possible for them to help boost his cultivation to rank seven Exalted.<br>However, even if he really managed to become a rank seven Exalted, he would still not be a match for the Wuma Heavenly Clan's branch clan.<br>That said, it remained that those cultivation treasures guaranteed that he would definitely be able to become a rank six Exalted. This was enough to make him wild with joy.<br>On the path of martial cultivation, every step further was as difficult as ascending to the heavens. For many people, they would be stuck at a certain level of cultivation and fail to make any progress for the rest of their lives no matter how hard they tried.<br>Those cultivation resources, on the other hand, were able to guarantee that he would become a rank six Exalted. As such, how could he not be overjoyed?<br>The only regret he had was that even if he managed to become a rank six Exalted, or even a rank seven Exalted, he would still not be able to assist the Wuma Heavenly Clan.<br>"Senior, look carefully."<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly flipped his wrist. Then, those cultivation resources all gathered in one location. In the end, from countless firefly-sized bodies of light, they gathered into a body of light that was about the size of a goose egg.<br>Not only did the light that they were emitting become more enchanting, but the power that they emitted also became even more intense.<br>"Heavens, this..."<br>Seeing the transformation of the cultivation resources, the expression of the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief changed enormously. The word 'disbelief' was written all over his face.<br>The reason for that was because he discovered that this minor action from Chu Feng had caused an overwhelming change to the cultivation resources.<br>If the cultivation resources were capable of guaranteeing an increase of his cultivation to rank six Exalted and possibly even rank seven Exalted, then after the change, those cultivation resources would guarantee a cultivation increase to rank seven Exalted, and potentially rank eight Exalted. In fact, there was even a chance of him being able to reach rank nine Exalted to become a peak Exalted-level expert.<br>Most importantly, all of this was capable of being achieved in a very short period of time!!!<br>With this, how could the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief not be astonished?<br>"Chu Feng, how did you accomplish this?" The Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief looked to Chu Feng with an expression of disbelief. He simply did not dare to believe his eyes.<br>It wasn't that he was a person lacking experience and easily astonished, it was simply that it was too miraculous.<br>Those cultivation resources were simply too powerful, so powerful that they surpassed his expectations, surpassed his imagination.<br>"Senior, while this junior was deciphering the Ancient Era's remnant's spirit formations, I managed to gain some comprehension. Because of that, I learned of how powerful those cultivation resources were. That is also the reason why this junior demanded all of the cultivation resources from those people," Chu Feng said.<br>"So that's the case. Chu Feng, you are truly worthy of being Hanxian's grandson. Even though this old man had high expectations of you, you continue to bring pleasant surprises that surpass the expectations of this old man repeatedly."<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief was truly overjoyed.<br>He finally realized why Chu Feng said that they still had a trump card. Indeed, those treasures were a trump card capable of allowing them to turn the situation around.<br>However, soon, the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief calmed down from his state of joy. With a serious expression, he said to Chu Feng, "No. Chu Feng, this old man cannot use those cultivation resources."<br>"Sooner or later, you will also become an Exalted. These cultivation resources are also extremely useful for you."<br></p></div>
