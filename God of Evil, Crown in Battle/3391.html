        <div> - The Gathering Of Geniuses<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After discovering the commotion outside, Chu Feng turned his gaze outward.<br>Even though he was inside the entrance of the rat zodiac, the others, including even existences like the Queen Mother Fox Immortal and Wuming Xingyun, were unable to see him. Meanwhile, Chu Feng was able to see outside with full clarity.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was able to see figures exiting that spirit formation gate in succession.<br>Ultimately, a total of eighty-eight individuals walked out from the spirit formation gate. Likely, they were people that had passed the evaluation.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected that girl to be among them.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the eighty-eight people, the corners of Chu Feng&rsquo;s lips rose into a smile.<br>The reason for that was because there was a person among the eighty-eight individuals that Chu Feng recognized.<br>It was Wuma Shengjie.<br>After being captured and imprisoned by the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen while ascending the mountain path to the Ice Summit, Chu Feng was worried that Wuma Shengjie and the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief might&rsquo;ve also been met with injustice.<br>However, judging from the present situation, Chu Feng&rsquo;s worries were needless.<br>That said, it was worthy of mentioning that the person who had entered a conflict with Chu Feng on the path to the Ice Summit and led to Chu Feng&rsquo;s imprisonment in the Fire Prison, that Xu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s young master, was not among the eighty-eight individuals.<br>This meant that that guy had not managed to pass the evaluation.<br>&hellip;...<br>After exiting the spirit formation gate, the eighty-eight individuals did not immediately move out. Instead, they stood in an orderly manner. It seemed like they were waiting for something.<br>That said, as they were waiting, they also began to look to the twelve zodiac entrances.<br>Of course, there were also people that looked to the other spirit formation gate that was opening before them.<br>Finally, the spirit formation gate opened completely. Then, a total of ten figues walked out from the spirit formation gate in succession.<br>They were six men and four women.<br>Chu feng had met all six of those men before.<br>They were respectively...<br>The third ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Linghu Tiemian.<br>The fifth ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Linghu Mingye.<br>The sixth ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Linghu Lun.<br>The seventh ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Mengyan Wushuang.<br>The eighth ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Tongtian Yuanming.<br>And the ninth ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Tang Zhenghao.<br>As for the four women, two of them were devastating beauties capable of causing the downfall of a city or state.<br>One had a very innocent and adorable appearance. Yet, she gave off an air of arrogance. On her waist was the title plate of the Linghu Heavenly Clan. Likely, she should be the strongest female among the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, the second ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Linghu Yueyue.<br>As for the other beauty, she gave off an extraordinary air, and appeared very cultured and refined. Likely, she was the fourth ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er.<br>Thus, apart from the first ranked Linghu Hongfei and the tenth ranked Li Anzhi, all of the Ancestral Martial Decastars were gathered there.<br>Of course, Chu Feng knew very well that Linghu Hongfei was actually already there. Thus, the only person absent was Li Anzhi.<br>As for the other two women, although they were not among the Ancestral Martial Decastars, they were also famous within the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>They were the two youngest disciples of Grandmaster Liangqiu, the two disciples that he favored the most, Liangqiu Lanyue and Liangqiu Hongyue.<br>The two of them did not participate in the evaluation, but had received preferential treatment like the Ancestral Martial Decastars.<br>That said, with the status and strength that the sisters possessed, they were indeed qualified to obtain such preferential treatment.<br>&ldquo;Look! It&rsquo;s the Ancestral Martial Decastars! Never would I have expected so many of them to have come here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Look at those two, aren&rsquo;t they the personal disciples of Grandmaster Liangqiu, Liangqiu Lanyue and Liangqiu Hongyue?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected even them to have come here.&rdquo;<br>The appearance of the Ancestral Martial Decastars and the Liangqiu Sisters stirred up the emotions of many of the people present.<br>Even though the people that managed to pass the evaluation were all people with extraordinary identities and strength, it remained that the Ancestral Martial Decastars were the Ancestral Martial Decastars.<br>At that moment, the people that came from the same clans as the Ancestral Martial Decastars or were acquainted with them all walked toward them to chat.<br>There were also people that did not know them that walked up to them to greet them.<br>Wuma Shengjie was the only one who paid no attention to the Ancestral Martial Decastars. In fact, she even paid no attention to the Liangqiu Sisters that she could be said to be acquainted with.<br>However, this was in accordance with her character.<br>She was observing the twelve zodiac entrances. She seemed to be making a selection. Ultimately, her eyes turned to the tiger zodiac&rsquo;s entrance.<br>&ldquo;Girl, do not choose that tiger zodiac&rsquo;s entrance. Come in the rat zodiac&rsquo;s entrance.&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, a voice transmission entered Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s ears.<br>Hearing that voice, her expression immediately changed. The reason for that was because she had managed to tell that it was Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, is it you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;<br>Wuma Shengjie was overjoyed at this turn of events. She clearly remembered that he had been captured and sent to the Fire Prison.<br>However, she was only able to hear Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice, and was unable to tell where he was. As such, she began to survey her surroundings in order to seek him out.<br>&ldquo;Girl, I am fine now. I&rsquo;m inside the rat zodiac&rsquo;s entrance right now. There&rsquo;s a spirit formation covering this entrance. Not only will you not be able to see me, but your voice transmission will also not reach me. However, you should be able to receive my voice transmission.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come into the rat zodiac&rsquo;s entrance later. I will explain things to you in detail,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Chu Feng was still trying to open the entrance to the hidden path, still setting up the unsealing formation.<br>Even though he had already concealed his unsealing formation, he could not leave it alone for the sake of avoiding issues from emerging. As such, he could only remain in the rat zodiac&rsquo;s entrance, and could not go out to see Wuma Shengjie. Thus, he could only call out to her through voice transmission to tell her to come in and find him.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; after hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice transmission, Wuma Shengjie nodded. Then, she turned her gaze to the rat zodiac&rsquo;s entrance.<br>&ldquo;Aiyo, it seems that all you little fellows have quite a good relationship with one another.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice was suddenly heard. At the same time, an enchanting aroma arrived.<br>Accompanying that enchanting aroma was an alluring figure. It was Queen Mother Fox Immortal. Like a celestial fairy, she whirled and landed before the crowd.<br></p></div>
