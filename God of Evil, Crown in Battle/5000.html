        <h1>Chapter 4999</h1>
        <div>: Yin Ren&rsquo;s Scheme<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Who is it, elder?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Sagacious,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother replied.<br>&ldquo;Are you referring to the Sagacious Grandmaster?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother replied.<br>Not only did Chu Feng know who the Sagacious Grandmaster was, but he had met with the latter too. Thinking back, that was also his first encounter with Wang Yuxian and those from the Dao Sea.<br>The Sagacious Grandmaster was a renowned existence in the Nine Souls Galaxy, rumored to be a world spiritist that equaled the Wretched Black Demon. Chu Feng&rsquo;s impression of him was an unfathomable expert.<br>&ldquo;Elder, do you know where we can find the Sagacious Grandmaster?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course. It&rsquo;s just that Yin Ren is not an easy person to deal with. Even I don&rsquo;t have the absolute confidence that I&rsquo;ll be able to curb him. Why don&rsquo;t you ask my master for help instead?&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother asked.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster doesn&rsquo;t intend to interfere in my personal affairs,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;I see&hellip; Don&rsquo;t worry. Your problems are ours as well. We&rsquo;ll help you resolve this matter.&rdquo;<br>Despite Godwish Grandmother&rsquo;s earlier lack of confidence, she still decisively promised to help Chu Feng on this matter.<br>In truth, Chu Feng also knew that it was risky for them to go against Master Yin Ren, but he had no other choice. Xian Miaomiao was in danger at the moment, and Chu Feng had no idea what Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s final goal was.<br>He wanted to save Xian Miaomiao from Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s clutches as soon as possible.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be counting on you then, elder,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s no need to stand on ceremony with me. We were the ones who did wrong. If anything, we&rsquo;re thankful that you&rsquo;re willing to give us a chance to make up for our faults. Let&rsquo;s not waste any time and set off right away. If you wish to meet Yin Ren, we&rsquo;ll have to reach our destination before Sagacious comes out of his closed-door training. Otherwise, we might just miss him,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother said.<br>The group quickly set off.<br>They chatted along the way, and Chu Feng soon learned why the Godwish Grandmother was confident that they would be able to meet Master Yin Ren at where the Sagacious Grandmaster was.<br>It turned out that Master Yin Ren had once approached the Godwish Grandmother for help on a certain matter, but the latter turned him down. The only other person in the entire Nine Souls Galaxy who could help him on that matter was the Sagacious Grandmaster.<br>The Sagacious Grandmaster had a curious habit of going into closed-door training in fixed intervals. Regardless of whether his cultivation was successful or not, he would always come out of his closed-door training and wander around a little.<br>Those who were acquainted with the Sagacious Grandmaster knew of this quirk of his.<br>Since Master Yin Ren was planning on enlisting the Sagacious Grandmaster&rsquo;s help, he would surely camp outside where the Sagacious Grandmaster was having his closed-door trianing so as to ensure that he would be able to meet the latter.<br>&ldquo;Elder, may I know what is it that Yin Ren asked your help for?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought of Yin Ren as a small fry even though he has the Nine Souls Sacred Clan as his backing. That day, in order to prove to me that he has the qualification to work together with me he revealed his prowess as a rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist.<br>&ldquo;It was then that I realized that I&rsquo;ve underestimated him. Yin Ren had been hiding his full capabilities all this while. People like him wouldn&rsquo;t reveal his cards easily. For someone like him to willingly expose himself, it could only mean that he urgently requires my help. He even promised me a position that towers above the entire Eastern Region.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that he didn&rsquo;t elaborate much on what he was intending to do, so I&rsquo;m not too sure what he&rsquo;s up to. But if one thing is for sure, it&rsquo;s bound to stir huge repercussions. Perhaps&hellip; he might even be planning to overthrow the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really have a good impression of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan either, but I don&rsquo;t want to get myself involved in something like that. So, I turned him down.<br>&ldquo;Ah, there was also another reason why I turned him down. It would appear that the Wretched Black Demon has joinedhands with him too, and I personally despise the Wretched Black Demon. That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t want to work with him,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother said.<br>&ldquo;The Wretched Black Demon is working together with Yin Ren?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was shocked to hear that.<br>He was enemies with the Wretched Black Demon, so there was no way he wouldn&rsquo;t know who he was. The Wretched Black Demon was arrogant, but he had the strength to back up his attitude. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been put on the same pedestal as the Sagacious Grandmaster.<br>Chu Feng would have never expected someone like the Wretched Black Demon to join hands with Master Yin Ren. That made him even more curious what Master Yin Ren was up to.<br>&ldquo;Now that I think about it, there was a gleam of murderous intent in Yin Ren&rsquo;s eyes after I turned him down. However, that&rsquo;s only normal. People like him abhors other learning of their secrets, so it&rsquo;s only normal that he would want to get rid of me after everything he has divulged to me.<br>&ldquo;He eventually decided against making a move on me though. He probably wasn&rsquo;t confident of defeating me, so he simply warned me not to tell anyone about this before taking his leave,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother said.<br>&ldquo;I never thought that Yin Ren would have such ambitions. If that&rsquo;s true, it would mean that he&rsquo;s only making use of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei remarked deeply.<br>Chu Feng was curious to know what Yin Ren&rsquo;s goal was too, but it wasn&rsquo;t really that important. He had already placed Yin Ren into his kill list, which meant that he had already made up his mind to take the latter&rsquo;s life regardless of his identity or goals.<br></p></div>
