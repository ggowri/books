        <h1>Chapter 1702</h1>
        <div> - Baili Xuankong<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Senior, you&rsquo;re actually&hellip;&rdquo; At this moment, Chu Feng was utterly overjoyed by this sudden turn of events. He was already unable to describe what he was currently feeling.<br>It turned out that this mysterious old man was actually someone from the Cyanwood Mountain. From this, Chu Feng felt that this mysterious old man would definitely help him..<br>Upon thinking about how he actually possessed such a powerful backer, Chu Feng, who was currently still wanted by the Nangong Imperial Clan, felt a lot more at ease.<br>It was as if a homeless child had finally found shelter. Furthermore, the shelter he had found was capable of standing up for him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, allow me to introduce them to you. This is our Cyanwood Sacred Assembly&rsquo;s Elder Guan Hong,&rdquo; Dugu Xingfeng pointed at the red-faced old man and introduced him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng pays his respects to Elder Guan Hong,&rdquo; Chu Feng immediately clasped his fist respectfully toward that old man. As this person was an elder of the Cyanwood Sacred Assembly, it was only natural for Chu Feng to greet him respectfully. After all, in terms of status, he could be said to be Chu Feng&rsquo;s senior, as Chu Feng was still a disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain.<br>While that red-faced old man had a very fierce appearance, the gaze with which he looked to Chu Feng was very amiable. Furthermore, when Chu Feng bowed to greet him, he nodded his head in a very appreciative manner.<br>&ldquo;As for this person here, he is an amazing individual. He is our Cyanwood Sacred Assembly&rsquo;s Lord Assembly Master,&rdquo; Dugu Xingfeng looked to the white-faced old man and introduced him as well.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng was extremely shocked. He had originally thought that the old man who emitted the airs of an Immortal would be the Cyanwood Sacred Assembly&rsquo;s Assembly Master. However, it would appear that he had guessed wrong.<br>However, the Lord Assembly Master was clearly the most supreme existence of the Cyanwood Scared Assembly, the true controller of the Cyanwood Mountain.<br>If this white-faced old man was the Cyanwood Sacred Assembly&rsquo;s Assembly Master, then who would that old man with strength that was clearly stronger than him, and who was also wearing the attire of the Cyanwood Sacred Assembly, be?<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng pays his respects to Lord Assembly Master.&rdquo;<br>Even though confusion emerged in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart, he still hurriedly greeted that white-faced old man respectfully. The Cyanwood Sacred Assembly&rsquo;s Lord Assembly Master, regardless of whether it might be his status or position, they would both be the most supreme in the Cyanwood Mountain. Even Dugu Xingfeng would be greatly inferior to him.<br>As a disciple, it was already a great privilege for Chu Feng to meet the Lord Assembly Master. However, his Lord Assembly Master was actually protecting him from the shadows. This caused Chu Feng to feel extremely grateful.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, there is no need for you to be this courteous. This old man&rsquo;s name is Yin Chengkong. If little friend doesn&rsquo;t mind, you can address me as Senior Yin. There is no need for you to address me as Assembly Master, for it would only distance our relationship.&rdquo;<br>Compared to that Elder Guan Hong, this Lord Assembly Master was even more fond of Chu Feng. It could be seen that he thought very highly of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;As for this final person, he is even more amazing. There is no need for me to introduce him to you. Merely by telling you his name you will know all about him,&rdquo; After introducing the two old men, Dugu Xingfeng looked to that old man that gave off the airs of an Immortal and spoke in a deliberately mystifying manner. Then he said, &ldquo;This person here is Lord Baili Xuankong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Baili Xuankong?!!!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was immediately shocked upon hearing those words. He was truly incomparably shocked. It was as if an enormous wave had suddenly appeared on a calm lake.<br>Who was Baili Xuankong? Chu Feng had heard about this great individual&rsquo;s name since the moment he had first arrived in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>Baili Xuankong was the founder of the Southern Cyanwood Forest. He had once been one of the strongest people in the Cyanwood Mountain.<br>However, hadn&rsquo;t Baili Xuankong died long ago? How could he possibly appear before Chu Feng now?<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng had seen the sculpture of Baili Xuankong in the Ascension Sect&rsquo;s ancient pagoda. That sculpture was simply a completely different person from the Baili Xuankong before him right now.<br>&ldquo;I understand now,&rdquo; After guessing about it, Chu Feng came to a sudden realization. The reason for that was because that day when he entered the top of that ancient pagoda and had his back facing Baili Xuankong&rsquo;s sculpture, he had felt a gaze.<br>That gaze had originated from Baili Xuankong&rsquo;s sculpture. Even though Chu Feng had turned around and carefully examined the sculpture afterward, he had been unable to discover anything. Thus, at that time, Chu Feng had felt that it was only a misperception.<br>However, right now, when he was facing this Baili Xuankong, he felt that Baili Xuankong&rsquo;s gaze was exactly the same as the gaze he had felt in the ancient pagoda.<br>Sure enough, this old man was Baili Xuankong. Not only had the founder of the Southern Cyanwood Forest not died, he had also become an expert with the cultivation of rank three Martial Emperor, a top expert capable of contending against the Nangong Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Nangong Beidou, a person who could be ranked among the top existences in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>&ldquo;This Southern Cyanwood Forest&rsquo;s disciple pays his respects to Lord Ancestor,&rdquo; Suddenly, Chu Feng was about to kneel down to Baili Xuankong to pay his respects to him. The reason for that was because Baili Xuankong was truly a very influential person to Chu Feng.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng was not considering himself as a disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain when he said those words. Rather, he was considered himself as a disciple of the Southern Cyanwood Forest. After all, the old man before him was the founder of the Southern Cyanwood Forest.<br>&ldquo;My, Chu Feng, we are family; there is no need for you to be this overly courteous. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll make it appear as if we are strangers,&rdquo; However, before Chu Feng could kneel to him, Baili Xuankong personally reached out to Chu Feng and stopped him from kneeling. The fondness he had for Chu Feng was completely self-evident.<br>&ldquo;Lord Ancestor, Chu Feng really never expected that you were still alive. If the people from the Southern Cyanwood Forest were to know about this, I truly do not know how excited they would be,&rdquo; What Chu Feng said was what he was feeling from the bottom of his heart.<br>Before Chu Feng had appeared, the Southern Cyanwood Forest could be said to have suffered all sorts of humiliation. Even after Chu Feng became very famous, the Southern Cyanwood Forest had still not become as extravagant as Chu Feng had imagined it to be.<br>However, if they were to find out that the founder of the Southern Cyanwood Forest was still alive, who would dare to bully the Southern Cyanwood Forest? Likely, even the elders from the Cyanwood Mountain would become extremely respectful toward the Southern Cyanwood Forest.<br>&ldquo;Haha, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether they know about this or not. What matters is that you know about this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, we had actually met each other already. I had already met you back in the Ascension Sect&rsquo;s pagoda,&rdquo; Baili Xuankong said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Junior still remembers that. Merely, Lord Ancestor, that sculpture does not resemble you at all,&rdquo; Chu Feng apoke the question in his heart aloud.<br>&ldquo;That sculpture is simply not me. Instead, it&rsquo;s a sculpture of my close friend,&rdquo; Baili Xuankong said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case. Ancestor, Chu Feng has another question. That day, the person who saved us in the Cursed Soil Sect, was that you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>This was a question that Chu Feng has had in his heart the entire time. He had always felt that it was not a coincidence that they had been saved that day. Instead, someone had purposely been helping them.<br>Chu Feng had wanted to know who it was that helped them the entire time. The way it seemed now, the person who had most likely helped them would be this Baili Xuankong. After all, Baili Xuankong possessed both the strength and relationship to help them.<br>There were reasons for Baili Xuankong to act and save Chu Feng and the others. Furthermore, Baili Xuankong possessed the strength to save Chu Feng and the others.<br>&ldquo;It was indeed I,&rdquo; Baili Xuankong nodded while smiling. Then, he said, &ldquo;When you entered the ancient pagoda, I was in closed-door training. I was desirous of reaching a breakthrough. Thus, I did not come out to find you.<br>&ldquo;However, I was worried about you the entire time, and wanted to know whether or not you were able to become a talent, whether or not you were the person I was waiting for.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When I exited my closed-door training, it just so happened to be the day when the Nine Powers Hunt had ended. Even though I did not manage to see your elegance in the Nine Powers Hunt, I did manage to see the battle between you and Qin Wentian.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your cultivation has increased enormously fast, many times faster than I anticipated.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, I concluded that I was not mistaken in establishing the Southern Cyanwood Forest, that I had not waited all these years in vain. After so long, I&rsquo;ve finally managed to find a disciple that is worthy for me to nurture.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I did not wish for you to know about my existence. I feared that you would feel arrogant after knowing that I would protect you, and provoke troubles for no reason.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I began to follow you from the shadows. Thus, I know about practically all of the things you encountered later on.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, I do not know about what happened inside the Extremely Poisonous Sea of Clouds,&rdquo; Baili Xuankong said with a smile.<br></p></div>
