        <div> - Plan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;The Holy Light Clan is not qualified?&rdquo;<br>Not only was Chu Feng astonished to hear those words, even Yu Ting was astonished.<br>Although she was a disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, she still knew that the ruler of the Holy Light Galaxy was the Holy Light Clan.<br>Since they&rsquo;re the ruler, they must be the strongest power in the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>Not even she knew that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was so powerful to not even give face to the Holy Light Clan.<br>&ldquo;Master, in that case, it would mean that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect has grown so powerful that they do not even fear the Holy Light Clan?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng felt pressure.<br>Since the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was planning to harm Zi Ling, it would mean that they&rsquo;re his enemy.<br>If the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was truly that powerful, it was most definitely not good news for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This old man doesn&rsquo;t know if the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect fears the Holy Light Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the strength of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect could always be described with a single word.&rdquo;<br>Hearing that, Chu Feng immediately asked, &ldquo;What word?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfathomable,&rdquo; said Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Unfathomable?!&rdquo;<br>Hearing that description, Chu Feng felt even more uneasy.<br>After all, compared to a power that one already knew the strength of, a power that was unfathomable was even more dangerous.<br>But, even though that was the case, Chu Feng still didn&rsquo;t give up.<br>&ldquo;Master, could you bring me over to check out the teleportation formation that could allow one to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, your master I will not lie to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unless you become a rank four Utmost Exalted, you wouldn&rsquo;t even be qualified to enter that spirit formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, the cultivation of rank four Utmost Exalted is only the bare minimum required to enter it. It does not mean that you will be able to come out unscathed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As your master, I do not agree for you to go there.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No matter how capable you are, this old man felt that you will need the cultivation of at least rank seven Utmost Exalted to challenge that spirit formation,&rdquo; said Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Master, in that case, do you know of any method to quickly increase one&rsquo;s cultivation?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;If I knew of a method to quickly increase one&rsquo;s cultivation, I wouldn&rsquo;t be unable to take my revenge even now,&rdquo; Ox-nosed Old Daoist had a wry smile on his face as he said those words.<br>Hearing that, Chu Feng felt very helpless.<br>He knew that he was being too anxious and rushing to get things done.<br>How could there possibly be shortcuts in the path of martial cultivation?<br>If there were really shortcuts, his father wouldn&rsquo;t have had him learn through experience on his own.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Yu Ting, the two of you don&rsquo;t have to worry too much.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man had met the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;According to my understanding of her, she possesses an exceptionally good nature and is someone who treasures talents a whole lot.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since that Zi Ling girl was able to become her personal disciple, it is obvious how highly the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster regarded her as.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, she&rsquo;s only teaching that Zi Ling girl a lesson. She will not take her life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps by the time the two of you entered the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, that Zi Ling would&rsquo;ve already been released and returned to becoming a top figure in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It might even be possible for the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster to agree to having Zi Ling leave the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to find you,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Senior, are you really certain that our Lady Sectmaster is that sensible?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Would Lady Sectmaster really be willing to release Zi Ling?&rdquo;<br>The reason why Yu Ting asked that was because the Lady Sectmaster she knew was a cold-hearted and emotionless person.<br>She was someone that all the disciples and elders of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect feared from the bottom of their hearts.<br>The description &lsquo;sensible&rsquo; was practically unseen on their Lady Sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Little girl, while you might be a disciple of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, your understanding of your Lady Sectmaster might not necessarily be better than this old man.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Trust this old man. My judgement cannot be wrong. Your Lady Sectmaster is most definitely someone who cherishes talents.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unless that girl Zi Ling really did something that she was unable to tolerate, she will not take her life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The fact that that Zi Ling girl is still alive right now meant that things are not that serious,&rdquo; said Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Hearing those words, Yu Ting felt what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said to be rather reasonable.<br>Even though the Lady Sectmaster in her impression was someone very cold, she agrees that her Lady Sectmaster was someone who values talented individuals.<br>Truth is, Yu Ting also knew that Zi Ling will not be in fatal danger for the time being.<br>But, she was still worried about what sort of torment Zi Ling will endure being imprisoned in a place like that. That was also the reason why she was so pained.<br>Seeing how anxious Chu Feng looked, Yu Ting felt very guilty.<br>After all, if she didn&rsquo;t come to seek out Chu Feng, he wouldn&rsquo;t be in such pressure.<br>Of course, Yu Ting didn&rsquo;t care about all that at the beginning. She didn&rsquo;t care about Chu Feng&rsquo;s life and death at all. All she cared about was Zi Ling&rsquo;s safety.<br>But, after interacting with Chu Feng, Yu Ting gained a new opinion of him.<br>Even though they&rsquo;ve only interacted with each other for a short period of time, Yu Ting had realized why Zi Ling loved Chu Feng so dearly.<br>Chu Feng does possess aspects superior to other people. It was not only his talent. He also possessed a charisma that was unpresent in others.<br>Even Yu Ting began to subconsciously consider Chu Feng to be a close friend.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I feel what your master said to be very correct.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Saving Zi Ling is indeed not something that could be accomplished in a rush.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve told you before, while Zi Ling is imprisoned in the Land of Abandonment, she&rsquo;s only imprisoned there. Lady Sectmaster never mentioned any desire to take Zi Ling&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, Lady Sectmaster was indeed very fond of Zi Ling. Her fondness toward Zi Ling far surpassed that of any other disciple.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As such, you don&rsquo;t have to be too anxious in saving Zi Ling. Else, you&rsquo;ll end up harming yourself. If that is to happen, Zi Ling would feel very sad too,&rdquo; Yu Ting actually comforted Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, your master I know that, with your personality, you will likely only be at ease by seeing Zi Ling being fine with your very eyes.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re a smart child. You knew that you cannot rush this matter. Thus, calm yourself and steadily increase your cultivation. That is the best method to save Zi Ling.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, Zi Ling is currently the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster&rsquo;s personal disciple.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;According to my understanding of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster, she will not be willing to hand Zi Ling to you if you&rsquo;re not an outstanding person of the younger generation yourself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You understand what I mean by that?&rdquo; asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You all don&rsquo;t have to worry for me. I will definitely stand before Zi Ling in my best condition,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Following that, Chu Feng no longer continued to twist himself in this matter.<br>His plan was extremely clear. He needed to quickly increase his cultivation.<br>But, he will not wait till rank seven Utmost Exalted to challenge the spirit formation like the Ox-nosed Old Daoist suggested.<br>Since rank four Utmost Exalted was the qualification that was needed, Chu Feng will challenge it at rank four Utmost Exalted.<br>He was not concerned about dangers. He only cared about Zi Ling.<br>On their way to the Reincarnation Upper Realm, Chu Feng inquired the Ox-nosed Old Daoist about what happened back then.<br>Ox-nosed Old Daoist did not conceal what happened back then.<br>The course of events was as Chu Feng heard.<br>The reason why the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was defeated back then was indeed because he was poisoned.<br>Furthermore, even now, Ox-nosed Old Daoist had not been able to find the person who poisoned him.<br></p></div>
