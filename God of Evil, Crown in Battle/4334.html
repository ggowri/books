        <div>: A Weird Demand<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though the slit had appeared, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist didn&rsquo;t stabilize the formation right away to maintain it. Instead, he continued to drive the formation even after that.<br>Soon, he had already spent more time at this phase than the time it took for him to open up the slit, but it didn&rsquo;t seem like he had any intention of moving on anytime soon.<br>What left everyone perplexed was how even though the slit had already appeared, why hadn&rsquo;t the Ox-nosed Old Daoist allowed Chu Feng to enter so that they could coordinate with one another to open up the Dragon Vein Source for good?<br>Despite this, none of them dared to question the Ox-nosed Old Daoist about it. After all, whether the Dragon Vein Source could be opened or not this time around hinged entirely on him.<br>Other than believing in the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, there was nothing else they could do.<br>Of course, the crowd wouldn&rsquo;t be idling about during this period of time either. They tried ways to look beyond the slit in the hopes of uncovering the situation within the Dragon Vein Source.<br>However, the slit was pitch-black, and no matter what kind of means they tried, they were unable to peer into the situation within it. It was as if the slit was just a decoration sitting there, and that it didn&rsquo;t really lead into the Dragon Vein Source.<br>Just like that, six hours ticked by.<br>It was at this moment that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist finally turned his head over to look at Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;The two of you can head in now. Chu Feng, follow my instructions once you&rsquo;re inside,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;<br>Just like that, Chu Feng, together with Long Xiaoxiao, walked through the slit.<br>To the astonishment of the two of them, right after passing through the slit, they found themselves plunged into a world of darkness. Despite having passed through the slit, they didn&rsquo;t arrive at the Dragon Vein Source right away.<br>Everything was dark in here. Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao could see nothing but each other.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng could sense that there was a surge of energy that was sealing them within a small, confined space.<br>If they wanted to proceed any further, they would have to release this seal first.<br>However, the energy behind this seal was rather peculiar, such that Chu Feng actually found himself helpless before it.<br>However, what was fortunate was that within the energy that was sealing them, there were some vague, moving runes that appeared to be clues.<br>So, Chu Feng quickly released his spirit power to perceive the content of these moving runes.<br>A moment later, however, deep furrows appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead.<br>The moving runes weren&rsquo;t too difficult to understand. He was able to decipher their meaning with great ease.<br>The seal that was blocking them was a sort of yinyang spirit formation.<br>It was very easy to break this spirit formation. In fact, the method of doing so was recorded within the moving runes as well.<br>It was as if he had encountered a locked gate in his path, but the key was hanging on the wall right next to the locked gate.<br>That being said, this was where the tricky part came in.<br>To breach this formation, it would require two people to harmonize their powers together. On top of that, an ordinary harmonization wouldn&rsquo;t work. Those two people would have to bare their bodies to one another.<br>This left Chu Feng feeling incredibly awkward. Just what kind of darned condition was that?<br>If he were to tell Long Xiaoxiao this, the latter would surely think that he was a deviant pervert!<br>Chu Feng subconsciously shot a glance at Long Xiaoxiao.<br>Even though it was pitch-black in here, he was still able to see her clearly somehow. The latter&rsquo;s face was beet-red, and her head was lowered. She wasn&rsquo;t saying anything or moving at all.<br>Seeming to sense Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze, Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s already reddened face became even redder.<br>&ldquo;Ahh&hellip; By any chance, is it possible that Princess Xiaoxiao has also discovered the method to breach the formation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao nodded awkwardly.<br>&ldquo;The method to breach this formation is simply too weird. It might be a prank. Let&rsquo;s try to set up a formation normally and see if we can breach it first,&rdquo; Chu Feng proposed.<br>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao expressed her approval.<br>Having come to an agreement, the two of them immediately began to set up a formation based on what they understood of this yinyang spirit formation.<br>It had to be said that the formation they had set up while coordinating with one another was truly extraordinary.<br>Ordinary formations were shrouded in a layer of gold light, but this formation actually had white and blue lights interweaving with one another.<br>These two different types of energies harmonized with one another, complementing each other. Not only was it aesthetically pleasing, but it also emanated a sort of mysterious power.<br>After they successfully set up the formation, Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao unhesitatingly activated the formation, hoping to use it to tear through the energy that was trapping them.<br>However, it was ineffective.<br>Despite the formidable might of their formation, they were unable to breach the yinyang spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Why would this be? Do we really have to&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Before Long Xiaoxiao could finish her words, her face had already turned red yet again.<br>&ldquo;Let me head back to ask my master about this.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he prepared to return through the slit to ask the Ox-nosed Old Daoist about this, only to find that the slit had vanished too.<br>He immediately tried all of the means he had, but he was unable to find the slit at all.<br>They were really trapped here.<br>Seeing the tight frown on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face, Long Xiaoxiao asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The slit has disappeared. We won&rsquo;t be able to return anymore,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied<br>Weng!<br>Right after Chu Feng said those words, another surge of energy gushed in from the surroundings.<br>This was oppressive might coming from the yinyang spirit formation. It was extremely strong, such that it suffocated both Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually true?&rdquo;<br>As soon as Chu Feng felt the pressure, he immediately knew that things were bad.<br>Other than the method to breach the formation, he had also received another piece of information from the moving runes too&mdash;they only had an incense stick&rsquo;s time to breach the formation.<br>If they failed to breach the formation within that time, the energy within the formation would kill them.<br>&ldquo;Let me think about it, there must be a way out of this!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t blindly follow the solution that was given to him from the moving runes.<br>From the very start, he had already known that the formations he knew of wouldn&rsquo;t be able to overcome the energy that had trapped them. He had to calm down and think of another alternative method in order to overcome this crisis.<br>However, as time ticked by, Long Xiaoxiao seemed to have made up her mind.<br>&ldquo;Little benefactor, why don&rsquo;t we&hellip; just do as was stated in the runes?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked.<br>&ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t do. How can we do that?&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head vehemently.<br>&ldquo;Little benefactor, you can just turn your eyes away from me. Given your capabilities, you should be able to set up a formation even with your eyes closed, right?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, this won&rsquo;t do. It&rsquo;s not appropriate,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Do you scorn me? Or are you afraid that I&rsquo;ll see your body?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked.<br>&ldquo;I am a man, what do I have to fear? If you really want to see it, I can show it to you right now. But Xiaoxiao, you are a lady. I can&rsquo;t take advantage of you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>However, Long Xiaoxiao simply pouted her lips and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re obviously scorning me. Forget it then, let&rsquo;s just die in here together!&rdquo;<br>That lass was actually angry at him!<br></p></div>
