        <div>: Arriving at Dao Sea<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Well, this &lsquo;heavy price&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t cost Chu Feng his future nor his bloodline. What he would be losing was his looks.<br>The procedure would damage his soul, resulting in a permanent change in his looks. He would become an incredibly hideous individual.<br>That was the price that Chu Feng would have to pay.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I can ensure your safety, but I won&rsquo;t be able to restore your looks back to its original state. No world spiritist, no matter how formidable, will be able to help you, and no disguise means will be able to conceal your hideous looks. You may have to live your life with a mask on your face.<br>&ldquo;A person&rsquo;s looks might just be an exterior quality, but nevertheless, it can affect your entire life. I advise you to think it through properly. I&rsquo;m not the type of person who would force someone to do something against his will. If you aren&rsquo;t willing to pay this price, I&rsquo;ll permit you to leave right now,&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea told Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I have already made up my mind. It&rsquo;s just my exterior. As a man, there&rsquo;s no need for me to get too obsessed with my looks,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a resolute smile.<br>It would be a lie if Chu Feng were to say that he wasn&rsquo;t concerned about how he looked. However, if he could trade his<br>for a chance to save the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, he would be more than willing to make the trade.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. You were willing to even put your life on the line for this, so what do mere<br>count as?&rdquo;<br>The Lady of Dao Sea wasn&rsquo;t too surprised by Chu Feng&rsquo;s response.<br>With this, the two of them continued advancing toward the Dao Sea.<br>They traversed across great mountains, boundless deserts, and vast plains, and soon, they arrived above a blue ocean.<br>The surface of this ocean looked relatively calm. There were no towering waves or massive monstrous beasts. Instead, there were schools of fishes swimming around the place, and from to time, a seagull would swoop across the area.<br>On top of that, the color of the ocean looked very reminiscent to that of the sky, and its surface reflected the white clouds drifting across. This was very similar to the ocean on the Nine Provinces Continent.<br>Chu Feng had seen many precious treasures, natural oddities, beautiful yet mysterious plants, and all sorts of different monstrous beasts, but this seemingly ordinary sight caused nostalgia to well up inside his heart.<br>Having explored so many lands, he had seen a lot of fascinating sights. But it was the most simple sceneries that stayed with him in his heart and attracted him so.<br>This place was the Dao Sea.<br>Those residing in the Dao Sea rested on a seemingly ordinary island in the vicinity. This island had no towering tree on it, but instead, it was filled with flowers, plants, and all sorts of animals. It was a sight that bore a close resemblance to the place where Chu Feng had grown up in.<br>The Lady of Dao Sea traveled at an extremely fast speed, and all this while, she had been maintaining a concealed state. However, as she approached the island, she began to slow down and even revealed herself.<br>As soon as she appeared, numerous figures flew forth from the island toward them.<br>These were all familiar faces&mdash;Wang Yuxian, Song Feifei, and the other disciples who had been trapped with him at the Soaring Flower Gazebo the other day.<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to master!&rdquo;<br>Wang Yuxian and the others first bowed respectfully to the Lady of Dao Sea before turning their sights toward Chu Feng.<br>Upon seeing that Chu Feng had come here together with their master, their eyes widened in astonishment. They couldn&rsquo;t understand why Chu Feng would be together with their master.<br>&ldquo;My friend has already told me about your plight. If not for young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s help, you would have been killed by the demonic being the other day. I happened to meet young friend Chu Feng elsewhere, so I invited him to our Dao Sea as our guest. But judging by the way you are looking at him, could it be that you don&rsquo;t welcome your own benefactor here?&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course not! We&rsquo;re more than happy to have him here!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re here!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master, you must not know that I have given my token to young master Chu Feng the other day to invite him here as our guest!&rdquo;<br>Sweet smiles blossomed on the faces of the beautiful fairies. There were even a few of them who looked at Chu Feng with a deep gaze filled with intentions, and Song Feifei was one of them.<br>One thing of note was that Wang Yuxian still had the same nonchalant look on her face. While there was a smile on her lips too, it was very faint. It felt like she was simply smiling out of formality toward a guest instead of truly feeling joyful over Chu Feng&rsquo;s visit.<br>This lass had always been an unusual one amidst her peer.<br>The first time they met, while everyone looked upon Chu Feng in disdain, Wang Yuxian was the only one who continued treating him courteously.<br>When Chu Feng said that he could save them and told them to come over to his side, all of them immediately refused because they thought that Chu Feng was lying to them. Only Wang Yuxian chose to trust him.<br>And when Chu Feng saved their lives, their view of him immediately changed. Their eyes became filled with passion and intimacy.<br>Once again, it was only Wang Yuxian who still maintained her initial attitude toward him.<br>But somehow, despite Wang Yuxian&rsquo;s seemingly distant and polite attitude, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but find her rather unusual.<br>&ldquo;Take good care of your benefactor. He won&rsquo;t be with us for too long.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Lady of Dao Sea turned to Wang Yuxian and said, &ldquo;Lele, follow me.&rdquo;<br>Following that, the Lady of Dao Sea left the area together with Wang Yuxian.<br>Once they were gone, Song Feifei and the others immediately rushed forward and crowded around Chu Feng with an attitude that was even more passionate than before.<br>As their master was still around earlier, they still had to tone down a little, but now that she was no longer around, there was no need for them to hold themselves back anymore.<br>Every single one of them had a genuinely bright smile that had come straight from their hearts. Had any other man been around, he would have surely died of envy.<br>These were the disciples of the Lady of Dao Sea who were renowned for their beauty!<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, how did you meet our master?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, you sure are a formidable figure. I have grown up with my master since a very young age, but this is the first time I&rsquo;m seeing my master inviting someone over to our Dao Sea as a guest!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! This is also my first time seeing it too!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, could it be that you&rsquo;re friends with our master too?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng suddenly found himself bombarded with countless questions.<br>The disciples of the Lady of Dao Sea, who usually put on a cold front before strangers, were currently chirping endlessly around Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears. On the other hand, Chu Feng also didn&rsquo;t put on airs and started chatting with them too.<br>He told them about what he had encountered after parting with them.<br></p></div>
