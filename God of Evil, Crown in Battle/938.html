        <h1>Chapter 938</h1>
        <div> - Selecting a Sect Head<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Lady Piaomiao, Qiushui Fuyan, Qiu Canfeng, and Taikou were together to discuss the countermeasures against Murong Mingtian and Jiang Qisha.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy to refine any of the Imperial Tomb&rsquo;s cultivation resources. Although Chu Feng said it was sufficient to give him a day, is it truly possible to refine so many in such a short time?&rdquo;<br>Qiu Canfeng was a bit worried. He knew of the volatile power these resources contained. Many of them were so dangerous even he didn&rsquo;t dare to refine them.<br>&ldquo;Qiu Canfeng, it seems that you really don&rsquo;t know anything about your disciple! Chu Feng is the most monstrous young man I have ever seen in my entire life. He even refined the Natural Oddity no one dared to touch in the Burning Heaven Church. What do you think he<br>can&rsquo;t<br>refine?&rdquo; Lady Piaomiao said with a faint smile.<br>&ldquo;Natural Oddity?&rdquo; Qiu Canfeng&rsquo;s expression changed and a hint of shock emerged in his eyes. He of course knew of Natural Oddities, but he didn&rsquo;t know there was also a Natural Oddity within the Burning Heaven Church. However, based on her words just now, he could tell that the Natural Oddity was not an ordinary one.<br>&ldquo;Master, Senior Piaomiao, Senior Taikou, Sister Fuyan.&rdquo; A joyful call&mdash;Chu Feng had returned.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve made a breakthrough?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You continuously made two levels of breakthroughs, and became a rank seven Martial Lord?&rdquo;<br>All of them were amazed. They already knew Chu Feng was very freakish, but didn&rsquo;t expect him to be<br>this<br>freakish. When typical people cultivated in seclusion, they usually took several days, several months, even several years.<br>But Chu Feng had just used less than half a day, which was even quicker than his own initial projection. That truly surpassed their expectations.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve refined all of it?&rdquo; Qiu Canfeng asked with shock.<br>&ldquo;Mm, I refined all of it. I&rsquo;ve also gotten the Secret Skills.&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled as he nodded.<br>&ldquo;Haha, good, good! I, Qiu Canfeng, have truly received an excellent disciple!&rdquo; Qiu Canfeng couldn&rsquo;t even stop grinning after confirming what had happened. There was praise and pleased expressions within his eyes.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful that it&rsquo;s a success! Chu Feng, we&rsquo;ve already planned out how to deal with Murong Mingtian and the others. Come and look through it as well.&rdquo;<br>Lady Piaomiao completely and detailedly narrated their plan. Without a speck of doubt, Chu Feng was the pivotal point that decided their victory and defeat.<br>First, Chu Feng and Qiu Canfeng were to go to the Depraved Ravine and acquire the Demon Sealing Sword. Then, they were to think of a way to gather the ones who held some position in the Crippling Night Demon Sect. Finally, Qiu Canfeng would use his strength of a rank five Martial King to directly push Chu Feng into the role of sect head.<br>As for Qiushui Fuyan, she would go find the First Immortal with Taikou. With the condition of helping Ya Fei restore her physical body, they would have the First Immortal help them. Of course, they wouldn&rsquo;t easily trust him. So, Lady Piaomiao prepared a special poison.<br>They would have him consume this poison. That way, they&rsquo;d have shackles over both his and Ya Fei&rsquo;s life. This ensured he wouldn&rsquo;t dare play any tricks on them.<br>If everything went successfully, they would send the army to the Misty Peak.<br>Of course, since the Immortal Execution Archipelago was so powerful, even the entire Crippling Night Demon Sect was no match for it. Thus, they wouldn&rsquo;t have a head-on confrontation. They would only use various methods to throw the Immortal Execution Archipelago into chaos, opening an opportunity for Chu Feng to find the Immortal Transference Mysterious Technique.<br>This method was very simple&mdash;there was a formation no one knew of deep within the Misty Peak&rsquo;s sea. Lady Piaomiao had constructed that formation over several hundred years with the Misty Peak&rsquo;s resources.<br>Originally, that formation was used for guarding the Misty Peak. However, since it was incomplete, a single person could not activate it&mdash;there was a minimum requirement of several tens of thousands of people, even millions of people. The more people there were, the stronger the power. This formation would definitely catch Murong Mingtian and the others off guard, thus creating havoc.<br>At that time, Chu Feng could follow the First Immortal and go forth to the stone tablet and cultivate the Immortal Transference Mysterious Technique. Then, he would be able to refine the Pearl of Immortal Inheritance and receive Lady Piaomiao&rsquo;s cultivation&mdash;rank four Martial King.<br>Although it was only rank four Martial King, it depended on who possessed such cultivation. If Chu Feng were a rank four Martial King, his fighting strength would absolutely be much more terrifying than the former Lady Piaomiao, a rank six Martial King. In addition to the power of the Demon Sealing Sword, Jiang Qisha might not even be able to defeat Chu Feng if he wielded the power of the Demon Sealing Sword.<br>Every single thing was done for Chu Feng. The outcome of this depended solely on him.<br>If Chu Feng succeeded, then they could remove a great enemy and take back everything. If Chu Feng failed, then the entire Crippling Night Demon Sect who participated in this would die along with him.<br>As Lady Piaomiao said before: this was a gamble. A &ldquo;make or break&rdquo; gamble, one where failure was not an option.<br>&ldquo;The greater the power, the greater the responsibility. Chu Feng, this&rsquo;ll depend on you alone.&rdquo; Lady Piaomiao spread open her palm, and gave Chu Feng the Pearl of Immortal Inheritance which contained her cultivation attainments over several hundred years.<br>&ldquo;Senior, don&rsquo;t worry. Although I do not dare to guarantee this will succeed, I will do everything within my abilities,&rdquo; Chu Feng swore after receiving the Pearl of Immortal Inheritance.<br>Chu Feng and the others directly departed afterwards. As for Lady Piaomiao, she remained here.<br>She stood atop a peak, and watched the four people who disappeared instantly in the horizon. Her expression started changing when she couldn&rsquo;t see them anymore. Its initial calmness existed no longer. Replacing it were endless worry and uneasiness.<br>No one was certain of this battle&rsquo;s outcome. No one knew who would live and who would die. However, she knew if Taikou and Qiushui Fuyan were to die, she would not live on.<br>It was dead silent on their journey&hellip;<br>After they all reached the Eastern Sea Region, they went their own ways.<br>Chu Feng and Qiu Canfeng hurried to the Depraved Ravine. Everything went according to their expectations, but when they arrived, they couldn&rsquo;t help being shocked.<br>They discovered with astonishment that the Spirit Formation which sealed the Depraved Ravine had been deactivated. Outside the Depraved Ravine was a large number of people. There were at least several millions, perhaps near ten million.<br>Moreover, there was some similarity between them&mdash;they wore the same clothing. They also had outstanding cultivation; these were the members of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. They had gathered together.<br>Although this was not the formation back at the Crippling Night Demon Sect&rsquo;s peak era&mdash;it was even less than half of back then&mdash;after being interspersed about the Eastern Sea Region for so many years, it was really not easy to have gathered so many members.<br>&ldquo;It seems that the news of the invaded Misty Peak has been known. Those three old things are impatient now. That&rsquo;s probably why they showed up at the same time and summoned all of them.&rdquo;<br>Qiu Canfeng faintly smiled. With his and Chu Feng&rsquo;s hearing strength, there was no need to ask anyone as they eavesdropped a few things from the ocean of people underneath.<br>The news had been spread: the Immortal Execution Archipelago allying with the Three Great Monstrous Clans and seizing the Misty Peak, and the unknown conditions of Lady Piaomiao, Qiushui Fuyan, Chu Feng, and the others.<br>The Crippling Night Demon Sect, as the Immortal Execution Archipelago&rsquo;s archenemy, were aware of this peril.<br>The reason so many members appeared in the Depraved Ravine was due to the summon from You Mingdeng, Xue Xiyue, and Fu Liansheng.<br>As for the goal of summoning the Crippling Night Demon Sect&rsquo;s army, it was to choose a new sect head!<br></p></div>
