        <div>: Crisis in the Zhuge Clan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While the elder of the Zhuge Clan was carefully assessing the situation, amongst the blue-robed figures, a woman holding onto a white cat in her embrace suddenly raised her head. Her eyes seemed to be directed toward the three elders of the Zhuge Clan in the sky.<br>&ldquo;Oh? Are they from the Zhuge Clan?&rdquo;<br>The woman had a beautiful appearance, but her smile was devilish.<br>&ldquo;This is bad. Inform Lord Clan Chief!&rdquo;<br>The gray-haired elder immediately turned around to leave the area.<br>&ldquo;Thinking of getting away?&rdquo; the woman sneered.<br>The next moment, her black eyes suddenly turned grayish-white.<br>Gwah!<br>The three elders of the Zhuge Clan turned into stone statues that plummeted from the sky. Following that, the blue-robed figures swiftly advanced to the Zhuge Clan.<br>&hellip;<br>After Chu Feng and the others entered the ancient teleportation formation, they headed for the closest starfield.<br>&ldquo;Are you willing to talk now?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei asked.<br>&ldquo;To be honest with you, I have been coveting an item of the Zhuge Clan for a very long time, but I have refrained from making a move due to my personal ties with the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Nevertheless, in my many visits to the Zhuge Clan, I secretly constructed a teleportation formation that allows us to bypass the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s defensive barrier and infiltrate their midst,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said.<br>&ldquo;Master Yin Ren, is that for real? Does the teleportation formation really works?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never tried it before, but I can swear on its effectiveness. It&rsquo;s just that it can only be used once. You should have noticed that the Zhuge Clan has sent its people to keep an eye on us, so we have to feign our departure.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s head to the closest Treasure Ordinary Realm right now. It&rsquo;s located in proximity to the Zhuge Clan, but it&rsquo;s a realm filled with world spiritists. We should be able to get there without incurring the suspicion of the Zhuge Clan.<br>&ldquo;From the Treasure Ordinary Realm, we&rsquo;ll use the teleportation formation to return to the Zhuge Clan,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said.<br>&ldquo;Even if we&rsquo;re able to infiltrate the Zhuge Clan, won&rsquo;t they notice us right away? The defensive barrier should have detection capabilities, no?&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu posed his doubt.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken that into consideration as well. Naturally, I have my means to avoid their detection, or else I wouldn&rsquo;t have wasted my effort constructing this formation at all,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said confidently.<br>The group began operating based on Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s plan. After they arrived at Treasure Ordinary Realm, they began making their way back to the realm where the Zhuge Clan was located.<br>It was just that they chose to take another ancient teleportation formation that was slightly further away from the Zhuge Clan this time around. Also, they used a formation to conceal themselves from detection.<br>Under Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s lead, they arrived at a flatland, where they started traveling underground. At the depths of the earth, they stumbled upon a spirit formation gate.<br>This spirit formation gate was hidden at an obscure location. If not for Master Yin Ren leading the way, they would have never been able to find it.<br>Chu Feng and the others subconsciously glanced at Master Yin Ren.<br>They were still harboring some doubts when Master Yin Ren mentioned the existence of a teleportation formation leading directly into the Zhuge Clan, but their suspicions had been mostly dissipated by this point. They could tell that the teleportation formation was extraordinary.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t just made out of spirit power. It was built using rare materials that harnessed the power of teleportation. This was the first time Chu Feng had seen such materials.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, place this on your body.&rdquo;<br>Master Yin Ren took out a few old and tattered cloaks and distributed them to the group. Despite its shabby appearance, Chu Feng could sense that the amazing power hidden within the cloak as soon as it reached his hand.<br>&ldquo;This cloak can only be used once, but it boasts great effectiveness. Pay attention. This is the hand seal required to activate the cloak.&rdquo;<br>Master Yin Ren began slowly forming a few hand seals, but the moment he murmured the words &lsquo;Activate&rsquo;, he disappeared on the spot. It was impossible to sense his aura at all; it was as if he had vanished from the face of the world.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare escape!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei suddenly released an oppressive might to seal off the area. He was afraid that Master Yin Ren would exploit this opportunity to get away.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Master Yin Ren burst into laughter.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, calm down. These cloaks are linked to each other. You&rsquo;ll be able to find me if you activate the cloak using the same hand seals I demonstrated earlier,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said.<br>Chu Feng and the others quickly activated the cloaks too. As soon as the formation was activated, they could sense themselves being enveloped in a powerful concealment formation.<br>The vanished Master Yin Ren did reappear before their eyes, just that his figure looked a little illusory. It was the same for Shengguang Baimei and the others too. This was the effect of the cloaks.<br>Master Yin Ren took out a uniquely designed spirit formation key and fused it into the spirit formation gate, though the fusion process seemed to require some time.<br>&ldquo;Elder, did you notice anything peculiar about the Ancient Era Realm Soulstone?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Daoist Niantian via voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;The effects are similar to what Master Yin Ren mentioned. I didn&rsquo;t notice anything else about it. Chu Feng, you don&rsquo;t trust Master Yin Ren because you noticed that he&rsquo;s hiding something?&rdquo; Daoist Niantian replied.<br>Even though Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t made things difficult for Master Yin Ren, he had never once lowered his guard toward the latter.<br>&ldquo;I only distrusted him at the start, but I didn&rsquo;t expect him to possess such great means. He&rsquo;s only staying with us because he chooses to; we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to stop him if he really tries to escape. I&rsquo;m not sure if he&rsquo;s really trying to help us here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve long heard of Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s abilities, but it looks like he&rsquo;s even more formidable than I thought. We should indeed keep our guard up against him,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian replied.<br>After all, Master Yin Ren had been keeping secrets from them. For one, it was only after the Zhuge Clan had pulled one over them that he mentioned that he had a teleportation formation leading into the Zhuge Clan.<br>Even though Master Yin Ren appeared to be helping Chu Feng now, the truth was that none of them knew for certain what the nature of the teleportation formation before them was.<br>All in all, they were unable to grasp the full extent of Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s abilities and his intention, and that was what made Chu Feng uneasy.<br>He didn&rsquo;t think that that it was a good thing for them to be so dependent on Master Yin Ren, but there was no other choice now. Master Yin Ren was the only one who had the keys to what they needed.<br>Weng!<br>Faint light lit up in the underground cavern as Master Yin Ren finally fused the key into the spirit formation gate. The spirit formation gate began undergoing some changes.<br>The crowd knew that the spirit formation gate was in a closed state earlier, and it was finally opening up now.<br>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said before entering the spirit formation gate.<br>Chu Feng and the others quickly followed him.<br>Just as Master Yin Ren had said, the teleportation formation did lead to the Zhuge Clan. In fact, they could see several members of the Zhuge Clan in their vicinity as soon as they stepped out of the teleportation formation.<br>Those people didn&rsquo;t seem to notice them or the spirit formation gate at all, which showed that Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s concealment means were effective.<br>This put Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart at ease.<br>However, they soon noticed that something was amiss. The atmosphere was peculiar.<br>Some of the members of the Zhuge Clan were lying on the ground injured. The others had gotten into a neat formation under their elders&rsquo; directives. It looked as if they were preparing for war!<br></p></div>
