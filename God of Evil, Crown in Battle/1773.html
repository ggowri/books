        <h1>Chapter 1772</h1>
        <div> - Entering<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;You said that you&rsquo;re planning to bring the three of us in?&rdquo; Big Radish and Little Radish asked simultaneously.<br>It was not that they did not clearly hear what Chu Feng was saying. Rather, they did not dare to believe their ears.<br>Although they did not know what was inside that gate, they could very well imagine that it was filled with layer upon layer of dangers.<br>With the strength that Chu Feng and Yan Xie possessed, it would naturally not be difficult for them to pass through those difficulties.<br>However, if they were to bring three burdens like Chili Pepper and the others with them, they would definitely be creating more troubles for themselves.<br>After all, passing through the difficult trials within the gate would only be a part of the difficulty. Most importantly, it was a race against time.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded. Although Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t say much, the confidence he displayed in his eyes made it so that Chili Pepper and the others could not find reason to not believe in him.<br>&ldquo;However, if we are truly able to reach the inside, we will be included among the twenty individuals. But we simply do not have the strength to compete against those geniuses,&rdquo; Big Radish was still worried.<br>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fine if we are to choose to give up on fighting after we enter? I refuse to believe that if we refuse to fight, they will place their blades on our necks and force us to fight,&rdquo; Chili Pepper said.<br>&ldquo;What Chili Pepper said is reasonable. There is no set rule in this place that said that one cannot bring one&rsquo;s friends in to watch the show. Thus, I am naturally capable of bringing you all in with me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;If we are truly able to enter, it would truly be great,&rdquo; Hearing those words, Big Radish and Little Radish both revealed smiles of incomparable joy and expressions of excitement.<br>If they were really able to enter, they would have successfully accomplished one of their cherished desires.<br>After this matter was decided, Chu Feng and the others walked out of the world spirit building. Regardless of where they went, they were the focus of the crowd.<br>In fact, when Chu Feng walked toward the entrance, the surrounding crowd began to make way for him. Furthermore, they were also nodding at Chu Feng with smiles on their faces.<br>Due to the fact that the Four Great Imperial Clans were determined to kill Chu Feng, even though many people greatly admired Chu Feng and wished to befriend him, they did not dare to be too close to Chu Feng. However, at the same time, they also did not dare to offend him.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~~&rdquo;<br>Finally, the countdown timer on the entrance stopped. However, the entrance did not open immediately. Instead, an illusory silhouette appeared before it.<br>It was a middle-aged man. This middle-aged man was as enormous as that entrance gate. As he stood there, he looked like an enormous mountain. It was a very shocking sight.<br>Although it was only an image, the aura this middle-aged man emitted caused the crowd to become nervous. They began to feel reverence for that middle-aged man from the bottom of their hearts.<br>That was because that middle-aged man was a Martial Emperor. Furthermore, he was no ordinary Martial Emperor. Instead, he was a Martial Emperor of a higher rank than the Four Great Imperial Clans&rsquo; Clan Chiefs. Else, it would be impossible for him to possess this sort of air.<br>When this image of that middle-aged man appeared, the crowd were all able to sense how powerful this man was. Furthermore, many people did not recognize him.<br>It was like he was an expert that had never appeared in the Holy Land of Martialism before.<br>Thus, the first reaction that the crowd had was wondering whether or not this man was the creator of this fort, the person standing behind that Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor?<br>&ldquo;Everyone, this gate is about to open. I believe that, without me telling all of you, you all can guess how dangerous the other side of this gate is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I wish to remind everyone here that of all the people who enter the fort, only twenty individuals will be able to fight against Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor. Those twenty individuals will be the first twenty people that reach the designated place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After those twenty people have entered, the rest of the people will not be able to enter anymore and must return.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, everyone, please consider your own strength. If you do not think that you will be able to become one of the twenty individuals, I advise you that it would be better for you to not set foot into the gate behind me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because even if you all are able to pass through all of the hurdles, you will still not be able to enter the central region. Furthermore, if you are to encounter hurdles that you cannot overcome, you&rsquo;ll end up losing your life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lastly, the hurdles of this place will surpass your imagination. If anyone wishes to bring other people to overcome the hurdles, you must consider your own strength even more. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll only harm others and yourself,&rdquo; After leaving those words, the middle-aged man smiled a profound smile. In fact, he even deliberately took a glance at Chu Feng. Then, his image began to rapidly disappear.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~~&rdquo;<br>At the same time, the entrance gate that had been shut for a long time began to slowly open while making loud rumbling sounds.<br>Although the entrance had been opened, no one entered. Instead, everyone turned their gazes onto Chu Feng and Yan Xie.<br>Evidently, after they heard what that middle-aged man had said, they gave up on trying to enter that place. However, they knew that Chu Feng and Yan Xie would definitely not give up.<br>Suddenly, Big Radish said, &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ve thought about it. I think that it&rsquo;s better for Little Radish and me to stay. You can just take Chili Pepper with you,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll also be staying,&rdquo; Chili Pepper also said.<br>Although they were saying those words, Chu Feng was able to tell from their gazes that they deeply regretted not being able to enter.<br>How could Chu Feng not know that they actually wanted to enter the deepest region of the fort together with him? Merely, after hearing that mysterious middle-aged man&rsquo;s words, they didn&rsquo;t wish to become Chu Feng&rsquo;s burden.<br>Thus, Chu Feng smiled and asked, &ldquo;Do you all not trust me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No&hellip; it&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; Chili Pepper and the others didn&rsquo;t know how to respond.<br>&ldquo;Enough with the justs and buts, just follow me,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he waved his sleeve. A layer of world spirit power sprinkled down like golden sand. After his world spirit power landed on them, it turned into three defensive barriers that covered Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish.<br>These three defensive barriers were extremely close To Chu Feng. Wherever Chu Feng went, they would follow him.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Before Chili Pepper and the others could react, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body had turned into a ray of light and charged into that open entrance gate, &ldquo;Brother Yan Xie, you must catch up.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although you&rsquo;re a rank seven Half Martial Emperor, you&rsquo;re bringing three people with you. I will not necessarily lose to you.&rdquo;<br>Yan Xie smiled slightly. Then, he took a step forward and turned into a ray of light that followed Chu Feng into the open entrance.<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng actually refused to listen to that expert&rsquo;s warning and brought three people in with him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those three people all possess cultivations below Half Martial Emperor. They are most definitely burdens. For Chu Feng to bring them, isn&rsquo;t he just creating trouble for himself?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had entered while bringing Chili Pepper and the others with him, many people sucked in a mouthful of cold air and revealed expressions of shock.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is very powerful. Even if he is to bring three people with him, no one will be faster than him,&rdquo; However, there were also people that were extremely confident in Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Humph, that child is too arrogant and conceited,&rdquo; However, at this moment, that Heavenly Law Palace&rsquo;s leading elder mocked and ridiculed.<br>&ldquo;Did that Chu Feng really think that he was unparalleled under heaven just because he&rsquo;s a rank seven Half Martial Emperor?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he know that there are countless experts among the younger generation who have come here? Many among them are capable of contending against him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Especially our Heavenly Law Palace&rsquo;s three Heavenly Generals. Each and every one of them are not inferior to that Chu Feng. Not to mention the strongest Heavenly General, even the second and third strongest Heavenly Generals will become Chu Feng&rsquo;s nightmare.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so arrogant and conceited that he considers everyone to be beneath him. Sooner or later, he will suffer the consequences of his actions,&rdquo; When that Heavenly Law Palace&rsquo;s elder spoke those words, he had an expression of feeling at ease. It was as if he were finally able to release a fart that he hadn&rsquo;t dared to release before.<br>Evidently, he had been holding those words in his heart for a very long time now.<br></p></div>
