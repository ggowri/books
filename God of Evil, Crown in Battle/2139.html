        <div> - A Request<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Why do you want me to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect? Could it be that there are grudges between you and the Infant Soul Sect, father?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Chu Feng was surprised. He did not expect that his father would want him to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect after warning him about how dangerous it was.<br>However, he felt that his father most definitely possessed a reason to give him such a task. He felt that the most likely reason would be that the Infant Soul Sect was his father&rsquo;s enemy.<br>&ldquo;There are no grudges between the Infant Soul Sect and me. Merely, the Infant Soul Sect is an evil power. Do you know why they are called the Infant Soul Sect?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because everyone in the Infant Soul Sect uses the souls of newly born infants as cultivation resources. The longer the Infant Soul Sect continues to exist, the more innocent infants will die by their hands. Thus, the Infant Soul Sect should be eliminated,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;They truly deserve to die,&rdquo; Chu Feng detested those that bullied the old, weak, sick or disabled the most. Furthermore&hellip; the Infant Soul Sect was a power composed of people that harmed innocent infants.<br>Thinking about it, lives that have just been born to this world, before they could experience the wonders of this world, before they could even get to know this world, ended up being killed by those fiends. Oh how cruel the people from the Infant Soul Sect must be.<br>&ldquo;While the Infant Soul Sect should be eliminated, there are a lot of powers that use those sorts of malicious techniques to cultivate. It is extremely difficult to eliminate all of them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, to help the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm eliminate evil is merely one of the reasons why I want you to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect. Apart from that, there&rsquo;s another reason that&rsquo;s the most important,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Father, please continue,&rdquo; Chu Feng said earnestly.<br>&ldquo;In order to nurture outstanding members of the younger generation, the Chu Heavenly Clan has also used some extreme measures. That is, they will have their younger generation accept and complete missions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As far as I know, there are many missions in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, even though the Chu Heavenly Clan exists in the Upper Realm, there are also people from the Chu Heavenly Clan in the Ordinary Realms. Furthermore, they are mostly members of the younger generation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, there is a rule in the Chu Heavenly Clan. As long as the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation are daring enough to enter the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm and carry out missions there, they will no longer be protected by the Chu Heavenly Clan. Even if they should encounter fatal dangers, the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan will not interfere.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In other words, when in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, the life and death of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation will only be their own problem.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With all that said, one of the highest level missions, one that is the most difficult, is to eliminate the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm&rsquo;s Infant Soul Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, so far, none of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation have been able to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect. On the contrary, many of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elites from the younger generation were killed by the Infant Soul Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As time passed, the Infant Soul Sect no longer feared the Chu Heavenly Clan. After all&hellip; they remained safe even after killing so many of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s geniuses,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;It is the Chu Heavenly Clan that has deliberately ignored the Infant Soul Sect? They have done so&hellip; all for the sake of nurturing their younger generation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. The Infant Soul Sect could be said to be a power that has done all sorts of evil in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. However, if the Chu Heavenly Clan wishes to eliminate them, it would be an effortless task for them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason they have not eliminated the Infant Soul Sect and instead tasked their younger generation with eliminating the Infant Soul Sect repeatedly, is precisely because they hoped that there would be a younger generation from the Chu Heavenly Clan that could eliminate the Infant Soul Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ever since the mission to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect appeared, there has not been a single member of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation capable of completing that mission,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Father, I understand your intention,&rdquo; Chu Feng said. He truly understood.<br>Eliminating the Infant Soul Sect was a mission that none of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation was capable of accomplishing.<br>If Chu Feng was able to accomplish it, it would mean that he would&rsquo;ve given the Chu Heavenly Clan a ruthless slap to the face. After all, he was deemed to be trash that did not possess the Heavenly Bloodline of the Chu Heavenly Clan; he was someone that had been stripped of his status as a part of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;There is an age requirement for eliminating the Infant Soul Sect. Members of the Chu Clan older than forty are not allowed to accept that mission. Feng&rsquo;er, your age is still well within the requirement. After all, you are not even thirty years old.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you do not have to accept that mission from the Chu Heavenly Clan. It would do if you were to just eliminate the Infant Soul Sect directly. After all, you are nominally no longer a part of the Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, to the Chu Heavenly Clan, regardless of who it is that did it, it would be a disgrace for the Chu Heavenly Clan as long as it is a member of the younger generation younger than forty years old that eliminates the Infant Soul Sect,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>Sure enough, what he had in mind was exactly what Chu Feng was thinking. He planned to humiliate the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Although he did not plan to kill people from the Chu Heavenly Clan, Chu Xuanyuan wanted the Chu Heavenly Clan to know that their decision back then was a mistake.<br>&ldquo;That said, Feng&rsquo;er, I have a matter that I must warn you about. While I sent someone to secretly protect you in this place, once you enter the Outer World, I will absolutely not act to help you. You must rely on yourself for everything,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan warned Chu Feng in a very serious manner.<br>&ldquo;I understand. I will absolutely not do anything reckless. Although the actions of the Infant Soul Sect are truly infuriating to the heart, I will definitely not make them an enemy before I possess sufficient strength to take them on,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Mn, in that case, go on ahead to the Outer World. I have already taken Zi Ling as my disciple. When it is time, I will have her assist you in the Outer World,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Father, you&rsquo;ve truly taken Zi Ling as your disciple?&rdquo; Chu Feng was overjoyed.<br>Chu Feng did not know how powerful his father was. However, he was able to guess that his father must be extremely powerful.<br>If Zi Ling truly became his father&rsquo;s disciple, Zi Ling&rsquo;s strength would definitely advance by leaps and bounds. To both Chu Feng and Zi Ling, that would be something good.<br>&ldquo;Why would I lie to you about something like that? Zi Ling&rsquo;s foundations are pretty decent. If she is properly nurtured, she will be able to attain accomplishments even in the Outer World.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Feng&rsquo;er, there are actually a lot of people who possess decent foundations. However, if they are unable to expand upon them themselves, it would all be useless. The reason for that is because there is no one in this world with the time to assist others to expand their foundations. Zi Ling belonged to the sort that needed another&rsquo;s assistance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I think that you should be able to understand why I am helping her,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng naturally understood that Chu Xuanyuan was spending that much effort to help Zi Ling because of him. After all, Zi Ling was his lover.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good that you know. Zi Ling&rsquo;s potential needed me to develop it. However you&hellip; you must develop your potential yourself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, I am able to wholly nurture you and let you leave after you are capable of contending against others.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I fear that while you might be able to become very powerful in a short period of time under my umbrella, your future prospects will instead be limited. If that is the case, the gains will not make up for the losses.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, one must look at the long-term. Thus, I hope that you are able to understand my intentions,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Father, please rest assured. I will definitely go and comprehend the path of martial cultivation diligently,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Mn, I know that my Feng&rsquo;er is a person with perseverance. That part of you resembles both me and your grandfather,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Hehe&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed proudly. He felt those words to be the greatest praise.<br>After all, both his grandfather and his father were grand existences with renowned reputations in the Outer World.<br>&ldquo;Father, you said that you will no longer help me once I reach the Outer World. I am still not yet in the Outer World now, are you able to still help me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Feng&rsquo;er, if you want more cultivation resources, you do not have to bother asking,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said decisively. His tone was very cold and grim. It seemed that he was determined to not help Chu Feng increase his cultivation.<br>&ldquo;Father, please rest assured. I will only rely on myself for my cultivation. I will not ask you for assistance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What I wanted father&rsquo;s assistance with is something else,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What is it? Go ahead and tell me,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said after finding out that it was not related to Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation.<br><br></p></div>
