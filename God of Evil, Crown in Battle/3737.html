        <div> - An Unprecedented Grand Occasion<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Ah? It&rsquo;s actually that weak?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt completely shaken up upon hearing those words.<br>Actually, Chu Feng was not interested in the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>The place that he wanted to go to the most was the Seven Realms Galaxy.<br>Located in that place was the power that his mother belonged to, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.<br>The reason why Chu Feng wanted to go to the Seven Realms Galaxy was because he wanted to save his mother.<br>However, his father had once told him that the Seven Realms Galaxy was stronger than the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>If Chu Feng wanted to proceed for the Seven Realms Galaxy, he must at least make a name for himself in the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>At the very least, his cultivation could not be too weak. Otherwise, even if he managed to reach the Seven Realms Galaxy, he would not be able to accomplish anything.<br>Over the years, Chu Feng had been trying his hardest to train. Compared to ordinary people, his cultivation had increased rapidly.<br>However, although he had managed to become a peak level existence among the people of the younger generation, Chu Feng was still extremely weak in terms of being placed among the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>And now, to his surprise, he learned that the Ancestral Martial Starfield was actually such a small and weak starfield in the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>This made Chu Feng once again realize the massive disparity in strength.<br>When he was unable to establish a footing for himself in such a weak Ancestral Martial Starfield, how exactly was he supposed to proceed to the Seven Realms Galaxy to take on their ruler?<br>At that moment, the name &lsquo;Seven Realms Galaxy&rsquo; was like an enormous mountain ruthlessly crushing down on Chu Feng, stifling him.<br>&ldquo;Do you now know how honored you are to be able to become this old man&rsquo;s disciple?&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this junior will accomplish the mission senior gave me. That said, does this junior need to come and find you after I have completed the mission?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to attempt to find me. You will not be able to find me anyways. You merely need to wait for me to find you,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;In that case, this junior understands.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, if there&rsquo;s nothing else that you need from me, this junior shall take his leave.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng put away the map and clasped his fist respectfully towards the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>He was in a hurry to leave because it was about time for him to return to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>If he didn&rsquo;t leave, even if Grandmaster Liangqiu were to lead the way, he would not be able to return on time.<br>&ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo; The Ox-nosed Old Daoist waved his hand.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng bowed to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist again. Then, he started flying towards the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Teleportation Formation.<br>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after Chu Feng began flying, before he could even fly far away, a ray of light rapidly flew toward him from behind.<br>It was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. He had tossed something toward Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng extended his hand to catch the item. Upon catching the item&hellip; he discovered that it was a wooden stick.<br>That said, it was no ordinary wooden stick.<br>The wooden stick was two feet long and covered in runes and symbols.<br>Holding the wooden stick in his hand, Chu Feng was able to sense how amazing of an item it was.<br>That wooden stick actually contained a spirit formation. It was an extremely powerful spirit formation.<br>How powerful was that spirit formation???<br>One would have to talk about how worried Chu Feng was.<br>Chu Feng would not only confront Linghu Hongfei upon his return to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. His greatest problem was actually the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>The Linghu Heavenly Clan was able to defeat the Wuming Clan. From this, it was obvious how powerful they were.<br>However, after Chu Feng sensed the power of the spirit formation within that wooden stick, the worry in his heart immediately decreased a lot.<br>This was why the wooden stick was so powerful. It served as a safety guarantee for Chu Feng. With that, he felt much more relieved.<br>With a smile on his face, Chu Feng said to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, &ldquo;Senior, it would appear that you do not have confidence in me either.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist must&rsquo;ve specifically prepared such a powerful spirit formation for him.<br>In the end, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was still worried for him.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with all these superfluous words? If you don&rsquo;t want it, you can very well return it to this old man,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said from afar. He even extended his hand to indicate for Chu Feng to return the wooden stick.<br>&ldquo;I want it, I never said that I didn&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve given it to me, it&rsquo;s mine now,&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly put away the wooden stick. Then, he immediately left.<br>He was afraid that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist would have a change of mind, and decide to retrieve that precious treasure of a wooden stick...<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Ancestral Martial Starfield. Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,<br>This was originally a very ordinary and even somewhat lousy Upper Realm in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Normally, apart from the powers of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, very few powers would travel to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>However, it was different at this moment.<br>The Tantai Heavenly Clan, Jiaoli Heavenly Clan, Moyi Heavenly Clan, Shangfang Heavenly Clan, Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan, Wuma Heavenly Clan, Puyang Heavenly Clan, Tang Heavenly Clan, Li Heavenly Clan...<br>Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, Nightmare Spirit Clan, Heaven Reaching Beast Clan...<br>All those huge monsters whose names could shake up the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield were all gathered in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>Those top powers were not the only ones gathered in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>Apart from them, there were also countless other powers that had arrived in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm in succession.<br>It could be said that all of the powers of the Ancestral Martial Starfield had dispatched people to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>Apart from those powers that came from all over, there were also peak experts from all over the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Even Exalted Heavenly Fate, the Saintly Stellar Monk, White Dragon Demon Daoist, Queen Mother Fox Immortal&hellip; those experts withdrawn from worldly matters, experts that one could not find even if one sought them, were all present in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>Not only had all those people arrived in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, but they were all gathered outside the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>It could be said that all the grand characters of the Ancestral Martial Starfield were gathered outside the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>There was a vast sea of people and hundreds of millions of silhouettes visible. They were all martial cultivators with powerful backgrounds.<br>Faced with such an impressive display, the local major powers of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were simply unable to approach them.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that they didn&rsquo;t want to approach those people. It was instead that they were unqualified to approach them, and did not dare to approach them.<br>The people from the Starfall Holy Temple, the Ghost Sect Hall, the Paradise Valley and other powers could only stand in the distant sky and watch from afar.<br>No matter how powerful they were in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they could not contend against those true major powers.<br>At that moment, an unprecedentedly grand occasion was happening in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>Even during Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s eras, such a disposition of forces had not appeared in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>The reason why so many major powers were all gathered in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was naturally because of Chu Feng.<br>They had all come for the three month appointment between Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei.<br>The marvelous battle between Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm was still vivid in the crowd&rsquo;s minds.<br>However, things were vastly different from before.<br>Back then, the Linghu Heavenly Clan would have to show respect to the people of the Starfield Master Realm.<br>However, everyone already knew that the Starfield Master Realm had been defeated by the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>The current Linghu Heavenly Clan had replaced the Starfield Master Realm, and had become the fully-deserving overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Thus, Chu Feng&rsquo;s opponent was not merely Linghu Hongfei.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s opponent was the future ruler of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>After all, everyone knew that Linghu Hongfei would, sooner or later, be the person to succeed the throne as the next clan chief of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br></p></div>
