        <div> - Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s Business Transaction<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior, this junior has tried so hard to find you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that I&rsquo;d end up meeting you here.&rdquo;<br>After verifying that that person was indeed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Chu Feng became even more excited.<br>After all, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was the person capable of turning the Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, White Tiger and Azure Dragon, the four Sacred Beasts, back into Divine Power.<br>The Vermilion Bird Resurrection Technique, Black Tortoise Armor Technique, White Tiger Slaughtering Technique and Azure Dragon Dashing Technique were extremely powerful secret skills obtained by Chu Feng in his youth.<br>Even though the Four Great Secret Skills were no longer effective after his cultivation increased, they had provided enormous help to him back then.<br>Thus, to Chu Feng, the four of them were most definitely not simply secret skills.<br>To Chu Feng, the four secret skills were seniors that he possessed deep feelings for.<br>Chu Feng greatly hoped that they would be able to regain their overwhelming power and fight alongside him.<br>&ldquo;Boy, by the way you&rsquo;re reacting, you&rsquo;ve been searching for me the entire time?&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng acting so excited, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist felt rather surprised.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I have indeed been searching for you the entire time. Never would I have expected to find you here,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This old man has been here the entire time. It has been many years now. If you were searching me outside, you would naturally not be able to find me. That said, why are you searching for me?&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.<br>&ldquo;This junior wishes to fuse with the Divine Power within me,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You have a Divine Power in you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Extend your hand, this old man will have a look,&rdquo; As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke, he grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s wrist.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Soon, Chu Feng sensed a power pouring into his soul from his wrist.<br>Chu Feng did not resist the power. Instead, he allowed the power to enter his soul.<br>He knew that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was examining the power within him.<br>&ldquo;Boy, that Divine Power within your body is quite remarkable.&rdquo;<br>After examining him, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist revealed a shocked look in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Senior, are you able to help me?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;The more powerful a Divine Power is, the more difficult it is to fuse with it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for that Divine Power you possess, it is simply the strongest Divine Power this old man has ever seen. Fusing with it will be very difficult.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about you fuse with this Divine Power of mine? It&rsquo;s comparatively easier to fuse with,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said as he raised the bead he held in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Senior, a person can only fuse with a single Divine Power, right?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. This old man helped a Divine Body fuse with another Divine Power before, allowing him to possess two Divine Powers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you already possess the power of a Heavenly Bloodline. Thus, if you want to fuse with a Divine Power, you can only fuse with a single Divine Power,&rdquo; After saying those words, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist patted Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulder. He smiled and said, &ldquo;Boy, don&rsquo;t be too greedy. To be able to possess both Divine Power and a Heavenly Bloodline is something that many people do not dare to imagine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, this junior still wishes to assimilate with the Divine Power within me,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. However, I&rsquo;ve been frank with you. That Divine Power within you is rather difficult to deal with. It will be much harder to fuse with it. This old man is unable to guarantee success either,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, the halberd below is no ordinary halberd. Likely, that&rsquo;s the legendary Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd, no?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked all of a sudden.<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip;? Why are you asking that?&rdquo; asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;The Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd is a thing of legend. Its value is likely superior to fusing a Divine Power, no?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Boy, I&rsquo;ll be frank with you. Indeed, that is the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd. It is also extremely valuable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, not to mention the Ancestral Martial Starfield, even if you are to ask the entire Holy Light Galaxy, you will find that no one apart from this old man is capable of fusing Divine Power into one&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the end, the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd is a weapon. No matter how powerful a weapon might be, there will be a time when it&rsquo;ll be ineffective.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if you are to obtain Divine Power, it will benefit you for the rest of your life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, if we calculate things like that, you would&rsquo;ve made an enormous profit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, you need this old man&rsquo;s help in order to obtain the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd. If this old man doesn&rsquo;t help you, with the bits of strength that you possess, not only will you not be able to obtain the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd, but you will be killed before you even manage to approach it. You wouldn&rsquo;t even know how you died,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist mocked.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please don&rsquo;t be angry. This junior never said that he wouldn't cooperate with you." Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Then what is your intention? Are you thinking that this old man will be taking advantage of you by asking for your help in obtaining the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd, and then helping you fuse with your Divine Power?&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.<br>&ldquo;That is not this junior&rsquo;s intention either. Actually&hellip; this junior merely had a very small request,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Request?&rdquo; Hearing that word, Ox-nosed Old Daoist rolled his eyes a couple times. Then, he asked, &ldquo;Let me hear about it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since senior is able to help me fuse with a Divine Power, senior should be able to help others fuse with Divine Power too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, you were originally planning to give me the Divine Power you&rsquo;re holding right now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, since I already have a Divine Power in me, how about you give that Divine Power to my friend instead?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I got it. You want me to help you fuse with your Divine Power and help someone else fuse with this Divine Power, is that right?&rdquo; asked Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Senior is truly a senior. I cannot conceal anything from you,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a beaming smile.<br>Chu Feng felt that since the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was willing to help him, he should not waste the opportunity.<br>He wanted the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to give that Divine Power to Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;This old man will ask you a question first. Where did you learn that I am able to help you fuse with Divine Power?&rdquo; asked Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Senior, it is my father who told me. My father is also from the Chu Heavenly Clan. He is called Chu Xuanyuan,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Your father is Chu Xuanyuan? Which means&hellip; you&rsquo;re Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had a major change in expression.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, senior. This junior is indeed Chu Feng. I was overly excited earlier and forgot to introduce myself. I hope senior can forgive my lack of manners,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Alas, so you&rsquo;re actually family. Your father and I have an extraordinary relationship. I even met you when you were a baby. Never would I have imagined that would have grown so big in an instant.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since we&rsquo;re family, it&rsquo;s easier to talk. This old man accepts that request of yours,&rdquo; At that moment, the attitude of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist became particularly amiable. He was reacting like he had seen a person of the younger generation from his family.<br>&ldquo;Senior, in that case, what should this junior do?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You wait here. This old man will draw those guardian spirits away.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After I lead them away, you are to retrieve the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;That simple?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that simple. What&rsquo;s wrong? Are you thinking that you&rsquo;ve made an enormous profit?&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked with a beaming smile.<br>However, seeing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s ugly appearance and vulgar smile, Chu Feng kept having a feeling that things were not as simple as he had said they would be.<br></p></div>
