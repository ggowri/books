        <h1>Chapter 5346</h1>
        <div>: Utter Loss<br>&ldquo;Second Sister, you shouldn&rsquo;t blame our father for doing what he did. I know that you were the one who invited Master Liu here, but Master Liu did go too far this time around. He exploited our desperation in order to make a killing. Besides, I don&rsquo;t think that Master Liu has the ability to win the bet. He doesn&rsquo;t even dare to compete with me, so how could he possibly be a match for Bai Yue?&rdquo;<br>In comparison, Zhou Zhi had no more complaints after learning about Chu Feng&rsquo;s identity.<br>&ldquo;Younger brother, you&rsquo;re misunderstanding Master Liu. Master Liu&rsquo;s capabilities are definitely above yours. He only declined your challenge because he doesn&rsquo;t want to sour ties with us. Besides, it wouldn&rsquo;t be good for him to tire himself out before the bet. If he represents us, there&rsquo;s a good chance that he&rsquo;ll defeat young master Bai Yue. It&rsquo;s only because of how tiring the matter is that he&rsquo;s asking for more compensation,&rdquo; Zhou Shuang explained.<br>&ldquo;Second Sister, how well do you know Master Liu? Are you certain that he&rsquo;ll be able to win the bet?&rdquo; Zhou Zhi asked.<br>How could Zhou Shuang dare to make that guarantee? Instead, she replied, &ldquo;In any case, I think he&rsquo;s still better than Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Second Sister, I&rsquo;ll pay a visit to our Third Sister.&rdquo;<br>Zhou Zhi didn&rsquo;t want to argue with his Second Sister on this, so he stepped out and headed over to Zhou Yi&rsquo;s war chariot.<br>In Zhou Yi&rsquo;s war chariot were their father, the higher-ups of the Zhou Clan, and the yellow-haired elder. They were toasting to one another, celebrating their upcoming victory while praising Zhou Yi for doing well on this matter. If not for her, they wouldn&rsquo;t have managed to receive the aid of someone as powerful as Chu Feng.<br>Upon arriving on the scene, Zhou Zhi raised his wine cup and thanked his Third Sister for helping him rectify his mistake.<br>Meanwhile, Zhou Shuang also left her war chariot. She didn&rsquo;t head for Zhou Yi&rsquo;s war chariot, where the higher-ups of the Zhou Clan were gathered, but instead the one where Chu Feng was residing. She knocked on his door.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, are you resting?&rdquo; Zhou Shuang called out.<br>&ldquo;Why is that woman here? Is she here to cause you trouble?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. I&rsquo;ll take a look,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied before opening the door.<br>To his surprise, Zhou Shuang showed neither anger nor annoyance despite having grumbled loads about him earlier. Instead, she had an extremely gentle look on her face.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, I forgot to introduce myself earlier. I am Zhou Shuang, Little Yi&rsquo;s second sister. I&rsquo;d like to apologize if my words have offended you in any way earlier. I didn&rsquo;t know what you were capable of, and I was simply too worried about our Zhou Clan.&rdquo;<br>It turned out that Zhou Shuang was here to apologize, but how could Chu Feng fall for her hypocritical attitude after having overheard her conversation with her younger brother?<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m about to throw up. How is there such a shameless person in the world? Tell her to get lost!&rdquo; Eggy scolded.<br>Since Eggy had already expressed her disgust toward Zhou Shuang, there was no reason for Chu Feng to remain civil with the latter. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need your apology. Some words of advice, don&rsquo;t become a two-faced person. You&rsquo;ll only turn others against you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Zhou Shuang was taken aback. &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, I don&rsquo;t understand what you mean.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered. &ldquo;You do have a voice isolation barrier in your war chariot, but it&rsquo;s too weak. Do you finally get it now?&rdquo;<br>After saying his piece, Chu Feng closed his door shut.<br>Zhou Shuang froze on the spot. Her face slowly turned red. She realized that Chu Feng had overheard the conversation she had with Zhou Zhi. She felt so embarrassed that she wanted to dive into a hole and hide.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, my deepest apologies,&rdquo; she murmured in utter embarrassment before rushing back own war chariot.<br>The first thing she did upon returning to her war chariot was to construct another layer of formation around her room, but her spirit power was simply so weak that Chu Feng could peer in without resorting to special means.<br>In other words, Chu Feng was still able to clearly sense what was happening inside her room.<br>&ldquo;That stingy fellow! Does he know nothing about gallantry? How did a person like him become the strongest Martial Exalted level cultivator? He must have gotten to that position relying on his family&rsquo;s backing! But&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Argh, I&rsquo;m so angry! Why does Zhou Yi have such good luck? How did she stumble on someone like that just by camping at the Unageing Peak? I thought that this would be a good opportunity for me to win my father's favor, but it was all ruined by Chu Feng! Damn it! Damn it!!!&rdquo;<br>Zhou Shuang furiously smashed everything inside her war chariot.<br>&ldquo;That shameless woman is finally showing her true form. She is only opposed to you because she doesn&rsquo;t want her younger sister to steal her credit. What ugly jealousy she&rsquo;s directing toward her own blood-related sister. Repulsive!&rdquo; Eggy berated.<br>&ldquo;There are plenty of people like her out there. They always think that it&rsquo;s always someone else&rsquo;s fault whenever something happens, never bothering to reflect on what they may have done wrong. Eggy, don&rsquo;t bother wasting your time on trash like that,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Soon enough, the group arrived at a newly-constructed city, where young master Bai Yue was residing. The city was enveloped in a formidable formation that prevented Chu Feng from peering into its depth.<br>This city was constructed by a mysterious organization that had only arrived at this Upper Realm not too long ago. There was no doubt that this was a powerful organization, but no one knew where they were from.<br>A group of people was waiting at the city&rsquo;s entrance, as if knowing that the Zhou Clan would be arriving today. At the forefront of the group was a young man seated on a chair. He wore a world spiritist cloak highlighting his prowess as a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist.<br>He was none other than young master Bai Yue.<br>He was accompanied by his subordinates, who stood neatly in a formation behind him. His subordinates didn&rsquo;t look too powerful, but there was a white-haired old man who caught Chu Feng&rsquo;s attention.<br>The white-haired old man looked ordinary at first glance, but he possessed unfathomable power.<br>Word appeared to have spread far and wide. Aside from young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s group, there were quite a few onlookers in the area, with most of them belonging to indigenous powers of the Upper Realm. They were excited to see the arrival of the Zhou Clan, particularly since they would have made a wasted trip here if the Zhou Clan were to back out of the bet.<br>&ldquo;I thought that you wouldn&rsquo;t be coming,&rdquo; young master Bai Yue said.<br>The Zhou Can&rsquo;s Clan Chief waved his sleeves and brought out countless world spiritist treasures. &ldquo;These are the stakes we have prepared for the bet. May I know where our Zhou Clan&rsquo;s family heirloom is?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; young master Bai Yue replied.<br>He opened up his palm, and an ancient compass floated out.<br>&ldquo;Come, let me see what kind of helper you have brought here.&rdquo;<br>Young master Bai Yue disdainfully glanced at the Zhou Clan&rsquo;s party, as if he was absolutely confident of victory. His subordinates and the white-haired elder took the same attitude too. None of them thought that the Zhou Clan posed a real threat.<br>However, when Chu Feng stepped out from the war chariot, the white-haired elder&rsquo;s expression stiffened. He intently stared at Chu Feng, assessing him from head to toe.<br>&ldquo;Is that young hero Chu Feng?&rdquo; the white-haired elder asked.<br>Before Chu Feng could answer, the Zhou Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had already replied, &ldquo;It looks like you&rsquo;re well-versed in current affairs. Indeed, this is the winner of the Trial of the Strongest&rsquo;s late Martial Exalted level category, young master Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Ignoring the Zhou Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the white-haired elder turned to Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re acquainted with the Zhou Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Are you afraid now? I&rsquo;ll be honest with you. The person who will be representing our Zhou Clan in the bet against your young master is none other than young master Chu Feng! You&rsquo;re free to back out now if you are afraid,&rdquo; the Zhou Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>The white-haired elder frowned. He was clearly a little wary of Chu Feng.<br>The Zhou Clan was filled with glee. This was exactly the kind of reaction they were expecting to see from the other party. It would be best if young master Bai Yue backed out of this bet and simply returned their family heirloom.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo; Young master Bai Yue suddenly burst into laughter. &ldquo;Interesting! I&rsquo;ve really underestimated the Zhou Clan. I didn&rsquo;t think that you would be able to bring the strongest Martial Exalted level cultivator here!&rdquo;<br>Young master Bai Yue turned to Chu Feng before continuing on, &ldquo;But Chu Feng, didn&rsquo;t they tell you the rules? We&rsquo;re competing not on martial power but spirit power here.&rdquo;<br>Unlike the white-haired elder, he only became more excited after learning about Chu Feng&rsquo;s identity. He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t bother wasting time on words here. He released his own spirit power along with the prowess of his world spiritist bloodline. This allowed the crowd to confirm that he was a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, and an extremely powerful one at that.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something amiss about his fighting prowess!&rdquo;<br>The crowd was taken aback. It was common knowledge that a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist&rsquo;s fighting prowess would be comparable to a rank one Half-God level cultivator, but Chu Feng&rsquo;s fighting prowess was on par with rank two Half-God level cultivators.<br>&ldquo;You can admit defeat if you don&rsquo;t want to continue with the bet,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;What a joke. What do I have to fear?&rdquo; young master Bai Yue sneered.<br>He tossed out two talismans that transformed into two identical formations in mid-air.<br>&ldquo;The rules are simple. Each of us will work on each of these identical formations, and the one to decipher it first will be the victor,&rdquo; young master Bai Yue said.<br>&ldquo;When do we begin?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Right now.&rdquo;<br>Young master Bai Yue immediately began constructing a formation with his spirit power. Despite the look of disdain on his face, he dared not to underestimate Chu Feng after the latter flaunted his spirit power.<br>&ldquo;What powerful means! It&rsquo;s no wonder why Zhi&rsquo;er lost to him,&rdquo; the Zhou Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief murmured in unease.<br>Being a Gray Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist himself, he could tell that young master Bai Yue was indeed highly proficient in world spiritist techniques. He was no longer certain if Chu Feng could defeat the latter.<br>In the first place, Chu Feng had made his name as a cultivator, not a world spiritist. There was no doubt that Chu Feng possessed outstanding spirit power for a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, but that didn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that he was good at deciphering formations.<br>&ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t young master Chu Feng constructing his formation?&rdquo;<br>The crowd soon realized that Chu Feng was staring motionlessly at the formation he was supposed to decipher, not doing anything even though the match had already begun.<br>Those from the Zhou Clan clenched their fists nervously, especially when they saw young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s formation swiftly approaching completion. The Zhou Clan had brought out all of its assets for this bet. If they lost this gamble, their clan would surely fall through the ranks.<br>&ldquo;I already told you that Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make it, but you refused to listen. Look at where it landed us. Our Zhou Clan&rsquo;s future is going to be ruined in his hands,&rdquo; Zhou Shuang sent a voice transmission to the Zhou Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Zhou Yi, and Zhou Zhi.<br>Having held a grudge against Chu Feng all this while, there was no way Zhou Shuang would miss this opportunity to trample over him. It was just that she was also afraid of him, which was why she only dared to secretly complain to her own family members.<br>In fact, she knew that Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t be fazed by this loss at all. He had nothing on the line for this bet, and their Zhou Clan wouldn&rsquo;t dare to do anything to him. Her goal was just to embarrass her younger sister, Zhou Yi, for having brought Chu Feng here.<br>Zhou Yi&rsquo;s expression turned heavy. She knew that their Zhou Clan couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose this bet, but her confidence in Chu Feng waned after sensing the tremendous power harnessed in young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s formation.<br>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!<br>All of a sudden, Chu Feng began making a move. A huge deluge of spirit power flowed out from his body and formed a formation within a split second.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done with the formation?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was stunned.<br>Most of the people present were world spiritists themselves, so they could tell that Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation was in a complete state. The problem was that could a formation formed at a whim really be sufficient to decipher the complicated test formation.<br>While the crowd was still trying to make sense of the situation, Chu Feng had already activated his deciphering formation. His formation released a burst of energy that instantaneously tore through the formation that young master Bai Yue had tossed out earlier.<br>The crowd was flabbergasted.<br>In just a few seconds, Chu Feng had deciphered the formation!<br>&ldquo;What the hell? Am I seeing things?&rdquo; The arrogant Zhou Zhi widened his eyes in shock.<br>Even young master Bai Yue was stunned too. He hadn&rsquo;t even finished constructing his deciphering formation, but Chu Feng was already done deciphering the test formation. It was clear that he had lost the bet, and it was an utter loss at that.<br></div>
