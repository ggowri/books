        <div> - Tracking Failed?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Everyone, don&rsquo;t worry. This here is really only a superficial wound.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I actually came here today to bid farewell to you all. I am going to leave the All-heaven Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The future is long, we will meet again someday. Farewell.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng stood up and clasped his fist at Zhao Hong and others. Then, he soared into the sky and began flying towards the distant horizon.<br>&ldquo;Asura, he&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Han Xiu and many others present were all baffled seeing Chu Feng leave like that.<br>His behavior was truly that of someone who came in a rush and left in a rush.<br>Furthermore, even though Chu Feng had said that he was fine, he had clearly suffered serious injuries.<br>There was still blood on the corners of his mouth.<br>Compared to others, Zhao Hong had a pondering look on her face.<br>What she was confused by was not how much of a rush Chu Feng was in.<br>Rather, she was confused by why Chu Feng had taken the risk to try to save Yin Zhuanghong. She felt that his behavior earlier and his behavior just then were rather fishy.<br>Due to her understanding of Chu Feng, she felt that he might have some other purpose in mind.<br>Unfortunately, she had no idea what his purpose was.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Zhao Hong&rsquo;s body shifted, and she disappeared. She went to chase after Chu Feng to secretly observe what he planned to do.<br>However, she soon found that she was unable to catch up to him. Rather, she was unable to find him at all.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had concealed himself with the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.<br>Furthermore, he had increased his speed to the max. He was flying ahead with his maximum speed.<br>The direction Chu Feng was flying was actually different from the direction that he'd left in.<br>The direction Chu Feng was flying in was the one that the war chariot that took Yin Zhuanghong had left in.<br>Chu Feng had deliberately left in a different direction so that he could change directions to chase after the war chariot.<br>His intention was to deceive Zhao Hong and the others.<br>The reason why he did that was naturally because he knew they'd be worried about him.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had planned to secretly rescue Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Earlier, Chu Feng had deliberately approached Lian Xi and had deliberately provoked him.<br>Even him being attacked was something that Chu Feng had planned for.<br>Chu Feng had left a special imprint formation on his body ahead of time.<br>As long as Lian Xi touched any part of his body, his imprint formation would leave a permanent imprint on him<br>Unless it got detected and removed by an expert world spiritist, the imprint simply wouldn&rsquo;t be discovered by him.<br>That was what was amazing about world spiritists.<br>Although they could not injure those more powerful than them, they were capable of many things that were impossible for martial cultivators.<br>The reason why Chu Feng had left the imprint was all so that he could chase after those people.<br>Using the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak&rsquo;s ability to conceal himself, Chu Feng could secretly tail those people and look for an opportunity to rescue Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Whilst others would not be able to detect Chu Feng&rsquo;s imprint, he would be able to sense it intensely.<br>The only problem was that even though he was chasing after them with his fastest speed, the intensity of the imprint was weakening more and more.<br>&ldquo;Those people are simply too fast.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If this is to continue, they&rsquo;ll shake me off sooner or later.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly where are they going? They&rsquo;ve passed by several Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formations already, but didn&rsquo;t go into any of them.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng began feeling confused.<br>He had suspected that those people were most definitely not from the All-heaven Starfield. He felt that they should be from some other powerful starfield.<br>It was likely due to a freak combination of factors that Yin Zhuanghong had ended up in the All-heaven Starfield.<br>Now that they&rsquo;d found her, they probably planned to bring her back.<br>Yet, they hadn&rsquo;t entered any of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formations that they&rsquo;d passed by. This caused Chu Feng to be confused as to exactly where they were heading.<br>&hellip;...<br>In the end, Chu Feng stopped chasing them.<br>The reason for that was because the aura being emitted by his imprint had completely disappeared.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that his imprint had been removed. It was just that the distance between him and the imprint was too far, so far that it had surpassed Chu Feng&rsquo;s sensing distance.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt unreconciled.<br>He had braved the risk of being beaten to death so that he could leave an imprint on Lian Xi<br>He did all of that so that he could rescue Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Furthermore, the imprint was the most intense the moment it was first placed onto someone.<br>That was the reason why even though those people were moving very fast and were very far away from Chu Feng. He'd still been able to chase after them for such a long time.<br>However, as time passed, the intensity of the imprint would to weaken.<br>The next time, unless he was very close to the imprint, Chu Feng would not be able to detect it at all.<br>Because of that, being shaken off this time was equivalent to him having failed the rescue mission.<br>There would only be two possible ways for Chu Feng to meet Yin Zhuanghong again in the future.<br>Either those people would return Yin Zhuanghong's freedom to her, and she returned to the Reincarnation Upper Realm to visit them.<br>Or, if Chu Feng managed to find out the identity of those people through their special characteristics and then seek out Yin Zhuanghong at their base.<br>Unfortunately, regardless of which of the two possibilities it occurred, it would still be a long time before it happened.<br>After feeling unreconciled for a while, Chu Feng began to examine his surroundings.<br>He began wondering if he should return to the Red-dress Holy Land to properly bid his farewell to Zhao Hong, or if he should return to the Ancestral Martial Starfield immediately.<br>&ldquo;Mn?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That mountain.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze shifted rapidly, and ultimately landed on a mountain range.<br>That mountain range did not appear to be special at all.<br>Its peak was not very tall, and its trees were not very special. There also weren't any exotic beasts present on the mountain.<br>Mountains as plain as this one were as numerous as weeds in the Upper Realms.<br>However, as Chu Feng was a world spiritist, his gaze was extremely sharp.<br>With merely a single glance, Chu Feng determined the mountain range to be rather special.<br>Thus, he activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>Under his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, gaseous flames actually rose from within the mountain.<br>The gaseous flames soared into the sky and passed through the clouds. Those gaseous flames faintly formed the image of an enormous dragon.<br>That enormous dragon lay above the mountain range.<br>A place where a dragon slept most definitely contained treasures.<br>Even though the abnormal sign emitted by the mountain range was extremely faint, a sign that signaled that the treasures could very possibly have been taken already, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t plan to let this potential opportunity pass him by, since he had already discovered it.<br>After examining the mountain, Chu Feng soon discovered an entrance.<br>&ldquo;This is man-made.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that someone owns this place?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng discovered that there was a concealment formation at the entrance.<br>Furthermore, after breaching the formation and entering, he discovered that the inside was also man-made.<br>Everything pointed to someone having already arrived before him. Furthermore, there were numerous signs of activity in the cave. This indicated that there were most likely people below.<br>&ldquo;Forget it. Since I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;ll have a look.&rdquo;<br>Although Chu Feng had entered the mountain, he still concealed himself with the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.<br>From the crude spirit formation at the entrance, Chu Feng had determined that even if there were people there, they were most definitely not very powerful.<br>He felt that even if there were people, they would not be able to discover him.<br>However, after proceeding further, Chu Feng started frowning.<br>As he went deeper into the mountain, Chu Feng was able to hear some sounds.<br>Those were not human sounds. Rather, they were the sounds of monstrous clansmen.<br>The reason why Chu Feng was frowning was because those sounds resembled screams.<br>This immediately caused Chu Feng to feel that something bad was very likely happening in the cave.<br>Chu Feng was a kind-hearted person. Seeing people suffering from misfortune, he would naturally not disregard them. As such, he increased his pace.<br>&ldquo;This sound?&rdquo;<br>Soon, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed. In fact, a look of astonishment was present in his eyes.<br>Among the sounds of the monstrous clansmen, he was able to hear a human&rsquo;s voice too.<br>Furthermore, it was a familiar voice.<br></p></div>
