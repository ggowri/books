        <h1>Chapter 4650</h1>
        <div>: Infiltrating the Asura Graveyard<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit hard for me to talk about this matter because this final trial involves my personal interests as well. To be frank, I would like to ask the two of you for a favor.&rdquo;<br>The renowned Wretched Black Demon actually had a slightly conflicted look on his face at this very moment.<br>However, Chu Feng had already expected such a turn of events.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please feel free to speak. Be it to scale a mountain of knives or descend into a sea of flames, I&rsquo;m willing to give it all I got,&rdquo; Gongsun Yuntian suddenly stood up and spoke with an earnest attitude.<br>This fellow was usually quite arrogant, giving even his own kin the cold shoulders. Yet, before the Wretched Black Demon, he put on a polite and upright appearance.<br>But of course, everyone could tell that he was just bootlicking here.<br>In the end, Gongsun Yuntian was just a person who feared the strong and oppressed the weak, just like the other prodigies. The only difference was that Gongsun Yuntian was stronger than most prodigies.<br>The Wretched Black Demon nodded his head in response before finally revealing his true motive.<br>To put it simply, the Wretched Black Demon wanted to send Chu Feng and Gongsun Yuntian into the Asura Graveyard to steal something. He didn&rsquo;t reveal what the item was used for, but he promised that if any one of them could bring the item to him, that person would get to marry his granddaughter.<br>On top of that, regardless of whether they succeeded or not, the two of them would be rewarded for their efforts.<br>&ldquo;Young friends, the Asura Graveyard is a very dangerous place. I understand if you don&rsquo;t wish to proceed on with it, and it&rsquo;s not too late for you to back down now. I don&rsquo;t intend to force you into anything,&rdquo; the Wretched Black Demon said.<br>From his words, it would appear that he didn&rsquo;t intend to make things difficult for Chu Feng and Gongsun Yuntian.<br>However, Chu Feng sharply noticed a change in the Wretched Black Demon&rsquo;s gaze when he said those words. The change was very slight, disappearing in the blink of an eye, but Chu Feng still got a bad vibe from it.<br>He felt that the Wretched Black Demon was just speaking pretty words before him. If any one of them dared to reject his request, it was unlikely that he would really let them off easily.<br>However, that hardly mattered as neither Chu Feng nor Gongsun Yuntian had any intentions of backing down now.<br>Gongsun Yuntian was here for the marriage convention, and Chu Feng wanted to enter the Asura Graveyard. Their goals were just right ahead of them, so regardless of the dangers, they wouldn&rsquo;t let this opportunity slip past their fingers.<br>Thus, Chu Feng and Gongsun Yuntian unhesitatingly agreed to it.<br>While the Wretched Black Demon didn&rsquo;t make it too obvious, Chu Feng could still sense his delight when the two of them agreed to help him. It would appear that he was worried that Chu Feng and Gongsun Yuntian would turn him down.<br>&ldquo;Young friends, even though you are competitors in his mission, I still hope that you can cooperate with one another. I promise that as long as the two of you return safely, even if you fail to bring back the item I want, I&rsquo;ll reward you. But of course, just to be safe, I&rsquo;ll need to set up a formation on your bodies. This formation will protect you.&rdquo;<br>As the Wretched Black Demon said those words, he began constructing a formation.<br>This formation would ensure that neither of the two of them could hurt one another during a period of time.<br>&ldquo;Alright, change into this.&rdquo;<br>The Wretched Black Demon took out two boxes and passed them over to Chu Feng and Gongsun Yuntian respectively. When Chu Feng opened the box, he was a little surprised.<br>There was actually a set of black armor and a black saber inside the box. These two items were exquisitely made, and they were intended for a world spirit&rsquo;s use.<br>Gongsun Yuntian also received the same items as well.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess was that these were the items donned by the evil spirits in the Asura Graveyard. After all, the reason why they tempered their bodies and changed their form and aura was so as to disguise themselves as evil spirits.<br>However, it would appear that the evil spirits that were in the Asura Graveyard were different from what Chu Feng was imagining.<br>The evil spirits that Chu Feng had met in the past were mostly monstrous beings. They did possess intelligence and were strong, but they chose to live freely, not allowing anything to restrain them.<br>On the other hand, the two of them actually had to wear similar armor and weapons in order to infiltrate into the Asura Graveyard. It was almost as if they were being conscripted into an army.<br>This refreshed Chu Feng&rsquo;s view of the evil spirits in the Asura Graveyard. Most likely, there was a different sort of order there.<br>&ldquo;Remember this. As soon as you enter the Asura Graveyard, make sure to conceal the spirit formation gate first. Also, stay on the spot and don&rsquo;t wander around. I have an insider in there to receive you. Just listen to his instructions for the rest of the operation.<br>&ldquo;However, when you meet the insider, you need to mention the passcode first. He&rsquo;ll respond accordingly upon hearing the passcode, and that&rsquo;s when you know that you can trust him. As soon as you complete the mission, return back the same way from where you came from.&rdquo;<br>The Wretched Black Demon instructed before relaying the passcodes to Chu Feng and Gongsun Yuntian. Then, he ushered the two of them toward the humongous formation in the hall.<br>As soon as the two of them stepped into the formation and sat down, the Wretched Black Demon quickly headed for the formation core.<br>Boom!<br>Spirit power poured out like a tsunami from the Wretched Black Demon, leaving Chu Feng feeling as if a storm had been raised in the surroundings. The spirit power was channeled solely toward the activation of the formation, but he still felt an overwhelming pressure from it.<br>He was unable to discern which rank of Dragon Transformation Sensation the Wretched Black Demon was at, but without a doubt, he was incredibly powerful. At the very least, Chu Feng was just an insignificant being in his face.<br>Boom!<br>Soon, the formation began to rumble, and a sharp whirring sound echoed behind Chu Feng. Vaguely, he thought that he heard the sound of something shaking intensely, as well as furious gushing waves.<br>The formation came to life, and an unimaginable surge of energy began revolving around Chu Feng and Gongsun Yuntian.<br>Even for someone as powerful as the Wretched Black Demon, his face actually began to pale in frailty while driving the formation. Beads of sweat dripped from his cheeks.<br>&ldquo;Oh my, what a formidable formation. He must have spent a lot of effort and money to construct it, and its purpose is to teleport you two into the Asura Graveyard? It looks like the item he wants the two of you to obtain is rather dangerous. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have prepared so long and spent so much time and energy on it.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you really intending on going over? I don&rsquo;t feel good about this.&rdquo;<br>Even Eggy started feeling a little anxious by the sheer scale of what was going on. Of course, her anxiety stemmed not from fear but worry for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Eggy. If anything happens, I have my way of escaping,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Are you certain that you have the ability to escape from a place like the Asura Graveyard?&rdquo; Eggy cast doubt over Chu Feng&rsquo;s confident declaration.<br>&ldquo;I guess so&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with an awkward chuckle.<br>He had never been to the Asura Graveyard before, so there was no way he could say for sure.<br>&ldquo;However, now that we&rsquo;re already in this formation, it&rsquo;s already too late for regrets,&rdquo; Chu Feng added.<br>It was indeed already too late.<br>The face of the Wretched Black Demon had started to scrunch tightly together, revealing a ferocious look, and he even released furious roars. At the same time, raging spirit power gushed out of his body.<br>He was using his full power to drive the formation.<br>Soon, this overwhelmingly powerful teleportation formation was finally fully activated.<br>Chu Feng sensed all of those whirring sounds around gradually fading, and a surge of light seemed to gush before his eyes. Gradually, his vision was overwhelmed by the light, such that the surroundings began to blur.<br>It took a long time before the light finally scattered, and everything reverted back to normal.<br>When Chu Feng opened his eyes once more, he was still in a hall, but not in the same one as before.<br>&ldquo;Is this the Asura Graveyard?&rdquo; Chu Feng muttered softly.<br></p></div>
