        <h1>Chapter 4267</h1>
        <div> - Without A Master<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the crowd watched in disbelief, the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects that covered Chu Feng&rsquo;s body soon disappeared completely.<br>Not long after, Chu Feng regained consciousness.<br>At this moment, the surroundings turned strangely quiet.<br>The hundreds of millions of people were all silent at this moment.<br>Truth was, they were terrified by Chu Feng.<br>They were looking at Chu Feng like a monster as he crawled back up from the ground.<br>Chu Feng who had a look of pain all across his face earlier now had a rosy complexion.<br>Even the injuries he sustained from the red chessboard seemed to be completely healed.<br>It was as if the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects not only did not bring him any harm, they instead nourished him.<br>Seeing this, even Lu Jie had a lifeless look in his eyes.<br>How could there be a person in this world that didn&rsquo;t fear the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects when their cultivation hasn&rsquo;t reached Martial Exalted?<br>At this moment, Chu Feng smiled. That smile shocked the crowd.<br>But, that was not the most shocking matter. What shocked them even more was what Chu Feng said after.<br>&ldquo;These Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects are truly decent. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s not enough of them,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>Not enough?<br>A single Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insect was already dangerously fatal.<br>The amount of Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects that entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s body earlier could be said to be a lot already. Yet, Chu Feng was complaining about there not being enough?<br>&ldquo;What sort of nonsense is that Chu Feng spouting?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s actually calling the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects decent?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those are fatally dangerous poisonous insects!!!&rdquo;<br>The crowd gasped in surprise repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;When young friend Chu Feng was plotted against by that vile old Beast Tamer, he said that the Realms&rsquo; Ghost Talisman Insects were able to increase his spirit power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The amount of Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects that entered his body that day were far lesser than the amount today. Likely, the benefit he reaped today is even greater.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen stroked his beard and spoke with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re actually able to increase one&rsquo;s spirit power?&rdquo;<br>Had Grandmaster Tang Chen not mentioned it, the crowd truly had no idea the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects possessed that sort of effect.<br>After all, practically everyone inflicted with the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects will end up dying.<br>Truth was, if someone told them that the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects actually possess miraculous effects for world spiritists before, if they told them that they were precious treasures capable of increasing one&rsquo;s spirit power, the crowd will definitely curse that person out for being crazy.<br>But now, they firmly believed it to be true.<br>After all, Chu Feng&rsquo;s complexion had turned rosy and he looked to be full of vigor. Even if the crowd didn&rsquo;t wish to believe it to be true, they had no choice but to do so.<br>&ldquo;Judging from this, it would appear that it was true that the Revered Master Beast Tamer had plotted against Chu Feng,&rdquo; said Celestial Fairy Muzhi as she stared at Revered Master Beast Tamer. There was a trace of ill-intent in her eyes.<br>Chu Feng had given her a lot of benefits earlier.<br>She was pondering about how to repay him for his assistance. And now&hellip; it seemed like she had found the way to repay him.<br>&ldquo;Celestial Fairy Muzhi, you cannot make that sort of irresponsible remark. Even if Chu Feng is able to refine the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects, that cannot prove that I had plotted against him.&rdquo;<br>Revered Master Beast Tamer denied what he did. But, he actually hid himself behind Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted when he said those words. He was deeply afraid that someone might try to attack him.<br>Seeing his reaction and recalling his character, the crowd already knew the truth regardless of how he tried to deny things.<br>What Grandmaster Tang Chen said must be the truth. Revered Master Beast Tamer had most definitely plotted against Chu Feng. Unfortunately, he encountered a monster.<br>That monster was so powerful that not even the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects were able to do anything to him.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, light appeared on the stele again.<br>When the crowd looked to the stele again, their eyes were completely fixed. Many people started to breathe heavily.<br>The stele that was originally devoid of anything was now circulating with sacred vein lines.<br>At the same thing, that enticing aura appeared again.<br>Following that, the ancient voice sounded.<br>&ldquo;With your talent, you are qualified to receive this old man&rsquo;s inheritance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, you are still very young and your cultivation very weak. You will not be able to protect my inheritance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As such, the inheritance shall remain here temporarily. You will only be able to bring away the inheritance when your master comes here.&rdquo;<br>Once those words were spoken, the expressions of the crowd all changed. They were filled with envy toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s master.<br>By this point, they all knew that Chu Feng had received the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain&rsquo;s acknowledgement and was qualified to receive the inheritance.<br>Unfortunately, as Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was lacking, his master needed to receive the inheritance on his behalf.<br>That would be equivalent to Chu Feng&rsquo;s master being the one to really receive the inheritance.<br>&ldquo;Exactly who is Chu Feng&rsquo;s master? They&rsquo;ve picked up an enormous treasure!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It has always been the disciple that receives benefits from one&rsquo;s master. It&rsquo;s the first time that I&rsquo;m seeing a master benefitting from one&rsquo;s disciple.&rdquo;<br>The crowd were both envious toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s master and curious who his master was.<br>With how outstanding Chu Feng was, they believed that Chu Feng&rsquo;s master was most definitely not someone ordinary either.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I don&rsquo;t possess a master. Is it unable for me to retrieve this inheritance myself?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No master?!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words immediately caused a massive commotion.<br>Not to mention the rest of the crowd, even Grandmaster Tang Chen and Yuan Shu were completely confused.<br>When Chu Feng said he didn&rsquo;t have a master earlier, the crowd felt that it was because he didn&rsquo;t wish to expose his master&rsquo;s identity.<br>But, for him to say that he doesn&rsquo;t have a master at such a time, could it be that he really doesn&rsquo;t possess a master?<br>&ldquo;It must be retrieved by your master. If you do not have one, go and find one. After finding a master, you can bring your master here,&rdquo; said that ancient voice.<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng narrowed his brows after hearing those words. He truly never expected to encounter this sort of outlandish matter after obtaining the inheritance with great difficulty.<br>How was he supposed to deal with this? After all, he had sworn that he would never take a master.<br>If he was to take a master now, it would be truly unfair to the people that he had refused in the past.<br>The crowd noticed the difficulty Chu Feng was under.<br>Seeing this, many people revealed looks of joy.<br>From Chu Feng&rsquo;s reaction, they detected a possibility -- this exceptional genius might really not have a master.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, if you don&rsquo;t mind, how about this old man become your master?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice exploded in the sky.<br>The person who spoke was actually Grandmaster Luo Tuo.<br>&ldquo;Luo Tuo, are you so thick-skinned that you don&rsquo;t even care about your self-respect?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You were the one cursing Chu Feng earlier. You actually have the nerve to ask him to take you as his master?&rdquo;<br>Celestial Fairy Muzhi was unable to contain herself from criticizing Grandmaster Luo Tuo.<br>But, Grandmaster Luo Tuo completely ignored her. He continued to speak to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, what happened earlier was a misunderstanding. This old man wasn&rsquo;t aiming at you intentionally.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you take me as your master, I will help you retrieve the inheritance and then return it to you. What do you think about that?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng shook his head repeatedly. The smile on his face revealed his answer.<br>How could he possibly take Grandmaster Luo Tuo as his master?<br>After all, that old fart was someone that wanted to kill him earlier.<br>Seeing that Grandmaster Luo Tuo was rejected, the others saw hope.<br>Thus, many people began to speak to Chu Feng. They all hoped to become his master.<br>Those with weaker strength did not dare to speak openly like Grandmaster Luo Tuo. Instead, they began to speak to him through voice transmission.<br>Most exasperating of all, even Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted voiced his intention to become Chu Feng&rsquo;s master.<br>&ldquo;Fuck! These people are truly shameless.&rdquo;<br>Seeing how those people were all trying to take advantage of Chu Feng, Celestial Fairy Muzhi cursed out loud. Then, her expression changed and, with a beaming smile, she waved her hand at Chu Feng and spoke loudly, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you cannot trust those people. If you really don&rsquo;t have a master, why don&rsquo;t you become the disciple of this Celestial Fairy? Not only will I not take your inheritance, I will even impart you all my knowledge and abilities!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this, both Grandmaster Tang Chen and Old Man Compliance had black lines rolling down their foreheads.<br>Simply no one would&rsquo;ve imagined that the people that were cursing Chu Feng out earlier were trying to become Chu Feng&rsquo;s master through various means.<br>Before desire, people would truly become as shameless as they could be.<br>This was truly what it meant to be absurd.<br>But, this sort of absurdity was a common occurrence!<br></p></div>
