        <h1>Chapter 5089</h1>
        <div>: Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s Hand<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Sima Xiangtu suddenly burst into laughter. His voice that was tinged in indignance and rage felt unnerving.<br>Chu Feng kept his eyes on Sima Xiangtu. The absence of Yao Cheng and the 32 puppets, which he hadn&rsquo;t been able to confirm the cultivation of, had not gone past his notice. While Sima Xiangtu appeared to be a goner given the current situation, he didn&rsquo;t dare to make light of the man.<br>He didn&rsquo;t order the Asura World Spirit Army to eliminate Sima Xiangtu thus far because he thought that it would be letting the latter off light, but he made sure to order the Asura King to keep a close eye on him.<br>&ldquo;The Pill Dao Immortal Sect is indeed untrustworthy. It&rsquo;s one thing for you not to protect me, but you actually chose to side with Chu Feng to deal with me? You&rsquo;ll regret your decision today.&rdquo;<br>Spirit power appeared around Sima Xiangtu.<br>&ldquo;Elder, do it!&rdquo; Chu Feng ordered the Asura King.<br>Weng!<br>The Asura King immediately exerted his powerful oppressive might that could easily crush Sima Xiangtu into bits, but for some reason, it wasn&rsquo;t reaching the latter at all. The spirit power had formed a barrier around Sima Xiangtu to protect him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t underestimate me. The trash of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect is nothing more than my chess pieces. We&rsquo;ll meet again.&rdquo;<br>Sima Xiangtu shot a look at Chu Feng before vanishing into thin air. Disappearing with him was Chu Feng&rsquo;s master, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng cursed with a livid look on his face.<br>He did expect Sima Xiangtu to have prepared an escape plan, but he didn&rsquo;t think that the latter would actually be able to successfully escape right under the eyelid of the Asura King. Most important of all, he even took the Ox-nosed Old Daoist with him.<br>&ldquo;Chase him! Find that man at all costs!&rdquo; the Asura King ordered.<br>The Asura World Spirit Army immediately dispersed to search for Sima Xiangtu, but Chu Feng knew that it was futile. There was no way Sima Xiangtu would be so careless as to get himself caught right after making his escape.<br>&ldquo;That Sima scoundrel actually had such a treasure on him. You must be careful, Chu Feng. Based on what I know, Sima Xiangtu possesses exceptional talent. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before he makes a comeback,&rdquo; Jiang Kongping walked over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side and said.<br>&ldquo;Talent?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was taken aback to hear those words.<br>He conceded that Sima Xiangtu was indeed a cunning man, but he didn&rsquo;t think that the latter was particularly talented. Otherwise, he should have already reached Half-God level at his age.<br>&ldquo;I understand your astonishment, but Sima Xiangtu is far more talented than you expect.&rdquo;<br>Jiang Kongping shared the astonishing result of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s talent assessment treasure with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Is what you said true?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in disbelief.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I have no reason to lie to you about this. Despite Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s unassuming appearance, he has many means in his possession. He&rsquo;s not someone we can underestimate. It&rsquo;ll be best for you to tread carefully,&rdquo; Jiang Kongping said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful of Sima Xiangtu, but I&rsquo;m more worried about your Pill Dao Immortal Sect,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, allow me to tell you something.&rdquo;<br>Jiang Kongping told Chu Feng about how all of them present here had already left the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. He could only guarantee that their group of people wouldn&rsquo;t be hostile toward Chu Feng, but he couldn&rsquo;t say the same about the rest in the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.<br>Even Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s father didn&rsquo;t have the power to interfere in the affairs of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect anymore.<br>&ldquo;Brother Kongping, I want to make it clear here that I&rsquo;m not afraid of trouble. I could have killed all of you here, but I chose not to do so because I don&rsquo;t want to kill you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you don&rsquo;t have to say anything more. We might have phrased it as a ceasefire, but I&rsquo;m aware that you have spared our lives today on my account. I guess this conflict did bring us closer together. I do admire you as a person, and I trust that you can feel it too. Putting all things aside, I already see you as a friend,&rdquo; Jiang Kongping said.<br>The two of them chatted together a little, and Jiang Taibai even joined in for a while.<br>Chu Feng was hoping to gather more information about Sima Xiangtu from them since the latter had taken the Ox-nosed Old Daoist together with him, but unfortunately, they had no idea where Sima Xiangtu could have gone.<br>This left Chu Feng feeling incredibly insecure. He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of Sima Xiangtu exacting vengeance on him, but he was worried about his master&rsquo;s safety.<br></p></div>
