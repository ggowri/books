        <div> - Being Made A Fool<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>At that moment, one of the Starfall Eight Immortals coughed and said to Chu Xianshuo, &ldquo;Young master Chu Xianshuo, while it is fine to joke around, please pay attention to your words.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, I most definitely did not possess any intention of offending the Holy Daughter. I&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Xianshuo turned green in the face and immediately tried to explain himself.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have the intention to offend the Holy Daughter? In that case, it would mean that your words were aimed at me?&rdquo; Chu Feng interrupted Chu Xianshuo before he could finish his words.<br>&ldquo;However, there is no grievance or hatred between us. In fact, it&rsquo;s the first time that we&rsquo;ve met. Why would you mock and ridicule me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be because you all wanted to see the Holy Daughter but were unable to meet her whereas I, on the other hand, managed to see her that caused you all to become jealous of me, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;DId you all verbally attack me because you grew to hate me due to jealousy?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I guessed correctly, you all also plan to attack me and teach me a lesson, no?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Bullshit! Who the hell do you think you are?! What makes you think that we would be jealous of you?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, all of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s young masters and young ladies were furious.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>However, Chu Feng actually chuckled at the furious Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations. He said, &ldquo;You all know best in your hearts whether or not you&rsquo;re jealous.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng took a leap and jumped down from the summit.<br>At that moment, those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s young masters and young ladies were all gnashing their teeth angrily. Anger and murderous desire filled their eyes.<br>After Chu Feng descended from the summit, the crowd down below all gathered around him and began to question him.<br>They were all questioning Chu Feng about exactly what the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter looked like.<br>There were also people that asked Chu Feng whether or not he had taken advantage of the Holy Daughter.<br>However, Chu Feng completely ignored them. He grabbed Song Xi and planned to leave. He started flying toward the direction of the Immortal Armament Villa.<br>Chu Feng had already realized that those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were planning to take care of him. Thus, he had to leave immediately.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, did you manage to see the Holy Daughter? Exactly what does the Holy Daughter look like?&rdquo;<br>Evidently, Song Xi did not notice the looming crisis. At that moment, he had a very excited expression on his face as he questioned Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get to see her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see her? But we all clearly saw you enter the palace,&rdquo; Song Xi was very surprised.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not it. How could I not believe you?&rdquo; Song Xi shook his head.<br>It was not that Song Xi did not believe Chu Feng. He was merely extremely surprised.<br>It was clearly the Holy Daughter who had invited Chu Feng up there. Thus, why would she not meet him?<br>Song Xi was truly unable to understand.<br>&ldquo;Do you know the name of the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I do. Her name&rsquo;s Xia Yun&rsquo;er. That name is truly a pleasant-sounding one,&rdquo; Song Xi said with a joyful smile on his face. It would appear that merely the Holy Daughter&rsquo;s name was enough to make him completely fascinated.<br>&ldquo;That Xia Yun&rsquo;er is not a good individual. It&rsquo;s best that you keep your distance from her in the future,&rdquo; Chu Feng whispered to Song Xi.<br>He was not really trying to warn Song Xi. Rather, it was more like Chu Feng was joking with him.<br>After all, Chu Feng was able to tell that Song Xi was completely infatuated with the Holy Daughter.<br>&ldquo;Ah? What do you mean by that?&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, Song Xi revealed a completely astonished expression upon hearing what Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I was made a fool of by her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Made a fool of?&rdquo; Song Xi grew even more confused.<br>&ldquo;She deliberately called me up there, but never even bothered to see me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;She merely wanted those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations to feel resentful toward me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even I only noticed that after leaving the palace,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding! Is there some sort of grievance between you and the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter?&rdquo; Song Xi asked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I know her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Then that shouldn&rsquo;t be the case, no? The Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter has always been a gentle and kind-hearted individual. Why would she try to bring harm upon you for no reason?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that you&rsquo;re overthinking things?&rdquo; Song Xi said.<br>&ldquo;I hope that I am overthinking things,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>However, Chu Feng had realized that things were bad the moment he felt the gazes containing killing intent when he exited the palace.<br>From that point on, Chu Feng knew that those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations planned to take care of him.<br>Those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were most definitely not planning to let things be after mocking and sneering at him.<br>The reason for that was because their killing intent was very true. They were truly planning to kill Chu Feng.<br>That was also the reason why Chu Feng did not submit to their humiliation at the summit of the mountain peak, and instead returned their ridicule.<br>Since they were clearly planning to kill him, there was no need for him to submit to their humiliation.<br>Merely, that Chu Xianshuo&rsquo;s strength surpassed his own. That was why Chu Feng immediately brought Song Xi with him and escaped.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s destination was the Immortal Armament Villa. He felt that since the Immortal Armament Villa was the one holding the hunt, they should protect them once they arrived at the Immortal Armament Villa.<br>At the very least, they most likely wouldn&rsquo;t allow the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations to act impudently.<br>Of course, this was merely what Chu Feng guessed would happen.<br>There was another possibility. That is, the Immortal Armament Villa would fear the Chu Heavenly Clan. Thus, they would not do anything even if the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations tried to openly kill someone in their territory.<br>However, there was no other choice for Chu Feng at the moment. Since he had already arrived, he couldn't let his trip be in vain. Regardless, he would have to proceed for the Immortal Armament Villa.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at the moment when Chu Feng was rapidly traveling, a boundless oppressive might suddenly appeared before Chu Feng.<br>That oppressive might was extremely aggressive. It rushed straight for Chu Feng. At that very instant, a vast wind emerged, and the clouds were blown away.<br>Everything happened too suddenly. Chu Feng was simply unable to dodge the incoming oppressive might. He also did not have the time to react to it.<br>When that oppressive might enveloped Chu Feng, he lost the ability to fly, and was unable to even move a finger.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng and Song Xi were like two leaves. They rolled around repeatedly in the sky.<br>Then, they started falling straight down. &ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; &ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; Like two meteorites, Chu Feng and Song Xi crashed ruthlessly into the ground.<br>The two of them had pierced deep into the ground.<br>Chu Feng did not feel any pain after being smashed into the ground. However, he was very worried for Song Xi. After all, Song Xi&rsquo;s cultivation was very weak.<br>Thus, Chu Feng hurriedly spread his spirit power out to see how Song Xi was doing.<br>Fortunately, Song Xi seemed to be fine too.<br>It would appear that the person who had smashed them onto the ground did not plan to harm them.<br>At the very least&hellip; they were not planning to harm them yet.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. Sure enough, you&rsquo;re nothing more than trash.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, mocking laughter sounded from the sky above.<br>Although Chu Feng was unable to raise his head, he was able to see the situation using his spirit power.<br>It was those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations. All of those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations that were present on the summit earlier were in the sky above them.<br>The person that was restricting Chu Feng with his oppressive might was that Chu Xianshuo with a cultivation of rank four True Immortal.<br>&ldquo;How could they appear without any sign? Could it be that they possess some sort of treasure on them that concealed their auras and allowed them to stealthily approach us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That must be the case. Damn it, I was careless!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng started to regret not rushing away with his fastest speed.<br>Actually, Chu Feng was prepared for the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations. He had extended his spirit power outward the entire time.<br>Under normal circumstances, Chu Feng would definitely have been able to detect them should Chu Xianshuo and the others chase after him.<br>However, it was clear that he had made a miscalculation. There could only be one possibility as to why he had miscalculated.<br>That is, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation had relied on some sort of treasure that could conceal their auras to quietly chase after and overtake Chu Feng.<br>This was something that Chu Feng had not expected. After all, Chu Feng felt that with how proud and arrogant they were, they would definitely chase after him openly and aggressively should they want to chase after him.<br>He had never expected for them to be so sneaky.<br>However, regardless of how it happened, he had miscalculated. Because of his miscalculation, he had to pay the price.<br>That is, Chu Feng had lost the decisive opportunity. As his opponents had attacked first, he was already completely suppressed.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng could only allow himself to be ordered around by them. Even if they wanted to kill him, there was nothing he could do. He had no way of fighting back.<br>&ldquo;Brat! Who are you? You dare speak to us in such a rude manner?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, that Chu Xianshuo&rsquo;s voice sounded. At that moment, Song Xi was still lying in the ground. However, Chu Feng had already floated out from the deep crater.<br>It was not that Chu Feng had managed to escape the restriction of the oppressive might. Rather, it was that the oppressive might that had controlled his body, brought him out from the crater and made him stand on the ground.<br>At that moment, those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations led by Chu Xianshuo also descended from the sky and uniformly landed before Chu Feng.<br>They were all looking at Chu Feng with gazes of disdain.<br>Their gazes were filled with the intention of looking down on Chu Feng. Those were simply not gazes that one would look at a person with. Instead, it was as if they were looking at an animal, a dog.<br><br><br></p></div>
