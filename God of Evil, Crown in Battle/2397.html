        <div> - Martial Cultivation Spittoon<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Chu Feng and the others soon arrived at the Kong Heavenly Clan.<br>Their journey could be said to have been very secretive. Logically, no one should be able to know that the Kong Heavenly Clan had managed to invite Chu Feng and Wang Qiang.<br>However, surprisingly, this news was still leaked.<br>Soon, many people received the news, and began to arrive at the Kong Heavenly Clan in succession.<br>Their main purpose in their journey to the Kong Heavenly Clan was to become acquainted with Chu Feng and Wang Qiang.<br>It would be one thing if those that arrived at the Kong Heavenly Clan were small sects and schools. However, the ones that had arrived were all grand characters, famous throughout the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. This caused Kong Zheng, Kong Cheng and the other members of the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation to fully realize how amazing Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were right now.<br>Young and promising Immortal-cloak World Spiritists. Martial cultivation geniuses with heaven-defying battle power. Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s successors. Unknown, yet mysterious origins.<br>All of this caused Chu Feng and Wang Qiang to become the favorites of all the various grand characters present. Everyone was trying to seize the opportunity to befriend Chu Feng and Wang Qiang before they truly matured and grew powerful, so that they could pave a road for their own futures.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were basking in the limelight. They had the appearance of being able to surpass the strongest genius in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, Young Master Li Ming.<br>In fact, there were already many people saying that it was very possible for Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong to become the strongest geniuses in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm and rule over the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm with no equal, like Grandmaster Kai Hong did before.<br>At that moment. Within a luxurious palace in the Kong Heavenly Clan. Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were sitting inside a palace hall.<br>A layer of spirit formation covered the palace hall. It was a concealment formation capable of containing sound.<br>Although Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were enjoying the honored guest treatment here, the two of them did not consider themselves to be guests. Rather, they considered themselves to be lambs that had entered the tiger&rsquo;s den. As such, the two of them were extremely careful in all aspects. They were even unwilling to let others hear their conversations.<br>&ldquo;R-really! E-every day, w-we have to m-meet those old fellows that c-come to pay a visit. S-so annoying! Who w-was it that was such a l-loudmouth as to l-leak this news?&rdquo; Wang Qiang said in an annoyed manner.<br>&ldquo;If my guess is correct, it would most likely be your wife,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Z-Z-Zhao Hong?&rdquo; Wang Qiang revealed a surprised expression.<br>&ldquo;Who else would do this other than her?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Wang Qiang began to ponder the matter carefully. After thinking about it over and over again, he discovered that there really didn&rsquo;t seem to be anyone other than Zhao Hong who would be able to spread the news of them being in the Kong Heavenly Clan in such a short period of time.<br>&ldquo;W-why is s-she spreading t-this information all o-over the p-place instead of h-hurrying to the Phoenix Flame C-City to find her treasure? Isn&rsquo;t s-she creating more trouble for us?&rdquo; Wang Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;Zhao Hong is not trying to cause trouble for us. On the contrary, she is helping us,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You m-mean to say&hellip;?&rdquo; Wang Qiang was not slow. He immediately thought of something upon hearing what Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Before we came here, we were all unable to be certain whether or not the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s invitation was a plot. Even though the chances of it being a plot are very slim, it remains that it is possible.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If the news of us being guests here spreads, the Kong Heavenly Clan will definitely not be able to escape responsibility should any accident befall us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, a lot of people now know that we are guests in the Kong Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In this sort of situation, the Kong Heavenly Clan would have to be afraid of the consequences should they try to do anything to us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, Zhao Hong spread this news out of consideration for our safety. Perhaps this might be the actual reason why she didn&rsquo;t want to accompany us to the Kong Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Hehe&hellip; never w-would I have e-expected that d-damned woman to be t-this thoughtful. S-she is t-truly worthy of being my w-wife,&rdquo; Wang Qiang laughed complacently.<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, Zhao Hong is much smarter than you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Tsk,&rdquo; Wang Qiang did not get angry from Chu Feng speaking ill of him. Instead, he revealed a grand appearance and said, &ldquo;How c-could a m-mere mortal l-like you possibly u-understand my w-wits?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled and went along with Wang Qiang. That said, Chu Feng truly felt that at times he really was unable to see through Wang Qiang.<br>Suddenly, Wang Qiang said to Chu Feng in a very serious manner, &ldquo;Brother, w-w-we will have to m-meet those o-old farts c-coming to pay us v-visits everyday. If t-this continues, I f-fear that the s-spirit formation y-you want to use will h-have to be d-delayed far in-into the indefinite f-future.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;H-how about w-we not bother m-meeting those old farts anymore so t-that we c-can focus on s-setting up your spirit f-formation?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng and Wang Qiang had not gone to the Kong Heavenly Clan for leisure. They had gone for Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s treasures.<br>However, upon arriving, Chu Feng discovered that while the location of the treasures was not a forbidden area, it was guarded. In order to not to arouse the suspicions of others, Chu Feng had to first conceal this matter from everyone else if he wanted to enter that place.<br>However, the Kong Heavenly Clan possessed numerous experts; they even had more than a single True Immortal-level expert. With Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation, how could he possibly conceal himself from the detection of all those experts?<br>Thus, Chu Feng began to set up a spirit formation together with Wang Qiang.<br>That spirit formation was created by Grandmaster Kai Hong. As long as they successfully set up that spirit formation, the spirit formation would be able to completely conceal Chu Feng for a short period of time after it was activated. Even True Immortal-level experts would not be able to see Chu Feng or sense his aura.<br>Merely, as the spirit formation was very powerful, it was naturally also very difficult to set up, and was definitely not something that ordinary people could set up. Even for Chu Feng and Wang Qiang, who had obtained Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s inheritance, the spirit formation remained extremely difficult to set up.<br>Over the last few days, other than spending time meeting those people that came to pay them a visit, Chu Feng and Wang Qiang had been setting up the spirit formation practically the entire time. However, even with that being the case, the two of them had only managed to complete a tenth of the spirit formation over the course of the last few days.<br>From this, it could be seen how difficult that spirit formation was.<br>&ldquo;We are meeting those people so that they will know that the two of us are really guests here, so that they will spread the news.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, thinking about it, we have seen practically all that we should already. As such, we can stop meeting the remaining people,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Then&hellip; w-what s-should we do to s-stop seeing them?&rdquo; Wang Qiang asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s simple. We merely need to tell them that we&rsquo;re going to enter closed-door training,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;T-that&rsquo;s a great s-suggestion.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, b-brother, this is no small matter, and I am unable to a-accompany you. Thus, y-you should use that first,&rdquo; As Wang Qiang spoke, he took out a spittoon from his Cosmos Sack.<br>It was a very shabby spittoon. In fact, regardless of how much one tried to air out the spittoon, it would still emit a very nauseating scent.<br>However, this shabby spittoon was emitting a magnificent light. Looking into the spittoon, one could see that the light was coming from scriptures. The scriptures were extremely complicated, and definitely not ordinary characters.<br>If one were to use one&rsquo;s naked eye to observe it, one would not be able to tell what the contents of the scriptures were. Only by using one&rsquo;s heart to comprehend the scriptures would one be able to realize their meaning.<br>That said, each and every character contained enormous information, information regarding the profoundness of the path of martial cultivation.<br>To put it simply, the spittoon contained knowledge regarding the path of martial cultivation. If Chu Feng were to comprehend its contents with his heart, it was very possible that he would attain enlightenment and make a breakthrough, increasing his cultivation in the process.<br>Merely, the contents contained in the spittoon could only be attained by a single person. If Chu Feng was to use this spittoon, Wang Qiang would no longer be able to use it again. Furthermore&hellip; the profoundness of martial cultivation was not something that could be shared. To put it simply, although the spittoon was powerful, it could only be used once by a single person.<br>As for the spittoon, it was actually something that Wang Qiang had obtained from the treasures in the Drought Demon&rsquo;s Damned Pond. Merely, Wang Qiang did not directly comprehend the profoundness of martial cultivation contained within the spittoon immediately. Rather, he had kept the spittoon untouched.<br>The reason for that was because he wanted to save it for Chu Feng.<br><br></p></div>
