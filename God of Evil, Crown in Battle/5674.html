        <h1>Chapter 5674: The Right Owner</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Asura King, Kui Ting, and the top experts of the Asura World Spirit Army, such as </span><span>Yunliang</span><span> and </span><span>Xiangji</span><span>, all appeared before Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their cultivation was stronger than before, and it was a significant growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xiangji</span><span>, </span><span>Yunliang</span><span>, and the others were previously at rank six Half-God level, and their cultivation plummeted to rank three Half-God level after contracting with Chu Feng. However, they were now at rank eight Half-God level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the Asura King, he was previously at rank seven Half-God level, and his cultivation regressed to rank four Half-God level after contracting with Chu Feng. However, he was now a rank nine Half-God level expert, just a step away from reaching True God level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a height they had never reached, and it had happened in an instant. The Asura King and the other Asura World Spirits were confused, unable to comprehend what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time, elders,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Asura King and the others saw Chu Feng, and they noticed that he didn&rsquo;t look surprised by the turn of events at all. This made them realize that he knew what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Paying respect to Lord Chu Feng,&rdquo; the Asura King first kneeled down with his army to pay respect to Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Spare with the ceremony,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he stepped across the door to support the Asura King up to his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, do you know what&rsquo;s going on with our cultivation?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s related to this door,&rdquo; Chu Feng said before explaining the situation to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng&hellip; is this really not a dream? Did our cultivation really grow by so much?&rdquo; the Asura World Spirits nervously asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course, this is all real. Your cultivation won&rsquo;t regress anymore,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Asura World Spirit Army was overjoyed to hear that. It was not just the Asura King, </span><span>Yunliang</span><span>, </span><span>Xiangji</span><span>, and the others who had enjoyed an increase in their cultivation but all of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, most of the Asura World Spirits were at Martial Exalted level. A million of them were at pinnacle Martial Exalted level, and only ten thousand had reached Half-God level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the recent breakthrough from the release of the gate&rsquo;s second and third seal had boosted millions of them up to Half-God level. Even the weakest of them was at pinnacle Martial Exalted level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were now much stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng,&rdquo; Lord </span><span>Xiangji</span><span> suddenly kneeled down before Chu Feng with tears of regret. The crowd was perplexed by his actions till he spoke up, &ldquo;I have cultivated for so many years, only to raise my cultivation from rank three Half-God level to rank six. Yet, within a year of following Lord Chu Feng, my cultivation was bumped up to rank eight Half-God level. How could I have been so foolish as to doubt Lord Chu Feng before? I deserve to die!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other Asura World Spirits also kneeled down in guilt after hearing those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of them had been opposed to following Chu Feng back then, as they had to </span><span>contract with him and suffer a decline in their cultivation. If not for the Asura King taking the lead, a lot of them would have turned down the offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, Chu Feng was too weak to win their trust back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only now that they realized what kind of incredible potential Chu Feng harnessed. If not for the Asura King and Lord </span><span>Yunliang&rsquo;s</span><span> wisdom, they would have missed this opportunity of their lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elders, please get up,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the kneeling Asura World Spirits refused to get up. They were ashamed of themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you disregarding my orders right now?&rdquo; Chu Feng frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Asura World Spirits quickly rose to their feet and explained, &ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, we have no such intention. We are just&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng knew what they wanted to say. He waved his hand to gesture for them not to explain and said, &ldquo;Many of you were stronger than me when we sealed the contract, but you were still willing to serve me. I remember the trust you have put in me. I told you back then I&rsquo;ll help you regain your cultivation and go further than that. I&rsquo;m only doing what I have promised.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, Lord Chu Feng said that he&rsquo;ll help us regain our cultivation within a hundred years, but it has only been a year and we have already surpassed our previous height. We&rsquo;re humbled,&rdquo; </span><span>Yunliang</span><span> said with a chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Long live Lord Chu Feng!&rdquo; The other Asura World Spirits cheered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You need not thank me. I did not do much. The true credit lies with the Heavenly King of Massacre,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he glanced at the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gate was both a treasure and a part of God&rsquo;s Contract with the Asura World Spirit Army. Chu Feng had a feeling that the Asura World Spirit Army had previously failed to make much progress in their cultivation because their progress had been devoured by God&rsquo;s Contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were just getting the results of their cultivation back now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng had no idea why the Heavenly King of Massacre did that, but in any case, he had benefited from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Asura World Spirit Army also fell silent looking at the gate. How could they forget their past master, the Heavenly King of Massacre?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Regardless, Lord Chu Feng, my cultivation rose after I came to serve you. You&rsquo;re the one I am grateful to,&rdquo; </span><span>Xiangji</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other Asura World Spirits also expressed a similar stance. They were in a high mood due to the rise in their cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, the Asura King asked, &ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, is there still a limit to how many times you can summon us?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There is still a limit, but I&rsquo;d only know the exact details after I summon you. There&rsquo;s a silver lining though. While I won&rsquo;t be able to tap into your strength when the gate closes once more, that&rsquo;d be a chance for me to raise your cultivation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re saying that our cultivation will be further raised the next time you unseal the gate?&rdquo; the Asura King asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, but it won&rsquo;t be that easy. I unsealed three seals this time around, but I </span><span>have a feeling the fourth one won&rsquo;t be as easy. I&rsquo;ll need some time to comprehend it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that mean there&rsquo;s no limit to how far we can raise our cultivation as long as Lord Chu Feng is around?&rdquo; the Asura World Spirit Army asked in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s bound to be a limit to how far the formation can raise your cultivation, but please be assured that you won&rsquo;t be limited by that. As long as I&rsquo;m around, I&rsquo;ll make sure that there&rsquo;s no ceiling to your cultivation,&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke with absolute confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Long live Lord Chu Feng! May Lord Chu Feng live for ten thousand years!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Asura World Spirit Army threw their hands into the sky, showing no doubt for Chu Feng&rsquo;s words at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense. There&rsquo;s no way Lord Chu Feng would only live for ten thousand years. His lifespan will be as long as the world itself,&rdquo; the Asura King corrected them with a smile. He was as excited as the other Asura World Spirits too, though he </span><span>wasn</span><span>&rsquo;t visibly showing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was certain that his decision to follow Chu Feng back then was the right one now.</span></p></div>
