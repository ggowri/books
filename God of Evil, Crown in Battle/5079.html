        <h1>Chapter 5078</h1>
        <div>: I&rsquo;ll Be Going Ahead<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many of the Asura Evil Spirits shared the same sentiments as the Asura King. Their previous master was the<br>of Massacre, an expert who dominated the vast world of cultivation tens of thousands of years ago.<br>On the other hand, Chu Feng was a mere Martial Exalted level cultivator. Putting aside the Asura King, even a random guard present could have easily defeated Chu Feng. How could someone this weak be worthy to lead them?<br>Even Lord Yunliang could sense great pressure from the crowd. It was as if millions of ferocious lions were eyeing a small cub. Little had to be said about what Chu Feng was facing right now.<br>Afraid that Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t be able to withstand the pressure, Lord Yunliang stepped in and said, &ldquo;Everyone, this is&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Yunliang,&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly interjected.<br>He knew that Lord Yunliang was speaking up on his behalf, but he thought that it would be best for him to resolve this issue by himself. Lord Yunliang looked at Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze and understood his intention right away, so he decided not to say anything.<br>&ldquo;I understand your skepticism. I would have felt the same way if I was in your place. I am a mere rank four Martial Exalted level cultivator and a rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist. It wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if you deemed me to be unworthy.<br>&ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s also a fact that I have cleared the trial left behind by the<br>of Massacre. This should be more than enough to prove my qualification. Even if you don&rsquo;t trust my words, surely you should trust the<br>of Massacre.&rdquo;<br>Shoosh!<br>Chu Feng formed a series of hand seals.<br>Weng!<br>A massive contract formation appeared before him. It was amazingly powerful, far superior to any other contract formations out there.<br>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s Contract?&rdquo;<br>Conflicted looks appeared on the faces of the Asura Evil Spirits. They could tell that this was the means of the<br>of Massacre. In fact, it was through this same contract formation that they had become the latter&rsquo;s world spirits.<br>It was just that they were later abandoned by the<br>of Massacre.<br>They had been anticipating this contract formation for so long, but now that it was right in front of them, they couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a little hesitant.<br>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the real God&rsquo;s Contract but a reward bestowed upon me by the<br>of Massacre for clearing his trial. Through this, you&rsquo;ll be able to establish a contract with me and become my world spirit. I can bring you out of the Asura Graveyard,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;I, Yunliang, am willing to establish a contract with Lord Chu Feng!&rdquo; Lord Yunliang declared before walking over to the contract formation.<br>Many of the other Asura Evil Spirits were also moved by the proposal. While they had little confidence in Chu Feng, it had been their long-time wish to escape from the Asura Graveyard. Regardless of how powerful Chu Feng was at the moment, he was still a world spiritist who had been acknowledged by the<br>of Massacre.<br>Choosing Chu Feng was a testament to their loyalty to the<br>of Massacre.<br>&ldquo;Lord Yunliang, wait a moment. Please allow me to finish my words first.&rdquo;<br>Surprisingly, Chu Feng stopped Lord Yunliang before the latter could step into the contract formation. He turned to the millions of Asura Evil Spirits present.<br>&ldquo;This God&rsquo;s Contract was left behind by the<br>of Massacre, and it has the power to turn you back into world spirits. However, your cultivation will regress if you choose to establish a contract with me, though I&rsquo;m not too sure to what extent,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Those words spurred chaos amidst the Asura World Spirit Army.<br>The fact that their cultivation would regress meant that they would become weak.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, my name is Xiang Ji. My current cultivation is rank six Half-God level. May I know how far will my cultivation regress if I establish a contract with you?&rdquo; one of the elders amidst the Asura World Spirit Army asked.<br>Chu Feng had met Xiang Ji before, and he was one of the high-ranking individuals in the Asura World Spirit Army. It was just that he didn&rsquo;t expect the latter to actually be at rank six Half-God level. If he was this strong, exactly how powerful was the Asura King?<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say for sure,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied honestly.<br>He knew that their cultivation would regress, but he didn&rsquo;t know the extent of it.<br>Xiang Ji frowned upon hearing those words. He wasn&rsquo;t too happy with Chu Feng&rsquo;s reply.<br>&ldquo;Your cultivation will regress to rank three Half-God level,&rdquo; the Asura King suddenly spoke up.<br>&ldquo;Milord, you know about this?&rdquo; Xiang Ji immediately turned to the Asura King and asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my guess. Your cultivation was at rank three Half-God level back when we were first abandoned by Lord Massacre. You were able to advance your cultivation to rank six Half-God level during the many years we have spent here, but it was relying on the energy Lord Massacre left to sustain our life force that you managed to do so.<br>&ldquo;If our cultivation is going to regress, it&rsquo;s likely to be Lord Massacre&rsquo;s doing. My guess is that he would wish for us to return to our original cultivation level,&rdquo; the Asura King said.<br>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;<br>Xiang Ji's frown deepened.<br>He had spent tens of thousands of years to advance his cultivation from rank three Half-God level to rank six. It was hard for him to accept having his tens of thousands of years of hard work unraveled in an instant.<br>Many of the other Asura Evil Spirits felt the same way too.<br>The Heavenly Lord of Massacre had left behind a bundle of powerful energy for them back when he left them in the Asura Graveyard. It was thanks to that energy that they were able to survive the past tens of thousands of years. At the same time, they also used that energy to further their cultivation.<br>Their rate of cultivation was slow, but they managed to make significant progress over the past tens of thousands of years. They wouldn&rsquo;t want to lose it all just like that.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Asura King suddenly burst into laughter. He turned to Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Is there anything else you want to say?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your cultivation might regress, but under the effects of God&rsquo;s Contract, I&rsquo;ll benefit from establishing contracts with you, depending on the total number of contractees and your respective cultivation levels,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What kind of benefit is it?&rdquo; the Asura King asked.<br>&ldquo;Simply put, my cultivation level will rise,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;In other words, we&rsquo;re giving away our tens of thousands of years of cultivation to you?&rdquo;<br>Another uproar broke out in the Asura World Spirit Army. How could they be willing to give away their cultivation to another person just like that?<br>In comparison, the Asura King was much calmer. He looked at Chu Feng without any change in his expression.<br>&ldquo;How strong will you become?&rdquo; the Asura King asked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be much. Excessive growth is detrimental in the path of martial cultivation,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Why are you telling us now? Shouldn&rsquo;t you reveal it only after we establish contracts with you? You might be weak right now, but you have indeed cleared Lord Massacre&rsquo;s trial. As much as we look down on you, some of us would still choose to contract with you out of loyalty to Lord Massacre. What you&rsquo;re saying right now will make many of us hesitate,&rdquo; the Asura King said.<br>&ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;m also worried that none of you are willing to contract with me. I can frankly tell you that I need your strength and help right now, and that&rsquo;s also the reason why I have come here. However, I don&rsquo;t want to withhold information from you. I want you to be able to make this decision knowing the consequences so that you won&rsquo;t regret it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>The Asura King nodded. He turned to the Asura World Spirit Army behind him and asked, &ldquo;Are the rest of you still hesitating?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, we&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Asura Evil Spirits were indeed unable to make up their minds. They were already used to being in the Asura Graveyard, and it was only a streak of tenacity in them that made them crave freedom. They didn&rsquo;t think that it would be worth it if the price of leaving this place was to acknowledge a far weaker person as their master and have their cultivation stolen from them,<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll be going ahead,&rdquo; the Asura King said.<br>He began making his way toward the contract formation.<br></p></div>
