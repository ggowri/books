        <div> - The Wronged Chu Feng<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, only you can help me.&rdquo;<br>As Fumo Xin&rsquo;er spoke to Chu Feng, her large watery eyes were fixed on him.<br>That gaze of hers was filled with tender affection, enough to make one feel distressed.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xin&rsquo;er can rest assured. I will give my all to treat you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Take this medicinal pellet first.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng took out a detoxifying medicinal pellet and handed it to Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>While it would not be able to remove the poison in her, it would be able to retard the spread of the poison.<br>Even if there was nothing he could do, Chu Feng still had to try his best to save Fumo Xin&rsquo;er. No matter what, he couldn&rsquo;t possibly just watch as she died.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s useless. That won&rsquo;t be able to help me. Only you will be able to help me,&rdquo; As Fumo Xin&rsquo;er spoke, she actually lowered her head in an embarrassed manner.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng thought that she was feeling afraid of death. Because of that, he thought about comforting her.<br>But, before he could say anything, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s body moved. She actually leaped into Chu Feng&rsquo;s embrace.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xin&rsquo;er, what are you doing?&rdquo;<br>The sudden action caught Chu Feng of guard.<br>In a panic, Chu Feng not only pushed Fumo Xin&rsquo;er away, but he even moved back to avoid her.<br>He looked back to her and grew even more puzzled.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was clearly poisoned. Yet she didn't behave like someone that had been poisoned.<br>Instead, her face was flushed red. She looked even more womanly.<br>Most importantly, why had Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s attitude become so strange?<br>Could it have been caused by that poison?<br>At that moment, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er looked at Chu Feng with a surprised look.<br>After being momentarily stunned, she finally spoke. &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, please don&rsquo;t misunderstand. I, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er am not a casual woman.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that I am poisoned. Because of that, there&rsquo;s no alternative.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Western Ghost Wasps possess two types of poisons.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The poison from their stingers is certain death. It cannot be treated.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if one is bitten by them, there is a way to treat the poison.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, the treatment is that one must have sex before the poison activates.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, once my poison erupts I will die.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, there&rsquo;s only you and I here. If I want to treat this poison, I can only seek out your help,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually that sort of poison?&rdquo; Chu Feng was very shocked.<br>Chu Feng knew of such poisons.<br>In fact, he had also seen this sort of poison before. Merely, this sort of poison was usually man-made.<br>He'd never imagined that there would be a species of creatures that naturally created this sort of poison.<br>It was the first time he had heard of such a thing.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, are you planning to let me die?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Or could it be that you think that I&rsquo;m unbefitting of you?&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s wide-open eyes were filled with disbelief.<br>Evidently, she had not anticipated that Chu Feng would respond with such resistance.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it. With how outstanding Miss Xin&rsquo;er is how could you be unbefitting?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that sex is something that should be done between a married couple,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;In that case, I am willing to marry you,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t finish his words. He felt that the situation had become complicated.<br>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; asked Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xin&rsquo;er, please excuse my rudeness. Whilst you are as beautiful as a celestial fairy, I&hellip; do not have feelings for you. As such, it&rsquo;s impossible for me to do that sort of thing with you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er became evidently angry after hearing those words.<br>After all, a girl of her beauty would generally be surrounded by men.<br>Furthermore, they would be outstanding men too. But no matter how outstanding they were, none of them had been able to enter her eyes.<br>She had thrown herself into Chu Feng&rsquo;s arms of her own accord, yet Chu Feng had reacted with such unwillingness. This was a major hit to her aloof ego.<br>However, no matter how furious she was there was nothing she could do.<br>After all, this was a matter concerning life and death.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, this is a life and death matter. Even if you are to refuse to take responsibility, I will not blame you for it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I can keep what happens here confidential. I will not mention this to anyone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as you also agree to keep things confidential, wouldn&rsquo;t it be fine?&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er said with a reddened face.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xin&rsquo;er, is there really no other alternative besides that?&rdquo; Chu Feng was still unwilling.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing how resistant Chu Feng was even at that moment, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er became so furious that she started to stomp her feet.<br>Unable to persuade Chu Feng, she said, &ldquo;Whilst there is another method it&rsquo;s simply too dangerous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What method is it? Tell me,&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly said.<br>&ldquo;There are actually two ways to remove the poison. The first method is what I told you about.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the second, it would be to proceed for the Western Ghost Wasps&rsquo; hive and search for the source of the poison. Perhaps one could find the antidote there.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, that method is too dangerous. It would be one thing if the Western Ghost Wasps weren&rsquo;t in their nest. However, if they are, one would simply not be able to retrieve their poison&rsquo;s source, and would instead die there,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still worth a try. Miss Xin&rsquo;er, do you know where their nest is?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be able to find the nest by following this compass,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er said as she grabbed the compass in her hand.<br>Then, following the compass, Chu Feng and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er found the Western Ghost Wasps&rsquo; hive.<br>Most fortunately of all, there was not a single Western Ghost Wasp in the enormous hive.<br>Chu Feng managed to find the wasp poison without any issue. Furthermore, through the wasp poison, he managed to make an antidote.<br>Once Fumo Xin&rsquo;er took the antidote, the poison in her body began to disappear rapidly.<br>After the poison was removed, Chu Feng and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er continued on with their journey.<br>Through the guidance of the compass, they finally passed through the spirit formation and left the sealed territory.<br>However, after passing through the spirit formation, Chu Feng turned around and discovered that he could not see the spirit formation at all.<br>Even the impression of the surroundings had turned into a completely new world.<br>Even when he used his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, Chu Feng was unable to find the spirit formation.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that he had just come out of the sealed territory, even he would question whether or not the sealed territory existed.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xin&rsquo;er, how are we going to return to the sealed territory?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I naturally have a way,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Then Miss Xin&rsquo;er, please lead the way.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er began to guide Chu Feng.<br>However, Chu Feng discovered an issue. Even though Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was guiding him the entire time, her enthusiastic attitude from before had changed and she had grown cold.<br>Even when giving directions she only used her fingers, and did not say anything to him.<br>This was completely different from her enthusiastic behavior earlier.<br>This change began the moment Chu Feng had helped treat her poison.<br>Chu Feng was no fool. He naturally knew the reason for Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s change in attitude.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xin&rsquo;er, I am thinking for your good. You shouldn&rsquo;t be angry with me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now that the poison has been removed and you were able to keep yourself from having to do that sort of thing, keep yourself from being taken advantage of by me, isn&rsquo;t that much better?&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>Suddenly, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er erupted in anger. &ldquo;How could I not be angry when you refused to take advantage of me when the opportunity presented itself?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that you have the same sort of asthetics as my grandma?! Could I also be an ugly person in your eyes?!&rdquo;<br>She who had been very gentle earlier was actually shouting at Chu Feng.<br>Especially her eyes, they were so fierce that they seemed like they wanted to eat Chu Feng alive.<br>&ldquo;I swear to heaven, earth and my conscience, there is nothing wrong with my asthetics.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Miss Xin&rsquo;er, you are truly very beautiful. It would not be excessive to say that your beauty is like that of a celestial fairy,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Then why did you refuse me?&rdquo; asked Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I refused you. It&rsquo;s simply that I don&rsquo;t have feelings for you. It&rsquo;s not something that I can explain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t possibly do that sort of thing to you without having any feelings for you. If that were the case, I would be being too irresponsible. I Chu Feng, am not that sort of person,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; you should just shut up. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that I need your help to save my big brother, I&rsquo;d truly want to slap you to death!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re simply killing me with anger!&rdquo;<br>As Fumo Xin&rsquo;er spoke, she not only seethed with anger, but her face had also turned purple.<br>Chu Feng could tell that Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was truly angry.<br>However, she could not blame him. After all, it was a matter concerning reputation and integrity.<br>Chu Feng was a man; what could he possibly fear?<br>That was a great opportunity to take advantage of her.<br>The reason why he had refused to do so was truly because he was being considerate of her.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xin&rsquo;er, you&rsquo;re still young. Perhaps there are still some things you don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, in the future, you will come to a realization.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;One day, you will realize the thought and consideration I&rsquo;ve put into making that decision,&rdquo; Chu Feng sighed helplessly.<br>&ldquo;Pah! Stop talking and just shut up! Else I&rsquo;ll slap you to death right now!&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er shouted furiously.<br>Her voice echoed like rolling thunder, and echoed clearly for millions of meters.<br>&ldquo;I was wrong. I&rsquo;ll shut up.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng immediately shut his mouth. He no longer dared to continue to provoke Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>He felt that if he were to continue, she would really do something to him.<br>That said, Chu Feng felt extremely wronged. He had clearly done nothing wrong.<br></p></div>
