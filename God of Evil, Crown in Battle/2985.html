        <div> - Queen Vs. Chu Qing<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come to challenge me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a challenge. It&rsquo;s merely a spar. To be exact, I wish to spar with that young lady inside your world spirit space. However, since she is your friend, the one that would be sparring against me would be you,&rdquo; Chu Qing said with a smile on his face.<br>Even though he had come to challenge Chu Feng, he still behaved very courteously, and even somewhat humbly.<br>&ldquo;I must ask her about this,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Chu Qing nodded.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to bother asking, this Queen will play with him,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said to Chu Feng before he could ask her.<br>&ldquo;My dear Eggy, that Chu Qing is not a simple character. Even I am unable to tell if he&rsquo;s still a True Immortal,&rdquo; Chu Feng urged against it. He did not wish for Her Lady Queen to fight against Chu Qing.<br>As Chu Feng was unable to determine how powerful Chu Qing was, he was afraid that Her Lady Queen would be in danger.<br>&ldquo;It doesn't matter. Even if I am to lose, it wouldn&rsquo;t do anything. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ll lose my flesh or limbs.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, should I win, the title of the number one genius in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm will become yours,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng knew that Her Lady Queen wanted to accept the challenge for his sake. However, the more it was this way, the more unwilling Chu Feng became. He didn&rsquo;t want Eggy to fight for his sake.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no buts. Quickly, let this Queen out. Stop acting so overly sensitive. This Queen has not exercised properly for a long time now. Today, I will properly reveal my capabilities,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>With the situation being like that, Chu Feng would not be able to change Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s mind. Thus, he ended up opening his World Spirit Gate.<br>After the World Spirit Gate opened, Her Lady Queen immediately walked out from it and began to size Chu Qing up. With a provocative tone, she said, &ldquo;The number one genius of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s younger generations is not up to much.&rdquo;<br>Faced with Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s provocation, Chu Qing only smiled in a good-natured manner. He said, &ldquo;I am Chu Qing. It is my pleasure to meet you, young lady.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tsk, don&rsquo;t think that this Queen will be lenient on you just because you&rsquo;re acting friendly. You need to prepare yourself to be beaten half-dead fighting this Queen,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen did not appreciate Chu Qing&rsquo;s courtesy at all.<br>&ldquo;It is inevitable for one to be injured in a spar. If young lady is to injure me, I will definitely not complain at all. However&hellip; I will definitely not injure you. Otherwise&hellip;&rdquo; After saying those words, Chu Qing looked to Chu Feng. With a smile on his face, he said, &ldquo;... I&rsquo;m afraid little brother Chu Feng will try to kill me.&rdquo;<br>Chu Qing&rsquo;s words possessed a hidden implication.<br>It seemed that he had come prepared. He even knew that the relationship between Chu Feng and Her Lady Queen was extraordinary. No wonder he addressed Her Lady Queen as &lsquo;young lady&rsquo; from the very start, and not &lsquo;world spirit.&rsquo;<br>He was being respectful toward Her Lady Queen, and respectful toward Chu Feng.<br>Of course, this also revealed Chu Qing&rsquo;s character.<br>He was very unpretentious, and also cared greatly about Chu Feng&rsquo;s feelings. As the strongest person of the younger generation in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm at the moment, it was truly hard to believe that he would act in such a manner.<br>However, Her Lady Queen evidently did not care about Chu Qing&rsquo;s courteous behavior.<br>That was understandable too. Apart from Chu Feng and some women that she was fond of, Her Lady Queen had never revealed her gentle side to anyone else.<br>&ldquo;Enough of the superfluous words. If you want to spar, let us begin immediately,&rdquo; as Her Lady Queen spoke, she began to walk outside.<br>She knew very well that, with the strength that she and Chu Qing possessed, the room would definitely not have sufficient space for them to fight.<br>Not to mention the room, the entire palace hall would likely be destroyed completely by their power.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to go out. It would do for us to spar here.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Qing spoke, he raised his arm, and a body of light blossomed from his hand.<br>When that body of light blossomed, it covered the entire surrounding area.<br>When that body of light dissipated, Chu Feng was surprised to discover that the three of them were no longer inside the room. Instead, they were in a vast and boundless starry sky.<br>What Chu Qing had used was a treasure, a treasure containing an isolated space.<br>Chu Feng and the others had not left the room. Instead, they had entered that treasure&rsquo;s isolated space.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Qing snapped his fingers. Immediately, a body of light appeared beside Chu Feng.<br>That body of light was no small matter. It was simply an indestructible defensive formation.<br>At the very least, it was a defensive formation so powerful that the current Chu Feng would not be able to destroy it even if he were to go all-out attacking it.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re capable of controlling this space?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>The reason why Chu Feng asked this question was because he was worried that Chu Qing was capable of controlling the space to gain a certain level of power over others present. Should that be the case, the match between him and Her Lady Queen would be extremely unfair.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, please rest assured. I will absolutely not use any other external power. Instead, I will rely on my own strength to spar against that friend of yours,&rdquo; Chu Qing said.<br>&ldquo;Rooarr~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Her Lady Queen unleashed her attack. Dark black gaseous flames were unleashed by Her Lady Queen. Like a magnificent army of thousands of men and horses, they began to charge at Chu Qing.<br>Her Lady Queen unleashed her heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation from the very start. She was truly showing Chu Qing no quarter.<br>However, Chu Qing&rsquo;s perception was extremely powerful. At the moment when Her Lady Queen unleashed her attack, Chu Qing immediately flung his sleeve and sent forth ten bodies of martial power.<br>It was an Immortal Technique. Chu Qing&rsquo;s Immortal Technique was very strange. When the ten bodies of martial power appeared, they immediately turned into ten enormous mountains that stood before Chu Qing.<br>Although the mountains were incapable of stopping Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s attack, they managed to successfully slow her attack. As such, it could be said that they had obstructed Her Lady Queen.<br>At the same time as the ten mountains were hindering Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s attack, light appeared under Chu Qing&rsquo;s feet. Chu Qing&rsquo;s body started to rapidly move backwards. His speed was simply too fast. Even when trying his hardest, Chu Feng was only barely able to see Chu Qing and the light under his feet.<br>It was also an Immortal Technique. It was a sort of Immortal Technique that increased one&rsquo;s speed.<br>&ldquo;Rank nine True Immortal?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed. Regardless of how well Chu Qing had concealed himself, Chu Feng was still capable of sensing his cultivation the moment he unleashed his defense.<br>Rank nine True Immortal, that was Chu Qing&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>As Chu Qing was moving back explosively, light started to fill the dark starry sky.<br>Lightning was scattering about in all directions. Like a sea of lightning, they soon filled the entire sky.<br>At the same time, a Lightning Mark appeared on Chu Qing&rsquo;s forehead.<br>It was a Heaven level Lightning Mark. Chu Qing had also trained in the Heavenly Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>Chu Qing was already a rank nine True Immortal, an actual peak True Immortal, someone only a thin line away from becoming a Heavenly Immortal.<br>However, there was an irreversible element between the True Immortal realm and the Heavenly Immortal realm. Thus, even though Chu Qing had unleashed his Heaven level Lightning Mark that was capable of increasing his cultivation, his cultivation remained that of a rank nine True Immortal. He did not manage to break through to rank one Heavenly Immortal.<br>That said, even though he didn&rsquo;t manage to increase his cultivation to that of a Heavenly Immortal, he still benefited from using his Heaven level Lightning Mark.<br>Chu Qing had gained heaven-defying battle power. Although Chu Qing&rsquo;s heaven-defying battle power was only capable of surmounting one level of cultivation, his current strength was not at all weaker than Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s rank five True Immortal cultivation and heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation.<br>Furthermore, a silver spear also appeared in Chu Qing&rsquo;s hand.<br>That was an Incomplete Immortal Armament. Furthermore, it was a top quality Incomplete Immortal Armament.<br>With that Incomplete Immortal Armament in hand, Chu Qing&rsquo;s battle power increased once again.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, I am going to attack now,&rdquo; after Chu Qing said these words, his body shifted. The spear in his hand started flying toward Her Lady Queen.<br>As Her Lady Queen was attacking Chu Qing to begin with, and Chu Qing&rsquo;s speed was extremely fast, the moment he changed directions and rushed toward Her Lady Queen, he collided with Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s black gaseous flames in the blink of an eye.<br>Even though Chu Qing was facing Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s dark black gaseous flames that resembled a magnificent army of thousands of men and horses, the dark black gaseous flames that covered the sky and earth, he remained completely composed, and showed no sign of fear.<br>As Chu Qing brandished the spear in his hand, a silver dragon appeared around him.<br>The silver dragon swung itself. Everything in its path was swept away. Chu Qing seemed to be completely unstoppable.<br>At that moment, the black flames were dispersed. Chu Qing actually managed to open a path for himself within the black flames. He was rushing straight for Her Lady Queen.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng involuntarily started clenching his fists. He was frowning.<br>This was the first time Chu Feng had been worried for Her Lady Queen when she fought against someone with the same strength as herself.<br>That Chu Qing was truly powerful!!!<br><br><br></p></div>
