        <h1>Chapter 3585</h1>
        <div> - The Tyrannic Chu Feng<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, Lord Zhengfa, seniors, I, Chu Feng, am fine. I&rsquo;ve made you all worried,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Good, good, good. It&rsquo;s great that young friend Chu Feng is still alive.&rdquo;<br>On the stone chair, Tantai Yinjian let out a joyous voice.<br>&ldquo;Elder Tantai, do you really think that it&rsquo;s a good thing that I&rsquo;m still alive?&rdquo; Chu Feng raised his head to look to Tantai Yinjian. The expression on his face was not amiable at all.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, what are you talking about? It's all thanks to you that we were able to reach this place. If it wasn&rsquo;t for you, we would&rsquo;ve likely died already. What you&rsquo;ve done for us is deeply engraved in our memories. We would naturally hope for nothing to have happened to you,&rdquo; said Tantai Yinjian.<br>&ldquo;However, if I, Chu Feng, am alive, what your clansmen did to my clansmen absolutely cannot be settled like this,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing Chu Feng, the crowd, including Tantai Yinjian, revealed a change in expression.<br>They were all able to tell that Chu Feng was not as easy to handle as the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Likely, he was really planning to obtain justice for his clansmen.<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he walked over to the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen and pointed to five individuals.<br>&ldquo;You, you, you, you and you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The five of you, stand forth, &rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, the five Tantai Heavenly Clansmen raised their heads to look to Tantai Yinjian. They only stood after Tantai Yinjian nodded.<br>&ldquo;The five of you killed my clansmen, do you admit to it or not?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the five Tantai Heavenly Clansmen turned ashen. They did not know how Chu Feng learned that it was the five of them that had killed the Chu Heavenly Clansmen. After all, none of them had ever admitted it to anyone.<br>Furthermore, with how chaotic the situation was previously, it was likely that not even the people present would know it was them.<br>As for Chu Feng, he wasn&rsquo;t even present earlier. Thus, how could he determine that it was them so accurately?<br>&ldquo;As men, are you people that do not dare to admit to what you&rsquo;ve done?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked coldly.<br>&ldquo;Right, I killed them.&rdquo;<br>One of the five, for some unknown reason, actually admitted to it. Furthermore, he stuck out his chest as he said those words. It was as if what he did was not wrong, but rather an amazing feat instead.<br>&ldquo;I did it.&rdquo;<br>Following the first person, the remaining four people also admitted to it in succession.<br>All five of them were very confident. They were completely different from their previous ashamed and repentance-filled appearances.<br>It was understandable. After all, they were merely putting on a show earlier.<br>They knew in their hearts that the Chu Heavenly Clan simply did not dare to do anything to them.<br>Since Chu Feng was insistent on having them admit to their actions, they&rsquo;d decided to admit to it, and see what exactly Chu Feng could do about it.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>Then, a trace of ruthlessness flashed through Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng waved his arm and sent forth his martial power.<br>With five muffled bangs, the five Tantai Heavenly Clansmen all exploded!!!<br>The five of them were all killed by Chu Feng!!!<br>Seeing that, many people opened their mouths wide with astonishment.<br>None of the people present, including Tantai Yinjian, had anticipated that Chu Feng would be so daring as to actually kill the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how dare you&hellip; eeahhh!!!&rdquo;<br>A Tantai Heavenly Clansman immediately lashed out at Chu Feng. However, before he could finish his words, he immediately started to scream in pain.<br>He was not only the person that lashed out at Chu Feng.<br>The Tantai Heavenly Clansmen that were previously kneeling and who had admitted to seriously injuring the Chu Heavenly Clansmen all fell to the ground with looks of pain on their faces. They were grabbing their dantians and howling in grief as they rolled around in pain.<br>All of their dantians had been pierced through. Their cultivations... had all been crippled!!<br>It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng was the one that had destroyed their dantians.<br>&ldquo;While death can be spared, you all cannot be pardoned.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was completely cold and without any feelings as he said those words. The coldness of his face brought fear to the crowd after they saw it.<br>Ruthless. Extremely ruthless.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s ruthlessness was not only seen by his ruthless actions.<br>His ruthlessness was present in how he dared to challenge a greater power, dared to act ruthlessly against the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen.<br>&ldquo;Impudent! You dare kill our clansmen?! Chu Feng, have you grown tired of living?!&rdquo;<br>Many Tantai Heavenly Clan elders stood forth angrily. They looked like they were planning to devour Chu Feng.<br>Sure enough, their behavior earlier was merely a pretense. When their clansmen were truly punished, they revealed their ugly features.<br>&ldquo;A life for a life, why wouldn&rsquo;t I dare?&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke with contempt.<br>&ldquo;Arrogant brat, do you think our Tantai Heavenly Clan to be a pushover?! If we don&rsquo;t teach you a lesson today, you will not know the immensity of heaven and earth!&rdquo;<br>As that Tantai Heavenly Clan elder spoke, he released his martial power to attack Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, even though he sent his martial power to attack Chu Feng, Chu Feng was completely unscathed. Instead, it was him who was sent flying. When he landed, he was seriously injured.<br>It was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>It was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief who had beaten back that Tantai Heavenly Clan elder.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? You&rsquo;re not satisfied with killing our Chu Heavenly Clansmen, and now want to kill our clan&rsquo;s genius, kill the benefactor that saved your lives?!&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked with a stern voice.<br>Not only did he have a furious look on his face, but his eyes were also filled with killing intent.<br>He looked completely different from before.<br>Earlier, he had a very difficult expression on his face. Everyone knew that he would not really do anything to the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen.<br>However, at that moment, he had a fierce look on his face. If one was to provoke the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief at that moment, they would likely end up dying.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing such a fierce and determined Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the Tantai Heavenly Clan elders that were lashing out at Chu Feng earlier no longer dared to act rashly. They all turned their eyes to Tantai Yinjian.<br>However, they discovered that Tantai Yinjian had closed his eyes. He appeared as if he was no longer going to meddle in the matter.<br>This brought great panic to the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen. If even their Supreme Elder was not planning to do anything, who would save them?<br>Although they felt very unreconciled, they no longer dared to act impudently.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Clan Chief,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist respectfully to express his thanks.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it seems like you know all the people that attacked our clansmen. Bring them all out here. Be at complete ease, with this old man here, no one will be able to do anything to you.&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was not joking around. He had indeed thought about compromising earlier. However, after Chu Feng had killed those five Tantai Heavenly Clansmen, he had changed his mind.<br>While he could abandon anyone else, he could not abandon Chu Feng. Chu Feng was the hope of their Chu Heavenly Clan. Even if he was to sacrifice himself, he had to keep Chu Feng safe.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Lord Clan Chief,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist again. Then, he swept his cold gaze across the crowd.<br></p></div>
