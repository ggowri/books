        <h1>Chapter 4754</h1>
        <div>: Chu Feng Makes a Move<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo;<br>Thinking nothing of the matter, Zuoqiu Yanliang harrumphed coldly, and a Lightning Mark immediately formed on his forehead, causing his cultivation to rise to rank four Martial Exalted level.<br>At the same time, he formed a series of hand seals and synchronized the auras of the three Hidden Dragon Swords to match his own.<br>Wu!<br>However, as the auras of the Hidden Dragon Swords grew stronger, Li Muzhi and Song Qian immediately revealed pained expressions. This was especially so for Li Muzhi, whose face had turned pale. Blood was flowing out from his nose and ears.<br>It was obvious that the strength infused within the Hidden Dragon Sword was already beyond what he could control. It was inflicting damage on him, but he chose to bear with it. After all, their survival was at stake here.<br>&ldquo;Stop attacking it. If you infuriate it, none of us will be getting out of here alive!&rdquo; Chu Feng reminded upon seeing that Zuoqiu Yanliang was unwilling to give up.<br>&ldquo;Cut the crap. Who do you think you are? How dare a despicable scum who snuck into here dare to criticize me? Just wait till I&rsquo;m done with the Hellking, and you&rsquo;ll be next!&rdquo;<br>Instead of heeding Chu Feng&rsquo;s advice, Zuoqiu Yanliang replied with a malicious sneer. He quickly channeled the Hidden Dragon Swords to launch yet another strike down on the Tiger Serpent.<br>His attack was much stronger this time around, stirring powerful shockwaves upon striking down on the humongous beast. Even the surrounding disciples were sent flying from the force of those shockwaves.<br>As a result, the supporting formation maintained by the Duanmu Brothers and the other personal disciples fell apart, and many of them sustained severe injuries.<br>However, it wasn&rsquo;t just the personal disciples who had sustained injuries. Li Muzhi also began bleeding from his seven apertures due to his inability to endure the strength of the Hidden Dragon Sword, causing his body to slump down.<br>At the same time, the Hidden Dragon Sword he controlled shrank back to its original size and fell to the ground.<br>With this, there were only two Hidden Dragon Swords left.<br>However, to the crowd&rsquo;s astonishment, the other two Hidden Dragon Swords also soon reverted back to their original size. When they took a closer look, they were appalled to see that Song Qian and Zuoqiu Yanliang had sustained severe injuries too.<br>This was especially so for Zuoqiu Yanliang, who sat in a slump on the beast he was controlling. The Lightning Mark on his forehead had disappeared without a trace. He looked to be in an even weaker state than Li Muzhi.<br>As the one leading the Hidden Dragon Sword Formation, he ended up paying a heavy price from the rebound of his failed attack.<br>&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo;<br>The disciples began panicking. That earlier attack was definitely the strongest one they got, but the Tiger Serpent still remained completely unharmed. Not only so, but its body had also begun wiggling once more to form its fourth head.<br>It didn&rsquo;t take long for the fourth head to finish forming, and its aura immediately soared to rank five Martial Exalted level!<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re doomed, doomed!&rdquo;<br>Seeing how the Tiger Serpent had grown stronger yet again, the disciples fell into despair. As Zuoqiu Youyu didn&rsquo;t participate in the hunt, the strongest one amongst them at the moment was no other than Zuoqiu Yanliang.<br>They knew that Zuoqiu Yanliang could only raise his cultivation up to rank four Martial Exalted level with his Lightning Mark, so there was no way he could possibly hope to defeat the rank five Martial Exalted level Tiger Serpent.<br>A rank of difference in Martial Exalted level made all the difference in the world. There was no way they could stop the Tiger Serpent now.<br>But weirdly enough, despite the furious roars of the Tiger Serpent, it didn&rsquo;t launch an attack against them. This anomaly made the crowd instinctively turn their sights toward Chu Feng.<br>If they were still harboring doubts earlier, the current happening verified what Chu Feng had told them. This Tiger Serpent was currently using the power of the storm to evolve and didn&rsquo;t want to waste any energy, so it wasn&rsquo;t attacking them just yet.<br>However, if it were to continue evolving, they couldn&rsquo;t imagine just what kind of level it would eventually reach.<br>Grar!<br>A furious howl suddenly sounded from the beast Li Muzhi was standing on. Li Muzhi forced himself to get to his feet and leaped away from the beast. The beast flew a distance away before&hellip;<br>Boom!<br>A resounding explosion echoed. The beast had just committed suicide!<br>At the same time, Li Muzhi spurted huge mouthfuls of blood. The explosion of the beast had inflicted severe damage on him.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng, take it!&rdquo;<br>However, Li Muzhi paid no heed to his injuries and tossed his soul possession treasure toward Chu Feng.<br>Upon seeing this, Zhao Shi, Ma Yueyue, and the others quickly emulated Li Muzhi&rsquo;s actions.<br>In order to avoid taking away their beasts running rampant after releasing their control on them, they chose to use the soul possession treasures to have those beasts self-explode before handing them over to Chu Feng.<br>It was just that the soul possession treasures were currently linked to those beasts, so the self-explosion of those beasts would inadvertently harm them as well.<br>However, all of them still did it without hesitation and tossed their soul possession treasures to Chu Feng right after.<br>It was quite a valiant sight, just that it triggered one person&rsquo;s displeasure&mdash;Zuoqiu Yanliang.<br>&ldquo;The lot of you actually believe his lies? How utterly foolish!&rdquo; Zuoqiu Yanliang spat.<br>If not for the severity of his injuries, he would have surely tried to stop them.<br>&ldquo;Senior Zuoqiu, there are no other solutions at the moment either. It&rsquo;d be better to give it a try than to just give up here and wait for our deaths.&rdquo;<br>Zhao Shi and the others quickly explained out of fear of offending Zuoqiu Yanliang.<br>&ldquo;Ridiculous. Even if a frontal attack doesn&rsquo;t work, there are still other methods we can try. Yet, he wants to use the soul possession treasures to take control of the Hellking? That&rsquo;s just suicidal! Why don&rsquo;t you take a good look at the difference in the cultivation between the Hellking and Chu Feng? As personal disciples, how could you entrust your own lives to a mere newcomer? Are you brainless?!&rdquo; Zuoqiu Yanliang hollered.<br>Zhao Shi and the others simply lowered their heads and ignored Zuoqiu Yanliang. They believed in Chu Feng, but they dared not to talk back to Zuoqiu Yanliang.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng, are you certain about this? Are you certain that you&rsquo;ll be able to control the Hellking?&rdquo;<br>Even Song Qian couldn&rsquo;t help but look at Chu Feng worriedly. She felt that what Zuoqiu Yanliang mentioned made sense. After all, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was simply too low compared to the rest of them.<br>Besides, there was a limit to what the soul possession treasures could do too. Typically speaking, it was already an amazing feat for a rank nine Utmost Exalted level cultivator to control a rank two Martial Exalted level beast.<br>However, Chu Feng was clearly not at rank nine Utmost Exalted level, and the Hellking was at rank five Martial Exalted level. To make things worse, it was likely that the Hellking&rsquo;s real cultivation was even higher than this.<br>&ldquo;That senior over there, do you have any other ideas in mind?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;<br>A tight furrow formed on Song Qian&rsquo;s forehead as she fell silent. She indeed didn&rsquo;t have any other solution in mind.<br>Seeing this, Chu Feng simply smiled lightly as he quickly put on the six soul possession treasures. Then, he leaped forward to stand before the Tiger Serpent.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was really going to make a move, Zuoqiu Yanliang immediately bellowed furiously, &ldquo;Junior Song, hurry up and stop him! Even if we were to die, we can&rsquo;t let this kind of fool bring us to our doom!&rdquo;<br>His agitation caused blood to spurt out of his mouth, and it was followed by a violent fit of coughs.<br>His injuries were simply too severe that he didn&rsquo;t even have the strength to exert his oppressive might or control the beast beneath him. Otherwise, he would have surely killed Chu Feng right away.<br>As for Song Qian, she was already iffy about all of this right from the start, and Zuoqiu Yanliang&rsquo;s orders further convinced her to make a move.<br>&ldquo;Stop me if you wish to die!&rdquo;<br>But before she could do anything, Chu Feng suddenly shot her a frosty look that caused her body to shudder. Her face swiftly drained of blood, turning ghastly pale.<br>Her cultivation was clearly much higher than Chu Feng&rsquo;s, but she seemed to see something incredibly terrifying in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>And in the moment of her hesitation, Chu Feng finished forming his hand seals to release the energy of the soul possession treasures.<br>The next moment, the eyes of the Tiger Serpent immediately calmed down, revealing a gaze similar to Chu Feng&rsquo;s. At the same time, it also stopped its furious roars, becoming incredibly docile.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; Does this mean that&hellip;&rdquo;<br>This sight shocked not just Zuoqiu Yanliang and Song Qian, but even Li Muzhi and the others too. No matter how slow they might be, it was clear as day that Chu Feng had managed to put the Tiger Serpent under his control!<br></p></div>
