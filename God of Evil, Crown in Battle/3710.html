        <h1>Chapter 3709</h1>
        <div> - Unable To Withstand<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The reason why Chu Xuanzhengfa asked this question was because everything there was identical to the Mirror Sea.<br>However, there was one thing that was different. That place did not possess a sea surface. Above them was a boundless area of rocks. Deep below them was also a boundless area of rocks.<br>The rocks were indestructible, and had sealed both the area above and the area below them.<br>&ldquo;This should be the Mirror Sea. There&rsquo;s no mistaking this sensation. However, this should be a special region within the Mirror Sea.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that things are strange. Even though I clearly sensed a very dangerous aura before entering this place, how come that has aura disappeared upon arriving here?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng began to ponder. He felt that that place was very strange, and should not be as simple as it appeared to be.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a bell toll was heard.<br>When the bell tolled, the seawater started trembling.<br>The next moment, Chu Feng was able to sense the undercurrents of the seawater becoming increasingly ice-cold. The piercing pain present in the water also grew much stronger.<br>Whilst Chu Feng was still able to withstand the pain, Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s face was already twisted with pain. He clenched his fists tightly, and his entire body was stretched taut.<br>Evidently, the power had increased to a level that Chu Xuanzhengfa could not withstand.<br>That was precisely what had happened.<br>After entering the Mirror Sea, the invasion from the undercurrent had begun to affect Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>Earlier, he had forced himself to endure it. However, after that strange bell rung, the undercurrent within the seawater grew even fiercer.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa was no longer able to withstand it. His awareness was starting to become fuzzy.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa felt that he was in enormous danger. If this were to continue, he might end up dying!!!<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a warm current began to enter him from his left arm and engulfed his entire body.<br>The warm current was opposing the undercurrent&rsquo;s coldness.<br>In this sort of situation, Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s consciousness recovered, and his body was no longer in such pain.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?!&rdquo;<br>After opening his eyes, Chu Xuanzhengfa discovered that Chu Feng was holding his left arm.<br>Without the need to think about it, Chu Xuanzhengfa knew that the warm current was released by Chu Feng. Chu Feng was helping him.<br>&ldquo;Senior, don&rsquo;t say anything. Since I&rsquo;ve come here, I&rsquo;m going to bring you out alive,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa wanted to say something. However, before he could finish his words, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;Senior, there&rsquo;s no but. Look&hellip; aren&rsquo;t I fine?&rdquo;<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa carefully examined Chu Feng, and discovered that he was indeed fine.<br>Although he felt like he was on the verge of death enduring that power, Chu Feng had decided to endure that power himself whilst also helping him. Chu Feng&rsquo;s action was akin to enduring twice the amount of power.<br>Yet, Chu Feng looked like he was completely fine.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s willpower and tolerance was simply countless times stronger than his own.<br>Suddenly, Chu Xuanzhengfa let out a sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually quite pathetic.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly asked.<br>&ldquo;When I was young, I was completely suppressed by your father&rsquo;s talent. It was truly difficult to endure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;m old, I&rsquo;m being suppressed by his son. However, this time around, it&rsquo;s not difficult to endure. Instead, I feel very comfortable. After all, you&rsquo;re saving my life,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said with a smile.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng also smiled. He had never expected Chu Xuanzhengfa to also be able to joke around.<br>Furthermore, he was joking during such a crucial moment of life and death.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this place is quite strange. We cannot resign ourselves to fate. Let us inspect the surroundings and see if we can find an exit.&rdquo;<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa expressed his agreement to Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. Then, the two of them began to search for an exit.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>Not long afterward, the strange bell tolled again.<br>Chu Feng was unable to determine exactly where that sound originated from because it came from all directions simultaneously.<br>One could hear it from afar and one could hear it nearby. In fact, it was sounding right next to Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>It was as if the sound originated from the seawater itself. When the bell sounded, all of the seawater emitted the same sound.<br>Most terrifying of all, after the bell tolled, the seawater&rsquo;s undercurrent strengthened again.<br>With this, Chu Feng became certain that the undercurrent would strengthen with every toll, and would begin to attack their souls with greater power.<br>Furthermore, after an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time passed, that bell would toll again. With every toll, the undercurrent would also become stronger.<br>In the beginning, Chu Feng was able to endure the undercurrent and continue to attempt to find an exit.<br>However, to his despair, after he searched for some time, he was unable to find an exit. Even his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes were unable to detect any clues. It was as if there was no exit to begin with, that they would be trapped there for the rest of their lives.<br>To Chu Feng&rsquo;s greater despair, as time passed, he began to find it difficult to endure the undercurrent.<br>He was still moving around earlier. However, it soon became very difficult for him to move around. He was simply unable to search for an exit anymore.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let go of me. I won&rsquo;t last, don&rsquo;t waste your strength on me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let go of me. It&rsquo;s better that I die than both of us die.&rdquo;<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa spoke with great difficulty. Even though Chu Feng had been helping him the entire time, the power of the undercurrent had increased so much that Chu Xuanzhengfa was unable to endure it even with his help.<br>Soon, Chu Xuanzhengfa lost consciousness, and was unable to even speak.<br>However, he was still alive. Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t possibly give up on him.<br>Not only was Chu Feng continuing to help Chu Xuanzhengfa, but he even increased his protection of him.<br>However, because of that, it weakened his own tolerance.<br>Gradually, even Chu Feng&rsquo;s consciousness began to grow fuzzy.<br>He was no longer able to hear the bell anymore. He was unable to determine the passage of time. All he could do was feel the unbearable undercurrent&rsquo;s power attacking him..<br>Like blades, the power of the undercurrent passed through his body and cut at his soul. An inch at a time, they engulfed him.<br>If this were to continue, no matter how powerful his willpower might be, he would still crumble to the undercurrent&rsquo;s power.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Above the Mirror Sea were four figures.<br>One of them was Chu Lingxi. Although she had fused with the Deepsea Pupils, her fusion was not complete. Thus, she was still sleeping.<br>As for the other three, they were Grandmaster Liangqiu, old man Zhu, and Gu Mingyuan.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu had actually called Gu Mingyuan back through voice transmission.<br>To be able to call her back, Grandmaster Liangqiu had naturally told her that Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa might still be able to survive.<br>Thus, Gu Mingyuan also knew that if Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t manage to save both himself and Chu Xuanzhengfa, they could only wait for Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s friend to save them.<br>Suddenly, Grandmaster Liangqiu said, &ldquo;Four hours should&rsquo;ve passed by now, right?&rdquo;<br>Even though Grandmaster Liangqiu was confident in Chu Feng, he remained somewhat worried.<br>He was afraid that an accident might happen to...<br>If old man Zhu was willing to act and save Chu Feng, it would naturally be for the best.<br></p></div>
