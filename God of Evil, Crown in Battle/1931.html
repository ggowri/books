        <div> - Moment Of Crisis<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Little fellow, while you&rsquo;re not large, your speed is quite fast. You are not a Royal Spirit Insect. Exactly what are you? Could you also be a treasure that Chu Feng obtained from somewhere?&rdquo; the YinYang Immortal asked Lil Red.<br>&ldquo;You are not allowed to harm great sir. Else, I will bite you to death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am poisonous. Merely my saliva itself would be capable of killing you and destroying your soul,&rdquo; Lil Red said with a ferocious expression.<br>&ldquo;Hahahahaha&hellip;&rdquo; the YinYang Immortal burst into loud laughter. From the beginning, he had found it ridiculous that a little insect dared to speak to him in such a manner.<br>However, soon, his laughter became one of anger. In the end, it became one filled with fury. Even the weather was altered by his state of mind.<br>Suddenly, he aimed his Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade at Lil Red and shouted angrily, &ldquo;A mere little insect actually dares to boast so shamelessly to me. Did you really consider me, the YinYang Immortal, to be a fool?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. If you dare to harm great sir, I will bite you to death even if I am to die doing so,&rdquo; However, Lil Red was not at all afraid of the YinYang Immortal. Instead, it was extremely unyielding. It was as if Lil Red had already seen through life and death.<br>&ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll kill you too. I&rsquo;ll let the two of you die together,&rdquo; Filled with anger, the YinYang Immortal planned to kill both Lil Red and Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a loud explosion suddenly sounded from the cave nearby.<br>&ldquo;Mn?&rdquo; the YinYang Immortal hurriedly turned his gaze toward the noise, and discovered that an enormous crack had appeared in the cave nearby. Countless crushed rocks were falling down. Furthermore, he was able to sense a special sort of aura from within the cave. Merely, even though he was carefully inspecting the cave, he was unable to discover anyone or anything inside.<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded from below. &ldquo;YinYang Immortal, was it you who injured Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>The YinYang Immortal turned his gaze below. At that moment, his eyes started to shine with shock.<br>The reason for that was because below him was not only the unconscious Chu Feng and the furious Lil Red, there was also a young girl.<br>This girl possessed a head of blonde hair and a beautiful appearance. Especially her pair of eyes; they were simply the pinnacle of beauty. However, incomparable rage and dense killing intent was being emitted from her eyes at that moment.<br>&ldquo;Princess Miaomiao, why would you be here?&rdquo; The YinYang Immortal was shocked to see Xian Miaomiao. Not only did he know who Miaomiao was, he had also met her several times. As such, the two of them could be considered to be acquaintances.<br>&ldquo;It was you who injured Chu Feng, right?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao asked again. Her eyes were filled with murderous intent.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly, the YinYang Immortal chuckled. Sensing the killing intent in Xian MIaomiao&rsquo;s eyes that was growing stronger and stronger, he found it to be extremely funny.<br>&ldquo;It seems like you have some dealings with that Chu Feng. Do even the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves want to ride on the tailwind vessel that is Chu Feng, hug onto the enormous tree that could reach the sky, but has yet to mature?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha, truly amusing,&rdquo; The YinYang Immortal mocked and ridiculed.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask you again. Was it you who injured Chu Feng?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao asked again. Her tone was extremely sharp.<br>&ldquo;Princess Miaomiao, the speed of your cultivation progress is truly fast. How did you already become a rank five Martial Emperor?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, even if you are a rank five Martial Emperor with a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, you will still not be able to do anything to me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For I am a rank six Martial Emperor with a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. Thus, do not give me that arrogant behavior as if you are capable of killing me at any moment should you wish it,&rdquo; the YinYang Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>In an instant, Xian Miaomiao suddenly raised her hand, and a cold ray swept forth. &ldquo;Puchi,&rdquo; the arm with which the YinYang Immortal was holding the Ancient Alligator Body Piercing Blade was actually sliced off.<br>&ldquo;Ahhh~~~~&rdquo;<br>The pain of having his arm sliced off caused the YinYang Immortal to scream miserably. Shock! incomparable shock filled his eyes. When he looked to Xian Miaomiao again, he was filled with disbelief.<br>&ldquo;Who told you that I possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao asked with a cold voice.<br>&ldquo;A heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation, you actually also possess a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation?!&rdquo; After verifying this matter, the YinYang Immortal grew even more astonished.<br>If Xian Miaomiao possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, he would be able to fight against her. However, Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s battle power was capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation. This meant that he no longer possessed the capability to fight against her.<br>Although the YinYang Immortal was a rank six Martial Emperor, he, like most Martial Emperors, only possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. However, when compared to Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation, she still possessed two additional levels of cultivation that she could surmount, whereas all of his advantages would be gone.<br>With a cultivation of rank five Martial Emperor and a battle power capable of surmounting two additional levels of cultivation at the Martial Emperor realm, it meant that Xian Miaomiao was capable of fighting on par against rank seven Martial Emperors. Naturally, he, a rank six Martial Emperor, would be no match for Xian Miaomiao.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve injured Chu Feng. As such, I&rsquo;ll take your life,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao said coldly.<br>&ldquo;No, Princess Miaomiao, please wait. I was not the one who injured Chu Feng. He lost consciousness by himself,&rdquo; The YinYang Immortal hurriedly tried to explain. He even looked to Lil Red and added, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe me, go and ask that earthworm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are the earthworm! Your entire family are earthworms!&rdquo; Lil Red cursed.<br>Xian Miaomiao looked to Lil Red and asked, &ldquo;Lil Red, is what he said true?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Lil Red&rsquo;s little eyes started to spin around in circles, as if it was pondering something. After pondering for some time, Lil Red said, &ldquo;Yes, that is the truth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Look, I didn&rsquo;t lie,&rdquo; The YinYang Immortal hurriedly interrupted.<br>&ldquo;Even if that is the case, Chu Feng&rsquo;s injury is related to you. As such, your life cannot be spared,&rdquo; As Xian Miaomiao spoke, she extended a lily-white hand and grabbed at the empty space before her. &ldquo;Snap!&rdquo; Many cracks began to appear in the space around the YinYang Immortal like a bunch of spiderwebs. Then, those cracks turned into an enormous net and sealed the YinYang Immortal within them.<br>As if he had been placed into a sack created by the void and space itself, the YinYang Immortal fell to the ground.<br>What Xian Miaomiao had used was no ordinary technique. Instead, it was a Taboo Martial Skill.<br>&ldquo;Wuu~~~&rdquo;<br>Even though the YinYang Immortal struggled violently, he was unable to do anything to the net that Xian Miaomiao had made to capture him. In fact, he was unable to even speak. Simply put, his life was in Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s hands.<br>&ldquo;You dared bully great sir, you dared bully great sir. I&rsquo;ll ram you to death, I&rsquo;ll ram you to death.&rdquo;<br>Little Red immediately ran over and began to rapidly ram its little body into the YinYang Immortal.<br>As the YinYang Immortal was restricted, he was unable to dodge Lil Red&rsquo;s rammings. However, Lil Red was simply unable to injure the YinYang Immortal with the strength that she possessed.<br>However, even with that being the case, the YinYang Immortal was still incomparably angry. He, the grand YinYang Immortal, had actually been imprisoned. Furthermore, a little insect was ramming itself into him nonstop. Oh how humiliating this was. If this matter were to spread, his grand reputation would be completely ruined.<br>Although the YinYang Immortal had declared that he only cared about strength and not his reputation, he actually&hellip; cared deeply about his reputation.<br>&ldquo;His injuries are actually this serious. It seems like the result of a backlash. Could it be that it&rsquo;s because of that sword?&rdquo;<br>Xian Miaomiao was squatting beside Chu Feng and carefully observing the condition of his injuries. Even though she was not a world spiritist, she possessed an extremely powerful perception. In terms of perception, she was not inferior to ordinary world spiritists.<br>As she saw Chu Feng lying on the ground with serious injuries the moment she woke up, she did not know what had happened at all. All she knew was that the YinYang Immortal had wanted to kill Chu Feng.<br>However, she was able to sense that the injuries to Chu Feng&rsquo;s dantian were extremely serious. Furthermore, she noticed that it was related to the Evil God Sword in Chu Feng&rsquo;s right hand.<br></p></div>
