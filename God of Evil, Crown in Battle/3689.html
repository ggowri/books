        <h1>Chapter 3688</h1>
        <div> - Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s Challenge<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This matter was of great importance.<br>It was not only Gu Mingyuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu that understood this, but even Chu Xuanzhengfa also knew its importance.<br>As such, he had already ordered his men to arrest the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s experts, and was prepared to interrogate them.<br>That said, he had also walked over to Gu Mingyuan.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa looked somewhat excited. Even the bystanders were able to tell that he was extremely joyous upon seeing Gu Mingyuan.<br>That said, he was also somewhat nervous at the same time. His current behavior was completely different from how he usually acted.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa and Gu Mingyuan did not possess the intimacy of a married couple. Instead, they were reserved like strangers.<br>&ldquo;What did you call me?&rdquo;<br>After hearing Chu Xuanzhengfa expressing his thanks, Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s complexion turned gloomy.<br>Compared to Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s reserve, the attitude displayed by Gu Mingyuan was more than only that of strangers.<br>&ldquo;This old man misspoke.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I hope that the Princess of the Ancient Clan is willing to forgive me.&rdquo;<br>It was only at that moment that Chu Xuanzhengfa realized that he had misspoken, and immediately apologized.<br>&ldquo;Keep your distance from me in the future,&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan said coldly.<br>Faced with such a Gu Mingyuan, Chu Xuanzhengfa had an embarrassed look on his face and was speechless.<br>Even though many people knew that Gu Mingyuan disliked Chu Xuanzhengfa, they all thought that it was because they had some sort of misunderstanding in the past.<br>No matter what, they were Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s parents, and were husband and wife at one point.<br>Never had they ever imagined Gu Mingyuan to be so cold towards Chu Xuanzhengfa. Her behavior had reached a state of being fed up.<br>&ldquo;Mother, why are you acting like this?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice was heard. Chu Lingxi had walked over.<br>Furthermore, she was looking at Gu Mingyuan with complaint in her eyes.<br>Evidently, she was unable to tolerate her treating her father in such a manner.<br>After all, Chu Lingxi had a very close relationship with him.<br>Even though Gu Mingyuan did not recognize Chu Xuanzhengfa as her husband, Chu Lingxi had recognized him as her father.<br>In fact, Chu Lingxi leaned toward her father more. Otherwise, she would not have rather stayed in the Chu Heavenly Clan than return to the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan.<br>After Chu Lingxi walked over, Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s body shifted, and then disappeared.<br>Even though she did not continue to make things difficult for Chu Xuanzhengfa, she did not change her attitude towards him, instead deciding to evade him.<br>&ldquo;Lord father, my mother still has a misunderstanding towards you. This misunderstanding will need to be slowly resolved. I will help you with it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Before it is resolved, it is best that you keep some distance from her. You also know about her personality; you will only put yourself on the spot and make things awkward,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said through voice transmission.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa, who had a look of embarrassment earlier, did not get angry because of Gu Mingyuan's attitude.<br>Instead, he took a glance at Chu Lingxi and then smiled. &ldquo;Lingxi, your improvement has truly shocked your father. Even though I already knew that you would surpass me, I never anticipated that you would surpass me this quickly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Xuanzhengfa, have always dreamed of becoming a genius. My daughter has helped me realize that dream.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Xuanzhengfa looked at Chu Lingxi, pride filled his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Surpassing Lord Father is merely the first step. The third step would be surpassing Lady Mother,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said proudly.<br>&ldquo;With your talent, it is not impossible to surpass your mother.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Xuanzhengfa asked, &ldquo;Mn? Third step? What about the second step?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The second step would be to surpass big brother Chu Feng,&rdquo; After saying those words, Chu Lingxi turned her gaze to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; Chu Feng was standing nearby. He heard her words very clearly. Because of that, he felt rather surprised.<br>He had not expected Chu Lingxi to consider him a target to surpass.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, I also feel very sad about what happened to senior Chu Xuanyuan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, ever since my father mentioned the matters concerning your father to me, I felt great respect for him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Regretfully, I was not born in the same era as senior, and did not have the chance to witness how dazzling he was back then. I am also destined to be unable to spar with him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I am very fortunate, fortunate that I am able to encounter you, big brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though I know this request of mine is very ill-timed, I am too impatient, and want to challenge you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you able to spar with me?&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi asked Chu Feng with extreme earnestness.<br>Seeing Chu Lingxi like that, Chu Feng&rsquo;s impression of her changed.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell from her gaze that she was not only very serious, but she was also longing for him to accept her challenge so that she could spar with him to determine who was stronger.<br>Her desire had nothing to do with familial affection or friendship; it was purely from her competitiveness as a martial cultivator.<br>After hearing Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s words, the crowd present also started to look forward to it.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s current actual cultivation was also that of a rank three Exalted.<br>Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s current actual cultivation was also that of a rank three Exalted.<br>What did rank three Exalted represent?<br>One must know that the person deemed to be the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s strongest genius, Linghu Hongfei, was only a rank two Exalted when he fought Chu Feng in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.<br>Judging from the current situation, both Chu Feng and Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s cultivation had already surpassed Linghu Hongfei.<br>The two of them had reached levels of cultivations that other people of the younger generation simply could not compare to.<br>Thus, if Chu Lingxi was to fight Chu Feng, the winner of their battle would become the actual strongest genius of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>This was a showdown that no one wanted to miss out on.<br>However, the crowd also knew that Chu Xuanyuan had just died, and the Chu Heavenly Clan had suffered from a crusade. Thus, Chu Feng was most definitely exhausted in both body and mind.<br>Would he accept her challenge at such a time?<br>However, under the crowd&rsquo;s uncertain gazes, before Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s serious gaze, Chu Feng finally answered, &ldquo;Lingxi, if you want to fight, I will not hold back.&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all overjoyed upon hearing those words. This was precisely what they wanted to hear.<br>After all, should Chu Feng accept it, they would be able to witness a marvelous confrontation.<br>That said, in terms of feeling joyous, the most joyous person would be Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I will also not hold back,&rdquo; she said.<br></p></div>
