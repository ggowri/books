        <h1>Chapter 3471</h1>
        <div> - Hidden Paths And Open Path<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All of the people that were defeated by Chu Feng were eliminated.<br>As for Chu Feng, he also managed to obtain a key.<br>Afterwards, the other competitors all entered that spirit formation gate.<br>Roughly four hours later, someone exited the gate.<br>After the first person exited the gate, the second and third person soon followed.<br>Not long afterward, a total of a hundred people all walked out from the gate in succession.<br>After the hundredth person walked out from the spirit formation gate, Wuming Ken formed a hand seal and shouted gently. In an instant, a surging aura burst forth from the spirit formation gate. That aura wave was filled with people.<br>In merely an instant, all of the people that had entered the spirit formation gate were brought out by that aura.<br>As for these people, they were all eliminated.<br>Wuming Ken then recalled the enormous gate. Then, the show officially began.<br>The first hundred individuals that managed to walk out from the gate and the ten people on the Apex Pillars, a total of a hundred and ten individuals, were qualified to enter the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound to compete for a ranking amongst the Ancestral Martial Decastars.<br>It could be said that the remaining one hundred and ten people were the elites chosen from several hundred thousand people of the younger generation.<br>The weakest amongst those one hundred and ten individuals were Heavenly Immortals. There was no one among them that could be considered weak.<br>Not only were they very strong, but they also mostly belonged to famous families and powers. They were all known geniuses.<br>Seeing those one hundred and ten individuals, the expressions of anticipation in the crowd&rsquo;s eyes grew even more intense. They all knew that the actual show was going to start.<br>&ldquo;I believe a lot of people have heard about the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound already. This is a land from the legends. According to the legends, this place directly connects to the depths of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, we do not know if that legend is real. All we know is that there have been countless people that have entered the NIne Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound. Yet, no one has managed to reach the depths of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In fact, many of the people that entered the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound ended up disappearing forever, with no corpse to be found.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound has a total of thirty hidden paths.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Reportedly, ten of the hidden paths are safe, whereas the remaining twenty will lead to death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Only by using the ten safe hidden paths would one be able to reach the Nine Dragons Upper Realm&rsquo;s deep abyss. Even if one is unable to find their way to the deep abyss, one will still be able to safely exit the ten safe hidden paths.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if one is unfortunate enough to enter a hidden path of death, one will have an enormous chance of death. Furthermore, the twenty hidden paths of death are all different from one another. Among them, nineteen of them will present an enormous chance of death, whereas the final one will bring about certain death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Most disturbing of all, the location of the life paths and death paths are not set in place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if the entrance you entered today is a hidden path of life, it might become a hidden path of death tomorrow.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is also the reason why the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound is so mystical.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is precisely because we are fond of how mystical the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound is that we decided to hold the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars here this year.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone, look over there,&rdquo; after saying those words, Wuming Ken pointed toward the depths of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the earth started to tremble. Ten areas began to protrude from the flat land that Wuming Ken pointed to.<br>&ldquo;Those are ten positions. Each position can accommodate a single person. The first ten people that manage to reach those positions shall be the new Ancestral Martial Decastars.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After selecting the new Ancestral Martial Decastars, matches will then be held. The results of the matches shall determine the rankings of the new Ancestral Martial Decastars,&rdquo; Wuming Ken said.<br>&ldquo;Of course, whilst you all can choose to proceed through the hidden paths, you can also choose to directly proceed toward the ten positions without going through the hidden paths. It is up to you as to which of the two choices, the hidden paths or the open path, to take,&rdquo; he added.<br>&ldquo;The hidden paths are filled with dangers. If one is unlucky enough to enter a hidden path of death, one will find it very difficult to survive. Who would possibly choose to take on the hidden paths?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, even fools would choose to take the open path. Who would choose to take a hidden path without good cause? That&rsquo;s nothing but a crazy act.&rdquo;<br>Hearing Wuming Ken&rsquo;s explanation, the crowd felt that no one would possibly choose to take the hidden paths. After all, the hidden paths were filled with dangers, whereas the surface of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound did not appear to be abnormal at all, and seemed like an ordinary piece of land.<br>To martial cultivators, it would be an area that one could sweep past in the blink of an eye.<br>Choosing the hidden paths would bring the enormous danger of death upon oneself. If one were unlucky enough to select the most dangerous hidden path, they would even end up with certain death, and be gone forever.<br>However, if one were to choose the open path, one would be able to easily reach the ten positions.<br>When those two choices were placed alongside one another, there was simply no need to think about which one to take. Everyone would choose the open path.<br>Thus, at that moment, many people began to call what the Starfield Master Realm was planning into question. They felt that the choice was simply meaningless.<br>Of course, no one dared to openly voice their opinions. Even if they felt that way, they would only think it amongst themselves, or discuss it with their friends through voice transmissions.<br></p></div>
