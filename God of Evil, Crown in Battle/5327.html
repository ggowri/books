        <h1>Chapter 5328</h1>
        <div>: The Chosen One?<br>&ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you know what&rsquo;s the Chosen One? I, Zhou Dong, am the person who has been chosen by the Ancient Realm. This final test is prepared just for me,&rdquo; Zhou Dong replied.<br>Chu Feng realized that the reason Zhou Dong was able to catch up with them all alone was due to his special means, but what he was more concerned with was the fact that Bai Yunqing had been held hostage.<br>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, if you don&rsquo;t want your brother dead, you should hand over the key and the phenomenon orbs you have gathered,&rdquo; Zhou Dong ordered.<br>Chu Feng looked at the white-haired woman. He did want to save Bai Yunqing, but the key and the phenomenon orbs didn&rsquo;t just belong to him.<br>The white-haired woman understood the meaning behind Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze and replied, &ldquo;Up to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng threw the key and the phenomenon orbs in Zhou Dong&rsquo;s direction, side, but he made them stop a distance away from the latter. He knew that he couldn&rsquo;t hand them over so easily, or else Zhou Dong could renege on his promise and refuse to release Bai Yunqing.<br>&ldquo;Release Bai Yunqing first,&rdquo; Chu Feng demanded.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m not interested in this fellow&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; Zhou Dong replied.<br>He abruptly tossed Bai Yunqing toward Chu Feng while charging straight for the key and the phenomenon orbs.<br>Chu Feng could tell that Zhou Dong had left a hand inside Bai Yunqing. If he tried to stop Zhou Dong from obtaining the key and the phenomenon orbs right now, the latter could take Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s life right away. He had no choice but to let Zhou Dong take everything.<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha! I really ought to thank you, Chu Feng. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to clear the final test so easily if not for you.&rdquo; Zhou Dong laughed gleefully.<br>At the same time, Bai Yunqing safely fell into Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands.<br>Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, the white-haired woman charged at Zhou Dong.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Zhou Dong showed no fear. A triumphant smile formed on his face as a spirit formation gate manifested behind him. He retreated into the spirit formation gate and closed it shut.<br>&ldquo;How is that possible?&rdquo;<br>The white-haired woman couldn&rsquo;t believe what had just happened. She turned to Chu Feng for answers.<br>&ldquo;The spirit formation gate he conjured shares a similar aura as this place. I don&rsquo;t know what he has been through, but he has probably acquired some sort of power here,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a frown.<br>He initially thought that Zhou Dong had shaken off the poison&rsquo;s effects and caught up with them with his sheer strength, but it looked like there was more to it than that. The fact that Zhou Dong was able to conjure a spirit formation gate earlier showed something.<br>This didn&rsquo;t bode well.<br>Knowing that speculation was futile, Chu Feng turned his effort into freeing Bai Yunqing instead.<br>As soon as Bai Yunqing was freed, he cried out, &ldquo;Big brother, I didn&rsquo;t say anything at all. I didn&rsquo;t betray you! I don&rsquo;t know why he knew about the key and the phenomenon orbs either!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>Considering how Zhou Dong had grasped the power to manifest spirit formation gates here, it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising for him to know the details about this trial too.<br>Boom!<br>A loud explosion could suddenly be heard. Green aura started clouding the sky above, covering the stars.<br>&ldquo;He must be behind this. I&rsquo;m going to capture him,&rdquo; the white-haired woman said. She was unwilling to take this lying.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go.&rdquo; Chu Feng stopped her.<br>&ldquo;The smoke is coming in from all directions; it&rsquo;s impossible to figure out where he is. Besides, he might possess other means too. It isn&rsquo;t wise to confront him now,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Am I to turn a blind eye to this after how he took advantage of us?&rdquo; the white-haired woman exclaimed indignantly.<br>She felt indignant not just for herself but for Chu Feng. She knew that Chu Feng had shouldered the bulk of the load in carrying them this far, to the point where she was prepared to relinquish the reward of the final test to him.<br>However, this didn&rsquo;t mean that she was willing to relinquish the reward to Zhou Dong.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I neglected to tell you. That key has to be awakened by a phenomenon, but this phenomenon is not just limited to those acquired from killing the monstrous beasts. We were able to fuse our gathered phenomenon orbs together because we are teammates, but in the presence of rivals, this trial turns into a competition instead. The side with the stronger phenomenon will be the one to awaken the key,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>In other words, Chu Feng and the others would be able to get the key back if they could produce an even stronger phenomenon.<br>&ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t be able to make it in time even if we start hunting monstrous beasts now!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing cried.<br>&ldquo;There might still be a chance, but it doesn&rsquo;t require us to hunt down monstrous beasts,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he sat down cross-legged.<br>The white-haired woman and Bai Yunqing were utterly confused as to what Chu Feng was trying to do, but Eggy&rsquo;s eyes lit up in joy.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, could it be that you&rsquo;ve succeeded?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Just on time, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he took out the Dragon Inner Pill.<br>He had already grasped the way for him to make a breakthrough, but he lacked the martial power to pull it off. Thus, he had been waiting for the Dragon Inner Pill to be fully refined so that he could assimilate its martial power to compensate for his own deficiency.<br>And if he made a breakthrough now, it would surely summon a heavenly lightning phenomenon. Who could possibly compete with the phenomenon he summoned?<br>Chu Feng swallowed the Dragon Inner Pill right away.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you can&rsquo;t consume the Dragon Inner Pill just like that!&rdquo; the white-haired woman exclaimed in astonishment.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I know what I&rsquo;m doing,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile before closing his eyes.<br>Moments later, a dragon silhouette formed around him. It was the aura of the Dragon Inner Pill.<br>The white-haired woman&rsquo;s eyes widened in disbelief.<br>The appearance of the dragon silhouette meant that Chu Feng had successfully assimilated the full power of the Dragon Inner Pill, but it was unheard of for any Totem Dragon Clansmen to do it that quickly, let alone an outsider!<br>Not to mention that the Dragon Inner Pill was forged solely for Totem Dragon Clansmen&rsquo;s use!<br>Yet, Chu Feng actually managed to pull it off. She had known that he was monstrously talented, but she didn&rsquo;t think that it would be to such an extent!<br>Boom!<br>Deafening lightning bolts intersected in the sky. These weren&rsquo;t ordinary lightning bolts but nine-colored lightning. They converged together to form nine massive roaring lightning beasts. Their might was so great that it threatened to tear the fabrics of space apart.<br>The green aura that was covering the sky earlier began to dissipate upon the appearance of the nine massive lightning beasts. It was as if the true rulers of the sky had appeared.<br>&ldquo;What powerful nine-colored lightning! Is big brother Chu Feng going to make a breakthrough?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing looked at Chu Feng.<br>The white-haired woman didn&rsquo;t say a word, but she could hardly conceal her shock as she alternated her gaze between Chu Feng and the sky.<br>&ldquo;What an incredible phenomenon. I have never seen anything like this before. Is it really just a normal breakthrough? What in the world did big brother Chu Feng do?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing murmured.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Heavenly Lightning Affliction,&rdquo; the white-haired woman said.<br>&ldquo;Heavenly Lightning Affliction? I have seen Heavenly Lightning Afflictions before, but never one this terrifying. My gosh, this is too frightening. It feels like I&rsquo;ll be reduced to ashes if the heavenly lightning falls on me. I have never felt so pressured by such a phenomenon before. Miss Bai, do you feel the same too?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the white-haired woman replied.<br>Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s reaction wasn&rsquo;t exaggerated at all.<br>Even she was feeling intimidated by the huge pressure coming from the sky. She had seen the Heavenly Lightning Affliction summoned by cultivators possessing the Heavenly Bloodline, but just like Bai Yunqing, she had never seen one as scary as this.<br>Shoosh!<br>A ray of light suddenly shot across the sky. It moved at a speed so fast that not even the white-haired woman could stop it.<br>The ray of light landed behind Chu Feng.<br>Upon taking a closer look, both the white-haired woman and Bai Yunqing were stunned. It was the statue key, but the statue had come to life. The boy hopped and pranced around Chu Feng before finally plopping down beside him. He raised his head and looked at the nine massive lightning beasts in the sky with expectant eyes.<br>Soon, another silhouette flew over.<br>It was Zhou Dong, but his complexion looked awful.<br>&ldquo;Was he the one who summoned the phenomenon?&rdquo; Zhou Dong glared at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of your business. Get lost,&rdquo; the white-haired woman spat.<br>&ldquo;None of my business? He has already given the phenomenon orbs to me, but he actually made a breakthrough and summoned such a huge phenomenon to steal my key. How is this none of my business? Screw you, Chu Feng! Playing games with me? I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;<br>With seething rage, Zhou Dong thrust his palm at Chu Feng to take his life.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re courting death!&rdquo;<br>The white-haired woman also unleashed her killing intent, but a light barrier suddenly shrouded her before she could make a move. She was stunned, for she could sense the power harnessed in the light barrier.<br>As expected, when Zhou Dong&rsquo;s palm landed on the light barrier, it didn&rsquo;t stir the slightest ripple at all.<br>The white-haired woman turned around and saw that Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing were enveloped in the light barrier too.<br>It was the boy. He was still looking at the sky with innocent eyes, but there was no doubt that the light barrier had come from him.<br>Zhou Dong got even angrier when he saw how the key was protecting Chu Feng.<br>He opened up a spirit formation gate to teleport himself to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side, but to his astonishment, he was unable to enter the gate as if an invisible wall was blocking his path.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; Zhou Dong knew that he had already lost his chance. The key had already chosen Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You fool. Did you think that you can win with just your despicable means? My older brother has shown you how little tricks don&rsquo;t work in the face of absolute might! Chosen One? Pui!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing sneered.<br>Zhou Dong&rsquo;s eyes turned blood-red. He was trembling with anger, but there was nothing he could do anymore.<br>Boom!<br>All of a sudden, the nine lightning beasts converged into a pillar of lightning that descended from the sky and entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, as if it was where they belonged.<br>It was a sight that shocked not just the white-haired woman and Bai Yunqing, but Zhou Dong too. That was a Heavenly Lightning Affliction, but Chu Feng was overcoming it so easily?<br>No, overcoming it wasn&rsquo;t an apt description. There was no clash at all. The nine lightning beasts had fused with Chu Feng without the slightest resistance. Just how talented must he be?<br>Shoosh!<br>An immense pressure suddenly crushed down on the crowd&rsquo;s souls, causing them to shudder in fear. What was shocking was that this pressure was coming from none other than Chu Feng.<br>Goosebumps filled Zhou Dong&rsquo;s body.<br>The formation power he was harnessing in his body had suddenly dissipated, causing his fighting prowess to revert back to its original level. However, that was not what he was afraid of.<br>Chu Feng had opened his eyes, and he was no longer a Martial Exalted level cultivator.<br></div>
