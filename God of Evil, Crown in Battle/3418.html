        <h1>Chapter 3417</h1>
        <div> - Binding Technique<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The explosive voice that was suddenly heard was very resounding and imposing.<br>If a timid person were to hear that voice, they would definitely jump in shock.<br>In fact, when that voice was heard, even that killing-intent-filled female world spirit was startled.<br>Astonishment filled her beautiful, wide-open eyes.<br>The reason for that was because that voice sounded from Chu Feng&rsquo;s mouth.<br>Likely, even she did not expect Chu Feng, a fish on the chopping block, to have the confidence to shout at her to stop.<br>&ldquo;Girl, I will give you another chance. Quickly release me, your master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise&hellip; do not blame me for being impolite with you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to the world spirit.<br>&ldquo;Impudent,&rdquo; the female world spirit snorted coldly. Then, she planned to attack and kill Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, all of a sudden, the killing intent from that female world spirit instantly disappeared. She grabbed her head with her hands and took several steps back as a pained expression appeared on her beautiful face.<br>Due to the immense pain, she was unable to even stand stably and she fell on her butt powerlessly.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng, who was originally being restricted by her oppressive might, regained his freedom. He looked at the female world spirit with slight complacence, completely unsurprised.<br>With his hands behind his back, Chu Feng took confident strides as he walked toward the female world spirit. &ldquo;Girl, do you know your wrong now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bastard! What have you done to me?!&rdquo; The female world spirit let out an incomparably furious shout.<br>&ldquo;As a world spiritist, if I failed to even control my own world spirit, I would end up disgracing my mother enormously.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very simple. Before I entered a contract with you, I left a binding on the contract. Perhaps you were too urgent to enter a contract with me, and did not notice it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Despicable!!! Shameless!!!&rdquo; Upon learning the truth, the female world spirit grew even more furious.<br>&ldquo;Say, girl, you cannot blame me for this. If I didn&rsquo;t put that binding on the contract, I would&rsquo;ve been killed by you now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as you serve me obediently, I will definitely not bring harm to you.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke those words, the expression of the female world spirit that was originally enveloped in pain started to ease.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had lessened the binding of that female world spirit.<br>&ldquo;Even if you are to kill me, I will still never serve you,&rdquo; however, even though Chu Feng was being lenient toward her, the female world spirit remained very stubborn.<br>&ldquo;You have quite an unyielding character. However, I will not kill you. Even though I was not the one who captured Xue Ji, it remains that she is related to me. I am also responsible for what happened to her. Thus, it is understandable that you harbor hatred toward me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about this? I will not make things difficult for you. Return to where you came from.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After you return to the Asura Spirit World, I will remove our contract.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, with a thought, and a world spirit gate appeared in his world spirit space.<br>This was the same world spirit gate that the female world spirit had entered his world spirit space from. It was a world spirit gate that led to the Asura Spirit World.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that you were not the one who captured my young miss?&rdquo; That female world spirit asked while staring at Chu Feng. She seemed to be very concerned about the matter.<br>&ldquo;I was still an infant at that time. How could I possibly be able to enter the Asura Spirit World to capture your young miss?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I also feel that it was wrong to do such a thing, I will not allow you to harm the person who did that, for she is my mother,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Your mother?&rdquo; The female world spirit&rsquo;s gaze changed somewhat. She asked, &ldquo;Then why did your mother capture my young miss, bringing her into your world spirit space?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Due to certain reasons, my mother was unable to be by my side. However, she wanted to assist me in my growth. Thus, she captured two world spirits, and left them in my world spirit space in the hopes that they would help me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milady Queen also came here like that,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked at Eggy. His gaze became extremely gentle.<br>Although he felt that what his mother had done was wrong, he was very glad that she did such a thing.<br>If his mother hadn&rsquo;t captured the two world spirits and imprisoned them in his body, Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t have had the opportunity to meet Eggy, a great mentor and close friend.<br>&ldquo;Well then, I&rsquo;ve told you all that I know. Everything I&rsquo;ve said is true. There&rsquo;s not a single lie.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, you can return,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Before I find my young miss, I cannot return.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can remove your contract with me,&rdquo; the female world spirit said.<br>&ldquo;If I am to remove our contract in my world, you will turn into an evil spirit,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;So what if I&rsquo;m to turn into an evil spirit? As long as I can find my young miss, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; the female world spirit said with a determined look in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;No, that wouldn&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the female world spirit.<br>&ldquo;Your strength is currently above mine. If I am to remove our contract, how will I control you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once I remove our contract, even if you turned into an evil spirit, you could still attack and kill me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I guarantee you that as long as you remove our contract, I will definitely not attack you,&rdquo; the female world spirit guaranteed.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng suddenly smiled, &ldquo;Say, girl, you just deceived me earlier, and you were determined to kill me from the bottom of your heart. Do you really think that I will believe your words?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I swear upon the heavens that I will definitely not break my promise,&rdquo; the female world spirit said.<br>&ldquo;Forget it. Don&rsquo;t bother saying anything like that. I will give you two choices.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can either return to your Asura Spirit World right now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Or you can obediently be my world spirit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will be searching for that old cat anyways. Thus, you will be able to fight alongside me by following me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Hearing those words, the female world spirit lowered her head. She finally began to carefully consider her situation.<br>Finally, she raised her head back up.<br>&ldquo;Very well, I will return to my world,&rdquo; the female world spirit said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng narrowed his brows. He sighed in his heart, &lsquo;Am I that unlikable? Why must you be so determined to either become an evil spirit or return to the Asura Spirit World, and not become my world spirit and serve me?&rsquo;<br>Although that was what Chu Feng was thinking, he did not reveal his thoughts. After all, he was capable of possessing a noble elegance.<br>&ldquo;Very well. You can return then. Once you return, I will immediately remove our contract,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I hope that you can honor your promise,&rdquo; as the female world spirit spoke, she stood up and walked into the world spirit gate.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, once the female world spirit entered the world spirit gate, the world spirit gate started to tremble violently.<br>Following that, a loud &lsquo;bang&rsquo; was heard. The world spirit gate actually shattered. Then, a figure landed in the location where the world spirit gate had shattered.<br>It was none other than that female world spirit.<br>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Chu Feng looked at the female world spirit with a confused look.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking me that? That&rsquo;s what I want to ask you. Exactly what are you trying to do?&rdquo; The female world spirit stared at Chu Feng with a furious expression.<br>&ldquo;What about me? If you don&rsquo;t want to return, then just say it forthrightly. Why bother doing such a thing?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Who said that I don&rsquo;t want to return? It&rsquo;s you instead. If you don&rsquo;t want me to return, then say it directly. Why go so far as to toy with me like that?&rdquo; The female world spirit became even more furious.<br>&ldquo;Who said that I don&rsquo;t want you to leave? I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Enough, forget about it. I&rsquo;ll do it myself.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng wanted to refute. However, he was stopped by that female world spirit with a gesture of her hand.<br>A world spirit could also open a world spirit gate to return to their own world at any time within a world spirit space. Merely, when a world spirit opened a world spirit gate, the world spiritist that it entered a contract with would be able to sense it. Only with the permission of the world spiritist would a world spirit&rsquo;s world spirit gate be able to open successfully.<br>Thus, what the female world spirit wanted was for Chu Feng to agree to her opening of a world spirit gate.<br>&ldquo;Very well, you do it then,&rdquo; Chu Feng gestured to her to do as she pleased.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The female world spirit did not hesitate. With a thought, she opened her world spirit gate. Then, without even bothering to look back, she entered it.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>However, another loud explosion was heard. The world spirit gate was shattered again, and the female world spirit returned to Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit space.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>The female world spirit became extremely furious from the successive failures.<br>Seeing that the female world spirit was looking at him with an incomparably furious gaze, Chu Feng hurriedly said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me. That world spirit gate was opened by you. What happened had nothing to do with me.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
