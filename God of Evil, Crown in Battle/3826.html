        <h1>Chapter 3825</h1>
        <div> - Seen Through<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Bastard! You dare hit me?! Do you know who I am?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Have you grown tired of living?!&rdquo;<br>After being injured, Meng Rufei was more furious than in pain.<br>He felt completely humiliated to be injured before the person he fancied. That was why he was so furious.<br>Chu Feng was the cause of it all.<br>&ldquo;I know who you are. You don&rsquo;t have to stress it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You merely need to know that, before me, you are trash like them." Chu Feng felt contempt and disdain towards the killing-intent filled Meng Rufei.<br>He simply did not care about Meng Rufei in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>Meng Rufei had wanted to say something. However, before he could say anything, a loud bang was heard, and Meng Rufei, who was sitting against the corner of the wall, was once again smashed ruthlessly into the wall.<br>It was Chu Feng. Like a phantom, Chu Feng had arrived beside Meng Rufei, grabbed him by the neck and pushed him up onto the wall.<br>&ldquo;I, Asura, am a reasonable person. I will not go out of my way to provoke anyone who doesn&rsquo;t provoke me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I&rsquo;ve already warned you. Thus, you&rsquo;d best understand your position.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I don't care who you have behind you. If you invoke my displeasure, I can take your life at any time.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng said those words in a very casual manner. However, his gaze was ice-cold and bone-piercing.<br>Meng Rufei was facing Chu Feng head-on. When he saw the gaze Chu Feng displayed, the anger in his heart was instantly extinguished. In fact, he felt a bone-chilling sensation all over his body.<br>Merely from that gaze, he was able to tell that this fellow by the name of Asura was not joking. He really would kill him.<br>&ldquo;Asura, don&rsquo;t you act undisciplined and out of control in this place just because your cultivation surpasses ours!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You need to know that Meng Rufei not only has an outstanding cultivation, but his world spirit techniques are also extremely powerful!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No matter how strong your cultivation might be, it is completely useless here! The only useful thing in this place are world spirit techniques!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a shout was heard. That shout had come from a fair-skinned man.<br>Ever since Chu Feng had taught Li Xiao a lesson, some people had been sending voice transmissions to Meng Rufei, asking him to teach Chu Feng a lesson.<br>As for that man, he was one of them. Furthermore, he was the most vicious of the bunch.<br>Chu Feng was able to hear all of their voice transmissions. Thus, he had heard all that he'd said to Meng Rufei.<br>That guy not only repeatedly asked for Meng Rufei to teach him a lesson, but he'd also cursed Chu Feng out in his voice transmissions. For the sake of getting Meng Rufei to attack Chu Feng, he even went as far as to frame Chu Feng, saying that he was extremely shameless, and had been staring at Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s butt the entire time.<br>&ldquo;Are you warning me?&rdquo; Chu Feng narrowed his brows and asked with a stern voice.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip; I am reminding you so that you know how capable you really are." That man had wanted to angrily denounce Chu Feng. However, he was terrified upon seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze, and greatly softened his ugly words.<br>&ldquo;Wuuah~~~&rdquo;<br>After that man spoke, Chu Feng waved his sleeve and sent forth a strong wind.<br>That man was sent flying. When he landed, his body was covered in blood. His injuries were even more serious than Li Xiao's and Meng Rufei&rsquo;s injuries. He ended up losing consciousness on the spot.<br>Even though he had already showed fear towards Chu Feng and changed his wording, he still ended up paying disastrously for his words.<br>&ldquo;Does anyone else want to remind me?&rdquo; Chu Feng swept his cold gaze over the remaining younger generations.<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The younger generations all turned away from his gaze. No one dared to respond to him.<br>As matters stood, they&rsquo;d become fully aware of how undisciplined and out of control that Asura fellow was.<br>After they personally witnessed the defeat of even Meng Rufei, they knew that that Asura fellow&rsquo;s cultivation was very likely rank two Exalted.<br>Among the people of the younger generation, a rank two Exalted would be a top level existence in the entire All-heaven Starfield.<br>Of course, there was another possibility: that Asura fellow was simply not a person of the younger generation.<br>The crowd all felt that the second possibility had a greater chance of being the truth.<br>After all, it was simply too difficult for a person of the younger generation to possess a rank two Exalted-level cultivation. The people that possessed that sort of cultivation were all extremely famous in the All-heaven Starfield. Yet, this Asura was someone that they&rsquo;d only just met, and had never heard of before.<br>&ldquo;That guy is most definitely not someone from the younger generation. Motherfucker! As a senior, he actually came here to bully us of the younger generation?! He&rsquo;s truly shameless beyond belief!&rdquo;<br>Thinking of that, the people of the younger generation present started feeling even greater hatred for Chu Feng.<br>Of course, they only dared to voice their hatred and displeasure in their hearts. On the surface, no one dared to go against Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, should I open the gate now?&rdquo; asked Fan Chou.<br>&ldquo;Brother Fan Chou, open the fourth gate," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Fang Chou did not hesitate. Holding the key, he walked to the fourth gate.<br>&ldquo;Clack~~&rdquo;<br>Right after the key was placed into the keyhole, the copper gate opened. Merely, before Fan Chou could pull the key out, the key turned into light and dissipated into nothingness.<br>Sure enough, it was as the crowd had guessed, they could only make a single choice.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the copper gate opened, and power akin to a tide rushed out of it.<br>The tide was composed of talismans. Those talismans squirmed as if they were alive.<br>The talisman power engulfed all the people of the younger generation, making them unable to move a single step.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is what happens when you refuse to listen to me.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a mocking laughter was heard. It was that Meng Rufei.<br>He thought that this was happening because Chu Feng had made the wrong choice. That was why he was ridiculing him.<br>The other younger generations also thought the same way as Meng Rufei. They all felt that Chu Feng had made the wrong selection.<br>At that moment, all sorts of curses towards Chu Feng were being spoken. Of course&hellip; those curses were spoken by the crowd in their hearts. No one dared to actually voice them aloud.<br>&ldquo;Why are you still not acting? Why bother wasting time?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded in Chu Feng&rsquo;s ear. That was a voice transmission. Furthermore, the person who spoke was Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Chu Feng looked to Yin Zhuanghong, and discovered that that cold and detached woman was looking at him.<br>&ldquo;How do you know that I can breach this formation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked using voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;I know who you are. You don&rsquo;t have to pretend anymore,&rdquo; said Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart tensed up. Then, he revealed a relieved smile.<br>Sure enough. In the end, he was still unable to keep things hidden from Yin Zhuanghong. It would appear that she had seen through him from the very start.<br></p></div>
