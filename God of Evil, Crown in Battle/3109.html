        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Battlefield<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Afterwards, Chu Feng began to ask the crowd about the origin of that monster in detail.<br>However, the crowd simply had no idea where that monster came from. The volcano had suddenly appeared out of nowhere. When it erupted, it was extremely spectacular.<br>Flames filled the entire sky, spreading out over ten thousand miles. It was even more astonishing than an abnormal sign.<br>However, the volcanic eruption did not cause any harm. It merely caught the crowd&rsquo;s attention and brought them there.<br>Thinking back to it now, the appearance of the volcano was indeed quite strange. The crowd also realized that the initial eruption of the volcano was a trap.<br>Seeing that the crowd also did not know where the volcano came from, Chu Feng had no choice but to investigate it himself. He entered the volcano again with the intention to investigate things.<br>Unfortunately, he was unable to discover anything.<br>That monster did not appear to have emerged from the depths of the earth. Chu Feng did not know exactly where it came from.<br>However, Chu Feng was worried about the safety of the people from the Holy Land of Martialism. As such, he advised them to not rashly enter another such &lsquo;sacred cultivation ground&rsquo; should they encounter another one in the future.<br>After all, there was no such thing as a free lunch, and meat pies would not fall from the heavens for no reason at all.<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng set up the same sort of grand defensive formations around the Cyanwood Mountain, the Elf Kingdom and the other powers.<br>He did that so that the people in the Holy Land of Martialism could take refuge in those places should they be met with a calamity in the future.<br>Although Chu Feng could not guarantee that the defensive formations he set up were capable of stopping all powerful enemies, they would at least be much more powerful than the defensive formations those powers set up themselves.<br>After Chu Feng finished setting up the defensive formations, he was finally able to relax. Chu Feng no longer busied himself with tasks, and began to properly accompany his family and friends of the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.<br>Chu Feng was actually very fond of being together with everyone.<br>His adoptive father was there, as were his masters, his brothers, his friends and a lot of close relatives.<br>Chu Feng would never forget the fact that those people had helped him in the past. He would never forget about the days when he had journeyed and fought shoulder-to-shoulder with those people.<br>That said, it remained that Chu Feng had a heavy responsibility, and could not stay for long. at that moment &hellip; it was still not time for him to enjoy life and peace.<br>Thus, after staying for a short couple days, Chu Feng decided to leave.<br>Everyone was there to see Chu Feng off. After bidding their farewells, and when Chu Feng was about to turn around to enter the Heavenly Road, Zhang Tianyi suddenly spoke.<br>He said, &ldquo;Junior brother Chu Feng, there is one thing that I wish to ask you about. Might you be able to answer me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior brother Zhang, what is it? You can ask away,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Junior brother Chu Feng, exactly what is your current level of cultivation?&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi asked.<br>Once Zhang Tianyi asked that question, everyone&rsquo;s eyes started to shine. What Zhang Tianyi asked was also what everyone wanted to know.<br>Chu Feng was slightly hesitant to answer Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s question. He felt that he would shock Zhang Tianyi should he inform him of his cultivation. After all, back then, Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s cultivation was about the same as Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>However, Chu Feng did not wish to deceive him and everyone else either. After all, they were all the people that he trusted the most, people that trusted him the most.<br>Thus, in the end, Chu Feng spoke the truth. He said, &ldquo;Rank six Heavenly Immortal.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rank six Heavenly Immortal?&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, he immediately caused a massive commotion among the crowd.<br>Even though the crowd was prepared, they were still tongue-tied with shock upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s answer.<br>During the last few days, the crowd had learned a lot about the Outer World from Chu Feng.<br>For example, they had learned about what sort of experts were present in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm and the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>They had also learned about the martial cultivation realms that they did not know about before.<br>Because of that, they knew very well what rank six Heavenly Immortal meant.<br>To them, True Immortal was already a cultivation realm that they would be unable to reach in their entire lifetime. As for Heavenly Immortal, and a rank six Heavenly Immortal on top of that, it was simply something that they could never even imagine.<br>&ldquo;Great! As expected of my disciple. I knew that you were definitely not someone at the bottom of a well. Judging from it now, this old man was not mistaken,&rdquo; Qiu Canfeng burst into loud laughter.<br>&ldquo;My brother is truly outstanding. You have truly not disappointed your big brother Monkey. Haha,&rdquo; Following him, Monstrous Monkey King also burst into loud laughter.<br>Afterwards, everyone else had joyous expressions on their faces. Chu Feng&rsquo;s adoptive father, his masters, his brothers and sisters were all praising Chu Feng.<br>Many people there had witnessed the time when Chu Feng was small and weak. Thus, they knew very well that Chu Feng had gone through a lot of difficulties in order to attain his accomplishments.<br>Furthermore, they felt very proud because Chu Feng was able to obtain such accomplishments.<br>That said, Zhang Tianyi had an extremely ashamed expression.<br>He was unable to help but remember that day, and the words he had said to Chu Feng.<br>A mere rank nine Half Martial Ancestor actually dared to boast that a rank six Heavenly Immortal was inferior to him. At that moment, Zhang Tianyi truly felt ashamed.<br>This was especially the case because his rank nine Half Martial Ancestor-level cultivation was something he had received from that monster.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for Chu Feng&rsquo;s prompt arrival and killing of that monster, Zhang Tianyi would not have even been able to maintain his rank nine Half Martial Ancestor-level cultivation.<br>Zhang Tianyi realized how enormous the disparity between him and Chu Feng was.<br>Chu Feng was no longer that young man from back then. The current Chu Feng was an enormous awakened dragon. Once he soared into the sky, he would never return.<br>&ldquo;Senior brother Zhang, little brother Wushang, if the two of you are willing, I can bring you two directly into the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are better cultivation resources there, and better cultivation environments,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Chu Feng wanted to help Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang. The reason for that was because Chu Feng knew that the two of them were the people with the greatest potential in the Holy Land of Martialism now that Xian Miaomiao had left. The two of them should not stay there forever.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, big brother Tianyi and I have actually already discussed this matter. Although the two of us have thought about going out and experiencing the world, after pondering it, we decided that the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm suits us better,&rdquo; Jiang Wushang said.<br>&ldquo;Junior brother Chu Feng, that is indeed the case. The two of us have decided to stay here,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi said.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you don&rsquo;t have to worry. Even though we&rsquo;re staying here, our cultivations will not become stagnant. After all, you&rsquo;ve left all those treasures and cultivation resources for us. Perhaps the next time you return, the two of us will have reached the Martial Ancestor realm,&rdquo; Jiang Wushang said with a smile.<br>Hearing what Jiang Wushang said, the crowd also nodded.<br>Chu Feng had indeed left a lot of treasures and cultivation resources with them. To Chu Feng, those things were useless. However, to Chu Feng&rsquo;s family and friends, they would provide enormous assistance.<br>The crowd all firmly believed that the treasures and cultivation resources that Chu Feng had left for them would be able to help them make progress in their cultivations.<br>&ldquo;I know you two can do it,&rdquo; A smile appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>Chu Feng actually really wanted to have Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang go out and see the Outer World. That said, he also respected their decisions. Thus, after finding out what they&rsquo;d decided to do, Chu Feng did not attempt to persuade them.<br>After that, Chu Feng bid farewell to the people present once again. Seeing those familiar faces, Chu Feng was truly reluctant to leave. However, after bidding farewell to them, Chu Feng still turned around resolutely and entered the Heavenly Road.<br>With a heavy responsibility on his back, Chu Feng had no choice but to leave.<br>It was as the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had said, to the current Chu Feng, his battlefield was no longer the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. In fact, his battlefield was not even the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>Instead, his battlefield was the entire Starfield, the entire Outer World.<br></p></div>
