        <h1>Chapter 785</h1>
        <div> - Reversing the Situation of the War<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the Eighth Immortal, a Martial King, furrowed his brows because of this sudden arrival. He cast his gaze at the end of the group of people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect, and said, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little Eighth of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, we haven&rsquo;t seen each other for just a dozen or so years yet you don&rsquo;t recognize the person who gave you pointers back in the day?&rdquo; Just at that moment, the space behind the army of the Crippling Night Demon Sect squirmed, and then a person appeared in everyone&rsquo;s line of sight.<br>He was an aged old man as well. However, looking at his appearance... it appeared he had lived for far longer&mdash;at least several hundred years&mdash;because his thin and dried-out body was akin to a corpse that had already entered the earth.<br>However, even though this old man was very old, he had an abnormally full and thick head of white hair. As he stood in the distance, he seemed like some sort of divine figure, emanating a feeling that he could not even be moved in the slightest.<br>He was not only a Martial King, he also wore the clothing of the Crippling Night Demon Sect.<br>After seeing this person, Old Liu and the others, who initially had expressions of panic, instantly rejoiced. They cried out simultaneously, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Earth King!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Earth King?&rdquo; Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help rejoicing inside as well when he heard those words, because he knew that the danger the Crippling Night Demon Sect was facing would be resolved soon.<br>In the days he had been in the Eastern Sea Region, Chu Feng had learnt quite a few things about the Crippling Night Demon Sect by inquiring on the side.<br>Back in the day, when the Crippling Night Demon Sect flourished, the strongest person was the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. He was the most powerful person in the Eastern Sea Region&mdash;this was something the public all agreed on. At least, before Huangfu Haoyue challenged him, he was the strongest.<br>After the extremely infamous sect head though, naturally the Four Protectors were the strongest. Within the Crippling Night Demon Sect, the Four Protectors had undoubtable position and strength. They were the four strongest other than the sect head.<br>And, when the members of the Crippling Night Demon Sect reached dozens of millions, other than the Four Protectors, there were actually many more powerful existences. Of them, the most notable were the Five Elemental Kings.<br>Gold King.<br>Wood King.<br>Water King.<br>Fire King.<br>Earth King.<br>Perhaps their strengths were inferior to the Four Protectors&rsquo;, but when the Crippling Night Demon Sect was thriving, they were already Martial Kings. Some of their names were known even earlier than the Four Protectors.<br>From Old Liu and the others, he learnt that the old man who appeared was the Earth King. Thus, Chu Feng naturally felt that the current danger had likely dissipated.<br>After all, the Earth King was different from the Eighth Immortal&mdash;he was a Martial King since many, many years ago. Likely, with his current fighting strength, he should be able to suppress the Eighth Immortal.<br>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s the Earth King. It&rsquo;s not that I didn&rsquo;t recognize you, it&rsquo;s just that having disappeared for so many years, and recalling your age as well, I thought you had already entered the coffin. Didn&rsquo;t think you were still alive.&rdquo; The Eighth Immortal oddly smiled. To the person who had gave him pointers before, he did not have a hint of gratitude or respect.<br>&ldquo;Haha, it&rsquo;s said that the Immortal Execution Archipelago rose in power only because others vanished, and the so-called experts of the Immortal Execution Archipelago are also despicable people who gained power. It looks like that is rather true.<br>&ldquo;But, I must admit that your Immortal Execution Archipelago&rsquo;s boot-licking skills are quite impressive. You&rsquo;ve really hid your strengths deeply.<br>&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t fawn over us so much back then, perhaps we would have already discovered that you were all so disgraceful and backstabbing. Lowly people like you should truly have been eradicated back then,&rdquo; said the Earth King with a sneer.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention past matters because you lack the strength now. If your Crippling Night Demon Sect truly is powerful, then why talk of ancient glories? How about you try destroying my Immortal Execution Archipelago now?&rdquo; the Eighth Immortal mocked, his face full of disdain.<br>&ldquo;Hmph. You truly think you can stand on even ground with me just by becoming a Martial King?<br>&ldquo;Today, I&rsquo;ll let you know how ignorant you are.&rdquo; At that instant, the Earth King was enraged. As he spoke, he disappeared in an instant. When he reappeared, he had already arrived before the Eighth Immortal.<br>*boom* He attacked. King-level Martial power was sent out, and even Martial Lords felt enormous pressure. The vast might of a Martial King was boundless.<br>&ldquo;Heh, I&rsquo;ll be honest, I truly don&rsquo;t put an old guy like you in my eyes right now. Your era has passed, and rather than letting you die from age, how about I end your journey here and send you off!&rdquo;<br>However, the Eighth Immortal was not the slightest bit afraid of the Earth King&rsquo;s attack. Instead, he started to uproariously laugh, and at the same time, released his King-level Martial power as well and fought the Earth King.<br>This Eighth Immortal had ambition that could touch the skies; he wanted the Earth King to be his stepping stone&mdash;he prepared to kill him, so his name would spread throughout the world.<br>&ldquo;Insolence.&rdquo; The Earth King naturally knew what he was thinking. So, he didn&rsquo;t hold anything back and every single strike aimed to take the Eighth Immortal&rsquo;s life away.<br>The confrontation of Martial Kings was indeed extremely terrifying. Let alone the devastating might, the shock waves alone were something the Martial Lords could not defend against.<br>&ldquo;Quick! Stay away from them! The Martial power of Martial Kings is too powerful. It&rsquo;s not something we can withstand!&rdquo;<br>At that very instant, no matter if it was the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago and Crippling Night Demon Sect who were fighting each other, or the people who were observing, they all quickly created some distance because the strength of the Eighth Immortal and the Earth King was really too horrifying. If they were dragged into that battle, they would definitely be injured if they didn&rsquo;t die.<br>&ldquo;The Eighth Immortal is this strong, so much that he can stand on equal ground with Lord Earth King?&rdquo; Seeing the fierce battle between the two people, which completely darkened the sky, Second Brother of the Gold-cloak Ten Brothers spoke in shock.<br>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not the Eighth Immortal who&rsquo;s strong, it&rsquo;s just that Lord Earth King is truly old. After all, his age&hellip;&rdquo; Old Liu helplessly shook his head and couldn&rsquo;t help but sigh.<br>&ldquo;Look, the Ninth Immortal is attacking the young ones!&rdquo; shouted Third Brother suddenly, his face full of worry.<br>When they looked over, they saw that the Ninth Immortal had indeed entered the circle of battle. He was currently massacring the experts of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. Even though they were all Martial Lords, the Ninth Immortal&rsquo;s fighting strength was extraordinary. Almost no one was able to defend against it.<br>He alone completely reversed the situation of the war. In but an instant, the over two thousand experts of the Crippling Night Demon Sect lost their advantage completely, and now, they were only on equal grounds with the experts of the Immortal Execution Archipelago despite their superior numbers.<br>&ldquo;Dammit! Quickly, we can&rsquo;t delay this any longer! Quickly open that place, otherwise everything will change!&rdquo; Old Liu finally hesitated no more. He turned around, and, still underground, headed towards the group of grand-looking buildings in the Depraved Ravine. Chu Feng and the others didn&rsquo;t dally either, and naturally closely followed.<br>Old Liu clearly knew the paths as they were underground&mdash;by his lead, they finally arrived before a palace door that was buried deeply. There seemed to be an extremely powerful Spirit Formation on the door, but Old Liu knew the method of deactivating it, and was able to easily do so.<br>Through the door, they walked into a vast underground palace. There were many mechanisms inside, and dangers truly lay in all directions. On the road, there were even countless Defensive Spirit Formations.<br>Luckily, Old Liu clearly knew everything. Everything was in his grasp, and all mechanisms and obstructions were broken through.<br>However, it appeared that deactivating those Spirit Formations wasn&rsquo;t easy either. After short moments of work, Old Liu&rsquo;s face had turned pale, and he was gasping for air. He looked as if he was about to fall at any moment.<br></p></div>
