        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Going To Lose?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a burst of applause stopped the crowd&rsquo;s discussions.<br>It was Wuming Doutian.<br>Wuming Doutian was actually applauding Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Truly a young hero.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If your father and grandfather could see your current accomplishments, they would definitely feel very proud.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Chu Feng, fist and feet do not have eyes. If you are to suffer injuries, you shouldn&rsquo;t say that I am bullying a youngster as an elder,&rdquo; Wuming Doutian said as he looked at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;The victor is king, and the loser is the thief. If I, Chu Feng, am to lose, I will not find a pretext for my defeat.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, if you are to lose, I will not make things difficult for you either. I will not expel you from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, from today on, your Wuming Clan must conduct yourselves properly in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, for I, Chu Feng, am not someone who will restrain myself out of politeness,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Haha. Not restrain yourself out of politeness? Well spoken indeed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son would be even more arrogant than him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. Allow me to experience whether Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son is as capable as him.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Wuming Doutian disappeared.<br>He had arrived before Chu Feng when he appeared again.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>He raised his hand and sent forth a palm strike at Chu Feng.<br>The palm strike was extremely fast. Furthermore, it was not aimed at Chu Feng&rsquo;s face, but rather his dantian.<br>That Wuming Doutian, although courteous in his speech, was not at all courteous in his attacks.<br>He was an extremely ruthless individual.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Facing Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s attack, Chu Feng merely let out a cold snort.<br>Then, his body shifted to the side slightly, and he easily dodged Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s attack.<br>A violent wind swept forth. Chu Feng raised his hand and shot a palm strike at Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s dantian.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm strike was much faster than Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s. Seeing the incoming palm strike, Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s expression took an enormous change. He immediately rushed backwards explosively.<br>After his rapid retreat, a black spear appeared in his hand.<br>It was an Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>After the Incomplete Exalted Armament appeared, Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s battle power immediately increased.<br>Most importantly, he swept the black spear in his hand through the air and sent out a burst of black gaseous flames from it.<br>The black flames wriggled around before turning into a ferocious giant beast that charged at Chu Feng.<br>Those were no ordinary gaseous flames. It was an Immortal Technique.<br>Although Wuming Doutian behaved like he took Chu Feng very lightly, he was actually very cautious.<br>When he'd first attacked Chu Feng&rsquo;s dantian, his attack was actually only a feint. He was trying to use that simple attack to judge his battle power.<br>When he discovered that Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm strike was faster than his own, he immediately revealed his Incomplete Exalted Armament to increase his battle power. Furthermore, he directly used an Immortal Technique.<br>He did all of that because he was afraid that he&rsquo;d lose to Chu Feng due to carelessness.<br>A golden light appeared before Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>A loud roar soared into the sky. A giant golden dragon flew out from the golden light.<br>The golden dragon opened its ferocious mouth and boundless suction rushed out from it. Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s Immortal Technique, that giant ferocious beast, was sucked into the golden dragon&rsquo;s mouth.<br>&ldquo;This brat.&rdquo;<br>Seeing his Immortal Technique being swallowed up by Chu Feng so easily, Wuming Doutian realized that the situation was very bad. After all, he had already used his Incomplete Exalted Armament, whereas Chu Feng had not.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re capable of, you&rsquo;ll truly disappoint me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come, stop being so overly careful. Go ahead and use whatever abilities you might possess,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng actually dared to provoke him, anger began to surge in Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Then, he increased the intensity of his attacks.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Explosions sounded in succession as energy ripples wreaked havoc.<br>The surrounding region was being fully affected by Wuming Doutian and Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle.<br>However, no matter how fierce the energy ripples were, they did not injure anyone present.<br>The reason for that was because those energy ripples were all contained.<br>&ldquo;Amazing. Chu Feng is simply too powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A demon level genius. This is what an actual demon level genius is like!&rdquo;<br>The crowd praised Chu Feng endlessly.<br>Even the people that had been insulting him earlier had begun to praise him.<br>There were also people who realized that the situation was bad, and immediately turned to flee.<br>The people that fled were those that had insulted the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Chu Feng earlier.<br>As for the reason they fled, it was because they all possessed limited cultivations.<br>Apart from the Wuming Clan&rsquo;s Six Great Utmost Exalted and the Dragon City Envoy that were Utmost Exalteds, the rest of the crowd were unable to even see a battle between rank one Utmost Exalted clearly, much less one between rank three Utmost Exalted.<br>In the end, the crowd was only there to enjoy the excitement, and nothing else.<br>They could only see and feel the intensity of the battle, but not grasp the details at all.<br>The battle between Chu Feng and Wuming Doutian had gotten extremely intense. Yet, the outcome of their battle was still undetermined. It seemed like they were on par with one another the entire time.<br>Thus, why were the crowd all praising Chu Feng and not Wuming Doutian?<br>One reason was because Wuming Doutain was an elder.<br>He had ruled over the Ancestral Martial Starfield for an extremely long time. He had cultivated for over ten thousand years.<br>In terms of seniority, Wuming Doutian had even higher seniority than Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandfather.<br>As for Chu Feng, he was a person of the younger generation that had not even reached a hundred years of age.<br>In terms of cultivation time, Wuming Doutian had cultivated for over a hundred times the length Chu Feng had.<br>With such an enormous difference in age, if the two of them were to tie, it would still mean Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s defeat.<br>After all, as Chu Feng continued to grow, he could surpass Wuming Doutian at any time.<br>The equilibrium would merely be temporary.<br>As for the other aspect, it had to do with the energy ripples wreaking havoc in the surroundings.<br>Those energy ripples did not cause harm to anyone present. The reason for that was because Chu Feng had used his own power to contain the energy ripples.<br>Although the crowd could not see the details of the battle, they were able to sense the intensity of the battle and the two fighters&rsquo; auras. Because of that, they knew that it was Chu Feng blocking the energy ripples.<br>As the saying went, 'a single mind cannot be focused on two tasks.'<br>This held even truer in a battle of life and death.<br>Yet, Chu Feng was using his own oppressive might to block the powerful energy ripples whilst fighting against Wuming Doutian.<br>This meant that he was fighting with a distracted mind.<br>Yet, even with that being the case, Chu Feng still wasn't at a disadvantage.<br>There could only be two reasons for this.<br>The first possibility was that Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength had surpassed Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s.<br>That was why he was able to easily fight Wuming Doutian and protect the crowd at the same time.<br>As for the other possibility, it would be that Wuming Doutian had not used his full strength, and was going easy on Chu Feng.<br>However, the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield all knew what sort of person Wuming Doutian was.<br>He was renowned for his viciousness and mercilessness. For the sake of eliminating threats, he was someone who would use any means necessary. He would even go as far as to eliminate potential threats by eliminating their entire clan or power.<br>After the Linghu Heavenly Clan left, the Chu Heavenly Clan had evidently become his greatest threat.<br>Now that he could openly eliminate Chu Feng, he would definitely not go easy on him.<br>Because of that, the crowd all felt that it was very possible that Chu Feng would emerge victorious in the battle.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the energy ripples wreaking havoc all around disappeared.<br>Then, Chu Feng and Wuming Doutian appeared before the crowd&rsquo;s eyes again.<br>However, when the crowd saw the two of them, they were shocked to discover that Wuming Doutian was not only completely unscathed, but he wasn&rsquo;t even panting.<br>He was still confident and at ease, still planning strategies against Chu Feng.<br>As for Chu Feng, not only was he gasping for breath, but he was also dripping with sweat. In fact, even the hand he held his weapon with was trembling violently.<br>This did not resemble a tie at all.<br>Could it be that Chu Feng was the one that would lose in this battle?<br></p></div>
