        <h1>Chapter 4449</h1>
        <div>: I Have Tried My Best<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whoosh!<br>Chu Feng immediately directed his blue lightning to ward off the punch from the lightning giant, but it was futile. His blue lightning was no match for the force the lightning giant commanded at all, and it dissipated without any resistance.<br>Not only so, but the fist was also still heading straight toward where Chu Feng was standing.<br>Seeing that the situation was not in his favor, Chu Feng quickly backed away, and he narrowly managed to dodge the attack.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what are you running for? Aren&rsquo;t you an almighty genius who mastered Soul of Heavenly within three days? What are you getting scared about? If you&rsquo;re a man, you should step forward bravely and fight!!!&rdquo; Yu Hong mocked loudly.<br>He had been feeling deeply stifled ever since the battle began as Yu Lie was outdone again and again. Now that Yu Lie finally managed to claim the upper hand, he was determined to make use of this opportunity to ridicule Chu Feng.<br>However, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t even be bothered to spare a glance at Yu Hong&rsquo;s shallow taunting. Instead, he looked at Yu Lie and smiled, &ldquo;Brother Yu Lie, don&rsquo;t hold back. Give it all you got.&rdquo;<br>The reason why he was saying this was because he had noticed that Yu Lie had held back a fair bit in the earlier attack.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I have not seen a single person in the Holy Light Galaxy who boasts greater talents than yours. I don&rsquo;t wish to harm you if possible. As long as you return the Exalted Taboos of our Yu Heavenly Clan, we can end this fight right here,&rdquo; Yu Lie said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Yu Lie, I&rsquo;ve already said that you should give it your all,&rdquo; Chu Feng repeated his words once more.<br>Seeing how unyielding Chu Feng was, Yu Lie sighed deeply, and a hint of viciousness flashed across his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, Brother Chu Feng, pardon me.&rdquo;<br>Boom!<br>The lightning giant raised his fist and struck down on Chu Feng once more. This time around, its speed and force were far stronger than before.<br>Just like what Chu Feng had said, Yu Lie had indeed been holding himself back, and he was only getting serious now.<br>However, what was surprising was that against Yu Lie&rsquo;s new wave of attack, Chu Feng actually showed no signs of dodging at all. Instead, he summoned his blue lightning once more and channeled it against the incoming fist of the lightning giant.<br>&ldquo;Has he gone mad?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even when Yu Lie wasn&rsquo;t using his full strength, he was already able to smash through Chu Feng&rsquo;s blue lightning with ease. Now that Yu Lie is finally using his full strength, Chu Feng still intends to use the same move against him? That&rsquo;s suicide!&rdquo;<br>There were many people who were getting cold sweat just by watching the scene. They could hardly comprehend the rationale behind Chu Feng&rsquo;s action at all.<br>Boom!<br>A reverberating explosion echoed, and the sky seemed to dim in this instant.<br>The full might attack of the lightning giant clashed with Chu Feng&rsquo;s blue lightning once more, but this time around, Chu Feng&rsquo;s blue lightning didn&rsquo;t dissipate.<br>Taken aback by the scene, the crowd quickly took a closer look, and their hearts jolted upon seeing what they saw.<br>Amidst Chu Feng&rsquo;s blue lightning, there was a small human silhouette. It was this human silhouette formed by the blue lightning that had stopped the ferocious punch coming from the lightning giant.<br>This was the profoundness of Soul of Heavenly Lightning, Lightning Soul!!!<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng actually managed to grasp the profoundness of Soul of Heavenly Lightning too?&rdquo;<br>Watching the small lightning figure standing against the towering giant, the crowd could hardly calm their hearts at all.<br>Following that, the small lightning figure began to grow at an exponential pace. In the blink of an eye, it had grown to a ten thousand meter tall giant that equaled Yu Lie&rsquo;s lightning giant in size.<br>Seeing such a sight, the crowd had no choice but to believe it to be true.<br>That was indubitably the ability of the profoundness of Soul of Heavenly Lightning.<br>Even Yu Lie couldn&rsquo;t conceal the shock he was feeling.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, it seems like I was still underestimating you. However, I have to win this fight regardless of the cost!&rdquo;<br>As Yu Lie said such words, his eyes suddenly turned frighteningly sharp.<br>Once again, he began forming a series of hand seals.<br>Tzlala!<br>Yet another powerful surge of blue lightning flowed forth from his body, and it swiftly morphed into the form of a human too.<br>&ldquo;Two Lightning Souls!&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing the formation of the second Lightning Soul, shocked exclamations sounded all around the place.<br>Even a single Lightning Soul was already a terrifying adversary to deal with, but wh could have thought that Yu Lie would actually still be able to form a second Lightning Soul?<br>This shouldn&rsquo;t have been something that a junior could pull off!<br>&ldquo;Yu Lie, you mustn&rsquo;t! Stop!!!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this sight, the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief shouted in alarm.<br>Initially, everyone was still perplexed as to why the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was stopping Yu Lie, but upon glancing over at Yu Lie, they found that the latter was bleeding from his seven apertures.<br>The truth immediately became apparent to them upon seeing this sight.<br>The formation of the second Lightning Soul was a huge burden to Yu Lie.<br>&ldquo;Grarrrr!&rdquo;<br>However, Yu Lie ignored the warning of the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and roared furiously instead.<br>His injuries were worsening with each passing moment. Cracks had begun appearing on his body.<br>Everyone could tell that at this rate, Yu Lie&rsquo;s soul could possibly dissipate into nothingness. Even in the most optimistic situation, he would be severely injured.<br>It was clear that Yu Lie was putting his life on the line for the second Lightning Soul.<br>&ldquo;Brother Yu Lie, stop.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice suddenly sounded.<br>Those words drew everyone&rsquo;s gazes toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s direction. They were curious to see if Chu Feng was going to admit defeat when faced with two Lightning Souls from Yu Lie.<br>However, it was completely different from what they thought, and it was obvious on sight.<br>This was because two more Lightning Souls had appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s left and right.<br>These two Lightning Souls had yet to expand, but it was without doubt that Chu Feng had indeed successfully formed them.<br>There was no point in Yu Lie pushing himself on anymore because Chu Feng was able to form three Lightning Souls simultaneously!!!<br>With this, the conclusion of the battle was already set.<br>Whoosh!<br>All of a sudden, the blue lightning around Yu Lie shattered as though glass shards, disappearing without a trace.<br>Not only did the second Lightning Soul dissipate, but even the first one was vanishing too.<br>Yu Lie was doing it on his own accord. He knew that there was no hope for victory against Chu Feng, so he decided to give up.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I, Yu Lie, have lost. My life is yours to take.&rdquo;<br>Yu Lie&rsquo;s voice was quivering with feebleness, but there wasn&rsquo;t any hint of weakness in his tone. He had no intention to plead for mercy, and it didn&rsquo;t seem like he feared death either.<br>&ldquo;Since your life is mine, you should live on properly then,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, not only was Yu Lie stunned, but even the others from the Yu Heavenly Clan was shocked as well.<br>Even the gazes which Yu Hong and Yu Yin were directing toward Chu Feng were slowly beginning to change.<br>They had never thought that the strong-willed and obstinate Chu Feng would choose to spare Yu Lie.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, are you certain that you want to spare me?&rdquo; Yu Lie asked.<br>&ldquo;Why would I kill you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;But if you have no intention of killing me, why did you accept my bet?&rdquo; Yu Lie voiced out his doubt.<br>&ldquo;I heard of your affairs, so I was interested in having a fight with you. From the very start, I had no intention of taking your life. However, what we have agreed on still holds true. Since I have won, I&rsquo;ll be taking everything in the Cosmos Sack with me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Yu Lie didn&rsquo;t respond to those words, and he didn&rsquo;t know what he should say either.<br>&ldquo;Our Yu Heavenly Clan aren&rsquo;t sore losers. Chu Feng, the Cosmos Sack is yours to take. Whether you intend to keep it for yourself or sell it out, our Yu Heavenly Clan won&rsquo;t interfere at all. We also won&rsquo;t pursue this matter any further,&rdquo; the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>As he said those words, he had already rushed over to Yu Lie&rsquo;s side to help him up.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, I&hellip;&rdquo; Yu Lie lowered his head in embarrassment.<br>&ldquo;Yu Lie, it&rsquo;s fine. We know that you&rsquo;ve tried your best.&rdquo;<br>There was no reproach in the eyes of the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief at all. All that could be seen in his eyes were just deep anguish.<br></p></div>
