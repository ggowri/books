        <h1>Chapter 1107</h1>
        <div> - Only One Lives<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>After fiercely glaring at Chu Feng with eyes filled with killing intent, Bai Ruochen slowly walked toward the wooden chest again.<br>However, right at this moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression took a huge, sudden change; he loudly shouted. &ldquo;Miss Bai, step back.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Bai Ruochen was confused by Chu Feng&rsquo;s sudden change. She turned around and stared at him blankly.<br>Seeing that Bai Ruochen did not step back, Chu Feng decided to take matters into his own hands. He stepped beside her, grabbed her wrist and began to run toward the entrance that they came in from.<br>&ldquo;What are you doing? Let me go.&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s sudden action brought alarm to Bai Ruochen, causing her to struggle furiously.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move. Follow me, we have to leave this place, it&rsquo;s dangerous here.&rdquo; Seeing her reaction, Chu Feng became worried; he shouted loudly at Bai Ruochen because he truly felt that a frightening power was currently being collected in the space around them.<br>Being shouted at by Chu Feng in such a manner, Bai Ruochen&rsquo;s frail body shivered. She stopped resisting and did not refute him either; obediently, she allowed Chu Feng to bring her toward the entrance without uttering a word.<br>&ldquo;Buzz.&rdquo; However, right when the two of them were about to reach the entrance of the tunnel, a light covered them from behind and sealed off the entrance completely.<br>&ldquo;What is happening?&rdquo; Seeing this, Bai Ruochen was even more shocked. At this moment, she finally realized something was wrong.<br>&ldquo;Damn it, we&rsquo;re still a step late.&rdquo; At this moment, Chu Feng frowned deeply. He turned around and cast his gaze deeply at the space that they fled from.<br>&ldquo;That is?&rdquo; Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s action, Bai Ruochen hurriedly turned around too. When she cast her gaze towards the deep space that they had fled from, her expression took a change for the worse.<br>That was because at this very moment, a spatial vortex had actually appeared in front of the wooden chest. The spatial vortex was surging and raging as it grew bigger and bigger. In the end, it turned into a colossal figure<br>It was a giant human-shaped figure of light. Not only did it possess facial features, it was even wearing an armor of light and holding an enormous blade of light. Its body was so large that its height numbered several hundred meters. Standing before Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen, it appeared like an unshakeable mountain. Conversely, Chu Feng and Bia Ruochen were as small as two little ants.<br>Most importantly, when this enormous figure of light appeared, an extremely frightening oppressive might also flooded the entire space. Before this oppressive might, not to mention resisting, Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen were unable to move even half a step. As if petrified, they stood in the air like stones. Other than being able to speak, the two of them were unable to do anything else.<br>This enormous human-shaped figure of light actually possessed a cultivation that could completely suppress both Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen -- Half Martial Emperor.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&rdquo;<br>That enormous human shaped figure of light first shouted a low roar. After that, it raised the enormous blade in its hand, instantly creating a strong gale. At this moment, the space that was previously flickering with light became frighteningly dark, as if they were in hell. Likely, if that enormous blade were to land, then Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen would be extinguished into nothing more than smoke.<br>However, to Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen&rsquo;s great surprise, that enormous figure of light actually spoke with a deep and resounding thunder-like voice. &ldquo;Of the two of you, only one may live. Whoever it is that says &lsquo;kill him&rsquo; first shall be allowed to live, and will obtain the Martial Skill.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will count to three. If no one speak first, then the both of you shall die.&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing those words, both Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen&rsquo;s expressions changed. What sort of situation was this?<br>A figure of light that the two of them were simply incapable of defeating wanted Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen to say such a thing. This was not as simple as having Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen kill each other, this was also a type of humiliation because it wanted them to, for the sake of protecting their own life, sacrifice the life of the other.<br>&ldquo;One.&rdquo;<br>However, that enormous figure of light did not give Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen any time to think at all. It began to count immediately. Furthermore, the voice it counted with was extremely loud and clear.<br>&ldquo;Stop! Who do you take us to be? We are the descendents of Senior Ouyang and Senior Baili. We have come here for the purpose of obtaining the remains of our ancestors. You cannot kill either one of us.&rdquo; Chu Feng explained. He wanted to test what sort of reaction that enormous figure of light would have.<br>&ldquo;Two.&rdquo; However, who would&rsquo;ve thought that the enormous figure of light would actually have no reaction at all.Completely disregarding Chu Feng&rsquo;s explanation, the enormous figure of light counted to two without the slightest hesitation.<br>&ldquo;Miss Bai, this is bad. That fellow is simply unable to comprehend our speech. It would appear that the two of us are fated to die here.&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to Bai Ruochen.<br>&ldquo;Who said that I will die with you here?&rdquo; However, who would&rsquo;ve thought that even with Chu Feng acting in such a sympathetic manner, Bai Ruochen would actually glance fiercely at Chu Feng. Her glance was so heartless and cold; it was as if Chu Feng would forever be unable to approach her.<br>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t possibly be wanting me to die, right? I fear it would be too late, he&rsquo;s going to count to three right away.&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed mischievously. It was as if death was not scary to him at all. At the very least, he did not fear death at this moment.<br>However, to Chu Feng&rsquo;s amazement, the enormous figure of light that was supposed to say &lsquo;three&rsquo; with a loud and clear voice did not say &lsquo;three.&rsquo; It was as if it was trying to deliberately give Bai Ruochen time to declare that she wanted Chu Feng to die.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng doubted that something was wrong with the enormous figure of light. After all, it was something formed by a formation array to begin with. It shouldn&rsquo;t be possible for it to actually possess intelligence. As for what it had said earlier, that ought to be something that was set in place by their ancestors.<br>However, when Chu Feng cast his gaze to the enormous figure of light, black lines came running down his head. On top of that, he felt full of grievances. That was because that enormous figure of light was actually not as simple as being silent. It was actually looking at Bai Ruochen. Furthermore, it simply appeared to be waiting for Bai Ruochen to declare that she wanted Chu Feng to die.<br>&ldquo;F*ck, bastard, you&rsquo;re truly too vile. You&rsquo;re truly shameless to the extreme. How badly do you want me to die? You actually deliberately gave Bai Ruochen the time to say those words.&rdquo; Unable to contain himself, Chu Feng cursed out with a loud voice.<br>Actually, it was not only Chu Feng. Even Bai Ruochen felt speechless. However, in the end, she did not say those words commanding Chu Feng&rsquo;s death, and continued to remain silent.<br>&ldquo;Three.&rdquo; Seeing this, the enormous figure of light was immediately filled with killing intent. At the same time, it began to slash downward with the enormous blade in its hand.<br>As soon as the enormous blade was slashed down, the dazzling light and the fierce killing intent also came crushing down onto the bodies of Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng felt like his brain had turned blank. After that, something rushed into his head. It was actually a map, a map of the Cyanwood Mountain.<br>The map clearly declared the hiding place of a certain object. However, it did not mention what that object was. However, Chu Feng subconsciously knew that it was most definitely an amazing item. At the very least, it should be a treasure.<br>Chu Feng carefully inspected the map in his mind. The more he inspected it, the more joy he felt. That was because this map meant that if he were to enter the Cyanwood Mountain, he would be able to search for the treasure on the map. This was truly an unexpected harvest. Or, in other words, the thing that was listed on the map should be what their ancestors had truly left behind for them.<br></p></div>
