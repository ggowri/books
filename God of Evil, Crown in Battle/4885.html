        <h1>Chapter 4884</h1>
        <div>: Baimei&rsquo;s Granddaughter?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng chuckled softly in the face of Shengguang Haoxuan&rsquo;s formidable attack.<br>Weng!<br>A bizarre sight occurred. The swipes that were directed toward Chu Feng suddenly froze in mid-air, shocking the crowd.<br>Shengguang Haoxuan desperately tried to will his swipes forth, but it was as if he had lost control of his martial power. He was unable to push the attack any further!<br>Shoosh!<br>While the crowd was still perplexed as to what was going on, the swipes suddenly reversed their direction and darted toward Shengguang Haoxuan.<br>This sight horrified Shengguang Haoxuan.<br>&ldquo;Break!&rdquo;<br>Sensing that the situation had turned awry, Shengguang Menglai quickly stood forward and released her rank three Martial Exalted level oppressive might, intending to neutralize the swipes. Yet, her effort proved to be futile.<br>For some reason, the swipes had grown far stronger as compared to when Shengguang Haoxuan released them at Chu Feng. Not even Shengguang Menglai was able to neutralize them.<br>These swipes didn&rsquo;t strike Shengguang Menglai. Instead, they circumvented her to strike Shengguang Haoxuan.<br>Pu!<br>Pu pu!<br>Pu pu pu!<br>Everything happened so quickly that no one other than Shengguang Menglai and Shengguang Xintian was able to see what had happened. By the time everything registered to them, Shengguang Haoxuan was howling on the floor with multiple glaring lacerations on his body.<br>&ldquo;What happened, young master Haoxuan?&rdquo;<br>The crowd rushed forward to check on his injuries.<br>Uwa!<br>However, Shengguang Haoxuan let out another anguished cry. As if someone was grabbing him by the throat, he was lifted up to mid-air. Those who tried to approach him were blocked off by an invisible power, unable to get close at all.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young miss Menglai, young miss Xintian, young master Chuyao, what&rsquo;s happening to young master Haoxuan?&rdquo;<br>It was such a sinister sight that it intimidated the junior prodigies of the HolyValley.<br>Shengguang Haoxuan was being lifted into mid-air without anything holding him. This supernatural occurrence was simply too frightening.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you behind this?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Menglai turned her eyes toward Chu Feng right away.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Chuyao was surprised to hear that.<br>Based on what he knew, Chu Feng shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to pose a threat to them.<br>&ldquo;Smart indeed, young miss Menglai.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng chuckled softly before turning to Shengguang Haoxuan.<br>&ldquo;I told you that trouble comes from the mouth, but you wouldn&rsquo;t listen to my advice. I&rsquo;ll drive it into your head so that you&rsquo;ll learn how to become a better person in the future!&rdquo;<br>A vicious glint flashed across Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Pu pu pu!<br>As if some sort of pressure was crushing down on Shengguang Haoxuan&rsquo;s body, he began spurting a huge amount of blood.<br>Gah!<br>Shengguang Haoxuan cried as miserably as his current state was.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, stop! We can always talk things out!&rdquo; Shengguang Chuyao tried to plead for mercy.<br>&ldquo;Since Brother Chuyao has spoken up on your behalf, I&rsquo;ll let you off.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng waved his hand.<br>Shoosh!<br>With a &lsquo;putong&rsquo;, Shengguang Haoxuan was tossed into the putrid lake and was swept away by the whirlpool.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Chuyao was rendered speechless. Even though Chu Feng said that he was going to let Shengguang Haoxuan off, his actions spoke a different story.<br>&ldquo;It was the waterfall that granted you power?&rdquo; Shengguang Menglai asked.<br>She was much calmer as compared to the other uneasy juniors.<br>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, this means that you knew that the waterfall was a cultivation spot, so you fooled us into thinking that it&rsquo;s dangerous there so that we wouldn&rsquo;t approach it. You made use of this opportunity to covet its power all alone,&rdquo; Shengguang Chuyao asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty much it. However, the waterfall isn&rsquo;t a cultivation spot. It only grants me power temporarily. This power can be used to help me, but it can be used to help the rest of you too. This power is necessary for the next part of our journey, and it&rsquo;ll be much more convenient if it&rsquo;s centered on a single person,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell us then? Why did you lie to us instead?&rdquo; Shengguang Chuyao asked.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chuyao, it should have been apparent to you how Shengguang Haoxuan was picking on me. If I had been honest, I wouldn&rsquo;t even have gotten a chance to enter the waterfall of light.<br>&ldquo;Besides, Shengguang Haoxuan&rsquo;s earlier attack carries killing intent. He was intending to take my life. Even if he didn&rsquo;t kill me with those swipes, there&rsquo;s no doubt that he isn&rsquo;t intending to let me walk out of here alive. I have no choice but to secure means to ensure my own safety. Otherwise, who am I supposed to count on? You all?<br>&ldquo;Earlier, when Shengguang Haoxuan made a move on me, none of you showed any signs of stepping forward to protect me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a sneer.<br>Those words rendered everyone speechless.<br>&ldquo;What about your glow then? Aren&rsquo;t you the one chosen by the Holy Lotus Tree?&rdquo; Shengguang Chuyao asked.<br>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s actually very simple. I fabricated it with my world spiritist technique in order to make my claim more convincing. Look.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, the glow appeared once more, only to vanish shortly after. It was clearly under Chu Feng&rsquo;s control.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; Haa!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Chuyao felt utterly helpless. He was angry and exasperated.<br>It infuriated him that he was being made a fool of by Chu Feng, but he wouldn&rsquo;t have been any wiser had Chu Feng not revealed the truth.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I think Shengguang Haoxuan was right. You&rsquo;re really bold,&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian suddenly spoke up.<br>&ldquo;Oh? Tell me more,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied calmly, unfazed by her remark.<br>&ldquo;Do you know who you have just thrown into the pond?&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian asked.<br>&ldquo;Is his name not Shengguang Haoxuan? Does he have another name?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you playing a fool? He&rsquo;s indeed called Shengguang Haoxuan, but he&rsquo;s a member of our HolyValley! He&rsquo;s not someone whom you can afford to touch!<br>&ldquo;The power you have obtained here might have been able to protect you for now, but will it protect you for life? For daring to lay your hands on a member of our Holy Valley, you&rsquo;ll be dead meat once we leave this<br>Lotus Tree!&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian threatened.<br>&ldquo;Woah, you&rsquo;re even making explicit threats now. Do you want to be thrown into that feces lake over there too?&rdquo;<br>An invisible force lifted Shengguang Xintian up to mid-air, till she was directly above the putrid yellow lake.<br>&ldquo;Let me down, Chu Feng! Do you know who I am?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xintian felt a little flustered, but more than that, she was enraged. When had she ever been humiliated in such a manner?<br>&ldquo;Of course I know who you are. Aren&rsquo;t you Shengguang Xintian? Apologize right now. If you do, I&rsquo;ll spare you in view of the hug you offered me earlier,&rdquo; Chu Feng teased the flustered Shengguang Xintian.<br>&ldquo;You scoundrel! My grandfather is Shengguang Baimei! He&rsquo;ll tear you to shreds if you dare to disrespect me!&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian hollered.<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Baimei is your grandfather?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in surprise.<br>&ldquo;Indeed! I am the sole granddaughter of Shengguang Baimei! My grandfather won&rsquo;t let you off if you dare touch me!&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian replied smugly.<br>&ldquo;I see. I&rsquo;m afraid that apologizing won&rsquo;t work for you then,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Ah? W-what do you mean?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xintian&rsquo;s eyes widened in horror. For a moment there, she even forgot to struggle. She subconsciously realized that something bad was going to happen.<br>&ldquo;What I mean is that I was just teasing you. I wasn&rsquo;t planning to really toss you in. However, since you&rsquo;re the granddaughter of Shengguang Baimei&hellip; down you go.&rdquo;<br>With another loud &lsquo;putong&rsquo;, Shengguang Xintian was dropped into the yellow lake.<br></p></div>
