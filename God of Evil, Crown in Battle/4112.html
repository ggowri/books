        <div> - Arrival Of A Celestial Fairy<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t compare yourself with the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Think about it, what is the name of this place?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is the Heaven-devouring Realm. This place&hellip; is the territory of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts,&rdquo; said the old granny.<br>&ldquo;But, since the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts are able to leave this place, we should definitely be able to do so too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At the very least there&rsquo;s a way out of here,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>However, the old granny shook her head at Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;Young man, since you&rsquo;ve entered this place, you should let go of everything from the past and start your life anew here. Do not think about leaving. After all, no matter how much you long to leave it will be futile. There is no way for you to leave this place.&rdquo;<br>As the old granny said those words, she began to walk outside with her hands behind her back.<br>&ldquo;Grandma,&rdquo; right at that moment a woman&rsquo;s voice sounded from outside the palace hall.<br>Then a beauty appeared from the sky and landed before the entrance.<br>As the entrance was open, Chu Feng was able to clearly see the appearance of that woman.<br>Clear eyes, delicate features and perfect curves.<br>The woman was extremely beautiful. She was simply excellent in every aspect. She simply did not resemble a woman that should be present in the mortal world.<br>She wore a long white skirt. The instant she landed from the sky, her long skirt fluttered in the air and made her appear like a celestial fairy descending onto the mortal world.<br>No, it wasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;appear like,&rsquo; but rather a celestial fairy in the flesh.<br>The aloof air she emitted was most definitely not something a person of the secular world should possess.<br>Her looks were simply devastatingly beautiful.<br>Although there was no lovely delight in her beauty, it was still enough to charm the masses.<br>Journeying from the Lower Realms, Chu Feng had seen countless beauties. But when he saw that woman, he was still profoundly attracted to her.<br>A beauty of her caliber was truly rare.<br>Her beauty was the sort that separated itself from the secular world.<br>She was truly a celestial fairy-like woman.<br>&ldquo;Ugly thing, so you&rsquo;ve returned,&rdquo; the old granny said as she looked at the beautiful woman.<br>&ldquo;Ugly thing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could this person be the hideously ugly granddaughter that granny spoke of?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt extremely shocked.<br>&ldquo;Grandma, why are you saying I&rsquo;m ugly again? The people outside all praise me as a celestial fairy,&rdquo; said the woman.<br>&ldquo;Celestial fairy? Your grandma in her youth was an actual celestial fairy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for you, you&rsquo;re extremely ugly. Make sure to stop going out too much so as to not bring shame upon me,&rdquo; the old granny said to the woman with a look of contempt.<br>Furthermore, she didn&rsquo;t seem to be joking around. Rather, she was extremely serious.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng realized that it wasn&rsquo;t the old granny&rsquo;s granddaughter that was incomparably ugly. Rather, it was the old granny who had a problem with her sense of beauty.<br>That said, it was clear that that woman had already grown accustomed to this sort of thing.<br>As such, she didn&rsquo;t take offense to her grandmother&rsquo;s behavior, and instead looked at Chu Feng. With a sweet smile she asked, &ldquo;When did you wake up?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Just now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thank you for rescuing me, young lady.&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it. My name is Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.&rdquo;<br>[1. Fumo means Demon Vanquish. The same as their clan name.]<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; that Fumo Xin&rsquo;er asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Chu Feng,&rdquo; replied Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng. That&rsquo;s a decent name.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, wait here for a bit. I have something that I need to talk with my grandma about.&rdquo;<br>As Fumo Xin&rsquo;er spoke, she arrived beside the old granny. She seemed to intend to take the old granny away.<br>However, the old granny shook off Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s hand and said, &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s something you want to say, just say it directly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Grandma, this concerns my big brother.&rdquo;<br>As Fumo Xin&rsquo;er said those words, she took a glance at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll excuse myself.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng was a sensible person, he decided to leave upon seeing that Fumo Xin&rsquo;er had something private that she wanted to talk about.<br>&ldquo;No need.&rdquo; However, before Chu Feng could leave the old granny actually grabbed him. She was indicating that he did not have to leave.<br>&ldquo;Ugly thing, if there&rsquo;s anything you want to say just say it directly,&rdquo; the old granny said to Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Grandma, I&rsquo;ve found some information about my big brother.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My big brother has fallen into a trap created by people from the Netherworld Ice Hall. He needs a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist to break the seal. If you don&rsquo;t come to his aid, my big brother will be done for,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;How many times have I told the two of you to not leave the sealed area?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet the two of you insisted on refusing to listen to me. Especially your brother, it&rsquo;s one thing for him to wander around, but why the heck did he decide to cause trouble for the Netherworld Ice Hall?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is that not courting death?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now that he&rsquo;s trapped he only has himself to blame. I will not save him,&rdquo; said the old granny.<br>&ldquo;Grandma, big brother is your biological grandson. He is the successor to our Demon Vanquishing Clan. Furthermore, he&rsquo;s without a son right now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he is to die, our Demon Vanquishing Clan&rsquo;s family line will come to an end,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er said worriedly.<br>&ldquo;With how much of a disappointment the two of you are, our Demon Vanquishing Clan&rsquo;s family line has long come to an end.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do not mention the matter about your brother again. If you are to mention it again, I will lock you away.&rdquo;<br>Surprisingly, the old granny was not only not moved by her granddaughter&rsquo;s pleas, but she instead became extremely angry. After saying those words, she soared into the sky and left.<br>&ldquo;Grandma, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er did not chase after her. Instead, she had a helpless look on her face.<br>&ldquo;Where is your big brother imprisoned?&rdquo; Chu Feng stepped forward and asked.<br>&ldquo;In the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s forbidden area,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;A Saint-cloak World Spiritist is all that&rsquo;s needed to rescue your big brother?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;They must be a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist,&rdquo; said Fumo Xing&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Let us go then. I should be able to help,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er looked at Chu Feng with an astonished look.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mess around. Judging from your age, you should be even younger than me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re both people of the younger generation; how could you possibly reach Dragon Mark Saint-cloak?&rdquo; Fumo Xing&rsquo;er did not believe Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that I can only rely on myself,&rdquo; as Fumo Xin&rsquo;er spoke, she soared into the sky with the intention to leave.<br>Her speed was extremely fast.<br>Chu Feng discovered that although she was a person of the younger generation, she actually possessed an Utmost Exalted-level cultivation.<br>Even though she was only a rank one Utmost Exalted, her cultivation was still extremely powerful for a person of the younger generation.<br>Seeing her leave, Chu Feng also soared into the sky and flew after her.<br>He could tell that Fumo Xin&rsquo;er cared deeply about her brother&rsquo;s life.<br>As he owed her a favor for saving his life, he would definitely help her out if he could.<br>&ldquo;You actually managed to catch up to me?&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was very surprised to see that Chu Feng had actually caught up to her.<br>&ldquo;Whilst my cultivation is inferior to yours, I am still a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I possess strength on par with an Utmost Exalted,&rdquo; as Chu Feng spoke, he released his spirit power.<br>Seeing the Dragon Mark Saint-level spirit power emitted by Chu Feng, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was so shocked that her mouth hung wide open.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re actually really a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Amazing. It&rsquo;s no wonder that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast went as far as to leave this Heaven-devouring Realm to devour you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is great. That stinky brother of mine will be saved now.&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was overjoyed.<br>&ldquo;Went as far as to leave the Heaven-devouring Realm? What do you mean by that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that the Heaven-devouring Beasts need to pay some sort of price in order to leave the Heaven-devouring Realm?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind fixed onto the words Fumo Xin&rsquo;er had spoken inadvertently.<br>&ldquo;Of course. They&rsquo;ll have their lifespan shortened,&rdquo; said Fumo Xing&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Lifespan shortened?&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed a pensive look.<br>&ldquo;Why are you so concerned about this? You couldn&rsquo;t possibly be thinking about leaving this place, right?&rdquo; asked Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Of course. My family and friends are all out there,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s simple then. If you want to leave, I can help you,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;You can help me?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression grew complicated.<br>The old granny had said that it was impossible for him to leave. Thus, why would her granddaughter say that she could help him leave?<br>Exactly which of them was lying to him?<br></p></div>
