        <h1>Chapter 3104</h1>
        <div> - I Have My Means<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior brother Zhang, although I address you as my senior brother, I respect you as an older brother in my heart.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The two of us have experienced tribulations of life and death together. How could you not know what sort of person I, Chu Feng, am?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Zhang Tianyi.<br>&ldquo;I naturally know what sort of person you are. However, the person I know was the you from the past.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;People change. As you ascend higher and higher and discard us far behind you, truth be told, I started to gradually feel as if I no longer know you as well.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At the same time I felt the sense of distance from you, I also felt a sense of unfamiliarity,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi said.<br>&ldquo;Regardless of what you say, I am determined to destroy that volcano. I cannot allow you all to be in danger without doing anything,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well, since you are so determined to destroy the Sacred Mountain, I will give you two choices,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi said.<br>&ldquo;What are your two choices, go ahead and tell me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;First, it is fine for you to destroy the Sacred Mountain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you must do so over my dead body. Unless you are to kill me, I will not let you destroy the slightest bit of the Sacred Mountain,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You know that I couldn&rsquo;t possibly kill you,&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed a wry smile.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you know you couldn&rsquo;t kill me. Not to mention not killing me, the current you would find it difficult to even injure me.&rdquo;<br>Not only was Zhang Tianyi extremely confident when he said those words, but he was also extremely arrogant. It was as if he had already verified Chu Feng to be inferior to him.<br>Hearing those words, the wry smile on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face grew more intense.<br>Even though Chu Feng knew that the current Zhang Tianyi was extremely irrational, that his head had been muddled by greed, that he was affected by that volcano, it remained that Zhang Tianyi was a brother that he had gone through trials and tribulations with.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng felt sadness in his heart.<br>&ldquo;That guy is too arrogant. A mere rank nine Half Martial Ancestor, does he really think himself to be invincible in the world?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Some trash of that cultivation, not to mention the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, there should be a lot of people that could take care of him even in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, teach him a lesson. Beat him awake and have him know how small and weak he really is.&rdquo;<br>Compared to Chu Feng&rsquo;s sadness, Her Lady Queen became very angry. She was itching to have Chu Feng teach Zhang Tianyi a proper lesson, and make him realize how enormous of a disparity there was between him and Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to beat him awake. Furthermore, I would never attack him because of something like this,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s your plan? Are you perhaps planning to accept all his insults and slander without doing anything?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you do not defend yourself, wouldn&rsquo;t all that he said become true?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, don&rsquo;t worry, I have my means,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>After that, Chu Feng asked Zhang Tianyi, &ldquo;In that case, I wish to know what the second choice is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The second choice,&rdquo; hearing till this point, Zhang Tianyi revealed an embarrassed expression. However, in the end, he clenched his teeth and spoke. However, his voice was not as stern and forceful as before. Instead, one could even hear traces of shame and guilt in his voice.<br>&ldquo;Junior brother Chu Feng, I think that it is better for you to return to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. This place no longer belongs to you. As for the things here, you do not have to concern yourself with them anymore.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not mentioning the fact that the Sacred Mountain is not as you said it to be, even if it is, it is our choice. Our lives and deaths have nothing to do with you,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Father, is that also what you&rsquo;re thinking?&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to his adoptive father.<br>&ldquo;Feng&rsquo;er, your father would naturally not think that way. Regardless of how far away you go, I, your father will always believe that you belong to this place, that this place is your home.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, what Tianyi said is also not without reason. It is all thanks to that Sacred Mountain that we were able to make so much progress in our cultivations. We also did not discover the danger that you speak of.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, Feng&rsquo;er, could you be overthinking things?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s adoptive father asked.<br>Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s adoptive father&rsquo;s attitude was extremely good, and he was even trembling in fear of angering Chu Feng, one could tell from his tone that he too did not wish to believe that there was a problem with the Sacred Mountain.<br>&ldquo;In that case, Master, seniors, do you all also feel that I am deceiving you all?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned his eyes to Qiu Canfeng and the others.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re overthinking things. How could we possibly think that you&rsquo;re deceiving us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Chu Feng, you cannot think that way.&rdquo;<br>The crowd all began to explain to Chu Feng that whilst they did not think that Chu Feng was deceiving them, they too felt like his adoptive father, and believed that there was no problem with the Sacred Mountain<br>&ldquo;I understand now,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled and nodded.<br>&ldquo;Junior brother Chu Feng, if Wushang and I are to enter the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm one day, we will go and find you. If you are in trouble, we will help you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No matter how you treat us, no matter what you think of us, in our hearts, you will always remain our brother. If you are in trouble, even if we are to risk our lives, we will still be willing to help you,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi added.<br>&ldquo;Senior brother Zhang, thank you for considering me as your brother. Since you will not abandon me, I too will not abandon you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, you&rsquo;re determined to destroy the Sacred Mountain, to fight against me?&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi asked.<br>&ldquo;No, I will wake you up,&rdquo; after Chu Feng finished saying those words, he soared into the sky and left.<br>At that moment, Xian Lingyue pointed to Zhang Tianyi and shouted angrily. &ldquo;Zhang Tianyi, you are too excessive!&rdquo;<br>Following her, many other people also stood forth and began to reprimand Zhang Tianyi.<br>&ldquo;Even without everyone telling me, I know very well that my words were excessive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Chu Feng wanted to destroy the Sacred Mountain, ruin our shortcut to continue to increase our cultivation. Are you all willing to have that happen?&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi asked.<br>At that moment, many people closed their mouths. That was because they were truly unwilling to accept it.<br>That was also the reason why no one stood forth to speak for Chu Feng when he was being verbally attacked by Zhang Tianyi.<br>Zhang Tianyi was not the only one that was affected by the volcano. Likewise, Zhang Tianyi was also not the only avaricious person among the crowd.<br>Among all the people present, very very few among them were actually awake.<br>The crowd all felt that Chu Feng had already left.<br>However, they had no idea that Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t leave. Instead, he had entered the volcano, and was flying deep into its depths.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you planning to destroy this volcano?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;If I am to destroy it, they will really end up hating me. Furthermore, that sort of hatred is extremely difficult to remove,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, you should&rsquo;ve properly taught that Zhang Tianyi a ruthless lesson just then. Have him understand how powerful you are, and become aware that what you said earlier was the truth. With how much more powerful you are, how could you possibly envy his mere bit of cultivation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After you reveal how powerful you are, they will naturally believe you,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br></p></div>
