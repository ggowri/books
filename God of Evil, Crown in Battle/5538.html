        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Long Chengyu walked back the same road he came from and soon returned to the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s warship. The first thing he did upon returning was to look for his father.</span><br><span>Soon, he found his father inside a hall together with Long Xu and Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span>.</span><br><span>His father had an awfully livid expression, and his killing intent surged in the hall. Long Xu and Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> had heavy expressions that reflected their unease too.</span><br><span>Clearly, the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had heard about what they had encountered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re back?&rdquo; Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> noticed Long Chengyu and asked.</span><br><span>The first thing she did upon returning was to look for the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, so she didn&rsquo;t know about the return of the other Totem Dragon Clansmen, who had entered the spirit formation gate leading to the Immemorial Star Sea together with Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big sister, the spirit formation gate doesn&rsquo;t lead us straight to the Immemorial Star Sea but a passageway&hellip;&rdquo; Long Chengyu shared what they had faced after entering the spirit formation gate.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It looks like young friend Chu Feng wishes to leave his name on the Immemorial Star Sea&rsquo;s stone monument,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief suddenly spoke up. His complexion had alleviated from before, and his tone sounded normal.</span><br><span>He was the patriarch of a powerhouse, after all. The least he could do was to control his emotions no matter what happened.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng said that there&rsquo;s a reason he needs to enter the Immemorial Star Sea, but he didn&rsquo;t specify what it is,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng sure is a mysterious one. I reckon that even </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> will struggle to keep her name on the stone monument given her talents. Speaking of which&hellip;&rdquo; The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief suddenly paused and let out a sigh. &ldquo;We have to thank young friend Chu Feng for saving you once again.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;The debt we owe him just keeps growing larger. If not for him, we&rsquo;d have all died inside there,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>Even now, he still felt frightened thinking about what a close shave they had. Their fates were already sealed from the moment they entered the realm. They would have all died if Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t entered the realm, deciphered the compass, and protected them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chengyu, it&rsquo;s my fault. I nearly led you to your deaths,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief apologized.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t say that, father&hellip; but how do you intend to deal with this matter?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Chengyu didn&rsquo;t bother asking whether his father knew about the existence of the Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clan beforehand, for he knew that his father would have never allowed them to enter the realm and work with them otherwise.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll demand an explanation from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. How dare they make a fool of us? They are looking down on us!&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief bellowed.</span><br><span>Shoosh!</span><br><span>A beam of light suddenly shot into the hall. The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief caught the light with his hand, and geographical coordinates flowed into his mind.</span><br><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master had sent him a location.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He still dares to look for me after what he has done?&rdquo; The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up as his anger flared once more.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, I&rsquo;ll come with you,&rdquo; Long Xu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;No need. I&rsquo;ll suffice,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said before flitting off.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Long Xu.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Chengyu and Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> looked at Long Xu with worried faces, knowing that neither the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion nor its Mansion Master was easy to deal with.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Our clan chief knows what he&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; Long Xu consoled them with a smile.</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief soon arrived in a cloudy area not too far away from the Immemorial Star Sea. There was not a single person to be seen in the vicinity. He was at the location the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master had sent him.</span><br><span>But as soon as he took a step forward, he bumped into an invisible barrier. Three figures appeared before his eyes.</span><br><span>One of them was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master.</span><br><span>The other two were unfamiliar faces, but it wasn&rsquo;t hard to figure out their identities. One of them was a Totem Phoenix Clansman, whereas the other was a Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clansman. Both of them were formidable experts.</span><br><span>The Totem Phoenix Clansman had a furious expression despite his best attempt to suppress his anger. In contrast, the Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clansman was relatively composed. Without a doubt, the three of them must have been discussing the assimilation formation prior to his arrival.</span><br><span>The Totem Phoenix Clansman was probably furious because he didn&rsquo;t know that this was a suicide mission that doomed his clansmen. It was perplexing to see how composed the Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clansman was, but the chances were that he either knew the truth beforehand or that he was unconditionally loyal to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, such that he wouldn&rsquo;t kick up a fuss even though this matter had caught him by surprise.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master, you sure have many tricks up your sleeves. Were it not for this incident, I would have never known that the Totem Phoenix Clan and the Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clan are under your protection,&rdquo; the Totem </span><span>Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief sneered.</span><br><span>Unfazed by his sarcastic remark, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said, &ldquo;Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, you arrived just in time. Allow me to introduce you to the Totem Phoenix Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief waved his hand and bellowed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested to know who they are. All I want to know is why you betrayed my trust and made me send my son and daughter to their deaths. I didn&rsquo;t hesitate to offer you a helping hand when you requested my help, but I never thought that you would be so vicious as to plot against my descendants!&rdquo;</span><br><span>His deafening voice shook the concealment formation so much that it looked as if it would shatter at any moment, but the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master remained unfazed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The two of you should head back first,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said with a wave of his hand.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Mansion Master, I&rsquo;ll be taking my leave.&rdquo; The Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief respectfully bowed to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master before taking his leave.</span><br><span>The Totem Phoenix Clan turned around and left without saying a word. As infuriated as he was, he dared not to disobey the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master.</span><br><span>In the blink of an eye, the only ones left in the vicinity were the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master and the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I was fooled as well. I didn&rsquo;t know it was an assimilation formation. Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, you should know what kind of person I am. I wouldn&rsquo;t have sent anyone into the formation if I had known that it was an assimilation formation, let alone Chengyu and the others,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master explained.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief sneered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me that you didn&rsquo;t know? You, who only makes a move when you&rsquo;re certain of success? The Immemorial Star Sea is a trial for the juniors. How did you even find out about the formation there? You better give me a satisfactory explanation today, or else&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>Before he could finish his words, the face of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master suddenly turned cold. &ldquo;Or else what?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>A surge of intimidating oppressive might rippled from the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, instantaneously tearing about the concealment formation and enveloping the entire Immemorial Star Sea.</span><br><span>Dragon roars resounded in the sky, though the crowd couldn&rsquo;t tell where it was coming from.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This oppressive might&hellip; Is that the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The tremendous oppressive might was so powerful and unique that the crowd had no doubt who it was from. Unlike the crowd, who didn&rsquo;t know better what was going on, the Totem Dragon Clansmen on the warship nervously clenched their fists.</span><br><span>They already knew what was going on, which was why they were worried.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Father&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>Even Long Chengyu and Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> could hardly conceal their nervousness.</span><br><span>Yet, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master, despite being in proximity to such terrifying oppressive might, showed no fear whatsoever. Instead, he burst into laughter.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, are you certain you want to make a move on me? I advise you to think thrice,&rdquo; said the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master as he stepped forth and lightly patted the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s shoulder.</span><br><span>This light pat caused the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s face to stiffen. A hint of fear flickered across his livid eyes.</span></p></div>
