        <h1>Chapter 5303</h1>
        <div>: The Red Gate Feared By Prodigies<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll begin if you&rsquo;re ready,&rdquo; the elder from the Ancient Realm said.<br>The ancient wooden gate creaked open, revealing eleven smaller gates within. Ten of the gates were white and neatly lined up in a row. The final gate was larger and red in color, as if signaling danger, and it floated above the others.<br>It was obvious that the larger red gate was the more difficult second test.<br>All eleven of the gates were fully opened.<br>Whoosh!<br>Everyone who had an invitation letter in hand rushed into the wooden gate, but there were two individuals who were exceptionally fast. Just as everyone barely started moving, the two of them had already arrived before the red gate.<br>These two individuals were juniors.<br>One of them was a suave man dressed in the blue robes of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect.<br>The other one was a man dressed in the grayish-black robes of the Bluemoon Sacred Sect. He was indescribably handsome, even when compared to the suave man from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect. The only shortcoming in his appearance was his ghastly pale skin.<br>The other was dressed in grayish-black garments.<br>The two of them simultaneously stopped before the red gate and exchanged glances before making a detour toward one of the white gates beneath.<br>&ldquo;Why did they give up?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was baffled. It was intriguing how the two of them were clearly intending to challenge the second test, only to suddenly give up without trying.<br>Shoosh!<br>Another individual flitted toward the red gate. He was from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.<br>&ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s Jia Chengying!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he the number one junior of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect? What is he doing here?&rdquo;<br>A huge commotion broke out amidst the crowd. They were more familiar with Jia Chengying than the two juniors from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect and the Bluemoon Sacred Sect. After all, he was the most talented individual from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.<br>However, Jia Chengying also revealed a hesitant frown as soon as he arrived before the red gate. In the end, he turned around and headed toward one of the white gates beneath.<br>&ldquo;Jia Chengying gave up too?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is there more to the red gate than what we see?&rdquo;<br>The fact that the three prodigies chose to avoid the red gate without entering it showed that there was something peculiar about it.<br>Amidst the crowd, Bai Yunqing looked at the red gate with a conflicted look. He was tempted to try the red gate and make a name for himself, but he didn&rsquo;t want to become an embarrassment. He knew that there must be a reason why the three prodigies were deterred by the red gate.<br>In the end, he decided to head toward one of the white gates too. He thought that it was better to be safe than sorry.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t well-known despite being the disciple of the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s First Guest Elder, so his appearance didn&rsquo;t cause much of a stir.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, which gate are you planning to head into?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the white-haired woman.<br>&ldquo;You need not follow me. Head wherever you want.&rdquo;<br>Shoosh!<br>The white-haired woman dashed straight for the red gate. She moved at such a quick speed that none of the juniors noticed her, but her movement didn&rsquo;t elude the notice of the elders. Those elders showed shocked expressions.<br>This was especially so for Mo Wuxiang. He knew that Jia Chengying was a competitive individual who wouldn&rsquo;t give up as long as there was a fighting chance. In other words, Jia Chengying must have deemed the red gate to be too dangerous for him to conquer.<br>It was astonishing that the white-haired woman dared to challenge a test that even Jia Chengying had given up on. She must either be powerful or have a loose screw. However, judging from her movement speed earlier, she was clearly a prodigy too.<br>&ldquo;Could the white-haired woman be the one who defeated our young master in the Trial of the Strongest&rsquo;s early Half-God level category?&rdquo; Mo Wuxaing wondered.<br>Meanwhile, the crowd had finally arrived before the massive wooden gate. Some of them were blocked by an invisible barrier before they could even get close. Those were the ones who were trying to sneak in despite not having an invitation letter.<br>They backed off in embarrassment upon being discovered, and the elder from the Ancient Realm didn&rsquo;t punish them either. Instead, he assessed the situation below.<br>Whoosh!<br>A cry of exclamation sounded from the crowd.<br>Yet another person had appeared in front of the red gate. It was none other than Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I miscalculated. I didn&rsquo;t think that there is a formation here,&rdquo; Chu Feng muttered in embarrassment.<br>He was planning to slip in without anyone noticing, but his concealment formation broke as soon as he approached the red gate. Some sort of power that unraveled formations was shrouding the red gate, but he failed to notice it earlier.<br>He finally understood why the prodigies from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect and Bluemoon Sacred Palace had backed off from the red gate. Now that he was standing before the red gate, he could feel an immense pressure crushing down on his soul. It was such a powerful force that it felt like he would implode.<br>&ldquo;How aren&rsquo;t you moving? Just say so if you&rsquo;re scared. Why put on this act?&rdquo; a voice echoed behind Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng turned around and saw a man dressed in the robes of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect heading his way.<br>The man had a youthful appearance that looked to be around Chu Feng&rsquo;s age. He emanated the aura of a rank eight Martial Exalted level cultivator despite his young age, indicating that he was a talented individual. However, he looked at Chu Feng with eyes filled with contempt despite it being their first meeting.<br>The unfounded hostility irked Chu Feng. He had never liked those who looked down on others for no good reason.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jia Chengxiong!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Jia Chengying&rsquo;s younger brother is here too?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Jia Chengxiong is thirty years younger than Jia Chengying, but his cultivation has already reached rank eight Martial Exalted level! Can you imagine just how talented he is? It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before he becomes a powerhouse of our Totem Galaxy!&rdquo;<br>Compliments could be heard from the crowd. There were even some young women cheering in the background. Jia Chengxiong looked to be very popular, just like his older brother.<br>Jia Chengxiong only became even more arrogant upon hearing the compliments.<br>&ldquo;Get lost if you aren&rsquo;t going to enter. Don&rsquo;t block my way.&rdquo;<br>Jia Chengxiong began making his way toward the red gate, but his footsteps abruptly halted when he arrived at where Chu Feng was standing. At the same time, his complexion paled. He had finally felt the terrifying aura that crushed the soul coming from the red gate.<br>&ldquo;Why did you suddenly stop walking?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of your business,&rdquo; Jia Chengying scoffed.<br>&ldquo;Just say so if you&rsquo;re afraid,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Afraid? Hah! Do you think that I, Jia Chengxiong, would be afraid?&rdquo; Jia Chengxiong replied with a voice dripping with disdain, but he subconsciously took a step back from the red gate.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment, why does that person look so familiar? He&hellip; Is he Chu Feng?&rdquo; a woman in the crowd pointed at Chu Feng and exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;Who is Chu Feng?&rdquo; someone else asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the guy who won first place for the Trial of the Strongest&rsquo;s late Martial Exalted level category!&rdquo; the woman said.<br>&ldquo;The champion of the Trial of the Strongest&rsquo;s late Martial Exalted level category?!?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Holy! That does seem to be him. He&rsquo;s really here!&rdquo;<br>A commotion even larger than when Jia Chengxiong made his appearance broke out. The juniors in the crowd looked at Chu Feng with heated eyes, and the women began cheering aloud. Some even declared that they would bear Chu Feng&rsquo;s children.<br>&ldquo;Wow! Your name has really spread far and wide on the Totem Galaxy. It looks like you haven&rsquo;t joined the Trial of the Strongest in vain. Those women over there are looking at you with glowing eyes. You should quickly look around and see if you fancy any one of them. You can start building your harem now,&rdquo; Eggy said excitedly.<br>Chu Feng was surprised by the situation.<br>He had known that his reputation would soar after his victory at the Trial of the Strongest, but he didn&rsquo;t expect his name to spread that quickly. He also didn&rsquo;t think that he would be so warmly received by others.<br>&ldquo;You are Chu Feng?&rdquo; Jia Chengxiong looked at Chu Feng in a different light.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;The one who won the Trial of the Strongest&rsquo;s late Martial Exalted level category?&rdquo; Jia Chengxiong asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>Shrill screams echoed from the women in the crowd. Chu Feng&rsquo;s acknowledgment of his identity had further excited them. Some of them even started sending him messages via voice transmission to express their lust for him.<br>&ldquo;The woman of the Totem Galaxy sure are open-minded.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng thought to himself&hellip; until he realized that there were men expressing their affection for him too.<br>&ldquo;It really is you. I was still thinking that you&rsquo;re some nameless junior, but it turns out that you&rsquo;re the strongest late Martial Exalted level cultivator. How formidable. Do you dare to enter the red gate?&rdquo; Jia Chengxiong sneered.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t happy that Chu Feng&rsquo;s reputation surpassed his.<br>&ldquo;Do you dare?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I dare if you dare,&rdquo; Jia Chengxiong replied.<br>&ldquo;Whoever backs down will have his descendants cursed with infertility,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied before walking in.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>Jia Chengxiong was stunned. He had provoked Chu Feng thinking that the latter wouldn&rsquo;t dare to enter the red gate, only to be proven wrong right after. How could Chu Feng dare to enter a place where the prodigies of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect and Bluemoon Sacred Palace and his older brother shied away from?<br>&ldquo;Is he not afraid of death?&rdquo; Jia Chengxiong exclaimed.<br>His complexion was so awful that it looked almost as if someone had stuffed poop down his throat. He turned around and saw the crowd staring at him intently, waiting to see whether he truly dared to enter the red gate.<br>If he backed down now after his earlier confrontation with Chu Feng, he would never be able to raise his head in the Totem Galaxy anymore!<br>&ldquo;Damn it! Who&rsquo;s afraid of who?&rdquo; Jia Chengxiong mustered his courage and entered the red gate.<br>Meanwhile, more people had made their way toward the red gate, only to be deterred by the tremendous pressure that threatened danger. Through them, the crowd finally learned why the earlier prodigies had decided not to enter the red gate.<br>At the same time, this brought them newfound respect for Chu Feng and Jia Chengxiong.<br>However, a few seconds later, Jia Chengxiong suddenly rushed out with his body drenched his cold sweat. Even his knees were knocking against each other. It looked almost as if he had just suffered the scare of his life.<br></div>
