        <h1>Chapter 4559</h1>
        <div>: The Strongest Expert in the Galaxy<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hu!<br>The black-robed man looked at Yin Buyu coldly as an even greater amount of black aura poured out from his body.<br>The hand morphed out of black aura had released Yin Buyu&rsquo;s neck, but the black aura had formed dozens of sharp claws that encircled him tightly.<br>From the looks of it, if Yin Buyu were to dare move recklessly, he would be immediately torn to pieces.<br>&ldquo;D-don&rsquo;t kill me, I am the young master of the Yin Clan Manor! My father and the other elders are all here, and they&rsquo;re right outside! If you don&rsquo;t believe me, you can take a look for yourself!<br>&ldquo;If any harm were to befall me, my father and the other elders will definitely not let you off!&rdquo;<br>Yin Buyu was completely panicked. The previous oppressive posture he took had been replaced by terror.<br>&ldquo;Yin Clan Manor? Never heard of it before. Not even the Holy Light Clan is worthy of my sights, let alone a nameless power!&rdquo; the black-robed man scoffed.<br>It didn&rsquo;t look like he was just putting on an act of bravado. His relaxed posture was filled with confidence, revealing his utter lack of fear.<br>Hearing those words from the black-robed man, and putting it together with his unfathomable strength and his condescending attitude, Yin Buyu felt his heart clenching up tightly as he gulped down a mouthful of saliva.<br>He realized that he was standing before a person far beyond his means to deal with, and he dared not to show any signs of arrogance anymore.<br>&ldquo;Milord, as long as you spare me, I&rsquo;ll tell you whatever you wish to know.&rdquo;<br>Yin Buyu tossed aside his dignity and assumed an incredibly humble position. Even if the black-robed man were to ask him to kneel right now, he would do it without hesitation.<br>&ldquo;Tell me, what&rsquo;s going on with that Chu Feng person you keep talking about the last few days? Is he very strong amongst the juniors?&rdquo; the black-robed man asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Chu Feng is the strongest junior in the galaxy right now. However, he&rsquo;s also an incredibly conceited individual too. He declared that every other junior aside from him in the Holy Light Galaxy are all trash, not worthy of mention at all.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s due to his arrogance that I made up my mind to defeat him so as to crush his overbearing attitude.&rdquo;<br>Yin Buyu was also a despicable man too.<br>When he realized that the black-robed man could have very well been here for the tournament too, he immediately began framing Chu Feng in a bad light, hoping that the black-robed man would deal with Chu Feng on his behalf.<br>He had a feeling that this black-robed man should be able to curb Chu Feng without any issue, especially since he had never felt such a terrifying pressure from any other junior to this date.<br>&ldquo;Hearing you put it in such a way, it seems like Chu Feng is quite an interesting person. I&rsquo;m starting to feel a little excited about meeting him,&rdquo; the black-robed man remarked.<br>&ldquo;This brother over here, even though Chu Feng is quite powerful, I reckon that he won&rsquo;t be a match for you. As long as you were to make a move, you should be able to crush him with ease,&rdquo; Yin Buyu said.<br>&ldquo;Cut it with the bootlicking. You aren&rsquo;t anything good either. However, on the account that you have told me some useful moves, I&rsquo;ll let you off for stealing my cultivation resource then.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the black-robed man retracted his black aura before retreating into the shadows and disappearing from view.<br>With the departure of the black-robed man, the space quickly reverted back to normal.<br>At this very moment, everyone from the Yin Clan Manor, including the Manor Chief, Yin Buyu&rsquo;s father, was standing right outside the space.<br>The sudden disappearance of the space resulted in Yin Buyu to reappear back into the real world. He sat paralyzed on the ground, his body drenched in cold sweat.<br>This sight made those from the Yin Clan Manor realize that something was amiss, so they quickly rushed to Yin Buyu&rsquo;s side.<br>&ldquo;Buyu, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;<br>Yin Buyu&rsquo;s father immediately rushed forward to support Yin Buyu as he asked.<br>&ldquo;Father, it seems like we have underestimated the Holy Light Galaxy,&rdquo; Yin Buyu muttered.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Yin Buyu&rsquo;s father asked.<br>&ldquo;I believe that the upcoming tournament will be an exciting one. Aside from the rising star Chu Feng, there are a few other people who will be making a name for themselves,&rdquo; Yin Buyu said.<br>&ldquo;Buyu, did you notice something? Who are you referring to?&rdquo; Yin Buyu&rsquo;s father asked.<br>Yin Buyu quickly told what he had just gone through to the crowd of the Yin Clan Manor.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such a formidable junior? Whose disciple is he?&rdquo;<br>After hearing Yin Buyu&rsquo;s words, even Yin Buyu&rsquo;s father and the experts of the Yin Clan Manor swiftly realized that things weren&rsquo;t as simple as they seemed.<br>If that space was created by the black-robed man for his cultivation, it was likely that he had some formidable treasure on him or had a powerful expert by his side.<br>&hellip;<br>The powers gathered in the Storm Realm had chosen to camp at different locations, but at this moment, almost everyone was gathered on a vast snowfield.<br>The day had finally come for the commencement of the tournament to determine the strongest junior.<br>Cultivators that had come from far and wide filled both land and sky like a huge army of locust. In the middle of this massive crowd, however, lay an empty ground surrounded by a spherical barrier.<br>To be fair, this barrier wasn&rsquo;t very strong, but the flags of the Holy Light Clan that were hoisted around it was more than sufficient to keep people away.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, we have kept you waiting!&rdquo;<br>A voice suddenly boomed from a distance away.<br>Turning the sights over to where the voice came from, the huge congregation of crowd immediately parted to open up a wide path leading to the spherical barrier.<br>In the next moment, several massive warships whizzed across the air in a neat formation.<br>The largest warship of the cluster had innumerable palaces, mountains, and even lakes on it, making it no different from a mobile country. There were numerous flags of the Holy Light Clan that fluttered along with the movements of the warship.<br>And standing at the forefront of the warship was a dark-skinned elder with silver hair and a long beard. He was dressed in silver armor, and a silver crown sat on top of his head.<br>Despite his advanced age, this elder commanded a powerful presence. Just a look from him was enough to compel deference and submission.<br>His disposition was so powerful that there was no one amongst the crowd who was able to undermine him. This was the airs of a true conqueror.<br>This elder was no other than the strongest expert of the Holy Light Galaxy, the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Shengguang Xuanye.<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to Lord Clan Chief!&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing Shengguang Xuanye, everyone present hurriedly bowed deeply and greeted him.<br>No one dared to act disrespectfully in the presence of this man. Even the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others could only assume a subservient attitude before him.<br>&ldquo;You may spare with the formalities.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xuanye said with a grand wave of his sleeves, and an intangible force rippled into the surroundings, supporting everyone back upright while dissipating the barrier beneath.<br>Chu Feng was unable to accurately gauge Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s cultivation, but there was no doubt that he was the strongest cultivator currently in this realm. It was no exaggeration to say that he had the power to decide everyone&rsquo;s life and death.<br>After taking a brief look at Shengguang Xuanye, Chu Feng moved on to turn his gaze toward the very center of this snowfield.<br>After the dissipation of the barrier, a massive dueling ring that emanated an ancient scent came into appearance amidst the snow.<br>This was the heritage left behind by the Rampaging Storm Clan, the Storm Combat Dragon Ring!<br></p></div>
