        <div> - The Master Of This Place<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; The woman asked.<br>&ldquo;Tell me your name first,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You really do not know me?&rdquo; The woman asked.<br>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>At that moment, the woman raised her lips in a slightly proud manner. She was skeptical of Chu Feng&rsquo;s answer.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. Sooner or later, you&rsquo;ll know it. However&hellip; that thing does not belong to you. Return it to me. If you are to do that, I will not make things difficult for you,&rdquo; The woman pointed to the sphere Chu Feng held in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Why must I give it to you? I found it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he fiddled with the sphere in his hand.<br>&ldquo;You truly have a way of arguing. Are you to say that what you find in another&rsquo;s home is yours?&rdquo; The woman asked.<br>&ldquo;This place is evidently not set up by you,&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed to the grand formation.<br>&ldquo;However, this place does indeed belong to me,&rdquo; The woman said.<br>&ldquo;How can you prove that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;If I am to prove it, you are to tell me your name. What say you?&rdquo; The woman said.<br>Chu Feng pondered for a moment. Then, he said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s decided,&rdquo; The woman said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a deal,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;An absolute promise,&rdquo; The woman added.<br>After saying that, the woman walked toward Chu Feng, and then past him.<br>When she approached him, Chu Feng was able to clearly smell her fragrance.<br>That fragrance didn't seem to be emitted by some sort of substance. Rather, it seemed to be emitted by the woman&rsquo;s body.<br>This was&hellip; the fragrance of her body. [1. Body odor yo!]<br>Chu Feng had to admit that that woman was a rare beauty. At the very least&hellip; she was very delightful to the eyes.<br>At that moment, the woman was standing before the grand formation. She took out a special title plate and tossed it into the spirit formation.<br>Then, she began to form hand seals single-handedly. After that, she lightly shouted, &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo;<br>The next moment, that grand formation actually stopped.<br>Then, the woman changed her hand seals and shouted, &ldquo;Turn!&rdquo;<br>The next moment, that grand formation resumed its operation.<br>&ldquo;This place really is her territory,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen was surprised. Evidently, not even she had anticipated for this place to be the woman&rsquo;s territory.<br>As for Chu Feng, he noticed more than just that. When that woman was controlling her title plate, Chu Feng noticed that she was actually also a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Evidently, that woman was not inferior to him in both her talent for martial cultivation and world spirit techniques. After all, she was even younger than Chu Feng.<br>From an initial estimation, Chu Feng felt that the woman was most likely a demon-level genius on the same level as Li Yue&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Go ahead and tell me your name,&rdquo; The woman turned around and asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;And here you said you&rsquo;re not someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; The woman revealed a proud expression. She felt that her guess earlier was correct.<br>&ldquo;I am indeed not from the Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Stubborn. However, it&rsquo;s alright. I will investigate you properly,&rdquo; The woman said.<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression suddenly changed. His heartbeat actually started to accelerate.<br>&ldquo;I did not know that this place actually possessed an owner. I was wrong to have intruded without permission. As such, I will apologize to you here,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist at the woman and bowed.<br>&ldquo;Those who do not know are not at fault. It will do for you to return it to me,&rdquo; The woman pointed to the sphere Chu Feng held in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng tossed the sphere to the woman. He said, &ldquo;I will make up for what I owe you in the future.&rdquo;<br>After he said those words, Chu Feng turned around and prepared to leave.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>However, that woman suddenly called out to him.<br>&ldquo;Young sis, what&rsquo;s wrong? Are you not planning to let me go?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you must promise me that you will definitely keep this place confidential. You cannot tell anyone about this place,&rdquo; The woman said.<br>&ldquo;Definitely,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, I hope that we will meet again some day,&rdquo; The woman said with a smile.<br>Her smile was extremely enchanting. It was also very gentle. Seeing that smile, one would feel intoxicated.<br>However, Chu Feng was not charmed by that smile.<br>Instead, he smiled lightly and said, &ldquo;Likewise, farewell.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng directly left.<br>Chu Feng was walking very fast. After exiting, he immediately started to rapidly walk toward the outside of the Sacred Mountain.<br>&ldquo;Why are you walking so hurriedly? Why not chat with that girl some more? This Queen felt that she had quite a decent impression of you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For her to possess such talent and such cultivation, she most definitely possesses a deep background.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to befriend her, it will help you gain a foothold in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;For some unknown reason, I suddenly have a very uneasy feeling. This sort of feeling makes me feel that I must leave this place quickly,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>That sort of feeling was something that Chu Feng only felt after that woman activated the grand formation.<br>&ldquo;Moreover, that woman herself is also very dangerous. She was trying to kill me earlier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, she suddenly had a change in attitude,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you revealed your Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique and increased your battle power. On top of that, you also revealed the overwhelming might of your Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword. She was no match for you,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not because of that,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What would it be if it wasn&rsquo;t that?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because she felt that I was from the Chu Heavenly Clan. Thus, she is not afraid of me. Rather, she was giving face to the Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Moreover, she never feared me the entire time. She most definitely possesses something she can rely on. At the very least, she felt that I would definitely not be a match for her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What sort of thing do you think she has still?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;She either possesses an ability that can surpass me or&hellip; she has a helper,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That would be bad then. Quickly, leave this place. Furthermore&hellip; do not proceed to the vortex leading to the wasteland for now. You don&rsquo;t want them to find that,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was thinking too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eggy, say, do you think this is what they mean by a meeting of minds?&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Look at the situation! You still have the heart to joke around at a time like this? Quickly, start running!&rdquo; Her Lady Queen urged.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Milady,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile. After he finished saying that, he revealed all of his abilities and started to run rapidly toward the outside of the mountain.<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...<br>Meanwhile, inside the vast hall. An old man had appeared beside that woman.<br>Chu Feng had guessed correctly. Sure enough, that woman wasn&rsquo;t alone.<br>That man was wearing a gray-colored sackcloth gown. His gown was very shabby-looking. In fact, there were patches everywhere. Yet, it was completely spotless.<br>Furthermore, that old man had a head of white hair. Furthermore, he had a long, snow-white, beard.<br>Most importantly, that old man&rsquo;s aura was extremely profound. One could not see through it.<br>&ldquo;Master, why have I never heard of a Chu Feng from the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; The woman asked the old man.<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he say that he wasn&rsquo;t from the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; The old man said with a faint laugh.<br>&ldquo;Not from the Chu Heavenly Clan? I don&rsquo;t believe that,&rdquo; The woman shook her head.<br>&ldquo;Haha,&rdquo; The old man laughed louder. There was a trace of ridicule in his laughter.<br>The woman was able to sense the ridicule in her master&rsquo;s laughter. Thus, she asked, &ldquo;Master, he really isn&rsquo;t from the Chu Heavenly Clan? Could it be&hellip; he&rsquo;s from another Upper Realm?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unknown,&rdquo; The old man said.<br>&ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve said that sooner. If he wasn&rsquo;t from the Chu Heavenly Clan, I wouldn&rsquo;t have let him go,&rdquo; The woman said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no harm in letting him go,&rdquo; The old man said.<br>&ldquo;What if he is to reveal this location to others?&rdquo; The woman said.<br>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; The old man said.<br>&ldquo;Master, why do you trust him so much? Could it be that you know him?&rdquo; The woman asked.<br>&ldquo;I naturally do not know him. Merely, my intuition tells me that child possesses a decent character. He should be one to keep his promise,&rdquo; The old man said.<br>&ldquo;Master, since you say it like that, I am relieved. After all, Master has never been mistaken about someone before,&rdquo; The woman said.<br>&ldquo;That said, that man was quite strange. He actually said that he owed me and would compensate me in the future. What did he mean by that?&rdquo;<br>The woman seemed to realize that Chu Feng&rsquo;s words had some sort of implied meaning. However, she was unable to understand what he meant by that.<br>&ldquo;He naturally owes you,&rdquo; The old man said.<br>&ldquo;He owes me?&rdquo; The woman asked.<br>&ldquo;Foolish girl. You should inspect the natural energies contained in that Primal Chaos Metamorphosis Sphere carefully,&rdquo; The old man said.<br>Hearing those words, the woman started to sense the Primal Chaos Metamorphosis Sphere. Upon doing so, her expression immediately changed.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually empty?! It has accumulated natural energies for ten whole years, it should be full by now. Why would it be empty?&rdquo;<br>The woman looked to the old man. Her beautiful eyes were flickering nonstop. She seemed to want to find an answer.<br>As for the old man, he merely smiled and didn&rsquo;t say anything.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him, it&rsquo;s that Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, how did he manage to accomplish that? I can tell that the spirit formation outside should&rsquo;ve just been set up not long ago. He should have only been in here for a short period of time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How did he manage to completely plunder all of the natural energies contained in the Primal Chaos Metamorphosis Sphere in such a short period of time?&rdquo; The woman was extremely puzzled.<br>She knew very well that one needed to use a treasure of equal level to extract the natural energies in the Primal Chaos Metamorphosis Sphere.<br>Apart from that, there was only one other method. That was to directly refine the natural energies.<br>However, the natural energies contained inside the sphere were gathered by the spirit formation and then forcibly compressed into the sphere. As such, the nature of the natural energies had changed. They had become exceptionally berserk. It was simply impossible for people to refine it.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know either. It is already extraordinary that that child was able to find this place,&rdquo; The old man said.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! No wonder he said those words and escaped so quickly. So he was actually a thief.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, I must go find him and have a word with him,&rdquo; After the woman finished saying those words, she immediately rushed outside.<br><br><br></p></div>
