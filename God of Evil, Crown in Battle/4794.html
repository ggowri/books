        <div>: An Opportunity<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Zuoqiu Youyu, do you take the others as fools? If you dare to kill us, my grandfathers definitely won&rsquo;t let you off!&rdquo;<br>Sensing that they were in a bad position here, Xia Yan immediately brought out her grandfathers to intimidate Zuoqiu Youyu.<br>Zuoqiu Youyu didn&rsquo;t say a word. Instead, he walked up to Xia Yan, raised his fist, and punched straight into her abdomen. It was a powerful strike that sent Xia Yan spurting blood, and she fell onto her knees weakly.<br>However, Zuoqiu Youyu didn&rsquo;t just stop right there. He grabbed Xia Yan by her hair and lifted her up into the air.<br>Xia Yan glared at him furiously, but the earlier punch was so strong that her body couldn&rsquo;t stop trembling. She could only stare helplessly at Zuoqiu Youyu&rsquo;s cold face, and for some reason, it was striking fear in her at this very moment.<br>&ldquo;Are you threatening me with your two grandfathers? Let&rsquo;s make a bet this time around then. We&rsquo;ll see if your two grandfathers will be able to do anything to me after I kill you.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Zuoqiu Youyu grabbed Xia Yan by her hair and smashed her head onto the ground.<br>Zuoqiu Yanliang watched as Zuoqiu Youyu tortured Xia Yan, but there was no pity in his eyes at all. Instead, he was more than gleeful at the turn of events.<br>All along, the two of them had to tolerate Xia Yan due to her identity and her talent, but in truth, they already had a lot of pent-up frustrations against her.<br>After dealing with Xia Yan, Zuoqiu Youyu turned to Zuoqiu Yanliang and said, &ldquo;This is a rare opportunity for us as well, so let&rsquo;s part ways and seek our own fortuitous encounters. If you stumble upon Chu Feng, just go ahead and end his life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What if we aren&rsquo;t able to find Chu Feng before the trial comes to an end?&rdquo; Zuoqiu Yanliang asked as he shot a glance at Xia Yan and the others.<br>He was asking how they should deal with Xia Yan and the others if they couldn&rsquo;t find Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I already tell you? Big brother, you can&rsquo;t be feeling sorry for them right now, are you?&rdquo; Zuoqiu Youyu asked.<br>&ldquo;Why would I? I&rsquo;m just afraid that we would put our grandfather in a spot,&rdquo; Zuoqiu Yanliang said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong. What we&rsquo;re doing now is solving a huge problem for our grandfather.&rdquo;<br>Leaving those words behind, Zuoqiu Youyu turned away and left the area. Despite his departure, the rope tying down Xia Yan and the others still remained as tight as ever, leaving them utterly helpless to retaliate.<br>Zuoqiu Yanliang took out a Cosmos Sack and stuffed Xia Yan and the others into it before heading off in a different direction as Zuoqiu Youyu.<br>He was going to seek his own fortuitous encounter too.<br>&hellip;<br>At the same time, at another area in the Yinyang Withered Well Realm, Chu Feng was currently rushing forth with his presence concealed. He had activated the Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and even the Four Symbols Divine Power, putting out everything in order to raise his speed.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, where are we going? Are you going to look for Xia Yan and the others?&rdquo; Yu Sha asked.<br>&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t head back,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;But you got assaulted earlier. Wouldn&rsquo;t Xia Yan and the others be in danger if you don&rsquo;t head back?&rdquo; Yu Sha asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unlikely that they&rsquo;re in danger. Besides, I&rsquo;m not a match for Zuoqiu Yanliang and Zuoqiu Youyu yet. If I were to head back, I would be really putting them in danger,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Are you certain that it was Zuoqiu Youyu who tried to kill you?&rdquo; Yu Sha asked.<br>&ldquo;He was definitely the one who made the move,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied confidently.<br>&ldquo;Then&hellip; how did you manage to get away? I didn&rsquo;t understand what was going on at all.&rdquo;<br>Even though Yu Sha was by Chu Feng&rsquo;s side all along, she wasn&rsquo;t able to see how Chu Feng made his escape. She only sensed danger for a brief moment before Chu Feng was suddenly transported elsewhere.<br>Right after that, Chu Feng began rushing in a certain direction without any hesitation, as if he had already determined his destination.<br>&ldquo;The aura bestowed upon us represents an opportunity, but luck has a huge part to play as to whether we&rsquo;ll be able to realize this opportunity or not. To put it simply, even if we manage to find the location and complete the trial, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that we&rsquo;ll be able to get the prize.<br>&ldquo;Of course, the denser the aura is, the greater the chances of acquiring the prize. In other words, Zuoqiu Youyu and I are the ones who are most likely to benefit the most from this fortuitous encounter.<br>&ldquo;However, aside from what I&rsquo;ve just mentioned, there&rsquo;s actually another separate fortuitous encounter to be obtained from the bestowed auras. In truth, each of the auras we have obtained is a part of a map. This map reveals the location of an ultimate fortuitous encounter, and as long as one successfully clears the trial there, one will be able to acquire the treasure lying there for sure..<br>&ldquo;The reason why I could escape from Zuoqiu Youyu&rsquo;s assault earlier was due to the benefit I obtained from the aura. This benefit would save me once when I&rsquo;m in grievous danger, but I ended up wasting it as soon as I obtained it. But it did save my life after all. If not for it, I would have already been dead by now.&rdquo;<br>Rage began to flurry in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>He didn&rsquo;t have any grudge with Zuoqiu Youyu, but the latter sought to claim his life right away. This was a grudge that he was determined to repay.<br>&ldquo;I see&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Upon learning that Chu Feng had used up his only escape means, Yu Sha dared not to ask Chu Feng to return to look for Xia Yan and the others anymore. She didn&rsquo;t hope for any danger to fall upon Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Are you heading to the destination reflected on the complete map formed by the auras now?&rdquo; Yu Sha asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I have to obtain the treasure lying there by hook or by crook. This is the only way I can stand against Zuoqiu Youyu and Zuoqiu Yanliang,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Is the treasure there similar to the Hellking&rsquo;s power?&rdquo; Yu Sha asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what lies there, but I know for sure that the auras that everyone else has received would dissipate once I obtain the treasure. If so, Zuoqiu Yanliang and Zuoqiu Youyu would lose their chances with the fortuitous encounter,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;<br>Yu Sha was excited to hear those words. However, she soon thought of something else and asked, &ldquo;What about Xia Yan and the others?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I can only find a way to repay them in the future. But no matter what, I can&rsquo;t allow Zuoqiu Youyu and Zuoqiu Yanliang to benefit from this trial,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br></p></div>
