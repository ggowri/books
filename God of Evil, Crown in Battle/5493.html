        <h1>Chapter 5493: Weird</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Chu Feng was on the warship, sharing his journey in the Immemorial Star Sea with Long Chengyu and Long Muxi, by the time the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief returned, so the latter chose to maintain his concealment and listen to their conversation.</span><br><span>Chu Feng described his journey to the stone monument, but he neglected to mention that he suspected that something had been in that area. After all, it was just speculation on his part.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu and Long Muxi were perplexed to learn that the safe route through the Immemorial Star Sea led to nothing at all. They were convinced that a secret was hidden there, just that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t able to uncover it.</span><br><span>While it was a wasted trip, Chu Feng still continued to keep an eye on the Immemorial Star Sea. It felt unfathomable to him even though he was already now a Half-God level cultivator, and it piqued his curiosity.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly narrowed his eyes.</span><br><span>Shortly after, a commotion broke out below, as the crowd also noticed the changes with the Immemorial Star Sea. A red fog had risen from it to cover the entire sea.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Even the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was alarmed by the red fog.</span><br><span>The red fog grew thicker and thicker, to the point where even the night sky was dyed blood-red. Within a matter of moments, the beautiful Immemorial Star Sea had turned sinister. Not only so, but the red fog appeared to be sentient, as it started to converge into a rising hurricane.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Pull back the warship!&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief removed his concealment and issued an order.</span><br><span>The warship immediately backed away from the Immemorial Star Sea.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Father, what&rsquo;s that red fog?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked nervously.</span><br><span>He thought that his father might know something about it since the latter ordered their warships to retreat.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, but such a phenomenon has never appeared on the Immemorial Star Sea before. It&rsquo;s best to proceed carefully,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said. He then turned to Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, did you notice anything?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Most of the Totem Dragon Clansmen had rushed onto the deck to see what was going on by then. It would have been inconceivable for the lofty Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to ask a junior for his thoughts on a matter, but it didn&rsquo;t feel that way when the junior was Chu Feng.</span><br><span>There was something special about Chu Feng, after all.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It feels like spirit power yet not really so. Something is manifesting from it. We&rsquo;ll know once the manifestation is complete,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo; The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief nodded in agreement. That was his take as well.</span><br><span>Hu!</span><br><span>An intense gale blew from the Immemorial Star Sea.</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief immediately stood in front of everyone else as he sensed a dangerous aura from it. Fortunately, the gale stopped at the edges of the Immemorial Star Sea before dissipating.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Father, I sensed some kind of energy hidden in that gale,&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked his father with an uncertain look on his face.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s a powerful energy hidden in that gale, though it only appeared for a brief instant,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s stopped. Did that energy stop the fog from manifesting?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd speculated. They noticed that the red fog had stopped manifesting after the brief appearance of the gale.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How weird. Chu Feng, did you notice anything?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Both the fog and the gale were too strong. I&rsquo;m unable to see through them,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a worried frown. He was worrying not for himself but Little Fishy, who might still be inside the Immemorial Star Sea.</span><br><span>Grar!</span><br><span>A piercing call suddenly echoed from behind, and a furious wind followed.</span><br><span>The crowd turned their attention over, only to see a giant bird with a wing span of over ten thousand meters flying in their direction. The bird resembled a crane, but its black body and blood-red eyes indicated that it was a demonic beast.</span><br><span>The furious wind was coming from the crane&rsquo;s flapping wings.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Daoist Demon Crane? He has finally shown himself after disappearing for so many years?&rdquo;</span><br><span>A commotion broke out amidst the crowd. They recognized the identity of the crane.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>He noticed that something was special about the crane. It emanated the aura of the Ancient Era, but most important of all, it actually wasn&rsquo;t a living being despite its lifelike appearance.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Daoist Demon Crane is a formidable world spiritist. Even the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has extended an invitation to him, but he turned them down. He is best known for his demon crane, which is the one we are seeing right before our eyes. The demon crane is a treasure containing many good things that are beneficial to world spiritists like you,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Those words piqued Chu Feng&rsquo;s interest in the demon crane.</span><br><span>As the demon crane came closer, he realized that there was someone standing on its head. That person was around two meters tall, but he had a pale face and was extremely skinny as if he was terminally ill. Without a doubt, he was Daoist Demon Crane.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Daoist Demon Crane, it has been a long time since you last appeared. Does this mean that the demon crane is about to open once again?&rdquo; the crowd asked.</span><br><span>The world spiritists present revealed expectant looks.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I have come here under the guidance of the demon crane, but it isn&rsquo;t time for its opening yet,&rdquo; Daoist Demon Crane said.</span><br><span>The world spiritists could hardly conceal their disappointment.</span><br><span>But as soon as those words were spoken, the demon crane suddenly descended to the ground and opened its mouth wide before falling completely still. Its movements confused the crowd.</span><br><span>They knew that the demon crane was actually a treasure. It wouldn&rsquo;t open its mouth under normal circumstances, even when it was crying out. Only when the demon crane going to open up would it open its mouth.</span><br><span>Considering that Daoist Demon Crane has just said that it wasn&rsquo;t time yet, it was </span><span>perplexing why the Demon Crane had opened its mouth.</span><br><span>This was extremely weird, be it the Immemorial Star Sea or Daoist Demon Crane.</span><br></p></div>
