        <div>: Cultivating God-level Secret Skills<br>&ldquo;God-level secret skills?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was overjoyed to hear those words. He had expected no less from the Divine Deer, but it was hard to suppress the delight bursting from his heart.<br>According to Lord Yuwei, there were levels of secret skills&mdash;&lsquo;Emperor&rsquo;, &lsquo;Ancestral&rsquo;, &lsquo;Immortal&rsquo;, &lsquo;Exalted&rsquo;, and &lsquo;God&rsquo; level.<br>The Divine Deer was actually a secret skill from the Ancient Era, but she was a special case. From the prowess she had displayed thus far, Chu Feng guessed that she was likely to be a God-level secret skill.<br>He was thrilled to learn that his guess was spot-on. God-level was the highest tier for secret skills, so how could he possibly not be thrilled to learn them?<br>&ldquo;Elder, when do you intend to impart your abilities to me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a fawning smile.<br>He couldn&rsquo;t wait to grasp a God-level secret skill.<br>&ldquo;When do you wish to learn them?&rdquo; the Divine Deer asked.<br>&ldquo;As soon as possible, of course. It&rsquo;d be best if we could do it right now,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Right now? You shouldn&rsquo;t be in such a rush. I have already told you that it won&rsquo;t be that easy to grasp my abilities. Now that you know that there are different tiers to secret skills, you should understand just how powerful God-level secret skills are. It&rsquo;s impossible for you to control or grasp them with your current level of cultivation,&rdquo; the Divine Deer said.<br>&ldquo;Does that mean that I can&rsquo;t learn them yet?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt a little deflated to hear those words. No matter how powerful the God-level secret skills the Divine Deer was going to teach him was, there was no point if he was unable to use it.<br>&ldquo;You can still learn them if you wish to, but you won&rsquo;t be able to fully grasp them,&rdquo; the Divine Deer said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to learn them anyway,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Find a safe place first. I&rsquo;ll go deeper into details afterward,&rdquo; the Divine Deer said.<br>&ldquo;Great! Elder, just give me a moment. I&rsquo;ll find a safe place right now!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng hurriedly made his way to a remote area and constructed a concealment formation around himself before asking, &ldquo;Elder, is this good enough?&rdquo;<br>He had moved quickly out of fear that the Divine Deer would ignore him once again. It hadn&rsquo;t been easy for him to get the Divine Deer to talk to him, and he didn&rsquo;t want to let this precious opportunity slip through his fingers.<br>&ldquo;Fuse your consciousness with mine,&rdquo; the Divine Deer instructed.<br>As those words were spoken, Chu Feng could vaguely sense the Divine Deer&rsquo;s existence within him. He quickly did as he was told and fused his consciousness with her.<br>Weng!<br>Chu Feng found himself brought into a mysterious realm. The land was completely covered in trees, but these trees were bizarrely short, standing at a height of around thirty centimeters tall. The contrast in height left him feeling like a giant.<br>Yet, for some reason, the flowers here were massive. Some of them were even thousands of meters high, blocking off huge swathes of the sky.<br>Once again, the contrast in height made him feel insignificant like an ant.<br>The sky was blue like the deep sea, and the clouds came in bizarre shapes. In particular, the sun looked exceptionally huge, boasting a size that was more than a hundred times larger than usual. It took up a significant portion of the sky by itself.<br>As a result, the realm was exceptionally bright.<br>Everything in this world was emanating dense auras of the Ancient Era, be it the land or the plants. This was the realm where Chu Feng had first met the Divine Deer.<br>A beautiful woman stood in front of Chu Feng.<br>She had a fair complexion that glowed under the sunlight and a curvaceous physique that showed even under her long dress. She emanated an aura reminiscent of an inviolable deity from heaven, which made her stand out from the masses.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t their first meeting, but Chu Feng still found himself enchanted by her beauty. It was rare for him to be mesmerized by any woman other than Eggy.<br>She was none other than the Divine Deer.<br>Unlike their first meeting, the Divine Deer had transmogrified into a human and was wearing clothes.<br>&ldquo;Brat, I&rsquo;ll get straight to the point. My abilities consist of three moves&mdash;Divine Concealment, Divine Flitting, and Divine Evasion.<br>&ldquo;The first move, Divine Concealment, involves concealing your aura. Once you master it, no Half-God level cultivators will be able to detect your aura without resorting to special detection means. I should remind you that concealing your aura is not the same as concealing your body. There&rsquo;s no point concealing your aura when the other party can see your body.<br>&ldquo;The second move, Divine Flitting, allows you to accelerate beyond the limitations of your current cultivation level for a short period of time. The skill will grow stronger as you become stronger. Let me put it this way for you. A rank one Half-God level cultivator using Divine Flitting should be able to outspeed an average rank five Half-God level cultivator. Similarly, a rank five Half-God level cultivator should be able to outspeed an average peak Half-God level cultivator. However, you&rsquo;ll have to be at Half-God level to grasp this secret skill.<br>&ldquo;As for the third move, Divine Evasion, that&rsquo;s my strongest ability. It grants you the power to evade attacks that are far beyond your means to deal with. A rank one True God level cultivator using this ability would be able to evade an attack from even a rank seven True God level cultivator. However, this ability can only be executed once within a short period of time, which means that you&rsquo;ll still be in danger if you face a series of fatal attacks. You&rsquo;ll have to reach True God level to learn this skill.<br>&ldquo;If you do manage to master those three moves, there&rsquo;s a chance that you might be able to grasp the fourth move too,&rdquo; the Divine Deer said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, what&rsquo;s the fourth move?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked out of curiosity.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a secret,&rdquo; the Divine Deer replied.<br>Seeing that the Divine Deer was unwilling to share further details about the fourth move, Chu Feng decided to pose more questions about the first three moves.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I noticed that the examples you have listed are those within the same cultivation level. What about situations across cultivation levels? For example, a rank nine Half-God level cultivator using Divine Flitting against a rank one True God level cultivator,&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The effects of Divine Flitting are limited against cultivators of a higher cultivation level,&rdquo; the Divine Deer replied.<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t surprised to hear that. It was already extremely hard to bridge the gap between each cultivation rank, let alone cultivation level. However, his eyes soon narrowed when he noticed the subtlety behind the words used by the Divine Deer.<br>The Divine Deer had said that the effects were limited, but she didn&rsquo;t say that it was ineffective.<br>&ldquo;Elder, are you saying that Divine Flitting is effective even against cultivators of a higher cultivation level?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; the Divine Deer replied matter-of-factly.<br>Delighted to hear that, Chu Feng asked, &ldquo;Can you tell me more about it in detail?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Using the example I have just stated, it&rsquo;d be possible for a rank five Half-God level cultivator to outrun most rank nine Half-God level cultivators using Divine Flitting, but there are exceedingly powerful cultivators who break the norms. In other words, you&rsquo;ll have to be at least at rank six Half-God level in order to be unmatched in terms of speed within the Half-God level.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to be at rank eight Half-God level at the very minimum in order to escape from a rank one True God level cultivator using Divine Flitting. Similarly, at rank nine Half-God level, you should be able escape from a rank two True God level cultivator.<br>&ldquo;However, there is a caveat&mdash;those True God level cultivators can&rsquo;t be exceptionally strong. If the enemies you encounter are either unusually strong or in possession of special means, the effectiveness of Divine Flitting will be compromised,&rdquo; the Divine Deer said.<br>&ldquo;So, the skill does work across cultivation levels. That&rsquo;s truly overpowered!&rdquo; Chu Feng exclaimed in delight.<br>While the effectiveness of Divine Flitting was compromised across cultivation levels, the effects were still out of the world. No one in the world would believe that a rank eight Half-God level cultivator would actually be able to outrun a rank one True God level cultivator!<br>Just thinking about how maddened True God level cultivators would be when they found themselves being outsped by a Half-God level cultivator was enough to make Chu Feng&rsquo;s face light up in delight.<br>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t be worthy of being considered God-level secret skills if they can&rsquo;t even do as much,&rdquo; the Divine Deer replied with a gleeful smile.<br>&ldquo;What about Divine Evasion then? Does that apply too?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>In truth, Divine Flitting and Divine Evasion were the two moves that he wanted to learn the most at the moment. Divine Flitting allowed to escape from even the most tenuous of situations, whereas Divine Evasion allowed him to survive even the most desperate of situations.<br>By putting the two of them to good use, he would be able to catch his enemy off-guard.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no point thinking so much into it when you can&rsquo;t even cultivate it yet. You&rsquo;re still a distance away from Half-God level, let alone True God level,&rdquo; the Divine Deer replied.<br>&ldquo;Haha, I&rsquo;m just curious about it,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with an awkward laugh.<br>&ldquo;Who knows how long a troublemaker like you can survive for? We can talk more about it when you survive till True God level. Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll retract all of my powers and choose a new host,&rdquo; the Divine Deer rolled her eyes and replied.<br>She was reproaching Chu Feng for getting into trouble at every turn.<br>However, it was not that Chu Feng liked getting into trouble, but how could he simply swallow it down when other people were already trampling on him? Not to mention, he couldn&rsquo;t possibly turn a blind eye when his friends were being bullied.<br>He wouldn&rsquo;t be a man if he backed down just because his opponents were stronger than him.<br>Principles had never truly existed in the world of cultivation.Strength was the one true law here, and this was a fact implicitly understood by all cultivators. That was also why most cultivators chose to do as they pleased.<br>Chu Feng would rather be dead if he had to live his life subserviently.<br>He felt indignant at being labeled a troublemaker, but he couldn&rsquo;t argue against that. After all, he was never one to shy away from a confrontation. All he could do was to laugh awkwardly.<br>&ldquo;Is Divine Concealment the only skill I can learn at the moment?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It should be possible with your current cultivation level, but Divine Concealment isn&rsquo;t easy to learn either. I&rsquo;ll have to fuse my energy with your soul to refine your body, and that&rsquo;ll be an extremely painful process. It&rsquo;s not something that can be achieved within a short period of time, so you shouldn&rsquo;t rush into it,&rdquo; the Divine Deer replied.<br>&ldquo;Elder, can I give it a try right now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;<br>The Divine Deer opened her hand and manifested a bundle of light above her palm. Initially, it was around the size of a pearl, but it swiftly expanded into the size of a watermelon. The bundle of light shared the same inviolable aura as the Divine Deer.<br>&ldquo;Try to refine it, but don&rsquo;t push yourself too far. If you can&rsquo;t withstand the pain, your mind might just collapse and you&rsquo;ll turn into a fool. No one will be able to save you then,&rdquo; the Divine Deer reminded.<br>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng sat down and began refining the bundle of light. He heeded the Divine Deer&rsquo;s warning and took in only a small portion of the light to refine, but even so, his forehead tightened up right away from the pain.<br>The Divine Deer intently stared at Chu Feng&rsquo;s face to grasp his condition through his expression. There was a nervous look on her face. She knew how violent her powers were, and she was worried that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to withstand it.<br>The refinement process proceeded on, but Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression didn&rsquo;t further tighten up. Seeing that, Divine Deer&rsquo;s nervousness slowly alleviated, and she nodded in approval. She was satisfied with Chu Feng&rsquo;s performance.<br>&ldquo;How does he have the guts to do this?&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, the Divine Deer widened her eyes in astonishment.<br>Chu Feng had gotten much bolder after refining a small portion of the light bundle that he was actually trying to refine tenfold of the initial amount at once!<br>He was too anxious for success, and that was taboo for cultivators.<br>The Divine Deer wanted to berate him.<br>Gah!<br>Chu Feng suddenly let out a furious roar as extreme pain showed on his face.<br>However, the Divine Deer decided against saying anything after seeing that. She noticed that Chu Feng&rsquo;s roar wasn&rsquo;t a scream of agony. Despite his warped face, his condition was swiftly stabilizing.<br>&ldquo;How is that brat able to endure this? Is he not human?&rdquo; the Divine Deer murmured in disbelief.<br>She knew her power better than anyone else, which was why she knew that the amount of pain increased exponentially along with the rate of absorption of her energy. The pain that Chu Feng was being put through was not something an ordinary human could withstand.<br>Unless Chu Feng was no ordinary human.<br></div>
