        <div> - Meeting The Immortal<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;As the saying goes, those who have come are guests. Since everyone has managed to reach the Immortal Island, it means that fate has brought all of us together.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, even if everyone is unable to obtain the tailor-made weapons from my master, you all may still stay on our Immortal Island as guests for several days,&rdquo; After taking care of Beitang Zimo, Baili Xinghe spoke to the crowd.<br>Suddenly, someone asked, &ldquo;Would we be able to meet Weaponry Refinement Immortal if we stay as guests?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. My master is someone who is not fond of entertaining guests. This time, only the five people that have managed to pass the trials are able to meet my master,&rdquo; Baili Xinghe said.<br>After hearing those words, many people began to sigh. Actually, many of them had braved dangers to come here with the goal of meeting Weaponry Refinement Immortal, and not to obtain tailor-made weapons from him. They merely wished to meet this Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. However, they were told that they would not be able to meet him. This caused them to be filled with regret.<br>&ldquo;Even though my master is not planning to see guests, he has also mentioned that it has not been easy for everyone to come here from so far away. To be able to pass through my master&rsquo;s spirit formations and reach the Immortal Island is even more difficult. Thus, my master has prepared a gift for everyone,&rdquo; Baili Xinghe continued.<br>&ldquo;Gift? May we know what gift it might be?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the depressed emotions of the crowd were immediately alleviated. After all, a gift from the Weaponry Refinement Immortal was most definitely not something ordinary.<br>&ldquo;Immortal Cultivation Lake,&rdquo; Baili Xinghe said.<br>&ldquo;Immortal Cultivation Lake? What is that?&rdquo; The crowd became even more excited upon hearing this name. That was because the name was enough to tell them that the so-called Immortal Cultivation Lake must be a very remarkable place. However, they still wished to know exactly what the Immortal Cultivation Lake was.<br>&ldquo;My master has gathered countless natural oddities, rare treasures and peerless medicinal herbs. Then, he refined them through the use of spirit formations and imbued them with his Dragon Mark Royal-level spirit power. He spent a total of nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine days to finally refine a medicinal lake.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only does this medicinal lake contain very strong martial energy, it also contains spirit energy. Furthermore, none of the energies contained in the lake are berserk. Thus, cultivators of any cultivation will be able to enter it safely and absorb those energies. Upon entering, one will definitely be able to obtain quite a significant harvest.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Due to the fact that the energies contained in the lake are enormous, and the lake was refined by my master through meticulous labor, my master ended up naming it the &lsquo;Immortal Cultivation Lake,&rsquo;&rdquo; Baili Xinghe said.<br>After hearing what Baili Xinghe said, the crowd immediately burst into an uproar. Practically everyone decided that they would be staying. After all, all the people present here were martial cultivators. Why would they want to miss such a rare opportunity?<br>In fact, even Beitang Zimo, who had been humiliated by Baili Xinghe earlier, did not leave. Instead, he decided to shamelessly stay.<br>After all, in the entire Holy Land of Martialism, there were only several Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists. Furthermore, they were all extraordinary beings who could not be sought after.<br>And now, the opportunity to experience the Immortal Cultivation Lake that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal had spent nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine days and countless treasures to refine was presented to him. Naturally, Beitang Zimo would also not want to miss it.<br>Thus, all the people that managed to reach the Immortal Island decided to stay and wait for the opportunity to enter the Immortal Cultivation Lake.<br>At the moment when the crowd was overjoyed by the fact that they could enter that Immortal Cultivation Lake, Baili Xinghe suddenly spoke. &ldquo;Since everyone has decided to stay, then please follow the rules of our Immortal Island. You all can move about freely in places where we have allowed you all to go. However, for places where we do not allow you all to go to, it would be best for you to not set foot into them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you do not listen to this warning of mine, I&rsquo;m afraid that you will not be able to leave our Immortal Island again.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, he turned around and left without bothering with the reaction from the crowd.<br>Arrogance. This Baili Xinghe was also extremely arrogant. However, his arrogance was different from other people&rsquo;s arrogance. For example, those with great strength would generally look down upon those weaker than them by relying on their stronger cultivation or strength.<br>However, Baili Xinghe was different. His arrogance was fundamental to his character. He was someone who did not place anyone in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;That Baili Xinghe is truly arrogant. His words and actions are all extremely relentless,&rdquo; Nangong Baihe did not like Baili Xinghe&rsquo;s character. She also did not like the way he handled things.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, he&rsquo;s a bit arrogant. However, it remains that he is the Weaponry Refinement Immortal&rsquo;s personal disciple, and a first-rate genius. Very few people possess the talent to compare with him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For someone like him, it would instead be strange if he were not arrogant,&rdquo; Nangong Ya said.<br>&ldquo;Based on those words of yours, doesn&rsquo;t that mean that both Chu Feng and you are very strange then? Logically, the two of you possess the qualifications to be arrogant, no?&rdquo; Nangong Baihe asked.<br>&ldquo;Oh, if it&rsquo;s me, you can forget about it. I do not think that I have the qualifications to be arrogant. As for Brother Chu Feng, he&rsquo;s not strange. Merely, he&rsquo;s too humble,&rdquo; Nangong Ya said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to be humble. I&rsquo;m more fond of humble people,&rdquo; As Nangong Baihe spoke, she took a glance at Chu Feng and smiled a sweet and touching smile.<br>&ldquo;Yoh, Brother Chu Feng, you are truly someone who girls are fond of. You must know that this is the first time that this lil sis of mine has praised a man like that,&rdquo; Nangong Ya said to Chu Feng with a mischievous smile on his face.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng was a bit speechless. This pair of siblings had ended up turning the subject of their talk to him.<br>Actually, with Chu Feng&rsquo;s character, he might have teased Nangong Baihe. However, the current Chu Feng was worried about Zi Ling and Su Rou&rsquo;s safety. Thus, he was truly not in the mood to tease anyone.<br>After Baili Xinghe left, many more people appeared from the Immortal Island. They were all wearing white clothes and conical bamboo hats. They had the appearance of extraordinary experts. Furthermore, their cultivations were all very extraordinary too. This Immortal Island was truly a place with experts like clouds.<br>The people on the Immortal Island all gave off airs of arrogance. Thus, they were not fond of speaking, and were not enthusiastic. However&hellip; it could still be said that they were doing their best to arrange a living situation for their guests.<br>Chu Feng, Tantai Xue, Nangong Ya, Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli were all arranged into different residences. Chu Feng&rsquo;s residence was a wooden house. From a glance, it appeared to be very simple and crude. However, the scenery around it was very good. It was located at the peak of a cliff. Below it was a sea of clouds, with the occasional crane flying past. The sound of the cranes would truly let one feel carefree and relaxed. Even Chu Feng&rsquo;s worried state of mind was noticeably lifted.<br>However, before Chu Feng could enjoy the beautiful scenery of this place, he was called out by a person from the Immortal Island.<br>Following that person, he arrived at a vast forest deep in the Immortal Island. Trees that reached the sky covered his line of sight. Although the trees shaded the ground, rays of sunlight still passed through them, illuminating the ground below. Occasionally, hares would hop by. Walking within this vast forest was a very sensational experience.<br>In the center of the vast forest was an open land. It was not very large. However, there was a simple and crude thatched hut and a little courtyard there.<br>At this moment, smoke was rising in spirals out of that thatched hut&rsquo;s chimney.<br>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; After they arrived at the courtyard, the person who had guided Chu Feng here stopped and indicated to Chu Feng that he should enter the courtyard.<br>Chu Feng entered the courtyard, pushed the door to the thatched hut open, and walked in.<br>The thing that caught Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes immediately was a stove. That was because the smoke coming out from the chimney was being emitted by that stove.<br>There were several sweet potatoes on the stove. They were already cooked. Their delicious smell immediately assailed Chu Feng&rsquo;s nostrils.<br>There was an old man sitting beside the stove. The old man had a head of white hair. His hair appeared to be a bit unkempt. His beard was also a bit unkempt. At a glance, his appearance appeared to be somewhat messy.<br>However, his clothes were not unkempt at all. His clothes were as white as snow, and not a speck of dust could be found on them.<br>Chu Feng was unable to determine this old man&rsquo;s cultivation. At a glance, he looked like an ordinary person. However, this old man possessed an incomparable aura. From a glance, one could tell that he was not an ordinary person. To be exact, he simply did not appear like a person, a mortal. Rather, he appeared like an Immortal.<br>Chu Feng had seen many people who had named themselves to be &lsquo;Immortal.&rsquo; Among all of them, this person before him looked the most like an immortal. Likely, this person before him was the owner of the Immortal Island, the Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist famous throughout the entire Holy Land of Martialism, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal.<br></p></div>
