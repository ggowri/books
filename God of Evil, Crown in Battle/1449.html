        <div> - Golden Light Sphere<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Although Dongfang Zexuan was surprised to see that Chu Feng had charged at him, he was not afraid. Instead, he coldly snorted. The way he saw it, Chu Feng&rsquo;s decision of attacking him first was simply akin to striking a stone with an egg.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~~&rdquo;<br>Dongfang Zexuan raised the blade in his left hand and horizontally blocked the top of his head. Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword hacked down explosively. As the two weapons collided, it unleashed a magnificent spark.<br>Dongfang Zexuan had managed to successfully block Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword.<br>However, it was clear that he was not satisfied with only this. At the same time he blocked Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword, Dongfang Zexuan&rsquo;s foot moved. The blade in his right hand was thrust toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart like a dragon surging out of the sea.<br>His speed was extremely fast and nimble. His attack was very firm and decisive. This caused the eyes of everyone present to shine with shock. In merely an instant, they had experienced with their eyes the absolute strength of the Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Third Prince.<br>This was the Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Third Prince, one of the top geniuses in the entire Holy Land of Martialism.<br>&ldquo;Heh.&rdquo;<br>However, facing Dongfang Zexuang&rsquo;s fiery attack, Chu Feng only uttered a light laugh. Without dodging the attack, he shook the sword in his hand lightly. Then, with a &lsquo;bang,&rsquo; the flames that covered the sword left the sword and rushed to attack Dongfang Zexuan like a wave of fire.<br>&ldquo;Damn it.&rdquo;<br>Dongfang Zexuan was overwhelmed with shock. He did not expect that the spirit formation flame sword in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand was not only capable of increasing his battle power, it was also capable of turning the flames that covered the sword into a long range attack.<br>This sort of situation caused him to have no choice but to give up on attacking Chu Feng. He retrieved the blade that he was trying to thrust into Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart and stepped to the side to dodge the wave of flames.<br>However, the wave of flames continued to chase Dongfang Zexuan after he dodged, as it was still being controlled by Chu Feng, .<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Seeing that he was unable to dodge the flame, Dongfang Zexuan began to wave one of the Blades in his hand around, turning it into a flame shield to block the incoming wave of flames.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not over yet.&rdquo;<br>Yet, at the same time that the wave of flames was blocked, a chilly sensation arrived at Dongfang Zexuan&rsquo;s back.<br>It was Chu Feng; Chu Feng had followed the wave of flames. He was pressing hard on Dongfang Zexuan.<br>&ldquo;Damn it.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, Dongfang Zexuan felt as if there was a fierce wolf before him and a ferocious tiger behind him. He was stuck in a dilemma with no way out.<br>However, Dongfang Zexuan was no ordinary character either. During this moment of crisis, he was able to make his decision.<br>Since he was being attacked from both the front and the back, he decided to just face Chu Feng head on.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>After making his decision, Dongfang Zexuan started to attack. He began to brandish the two blades in his hands. Like two fire dragons, one blocked the wave of flames before him and the other blocked Chu Feng behind him. He had started to fight Chu Feng head on.<br>&ldquo;Not bad. This Dongfang Zexuan&rsquo;s battle experience is the strongest amongst all of the people I have met from the younger generation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fortunately, I am only competing against him with world spirit techniques. If we were to compete in battle power, then, with his cultivation, I would definitely be no match for him. I would only be able to fight against him if I were of the same cultivation as him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, to dare humiliate my Lil Mei, I do not care who you are, I will still defeat you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had also realized how powerful Dongfang Zexuan was. He knew that he was an opponent who could not be underestimated. Indeed, he was a super genius, a person many times more powerful than Qin Lingyun and Lin Yezhou.<br>However, Chu Feng was not discouraged by that. Receiving the benefit of the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram, Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques had become extremely powerful. Among those of his same level, he was practically unequalled. Thus, Chu Feng was naturally not afraid of Dongfang Zexuan.<br>Furthermore, through his journey in the Nine Provinces Continent to the Eastern Sea Region and finally the Holy Land of Martialism, Chu Feng had experienced a lot of battles and encountered a great amount of powerful opponents.<br>In terms of battle techniques, Chu Feng was not at all weaker than Dongfang Zexuan. On top of that, his current world spirit techniques were more powerful than Dongfang Zexuan&rsquo;s. Thus, since the very moment the two of them started fighting, it was destined that Chu Feng would possess absolute superiority.<br>&ldquo;Inconceivable! This Feng Chu has actually grasped such powerful spirit formations? Where exactly did he learn those spirit formations? I have simply never seen or heard of such formations before. They are absolutely not our World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s spirit formations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. The fact that his flame armor and flame sword were able to increase his battle power is already very extraordinary. However, the flame on the sword was actually able to transform itself to attack at a long range and the wings on the armor are able to increase his speed. This is truly too astonishing!&rdquo;<br>The people from the World Spiritist Alliance were all stunned with expressions of astonishment all over their faces.<br>The flames on Dongfang Zexuan&rsquo;s dual blades formation and armor formation were merely for ornamental purposes. Yet, the ones on Feng Chu&rsquo;s armor and sword were not. They actually possessed actual usage.<br>Spirit formations like those were truly too powerful. Not to mention grasping those spirit formations, the people from the World Spiritist Alliance had simply never seen them before.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that such an extraordinary disciple was hidden within our World Spiritist Alliance. Not mentioning the astonishing spirit formations that he has grasped, his close range battle techniques are also extremely powerful and not at all weaker than Dongfang Zexuan&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly who is this child? Exactly what is his background? Why haven&rsquo;t I ever heard of him before?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To have such an extraordinarily powerful disciple appear in our World Spiritist Alliance all of a sudden, I wonder if this is something good or bad.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, not to mention the ordinary elders and disciples of the World Spiritist Alliance, even the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master and the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly&rsquo;s elders were stunned.<br>At the moment when the people from the World Spiritist Alliance were feeling delighted, the Dongfang Imperial Clan was naturally feeling depressed. No matter what, they had never imagined that the World Spiritist Alliance would possess such a powerful genius who was actually able to suppress their Third Prince in terms of world spirit techniques.<br>Although the people from the Dongfang Imperial Clan were depressed, they were not very worried. It was as if they had absolute confidence in their Third Prince.<br>In fact, compared to the Dongfang Imperial Clan, the people from the Jadewater Temple, Firerain Hall and the Eight Desolate Mountain Ranges were looking even more miserable.<br>It was one thing for there to be a Su Mei. Yet, at this moment, another extremely powerful genius had appeared from the World Spiritist Alliance. Being also part of the Nine Powers, this was not at all good news to them.<br>After all, the strength of the disciples of the Nine Powers would determine their standing within the Nine Powers.<br>&ldquo;Senior Dongfang, the Third Prince, he couldn&rsquo;t possibly lose to this World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s boy, right?&rdquo; Filled with worry, one of the Jadewater Temple&rsquo;s elders cautiously asked an elder from the Dongfang Imperial Clan.<br>&ldquo;Humph, my clan&rsquo;s Third Prince, how could he possibly lose to someone like that?&rdquo; Said that Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s elder with a cold snort in a very displeasing manner.<br>&ldquo;Yes yes yes, how could the Third Prince lose to someone like that? I am overthinking things,&rdquo; Seeing that that elder was displeased, the Jadewater Temple&rsquo;s elder immediately started to smile apologetically.<br>Although both he and that Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s elder were peak Half Martial Emperors, he was extremely respectful and reverent towards that Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s elder. It was as if he were that elder&rsquo;s servant.<br>In fact, it was not only the Jadewater Temple&rsquo;s elders. The elders of the Eight Desolate Mountain Ranges and the Firerain Palace also did not dare to act disrespectfully towards the Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s elder.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a loud explosion was heard. Following that was a burst of violent energy ripples. As for the source of all that, it was the battle between Chu Feng and Dongfang Zexuan.<br>To be exact, it was Dongfang Zexuan that had caused it. At this moment, Dongfang Zexuan was covered by a golden sphere of light. Flickering with golden light, that sphere appeared even more dazzling in the darkened sky.<br>Not only was this golden light sphere very dazzling, it was also emitting layer upon layer of energy ripples nonstop.<br>The might of the energy ripples could not be underestimated. As they swept through the sky, even Chu Feng was forced to retreat several thousand meters away from it.<br>As for many of the disciples present with relatively low levels of cultivation, they were swept rolling and crawling by the energy ripples. Some among them were even wounded by them and started to vomit blood.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the elders of the World Spiritist Alliance promptly setting up defensive spirit formations, many of the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s disciples would have ended up dead or injured.<br></p></div>
