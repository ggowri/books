        <h1>Chapter 5603: Meeting Shengguang Xuanye Once More</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a dark-skinned old man with silver hair and a beard. He wore silver armor and a silver coronet. While his cultivation was not strong, he had a powerful disposition that intimidated others. He was none other than the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Shengguan Xuanye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, the Holy Valley had sentenced Shengguang Xuanye to be punished in the Revolution Prison, but his aide saved him, and he escaped from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. He regretted his actions before his escape and tried to get his subordinates to compensate the Chu Heavenly Clan, but Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t accept his goodwill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng thought that he would never meet Shengguang Xuanye ever again, but who could have thought that he would encounter the latter here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What a coincidence.&rdquo; Chu Feng glared at Shengguang Xuanye with infuriated eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He vividly remembered how Shengguang Xuanye had toyed with them back then, even going to the extent of disfiguring Long Xiaoxiao.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Things were different now, and Shengguang Xuanye, despite being an insurmountable enemy to the two of them back then, was now just a weak Martial Exalted level cultivator whom they could kill with a simple wave of their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Chu Feng was about to reveal himself, Long Xiaoxiao suddenly grabbed his wrist and shook his head, gesturing for him not to show himself just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a group of people surrounded Shengguang Xuanye and assessed him. In particular, there was a middle-aged man dressed in extravagant clothes and emanating an exceptionally powerful disposition. Despite his relatively young age, he was already a rank one Half-God level cultivator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man glanced at Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s waist token, which was inscribed with the words &lsquo;Holy Light Clan&rsquo;.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Holy Light Clan. Why have I never heard of this power? Where are you from?&rdquo; the middle-aged man asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More people gathered around to watch the spectacle. They looked at Shengguang Xuanye with eyes filled with hostility just because he stood up for the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I am from the Holy Light Galaxy,&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Holy Light Galaxy? I have never heard of that place before.&rdquo; The crowd looked at each other in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The Holy Light Galaxy is the Ancestral Martial Galaxy,&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Oh? Has the Ancestral Martial Galaxy changed its name? Isn&rsquo;t that something that only a galaxy overlord can do? Is your Holy Light Clan the Ancestral Martial Galaxy&rsquo;s new overlord? That explains why you have spoken up for the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How frightening! To think I am standing before the Ancestral Martial Galaxy&rsquo;s overlord! What should I do? We actually insulted him! Are we all going to die? I am terrified! Hahahaha!&rdquo; the middle-aged man sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shengguang Xuanye didn&rsquo;t lose his temper and instead said with a smile, &ldquo;I showed </span><span>myself to advise you not to go too far. Even if the Ancestral Martial Galaxy is in a weaker position now, it has no grudge against the other galaxies. We&rsquo;re all humans and cultivators. You don&rsquo;t have to say that we&rsquo;re cockroaches just because our cultivation is weaker. That&rsquo;s very disrespectful.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng scoffed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect Shengguang Xuanye to have such a side to him.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that it was ironic that Shengguang Xuanye had said those words, as he knew that the latter would have killed anyone who said such words to him in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. He was the type of person to abuse his power to do and say whatever he wanted, and he wouldn&rsquo;t stand for anyone refuting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shengguang Xuanye was only taking a gentler attitude here because he was no longer a galaxy overlord after leaving the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. He realized that he was nothing at all, a truly insignificant individual in a vast world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood how strength was the most important thing in the world of cultivation, for he had been the one who embraced it the most. That was how he had ruled over the Ancestral Martial Galaxy for many years, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he was now trying to talk sense into these people despite being the weaker one here. Even Chu Feng thought that it was laughable, let alone the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hahahaha!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd laughed with arrogance. They looked at Shengguang Xuanye as if he was a clown. The latter&rsquo;s smile slowly stiffened up, as displeasure started welling in his heart at being treated in such a manner despite being a galaxy overlord in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone suddenly threw out a fist toward Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s fist. The culprit was the rank one Half-God level middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being only at Martial Exalted level, Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s face distorted before the fist. He was alive only because the other party went easy on him, or else he would have been dead by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the middle-aged man didn&rsquo;t let things rest at just that. He grabbed Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s sleeves and tossed him onto the ground before descending himself to stamp his foot down on the latter&rsquo;s face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More spectators gathered around, but not a single person stopped the middle-aged man. They had already learned that Shengguang Xuanye was from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, and they saw the people there as no more than cockroaches. Naturally, they had no reason to interfere to save a cockroach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anything, it was more likely for them to join in and stamp the cockroach down instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng should have been pleased that Shengguang Xuanye was finally getting a taste of his medicine, but it made him feel uncomfortable that Shengguang Xuanye was suffering right now because he had stood up for the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Tell me, old man. Do you want to die?&rdquo; the middle-aged man asked with his leg pressing down on Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Naturally, I want to live,&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;If you want to live, I want you to say that all cultivators from the Ancestral Martial </span><span>Galaxy are trash and cockroaches!&rdquo; the middle-aged man said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shengguang Xuanye suddenly closed his eyes and moved his lips, but not a sound came out of his mouth. Chu Feng was the only one who could tell what he was saying from the movement of his lips, and a complicated expression appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What are you saying, old thing? Speak louder! I can&rsquo;t hear you,&rdquo; the middle-aged man shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shengguang Xuanye finally spoke with a booming voice that relayed his words loud and clear to everyone present, &ldquo;My life isn&rsquo;t worth anything. Take it if you want to. However, I can&rsquo;t insult the galaxy that has nurtured me. I am indeed useless, but not everyone there is the same as me. The Ancestral Martial Galaxy has powerful cultivators and outstanding juniors too, and they&rsquo;ll make you eat your words up.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words caught the attention of everyone around the Nine Realms Immortal Region, as they turned their eyes over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? What are they doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the middle-aged man didn&rsquo;t let things rest just because more people were turning their attention over. Instead, he glared at Shengguang Xuanye with eyes overflowing with a murderous will, for the latter had just said words he didn&rsquo;t want to hear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;A mere cockroach living in the dump is having delusions of grandeur. How could a place like that have prodigies? You&rsquo;re all nothing but a bunch of pests. Since you want to die that much, I&rsquo;ll fulfill your wish!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man raised his leg and stomped down on Shengguang Xuanye, seeking to take his life once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pu!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fresh blood spurted, but the crowd was taken aback. Shengguang Xuanye was still alive. The blood had come from the middle-aged man&rsquo;s severed thigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was confused, including Shengguang Xuanye and the middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man suddenly grabbed the middle-aged man by his throat and lifted him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s eyes widened in shock upon seeing the man. He couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes. A complicated expression seeped into his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he possibly not recognize Chu Feng?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t in the mood to bother with that. He looked at the middle-aged man, whom he was lifting with a single arm, as he asked, &ldquo;You said that everyone from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy are cockroaches. What does it make you to be treated by a cockroach in such a way?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man, who was held by Chu Feng, panicked so much upon hearing those words that his crotch area immediately turned wet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;M-m-m&hellip;&rdquo; The middle-aged man wanted to explain himself, but he was so terrified that he couldn&rsquo;t even enunciate clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because the middle-aged man was a rank one Half-God level cultivator didn&rsquo;t mean that he had guts. In the face of death, his behavior was far more unseemly than Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s. He had arrogantly insulted the Ancestral Martial Galaxy earlier, only to be scared out of his wits now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng sneered. He tightened his grip, and with a &lsquo;pah&rsquo;, the middle-aged man was reduced to a bloodied mist. Just like that, the middle-aged man was dead!</span></p></div>
