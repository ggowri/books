        <div> - Extremely Expensive Exchange<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Are you doubting my ability to pay?&rdquo; Aunt Lian frowned slightly. She had managed to tell what Manager Tian was thinking.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. I would never be doubtful of a customer&rsquo;s ability to pay. Merely, I wish to verify it.&rdquo; Manager Tian said with a polite smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Aunt Lian did not bother with superfluous words. She directly took out her Cosmos Sack and threw it to Manager Tian. She asked, &ldquo;Regardless of what the highest selling price of the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones might be, if you are to sell all of the things here, not to mention thirty-eight Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones, they will be sufficient to purchase even a hundred Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones.&rdquo;<br>Manager Tian caught the Cosmos Sack and sensed the things contained within it. Then, he started grinning from ear to ear. He said, &ldquo;So your distinguished self is someone from the Nangong Imperial Clan. It is no wonder that you&rsquo;re this rich and imposing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is as you said. The treasures in your Cosmos Sack are extremely valuable. Unfortunately, you have still underestimated the highest price of the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones. I am not boasting about this. Merely, the total of the items contained in your Cosmos Sack is indeed capable of exchanging for thirty-eight Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones without an issue. However, they would truly not be able to exchange for a hundred Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones. Thirty-eight Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones is the most that they could exchange for.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What did you say? The items in my Cosmos Sack are only capable of exchanging for thirty-eight Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones at most?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Aunt Lian was extremely shocked.<br>&ldquo;I am not lying to you. If you do not believe me, you do not have to exchange them with me,&rdquo; Manager Tian said.<br>&ldquo;Forget about it. Contact the sellers and ask them whether they are willing. If they are willing, I will exchange them,&rdquo; Aunt Lian did not hesitate.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need. If your distinguished self really wishes to purchase them at this price, I am able to make the decision,&rdquo; Manager Tian displayed the smile of an unscrupulous businessman.<br>&ldquo;Do it,&rdquo; Aunt Lian said those two words. Even though she said them very bluntly, one could hear some complaint in her tone. In this sort of situation, everyone knew that Aunt Lian had been scammed. However, she willingly allowed herself to be scammed.<br>Even though she would be spending a lot more money to purchase these Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones at the highest price, she knew very well that it would be difficult to determine who it would be that would actually be able to purchase the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones should they end up on the auction. Even if she were to lose out on purchasing a single one, it would be a loss. Aunt Lian did not wish to take that risk.<br>&ldquo;In that case, your distinguished self, please wait a moment,&rdquo; Seeing that, Manager Tian put the Cosmos Sack away and turned to leave.<br>&ldquo;Aunt Lian, that man is a scammer. I refuse to believe that those Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones would be that expensive,&rdquo; After Manager Tian left, Nangong Baihe spoke in an extremely unreconciled manner. She should know roughly how many treasures were contained in Aunt Lian&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack.<br>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. To be able to help little friend Chu Feng obtain these Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones, this bit of money is nothing,&rdquo; Aunt Lian smiled lightly. Then, she took out three more Cosmos Sacks and said, &ldquo;I still have more. Later on, if you all are to see anything that you want, just tell Aunt Lian. As long as it&rsquo;s within my ability, Aunt Lian will help you all purchase them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Haha, Aunt Lian is amazing,&rdquo; After seeing that Aunt Lian still had more money, Nangong Baihe laughed happily.<br>As for Chu Feng, he also knew that Aunt Lian had been scammed. However, on their journey here, Aunt Lian had discussed about the matter of Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones deeply with him. She declared that, regardless of the price, she would be able to obtain the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones for Chu Feng. That was the reason why Chu Feng did not say anything about Aunt Lian&rsquo;s actions right now.<br>Not long afterward, that Manager Tian returned. He handed a Cosmos Sack to Aunt Lian. After receiving the Cosmos Sack, Aunt Lian lightly smiled, then handed it to Chu Feng.<br>When Chu Feng received the Cosmos Sack, he also displayed a brilliant smile. Even though this Cosmos Sack did not contain anything else, it did contain the thirty-eight Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones. Adding on the two Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones that Chu Feng already possessed, he now possessed forty Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones.<br>&ldquo;It would seem that your distinguished self needs Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones badly. Although I do not have any with me, I believe that our Heavenly Law Auction&rsquo;s guests will likely have them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If your distinguished self really needs Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones, I have a method that might be able to help you all obtain a bit more,&rdquo; Manager Tian said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;What method?&rdquo; Aunt Lian asked.<br>&ldquo;You all could try to auction some items with the condition of exchanging them only for Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones. Perhaps there might be guests who possess Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones who would encounter items that attract their interest. At that time, they would want to purchase those items with the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones,&rdquo; Manager Tian said as he looked to Aunt Lian with an eager smile. Evidently, he knew that Aunt Lian possessed more treasures.<br>&ldquo;Very well, go and auction all of the most precious items contained here with the condition of only exchanging them for Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones,&rdquo; After hearing those words, Aunt Lian did not hesitate, and took out the three Cosmos Sacks from earlier.<br>However, right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly spoke to stop Aunt Lian. &ldquo;Aunt Lian, you must not do that. You&rsquo;ve already spent a great amount of money to help me purchase these thirty-eight Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones. You&rsquo;ve treated me extremely well. I cannot have you spend more of your wealth on me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you still remember what I said before? This is nothing. Wealth and money are merely worldly possessions. The most important matter is the friendship between you and the Young Master and Misses,&rdquo; Aunt Lian smiled lightly. Then, she handed the three Cosmos Sacks to Manager Tian.<br>Manager Tian was very blunt. He immediately began to inspect the contents of the three Cosmos Sacks. After he finished inspecting them, he shook his head and said, &ldquo;If you still require sixty-two Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones, I&rsquo;m afraid that the items contained in these will not be enough.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What? They&rsquo;re still not enough?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Aunt Lian immediately frowned.<br>Even though the items contained in her three Cosmos Sacks could not be considered to be priceless, they were all extremely valuable treasures. With all these treasures, she was still unable to exchange them for a hundred Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones; exactly how precious were the Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones?<br>&ldquo;I am not lying to you. It is true that the items in your Cosmos Sacks are extremely valuable. However, it is generally only world spiritists who will keep Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones without selling them. What are the things that world spiritists require? They require items that are related to either world spirit techniques or world spirits. Only by encountering those items will they be willing to use their Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones in exchange.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While your Cosmos Sacks contain a lot of treasures, they do not contain a lot of treasures related to world spirit techniques or world spirits,&rdquo; As Manager Tian spoke, he took out five items from the three Cosmos Sacks. Each and every one of them were treasures that contained special power. Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that these five items were very precious, and possessed miraculous effects for world spirit techniques.<br>&ldquo;In your Cosmos Sacks, only these five items can be auctioned. If I were to help you price them for auction, and if someone were willing to purchase them, then they should be able to be exchanged for twenty Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones. However, of course, it might be possible that there might be many people who are fond of these items and who will end up fighting with one another. If that were to happen, the selling price would be higher.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if there is no one that needs them, you would not be able to exchange them for a single Dragon Mark World Spirit Stone. Are you certain that you want to auction them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are willing to auction them, I will not charge you any commission,&rdquo; Manager Tian&rsquo;s words this time were rather sincere. Likely, he had indeed managed to earn a whole lot from the exchange of the items from Aunt Lian&rsquo;s previous Cosmos Sack for thirty-eight Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones.<br>&ldquo;Do it,&rdquo; When Aunt Lian was willing to part with all three Cosmos Sacks, how could she not be willing to part with these mere five items?<br>&ldquo;Actually, the cloaks on your bodies are the true treasures. Might you all be interested in selling those? If you are, they would definitely be able to fetch a very high price,&rdquo; Manager Tian took a glance at the cloaks that Chu Feng and the others were wearing and said with a beaming smile.<br></p></div>
