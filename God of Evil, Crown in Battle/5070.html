        <div>: Unfair<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, in Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s confinement formation, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was once again pinned up under Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s maneuver.<br>Fortunately, the Lady of Dao Sea and Godwish Grandmother were around. Under their treatment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s condition improved significantly. His punctured body soon returned to normal. It was just that his soul had yet to recover, so his complexion remained awful.<br>In order to prevent Sima Xiangtu from overhearing their discussion, they set up a barrier within the confinement formation.<br>&ldquo;Master and elders, I was inept,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with his head hanging in shame.<br>&ldquo;What nonsense are you saying, Chu Feng? You have already done your best!&rdquo; Wang Yuxian quickly consoled him.<br>The Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea also did the same. They knew that Chu Feng was not to be blamed for their plight.<br>&ldquo;What do you have to be ashamed of? Jiang Yuantai is the one who should be ashamed!&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist suddenly said.<br>&ldquo;Master, what do you mean? Did Jiang Yuantai use special means to defeat me?&rdquo;Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course! There was a sharp increase in his fighting prowess two times in the battle. He must have consumed two forbidden medicines,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t sense any traces of forbidden medicine from him,&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea said.<br>That was also what everyone else was perplexed about. They had been keeping a close eye on the duel, but none of them noticed any traces of forbidden medicine at all.<br>&ldquo;The Pill Dao Immortal Sect specializes in forging pills. All young masters of notable standing in the Pill Dao Immortal Sect would receive precious forbidden medicine that is both discreet and comes with minimal side effects.<br>&ldquo;Of course, this forbidden medicine is not easy to forge. The ingredients required are exorbitant, and the process is incredibly convoluted too. For that reason, this forbidden medicine isn&rsquo;t available to ordinary sect members, and the Pill Dao Immortal Sect doesn&rsquo;t sell it to outsiders either. That&rsquo;s why few people know about its existence,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Despicable! So much for his talk about having a fair duel, but he actually resorted to forbidden medicine!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Indeed, he&rsquo;s despicable.&rdquo;<br>Both Wang Yuxian and Princess Xiaoxiao berated Jiang Yuantai. The Ox-nosed Daoist chuckled at that sight.<br>&ldquo;My disciple truly has luck with women. I&rsquo;m truly no match for you on that aspect,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist teased.<br>Both Wang Yuxian and Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s faces reddened, not knowing how to respond to those words. Their embarrassment quelled their anger.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing as fairness in this world. His so-called fairness is nothing more than a pretense to make others acknowledge his strength. This has never been a fair duel from the very start. I dare say that he has devoted a huge amount of time to training his spearmanship. No one else other than my disciple would have been able to withstand that spear of his,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;His spearmanship is indeed formidable. It appears ordinary at first glance, but it comes together to form a formation. Now that I think about it, his speed and spear are most likely augmented by a spear skill. It isn&rsquo;t just his raw strength,&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea agreed.<br>&ldquo;I wonder if there&rsquo;s any forbidden medicine in here too. Master, are you able to open this Cosmos Sack?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng took out a Cosmos Sack and passed it over to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. This was the Cosmos Sack he had snatched from Jiang Kongping, but unfortunately, none of them had been able to open it thus far.<br>While the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s spirit power was nowhere in comparison to the Lady of Dao Sea and the Godwish Grandmother, he seemed to know a lot of things and possess exceptional means. Just his feat of fusing the Four Symbols Divine Power into his body was something that ordinary world spiritists wouldn&rsquo;t be able to pull off.<br>That was also why Chu Feng thought that his master might be able to pull off what the others couldn&rsquo;t.<br>&ldquo;Where did you get this Cosmos Sack from?&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Jiang Kongping, a young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for me to look at it. All young masters of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect use a recognition formation for it,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied.<br>&ldquo;Recognition formation? I didn&rsquo;t find anything like that on it.&rdquo;<br>The Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea began examining the Cosmos Sack once again. They hadn&rsquo;t been able to find any recognition formation on it the last time they inspected the Cosmos Sack.<br>As the name suggested, recognition formation was a type of sealing formation that only unlocked upon sensing its master&rsquo;s aura. Unless one&rsquo;s spirit power was superior to the person who constructed the formation, it would be impossible to forcefully break it open.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, open my Cosmos Sack. You should be able to find a black pill with a star imprint on it. Consume it and try imitating Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s aura. You should be able to open that Cosmos Sack now,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist instructed.<br>Chu Feng quickly did as he was told. He found a black pill in the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack and consumed it. Then, he used his spirit power to copy Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s aura.<br>The pill helped Chu Feng better copy the aura of others. Together with Chu Feng&rsquo;s superior skills as a world spiritist and the fact that he was a junior, he was able to copy Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s aura with a high degree of resemblance.<br>It was time to verify whether this was sufficient to trick the Cosmos Sack.<br>Everyone watched intently as Chu Feng released his aura, wanting to see if the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s words rang true.<br>Weng!<br>Shockingly, the seemingly indestructible formation began unraveling the moment it sensed Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura. The Cosmos Sack opened up!<br>&ldquo;Master, you&rsquo;re as formidable as ever,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked in awe.<br>&ldquo;Take all of the items out of the Cosmos Sack or else it&rsquo;ll soon close on its own accord. Without my pill, you won&rsquo;t be able to open the Cosmos Sack no matter how well you copy Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s aura,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist instructed.<br>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng quickly did as he was told.<br>There weren&rsquo;t many items in Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack, filled with mostly unusually flashy and revealing clothes intended for men. However, there was an ordinary-looking wooden box that contained three pills.<br></p></div>
