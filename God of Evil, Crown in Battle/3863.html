        <h1>Chapter 3862</h1>
        <div> - Arriving At the Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the time when Tuoba Chengan and the other All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s elders were about to vomit blood from anger, Chu Feng had already left the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>There were also a group of people accompanying him.<br>They were the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Say, brother Asura, did you really use canine excrement for that spirit formation of yours?&rdquo;<br>Haha. If that&rsquo;s true, I bet those people from the All-heaven Sect were all angered to death by you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That bunch are all arrogant people who believe themselves to be so important and above everyone. Especially in the All-heaven Starfield, they simply consider themselves to be gods.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Indeed. Even if the dog shit is unable to reach them, the stench should be able to disgust them.&rdquo;<br>After the Mystic Cave Saints learned that Chu Feng had actually left behind such a spirit formation to mess with the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s elders, they all rejoiced at their misfortune.<br>&ldquo;That said, brother Asura, what you&rsquo;ve done will set you against the All-heaven Sect, and make you an irreconcilable enemy of theirs,&rdquo; said the Eleventh of the Mystic Cave Saints all of a sudden.<br>Even though he was the youngest of the Mystic Cave Saints, he was much older than Chu Feng. Because of that, even he addressed Chu Feng as brother.<br>Of course, the reason for the change in the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; behavior was because Chu Feng was currently their ally.<br>&ldquo;We are irreconcilable enemies to begin with," said Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng did not specify things clearly.<br>Only he knew that the All-heaven Sect had already been his enemy before he even travelled to the All-heaven Starfield.<br>They were the ones in the wrong first. Thus, Chu Feng would show no mercy towards them.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, you actually didn&rsquo;t have to lay your cards to them at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as you didn&rsquo;t reveal your origin, they would have continued to think that you were supported by experts, or a major power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;More or less, they would have had a restraining fear of you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;By directly revealing your cards now, they will now attack you without any fear,&rdquo; said the Eleventh of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless. Since that All-heaven Sect dared to dispatch their men to assassinate our brother Asura, it proves that they cannot tolerate brother Asura being unrestrained in the All-heaven Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although their first assassination attempt failed, it revealed to them that brother Asura is not protected by any expert.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, there will naturally be a second, or even a third assassination attempt. They will continue until brother Asura is killed&hellip;&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, then it would indeed not matter if brother Asura directly reveals his cards to them,&rdquo; the others from the Mystic Cave Saints agreed.<br>&ldquo;While it would indeed not matter for brother Asura to directly reveal his cards to the All-heaven Sect; brother Asura, you are, no matter what, a guest invited by the Red-dress Holy Land. Furthermore, I can tell that you have quite a friendship with that lass from the Red-dress Holy Land. Otherwise, you wouldn&rsquo;t have helped them take us on.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you not afraid that the All-heaven Sect will cause trouble for the Red-dress Holy Land because of what you&rsquo;ve done?&rdquo; asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;They won't,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>The reason why Chu Feng said that was because he already knew what had happened to Song Yichen.<br>He had learned from Yin Zhuanghong that even though it was the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s Supreme Elder Cheng Hui that was disguised as Song Yichen, all of Chen Hui&rsquo;s clothing, title plate and even the contents in his Cosmos Sack belonged to Elder Song Yichen.<br>For Cheng Hui to be able to gain so many of Song Yichen&rsquo;s possessions, it most likely meant that she had already been killed.<br>In fact, when Elder Song Yichen had first disappeared, the people from the Red-dress Holy Land had already suspected that her disappearance might have something to do with the All-heaven Sect.<br>After all, Elder Song Yichen went to do one thing before her disappearance.<br>That thing was very dangerous, and concerned the interests of both the All-heaven Sect and the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Because of Elder Song Yichen&rsquo;s disappearance, the Red-dress Holy Land had already realized that the All-heaven Sect would very likely try to eliminate them.<br>Thus, even if Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t set himself against the All-heaven Sect, the All-heaven Sect would not have spared the Red-dress Holy Land either.<br>Likely, the All-heaven Sect was still holding back against attacking the Red-dress Holy Land due to some considerations.<br>However, battle between them was inevitable.<br>That was also the reason why Chu Feng had decided to openly make himself an enemy of the All-heaven Sect.<br>Since the people from the All-heaven Sect wouldn&rsquo;t possibly spare him anyways, he might as well infuriate them more.<br>After leaving the Red-dress Holy Land, Chu Feng proceeded for a place with the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>That place was the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>The Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb was located on a vast plain.<br>That plain was abnormally desolate.<br>Yellow dust was flying everywhere, and trees were extremely sparse. Furthermore, no trace of life could be seen.<br>Although that place was not a desert, it was practically no different from a desert.<br>It was truly a barren land.<br>However, deep within this barren land was a mountain range densely covered by greenery.<br>Ahead of the mountain range was an isolated mountain.<br>That mountain was not connected to the mountain range. Furthermore, it was very tall.<br>That isolated mountain was much higher than the highest point of the mountain range.<br>Although the mountain range was enormous, it was completely beneath the clouds.<br>As for that isolated mountain, it pierced through the clouds, and seemed to scale the heavens.<br>The mountain range was covered densely with greenery. Singing birds, fragrant flowers, flowing waters, wild beasts and ferocious beasts were all over the mountain range.<br>Apart from the birdsongs, one could occasionally hear roars that shook heaven and earth.<br>Even though the plain was completely barren, the mountain range was filled with vitality.<br>Because of that, the mountain range created a clear-cut contrast with the plain.<br>Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints arrived by air. Thus, they were able to witness everything clearly.<br>Looking down from above, they were able to see that the vast and boundless continuous mountain range faintly resembled a person.<br>That was a person lying on the plain.<br>If one were to look closely, one would notice the trees changing too. In fact, one could even faintly make out the silhouette of that person.<br>The isolated mountain that pierced through the clouds also indicated what sort of place this was.<br>The reason for that was because the words &lsquo;Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb&rsquo; were engraved on that mountain.<br>That mountain was actually the tombstone.<br>As for the continuous mountain range behind it, it was the burial ground of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor.<br>That place was the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb!!!<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, did you manage to make out anything?&rdquo; Seeing Chu Feng standing in midair motionlessly for a long time, and sizing up the mountain range repeatedly with his seemingly ordinary eyes, the Mystic Cave Saints guessed that Chu Feng must be using a special observation method to examine the mountain range.<br>Because of that, they all arrived before Chu Feng and began to ask him if he had detect anything.<br>&ldquo;This place is truly miraculous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though the mountain range is covered in greenery, the mountain range will be transformed into the form of a human should one pay close attention.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The power of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor fills every corner of the mountain range.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The inside of the mountain range is a profound mystery. It's no wonder the All-heaven Sect is unable to enter the tomb even after so long.&rdquo;<br>After examining the mountain range, Chu Feng praised it nonstop.<br>His praises also revealed how remarkable of a place the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb was.<br></p></div>
