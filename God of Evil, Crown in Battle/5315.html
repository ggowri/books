        <h1>Chapter 5316</h1>
        <div>: I Want To Team Up With Chu Feng<br>&ldquo;The One who has opened the Half-God Gate, you may choose one of the five objects,&rdquo; an ancient voice echoed.<br>The voice came from all directions and converged into Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears. As those words were spoken, five gates suddenly appeared in front of Chu Feng. These five gates were much smaller than the entrance of the Sacred Heavenly Temple, but they still stood imposingly at a thousand meters tall.<br>Each of these five doors had a plaque hanging above them. These plaques showed beautiful calligraphy written with powerful strokes. While the five calligraphy appeared to have been done by the same person, their contents differed.<br>They were &lsquo;Martial Cultivation&rsquo;, &lsquo;Formation&rsquo;, &lsquo;World Spirit&rsquo;, &lsquo;Armament&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Treasure&rsquo;.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, choose &lsquo;Martial Cultivation&rsquo;! If you dare choose &lsquo;World Spirit&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ll smack you to oblivion!&rdquo; Eggy exclaimed.<br>She was worried that Chu Feng would choose &lsquo;World Spirit&rsquo; to acquire treasures to help her. She knew that Chu Feng was already on the verge of a breakthrough, and &lsquo;Martial Cultivation&rsquo; could very well offer him the martial power he needed for the final push.<br>This was the Half-God level Sacred Heavenly Temple, after all. Any resources for martial cultivation obtained here were likely to be enough to satisfy Chu Feng&rsquo;s needs.<br>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll choose &lsquo;Martial Cultivation&rsquo;. However, if I obtain the other two Half-God level Sacred Temple Beads too, I&rsquo;ll definitely pick &lsquo;World Spirit&rsquo; at least once,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Fine. We&rsquo;ll talk about it later on. Stop dawdling around and make your choice,&rdquo; Eggy urged impatiently.<br>Thus, Chu Feng picked &lsquo;Martial Cultivation&rsquo;.<br>Weng!<br>He was immediately teleported into a massive hall that was much grander than the one before. At the center of the hall was an elevated platform with an orb floating on it. Words could be seen inscribed on the elevated platform&mdash;Half-God level Martial Power Orb.<br>That was the name of the orb.<br>Chu Feng was relieved that he acquired a martial power resource, which happened to be what he needed the most right now. He reached out and grabbed the orb.<br>Weng!<br>Before he knew it, Chu Feng had already returned to the real world. In his hands was the Half-God level Martial Power Orb.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you able to assimilate it right now?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a little difficult. This orb is made specifically for Half-God level cultivators. However, I can give it a try,&rdquo; Chu Feng said before diving right into the task.<br>Moments later, he burst into hearty laughter and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s working, Eggy! I&rsquo;ll be able to assimilate it in a night&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hurry up and assimilate it!&rdquo; Eggy urged joyfully.<br>Chu Feng devoted his full attention to assimilating the martial power orb. By the following morning, he had already fully absorbed its energy.<br>&ldquo;How is it? Are you able to make a breakthrough?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;Not yet. I&rsquo;m still lacking a little, but that&rsquo;s not a problem,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he took out the Dragon Inner Core. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost done refining the Dragon Inner Core. I should be able to make a breakthrough once I assimilate its energy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Good. The Half-God level Sacred Temple Bead hasn&rsquo;t gone to waste then. Speaking of which, you really must thank Miss Bai for this. Anyone else in her place would have definitely not given such a valuable treasure to you,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I have to properly thank her for this,&rdquo; Chu Feng agreed.<br>All of a sudden, a person knocked on Chu Feng&rsquo;s door. It was Elder Lai, the one who had stopped the fight between Mo Wuxiang and Xia Xingchen.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, allow me to introduce myself. I am Lai Sheng, the leader of the Lai Lineage Tribe,&rdquo; Elder Lai introduced himself with a smile. His attitude was extremely amicable.<br>&ldquo;Please enter, Elder Lai,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Elder Lai noticed that the tables and chairs inside the palace were stacked together to form a little hut, and Little Crescent was sleeping at the bottom of the structure. It went without saying that this was Little Crescent&rsquo;s doing. Children liked to do such stuff.<br>However, there was a soft cushion at the very bottom of the constructed hut. It was made out of spirit power, and it wasn&rsquo;t something that was originally inside the palace. Elder Lai knew right away that Chu Feng was the one who placed it there.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, why don&rsquo;t you get Little Crescent to rest inside one of the rooms?&rdquo; Elder Lai asked out of curiosity.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking that she might find the little hut she built more comfortable than the room,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That makes sense.&rdquo; Elder Lai nodded in agreement. He grabbed a chair and sat down on it. &ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll get straight to the point. Why did you choose to aid the Yuan Lineage Tribe?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The first people I met after entering the Ancient Realm were from the Yuan Lineage Tribe. None of them welcomed me, and most of them seemed to have lost their minds. They were afraid of me. I couldn&rsquo;t gather any information from them at all. It was Little Crescent who told me where to go,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Little Crescent knew the road here?&rdquo; Elder Lai asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes. She told me that she saw a map in one of the rooms, but she couldn&rsquo;t remember which room it was anymore. I had no choice but to follow her directions as it was my only hope. Otherwise, I would have been eliminated if I failed to reach the test location on time,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a bitter smile.<br>He appeared to be blaming the Ancient Realm for doing nothing about his plight.<br>Elder Lai noticed Chu Feng&rsquo;s dissatisfaction and explained, &ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, we had our own difficulties too. I hope that you&rsquo;ll forgive us for that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I cleared the test anyway,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, does that mean that you have chosen to bind with the Yuan Lineage Tribe out of gratitude for Little Crescent?&rdquo; Elder Lai thought that the reason made perfect sense, so he didn&rsquo;t dwell too much on it. &ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, did you see anyone else in the Yuan Lineage Tribe? Is there anyone whom Little Crescent is close to?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. The only normal person I saw was Little Crescent.&rdquo;<br>There was no way Chu Feng would divulge the truth. The fact that Elder Lai was asking about this showed that they were concerned about the happenings over at the Yuan Lineage Tribe. Instead, he asked a question,&rdquo; Elder, what happened with the Yuan Lineage Tribe?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t hide the truth from you. A huge battle happened with them. I know that Little Crescent might look obedient and adorable, but the Yuan Lineage Tribe&rsquo;s leader and tribesmen are all frightening people. They nearly destroyed the Ancient Realm. It&rsquo;s fortunate that we won the battle under our chief&rsquo;s leadership.<br>&ldquo;We would have destroyed the Yuan Lineage Tribe under normal circumstances. What they have done is not deserving of forgiveness. Nevertheless, our chief still spared them out of the kindness of his heart.<br>&ldquo;To be honest with you, young hero Chu Feng, what you have achieved yesterday was amazing. The tribe you are bound with will attain many benefits for that&hellip; but it&rsquo;s a huge pity that it&rsquo;s going to the Yuan Lineage Tribe. However, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. What&rsquo;s done is done. Actually, I came here to inform you that the second test is about to begin. I&rsquo;m tasked to bring you there,&rdquo; Elder Lai said.<br>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Chu Feng rose to his feet, but he shot a glance at Little Crescent. &ldquo;Elder, the juniors are innocent even if the adults have committed atrocities.&rdquo;<br>He was worried that the others might harm Little Crescent once he was gone.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, young hero Chu Feng. Our Ancient Realm isn&rsquo;t that heartless,&rdquo; Elder Lai replied.<br>&ldquo;Elder, can I leave Little Crescent to rest here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ll have someone take care of Little Crescent. I promise you that she&rsquo;ll be as lively as ever when you return from the test.&rdquo;<br>Elder Lai was making a promise to Chu Feng that he would keep Little Crescent safe. This was a huge promise, especially considering the animosity that the other tribes had toward the Yuan Lineage Tribe.<br>Chu Feng followed Elder Lai to the square where they had the talent assessment the day before. The area was already crowded by the time he arrived. Bai Yunqing and the other challengers, the tribe leaders, and even the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief were already there.<br>Chu Feng was the last one to arrive.<br>Unlike yesterday, there were four spirit formation gates in the square.<br>&ldquo;What airs. You expect everyone to wait here for you,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.<br>&ldquo;Pardon me. We were late because I had matters to discuss with young hero Chu Feng,&rdquo; Elder Lai explained.<br>Bai Yunqing immediately shut his mouth. He had seen how strong Elder Lai was, and he had an inkling as to how high Elder Lai&rsquo;s standing in the Ancient Realm was. It wouldn&rsquo;t be wise for him to offend such a powerful person.<br>&ldquo;Since everyone is already present, I shall explain the rules of the second round. I&rsquo;ll be troubling our young heroes here to form a team with our juniors to challenge the test inside the spirit formation gate. The duration of the test is twelve hours. As long as you&rsquo;re able to get out within twelve hours, you&rsquo;ll be deemed to have cleared the test.<br>&ldquo;There are only four spirit formation gates, so you&rsquo;ll be divided into four teams. Young hero Chu Feng, young hero Zhou Dong, and young hero Qin Shu, you&rsquo;ll be leading a team each. Young hero Jia Chengying and young hero Bai Yunqing, you&rsquo;ll be leading a team together,&rdquo; the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief announced.<br>Jia Chengying immediately raised a question. &ldquo;Lord Chief, why do I have to lead a team together with Brother Bai when Chu Feng gets to lead a team by himself?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young hero Jia, the arrangement was decided based on the results of yesterday&rsquo;s talent assessment,&rdquo; the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief replied.<br>Jia Chengying was rendered speechless. Chu Feng had hogged the limelight yesterday, whereas he and Bai Yunqing utterly embarrassed themselves.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chief, can I be in the same team as young hero Chu Feng instead?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked. &ldquo;While Brother Chu Feng is highly talented, he&rsquo;s still lacking in terms of his cultivation. I fear that he&rsquo;ll struggle to protect himself and the juniors of the Ancient Realm in the test. Thus, I wish to follow Brother Chu Feng and help him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s up to young hero Chu Feng to decide.&rdquo; The Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief turned to seek Chu Feng&rsquo;s opinion, giving him ample respect.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine with it,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>He knew that Bai Yunqing was up to no good, but he wasn&rsquo;t worried at all. After all, he had Eggy to back him up!<br></div>
