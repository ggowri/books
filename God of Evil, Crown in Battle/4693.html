        <h1>Chapter 4692</h1>
        <div>: The Stellar Rabbit Tribe<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hua Xu was gleeful to hear those words. He thought that the elder was siding with him here.<br>But unexpectedly, after berating Chu Feng, the elder turned his gaze to Hua Xu and said, &ldquo;Hua Xu, you shouldn&rsquo;t think that you can do as you please just because you did well for your test. You can be expelled for failing to observe the rules of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect too.&rdquo;<br>The elder berated Hua Xu without any hesitation too.<br>&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo;<br>Hua Xu was displeased to hear the elder&rsquo;s words, but he didn&rsquo;t dare to say anything, especially since he hadn&rsquo;t gotten into the East Dragon Hall yet. However, he had no intention of letting the grudge go just because of this.<br>He sent an angry voice transmission to Chu Feng, &ldquo;You sure are audacious to dare to speak up to me. Do you think that Duan Liufeng will be able to protect you? Let me tell you this, your end is near for daring to stand against me! I&rsquo;ll make sure that you suffer in the days to come!&rdquo;<br>On the other hand, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t bother responding to Hua Xu&rsquo;s cheap provocation. He simply shot him a contemptuous smile, which only further enraged Hua Xu.<br>Even though Chu Feng and Hua Xu had stopped bickering, the disciples and elders present were still chatting fervently with one another. They felt that Chu Feng was too foolish to ruin his own future.<br>While they were all juniors who had yet to officially join the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, the earlier test results were more than enough to decree the divergence in their paths. Chu Feng was bound to become a humble disciple of the North Tortoise Hall whereas Hua Xu would soar through the ranks in the East Dragon Hall.<br>The eventual outcome of this conflict was clear for all to see.<br>&ldquo;Waaa, what a beautiful woman! Is she the Monstrous Clan?&rdquo;<br>Awed exclamations suddenly sounded amongst the juniors. Chu Feng turned his sights over, only to see an old man flying over with a young woman.<br>The old man was an elder of the outer hall and had nothing special to him, but the young woman beside him caught everyone&rsquo;s eyes in an instant.<br>She was from the Monstrous Clan, evidenced by the pair of furry rabbit ears on her head. However, she was morphed into the appearance of a human at the moment, and she was extremely beautiful.<br>She had smooth, tender skin that looked like the surface of an egg, and there was a star insignia on her forehead, making her stand out from the crowd. She had a young appearance, but she had a curvaceous figure. The snowy legs peeking out of her fluttering brilliant red dress looked enticing, leaving the men on the square drooling.<br>The crowd swiftly realized that she should be as young as she looked too, unlike some cultivators who intentionally altered their appearances to look younger. On top of that, she hadn&rsquo;t concealed her aura, so everyone could gauge her cultivation level.<br>Rank nine Exalted level.<br>Despite her young age, she had already reached<br>Exalted level, making her far stronger than Hua Xu.<br>&ldquo;That old thing was actually so lucky to find such a genius?&rdquo;<br>The outer elders looked at the rabbit-eared woman with displeased looks on their faces. Their envy was written all over their faces.<br>Even though the rabbit-eared woman had yet to test her abilities, there was no doubt that she would perform well given her level of cultivation at her age.<br>Even at worst, she would induce gray light from the stone platforms, though it was more likely that her results would be on par with that of Hua Xu.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, it looks like we&rsquo;re really fated with one another.&rdquo;<br>However, a figure suddenly rose into the air and stepped into the young woman&rsquo;s path. Everyone was a little surprised by this because the figure was no other than Hua Xu.<br>&ldquo;Do I know you?&rdquo;<br>The woman blinked her eyes in confusion as she assessed Hua Xu carefully.<br>&ldquo;We might not know one another previously, but we will soon become acquainted with one another. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, you&rsquo;re from the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s Stellar Rabbit Tribe, right?&rdquo;<br>Hua Xu spoke fawningly as he eyed the young woman&rsquo;s body intently.<br>&ldquo;Monstrous Herd Temple?&rdquo;<br>Those words immediately caused the faces of the juniors present to warp in astonishment. The gazes they directed toward the young woman became respectful.<br>There was hardly anyone in the Holy Light Galaxy who didn&rsquo;t know of the Monstrous Herd Temple. It was one of the strongest powers here, second to only the Holy Light Clan.<br>The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect might not care much about the Monstrous Herd Temple, but the juniors who had just arrived here couldn&rsquo;t help but feel deferential toward it.<br>&ldquo;You have sharp eyes. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;<br>The young woman was rather pleased to see that someone actually knew of her, which made her quite curious about Hua Xu too.<br>&ldquo;My name is Hua Xu. I&rsquo;m from the Lionflower Monstrous Tribe,&rdquo; Hua Xu introduced himself.<br>&ldquo;Oh&hellip; The Lionflower Monstrous Tribe. Yes, I do know of them. It&rsquo;s the Monstrous Tribe who has tribed to join the Monstrous Herd Temple many times but to no avail, right? In other words, you&rsquo;re a Flower Monstrous Beast too?&rdquo;<br>The young woman eyed Hua Xu with a teasing look in her eyes.<br>Needless to say, Hua Xu felt offended by those words. It had left him in an awkward position. However, out of deference to the young woman&rsquo;s position, he dared not to pull his weight, so he tried to laugh it off awkwardly instead.<br>&ldquo;Alright, fellow brother from the Lionflower Monstrous Tribe. You need to get out of my way right now. I&rsquo;ll take the test first before coming over to play with you.&rdquo;<br>As the young woman said those words, she patted Hua Xu&rsquo;s shoulders. Her candid attitude won her goodwill from Hua Xu, who mistakenly thought that the young woman was interested in him. His earlier displeasure disappeared right away.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be waiting for you then,&rdquo; Hua Xu replied fawningly.<br>The young woman quickly descended onto the square while scanning the crowd around her. Her beautiful appearance and her identity as a member of the Monstrous Herd Temple made her dazzling in the eyes of the juniors present. Men who fell in the line of her gaze couldn&rsquo;t help but feel their heartbeat hastening, and some of their faces even reddened.<br>She intended to just take a quick look, but when her eyes fell on Chu Feng, she suddenly paused in place. Shock swiftly filledher face.<br>&ldquo;My gosh! Chu Feng? Is it you, Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>The young woman quickly passed through the crowd and rushed over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side. It looked almost as if she was ready to leap right into Chu Feng&rsquo;s embrace.<br>Just as she was about to reach him, she suddenly recalled something and halted her footsteps. However, her eyes were still assessing him intently.<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it. It really is you! How could I be so lucky as to meet you here?&rdquo;<br>Upon ascertaining Chu Feng&rsquo;s identity, she was so excited that she began hopping all around the place. Her exaggerated reaction left everyone present utterly confused.<br>And when Chu Feng finally began speaking with the young woman, the crowd only found themselves even more shocked.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, do I know you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only natural that you don&rsquo;t recognize a small fry like me! However, there&rsquo;s no way I could possibly not know of you!&rdquo;<br>It was almost as if she was a fangirl meeting her idol. Her eyes were filled with excitement and reverence.<br></p></div>
