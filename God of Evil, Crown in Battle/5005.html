        <div>: Guidance of the Divine Vat<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Milord, is the fusion of Netherworld Embryos something good?&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course! If it works out, not only will she be able to preserve her life, but she&rsquo;ll wield limitless potential for her future. The experiment that I mentioned earlier was done with the purpose of inducing the fusion of Netherworld Embryos, but it&rsquo;s already hard to find an individual who can withstand two Netherworld Embryos, let alone fuse them together.&rdquo;<br>The Netherworld Envoy started explaining in greater detail out of excitement.<br>According to him, the purpose of planting Netherworld Embryo into the bodies of talented children was to boost their talents and have those children grow together with the Netherworld Embryos. In the end, they would be able to tap into the power of the Netherworld Embryos to rise to even greater heights.<br>Just a single Netherworld Embryo was enough to bring a single cultivator to the top echelon of the world of cultivation, let alone two. To use a metaphor, it was similar to a person possessing Heavenly Bloodline and Divine Power at once.<br>Naturally, the potential they wielded far surpassed that of their peers.<br>Furthermore, the fusion of the Netherworld Embryos would induce a qualitative evolution in the Netherworld Embryos. The Netherworld Sect had never encountered anyone who managed to pull this off.<br>According to the legend of the Netherworld Sect, if anyone who succeeded in the fusion of Netherworld Embryos was allowed to reach maturity, they would surely become one of the strongest experts in the vast world of cultivation.<br>Wu!<br>The four blood-red beams that were shooting out of Song Yun&rsquo;s eyes finally converged into two before eventually disappearing. The red marks on her body also gradually faded. Her body that was floating in mid-air slowly fell back down to the ground.<br>The Godwish Grandmother and<br>Lady of Dao Sea rushed forward to carry her, but the Netherworld Envoy simply waved her hand and pulled Song Yun over to his side.<br>He earnestly examined Song Yun, but the confused look on his face suggested that he was unable to find anything peculiar.<br>Chu Feng also took this opportunity to assess Song Yun.<br>Song Yun was currently unconscious, but her vitals had stabilized. It looked like she was already out of danger, and it was only a matter of time before she made a full recovery. Other than that, there was nothing peculiar about her.<br>&ldquo;Milord, based on what you see&hellip; did Yun&rsquo;er succeed in the fusion of Netherworld Embryos?&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother asked.<br>She was delighted to see that Song Yun&rsquo;s vitals had stabilized, but she was a little excited about the great latent potential mentioned by the Netherworld Envoy too. There were no parents in the world who wouldn&rsquo;t wish the best for their children, and the same applied to her too.<br>&ldquo;One of the traits of the fusion is the surfacing of the Netherworld Embryo&rsquo;s runes, as well as the convergence of the four blood-red eyes into two. This tallies with the earlier observation, but I&rsquo;m still not too certain about it. I&rsquo;ll have to bring Song Yun back to the Netherworld Sect with me to have the elders verify it,&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy said.<br>&ldquo;The Netherworld Sect? Milord, can I go as well?&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother asked.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, Godwish Grandmother. I&rsquo;ve been maintaining contact with you because I have high hopes for Song Yun. She would have lost her life if not for my interference. What&rsquo;s there to worry about her being with me? Besides, our Netherworld Sect doesn&rsquo;t infringe on the freedom of the members. Leave me with a location, and I&rsquo;ll bring Song Yun over to meet you in the near future.&rdquo;<br>The Netherworld Envoy&rsquo;s words made it clear that the Netherworld Sect would focus its efforts on grooming Song Yun, but he wouldn&rsquo;t allow the Godwish Grandmother to go together with them.<br>&ldquo;Milord, is it really impossible? I know that I&rsquo;m unqualified to enter the Netherworld Sect with my limited strength, but as long as I can be with Yun&rsquo;er&hellip; I&rsquo;ll do anything as long as I can enter the Netherworld Sect.&rdquo;<br>The Godwish Grandmother was saying that she was willing to humble herself as long as she could be with Song Yun.<br>However, the Netherworld Envoy shook his head and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the one who set the rules. I don&rsquo;t have the right to call the shot. If others oppose your presence, you might be in danger. Do you get what I&rsquo;m saying?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I understand&hellip; Milord, I&rsquo;ll be entrusting Yun&rsquo;er into your hands then. You also know that she&rsquo;s born with demonic nature in her body, so she&rsquo;s unlike normal children. If she ever offends anyone, I hope that you can take care of her,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother said.<br>She couldn&rsquo;t bear to part ways with Song Yun, but there was no other way around it. Furthermore, she thought that it might be a good thing if Song Yun could join a powerhouse like the Netherworld Sect. She could very well grow into an expert far surpassing everyone else in the Nine Souls Galaxy.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, the situation doesn&rsquo;t look good. It looks like Song Yun has caught the eye of the Netherworld Sect, and the fusion of Netherworld Embryos or something sounds like something formidable. Will she exact vengeance on your Hidden Dragon Martial Sect once she matures?<br>&ldquo;After all, your sectmaster nearly took Song Yun&rsquo;s life the other day,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng.<br>That was also what Chu Feng was worried about.<br>The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was indubitably powerful, but Chu Feng was uncertain whether it could match up to the Netherworld Sect. If Song Yun were to mobilize the Netherworld Sect to exact vengeance on the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, things could get awry.<br>&ldquo;Elder, there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d like to tell Song Yun. I know that Song Yun is unconscious and unable to talk, so could I leave her with a message in her mind instead?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the Godwish Grandmother.<br>&ldquo;Milord, this young friend over here is on good terms with Yun&rsquo;er. Would you allow him to leave a mental message for Yun&rsquo;er?&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother asked the Netherworld Envoy.<br>Even though she was Song Yun&rsquo;s mother, she knew that she couldn&rsquo;t call the shots for Song Yun anymore.<br>&ldquo;Of course. Feel free to do so.&rdquo;<br>The Netherworld Envoy walked over to the massive formation and retrieved a vat covered in formations. He formed a series of hand seals, and the massive formation began surging into the vat too.<br>It looked like he was planning on retracting the cage-like formation and quickly leaving this place with Song Yun.<br>&ldquo;I might have failed to capture that thing, but I&rsquo;d still be pretty lucky if Song Yun has truly succeed in the fusion of Netherworld Embryos,&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy murmured to himself.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng and the Godwish Grandmother left a mental message in Song Yun&rsquo;s head. Song Yun would be able to see those letters when she woke up, and due to the unique nature of mental messages, she would be certain that they were from Chu Feng and her mother.<br>Chu Feng had no idea what kind of letter the Godwish Grandmother had left for Song Yun, but the one that he had left behind was an apology to her for having failed to protect her. He then moved on to advise Song Yun not to make things hard for Zi Ling and the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster. He hoped that she could let bygones be bygones.<br>Soon, the massive formation shrouding the entire world had been kept inside the vat.<br>&ldquo;Milord, what is it that you wish to capture? I might be able to offer some help to you,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother stepped forward and asked.<br>In truth, she was just saying that in hopes of getting on closer terms with the Netherworld Envoy. After all, her beloved daughter was going to be taken away by the other party. Whether she would be able to see her daughter in the future would likely depend on the Netherworld Envoy&rsquo;s will.<br>&ldquo;Godwish Grandmother, I appreciate your goodwill, but do you think that you&rsquo;ll be able to capture something I&rsquo;m unable to. Don&rsquo;t worry, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Song Yun is worth much more than that,&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy replied with a smile.<br>Weng!<br>All of a sudden, the vat began to tremble intensely. Following that, the runes covering the vat began glowing brightly. Soon, it released a whiff of aura toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;The guidance of the Divine Vat! No wonder they say good things come in pairs!&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy exclaimed in delight.<br>However, Chu Feng and Shengguang Baimei knew that something bad was going to happen. Even though they couldn&rsquo;t see the Netherworld Envoy&rsquo;s face, they could sense his gaze. The eyes he was directing toward Chu Feng were filled with greed.<br></p></div>
