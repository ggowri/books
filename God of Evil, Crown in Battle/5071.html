        <div>: Why Are You Helping Me?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These three pills were around the size of a fingernail, and they were colored white, gray, and blue.<br>&ldquo;Master, is this the forbidden medicine you mentioned?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was able to tell right away that this was a particularly potent forbidden medicine.<br>&ldquo;What formidable forbidden medicine this is! These should be the ones Jiang Yuantai secretly used in the earlier duel. Junior Chu Feng, your master is truly knowledgeable.&rdquo;<br>The Lady of Dao Sea and the Godwish Grandmother began seeing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist in a different light. They were both proud people who didn&rsquo;t think much of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist at the start, only showing him respect in view that he was Chu Feng&rsquo;s master.<br>However, it was becoming clear that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was much more knowledgeable than them. The things that he said might appear to be nothing at first glance, but they were actually all secrets of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. The fact that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist knew of them showed that he was no ordinary world spiritist.<br>&ldquo;Elder, release the isolation barrier and allow me to speak with Sima Xiangtu. I&rsquo;ll head out and fight with Jiang Yuantai again,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s futile. He won&rsquo;t let us go even if you defeat him,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Master, I still wish to give it a try. Even if my chances are slim, this is the only hope we have,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t oblivious to the fact that Jiang Yuantai could renege on his promise, but there was no other way out here.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be better off finding a way to escape from here than to pick meaningless fights. We can all be saved if you&rsquo;re able to find a powerful helper. Otherwise, you should at least survive and exact vengeance for us in the future,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Helper? The only ones I can think of are the Holy Valley and the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect? Did you manage to enter the sect? But I haven&rsquo;t told you its location yet,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked in bewilderment.<br>&ldquo;Master, weren&rsquo;t you the one who got your friend to write a letter so as to inform me the location of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;My friend? Which friend?&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s the master of Zhang Yingxiong!&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Who is Zhang Yingxiong?&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist asked.<br>&ldquo;Master, you don&rsquo;t know them?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes widened as realization finally struck him.<br>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know them, and I have never gotten anyone to write a letter to you,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;This is weird. Are they helping me on their own accord? But why?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng fell into deep thoughts. He didn&rsquo;t think that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist would joke about something like this, which meant that Zhang Yingxiong&rsquo;s master had impersonated himself as the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s friend to relay the location of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect and the way to overcome the formation to him.<br>But why would they help a stranger like him?<br>&ldquo;It seems like someone has borrowed my name to help you get into the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist swiftly deduced what had happened.<br>&ldquo;That seems to be the case, but I don&rsquo;t know why they are helping me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll know the answer once we meet them in the future, but we&rsquo;ll have to first survive this ordeal. The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect wields great power. They might just be able to save us from this quandary if you&rsquo;re able to secure their help. The question is whether they&rsquo;ll be willing to help us,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter anyway since we&rsquo;re all trapped here. We won&rsquo;t even get a chance to ask them,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Who says that there isn&rsquo;t a chance? I don&rsquo;t know about others, but you should be able to escape from here,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Me? Master, are you serious about that?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was surprised to hear that. He had examined the confinement formation, and it was incredibly resilient as it utilized a treasure as its core.<br>The Lady of Dao Sea, the Godwish Grandmother, and the others also looked at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist in disbelief. They were also helpless toward the confinement formation, which was why the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s words sounded incredulous to them.<br>&ldquo;Dig my heart out and I&rsquo;ll show you a path. Follow the path into my soul, and you should be able to find a teleportation seal in there. Take it out,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Master, this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was reluctant to do such a thing to his master, but the Ox-nosed Old Daoist snapped at him.<br>&ldquo;Stop dawdling around and quickly get to it. Are you going to wait till all of us die before you&rsquo;re willing to make a move?&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist urged impatiently.<br>Upon hearing those words, Chu Feng stopped hesitating and immediately got to action. He dug out the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s heart and placed his hand on it. He couldn&rsquo;t feel anything at the start, but as the Ox-nosed Old Daoist started to channel his spirit power, he soon saw a path in front of him.<br>He followed the path and successfully entered the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s soul. There was a teleportation seal in there, so he grabbed it and headed out.<br>&ldquo;What a formidable teleportation seal this is. Is it crafted using a treasure?&rdquo;<br>The eyes of the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea lit up upon seeing the teleportation seal. They could tell that the teleportation seal harnessed great teleportation energy.<br>&ldquo;It looks like you have an eye for the good stuff. Indeed, this teleportation seal was made out of a treasure. I placed this teleportation seal inside me before confronting Sima Xiangtu just in case I got overpowered, but I underestimated him and ended up becoming his captive.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have escaped with the teleportation seal if I could, but this confinement formation around us prevents me from doing so. However, Chu Feng, it might just work for you since you&rsquo;re a junior and possess great willpower.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist turned to Wang Yuxian and Princess Xiaoxiao and continued on, &ldquo;Lasses, I know that I&rsquo;m being biased here, but to be frank, this teleportation seal is unlikely to work for the both of you. You&rsquo;ll need a sufficiently powerful mind to forcefully escape from this confinement formation, or else your mind might end up getting crushed even if your body is successfully teleported out of here. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m entrusting this opportunity to my disciple.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Elder, you don&rsquo;t need to explain to us,&rdquo; Wang Yuxian and Princess Xiaoxiao said.<br>Chu Feng began examining the teleportation seal in order to determine the feasibility of escaping from the confinement formation with it.<br>&ldquo;It does seem plausible, but what if Sima Xiangtu goes after you after I escape from the confinement formation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He was delighted to find a possible way out of this situation, but at the same time, he was worried that Sima Xiangtu might take it out on the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and the others upon realizing that he had escaped.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to bother about that. We&rsquo;re already in a bad position as it is. You can at least be assured that he won&rsquo;t kill us until he begins forging his pill. Remember, you should only return to save us if you&rsquo;re able to find powerful helpers. Otherwise, don&rsquo;t bother.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never too late for a man to exact vengeance. You can wait till your cultivation reaches greater height before avenging us. That would be much better than all of us getting wiped out. You should hurry up and go now before Sima Xiangtu notices anything,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you should go now. Listen to your master,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother urged as well.<br>&ldquo;Master, elders, and Lele, wait here for me. I&rsquo;ll definitely bring reinforcement in!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng bowed to the crowd before activating the teleportation seal. His surroundings warped, and he was brought directly into a teleportation passageway. When he finally exited through the other end of the teleportation formation, he was no longer in the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>It just so happened that there was an ancient teleportation formation located not just too far away from him. Without any hesitation, he took out a token and stepped into it.<br>It was the token that Duan Liufeng had given him before he left the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. No matter where he was, as long as he entered a teleportation formation with this token activated, he would be brought directly to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>The only ones who could save them now were the Holy Valley and the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>Shengguang Baimei and the others had already returned to the Holy Valley to request help. If the Holy Monarch was willing to intervene in this matter, they would head to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan on their own accord.<br>Thus, Chu Feng decided to head to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect instead!<br></p></div>
