        <h1>Chapter 4440</h1>
        <div>: A Tense Atmosphere<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shortly after the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother left, the surroundings suddenly fell eerily quiet. It was just like the intermittent calm before the storm.<br>Boom!<br>All of a sudden, the space in the surroundings shuddered, and a deafening sonic boom sounded. An incredibly powerful force was racing toward Chu Feng from the sky.<br>It was an invisible surge of energy, but the force exerted was enough to even tear through air itself.<br>This was the strength of a rank three Martial Exalted level cultivator, the prowess of the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Without speaking any unnecessary words, he made a move on Chu Feng straight away, aiming to claim his life.<br>Boom!<br>In the next moment, however, another equally powerful force burst forth and collided with the attack from the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, causing powerful shockwaves to ripple into the surroundings.<br>The sheer force jolted all of the juniors present in the area back.<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had made a move to protect Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, young friend Chu Feng is an esteemed guest of our Dragon Clan. You can always talk it out if you have any problems here. For you to make an attempt on his life just like that, don&rsquo;t you think that you&rsquo;re looking down on me far too much?&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said as he took a position in front of Chu Feng.<br>With these words, he had expressed the stance he had chosen to take. The Dragon Clan would be protecting Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, I advise you not to get involved in this matter.&rdquo;<br>Yet another voice sounded in the air. It came not from those from the Yu Heavenly Clan but the Supreme Elder of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect, Zhao Chunqiu.<br>Even though Zhao Chunqiu was just a Supreme Elder, his cultivation was at rank three Martial Exalted level, putting him on par with the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, and the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>As soon as he spoke up, the gaze of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief changed. He was starting to waver a little.<br>If the opponent was just the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, there was still no need for him to fear. The two of them had clashed with one another before, and they were equally matched.<br>However, if Zhao Chunqiu of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect were to join the fray too, he would have to face two opponents simultaneously. That would be extremely difficult for him to pull off.<br>Furthermore, while he knew of the means of the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, he knew next to nothing about what Zhao Chunqiu was capable of.<br>Judging from how Zhao Chunqiu didn&rsquo;t fear the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster at all, his prowess was definitely not one to be underestimated.<br>&ldquo;Is the Cloudsky Immortal Sect really going to get involved? I can understand the Yu Heavenly Clan wanting to make things difficult for young friend Chu Feng, but the Cloudsky Immortal Sect is clearly the one who wronged young friend Chu Feng in the first place. Aren&rsquo;t you afraid that your Cloudsky Immortal Sect will become a laughingstock if others were to learn of this matter?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother questioned them furiously.<br>She simply couldn&rsquo;t stand the shamelessly oppressive attitude that the Cloudsky Immortal Sect was putting on here.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo;<br>Inside the war chariot, Zhao Chunqiu&rsquo;s laughter sounded.<br>He didn&rsquo;t feel embarrassed to have such words spoken to him at all. Instead, he began laughing heartily in response.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all cultivators here. Don&rsquo;t you understand that the one with the strongest fist speaks the loudest? Regardless of whether Chu Feng was right or wrong, it&rsquo;s a fact that he has offended our Cloudsky Immortal Sect.<br>&ldquo;Anyone who dares to offend our Cloudsky Immortal Sect will have the pay the price of his action. I can tell you straight that we have no intention of letting him off today. What do you plan to do about it?&rdquo; Zhao Chunqiu replied haughtily.<br>As he spoke those words, his body also began floating out of the war chariot.<br>His figure wasn&rsquo;t shrouded in mist, so his appearance was clear for everyone to see.<br>He was an old man with snowy hair, but he had a masculine face. Beneath a pair of thick, white eyebrows were two small eyes, but his eyes were filled with ferocity.<br>He looked like an incredibly obstinate person who wouldn&rsquo;t step down once he had decided on something.<br>&ldquo;What airs the Cloudsky Immortal Sect is putting on! Let&rsquo;s have a taste of what you&rsquo;re capable of today then!&rdquo; a furious howl echoed thunderously across the air.<br>Following that, three towering silhouettes landed right next to the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>They were no other than the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster and the two prodigies, Bao Yue and Kui Wudi.<br>In the end, the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster still chose to side with Chu Feng.<br>Nevertheless, from the look in his eyes, one could see that he was doing it for his pride. If he were to compromise here, wouldn&rsquo;t it be equivalent to telling the world that he was afraid of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect?<br>For a powerhouse like the Monstrous Herd Temple, they couldn&rsquo;t afford to show any weakness before others, so there was no way he would be backing down here today.<br>As a result, four incredibly powerful oppressive might lingered in the air, creating a tense atmosphere.<br>Seeing how these four rank three Martial Exalted level cultivators were going to cross hands at any moment, Chu Feng felt a little conflicted within.<br>Without a doubt, the four of them were already the strongest cultivators in the Holy Light Galaxy with the exception of the Holy Light Clan.<br>However, Chu Feng could clearly remember that the cultivation of the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster was also at rank three Martial Exalted level too.<br>One must know that even though the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster was a reputable person in the Nine Souls Galaxy, he was definitely not ranked amongst the top. There were still far stronger experts like the Lady of Dao Sea who could curb him with ease.<br>Just from this itself, the huge disparity between the Nine Souls Galaxy and the Holy Light Galaxy became extremely apparent.<br>It was no wonder why other galaxies would look down on Holy Light Galaxy so much. In this world where the strong reigned mighty, it was inevitable that those who were weak would be looked down upon.<br>The reason why Chu Feng was thinking about all of this right now was not because he was looking down on the Holy Light Galaxy too. Instead, a spark of desire had suddenly ignited within him.<br>A thought had arisen in his mind.<br>He wanted to change the name of the Holy Light Galaxy into the Chu Galaxy.<br>Since the Holy Light Galaxy was unable to bring back the previous glory of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, he would just have to be the one to change it all!<br>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, loud laughter sounded in the air. It was from Supreme Elder Zhao Chunqiu.<br>In this tense moment, instead of making his move, he began laughing instead. This made the others a little confused as to what his intentions were.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster would be such sentimental people. You are willing to go so far for a junior. In view of that, our Cloudsky Immortal Sect can take a step back.<br>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take his life anymore, but in exchange, he has to kneel before the disciples of our Cloudsky Immortal Sect and apologize. As long as he&rsquo;s willing to do it, I&rsquo;ll let this matter go,&rdquo; Zhao Chunqiu said.<br>&ldquo;Since Supreme Elder Zhao Chunqiu has already said so, our Yu Heavenly Clan can back down on this matter as well. As long as Chu Feng returns the items he has received kneels down before us, and repents by slapping him a hundred times and severs his tongue, our Yu Heavenly Clan can choose not to pursue this matter too,&rdquo; the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>As soon as they said those words, Long Xiaoxiao felt rage gushing up her head. Her face turned completely red, and she gritted her teeth and roared, &ldquo;Why should he do it? He isn&rsquo;t at fault at all!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the first place, the ones who are wrong are your disciples,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother roared.<br>&ldquo;That madam over there, I must ask you to watch your words, or else I might misunderstand that you&rsquo;re snubbing me. We have already taken a step back, so isn&rsquo;t it right for you to do the same too? Or do you really intend to fight us?<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that you should have a clear idea of what is at stake over here. Personally, I don&rsquo;t really mind this at all. I am only a Supreme Elder of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect, so even if I were to lose against you, it&rsquo;s nothing much. A mere elder losing to a Clan Chief is nothing to be ashamed of.<br>&ldquo;However, if the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster were to lose to us, I&rsquo;m afraid that it might not look too good on them. I&rsquo;m sure you understand what would happen to the standing of the Dragon Clan and the Monstrous Herd Temple if such a thing were to happen, right?&rdquo; Zhao Chunqiu said.<br>Even though his words were very jarring, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster had no choice but to take his words seriously.<br>As the respective heads of their powers, how would they not understand the logic behind this?<br>It wasn&rsquo;t just a simple fight here anymore. It had already escalated to a tussle among the powers in the Holy Light Galaxy, and there were many considerations that they had to take into account here.<br>It was due to this that they were still talking to one another instead of directly coming to blows with one another.<br>At this point, Chu Feng also managed to get a good grasp of the situation too.<br>These four experts wanted to avoid clashing with one another if possible, and that was why they were negotiating with one another at the moment. Naturally, the chips to negotiate on this table was no other than Chu Feng, who was the origin of this conflict in the first place.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you should return the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s items back to them,&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief turned to Chu Feng and said.<br>After weighing the pros and cons, he felt that it would be better to sacrifice Chu Feng instead of taking on the risk of fighting the others.<br>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do, little benefactor. You can&rsquo;t return those items to them!&rdquo;<br>However, barely after the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke up, Long Xiaoxiao immediately interjected. She grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm tightly to stop him from apologizing or giving back the possessions.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao.&rdquo;<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief directed a sharp look at Long Xiaoxiao.<br>If there was a choice, he would want to protect Chu Feng as well. It was just that he wasn&rsquo;t willing to go against the Yu Heavenly Clan and the Cloudsky Immortal Sect for that.<br></p></div>
