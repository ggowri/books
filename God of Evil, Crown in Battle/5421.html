        <div><span>: If I Can Grasp You, I Can Curb You Too!</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>Chu Feng had already grasped the Dao of Absolute Darkness inside the black crystal.</span><br><span>Most powers could be used as soon as they had been grasped, but the Dao of Absolute Darkness was an exception. It had developed an individual will and refused to come under Chu Feng&rsquo;s command, even rebelling against him and causing a backlash.</span><br><span>If Chu Feng couldn't tame the Dao of Absolute Darkness, it would take over his body and rob him of his free will. In the worst-case scenario, he might even become a mindless demon who murdered everyone in sight!</span><br><span>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t lose his nerves. He knew that there had to be a way for him to curb the Dao of Absolute Darkness. He wouldn&rsquo;t have opted for the black crystal if he didn&rsquo;t have the confidence to do so.</span><br><span>Soon, the black aura seeped back into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, and he slowly opened his eyes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How is it, Chu Feng?&rdquo; Eggy asked concernedly.</span><br><span>She had been worried out of her mind, but she dared not to say a thing as she knew that it was a critical period for Chu Feng. Even now, she was still unsure about what had happened.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Eggy. I&rsquo;m fine. It&rsquo;s just that I underestimated the Dao of Absolute Darkness. It has its own free will and refuses to submit to me. Not only so, but it also wants to take over my body too,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the situation now then? Did you tame it?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I suppressed it for the time being. I&rsquo;d need an impetus to completely put it under my command. That explains why the remnant&rsquo;s owner said that she developed a secret art out of the Dao of Absolute Darkness. That might be the only way to control the Dao of Absolute Darkness, which possesses its own free will. However, it won&rsquo;t be easy to do so. While I have grasped its power, it&rsquo;ll still require a medium,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;A medium? What kind of medium does it need?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s seeking to take my body and use it for its own, but of course, there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;ll give my body away to it. I&rsquo;ll have to find another body for it before I can channel its powers. The problem is that its powers are too great for ordinary mediums to bear. I&rsquo;ll need something powerful,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Will it obey you if you find a medium for it?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be able to turn it into a secret art that way.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;What kind of secret art will it become?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;An extremely powerful one,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied excitedly.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How powerful will it be?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I dare not say that it&rsquo;ll be invincible, but it&rsquo;ll be a unique power that strikes fear in the </span><span>hearts of my enemies. You&rsquo;ll know it when the time comes.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Tsk. You&rsquo;re keeping me in suspense, huh?&rdquo; Eggy pouted. &ldquo;Is the Dao of Absolute Darkness harmless now?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course. I have already sealed it away. It might have its own consciousness, but it won&rsquo;t be able to do much inside my body. It did try to possess my body earlier, but I have already figured out a way to curb it while I was grasping it from the black crystal. In the first place, it was nothing but arrogance that led it to think that it could put up a fight against me! As a matter of fact, it quickly realized that it was no match for me moments after the fight began and surrendered,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied gleefully.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brat, aren&rsquo;t you being too arrogant? Do you think that I&rsquo;m afraid of you?&rdquo; an eerie voice suddenly echoed from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.</span><br><span>Eggy could hear it loud and clear too.</span><br><span>A flood of black aura poured out, enveloping not just Chu Feng&rsquo;s body but his soul too. It went without saying that the culprit was the Dao of Absolute Darkness, just that it was retaliating even more violently than before. It was acting out because Chu Feng&rsquo;s earlier words had angered it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng revealed a triumphant smile. He closed his eyes and quickly formed hand seals, but this time around, he formed cultivation seals instead.</span><br><span>Boom boom boom boom!</span><br><span>Dark clouds crackling with nine-colored lightning y gathered in the sky. This phenomenon was a sign of a cultivation breakthrough.</span><br><span>Soon, the nine-colored lightning bolted toward Chu Feng and assaulted him, seeking to erase him from the face of the world. Under normal circumstances, the nine-colored lightning would only affect Chu Feng alone, but the Dao of Absolute Darkness also suffered damage too.</span><br><span>The Dao of Absolute Darkness cried in misery and humbly seeped back into Chu Feng&rsquo;s soul, squeezing itself into an extremely small bundle of black aura. However, the nine-colored lightning chased the Dao of Absolute Darkness into Chu Feng&rsquo;s soul and continued striking it.</span><br><span>It was almost as if Chu Feng was the one controlling the nine-colored lightning.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Stop it! Stop it!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The arrogant Dao of Absolute Darkness immediately submitted, but Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t give it a rest just like that. He used the nine-colored lightning to construct a prison around the Dao of Absolute Darkness, trapping it in place.</span><br><span>Then, he finally opened his eyes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done, Eggy. There&rsquo;s no need to worry anymore. I have completely sealed it off,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you sure about that? You also said that earlier.&rdquo; Eggy was worried.</span><br><span>After all, the Dao of Absolute Darkness had whipped a backlash earlier right after Chu </span><span>Feng said that he had suppressed it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not lying this time around. I controlled the nine-colored lightning using the Dao of Specialization to seal it off,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Did you really make a breakthrough too?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I did. I&rsquo;m now at rank two Half-God level,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;But how did you make a breakthrough all of a sudden?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I felt an impetus for a breakthrough while suppressing the Dao of Absolute Darkness. In fact, the more it fought back, the greater the impetus became, but it caved in too quickly for me to make a breakthrough. That&rsquo;s why I said those words earlier to provoke it so that it&rsquo;ll come at me harder. That&rsquo;d give me enough time to make a breakthrough,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&hellip; You were making use of me?&rdquo; the Dao of Absolute Darkness screeched.</span><br><span>It didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng would intentionally provoke it just so that he could make a breakthrough, but the worst thing was that he actually succeeded! Its anger started to surge once more, and it looked like it was on the verge of a rampage.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oof!&rdquo; The Dao of Absolute Darkness suddenly cried in agony.</span><br><span>Even though the lightning phenomenon had vanished, the nine-colored lightning prison that Chu Feng had formed around the Dao of Absolute Darkness was still present. It perfectly curbed the Dao of Absolute Darkness, leaving it no room to retaliate at all.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brat, you&rsquo;re despicable!&rdquo; the Dao of Absolute Darkness roared.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Despicable?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether you possess a will or not, but you&rsquo;re mine now. I was the one who freed you from the black crystal and gave you life. You were born because of me. Just like how I have grasped you, I can also curb you.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You better think twice before going against me. I can turn you into my secret art and allow the world to witness your power, but similarly, I can simply erase you from the face of the world too.&rdquo;</span></p></div>
