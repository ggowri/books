        <div> - Top Quality Amongst Top Quality<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the crowd&rsquo;s curious and anxious gazes, Kong Tianhui first took a glance at Nangong Yifan.<br>Upon discovering that the insufferably arrogant Nangong Yifan, the person who had never once taken a glance at him before, was actually also looking at him impatiently, Kong Tianhui revealed a mischievous smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;How could you all possibly understand the encounter between myself, my brother Chu Feng and Miss Yin Zhuanghong? She was merely pretending not to know us. However, I know that we are actually very important people in her heart after what we&rsquo;ve gone through together,&rdquo; said Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;Pah! How shameless could you be?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;People like you think you&rsquo;re qualified to befriend Miss Yin Zhuanghong?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the crowd all cast gazes of contempt and anger at Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trust me? In that case, let me ask you, why didn&rsquo;t Miss Yin Zhuanghong listen to you, and instead decided to follow my brother Chu Feng without any hesitation, even after how much you tried to urge her against it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If they didn&rsquo;t possess extraordinary experiences and interactions together, would she trust him like that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should all also know what sort of character Miss Yin Zhuanghong is. She is very cautious, and would not easily trust other people,&rdquo; said Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing Kong Tianhui&rsquo;s words, the crowd felt what he said to be reasonable.<br>After all, they knew that Yin Zhuanghong was a very cautious person.<br>However, upon thinking that Yin Zhuanghong might have really experienced something with Chu Feng and Kong Tianhui, the gazes of the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s men all changed.<br>Even that insufferably arrogant and reticent Nangong Yifan had an ugly look on his face. His gaze had also changed. If one paid attention to it, one would notice that his gaze was very frightening.<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong had entered another world.<br>This was a palace hall. The palace hall was not very large. The sides were all sealed off, so there was a very limited amount of space for one to move around.<br>However, that palace hall was filled with blackiron weapons.<br>Swords, spears, blades, halberds, hatchets, battle-axes, hooks and forks, all kinds of weapons were present.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re deliberately concealing your cultivation, right? Rank two Exalted is not your actual cultivation,&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Yin Zhuanghong did not bother to pay attention to him. Instead, she began to earnestly inspect the weapons before her.<br>Chu Feng had met many cold women before. However, it was the first time he had met a woman as cold as Yin Zhuanghong.<br>If others were as frigid as ice, then she would be a frozen sea. She was truly someone who gave off a feeling of repelling others a thousand miles away.<br>Seeing that Yin Zhuanghong was earnestly making her selection, Chu Feng also began to earnestly make his selection. Unwittingly, ten hours passed.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the palace hall started to tremble slightly.<br>&ldquo;Is it warning us that the time limit is about to arrive?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Yin Zhuanghong examined her surroundings, and seemed to reach the same conclusion as Chu Feng.<br>She also felt that the time limit for the Divine Armament Cemetery was about to arrive, and that it was time to leave.<br>Because of that, she walked over to a black sword.<br>That black sword could be said to be the weapon that Yin Zhuanghong had observed the longest after arriving there. Furthermore, she had examined it repeatedly.<br>Chu Feng suspected that if Yin Zhuanghong was going to make her selection, she would most likely choose that sword.<br>Turned out, he guessed correctly.<br>However, at the moment when Yin Zhuanghong was prepared to grab that sword, Chu Feng suddenly spoke.<br>&ldquo;If I were you, I wouldn&rsquo;t choose that one.&rdquo;<br>Although Yin Zhuanghong had ignored Chu Feng&rsquo;s words before, she actually pulled back her already extended hand after hearing his comment.<br>&ldquo;Which one then?&rdquo; Yin Zhuanghong asked without looking at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That one,&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed to another black sword.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve determined that with those eyes?&rdquo; Yin Zhuanghong suddenly looked to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re capable of seeing my Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt surprised.<br>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s called &lsquo;Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an extraordinary ability,&rdquo; as Yin Zhuanghong spoke, she walked over to the sword Chu Feng had indicated.<br>Then, she directly extended her hand and grabbed the sword.<br>At the moment when Yin Zhuanghong grabbed the sword, she disappeared.<br>&ldquo;This girl, how come it seems like I cannot conceal anything from her?&rdquo;<br>Even though Yin Zhuanghong had already left, Chu Feng had an appalled look in his eyes.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes were very well-hidden. Even when he activated it, others would not be able to detect it. However, Yin Zhuanghong was able to detect it.<br>She was clearly not a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, yet she was able to see through the Saint-level spirit formation set up by Chu Feng, and even detected his activated Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>This caused Chu Feng to become increasingly curious about Yin Zhuanghong.<br>At that moment, the speed at which the ground trembled grew increasingly fast. Chu Feng was even able to sense the appearance of a power. If that power continued to strengthen, it would forcibly kick him out.<br>Chu Feng knew that he could not stay for long.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng extended his hand and grabbed a black blade.<br>When the blade entered his hand, Chu Feng felt his surroundings change.<br>When his surroundings returned to normal, he had arrived on a vast plaza.<br>That plaza was precisely the entrance to the Divine Armament Cemetery.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was able to see that the people that had entered the Divine Armament Cemetery seemed to all be present.<br>Furthermore, some of them were holding scrap iron, whereas others were holding Immortal Armaments.<br>It would appear that everyone had managed to gain a harvest. Merely, some people harvested treasures, whereas others harvested trash.<br>&ldquo;Woah! Brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve finally come out. Look! Even the skies darkened. Exactly what did you do in there with Miss Yin to take this long to come out? Brother Chu Feng, is your stamina this strong?&rdquo; Kong Tianhui immediately leapt over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side upon seeing him.<br>&ldquo;Trash over there, watch your words!&rdquo; The people from the All-heaven Starfield pointed at Kong Tianhui and snarled angrily.<br>&ldquo;Shut your mouth! Since when were you all qualified to gesticulate at my older brother?!&rdquo; Kong Ci shouted angrily.<br>Although that girl always talked bad about her older brother, she was actually a violent demon that was very protective of her older brother. Whilst she could criticize Kong Tianhui, she refused to allow others to criticize him.<br>Seeing Kong Ci like that, Chu Feng grew very curious as to exactly how much the people from Divine Body Royal City detested Kong Tianhui. Otherwise, how could they dare to oppose him like that; set themselves up to be his enemies, with a girl like Kong Ci protecting him?<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? What&rsquo;s wrong with what I said?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is there something wrong when I said that my brother and Miss Yin Zhuanghong took a long time to search for their weapons?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, I got it. You must be thinking something perverted. You are truly thinking of filthy things. You all are truly vile, truly vulgar and shameless.&rdquo; Kong Tianhui pointed at the person that had threatened him earlier and ridiculed him.<br>After being ridiculed by Kong Tianhui, that man&rsquo;s face turned red. WIth anger, he released his oppressive might. &ldquo;Shameless bastard, you&rsquo;re truly seeking a beating!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Try touching my older brother if you dare. See if I will cripple your cultivation or not.&rdquo;<br>Kong Ci stood before Kong Tianhui. Her long skirt fluttered about as her powerful aura surged forth.<br>She had released her rank two Exalted aura.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>As that man was only a rank one Exalted, his face turned ugly after being confronted with the rank two Exalted Kong Ci. In the end, he could only forcibly suppress the anger in his heart.<br>&ldquo;Miss Yin, quickly, have a look. Brother Nangong is truly lucky today. He actually managed to obtain an Incomplete Exalted Armament,&rdquo; someone pointed to Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;Miss Yin, this Incomplete Exalted Armament is my gift for you.&rdquo;<br>Nangong Yifan had arrived before Yin Zhuanghong. As he spoke, he handed the Incomplete Exalted Armament to her.<br>It was a dagger. The dagger was red, and very exquisite.<br>That red color matched Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s red dress perfectly. Furthermore, a phoenix was engraved on the dagger. Evidently, it was a very suitable weapon for a woman.<br>Thus, it was not only Nangong Yifan who felt that the dagger was a perfect match for Yin Zhuanghong; the others also felt the same.<br>At that moment, many people felt very envious of Yin Zhuanghong. Being able to obtain an Incomplete Exalted Armament in the Divine Armament Cemetery was enormous fortune. Furthermore, there were so many people that had entered the Divine Armament Cemetery, but Nangong Yifan was the only person to obtain an Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>Furthermore, the Incomplete Exalted Armament that he obtained matched Yin Zhuanghong greatly.<br>Most importantly, this was a coincidence, not something he had meticulously prepared.<br>This was truly fate and fortune.<br>Originally, the crowd had thought that Nangong Yifan would obtain Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s favor with that Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>To their surprise, Yin Zhuanghong did not even bother to glance at Nangong Yifan. Instead, her gaze was fixed on the blackiron sword in her hand.<br>However, Nangong Yifan was not discouraged. With a gentle tone, he asked, &ldquo;Miss Yin, this dagger is truly well-suited for you.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Yin Zhuanghong took a glance at the dagger. After seeing the dagger, she finally spoke. However, what she said caused the crowd&rsquo;s eyes to open wide, &ldquo;You should keep it.&rdquo;<br>Then, Yin Zhuanghong turned her gaze to the blackiron sword she held in her hand.<br>At that moment, although no one said anything, they all felt that Yin Zhuanghong was unable to tell what was good for herself.<br>Not only was Nangong Yifang eagerly attentive, but merely by that dagger, she should not be responding in such a manner.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Yin Zhuanghong flicked her wrist, and the layer of black iron covering the sword began to crack. Then, it began to drop off from the sword in pieces.<br>Soon, a red sword appeared in her hand.<br>&ldquo;That is?!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the gazes of everyone present changed. Not even Lord Shoujian was an exception.<br>The reason for that was because the sword in Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s hand was an Incomplete Exalted Armament!!!<br>Not only was it exquisite, but it also emitted a very powerful sword aura.<br>The quality of the sword was excellent, a rare sort of excellent.<br>It was far superior to Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s dagger.<br>&ldquo;Miss Yin, you&rsquo;re truly lucky. That sword is a top quality Incomplete Exalted Armament among top quality Incomplete Exalted Armaments. Likely, it&rsquo;s very difficult to find an Incomplete Exalted Armament of higher quality than that,&rdquo; said Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;Ah? It&rsquo;s actually a top quality Incomplete Exalted Armament among top quality Incomplete Exalted Armaments?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Miss Yin, your luck is simply superb. You actually managed to obtain such a treasure?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, even the geniuses present had envious expressions on their faces.<br>Incomplete Exalted Armaments were precious to begin with. As for excellent quality Incomplete Exalted Armaments, they were even rarer.<br>As for a top quality Incomplete Exalted Armament amongst top quality Incomplete Exalted Armaments, that was even more so the case!!!<br></p></div>
