        <h1>Chapter 3151</h1>
        <div> - Chu Feng's Involvement<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless. I&rsquo;ve already pleaded to them. However, they&rsquo;re refusing to give us face,&rdquo; Chu Hongyi said.<br>&ldquo;Are we to look on helplessly as they are tortured to a state of insanity?&rdquo; Someone asked.<br>&ldquo;What can I do about it? Are you suggesting that we fight them? With the strength that we have right now, it&rsquo;s simply impossible for us to contend against the Burnfield Monstrous Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I am to involve myself and save them now, the Burnfield Monstrous Clan will definitely come for revenge. At that time, it will not only be them who will end up suffering. Instead, even we will suffer a calamity,&rdquo; Chu Hongyi spoke with righteousness and conviction.<br>Hearing those words, the people that were urging him to save their clansmen lowered their heads.<br>Although they deeply wanted to save their clansmen, they did not want to be implicated.<br>Chu Hongyi sighed and said, &ldquo;If we must blame someone, we can only blame them for being unlucky.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Hongyi and the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen were doing nothing even though they were standing right across from them when they were clearly torturing their fellow clansmen, the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen looked to one another and revealed mocking smiles.<br>To them, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were simply a bunch of spineless cowards.<br>After all, the territory that they occupied was precisely seized from the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Stop!!!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a furious shout was heard. Following that, several figures appeared from out of the blue.<br>They were Chu Feng and the others.<br>The several clansmen that had guided Chu Feng and the others landed beside Chu Hongyi&rsquo;s group.<br>As for Chu Feng, Chu Ping, Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu and Chu Shuangshuang, they directly landed on the side of the Burnfield Monstrous Beast&rsquo;s territory.<br>After Chu Feng arrived, he immediately shattered all of the blades that were penetrating the bodies of the captured Chu Heavenly Clansmen. His powerful oppressive might even toppled over the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen present.<br>&ldquo;Impudent! You all&hellip; you all have not only intruded upon our clan&rsquo;s territory, but you dare to even attack us? Bastards of the Chu Heavenly Clan, have you all grown tired of living?!&rdquo; A member of the Burnfield Monstrous Clan got back up, pointed at Chu Feng and cursed loudly.<br>Even though he knew that Chu Feng was stronger than him, he still did not place Chu Feng in his eyes because of how much he looked down on the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after his words left his mouth, he fell to the ground once again. Furthermore, he had a very miserable fall this time around. Not only was he badly bruised and bloodied, but his arms were forcibly broken apart too.<br>&ldquo;You dare to attack people of our clan, the ones that have grown tired of living are you all!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, I, Chu Feng, will have you realize what the consequences of making an enemy of our Chu Heavenly Clan are!&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and the several Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen were forcibly brought into the sky.<br>Following that, Chu Feng pointed his finger at them.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, countless crimson swords appeared out of thin air. With rapid speed, they began to penetrate the bodies of the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen.<br>The powerful might of the swords not only pierced through their bodies, but also pierced through their armor, shattering it.<br>The previously arrogant and conceited Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen that were laughing and sneering at the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were now screaming miserably.<br>&ldquo;That&hellip; that Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Hongyi and the others also revealed astonished expressions.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had unleashed his aura completely. As such, they were able to feel what sort of cultivation Chu Feng possessed.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, he actually managed to make a breakthrough in cultivation again? Furthermore, he made two successive breakthroughs?&rdquo;<br>In fact, it was not only Chu Hongyi and the others that were astonished. Even Chu Qing, Chu Shuangshuang, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu, who all knew about Chu Feng, had surprised expressions on their faces.<br>They clearly remembered Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation to only be that of a rank six Heavenly Immortal when he entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura was now that of a rank eight Heavenly Immortal.<br>At that moment, Chu Qing and the others came to a sudden realization.<br>They finally realized what the abnormal sign that Chu Hongyi and the others saw was.<br>It was an abnormal sign brought forth by Chu Feng&rsquo;s breakthroughs in cultivation.<br>When thinking of how Chu Hongyi actually thought the abnormal sign brought forth by his fellow clansman&rsquo;s breakthrough in cultivation to be the sign of a cultivation resource, even Chu Shuangshuang felt it to be ridiculously laughable.<br>Although they were surprised by Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength, Chu Shuangshuang and the others did not just stand there and watch. Instead, after Chu Feng started handling the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen, they immediately set off to rescue their captured clansmen.<br>Those Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen were much weaker than the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen they had encountered previously. Thus, the method with which they tortured their prisoners was not as frightening.<br>At the very least, it was much inferior to the pain and torment brought upon them by Chu Feng.<br>Because of that, the rescued Chu Heavenly Clansmen were all still conscious.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had not only saved them, but was also getting justice for them by torturing those Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen, they all revealed grateful expressions.<br>In fact, it was not only the rescued Chu Heavenly Clansmen that were feeling grateful.<br>Even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that were standing on the sidelines watching all felt an indescribable emotion.<br>They truly did not expect that, at the time when their clansmen were faced with a calamity, the person that they deemed to be their leader, Chu Hongyi, would decide to do nothing to save them, and the person that they&rsquo;d pushed aside, Chu Feng, would be the one to uphold justice for them.<br>This gave them a complete change in impression toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, have you gone insane?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you know what you&rsquo;ve done?! You are harming all of our clansmen by doing that!&rdquo;<br>However, at that moment, Chu Hongyi pointed at Chu Feng and began to angrily shout at him.<br>&ldquo;What did you say? Me, gone insane?&rdquo; Chu Feng narrowed his brows and turned his eyes to Chu Hongyi upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;You attacked people from the Burnfield Monstrous Clan! They will definitely not leave this matter at that! You have implicated all of us!&rdquo; Chu Hongyi said whilst pointing at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Oh, so you were afraid of being implicated. That&rsquo;s why you looked on and did nothing while our clansmen were being tortured. Is that right?&rdquo; Chu Feng refuted.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Hongyi revealed a very ugly expression. He did not know how to respond.<br>The reason for that was because what Chu Feng had said was perfectly correct. He was indeed afraid of being implicated, and decided not to help his clansmen because of that.<br></p></div>
