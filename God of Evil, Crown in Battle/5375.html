        <div><span>: If Not For Your Younger Sister, You Would Have Been Dead Meat</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you must be a monster!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Ling Sheng&rsquo;er excitedly pounced around Chu Feng like a child discovering a treasure trove. It left Chu Feng wondering once more if this was truly the little demon king that Jie Yu spoke of.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young miss, he must be a monster!&rdquo; Yao Luo agreed with a bright smile as she stared intently at Chu Feng with glowing eyes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough of you two. You look like countryside bumpkins,&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er said with a chuckle.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big sister, have you ever seen anyone like Chu Feng? His talents are truly insane!&rdquo; Ling Sheng&rsquo;er exclaimed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng is indeed in a class of his own.&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er nodded in agreement.</span><br><span>Truth be told, Chu Feng felt profound satisfaction at being acknowledged by them, especially since he knew that they were the pride of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. It felt like he was proving the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion wrong for imprisoning his mother.</span><br><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion imprisoned Jie Ranqing because they thought that she had sullied their bloodline. That was a ridiculous claim, and he would prove it to them whether that was truly the case or not.</span><br><span>It was one thing for him to decide whether to forgive him or not, but if one thing was for sure, he would prove to them that they had done wrong.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ladies, I&rsquo;d think that you have fallen in love with me if you continue acting in such a manner,&rdquo; Chu Feng joked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hoh, you&rsquo;re pretty thick-skinned, Chu Feng. No matter how talented you are, there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;d fall in love with you that easily!&rdquo; Ling Sheng&rsquo;er clicked her tongue, though a smile continued to linger on her face. She knew that Chu Feng was just joking around, and she could tell that he wasn&rsquo;t the type of person who liked to be restrained.</span><br><span>However, Yao Luo&rsquo;s face turned red.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Waaa! Luo'er, your face is as red as a monkey&rsquo;s bum! Are you really in love with Chu Feng?&rdquo; Ling Sheng-er pointed at Yao Luo and burst into laughter.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m not! Young miss, don&rsquo;t spout nonsense!&rdquo; Yao Luo frantically covered her face with both hands.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You still dare to deny it!&rdquo; Ling Sheng&rsquo;er teased her with a mischievous smile. She knew that Yao Luo&rsquo;s face wouldn&rsquo;t redden for no reason.</span><br><span>&ldquo;All right, stop messing around. Young masters, you should proceed ahead first. I just recalled some matters that I need to discuss with Sheng&rsquo;er and Luo'er,&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll head on first then,&rdquo; Chu Feng said before entering the spirit formation gate leading to the next stage together with Bai Yunqing.</span><br><span>Just then, Ling Mo&rsquo;er recalled something and said, &ldquo;Speaking of which, young masters, even though we weren&rsquo;t able to clear this trial, our mother and Lord Jie Ranqing have cleared this stage.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Jie Ranqing? You&rsquo;re saying that Lord Jie Ranqing also entered through this entrance too?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What a coincidence.&rdquo; Chu Feng was overjoyed. He didn&rsquo;t think that he would really enter via the same entrance as his mother.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Back when Lord Jie Ranqing was young, she often explored this place. I ought to tell you that Lord Jie Ranqing has reached the highest floor of the Ancient Palace, and she&rsquo;s the only one in our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to have done so. Our mother was with her back then,&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Miss Mo&rsquo;er, is there a reason you suddenly mentioned this matter?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Through the experiences of Lord Jie Ranqing and my mother, we have an inkling about the stages ahead of us even though we haven&rsquo;t been through them yet. After crossing the spirit formation gate, you mustn&rsquo;t look at the writings on the wall, or else it&rsquo;ll shake your mind. It could cause you to go berserk and endanger your life,&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er instructed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Chu Feng narrowed his eyes upon hearing those words. Then, he nodded with a smile. &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</span><br><span>A moment later, he added, &ldquo;But if Lord Jie Ranqing reached the final floor through this entrance, why didn&rsquo;t Jie Zhou and the others challenge this entrance too?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Since the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was hoping for Jie Zhou to uncover the secrets in this Ancient Palace, it would make more sense for the latter to challenge this entrance, considering that Jie Ranqing had reached the highest floor here before.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s due to the details surrounding the prophecy.&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er elaborated more about Jie Zhou&rsquo;s prophecy.</span><br><span>It turned out that one of the conditions of the prophecy was for Jie Zhou to not tread on the same path that others have walked on. Since Jie Ranqing had reached the final floor through this entrance, Jie Zhou couldn&rsquo;t use this entrance anymore.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.</span><br><span>He shot a glance at Ling Sheng&rsquo;er before entering the spirit formation gate together with Bai Yunqing. The two of them were transported into a cavern.</span><br><span>There were two spirit formation gates inside the cavern. At the center of the cavern was a giant wall inscribed with complicated runes. As a world spiritist, Chu Feng could tell that a message was contained inside the runes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The runes on the wall sure are complicated. Most people would have closely examined those runes to decipher their meaning. What a cunning trap this is!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing exclaimed after taking a brief glance.</span><br><span>However, Chu Feng activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eye to carefully inspect the wall.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, didn&rsquo;t Miss Mo&rsquo;er tell us not to look at these writings?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked in bewilderment.</span><br><span>Chu Feng gestured for him not to speak before continuing to examine the wall. Moments later, he constructed a concealment formation to hide his and Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s presence.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you are&hellip;?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s face turned grim.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s head back together. You&rsquo;ll understand soon enough.&rdquo; Chu Feng began making his way back to the previous hall.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing could guess that Chu Feng must have sensed something fishy, so he quickly followed him. The two of them returned to the previous hall via one of the spirit </span><span>formation gates. Thanks to Chu Feng&rsquo;s superior concealment formation, not even Ling Mo&rsquo;er, despite being a Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, was able to notice them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do!&rdquo; Ling Sheng&rsquo;er roared angrily.</span><br><span>Yao Luo clutched her skirt tightly with a nervous look on her face, not daring to say anything.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Sheng&rsquo;er, I&rsquo;m doing this for your own good,&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is that why you lied to them, saying that they mustn&rsquo;t look at the wall? You were planning to make use of them from the very start to benefit us!&rdquo; Ling Sheng&rsquo;er glared at Ling Mo&rsquo;er.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ling Sheng&rsquo;er is a good girl. It looks like my judgment wasn&rsquo;t off,&rdquo; Eggy offered a rare compliment.</span><br><span>Chu Feng had chosen to ignore Ling Mo&rsquo;er&rsquo;s advice because he noticed that Ling Sheng&rsquo;er&rsquo;s expression had turned weird when the former told him not to look at the writings on the wall. Indeed, the wall wasn&rsquo;t a trap at all; on the contrary, it contained crucial hints about the next stage.</span><br><span>It was obvious what Ling Mo&rsquo;er was after. She didn&rsquo;t want Chu Feng to know the truth so that she could better make use of him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng was this talented. I accepted your request because we have been stuck on the same stage for far too long, so I thought that it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to give it a try. But he&rsquo;s far stronger than I expected. Perhaps, he might just be able to clear that stage too. This is a rare chance, Sheng&rsquo;er! We can&rsquo;t let this opportunity slip past our fingers!&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You know how dangerous that stage is! You should have told him about the dangers straight on and allowed him to decide on his own. How can you outright lie to him like that?&rdquo; Ling Sheng&rsquo;er bellowed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you think that he&rsquo;ll challenge that stage if I told him straight-on? Sheng&rsquo;er, you&rsquo;re the true hope of our Ling Clan, but the one who is recognized by the others is Ling Xiao. Think about how important the Immemorial Divine Water is, but it is being squandered by Ling Xiao. That should have belonged to you! You must quickly mature so that you can fight for the resources that rightfully belong to you. This is a rare chance for you to hasten your growth, so you have to grasp it no matter what it takes!&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er said.</span><br><span>Seeing that it was futile to lose her temper, Ling Sheng&rsquo;er tried to convince Ling Mo&rsquo;er by reasoning with her, &ldquo;Big sister, Chu Feng isn&rsquo;t someone without wits. Have you thought about how he would react if he learns about your ploy?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;What could possibly happen?&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er sneered. &ldquo;He might be talented, but he&rsquo;s ultimately just a junior, not to mention an outsider. What can he do even if he learns about the truth? We are the prodigies of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion! Who dares to touch us?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Since you know that he&rsquo;s talented, why don&rsquo;t you befriend him instead? There&rsquo;s no need to be so fixated on the immediate benefits,&rdquo; Ling Sheng&rsquo;er said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Sheng&rsquo;er, it&rsquo;s none of our business how powerful outsiders are. Only power that is grasped in our hands truly belongs to us,&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t allow it. I was the one who invited Chu Feng here. I am responsible for his safety. We don&rsquo;t need to do him in like that. We can just tell him the truth and allow him to choose on his own.&rdquo; Seeing that it was impossible to convince Ling Mo&rsquo;er, Ling Sheng&rsquo;er decided to proceed ahead and talk to Chu Feng on her own.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>The spirit power of a Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist burst forth and formed a cage around Ling Sheng&rsquo;er and Yao Luo.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What are you doing? Let me go!&rdquo; Ling Sheng&rsquo;er roared.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Sheng&rsquo;er, you&rsquo;re my younger sister. There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;ll harm you. Listen to me on this matter,&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er said before heading to the next spirit formation gate to look for Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing was infuriated, but he didn&rsquo;t speak a word. Instead, he looked at Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Chu Feng shot a glance at Bai Yunqing, and the two of them quickly headed back into the spirit formation gate before Ling Mo&rsquo;er and removed the concealment formation.</span><br><span>When Ling Mo&rsquo;er entered the cavern and saw that neither Chu Feng nor Bai Yunqing was looking at the writings on the wall, she heaved a sigh of relief and said, &ldquo;Young masters, I have kept you waiting.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Where are Sheng&rsquo;er and Miss Luo'er?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The two of them have matters to attend to, but they&rsquo;ll catch up with us very soon. Allow me to first inform you how we can clear this stage. We&rsquo;ll have to split ways from this point onward. I&rsquo;ll be counting on the two of you to clear the left spirit formation gate, whereas Sheng&rsquo;er, Luo'er, and I will challenge the right spirit formation gate. As long as we breach the formations inside both spirit formation gates, we&rsquo;ll be able to clear this stage,&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How difficult will this stage be? Will it be dangerous?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be difficult, but you can be assured that there won&rsquo;t be any threat to your life,&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er said. A second later, she added, &ldquo;However, you must give it your all. Don&rsquo;t let down your guard.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo; Chu Feng took out three jade bottles and passed one to Ling Mo&rsquo;er. &ldquo;Miss Mo&rsquo;er, this is a spirit medicine that can raise your spirit power. If you consume it now, it&rsquo;ll make it much easier to clear the stage later on.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er opened the jade bottle and warily examined its content.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Miss Mo&rsquo;er, you&rsquo;ll have to consume it right away after opening the bottle, or else its effectiveness will be halved.&rdquo; Chu Feng passed one of the bottles to Bai Yunqing, and the two of them downed the content in a single gulp.</span><br><span>Seeing that the three jade bottles share the same auras, Ling Mo&rsquo;er lowered her guard and swallowed the contents inside the jade bottle too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young masters, let&rsquo;s begin. All the best,&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er said.</span><br><span>But instead of entering the spirit formation gate, Chu Feng asked, &ldquo;Miss Mo&rsquo;er, have you heard of a saying?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;A saying?&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er had no idea what Chu Feng was getting at.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Those who seek to inflict harm on others will only harm themselves. It&rsquo;s best to be kind to others,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>Ling Mo&rsquo;er&rsquo;s pupils narrowed. &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, what do you mean by that?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Instead of answering that question, Chu Feng revealed a cold smile that sent shivers down Ling Mo&rsquo;er&rsquo;s spine. She immediately understood that her ploy had fallen through.</span><br><span>Without any hesitation, she released her spirit power to curb Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing, only to be horrified to realize that her own spirit power had been locked away.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You! You tricked me!!!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Ling Mo&rsquo;er knew right away that the medicine she had just consumed was spiked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I tricked you?&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed. &ldquo;Miss Mo&rsquo;er, we haven&rsquo;t been together for too long, so you may not know what kind of person I am. If not for your younger sister and the sliver of kindness you displayed earlier by telling us to take the stage seriously, you would be dead right now.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;You dare?!&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er was angered by the threat.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you think that I dare not?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered with murderous eyes.</span><br><span>Ling Mo&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face paled. She knew that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t just making an empty threat. He had the guts and skills to follow it through!</span><br></p></div>
