        <div> - Fusion Secret Skills<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re capable of, I&rsquo;m afraid you won&rsquo;t be able to defeat me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Li Anzhi.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Li Anzhi suddenly burst into laughter after hearing what Chu Feng said.<br>Many people were confused by his laughter. Clearly Li Anzhi was on the disadvantaged side during their first encounter. Thus, why was he still able to laugh?<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, that secret skill of yours is indeed extraordinary. However, your heaven-defying battle power originates from your secret skill and not you. You are only able to rely on that secret skill of yours to fight against me. If my guess is correct, that secret skill is your strongest technique.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for me, I have grasped many different Immortal Techniques. That rank three Immortal Technique is most definitely not the strongest Immortal Technique in my arsenal.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you really think that that secret skill of yours would be able to defeat me?&rdquo; Li Anzhi asked Chu Feng.<br>Once he said those words, many people of the younger generation felt what Li anzhi said to be very reasonable.<br>It was as he had said, Chu Feng&rsquo;s secret skill was extremely heaven-defying.<br>However, no matter how heaven-defying his secret skill might be, it was still only a technique of his. Right now, Chu Feng was only able to rely on his secret skill to contend against Li Anzhi.<br>Chu Feng had unleashed his trump card from the very start, whereas Li Anzhi had not. Looking at it this way, the situation was indeed very unfavorable for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Whether or not I will be able to defeat you, wouldn&rsquo;t you know once you give it a try?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, with a thought, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword standing before him suddenly turned into a ray of golden light and flew towards Li Anzhi.<br>Chu Feng actually initiated an attack at Li Anzhi.<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s incoming attack, Li Anzhi did not act carelessly. He pointed his Incomplete Immortal Armament at Chu Feng.<br>A golden ray shot out from Li Anzhi&rsquo;s Incomplete Immortal Armament. The next moment, that golden ray turned into an enormous hammer over a thousand meters in length. The enormous hammer collided with the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>Ear-piercing rumbles resonated as powerful energy ripples wreaked havoc through the air.<br>At that moment, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions grew tense.<br>The reason for that was because the enormous golden hammer had actually managed to beat back Chu Feng&rsquo;s Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword.<br>&ldquo;Rank four Immortal Technique, that&rsquo;s a rank four Immortal Technique!&rdquo; Someone cried out in alarm.<br>Actually, even without that person reminding the crowd, they were all able to tell that the Immortal Technique Li Anzhi used was a rank four Immortal Technique.<br>&ldquo;Clank, clank, clank~~~&rdquo;<br>At that moment, ringing sounds over ten thousand times more ear-piercing than bells sounded from the sky nonstop.<br>The ear-piercing sounds shook their surroundings violently. Even the martial cultivators present felt as if their ears were buzzing.<br>Li Anzhi&rsquo;s rank four Immortal Technique was repeatedly striking down at Chu Feng&rsquo;s Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and pushing toward Chu Feng nonstop.<br>Li Anzhi was very smart. He knew that the one that was fighting against him was not really Chu Feng, but rather Chu Feng&rsquo;s secret skill.<br>Chu Feng himself simply did not possess the ability to contend against him. As long as he continued to press on with his attacks and managed to land an attack on Chu Feng, Chu Feng would undoubtedly be defeated by him.<br>Unfortunately for Li Anzhi, Chu Feng was definitely not an ordinary opponent either. Chu Feng had already achieved mastery over his Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword. Moreover, Chu Feng possessed superb observation, and rapid reactions.<br>Thus, Li Anzhi&rsquo;s each and every attack was seen through by Chu Feng, and instantly blocked using the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword.<br>The giant sword and giant hammer collided in midair repeatedly. The confrontation between the two of them was what caused the nonstop ear-piercing rumbles.<br>That said, whilst the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword was able to block Li Anzhi&rsquo;s rank four Immortal Technique with difficulty, it was not as powerful as Li Anzhi&rsquo;s Immortal Technique. With every collision, it would be beaten back.<br>As the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword continued to be beaten back, Li Anzhi&rsquo;s rank four Immortal Technique began to grow closer and closer to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the outcome of the battle has been decided.&rdquo;<br>Seeing this, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations revealed smiles on their faces.<br>However, the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm that knew of Chu Feng&rsquo;s capabilities knew that Chu Feng possessed more than a single heaven-defying secret skill. They knew that he still had cards to play.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, as Li Anzhi&rsquo;s Immortal Technique grew ever closer to Chu Feng, with a thought, a golden, bright and dazzling war axe appeared.<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe did not possess heaven-defying battle power. However, after it appeared, it actually fused with the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword.<br>Its appearance strengthened the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, increasing its power to an even stronger level.<br>Meanwhile, Li Anzhi&rsquo;s rank four Immortal Technique had arrived again. As it collided with Chu Feng&rsquo;s Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, a loud and ear-piercing rumble was heard once more. However, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword was not beaten back this time around. Instead, it was Li Anzhi&rsquo;s enormous hammer that trembled violently before being knocked several thousand meters away.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What the hell is that?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s another secret skill? The two secret skills actually fused together and strengthened their power?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly how many secret skills does that Chu Feng possess?!&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng fusing an enormous axe with the enormous sword, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations all started frowning.<br>They knew very well that ordinary secret skills would not be able to fuse with one another. The only exception to this would be if the secret skills were originally one and had a natural ability to fuse with one another. However, secret skills like those were very difficult to come by to begin with, let alone two such powerful secret skills.<br>At that moment, regardless of whether or not they were willing to admit it, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were feeling restraining fear towards Chu Feng from the bottom of their hearts.<br>First there was the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. Then there was the heaven-defying secret skill. Chu Feng had managed to fight Li Anzhi with a cultivation of rank six Heavenly Immortal. This had already proved that Chu Feng possessed strength that could not be looked down upon. They were truly&hellip; afraid of Chu Feng.<br>That said, compared to the other Li Heavenly Clansmen, Li Anzhi&rsquo;s expression remained unchanged. With a wave of his Incomplete Immortal Armament, the enormous hammer disappeared. Then, he pointed his Incomplete Immortal Armament at Chu Feng, and a golden light immediately short forth.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a loud roar was heard.<br>The golden light turned into a golden rhinoceros. This rhinoceros was enormous. Its body was a thousand meters tall and three thousand meters long. The aura it emitted was many times more powerful than the enormous golden hammer from before.<br>Traveling through the air, the golden rhinoceros caused spatial tremors beneath its feet with every step. Even the earth was shaking. It was shockingly powerful.<br>It was a rank five Immortal Technique.<br>The rank five Immortal Technique rhinoceros collided with Chu Feng&rsquo;s fused Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe. An extremely loud explosion was heard.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s fused secret skills were actually beaten back a hundred meters from Chu Feng.<br>This rank five Immortal Technique was so powerful that not even Chu Feng&rsquo;s fused secret skills were capable of contending against it.<br>Seeing this, the crowd started to worry. This was especially true for the people that were hoping for Chu Feng to win. They were all feeling extremely nervous.<br>The might of that rank five Immortal Technique was simply too powerful.<br>Even though the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe did not shatter on impact, they were clearly no match for that golden rhinoceros.<br>Merely a single attack had pushed them back to Chu Feng. If the golden rhinoceros were to strike them again, even if Chu Feng managed to survive the attack, he would be seriously injured.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, another roar was heard. The golden rhinoceros rank five Immortal Technique had unleashed another attack.<br>Seeing the unstoppable attack from the golden rhinoceros, many people started to sweat cold sweat out of worry for Chu Feng. However, Chu Feng continued to have a confident smile on his face.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng flipped his wrist, and an Incomplete Immortal Armament appeared in his hand.<br>The crowd were confused by his action. Although an Incomplete Immortal Armament would be able to strengthen Chu Feng&rsquo;s control of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe, it should not be enough to withstand a rank five Immortal Technique.<br>At the moment when the crowd was confused, Chu Feng began to form hand seals with one hand. Then, he shouted lightly.<br>With his shout, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe started flying toward him.<br>As they were flying, the two secret skills also began to shrink.<br></p></div>
