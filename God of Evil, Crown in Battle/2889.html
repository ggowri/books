        <div> - Completion Of The Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Chu Feng stared at that spinning wheel. Soon, his line of sight actually turned fuzzy.<br>He was no longer able to clearly see the contents of that spinning wheel. As for deciphering the spinning wheel, it was simply out of the question.<br>However, Chu Feng did not panic in the slightest even with the situation being like this. Instead, he was secretly delighted.<br>Even though his vision had turned fuzzy, the sensation that his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes would soon make a breakthrough was growing more and more ample.<br>Chu Feng knew very well that his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes were about to make a breakthrough and enter a completely new realm.<br>While all of this was happening, Liangqiu Hongyue had already begun to set up her spirit formation. Her speed was very fast.<br>However, while she was setting up her spirit formation, Chu Feng continued to stand there. His gaze was fixed onto the spinning wheel the entire time. He stood there motionlessly, and did not even blink once.<br>Others would naturally not know that Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes were about to reach a breakthrough. Thus, to others, the only thing they noticed was that Liangqiu Hongyue had already begun to set up her spirit formation, whereas Chu Feng continued to stand there like a fool.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Why would that Chu Feng&rsquo;s deciphering time become slower?&rdquo;<br>The Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s disciples grew more and more worried.<br>As for the Nine Profound Sect&rsquo;s disciples, the sneers on their faces grew more and more intense.<br>Although Chu Feng had been defeated by Liangqiu Hongyue in succession, he was merely a bit slower than her.<br>However, Liangqiu Hongyue was now about to finish setting up her unsealing formation, whereas Chu Feng still had not done anything at all. This was not merely a bit slower. Rather, his speed was enormously slower.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Liangqiu Hongyue finished setting up her spirit formation, and activated it. A magnificent pillar of light assimilated into the spinning wheel. After that, the gate of the fifth Inheritance Site opened.<br>However, even though Liangqiu Hongyue had already unlocked the fifth Inheritance Site, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes were still focused on it motionlessly. He did not have any reaction at all.<br>Liangqiu Hongyue looked to Chu Feng again. Her attitude grew even more haughty. She was flaunting her victory.<br>However, Chu Feng did not even bother to look back at her. Just like that, he continued to stand there. This caused Liangqiu Hongyue to feel very displeased.<br>With an ill-intended tone, she said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, the outcome of the battle has been determined. Are you still planning to continue?&rdquo;<br>Even after Liangqiu Hongyue said those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze still didn&rsquo;t move. He still didn&rsquo;t look at her.<br>Instead, he raised his hand and signaled for Liangqiu Hongyue to quiet down.<br>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; Liangqiu Hongyue asked.<br>&ldquo;Quiet,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a very cold and slightly commanding tone.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s command, Liangqiu Hongyue immediately revealed a furious look.<br>She had defeated Chu Feng. It was one thing for Chu Feng to refuse to admit defeat. Yet, he actually dared to speak with her in such a tone. This caused her to feel extremely displeased.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on with Chu Feng? Could it be that he&rsquo;s been overly shocked?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To put on airs like this after being defeated, could it be that he&rsquo;s turned retarded?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the disciples from the Nine Profound Sect started to laugh mockingly.<br>However, regardless of what they said, Chu Feng did not pay attention to them at all. The reason for that was because Chu Feng was completely immersed in joy.<br>Overjoyed, Chu Feng said to Her Lady Queen, &ldquo;Eggy, I&rsquo;ve succeeded. My Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes have finally made a breakthrough!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Succeeded? Really?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen simply did not dare to believe it.<br>&ldquo;Really! When have I ever lied to you?&rdquo; Chu Feng was extremely certain.<br>&ldquo;This is great! In that case, do you think you will be able to surpass that girl&rsquo;s observation technique with your current Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;There shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Then why are you still hesitating? You should properly teach that girl the immensity of heaven and earth right away,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Milady,&rdquo; after saying those words, Chu Feng finally moved. He looked to Liangqiu Hongyue and said, &ldquo;Continue.&rdquo;<br>After he said that, he walked directly to the sixth Inheritance Site.<br>&ldquo;You?!!!&rdquo;<br>Liangqiu Hongyue bristled as Chu Feng walked past her. She was so furious that her body started trembling.<br>She was truly unable to understand how Chu Feng could act so arrogantly when he was clearly the loser.<br>&ldquo;This guy, he has clearly lost so miserably, how can he still act so arrogantly? He&rsquo;s acting as if he&rsquo;s the victor and not the loser. Could it be that he has truly been shocked retarded?&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng swagger his way to the sixth Inheritance Site, the Nine Profound Sect&rsquo;s disciples looked to one another in dismay.<br>The Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s disciples were also all puzzled.<br>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; Liangqiu Hongyue let out a cold snort. Then, she also walked over to the sixth Inheritance Site.<br>Chu Feng did not look at the spinning wheel. He was waiting for Liangqiu Hongyue. After Liangqiu Hongyue arrived, he asked, &ldquo;Can we begin now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sure, we&rsquo;ll begin,&rdquo; Liangqiu Hongyue spoke with an ill-intended tone.<br>The next moment, Liangqiu Hongyue and Chu Feng both looked toward the spinning wheel.<br>The state that Chu Feng and Liangqiu Hongyue were in at that moment was completely different.<br>Liangqiu Hongyue had clearly defeated Chu Feng four times in a row. Yet, she wasn't happy at all. On the contrary, she was extremely furious. Even though she was wearing a mask and the crowd was unable to see her face, they were able to imagine her enraged appearance.<br>However, Liangqiu Hongyue&rsquo;s anger was understandable.<br>Chu Feng had been defeated by Liangqiu Hongyue four times in a row. Yet, not only did he not have a disheartened look, he was instead filled with fighting spirit. He was acting as if he had been the victor.<br>If anyone else were in Liangqiu Hongyue&rsquo;s position, they would also be furious.<br>That being said, regardless of how exceptional Chu Feng&rsquo;s state might appear, no one felt optimism for Chu Feng. Even Xia Yun&rsquo;er was no longer hopeful.<br>Chu Feng had been defeated four consecutive times. Furthermore, his fourth defeat was such a miserable one. Who would possibly have hope in him now?<br>Unless&hellip; Chu Feng had deliberately allowed himself to be defeated earlier.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands started to move consecutively. He was forming hand seals.<br>Spirit power started to emerge from his body. Like a magnificent golden-bright and dazzling army following Chu Feng&rsquo;s every order, they started to form a spirit formation.<br>Chu Feng was setting up a spirit formation.<br>However, it had only been a short moment since the two of them started examining the sixth Inheritance Site&rsquo;s spinning wheel.<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng must&rsquo;ve gone insane. Even if he wants to win, he must first decipher the spinning wheel and find the method to unlock the Inheritance Site. How could he set up his unsealing formation so casually? Could it be that he&rsquo;s trying to rely on luck now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s actually been forced to such a state by miss Liangqiu. Truly lamentable.&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the crowd were all confused by Chu Feng&rsquo;s action, Asura Zhao Kun began mocking Chu Feng with contempt.<br>Once Asura Zhao Kun&rsquo;s words were spoken, the crowd all came to a sudden realization. They all felt as if they&rsquo;d been awakened by Asura Zhao Kun.<br>That&rsquo;s right, it was impossible for Chu Feng to be able to defeat Liangqiu Hongyue. For him to start setting up his spirit formation already, it could only mean one thing. That is, he was setting up a spirit formation at will, and relying on his luck. He wanted to see whether or not his random spirit formation might be one that would be able to unlock the sixth Inheritance Site.<br>However, the possibility of success of such a method was practically zero.<br>When thinking of this, the disciples from the Nine Profound Sect started to reveal an even greater expression of contempt and mockery.<br>Even the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s disciples started to sigh repeatedly.<br>In fact, even the elders outside the Inheritance Site started shaking their heads.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s unsealing formation turned into a beam of light and shot straight toward the spinning wheel.<br>His unsealing formation was different from Liangqiu Hongyue&rsquo;s.<br>Liangqiu Hongyue&rsquo;s unsealing formations always emitted beams of light from within them, but Chu Feng&rsquo;s unsealing formation itself had turned into a beam of light that assimilated with the spinning wheel. Thus, as his spirit formation entered the spinning wheel, his spirit formation disappeared.<br>However, after his spirit formation was assimilated into the spinning wheel, the Inheritance Site did not react at all.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip; truly making a disgrace of oneself.&rdquo;<br>Seeing this, the disciples from the Nine Profound Sect and Asura Zhao Kun all started laughing mockingly.<br>&ldquo;That youngster by the name of Chu Feng was too impatient. With how irritable of a temperament he has, even if he&rsquo;s extremely talented, he will not be able to attain greatness.&rdquo;<br>Outside the Inheritance Cave, the Nine Profound Sect&rsquo;s elders were also enumerating Chu Feng&rsquo;s shortcomings with a mocking tone.<br>&ldquo;Snap~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, a sharp sound was heard.<br>&ldquo;This!!!&rdquo;<br>The next moment, the people present, regardless of whether they were the members of the younger generation inside the Inheritance Cave or people of the older generation outside the Inheritance Cave, all revealed a massive change in expression.<br>Shock filled their faces. Not only were the younger generations inside all stunned, but the elders outside also opened their eyes wide with astonishment.<br>The reason for that was because the sixth Inheritance Site had opened!!!<br><br><br></p></div>
