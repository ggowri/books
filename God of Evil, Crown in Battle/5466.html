        <h1>Chapter 5466: Long Yuhong</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Beautiful sceneries flashed past Chu Feng and Long Muxi, but Long Muxi&rsquo;s eyes remained on the front, not slowing down at all. It looked like their destination was still a long distance away. Even so, Chu Feng quietly followed her without asking any questions.</span><br><span>He was still thinking about the protective formation inside his body. While he didn&rsquo;t get much time to take a proper look earlier, he currently had some thoughts in mind.</span><br><span>This resulted in a quiet journey between them. Perhaps finding the atmosphere awkward, the reticent Long Muxi spoke up.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you should have been to quite a few ancient remnants, right?&rdquo; Long Muxi asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, I have been to quite a few. Why do you suddenly ask that, Miss Muxi?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; Long Muxi replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha! Is she getting nervous trying to talk to you? Are you sure she hasn&rsquo;t fallen for you?&rdquo; Eggy asked with a chuckle.</span><br><span>Chu Feng noticed that Long Muxi was a little nervous too. She might be trying to alleviate the atmosphere as the silence was too uncomfortable for her, but she wasn&rsquo;t sure how to go about it, thus resulting in the earlier awkwardness.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Miss Muxi, are you bringing me to an ancient remnant within your Totem Dragon Clan?&rdquo; Chu Feng carried on the conversation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it.&rdquo; Long Muxi shook her head before adding, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s something similar. Do you know that there are much fewer ancient remnants now compared to the earlier years of our current era? There were ancient remnants all around back then, so it was all about who could grasp those fortuitous encounters first.</span><br><span>&ldquo;A huge reason our Totem Dragon Clan and the other overlords are able to retain our </span><span>dominant positions to this day is due to the accumulation of resources from back then. We keep the best treasures to ourselves and pass them down as family heirlooms.</span><br><span>&ldquo;However, the founder of our Totem Dragon Clan chose not to pass down all of the treasure our clan has obtained as family heirlooms. Instead, he placed some of the more interesting treasures into a dragon-shaped container known as the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted. Anyone who clears its test is entitled to one of its treasures, just that each person only gets one chance and the treasure received is completely up to one&rsquo;s luck.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Miss Muxi, are you bringing me to the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted to see if I can get anything good?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I got a decent treasure that served me well for a period of time while my cultivation was weaker. Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ll surely be able to clear the test, and you are much stronger than I was when I took that test. I&rsquo;m looking forward to what you can get from it,&rdquo; Long Muxi said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to it too,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span><br><span>Long Muxi brought Chu Feng to a place that was sealed off by a formation. That formation was constructed not too long ago, and there were many guards stationed around it. There were also many Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s juniors gathered in the area, and they seemed to be waiting for something to happen.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This is an important ground for the Totem Dragon Clan. Outsiders aren&rsquo;t allowed here,&rdquo; a guard bellowed loudly.</span><br><span>Without bothering to say a word, Long Muxi whipped out her token. All of the guards and Totem Dragon Clansmen quickly bowed deeply to her. It was evident from their fearful looks that she retained a high standing despite having left the Totem Dragon Clan for some time.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why did you lock off this place?&rdquo; Long Muxi asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Miss Muxi, something has happened to the Myriad Treasures Dragon Exalted,&rdquo; the leader of the guards replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Tell me the details,&rdquo; Long Muxi ordered.</span><br><span>Before the leader of the guards could answer, a sharp voice suddenly echoed from afar, &ldquo;Hoh! Who is this? Am I seeing things? Isn&rsquo;t this Long Muxi?&rdquo;</span><br><span>A group of people was heading over from afar. Standing at the forefront of the group was a mother and daughter pair who shared strikingly similar and beautiful facial features. The mother might have aged, but she had a refined and powerful disposition. The daughter was still in her youth, and her looks were on par with Long Muxi.</span><br><span>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t have a good impression of the daughter because she was the one who had spoken up earlier.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Paying respects to Lord Huayue and Miss Yuhong.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd&rsquo;s deference made it clear that the two of them were of high standing in the Totem Dragon Clan too. Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess was that the woman known as Miss Yuhong was Long Muxi&rsquo;s sister, probably from the same father but a different mother.</span><br><span>Long Muxi ignored the mother and daughter pair, but the two of them chose to approach her.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Long Muxi I thought that it was an empty rumor when I heard that you have returned. After all, how could the lofty Long Muxi who proudly declared that she would break away from the Totem Dragon Clan go back on her words? What&rsquo;s going on here? Are you struggling so much outside that you&rsquo;re coming back for protection?&rdquo; Long Yuhong walked up to Long Muxi and said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Long Yuhong, you seem to have recovered well from your broken arm?&rdquo; Long Muxi sneered.</span><br><span>A sharp glint flashed across Long Yuhong&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Long Muxi, I was going to let this matter go, but since you have mentioned it, I ought to clarify something here. You only defeated me back then because I was already injured, but you seem to think that you&rsquo;re stronger than me. Since you&rsquo;re back, why don&rsquo;t we fight once more to see who&rsquo;s the true weakling?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Yuhong&rsquo;s robe began to flutter as she released her oppressive might.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Rank four Half-God level? Miss Yuhong has reached rank four Half-God level?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd was taken aback.</span><br><span>A junior reaching rank four Half-God level was a big deal even for the Totem Dragon Clan. Long Yuhong smirked in glee. She had concealed her cultivation in order to produce such an effect.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Looks like the Totem Dragon Clan has its own internal conflicts too. Someone actually dares to provoke Long Muxi here! Long Yuhong must be either dumb or that she has something to fall back on,&rdquo; Eggy remarked.</span><br></p></div>
