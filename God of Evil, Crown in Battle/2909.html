        <div> - Running Into One&rsquo;s Enemy<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;This&hellip; why would it be this much more expensive? This is simply highway robbery!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, a hundred Immortal Martial Stones is a large sum to begin with. How could it be increased to five hundred Immortal Martial Stones?! That&rsquo;s five hundred Immortal Martial Stones we&rsquo;re talking about here! With five hundred Immortal Martial Stones, I would be able to purchase many Black Crystal Stones!&rdquo;<br>The crowd all revealed displeasure on their faces as they saw the change in the number on the signboard. At that moment, all sorts of protests could be heard.<br>&ldquo;Are young master Chu Feng and the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter not worth five hundred Immortal Martial Stones?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is up to you all as to whether you ascend to the second floor or not. However, no one can think about going up without five hundred Immortal Martial Stones,&rdquo; that Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s elder said.<br>This move from that Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s elder truly stopped a lot of people.<br>While one hundred Immortal Martial Stones was something they found reluctantly acceptable, five hundred Immortal Martial Stones was indeed something that surpassed the tolerance of many people.<br>That said, while the increased price of five hundred Immortal Martial Stones managed to stop a lot of people, there were still a portion of people who decided to pay the enormous sum. They were doing so for no other reason than to be able to see Chu Feng and Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>Seeing that there was still a large group of people following them up, Chu Feng said to Xia Yun&rsquo;er, &ldquo;Should we go to the third floor?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let it be. After all, with Elder Xingyi here, they will not dare to do anything. Furthermore, the third floor&rsquo;s Black Crystal Stones are simply too expensive. If we are merely having fun, there is no reason to go to the third floor; the ones on the second floor will be just right,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>It was as Xia Yun&rsquo;er said, the quality of the Black Crystal Stones on the second floor was indeed much better than those from the first floor.<br>However, they were also much more expensive. For example, of the nearby Black Crystal Stones, the smallest one was priced at five hundred Immortal Martial Stones.<br>As for the largest one, it was priced at three thousand Immortal Martial Stones.<br>With the Black Crystal Stones on the second floor already being so pricey, one could well imagine how expensive the Black Crystal Stones on the third floor were.<br>&ldquo;Elder Xingyi, junior sister Xia, the two of you have also come here?&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, an alarmed voice was heard. Turning toward the direction of the sound, they saw that several figures were currently walking toward Chu Feng and the others.<br>The person leading the group was the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Son, Song Yunfei.<br>Beside Song Yunfei was the Paradise Valley&rsquo;s Ren Xiaoyao.<br>Following behind Song Yunfei and Ren Xiaoyao were disciples from the Starfall Holy Land and Paradise Valley. Of course, there were also people of the younger generation that were not from the Starfall Holy Land and Paradise Valley. That said, judging from their outfits, they should be people from prestigious or noble families.<br>When Song Yunfei and Ren Xiaoyao saw Chu Feng, they revealed bitter hatred in their eyes. This was especially true when they saw Xia Yun&rsquo;er next to Chu Feng in a cute and helpless-looking manner. Seeing that, Song Yunfei was so furious that his eyeballs nearly fell out of his eye sockets.<br>Thus, Song Yunfei decided to completely ignore Chu Feng and not greet him at all.<br>&ldquo;Senior brother Song, I am here accompanying Young Master Chu Feng to participate in this Grand Auction Assembly. We just so happened to be bored, and decided to take a stroll in this Stone Gambling Hall. It&rsquo;s truly a coincidence to see you all here too,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er was as gentle and polite as before.<br>However, her words &lsquo;I am here accompanying Young Master Chu Feng,&rsquo; had most definitely pierced Song Yunfei&rsquo;s heart with pain.<br>Chu Feng was even able to feel intense killing intent from Song Yunfei&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;I truly never expected junior sister Xia to be interested in Stone Gambling too. Since that&rsquo;s the case, follow me. Senior brother will choose a couple Black Crystal Stones for you. I guarantee that you will not return empty-handed,&rdquo; Song Yunfei said.<br>&ldquo;Senior brother Song, there&rsquo;s no need for your trouble. Young Master Chu Feng and I will causally roam around and check things out,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er refused Song Yunfei&rsquo;s kind intentions without the slightest hesitation.<br>That&rsquo;s right, she had refused him. Furthermore, she had refused him very directly.<br>This could no longer be pulling hatred toward Chu Feng. Her action was simply deliberately angering Song Yunfei.<br>After all, they all knew what had happened between Chu Feng and Song Yunfei. Even if Xia Yun&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t do anything at all, Song Yunfei would definitely still make trouble for Chu Feng in the future.<br>Thus, Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s refusal was most definitely done on purpose. She was deliberately angering Song Yunfei, deliberately helping Chu Feng anger Song Yunfei.<br>&ldquo;Aiyoh, this is bad. That girl is actually angering someone from her own power for you. She couldn&rsquo;t possibly be interested in you, right?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said with a mischievous laugh.<br>&ldquo;Forget about it, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly handle a girl like her. Who knows what she&rsquo;s plotting?&rdquo;<br>Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s attitude toward Xia Yun&rsquo;er had improved by a lot, Chu Feng was still on guard against her.<br>After all, Chu Feng had suffered greatly because of her.<br>&ldquo;Junior sister, it&rsquo;s best that you not think that just because that Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques are somewhat decent that he would be an expert at Stone Gambling.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Black Crystal Stones are so special that world spirit techniques are simply unable to see through them,&rdquo; Song Yunfei said.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that senior Song is able to see through them?&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er asked.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t dare say that. However, the Black Crystal Stones are not without defects. It is actually possible to find signs. While I am unable to see through every single Black Crystal Stone, I have a seventy percent certainty of success,&rdquo; Song Yunfei said.<br>Right at that moment, Ren Xiaoyao said, &ldquo;Brother Song, you are being too modest. Only seventy percent certainty? The way I see it, you are simply completely certain.&rdquo;<br>Then, he turned to Xia Yun&rsquo;er and said to her, &ldquo;Miss Xia, you might not know about this. Brother Song is famous in the Stone Gambling Hall. He is known as Divine Eyes. He has been practically correct with his judgement in every single Black Crystal Stone. Never has he failed before. If you are to have him help you pick out Black Crystal Stones, you will definitely profit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er revealed a skeptical gaze.<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er had played with Stone Gambling before. However, her previous attempts had ended in disastrous losses.<br>That said, she had indeed heard rumors that there were people that were capable of determining the contents of Black Crystal Stones through special means without the use of world spirit techniques.<br>One such godly individual had appeared in the Stone Gambling Hall before. That individual was accurate in his every choice, and brought enormous losses to the Ghost Sect Hall.<br>In the end, the godly individual only left after the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master came and personally brought him great gifts.<br>Otherwise, if that godly individual were to remain in the Stone Gambling Hall, he would likely cut open all of the valuable Black Crystal Stones and bankrupt the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Stone Gambling Hall.<br>While Xia Yun&rsquo;er did not believe that Song Yunfei was as powerful as that godly individual, she was nevertheless curious as to whether or not Song Yunfei really possessed some sort of technique.<br>That said, Xia Yun&rsquo;er did not want to leave Chu Feng by himself. She knew the conflict between Chu Feng and Song Yunfei very well. Thus, it would be impossible for Chu Feng to accompany Song Yunfei too.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell that Xia Yun&rsquo;er was interested. He did not want to make things difficult for her. Thus, he said, &ldquo;Miss Xia, it would be fine for me to roam around by myself. You can go on ahead.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, Young Master Chu Feng, please wait a bit. I will return to find you at once,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said in an apologetic manner.<br>Hearing those words, envy once again emerged in Song Yunfei&rsquo;s eyes.<br>That was his own junior sister. In the eyes of the people of the world, the Holy Son and Holy Daughter were an ideal match to begin with.<br>Thus, how could Xia Yun&rsquo;er be stuck to an outsider? Furthermore, she was doing so right before his eyes.<br>Even though he was feeling extremely displeased, Song Yunfei did not reveal his displeasure. Instead, he said to Xia Yun&rsquo;er gently, &ldquo;Junior sister, please follow me.&rdquo;<br>Then, Song Yunfei lead Xia Yun&rsquo;er deep into the second floor. As for Chu Feng, he walked over in the opposite direction.<br><br><br></p></div>
