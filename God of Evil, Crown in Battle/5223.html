        <h1>Chapter 5223</h1>
        <div>: None Of You Are Getting Away<br>&ldquo;Y-you actually dare to hurt me! My husband is a guest elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect! There&rsquo;ll be no place for you in the Totem Galaxy now that you have offended me!&rdquo; the woman bellowed.<br>&ldquo;Are you trying to intimidate me with the Pill Dao Immortal Sect? Hah!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng swung his spirit formation sword down once more, severing the woman&rsquo;s other arm. This wasn&rsquo;t just a simple physical attack at all. What he was attacking here wasn&rsquo;t just her body but her soul too.<br>The woman hissed in pain.<br>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t going to answer my question, huh? Let&rsquo;s see how long you can maintain those tight lips of yours!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng took out a gourd from his Cosmos Sack and uncorked it.<br>Ah!<br>Yue Ling let out a shrill scream.<br>Countless blood-red worms had rushed out of the uncorked gourd, swiftly covering the ground. These worms resembled small centipedes, spanning a length of around thirty centimeters. They produced eerie &lsquo;<br>jip jip<br>&rsquo; sounds as they crawled around the ground.<br>&ldquo;What are you doing? Stop it! Make those worms stop!&rdquo;<br>The woman was aghast to see those worms crawling in her direction.<br>&ldquo;Why should I stop just because you tell me to? Who do you think you are to command me? Refuse to answer my question, hm? Let&rsquo;s see how long you can keep that spunk up,&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.<br>He was already being merciful here. If not to confirm the whereabouts of Yue Ling&rsquo;s father, he would have inflicted so much pain on the vicious woman that she wouldn&rsquo;t even have any room to speak at all.<br>Under his control, the worms perforated the woman&rsquo;s skin and wriggled their way into her flesh. The sheer number of worms entering her flesh caused her body to bloat up like a huge fleshy ball with things wriggling under the surface, making quite a terrifying sight.<br>The kind-hearted Yue Ling was nauseated by that sight, but she suppressed her fear and forced herself to watch on. Even as her body trembled, she held her gaze steady on that woman.<br>She wanted to witness the suffering of the culprit who had caused her mother&rsquo;s death.<br>&ldquo;Stop! I&rsquo;ll speak, I&rsquo;ll speak!&rdquo;<br>The woman finally succumbed amidst sobs.<br>&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; Chu Feng ordered.<br>&ldquo;My husband had to leave this realm to deal with some urgent business. My son is making use of this opportunity to frolic around.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could tell that the woman was telling the truth. She wasn&rsquo;t a sharp-witted person in the first place, and she wouldn&rsquo;t dare to lie after the terror she had just been put through.<br>Little did she know that her confession had only empowered Chu Feng to do whatever he wanted to.<br>Frankly speaking, he panicked a little when the woman claimed that Yue Ling&rsquo;s father was in the vicinity. It was already questionable whether his concealment formation would work against an opponent of that level, let alone confront the latter in a fight.<br>It was good news that Yue Ling&rsquo;s father was no longer in this realm.<br>&ldquo;Frolicking around? Your son sure is diligent,&rdquo; Chu Feng mocked.<br>&ldquo;Quick, get those worms out of me! I&rsquo;ve already told you what you want to know! I promise you that I won&rsquo;t tell my husband whatever you did today. I&rsquo;ll pretend that nothing happened at all!&rdquo; the woman pleaded in desperation.<br>&ldquo;I must look like a fool to you if you thought that I&rsquo;d believe your words. Do you really think that I&rsquo;d spare you after what you have done to Yue Ling and her mother? You&rsquo;re nothing more than the starting dish. Your son and your husband are next,&rdquo; Chu Feng scoffed.<br>He manifested a spirit formation dagger before turning to Yue Ling to ask, &ldquo;Yue Ling, do you dare to do it?&rdquo;<br>He was offering Yue Ling the chance to personally exact vengeance on the woman.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Yue Ling hesitantly bit on her lips.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. You can just watch by the side if you can&rsquo;t bring yourself to do it. I&rsquo;ll teach this vicious woman a lesson in your place.&rdquo;<br>He was planning to do to the woman what she had done to Yue Ling and disfigure her face with the dagger.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo;<br>Yue Ling mustered her courage and took the spirit formation dagger from Chu Feng. However, despite having made up her mind, her body was telling a different story. She was trembling so much that it was hard for her to even maintain her balance.<br>She was afraid.<br>&ldquo;Yue Ling, the world of cultivation is a place where the strong prey on the weak. I know that you&rsquo;re kind-hearted, but being kind to your enemies is nothing short of foolishness. That vicious woman is the reason your mother isn&rsquo;t with you right now. She even crippled the cultivation you have painstakingly trained up over many years.<br>&ldquo;To show kindness to a person like that&hellip; Don&rsquo;t you feel sorry for your mother? Don&rsquo;t you feel sorry for yourself?&rdquo; Chu Feng patted Yue Ling&rsquo;s shoulder as he spoke.<br>It looked as if he was encouraging Yue Ling, but he was secretly infusing spirit power into her to strengthen her trembling body.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you! I&rsquo;ll kill you!!!&rdquo;<br>Yue Ling&rsquo;s eyes reddened at the thought of her mother. She charged up to the woman with the dagger in her hand and began slicing at her face.<br>&ldquo;AH!!!&rdquo;<br>The woman shrieked in agony.<br>The dagger in Yue Ling&rsquo;s hand had been infused with Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power, allowing her to hurt the woman even when her cultivation had been crippled.<br>However, it wasn&rsquo;t long before Yue Ling ran to the side and started puking.<br>It was a traumatic experience for someone as kind-hearted as her to commit such an act of cruelty.<br>&ldquo;Yue Ling, this is something you&rsquo;ll eventually go through. Remember this feeling. If anyone bullies you in the future, you should return the favor like this,&rdquo; Chu Feng consoled her.<br>He had known that it would be a traumatic experience for the kind-hearted Yue Ling, but he still wanted her to personally carry out her vengeance because this was the only way she could vent her emotions.<br>&ldquo;That girl is too weak-hearted. Is she really a cultivator? Don&rsquo;t tell me that she has never killed anything before?&rdquo; Milady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;She probably has killed before, just never in a cruel manner,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let this Queen out. Watch how I torture that vicious woman,&rdquo; Milady Queen said.<br>While she didn&rsquo;t feel sympathetic toward Yue Ling, she did feel strong abhorrence toward that woman for her cruel deeds. Not to mention, this was a good opportunity to vent her bloodthirst.<br>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng thought that it was a good idea, knowing that Milady Queen was not the type to show mercy. Not to mention, she was more well-versed with a woman&rsquo;s vulnerabilities, which allowed her to inflict greater suffering upon that vicious woman.<br>Thus, he opened up his world spirit gate to let Milady Queen out.<br>Gah!<br>Moments later, the vicious woman was already screaming her lungs out. Milady Queen was using incredibly cruel methods to torture the woman.<br>Upon hearing the sounds, Yue Ling instinctively turned her head around to take a look, only to be dumbstruck by what she had seen.<br>Chu Feng hurriedly rushed forward to block her sight.<br>Milady Queen&rsquo;s means were simply so cruel that most cultivators wouldn&rsquo;t be able to watch it without barfing, let alone the kind-hearted Yue Ling. He thought that it might have been too much for Yue Ling to bear.<br>However, before he could say a thing, Yue Ling suddenly blurted out, &ldquo;That little sister&hellip; she&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was surprised.<br>He thought that Yue Ling was frightened by Milady Queen&rsquo;s means, but it turned out she was enchanted by the latter&rsquo;s beauty instead. Out of curiosity, he turned his head over to take a look. He had to admit that if he filtered out the ongoing torture and focused solely on Milady Queen&rsquo;s face, it was indeed an enchanting sight.<br>Even when Eggy was laughing sinisterly, she was still incredibly beautiful. This was probably one of the benefits of having good looks.<br>All of a sudden, Chu Feng sensed another person&rsquo;s presence.<br>With a wave of his sleeves, he constructed a soundproofing formation while closing the palace doors. Through the cracks of the door, he saw the young man whom he had previously encountered in the demon coffin walking over.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t alone. He had a scantily-dressed woman in each of his arms. Just as the woman had said, he had gone frolicking around in his father&rsquo;s absence.<br>&ldquo;H-he actually brought such women into our ancestral land?&rdquo;<br>Yue Ling gritted her teeth in anger.<br>Despite her father&rsquo;s actions, she still viewed herself as a member of the Yue Clan. She thought that bringing such women into their ancestral land was an insult to their ancestors.<br>&ldquo;Quieten down and listen to my arrangements, Yue Ling,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He brought Yue Ling, Eggy, and the woman to the corner of the palace to hide. At the same time, he contracted the soundproofing barrier around them while swiftly constructing another concealment formation to hide their presence.<br>Soon, the young man entered the palace with the two women.<br>&ldquo;Waa! Is this your ancestral land?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This hall looks weird. Why is it empty?&rdquo;<br>The two women remarked as they surveyed the surroundings. Clearly, the man had bragged about the ancestral land before bringing them over.<br>&ldquo;Gosh! Why is there blood on the ground?&rdquo; one of the women exclaimed.<br>It was the vicious woman&rsquo;s blood.<br>The young man shrugged it off with a smile and replied, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the blood of a useless woman. Don&rsquo;t pay it any heed.&rdquo;<br>He thought that the blood belonged to Yue Ling, though he quickly realized that something was amiss.<br>&ldquo;This is weird. Why hasn&rsquo;t the blood dried up yet?&rdquo; the young man murmured under his breath.<br>&ldquo;Have you ever considered the possibility that it might be your mother&rsquo;s blood?&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly spoke up.<br>At the same time, he dispelled the concealment and soundproofing formations.<br>&ldquo;Mother?!&rdquo;<br>The young man swiftly noticed the woman, but he couldn&rsquo;t tell if she was his mother or not after the gruesome torture she had been put through.<br>&ldquo;Hui&rsquo;er&hellip; run&hellip;&rdquo; the woman cried hoarsely despite having already lost her voice.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised that you still have maternal love in you. What a pity. Neither of you will be getting away today.&rdquo;<br></div>
