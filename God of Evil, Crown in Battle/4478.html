        <h1>Chapter 4477</h1>
        <div>: Amazing The Crowd<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What formidable martial skills! I would have never believed that one could actually master martial skills to such a level at their age!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;From the looks of it, it would appear that Zhao Batian is not a match for that lad. That lad is simply too frightening! Just who the hell is he?&rdquo;<br>Initially, it was only the top-notch experts who could tell that Chu Feng was in an advantageous situation here. However, as Chu Feng&rsquo;s blue lightning swiftly tore through Zhao Batian&rsquo;s purple flame, it soon became clear to everyone what the conclusion of the clash would be.<br>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a match for that lad despite having consumed a forbidden medicine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Looks like Zhao Batian doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance anymore.&rdquo;<br>Even the onlookers had proclaimed Zhao Batian&rsquo;s loss.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha, very well! I have been waiting for this day for a very long time! I can finally experience its true strength!&rdquo;<br>But to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, even as the purple flame he had unleashed toward Chu Feng was swiftly being whittled down, Zhao Batian abruptly burst into laughter.<br>Boom!<br>Zhao Batian&rsquo;s body began to swell up once more, growing by another twofold this time around.<br>His skin had begun cracking, and what that flowed out of these cracks were not fresh blood but a lava-like substance. An even more powerful surge of energy was gradually being emitted from Zhao Batian&rsquo;s body.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, are you insane?&rdquo; Zhao Yuzhuo hollered anxiously.<br>He immediately realized that Zhao Batian had done&mdash;the latter had just consumed an even more potent forbidden medicine!<br>Zhao Batian acted as if he had been possessed. He didn&rsquo;t even bother explaining himself, as if he couldn&rsquo;t hear Zhao Yuzhuo&rsquo;s words at all. His red eyes that looked as if they were spitting fire were fixated on Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I shall show you the true prowess of a Taboo Exalted Martial Skill!&rdquo;<br>As Zhao Batian spoke, a pair of massive eyes suddenly appeared in the midst of the purple flame, and a terrifying howl could vaguely be heard echoing from it. It looked so sinister that it felt almost as if a flame demon had descended upon the world.<br>At the same time, the prowess of the purple flame also grew exponentially. With its enhanced might, the purple flame finally managed to turn the table around.<br>With growing momentum, it began to claw its way through the blue lightning to strike Chu Feng down.<br>Chu Feng continued to release blue lightning from his body to fend against the purple flame, but he couldn&rsquo;t stop the terrifying purple flame that was swiftly getting closer toward him.<br>&ldquo;Is it possible to manifest life within a martial skill? What a scary power that is!&rdquo;<br>The crowd was shocked by the changes that had occurred to the martial skill.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha, do you think that&rsquo;s all? This is nothing but the appetizer!&rdquo; Zhao Batian laughed frenziedly, as if he had lost his mind to his newfound power.<br>Yet another two more pairs of eyes appeared amidst the purple flames, and the prowess of the purple flame grew by almost threefold.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; Isn&rsquo;t this a little too much? Just what kind of forbidden medicine did he eat to be able to draw forth such power from his martial skill?!&rdquo;<br>The spectating elders around remarked in astonishment.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unbecoming of a cultivator to be so reliant on such external means to defeat his opponent. I wonder how would that lad respond to this?&rdquo;<br>Faced with such a situation, even the experts who didn&rsquo;t know Chu Feng began worrying in his stead. They felt that it would be a huge pity for Chu Feng to lose his life here.<br>In a real battle, Zhao Batian wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance against Chu Feng. In terms of character, Chu Feng seemed to be much more of a decent human being as compared to Zhao Batian.<br>Putting aside the cause of the battle, even after Chu Feng had defeated Zhao Batian and chosen to let him off, Zhao Batian still shamelessly tried to sneak a surprise assault on Chu Feng. After his surprise assault had been foiled, he resorted to consuming forbidden medicine to stand his ground.<br>If there was anyone who deserved to die here, the crowd would unhesitatingly point their fingers at Zhao Batian.<br>And given that even the onlookers were so worried about Chu Feng, there was no need to say just how the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster, and the others were feeling at the moment.<br>It was not that they didn&rsquo;t believe in Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength, but Zhao Batian was simply too terrifying after consuming two forbidden medicines. His prowess already far surpassed that of ordinary rank eight Utmost Exalted level cultivators.<br>Unless Chu Feng had another trump card prepared, it would be hard for him to triumph over Zhao Batian.<br>But did Chu Feng really still have anything else up his sleeves?<br>They honestly didn&rsquo;t know, and they weren&rsquo;t willing to bet on the possibility. If they continued to stand around and do nothing at all, Chu Feng could very well lose his life!<br>But before any of them could make a move, Chu Feng suddenly spoke up, &ldquo;Is that all you have?&rdquo;<br>Those who had just prepared themselves to make a move calmed down once more.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s tone was calm and confident. It didn&rsquo;t seem like he was panicking despite the overwhelming might of Zhao Batian&rsquo;s martial skill.<br>In fact, rather than saying that he was not panicking, it seemed like he was mocking Zhao Batian even.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean by this?&rdquo; Zhao Batian was a little taken aback to hear Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re done, it should be my turn to make a move.&rdquo;<br>Tzlala!<br>Right after saying those words, six surges of lightning burst forth from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body and swiftly morphed into the silhouette of a human.<br>&ldquo;Those are&hellip; Lightning Souls?&rdquo;<br>The crowd from the Yu Heavenly Clan dilated their pupils in stupefaction. Even the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief could hardly conceal his disbelief at this situation.<br>&ldquo;I knew that he had left a hand, but I didn&rsquo;t think that he would still have something so powerful up his sleeves. He could actually manifest six Lightning Souls simultaneously?!&rdquo;<br>Yu Lie looked utterly dumbstruck.<br>One must know that he had to push himself beyond his limit in order to manifest a second Lightning Soul, but at this very instant, Chu Feng was manifesting six Lightning Souls at once with a leisurely look at his face.<br>This further drove in the disparity in talent between him and Chu Feng, and a feeling of helplessness rose within him.<br>&ldquo;How could a junior manifest six Lightning Souls? Just how in the world is Chu Feng doing this? Is it really possible for a person so talented to exist in the world?&rdquo;<br>The Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief looked at Chu Feng with a look of lamentation in his eyes. With a deep sigh, he murmured regretfully, &ldquo;Why is such a prodigy not from our clan?&rdquo;<br>Tzlala!<br>While everyone was still in a state of shock, the six Lightning Souls began to expand rapidly as they launched their attacks toward Zhao Batian.<br>Boom boom!<br>The overpowering might of the Lightning Souls tore through the frightening purple flame without any resistance to strike down on Zhao Batian, smashing him right into the ground.<br>The sheer force had incapacitated Zhao Batian, but he wasn&rsquo;t dead yet. There was still a breath of life in him.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t kill him right away!<br>Pah!<br>A leg pressed down on Zhao Batian&rsquo;s chest as a sword was placed right before his face.<br>It was Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Like I have said, you won&rsquo;t be getting out of here alive,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Stop! If you dare to kill my big brother, I&rsquo;ll massacre your entire clan!&rdquo; a furious howl suddenly sounded at this moment&mdash;Zhao Yuzhuo.<br>Zhao Yuzhuo was anxious for his Zhao Batian&rsquo;s safety, but despite so, his attitude still remained overbearing. He was utterly confident in himself.<br>But Chu Feng simply sneered coldly in response to Zhao Yuzhuo&rsquo;s threat.<br>Puchi.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword pierced right through Zhao Batian&rsquo;s head.<br></p></div>
