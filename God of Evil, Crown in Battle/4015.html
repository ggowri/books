        <div> - To Extort A Confession By Torture<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Zhao Hong and Han Xiu had been immobilized by the attractive power and forcibly pulled into the crowd&rsquo;s field of view from the distant sky.<br>They appeared very miserable.<br>That said, looking miserable was not all it was.<br>Compared to when she'd left earlier, Zhao Hong&rsquo;s health had grown even weaker. Her face was covered in blood. Blood was also frantically pouring from her eyes, mouth, ears and nose uncontrollably.<br>On top of that, she was violently panting and coughing. It was like she was dying.<br>Compared to her, Han Xiu only looked very miserable, and had not changed too much. Her injuries were not too serious.<br>This meant that Zhao Hong&rsquo;s injury was not caused by the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted forcibly capturing them. Rather, it had been caused by something else.<br>Connecting her state with what had happened earlier, the crowd realized that the overwhelming crimson sword from earlier must have been Zhao Hong&rsquo;s ability.<br>Zhao Hong had pretended to leave earlier and had hidden herself to gather her power to mount a sneak attack.<br>It must be said that Zhao Hong&rsquo;s attack had been truly quite powerful.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, even the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster would have found it very difficult to handle.<br>Unfortunately, no one had anticipated that the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted would be so powerful.<br>He had easily defeated Zhao Hong&rsquo;s attack.<br>Not only that, but he had also easily captured the hidden Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;Zhao Hong, so what if you were a renowned genius of the All-heaven Starfield?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today is different from then. Since you dared to attack this Exalted, this Exalted will have you realize what the consequences of your actions are.&rdquo;<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted looked at the miserable Zhao Hong without any trace of pity in his eyes. Instead, his gaze had become fierce and malicious.<br>He clenched his hand, and a crimson rod appeared.<br>The two sides of the crimson rod were extremely sharp.<br>With a &lsquo;puchi,&rsquo; the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s crimson rod pierced into Zhao Hong&rsquo;s neck.<br>After the crimson rod penetrated Zhao Hong&rsquo;s neck, it began to transform.<br>The crimson rod turned pitch-black. It turned out that the crimson color was a special type of power.<br>As the rod penetrated Zhao Hong&rsquo;s body, that special power also entered into Zhao Hong's body.<br>Zhao Hong was in extreme pain. Even though she was a very unyielding person and had stood back up, she immediately fell onto one knee again from the pain, with her hands holding her neck and her face distorted from pain.<br>&ldquo;Milady!&rdquo;<br>Han Xiu wanted to rush over the moment she saw that.<br>However, another crimson ray flashed, and Han Xiu also found her body pierced through by the crimson rod.<br>That crimson rod actually penetrated Han Xiu&rsquo;s head.<br>With that, Han Xiu was unable to speak. As if she had lost consciousness, she became motionless.<br>However, her eyes were still open.<br>Everyone could tell that she was still alive, and had merely lost consciousness. She was simply in too much pain that she could not even utter a sound.<br>Seeing the miserable torment Zhao Hong and Han Xiu were receiving, Chu Feng was immediately enraged.<br>&ldquo;Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, I will dismember you into ten thousand pieces!&rdquo; Chu Feng roared furiously with so much anger that his facial veins were bulging.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after Chu Feng&rsquo;s words left his mouth, he let out a muffled sound.<br>The crowd looked over, and their expressions all changed.<br>It turned out that the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had arrived before Chu Feng.<br>The Wind Lightning Sword he held in his hand had pierced Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Dismember into ten thousand pieces?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, if you do not hand over the treasures, I will have you realize what it means to be in so much misery that you'll wish to be dead.&rdquo;<br>The Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster stared at Chu Feng ferociously. It just so happened that he also had a refreshed look on his face.<br>Due to the various things that had happened before, he already had a bone-deep hatred for Chu Feng. Now that the opportunity to take care of him had finally appeared, he would naturally feel incomparably refreshed.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best kill me today. Otherwise&hellip; I will definitely take your lousy life.&rdquo;<br>Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s complexion was deathly pale and he appeared to be in extremely weak health, his gaze was extremely vicious.<br>He was not joking around.<br>Chu Feng had gone there only for the All-heaven Sect.<br>He had given the five great powers sufficient face and respect.<br>Yet, even in such a situation, the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster had insisted on making things difficult for him.<br>Not only had they attacked him, they'd also attacked his friends.<br>They were using his friends&rsquo; lives to threaten him. They were blackmailing him with the torture of his friends.<br>Chu Feng had taken note of it all, and remembered everything deep in his heart.<br>If he didn&rsquo;t die, he would definitely have them pay with their lives.<br>&ldquo;Perhaps you still don&rsquo;t understand what it means to be powerless to defend oneself.&rdquo;<br>Another voice sounded. It was the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>He'd arrived beside the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster and opened his palm. In his hand was a transparent jade bowl. Inside that jade bowl were three bugs.<br>Those three bugs all looked the same. They were all pitch-black, and appeared to be made of black steel.<br>However, they were alive. They were living bugs.<br>Those three bugs were all emitting different sorts of powers.<br>One bug was burning with flames.<br>Another bug was emitting cold air.<br>As for the last bug, its body was emitting poisonous gas.<br>&ldquo;Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the three bugs, someone amongst the crowd let out a cry of alarm.<br>That voice contained fear more than anything else.<br>Those bugs were actually very renowned.<br>This was especially true for the people that knew the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain, they all knew of the Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs.<br>They were a sort of poisonous bug that had originated from the Ancient Era. The Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain had used the blood of ferocious beasts and special methods to raise them into very terrifying bugs.<br>Those bugs were capable of entering one&rsquo;s body and harming one&rsquo;s soul whilst bringing about unimaginable pain and suffering.<br>If it were only a single poisonous bug, it would not be deadly. However, none of the people that had been tormented by the poisonous bugs were able to spend the rest of their lives in peace.<br>For the majority of people, once they suffered the torture of the poisonous bugs, their appearances would not only become ugly, but they would also grow mad, no longer able to return to normal.<br>No matter who it was that attempted to treat them, no matter how strong the treatment might be, they were all useless.<br>The reason for that was because what the poisonous bugs harmed were one&rsquo;s soul.<br>Those bugs were the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s favorite things to use to extort confessions.<br>Due to their renowned and vicious reputations, some people would immediately confess the moment they saw them.<br>&ldquo;Since he&rsquo;s so tight-lipped, let&rsquo;s use these to make him talk,&rdquo; the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster said to the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; nodded the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster. Then, he pulled his Wind Lightning Sword out of Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>The Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster placed the bugs into the wound created by Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>Once the bugs entered his body, Chu Feng immediately started screaming miserably.<br>His body was occasionally burning with raging flames, occasionally emitting chilling frost, and occasionally sending out poisonous gas.<br>Chu Feng was being tortured beyond recognition. His appearance at that moment was a heaven and earth difference from before.<br>When others were tortured, they would always become weaker and weaker. Their ear-piercing shouts at the beginning would gradually grow weaker and softer.<br>However, Chu Feng was different. His screams became louder and louder. They were even more ear-piercing than thunder, even more resounding than the roars of ferocious beasts.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that his voice was miserable, he would simply sound like he was shouting.<br>However, the people that knew about those bugs knew that his reaction was normal. They knew that it was caused by a sort of poison from the Nine Stars Corpse-devouring Bugs.<br>Under the effect of that poison, whilst the poisoned individual would suffer enormous pain, their bodies would not grow weaker. Rather, they would become particularly excited under the pain, and their bodies would become particularly robust.<br>The reason for such an abnormal phenomenon was because the poison was overdrafting the power of one&rsquo;s soul.<br>It was all so that the poisoned individual would have the physical strength to endure the fierce torture of the poison and not lose consciousness in the process. It was so that the poisoned individual could endure the torture and pain whilst conscious, right up until the point at which they suffered a nervous breakdown.<br></p></div>
