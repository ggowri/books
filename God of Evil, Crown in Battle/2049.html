        <div> - Exceptional Treasure<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Everyone, I am truly sorry. I was incompetent, and ended up being exploited by the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master,&rdquo; After everyone was gathered, the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief used a very resounding voice to explain to the crowd how the people from the Dark Hall had exploited them, and what had happened in the process.<br>Due to the fact that the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief&rsquo;s voice was extremely resounding, not only did all of the Icesnow Phoenixes hear it, even the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; allied army outside the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; territory heard it.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, it&rsquo;s little friend Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>After the Icesnow Phoenixes learned the truth, they were extremely furious. However, as for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, they were not only furious. At the same time, they were also feeling great admiration.<br>Of course, they were not admiring the Icesnow Phoenixes, nor were they admiring the Dark Hall. Rather, they were admiring Chu Feng.<br>As matters stood, they were absolutely certain that such a dramatic change had happened because of Chu Feng.<br>It would be one thing if it was in the past. However, Chu Feng had actually managed to convert enemies into friends at such a crucial time. As such, the significance of his actions was completely different.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected that little friend Chu Feng not only possesses a lot of friends, his friends are all extraordinary people too,&rdquo; At that moment, Zhang Ming spoke with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others also nodded to express their approval. Like Zhang Ming, they also had beaming smiles on their faces.<br>First it was Du Wanwu, a frightening existence that nearly brought about the complete annihilation of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; army. Yet&hellip; he was Chu Feng&rsquo;s friend.<br>And now, another of Chu Feng&rsquo;s friends had appeared. This friend of his seemed even more exceptional. This friend was actually the Chieftain of the strongest and most mysterious monstrous beasts in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>To have this many friends, and for his friends to be this exceptional, the crowd all felt endless admiration for Chu Feng. [1. Xima: &hellip; that&rsquo;s only 2 friends you talked about Bee, if you needed to add more filler, why not just talk about all of the &lsquo;friends&rsquo; who are the inheritors?  YWL: technically, the other friends are also exceptional. Bee didn&rsquo;t directly list which friends the crowd were thinking about. They might be thinking about Chu Feng&rsquo;s other friends&hellip; like Wang Qiang.]<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>After he finished his announcement, the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief began to organize the army of Icesnow Phoenixes. He was determined to join hands with the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves to eradicate the Dark Hall for taking advantage of them.<br>After the troops were organized, the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief arrived at the castle that Tantai Xue lived in.<br>After he entered Tantai Xue&rsquo;s room, he discovered that Chu Feng was still chatting with Tantai Xue. The two of them had smiles on their faces and were chatting very joyously. There was no longer any trace of the sentimental feelings they had revealed earlier.<br>Upon seeing the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief, Chu Feng walked forward and said, &ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, let&rsquo;s set off right away.&rdquo;<br>Even though Chu Feng was here, he knew what had happened outside. He knew&hellip; that they must quickly take care of the Dark Hall, that they could not allow the Dark Hall time to prepare.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, I actually wanted to tell you to stay here to accompany our Lady Chieftain. You can leave the Dark Hall to us,&rdquo; The Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief said to Chu Feng.<br>The way he saw it, Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength was limited. Rather than following them into battle, it would be safer for him to stay here.<br>However, Chu Feng shook his head. He said, &ldquo;This matter concerns me deeply. No matter what, I must go. Even if my strength might be limited, I must still personally see to the death of that Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Seeing Chu Feng acting like this, the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief appeared to have been placed in a difficult situation. However, in the end, he smiled and said, &ldquo;Very well then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, wait a moment,&rdquo; However, right at the moment when the two of them were about to leave, Tantai Xue suddenly spoke to stop them. Then, she said to the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief, &ldquo;Senior, I have one thing I would like to request of you. I hope that you will agree to it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lady Chieftain, you are our Chieftain. Whatever it is, you can just command me. As long as I am able to accomplish it, I will definitely do it. Even if it is impossible for me to accomplish, I will also do my best to attempt to accomplish it. I will definitely not go against your orders,&rdquo; The Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief said in a very serious manner. It could be seen that he was completely devoted to Tantai Xue.<br>Hearing those words, Tantai Xue revealed a relaxed expression. Then, she took an exquisite case from her Cosmos Sack.<br>&ldquo;Lady Chieftain, you couldn&rsquo;t possible be&hellip;&rdquo; Seeing that case, the expression of the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief immediately changed.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please allow me,&rdquo; Tantai Xue raised the case up high and abruptly kneeled before the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief.<br>However, before Tantai Xue&rsquo;s knees could hit the ground, the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief supported her with his arms. At that moment, the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief had an expression of helplessness across his face. He had a wry smile on his face as he said, &ldquo;That belongs to you. Regardless of what you wish to do with it, I will not stop you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thank you senior,&rdquo; Hearing those words, Tantai Xue smiled brilliantly. Then, she opened the case and handed it to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, take a look. Are you capable of refining it?&rdquo;<br>A burst of coldness immediately emitted from the opened case.<br>After the coldness spread out, Chu Feng was able to see that there was a walnut-sized pearl in the case.<br>At first glance, that pearl appeared like a glass pearl. There didn&rsquo;t seem to be anything special about it.<br>However, upon closer inspection, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed enormously, and intense shock appeared in his eyes.<br>Chu Feng saw a world of ice and snow in that pearl. Contained within that world of ice and snow were countless amounts of Icesnow Phoenixes. They were spiraling around in that world.<br>After seeing all that, Chu Feng felt an incomparably strong Natural Energy being emitted from that pearl. That natural energy assailed Chu Feng directly in the face.<br>Furthermore, that Natural Energy was incomparably pure. It did not possess any berserk nature. Not to mention Chu Feng, even ordinary people would be able to absorb and refine it.<br>The Natural Energy was truly too dense. It was so unimaginably dense. It could be said to be the densest amount of Natural Energy Chu Feng had ever encountered so far. Most importantly, such a dense amount of Natural Energy was actually not berserk in the slightest.<br>That was most definitely a treasure, an exceptional treasure, a priceless treasure. Even the Imperial Armaments that everyone wanted to obtain in the Holy Land of Martialism would be greatly inferior to that pearl&rsquo;s preciousness.<br>&ldquo;This is?!!!!&rdquo; Overwhelmed with shock, Chu Feng wanted to ask about the pearl&rsquo;s origin.<br>&ldquo;That is our Icesnow Phoenix Race&rsquo;s Clan Protection Treasure. It has been passed on from the Ancient Era, and kept safe by our successive Clan Chiefs. It is a cultivation resource that only our Clan Chiefs use,&rdquo; The Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually that precious?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart tightened. He knew he would be able to obtain enormous power should he refine that pearl. Furthermore, what he needed the most right now was to increase his cultivation. In other words, that pearl was what Chu Feng needed the most.<br>After sensing the Natural Energy contained within the pearl, the first thing that came to Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind was that his cultivation would be able to increase again.<br>But, after he discovered the origin of that pearl, Chu Feng started to hesitate. The reason for that was because that pearl was extremely significant to the Icesnow Phoenixes.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, I have heard from Lady Chieftain that you possess a special method that could allow you to refine Natural Energies all at once. Furthermore, you are able to perfectly absorb all of the Natural Energy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The purpose of this pearl&rsquo;s existence is to increase the cultivation of our Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chiefs. However, the method with which our Icesnow Phoenixes increase our cultivation is by relying on our own Bloodline&rsquo;s power and training with it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To us, that pearl is actually not extremely effective in assisting with our cultivation. As of now, it is nothing more than a souvenir.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If little friend Chu feng is truly capable of utilizing that pearl to perfection and completely refining all of the Natural Energy contained within it, it would be a good thing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, Lady Chieftain has already determined to give it to you. Thus, it already no longer belongs to our Icesnow Phoenix Race. Instead, it is yours now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, little friend Chu Feng, you must definitely not decline it. If you&rsquo;re truly able to refine it, then go ahead and refine it,&rdquo; The Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief said with a beaming smile. Although he was reluctant to part with the pearl, he still respected Tantai Xue&rsquo;s decision.<br><br></p></div>
