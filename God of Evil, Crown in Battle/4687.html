        <h1>Chapter 4686</h1>
        <div>: Great Calamity<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Three days is up. Lad, I&rsquo;ve already chosen a suitable elder to lead the way for you,&rdquo; the mysterious voice sounded all of a sudden.<br>Following that, Chu Feng&rsquo;s surroundings began to distort. By the time everything reverted back to normal, he had already left the cavern to enter a brand new world.<br>He found himself standing in the midst of a grass field, where there was a cottage made out of stones. The cottage was small, but it was exquisite. It didn&rsquo;t look out-of-place despite being in the midst of the grass field; on the contrary, they seemed to accentuate one another. It was almost as if it had belonged in this grass field right from the start.<br>&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be an illusion this time, right?&rdquo;<br>However, what Chu Feng was more concerned about was whether the place he was in was real or not. It couldn&rsquo;t be helped that he was so suspicious about it; the illusions he had encountered in the Hidden Dragon Selection Formation were simply too lifelike that his distinction between reality and illusion was blurred.<br>It was only natural for him to doubt the current scenery before him too. The earth looked normal to him, but he couldn&rsquo;t help notice that there was something different about the sky. There were dark clouds rolling above, filling up the whole sky. Thunderous rumbling could be constantly heard, and they were accompanied by a pair of purple lightning.<br>These purple lightning filled up the sky, and they always appeared in pairs. It was almost like pairs of purple eyes were peering at the world beneath the dark clouds.<br>He didn&rsquo;t sense any danger coming from the purple lightning, but still, such an occurrence was still unnerving.<br>Chu Feng tried to look at it using Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, but he couldn&rsquo;t see through what the purple lightning was. He was unable to discern whether it was just a phenomenon or the arrival of a calamity.<br>In any case, he didn&rsquo;t feel too good about the purple lightning above.<br>Boom!<br>While Chu Feng was looking around, the doors to the stone cottage suddenly opened, and a white-haired old man dressed in simple clothes walked out. He had a clean appearance.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your business here?&rdquo; the old man asked.<br>Before Chu Feng could respond, the old man&rsquo;s body suddenly shuddered, as if he had been possessed by a spirit. This occurrence only continued for an instant before the old man recovered.<br>The old man turned his gaze back upon Chu Feng, but this time around, he had a complicated look in his eyes. There was a doubtful look in his eyes. He felt like he recognized Chu Feng, yet not really so.<br>&ldquo;This person&rsquo;s name is Duan Liufeng. He bears the &lsquo;Feng&rsquo; character in his name as well; it looks like the two of you have quite some fate. He shall be the elder who&rsquo;ll lead you into the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>&ldquo;Remember this. You were cultivating outside when you met Duan Liufeng, and when he told you that you could join the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to become one of its disciples, you followed him here. You aren&rsquo;t really aware of any of the details.&rdquo;<br>A voice transmission was delivered into Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears. It was the mysterious voice from before.<br>&ldquo;Elder, am I allowed to talk about your affairs in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He was asking this question because he could tell that the mysterious voice was an elusive figure who was hiding from public view at the moment. The mysterious voice was definitely related to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, but this relationship appeared to be a little peculiar.<br>However, even though Chu Feng had sent his voice transmission in response to where the mysterious voice had come from, he didn&rsquo;t receive a reply to his question.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, follow me.&rdquo;<br>The elder named Duan Liufeng suddenly instructed Chu Feng. The doubt in his eyes had vanished, as if he had convinced himself that he was truly acquainted with Chu Feng.<br>The mysterious voice had tampered with his memories, and Duan Liufeng seemed to be coming to terms with his altered memories. He earnestly believed that Chu Feng was someone from the outside whom he was bringing into the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>Chu Feng quickly followed Duan Liufeng while secretly assessing him.<br>He wanted to see how strong Duan Liufeng was, but he soon noticed that the latter&rsquo;s clothes were made out of special material. Unless he were to use his means, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see through his cultivation.<br>Chu Feng found his curiosity about the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect further increasing. He continued walking with Duan Liufeng for a moment longer before asking, &ldquo;Elder.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You may call me Elder Duan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Elder Duan, did something happen to the sky here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite a curious one.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s probably no one in the world who wouldn&rsquo;t be curious at such an imposing sight.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Well, I guess it&rsquo;s fine to tell you. Your memories would be erased if you can&rsquo;t clear the test anyway, and you&rsquo;ll be forcefully evicted from the sect. And if you do clear the test, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time that you learn about it,&rdquo; Elder Duan remarked.<br>&ldquo;This is a calamity that falls upon the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect once every decade. If we can&rsquo;t resolve it in time, it&rsquo;ll destroy the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect,&rdquo; Elder Duan replied.<br>&ldquo;Once every decade? Are all of the calamities the same?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was asking this question out of curiosity. If the same calamity occurred every decade, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect should have already devised a way to deal with it, making it nothing to be feared.<br>However, if the calamity changed every time, it would probably be much more troublesome.<br>&ldquo;The calamities used to be the same, but it&rsquo;s different this time around. The past calamities can be easily resolved by the interference of the vice sect leader, but this one has already lasted for three days now despite the vice sect leader working together with several Hidden Dragon Elders to resolve it. It looks like we&rsquo;ll have to wait for the sect leader to come out of his closed-door training in order to resolve this calamity,&rdquo; Elder Duan replied.<br>&ldquo;This calamity has already lasted for three days? This can&rsquo;t have something to do with me, can it?&rdquo; Chu Feng thought in astonishment.<br>&ldquo;Elder Duan, do you know of the Hidden Dragon Selection Formation?&rdquo;<br>Elder Duan immediately halted his footsteps, and he turned around to look at Chu Feng. There was a complicated look in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;You know of the Hidden Dragon Selection Formation? Who told you about it?&rdquo; Elder Duan asked grimly.<br></p></div>
