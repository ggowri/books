        <div> - The Perfect Vessel<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Come brother, l-le-le-let the two of us properly c-chat with one an-another.&rdquo;<br>Wang Qiang arrived before Chu Feng and placed his hand on his shoulder. With a leap, he flew upward with Chu Feng.<br>When the two of them landed, they were far away from the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen, and in a forest.<br>This forest was very strange. Like the ground, the trees were all ink black.<br>Furthermore, there was not a single leaf on any of the trees. All of them were completely bare.<br>The tree branches were like sharp blades. It seemed like they were composed of countless sharp blades.<br>That said, although the forest was extremely strange, there was a lake within the forest.<br>The lake was not very large. However, it was very clear.<br>This lake was very beautiful. It was so beautiful that the surrounding strange and desolate scenery appeared to be very inharmonious with it.<br>&ldquo;Come, h-have a taste&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;T-this is g-good stuff,&rdquo; as Wang Qiang spoke, he directly placed his hand into the lake, cupped out a handful of lake water, and drank it.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng also walked over and, like Wang Qiang, cupped a handful of water with his hand and drank it.<br>&ldquo;This lake water contains natural energies?!&rdquo; A surprised look appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Not only was the lake water tasty and sweet, but it also contained natural energies. The natural energies were very well-hidden. Had he not drunk the water, Chu Feng would not have been able to detect that it was actually a precious cultivation resource.<br>&ldquo;T-there&rsquo;s a lot m-more good s-stuff here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Un-un-unfortunately brother, I&rsquo;m a-afraid that you w-will not be able t-to stay h-her-here for long,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what is going on here? Is that Qin Kunlun really alive?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The one who met us in the Void Sacred Tree earlier, was that Qin Kunlun?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, your cultivation, did you gain that by training here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Say n-no more. My c-cultivation is d-d-different from yours, you&rsquo;ve relied o-on your own ability to increase your cultivation, you&rsquo;ve ob-ob-obtained your cultivation honorably, and that i-is-is worthy of respect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for me, t-this cu-cultivation was not earned by my own ability. Instead, it w-was forcibly instilled into me,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Forcibly instilled into you??&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression immediately changed enormously upon hearing those words. He had a bad feeling.<br>Relying on another&rsquo;s power to increase one&rsquo;s cultivation was a path on the path of martial cultivation.<br>Something like forcibly instilling cultivation was not uncommon either.<br>However, after having cultivation forcibly instilled, one would suffer enormous pain. It was a torture that would make one wish they were dead.<br>The stronger the cultivation that was instilled, the more pain one would have to endure.<br>Furthermore, having cultivation forcibly instilled would greatly affect one&rsquo;s future.<br>In simpler terms, if one possessed exceptional talent and was capable of reaching the Utmost Exalted realm through training by oneself, it would merely take that person a bit longer to train in order to reach the Utmost Exalted realm.<br>However, if that same person, with the same level of talent, decided to seek instant benefits by having cultivation forcibly instilled into them by another, although that person&rsquo;s cultivation might increase enormously in a short period of time, they would be destined to pay a price for that quick increase in cultivation.<br>As for the price, it might be that that person would no longer be able to reach the Utmost Exalted realm their entire life. In fact, they might not even be able to reach rank one Exalted.<br>In short, the more cultivation that was instilled, the more talent one would lose.<br>Unless the person who instilled the cultivation was extremely powerful, the damage caused by the process would be unavoidable.<br>That was the reason why Chu Feng was so worried, so much that he used his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to inspect Wang Qiang.<br>Upon inspecting Wang Qiang with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, Chu Feng grew furious.<br>Through his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to tell that Wang Qiang&rsquo;s body was covered in scars, sinister-looking scars. Those scars were formed through repeated lacerations and healing.<br>Through the scars, he was able to tell that Wang Qiang had most definitely not only suffered physical pain. His soul had also been tormented by the instillation of cultivation.<br>&ldquo;Who did this to you?! Was it that Qin Kunlun?!&rdquo; Chu Feng was so furious that his voice was trembling.<br>Through his understanding of Wang Qiang, Chu Feng knew that he would not accept having others instill cultivation into him. Thus, he must have been forced.<br>Chu Feng was simply unable to tolerate his brother being forced to suffer such torture.<br>&ldquo;Brother, it-it&rsquo;s alright. I&rsquo;ve m-merely t-taken a shortcut, that&rsquo;s all. There&rsquo;s n-not much lingering e-effect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;L-look at me, I&rsquo;m e-even stronger than you now. Haha.&rdquo;<br>Wang Qiang was able to tell that Chu Feng had detected the scars on his body. Fearing that Chu Feng would worry for him, he opened his mouth and laughed loudly.<br>&ldquo;So it really was that Qin Kunlun?!&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Qin Kunlun? T-there&rsquo;s no such person,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t exist? Then who is the Blood-devouring Demon Clan seeking? Who was the person that forcibly instilled cultivation into you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tell me, exactly who did all of this?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;B-brother, d-don&rsquo;t be in a rush. I-it&rsquo;s n-not as d-dreadful as you imagine it t-to be,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo; Chu Feng grabbed Wang Qiang.<br>Seeing such a determined Chu Feng, Wang Qiang helplessly opened his mouth and said, &ldquo;Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Blood-devouring Demon Exalted?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart tensed up upon hearing those words. That name sounded so familiar, yet so strange.<br>After hearing Wang Qiang&rsquo;s explanation, Chu Feng learned who the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was.<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was a being that had existed since the time of the Ancient Era, and was a truly powerful existence.<br>Otherwise, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible for it to be able to remain alive even after all the Ancient Era&rsquo;s cultivators had died.<br>Qin Kunlun, whose name had resonated throughout the Holy Light Galaxy, was actually only a person with an average talent for martial cultivation.<br>Although his talent for martial cultivation was mediocre, he possessed a rather special body, which was extremely suitable to house the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>Because of that, he was selected by the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted and became its vessel, fusing with the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>Qin Kunlun&rsquo;s later attainments were all because of the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. It was because it had fused with him that he had gained his extraordinary talent and astonishing power.<br>The Demon Exalted Divine Body that Qin Kunlun was famed for was actually a power unique to the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>Although Qin Kunlun had managed to retain his own consciousness and became a peak existence in the Holy Light Starfield with the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s power, although he had managed to gain enormous benefits with the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s assistance, he still had to pay a certain price for it.<br>Not long after he came to power, his soul started to become unable to sustain the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. With that, he started to weaken.<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted knew that Qin Kunlun&rsquo;s body would soon fail to sustain it, and began to think of every possible method to seek out a new vessel.<br>By pure coincidence, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted obtained a prophecy. The prophecy indicated for it to come to the Void Sacred Tree and wait there.<br>The prophecy stated that as long as it waited patiently, it would one day encounter its perfect vessel there.<br>Because of that, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted came to the Void Sacred Tree, and Qin Kunlun, whose name had shaken the entire Holy Light Galaxy, mysteriously disappeared.<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted waited for many years in the Void Sacred Tree for the arrival of its perfect vessel.<br>During that time, it encountered the first clan chief of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan, and imparted its Blood-devouring Demon Technique to him. That was how the Blood-devouring Demon Clan came into existence.<br>Thus, the Lord Qin Kunlun that the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke of was actually the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Then who&rsquo;s the perfect vessel? It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be you, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng looked at Wang Qiang. The expression of worry on his face grew even more intense.<br>&ldquo;I did-did-didn&rsquo;t want to admit it. However, I-I-I know that I can&rsquo;t keep it from y-you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother, I a-am indeed the perfect v-vessel t-that old f-fart was w-waiting for,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br></p></div>
