        <h1>Chapter 1793</h1>
        <div> - Are You Looking For Me?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you right now. Unfortunately, you won&rsquo;t be able to see it.&rdquo;<br>As Leng Yue spoke, the golden light grew even brighter. Then, she tossed the golden seal toward Chu Feng.<br>Once the golden seal was tossed, it started to shoot straight toward Chu Feng at an extremely fast speed.<br>Most importantly, that golden seal contained an incomparably frightening power. Even Chu Feng was astonished by its might.<br>If that golden seal were to strike Chu Feng, he would be met with a horrible death, with a torn body and crushed bones. Both his body and soul would be destroyed.<br>However, although the golden seal was very powerful, Chu Feng was able to clearly see the trajectory of its attack. Using the Azure Dragon Dashing Technique, Chu Feng dodged to the side and dodged the golden seal&rsquo;s attack.<br>&ldquo;He actually dodged it? How could this be?&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng had dodged the Heaven Taboo: Dao Light Seal, Leng Yue&rsquo;s eyebrows rose in shock. She was very surprised.<br>She knew the Heaven Taboo: Dao Light Seal&rsquo;s characteristics very well. Other than its overbearingly powerful might, the light emitted by it was capable of blocking one&rsquo;s opponent&rsquo;s line of sight. From there , it would be able to launch a surprise attack that one&rsquo;s opponent could not dodge.<br>Furthermore, that golden light was extremely powerful in blocking one&rsquo;s opponent&rsquo;s line of sight. Even Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists would not be able to see through it.<br>&ldquo;Could it be luck?&rdquo;<br>Leng Yue had no choice but to think that Chu Feng had managed to dodge the attack with luck. Thus, with a wave of her hand, the golden seal began to shoot straight at Chu Feng once again.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, like before, azure light flashed underneath Chu Feng&rsquo;s feet. Once again, he had dodged the golden seal.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not luck. He is actually capable of seeing the trajectory of the Heaven Taboo: Dao Light Seal.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng, exactly how many more tricks does he have up his sleeve?&rdquo; Leng Yue started to frown, and her gaze became serious.<br>Although she had indeed not placed Chu Feng in her eyes in the beginning, as matters stood, she now had no choice but to admit that Chu Feng was a very frightening opponent.<br>&ldquo;Since you can see it, then we&rsquo;ll see whether you will be able to match its speed,&rdquo; Leng Yue began to form hand seals with her hands. Then, the golden light grew even more dazzling, and the golden seal&rsquo;s speed also increased.<br>While trying his hardest to escape, Chu Feng shouted, &ldquo;Damn it, is this the power of a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill? How am I to defeat it? Leng Yue, can we not just call it off?&rdquo; At this moment, panic filled his face. He&hellip; was scared.<br>&ldquo;Humph, continue to beg. Even if you are to beg me for forgiveness, I will still not let you off,&rdquo; Seeing Chu Feng, who had been toying with her since the very beginning, running around all over the place while panicking in fear and even trying to reconcile with her, Leng Yue revealed an expression of complacence and malice.<br>As matters stood, she had unleashed all of her trump cards. Fortunately&hellip; she had managed to obtain absolute superiority.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, who would&rsquo;ve expected that even you would have such a day. However, it&rsquo;s too late. Everything is too late.&rdquo;<br>Had it been at the very beginning, Leng Yue might have decided to let Chu Feng off. After all, this was Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor&rsquo;s territory, and Chu Feng possessed quite a good relationship with that Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor. It would naturally not be sensible for her to kill Chu Feng in this place.<br>However, upon discovering that Chu Feng possessed six secret skills on him, she would absolutely not let Chu Feng live. She was determined to obtain those six supreme secret skills.<br>&ldquo;Leng Yue, you damned bitch! We clearly said that this was just sparring. Yet, you want to kill me. I&rsquo;ll bring you down!&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s grievance was overflowing. He began to curse out at Leng Yue nonstop. At the same time he cursed at Leng Yue, he also began to try to approach her.<br>However, as Chu Feng staggered along in mid air while trying to frantically escape from Leng Yue&rsquo;s golden seal, no matter how one looked at him, he seemed to be stuck in a dilemma.<br>&ldquo;Have you lost your ability to reason? You want to give your all to attempt to take me down?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come. Regardless of what sort of ability you might have, you will still undoubtedly be killed today. My Heaven Taboo: Dao Light Seal is most definitely beyond your imagination.&rdquo;<br>The more Chu Feng cursed, the more joyous Leng Yue felt. The way she saw it, Chu Feng was already no longer a threat.<br>&ldquo;Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash!!!&rdquo;<br>Finally, Chu Feng found an opportunity. He unleashed his Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash and sent out nine slashes in succession.<br>However, Leng Yue did not bother to pay attention to Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack at all. She continued to control that golden seal to attack Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Boom, boom, boom, boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, the nine successive slashes of the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash all exploded. They were all blocked by the golden light that covered Leng Yue.<br>&ldquo;Hahahahahaha&hellip;&rdquo; Leng Yue burst into loud laughter. She looked at Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Did you really think that my body would not be protected just because my golden seal had gone to chase after you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I might as well tell you this: my Heaven Taboo: Dao Light Seal is capable of attacking and defending at the same time. The one chasing after you is its offensive ability, whereas the one protecting me is its defensive ability.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For the current you, even if you are to put forth all of your strength, you will not be able to injure me in the slightest. You don&rsquo;t have to try so hard to approach me. I will not stop you. I&rsquo;ll allow you to come toward me. Come, attack me. Today, I shall let you know exactly what is meant by despair.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo; Leng Yue opened her arms wide and revealed an appearance of telling Chu Feng to attack her.<br>Although she had acted like this, the golden seal that had been chasing after Chu Feng was still chasing him.<br>&ldquo;Leng Yue, you are forcing me here. Quickly, stop right now. Else, I will no longer hold back,&rdquo; Chu Feng shouted.<br>&ldquo;No longer hold back? Come, show me how you&rsquo;ll stop holding back.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You only know about boasting and nothing else. What sort of man are you?&rdquo;<br>The more Leng Yue laughed, the more frantic her laughter became. At this moment, Chu Feng was akin to a clown before her.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the truth. I possess a treasure. If I am to use it, even rank two Martial Emperors will be killed. Even your Heaven Taboo: Dao Light Seal will not be able to protect you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, in respect to the Heavenly Law Palace, I do not wish to kill you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Come, you must take it out and broaden my horizons. So what if I am killed?&rdquo; Leng Yue said with a disapproving expression. She did not believe that Chu Feng possessed a treasure capable of killing rank two Martial Emperors.<br>&ldquo;Leng Yue, you are truly forcing me into a corner here! Fucking hell! You damned bitch!&rdquo; In great anger, Chu Feng started to curse wildly.<br>&ldquo;The outcome of the battle is already decided. Chu Feng&hellip; is already defeated,&rdquo; Seeing the scene in the sky, Baili Xinghe finally revealed a relaxed smile.<br>Like Leng Yue, he also felt that Chu Feng was acting like a clown right now. He no longer possessed the strength to continue to fight against Leng Yue.<br>As long as Chu Feng was killed, Baili Xinghe would have one less major enemy. Naturally, he would feel reassured at this moment.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; However, at the moment when both Leng Yue and Baili Xinghe were looking at Chu Feng as if he were a clown, the corners of Chu Feng&rsquo;s mouth lifted into a strange smile. He thought to himself, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s time for me to let you experience the special ability of the Black Tortoise Armor Technique.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body shifted. Following that, a boundless mist began to spread.<br>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;<br>When that fog began to spread, Leng Yue&rsquo;s vision was filled with confusion. At that very instant, illusions appeared before her.<br>&ldquo;Illusions? I was hallucinating earlier. That Chu Feng had actually used a hallucinatory ability?&rdquo; At this moment, Leng Yue had regained her awareness. However, panic filled her face, because she was shocked to discover that the Chu Feng who had been fleeing before her had disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Are you looking for me?&rdquo; Right at this moment, faint laughter suddenly sounded from behind Leng Yue.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you!!!&rdquo; Hearing this voice, Leng Yue grew nervous. She turned around and discovered that not only was Chu Feng behind her, he was less than ten meters away from her.<br>Logically, it should be impossible for Chu Feng to get that close to her, as she was protected by the golden light. However, Chu Feng was precisely that close to her.<br></p></div>
