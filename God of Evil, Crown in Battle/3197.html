        <h1>Chapter 3196</h1>
        <div> - The Hope Of The Eastern Region<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We are unable to enter that Formation of Light?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"Although the Formation of Light is activated through the New Excellence Formation, the newcomers are indeed incapable of entering it," Dongguo Bingyu said.<br>"Who is capable of enjoying the cultivation resources from that Formation of Light?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"The ruler of the Overlord Region," Dongguo Bingyu said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng finally realized why that woman from the Linghu Heavenly Clan cared so much about whether or not the Formation of Light would be able to be successfully opened.<br>It turned out that the opening of the Formation of Light concerned whether or not the Linghu Heavenly Clan would be able to enjoy cultivation resources.<br>"Snap~~~"<br>"Snap~~~"<br>Right at that moment, strange sounds suddenly began to sound from a spirit formation gate in the depths of the palace hall. At the same time, strange spirit power was emitted from that spirit formation gate.<br>That was indeed spirit power. However, it was different from normal spirit power, and turned into many pillars of light that flew toward the crowd.<br>In the end, the pillars of light shot into Chu Feng, Chu Qing, Chu Shuangshuang and the others.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng realized the spirit power should've come for them, newcomers that had entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm within that year.<br>The reason for that was because people like Dongguo Bingyu and the Mighty Dongguo Duo were not enveloped by that spirit power.<br>After being enveloped by the spirit power, Chu Feng and the others were able to feel the spirit power trying to communicate with them. It was as if the spirit power possessed awareness.<br>Right at that moment, the man from the Linghu Heavenly Clan shouted, "All newcomers, sit cross-legged immediately and focus on connecting with it!"<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng and the others immediately sat down cross-legged and began to let down their guard, allowing the spirit power to assimilate and connect with them.<br>"Buzz~~~"<br>After an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time passed, the spirit formation gate that had emitted the spirit power suddenly started to shine brightly. Spirit formation runes and symbols began to rush toward Chu Feng and the others' bodies like fish.<br>Afterwards, the spirit power condensed on Chu Feng and the others' foreheads.<br>Soon, the spirit power condensed into a symbol on their foreheads.<br>"The summoning is a success. The New Excellence Formation has been activated," seeing that, the crowd all let out joyous voices.<br>"All newcomers, use your spirit power to write your name and the power that you all belong to on the symbol on your forehead," the man from the Linghu Heavenly Clan said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng and the others immediately did as he said. However, there were also curious people that asked, "Milord, why do we need to do that?"<br>"The symbols on your foreheads are equivalent to your identity markers. As such, you all must inscribe your names on them."<br>"Right now, you have successfully opened the New Excellence Formation. Later on, the New Excellence Formation will summon you all into the grand formation. With your comprehension ability, you all should be able to enter the grand formation. However, there will be a difference in the speed at which you all will enter it."<br>"It goes without saying that the ones that enter the grand formation first will be able to obtain greater opportunities. Furthermore... the names of the first ten individuals to enter the grand formation will appear on the gate," the man from the Linghu Heavenly Clan said.<br>"In that case, it would mean that if I am to enter the grand formation first, my name will appear on the gate?" A man asked.<br>"If it's you, we can forget about it. The New Excellence Formation is summoned by newcomers from all four regions."<br>"I might as well tell you this. Of the four regions, the Eastern Region is the weakest. As such, the name of someone from the Eastern Region has never been on the gate," the woman from the Linghu Heavenly Clan said.<br>Hearing those words, the crowd that were originally looking forward to entering the New Excellence Formation inevitably revealed depressed looks on their faces.<br>They had originally thought themselves to be quite talented among the crowd present. If their names would appear and be ranked by who entered the grand formation first, they were confident that they would be able to be ranked.<br>In fact, there were even people among them that felt confident in being able to be ranked first.<br>However, if they were to be ranked together with the other three regions, they no longer possessed the confidence to do so.<br>The reason for that was because it was common knowledge that the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s Eastern Region was the weakest.<br>Thus, whilst they might be filled with confidence and even act arrogant and condescending towards others from the Eastern Region, they would not only lose all morale, but would even feel themselves to be inferior should they be placed with the people from the other three regions.<br>People like them were simply the archetype of those that bullied the weak and feared the strong.<br>Before those that were weaker than them, they would act as if they were gods, and be completely condescending toward commoners.<br>However, before those that were stronger than them, they would act like a bunch of grandsons, a bunch of cowards. They would fawn over them and would nearly kneel before them to lick their feet.<br>At this moment when the great majority of people were feeling disappointed and even depressed, Dongguo Bingyu, the Mighty Dongguo Duo and a small portion of the people present quietly turned their eyes to Chu Feng.<br>They already knew about Chu Xuanyuan's son's strength to some extent.<br>That person was far different from the other newcomers present.<br>They all felt that Chu Feng was capable of smashing through the mold of the past, that he would definitely be able to represent their Eastern Region and be ranked.<br>Merely, they had no idea what rank Chu Feng would be able to achieve.<br>That said, they had no idea that whilst they were wondering if Chu Feng would be able to rank among the top ten, another group of people were gathered in another palace hall in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm's Overlord Region.<br>That group of people were all from the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm's Northern Region. One power among them was particularly focused on by the crowd.<br>The reason for that was because that power was one of the Ancestral Martial Starfield's Ten Great Heavenly Clans, the Li Heavenly Clan.<br>The Li Heavenly Clan was one of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm's Western Region's overlords.<br>[1. It said western region here for some reason, will check with later <span>contents</span> to figure out.<br>In ch. 3138, it was mentioned that Bai Liluo drove the Li Heavenly Clansmen insane. However, it was a different Li Heavenly Clan. &#26446; vs. &#40654;. I have since changed the Li Heavenly Clan from ch 3138 to Lee Heavenly Clan.]<br>Furthermore, the Li Heavenly Clan's newcomers that had entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm this year were particularly strong.<br>The reason for that was because even one of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, Li Anzhi, had entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br></p></div>
