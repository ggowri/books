        <div><span>: You Mustn&rsquo;t!</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>Chu Feng found Bai Yunqing staring at him when he projected his consciousness back to his main body.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is that young miss doing better now?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked concernedly.</span><br><span>Even though he had started on a bad foot with Eggy, her willingness to lay down her life for Chu Feng left him with deep respect for her.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It helped. Speaking of which, do you know if there was an even more formidable world spiritist power that came before the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked out of curiosity.</span><br><span>Based on his deduction thus far, the creator of this place was likely to be stronger than both the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. That left him wondering which power was behind this place.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The Ancestral Martial Realm Sect was the first world spiritist organization to have ruled the world of cultivation. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that there was any world spiritist organization stronger than them,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is that the case?&rdquo; Chu Feng fell into deep thought.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother, why are you asking that?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing was intrigued.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt that the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect once took possession of this land, but I don&rsquo;t think that they were the creator of this trial,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You suspect that there was an even more powerful world spiritist organization before the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;They could have existed in the same era too. Whatever the case, there&rsquo;s no doubt that the creator of this land is extremely powerful,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing gasped in astonishment. &ldquo;Could there really be a world spiritist organization that was even stronger than the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect? But it doesn&rsquo;t make sense that there are no records on that.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not dwell too much about it now and head out first. Jie Yu and the others are probably anxiously waiting for us,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing smirked upon hearing those words. &ldquo;I reckon that they think that we&rsquo;re already dead.&rdquo;</span><br><span>He glanced at the crystals floating beside him and Chu Feng. His crystal harnessed the power of Royal Dragon Mark, whereas Chu Feng&rsquo;s crystal harnessed the power of Saint Dragon Mark, comparable to a pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritist.</span><br><span>Of course, this didn&rsquo;t mean that the cultivation resource contained within the crystal had really reached the level of Royal Dragon Mark and Saint Dragon Mark respectively, but it was proof of their capability.</span><br><span>Chu Feng grabbed his crystal and hid it in his hand.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother, why are you stowing away your crystal?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that we should give them a surprise?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a mischievous smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha! That sounds good to me.&rdquo; Knowing what Chu Feng was up to, Bai Yunqing also grabbed his crystal and hid it in his hand too.</span><br><span>The two of them then left the trial via the spirit formation gate. It teleported them to the foot of the mountain. Jie Yu, the other juniors from the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion, and the old woman were still lingering in the area.</span><br><span>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t dead yet?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Shocked exclamations echoed when Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing stepped out of the spirit formation gate. Even the old woman also cast surprised looks at them. It was almost as if they thought that it was a miracle that the two of them had come out of the trial alive.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you disappointed that we&rsquo;re alive?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked with a gleeful smile. He turned to Jie Yu and asked, &ldquo;Jie Yu, how did you do for the trial?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Did you think that you could win against me just because you got lucky?&rdquo; Jie Yu sneered.</span><br><span>While he was surprised that Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing had returned safely, that didn&rsquo;t mean that he was afraid of them. With a wave of his sleeves, he brought out a crystal suffused with the power of Royal Dragon Mark.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh? I guess you&rsquo;re not too bad. We actually tied,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Tied? What nonsense are you spouting?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion doubted the veracity of Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s words. This trial was not just about releasing psyche; how much and when to release it was also key to achieving a good result.</span><br><span>Jie Yu had been to this trial so many times that he knew how to allocate his psyche across the trials. On top of that, he had eaten a few pills to reinforce his psyche beforehand. That was how he was able to nourish the crystal to such an impressive extent.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing might be a prodigy too, but this was his first time in the trial and he didn&rsquo;t make any preparations beforehand. It was inconceivable for him to nourish the crystal to Jie Yu&rsquo;s level.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Open your eyes wide and take a good look at this!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing opened up his palm, and his crystal floated out.</span><br><span>The crowd rubbed and blinked their eyes in disbelief. To their shock, Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s crystal had really reached Royal Dragon Mark too! Furthermore, Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s crystal clearly boasted a higher purity than Jie Yu&rsquo;s even though they were of the same level.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How did you do it?&rdquo; Jie Yu was shocked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Simple. All you have to do is keep releasing your psyche,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you saying that you satiated all of the tests along the way?&rdquo; the old woman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course. How else do you think we escaped with our life?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing replied.</span><br><span>The old woman snorted in disdain, thinking that Bai Yunqing was lying. She knew that the psyche requirement would increase correspondingly to the number of people who entered each test. This meant it was impossible to satiate a test just by bringing more people in.</span><br><span>Thus far, there had been not a single person who had entered through the same entrance as Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing who came out unscathed. In fact, the old woman didn&rsquo;t think that they would be able to escape from there at all. Their survival was already a miracle, but they were going a step further to claim that they had satiated all of the tests.</span><br><span>Jie Yu didn&rsquo;t believe Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s words either, but he was glad that he didn&rsquo;t make the bet with Bai Yunqing. Otherwise, he would have lost the bet due to the difference in purity between their crystals.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, why aren&rsquo;t you saying anything? Are you embarrassed to speak up because of your poor results? You don&rsquo;t have to be. With my standing, you should consider it an honor to be able to call me your grandfather,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>He already knew that Chu Feng was only a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, which made him confident that Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t possibly beat him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll be able to make me call you &lsquo;grandfather&rsquo;, but I don&rsquo;t mind becoming yours instead,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he opened up his hand.</span><br><span>The moment his crystal floated from his palm, the crowd gasped.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How can he possibly nourish a crystal of this level?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd couldn&rsquo;t believe their eyes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It must be a fake! They must be cheating! Elder, they are too shameless! They actually faked their results just so they could beat young master Jie Yu!&rdquo; a junior howled.</span><br><span>No one in their Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had ever achieved such a feat before, so they naturally assumed that no one else in the world of cultivation could do the same. The only possibility they could think of was that Chu Feng had faked the result.</span><br><span>The old woman walked over to verify Chu Feng&rsquo;s crystal, but the more she examined the crystal, the more awful her complexion became.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How did you do it?&rdquo; the old woman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t my brother already tell you?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo; The old woman harrumphed, refusing to believe Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, is the crystal real?&rdquo; Jie Yu asked the old woman.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how they did it, but the crystal is authentic,&rdquo; the old woman replied.</span><br><span>Jie Yu&rsquo;s face turned livid.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Jie Yu, I hope you aren&rsquo;t a sore loser. That will reflect badly on the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>Shoosh!</span><br><span>With a wave of his sleeves, Jie Yu tossed two items over to Chu Feng. One was the longevity pendant, and the other was the crystal Jie Yu had nourished.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What do you mean by this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; Jie Yu asked.</span><br><span>Clearly, Jie Yu didn&rsquo;t want to call Chu Feng &lsquo;grandfather&rsquo;, so he was hoping to call it quits by offering the crystal he had nourished in exchange.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I advise you to know your place.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Know whose land you are standing on right now.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you really think that you have any say here?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion sent threats to Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you resorting to intimidation after losing to me? If you are going to threaten me, just say it out loud. Don&rsquo;t you feel embarrassed threatening someone else through voice transmission?&rdquo; Chu Feng mocked.</span><br><span>Having their shameful behavior pointed out further infuriated the juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re getting ahead of yourself!&rdquo; a junior furiously pointed his finger at Chu Feng and roared.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Jie Yu glared at the juniors behind him.</span><br><span>The juniors quickly shut their mouths.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I admit that I have lost, but you shouldn&rsquo;t get too arrogant either. I refuse to abide by our bet because I don&rsquo;t think that you won with your own strength. I concede that I have no idea how you managed to nourish a crystal of that level, but I suspect that you might have unwittingly received the help of our predecessors. After all, that trial is one that many of our predecessors have challenged. They must have paved the way with their blood and flesh, whereas you happened to enter the trial at the right time to reap the fruits of their sacrifice,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to worm your way out of this situation by crediting my success to your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion? Interesting. Jie Yu, you&rsquo;re more shameless than I thought,&rdquo; Chu Feng scoffed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It makes me cringe seeing how much of a sore loser you are. Don&rsquo;t you feel ashamed making such a forced argument?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing added.</span><br><span>Jie Yu&rsquo;s face turned awful.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I am willing to accept my defeat, but only if you really accomplish this feat with your own strength. How about this? I&rsquo;ll have another bet with you. If you lose, I&rsquo;ll only ask you to call this matter quits, but if you win, I&rsquo;ll give this to you.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Yu reached into his Cosmos Sack and took out an exquisite box. The old woman&rsquo;s eyes widened when she saw the box.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t, young master Jie Yu!&rdquo;</span><br></p></div>
