        <h1>Chapter 3512</h1>
        <div> - Unleashing One&rsquo;s Extraordinary Ability<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Saint level spirit power. Could it be&hellip; Chu Feng is&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Whilst the people of the younger generation felt disbelief, those from the older generation had no choice but to believe it. After all, they were all experienced people, and capable of recognizing that the spirit power Chu Feng released was indeed Saint-level spirit power.<br>Faced with their complicated gazes, Chu Feng did not say anything.<br>It was instead Li Ruochu who spoke, &ldquo;As everyone can see, Chu Feng is&hellip; a Saint-cloak World Spiritist. That is the reason why I asked him to come here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Elder Taiyi, dare I ask, does this constitute a crime of betraying one&rsquo;s clan?&rdquo; Li Ruochu looked to Li Taiyi.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; I&hellip;&rdquo; Li Taiyi had a very ugly expression on his face. He was at a loss for how to respond.<br>Compared to Li Taiyi, the crowd were mostly still astonished. They felt as if their heads had been violently smashed, rendering them momentarily stunned.<br>This was especially true for Li Tianyou and the other Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations that had fought Chu Feng before.<br>Even now, they still found it difficult to believe that Chu Feng was now a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>&ldquo;As expected of Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son. Although young friend Chu Feng is so young, you&rsquo;re already a Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Had I not witnessed it myself, not even this old man would believe it,&rdquo; the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief praised Chu Feng non-stop as he clapped his hands.<br>With a smile on his face, Chu Feng clasped his fist respectfully. &ldquo;Junior Chu Feng pays his respects to senior Dragon King Li.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng actually knows of me?&rdquo; The Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief returned a smile. Should it be another person of the younger generation, he would naturally not behave in such a manner. However, since Chu Feng was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, and one so young on top of that, he had no choice but to treat him earnestly.<br>Then, Chu Feng began to chat with the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief before the crowd.<br>Seeing their irritable Lord Clan Chief smiling as he chatted with Chu Feng, the Li Heavenly Clansmen felt more admiration and envy.<br>Dragon King Li had always been a harsh and strict person. Even they had never received such amiable treatment from their Lord Clan Chief.<br>Had they not witnessed it themselves, they would not believe that their Lord Clan Chief could actually possess such an affable side to him.<br>That said, they also felt admiration for Chu Feng at the same time. Even though he was clearly a person of the younger generation, he was able to remain calm and composed as he chatted wittily with their Lord Clan Chief. Although his tone remained very respectful, there was no trace of fear or pressure.<br>That was something impossible for them.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a loud rumble was heard. The Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation began to sway even stronger. The surrounding heaven and earth was also trembling violently.<br>Seeing that, the Li Heavenly Clansmen all started to frown.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, we don&rsquo;t know why this spirit formation would suddenly malfunction like this. As our capabilities are limited, we are powerless to deal with it. Today&hellip; it will all depend on you,&rdquo; the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please rest assured. I have already observed it earlier. I am able to enter this spirit formation. After entering it, I'll be able to make a thorough investigation as to exactly what is going on. I'll also do my best to stabilize it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the serious expression on the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s face was immediately covered by a smile again.<br>It was not only him who felt joyous; practically all of the Li Heavenly Clansmen felt very joyous.<br>Previously, they were worried that Chu Feng might be unable to breach the formation.<br>Whilst it was true that a Saint-cloak World Spiritist of Chu Feng&rsquo;s young age would possess the greatest chance in being able to enter the formation, they were still worried.<br>However, after hearing him speak with such certainty, over half of the worries that they held in their hearts disappeared.<br>To a greater or lesser degree, they had an understanding of his character, and knew that he was not a boastful individual.<br>&ldquo;Good. This is simply great. Young friend Chu Feng, in that case, the safety of our clan shall all depend on you,&rdquo; the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief bowed to Chu Feng respectfully.<br>&ldquo;Senior, whether or not I will help you today is not determined by me. Instead, it will depend on that person,&rdquo; as Chu Feng spoke, he looked to Li Taiyi.<br>His intention was extremely clear.<br>&ldquo;Taiyi, why are you still not apologizing to young friend Chu Feng for your rude behavior?&rdquo; Berserker Li asked.<br>&ldquo;Remember, it&rsquo;s an apology whilst kneeling,&rdquo; Chu Feng added.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, many of the Li Heavenly Clansmen felt very complicated.<br>Berserker Li had already given Chu Feng sufficient face by demanding that Li Taiyi apologize to him. They had all thought that Chu Feng would let Li Taiyi off with that.<br>After all, Li Taiyi was a Supreme Elder of their Li Heavenly Clan. To demand that he apologize to a person of the younger generation whilst kneeling, someone from a clan inferior to their Li Heavenly Clan on top of that, was simply impossible.<br>&ldquo;Li Taiyi, why are you still not apologizing?&rdquo; Berserker Li said to Li Taiyi again.<br>&ldquo;Allow me to clarify one more time. It&rsquo;s an apology whilst kneeling,&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke with a serious expression.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t you bully me intolerably!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What sort of place do you think this is? This is our Li Heavenly Clan!&rdquo;<br>Finally, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elders were unable to contain themselves, and began to criticize Chu Feng. Unconcealed anger was present on their faces.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng chuckled mockingly before saying, &ldquo;If the person standing here today were senior Wuming Xingyun or Grandmaster Liangqiu, would you all dare to speak like that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>The Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elders were left speechless as to how to refute Chu Feng.<br>If it were either Wuming Xingyun or Grandmaster Liangqiu, none of them would dare to speak to them in the same manner they did Chu Feng.<br>If they truly spoke to them in such a rude manner, not to mention apologizing while kneeling, they would not hesitate to even kowtow.<br>&ldquo;Bully intolerably? The way I see it, it&rsquo;s you all who are bullying me, Chu Feng, for being a person of the younger generation; bullying me for being from the Chu Heavenly Clan, that&rsquo;s inferior to your Li Heavenly Clan. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that I should not have come here today. Farewell,&rdquo; as Chu Feng spoke, he turned around and began to leave.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, please wait,&rdquo; suddenly, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke. Compared to the other elders&rsquo; criticisms of Chu Feng, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s attitude toward Chu Feng remained very amicable, and even somewhat respectful. He seemed to be very afraid that Chu Feng would leave.<br>&ldquo;Li Taiyi,&rdquo; then, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief turned his gaze to Li Taiyi.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, I&hellip;&rdquo; Li Taiyi felt very unwilling.<br>&ldquo;Kneel,&rdquo; the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s voice was not very resounding. Yet, it was filled with imposing might.<br>One could tell that Li Taiyi was stuck between a rock and a hard place.<br>Ultimately, Li Taiyi decided to, with a putt, kneel on the ground.<br>&ldquo;This old man was wrong. Please forgive me,&rdquo; after Li Taiyi finished saying those words, he immediately stood back up.<br>Although he immediately stood back up, the Li Heavenly Clansmen, especially those from the younger generation, were still completely stunned.<br>Even though Li Taiyi had only knelt symbolically, it remained that he had knelt to Chu Feng.<br>Li Taiyi, a Supreme Elder of the Li Heavenly Clan, actually knelt to a person of the younger generation from the Chu Heavenly Clan?!!!<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng burst into sudden laughter. Then, he said, &ldquo;Senior, you are truly courteous. Actually, Li Yue&rsquo;er and I are close friends. I have come here today precisely for her sake. Even if you didn&rsquo;t apologize to me, I would still go in.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo; Li Taiyi&rsquo;s face turned ashen with anger upon hearing those words.<br>It was not only him. Many others of the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elders and younger generations were also deeply enraged.<br>Chu Feng was simply toying with Li Taiyi.<br>Chu Feng completely ignored the furious Li Heavenly Clansmen. He turned around and looked to the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>At that moment, boundless spirit power began to flow out from his body in an unceasing manner.<br>Everyone present was able to sense just how powerful that spirit power was.<br>Such formidable spirit power was being controlled by Chu Feng like a magnificent army of thousands of men and horses.<br>Originally, the Li Heavenly Clansmen were very furious because Li Taiyi was forced to kneel to Chu Feng.<br>However, after witnessing his calmness as he stood here, they began to feel admiration towards his abilities.<br>A thought emerged in their hearts.<br>While it was true that Chu Feng was a Chu Heavenly Clansman and a person of the younger generation, with the capability that he had revealed, perhaps&hellip; he was really qualified to make Li Taiyi apologize to him.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body began to emit dazzling light.<br>That dazzling light gradually took the shape of a cloak.<br>Seeing that cloak, the crowd all revealed astonished expressions.<br>Merely by looking at it, they knew that that cloak was no ordinary item.<br>It was most definitely a rare treasure!!!<br>Yet, such a treasured cloak was being worn by Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
