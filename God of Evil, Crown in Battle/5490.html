        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awake, Chu Feng!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The room doors opened to reveal a couple of juniors standing by the doorway. Long Muxi and Long Chengyu were among them, but Chu Feng was surprised to see Long Fulai and Long Zhizhi there too.</span><br><span>In contrast to their first meeting, Long Zhizhi had a complicated expression on her face.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hoh! It looks like you have changed their impression of you,&rdquo; Eggy remarked with a deep smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;At least they aren&rsquo;t the type of people to envy and hate those who are stronger than them,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. People like Long Zhizhi are too used to looking down on others, but there&rsquo;s still hope for them.&rdquo; Eggy agreed with Chu Feng&rsquo;s opinion.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng has only just recovered, so let&rsquo;s not impose too much on him,&rdquo; Long Chengyu entered the room with Long Muxi before closing the doors behind him. &ldquo;Chu Feng, my father said you need some rest, which is why we were waiting outside. How are you feeling?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Much better than before. It&rsquo;s all thanks to the treasures you fed me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said. He knew that they must have fed him invaluable pills for him to accumulate such a vast amount of energy.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only right for us to do so. It&rsquo;s thanks to you that our Totem Dragon Clan obtained a God Taboo Martial Skill. Speaking of which, there&rsquo;s something I need to discuss with you.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Chengyu told Chu Feng that they were currently heading to the Immemorial Star Sea, mentioning that they had brought him along because they might need his help on a matter.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, we have acted on our own accord. You don&rsquo;t have to feel pressured to help us. Just follow your heart,&rdquo; Long Chengyu apologized.</span><br><span>He knew that it was rude of them to bring Chu Feng with them while he was still </span><span>unconscious.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. I&rsquo;ll help you if it&rsquo;s within my ability to do so,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re a good friend!&rdquo; Long Chengyu burst into laughter.</span><br><span>However, Milady Queen wasn&rsquo;t as happy about the situation. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they getting greedy? First they got you to acquire a God Taboo Martial Skill for them, and now they want you to go to what Immemorial Star&hellip; Hm? Is that the Immemorial Star Sea that Little Fishy conquered?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I doubt there&rsquo;ll be a second Immemorial Star Sea in the world of cultivation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You should ask about it!&rdquo; Eggy urged.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chengyu, is the Immemorial Star Sea we&rsquo;re heading to the same place that the little princess of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er, conquered?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Right right, that&rsquo;s the one!&rdquo; Long Chengyu excitedly nodded. His expression turned perverted. &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you actually know the little princess of the Immortal sea Fish Clan. It looks like our interests coincide!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Muxi glared at Long Chengyu, but the latter paid her no heed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying with curiosity to know how beautiful the little princess of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan is. Rumor has it that she&rsquo;s a fairy among fairies. I heard that she is still at the Immemorial Star Sea, so there might be a chance that we may cross paths with her,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>Before Chu Feng could respond to those words, Eggy had already exclaimed out loud, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great! We can finally meet Little Fishy again. It has been many years since we last met. She must be a gorgeous lady now.&rdquo;</span><br><span>She was so excited that she had forgotten about her previous complaints.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Will we meet?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured as he thought about his first meeting with Little Fishy.</span><br><span>He was still a young lad back then. There were so many powers in the Eastern Sea who towered over him. He had to tread carefully as if walking on a tightrope. Even though he was struggling himself, he still felt compelled to protect that innocent girl who looked as if she had no worries on her mind.</span><br><span>She was an anomaly in the world of cultivation, which was probably why she caught his eye in the first place.</span><br><span>He could still remember that giant hand that tore through space when Little Fishy&rsquo;s family members fetched her home. It still shook him up when he thought about it now.</span><br><span>However, the distance between them was no longer as great as it used to be.</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>Soon, Chu Feng and the others arrived at the Immemorial Star Sea. There were many people gathered in the vicinity, but the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s war chariots and warships were hidden by a concealment formation, so no one noticed their arrival.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is this really the Immemorial Star Sea? Why does it feel like a desert?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The juniors were perplexed. They had expected the Immemorial Star Sea to be a vast sea, but they were instead met with a boundless desert.</span><br><span>Even so, it was clear that this was no normal desert. For one, its sand was pristine white. The absence of wind was also extremely conspicuous, giving rise to an uncanny still scenery. In fact, it somehow felt stifling to stare at this scenery for a long time.</span><br><span>There was not a single person who entered the desert, be it by foot or by air. All cultivators in sight were at the entrance of the desert as if they were afraid of something.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The real Immemorial Star Sea only appears at night, but even so, it only appears at times. The daytime Immemorial Star Sea is a forbidden area. Those who dare to approach it will be swallowed whole,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief explained why none of the cultivators dared to approach the Immemorial Star Sea.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Father, does the stone monument only appear at night too?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it. The stone monument is currently too far away, so it can only be seen through special means. Rub this on your eyes and look in that direction. You should be able to see it if you look hard enough,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said as he passed a bunch of leaves to the crowd.</span><br><span>Chu Feng tried looking over with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, but the desert was bigger than he had expected. Thus, he tried rubbing the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s leaf on his eye, and it immediately enhanced his sight. It allowed him to see farther than what was possible with his current cultivation.</span><br><span>He looked over once more, and he soon noticed a colossal stone monument that was so big that he could feel its grandeur despite being such a far distance away. He would have surely looked insignificant next to it.</span><br><span>Inscribed on the monument were the words: &lsquo;Entrance to the Immemorial Star Sea&rsquo;. Chu Feng could sense from the domineering calligraphy that the person who had left those words behind was a formidable existence,</span><br><span>A commotion suddenly broke out.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What happened? Where&rsquo;s the name of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s little princess? Are those four characters her name?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The others also caught sight of the stone monument as well, and that was the reason behind the commotion.</span><br><span>Chu Feng frowned.</span><br><span>Based on what he had heard, Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s name should have been inscribed on the stone monument, but her name had become so blurred that it was hard to discern it.</span><br><span>There was another even blurrier name inscribed next to hers, but not even Chu Feng could make out what it was. However, he could tell that the name contained two characters.</span><br></p></div>
