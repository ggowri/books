        <h1>Chapter 4909</h1>
        <div>: Chu Feng&rsquo;s Protector<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You&hellip; Haaa, why won&rsquo;t you listen to my advice? You&rsquo;re really obstinate. Are you intentionally doing the opposite of what I suggested because you don&rsquo;t like me? Do you really think that I&rsquo;d harm you?&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian said with a pout.<br>She felt angered and indignant. She had made these suggestions with Chu Feng&rsquo;s welfare at heart. The rank seven Exalted Taboo Martial Skill she had recommended to Chu Feng was deemed to be the best in the Holy Valley.<br>Yet, Chu Feng insistently picked those that others looked down on.<br>&ldquo;You should trust my judgment,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a mysterious smile.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk to you anymore. You&rsquo;ll really be the death of me!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xintian turned her head away angrily, not even wanting to see Chu Feng anymore.<br>&ldquo;She looks really angry. Chu Feng, could there really be a problem with the martial skills you have picked?&rdquo; Yu Sha asked.<br>Even she was starting to doubt Chu Feng&rsquo;s judgment.<br>&ldquo;I trust my instincts. There&rsquo;s definitely nothing wrong with the martial skills I picked. If there&rsquo;s any problem here, it lies with the people who previously practiced them. They must have failed to grasp the essence of these three Exalted Taboos,&rdquo; Chu Feng said confidently.<br>Weng!<br>The bookshelf quickly morphed into a bundle of light that quickly converged into a white spirit formation gate. The spirit formation gate released a powerful suction force that dragged Chu Feng and Shengguang Xintian in.<br>The two of them found themselves returning to the entrance of the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium.<br>Shengguang Shishen and Shengguang Baimei were waiting for them there. Daoist Niantian and Shengguang Buyu had returned too.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I heard that you were able to pick three martial skills. What did you choose?&rdquo; Daoist Niantian asked.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask. Of all things, he had to choose the three most useless ones,&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian grumbled grudgingly.<br>She proceeded to tell the crowd what Chu Feng picked.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The members of the Holy Valley reacted the same way that Shengguang Xintian did upon hearing about Chu Feng&rsquo;s selection. None of them thought well of those three Exalted Taboos.<br>However, there was one person who wasn&rsquo;t too surprised to hear about it<br>Shengguang Qianyu.<br>&ldquo;As expected of Brother Chu Feng. You must be confident of putting those three Exalted Taboos to good use?&rdquo; Shengguang Qianyu asked.<br>&ldquo;I just think that those three Exalted Taboos suit me better. As for whether I can put them to good use or not&hellip; I believe that I should be able to do it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;As expected of young hero Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>The crowd burst into laughter, but there wasn&rsquo;t any hint of disdain in their voices.<br>Had it been anyone else, they might have just thought that it was arrogance and scorned him. After all, they had a good idea what those three Exalted Taboos were like.<br>However, those words took a different meaning when coming out of Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. Somehow, they felt that Chu Feng might just be able to pull it off.<br>After all, he had accomplished far too many things beyond what they imagined to be possible. They couldn&rsquo;t think of him as just another ordinary cultivator anymore.<br>&ldquo;Xintian, we have witnessed young hero Chu Feng&rsquo;s talents with our own eyes. Just because we aren&rsquo;t able to master it doesn&rsquo;t mean that he isn&rsquo;t able to do so,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei told Shengguang Xintian.<br>&ldquo;What else can he do? He has already chosen them,&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian said with a helpless sigh.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, I have prepared a banquet for you and your friends as a symbol of my apology. After the banquet, I&rsquo;ll personally bring you to the Holy Light Clan to teach Shengguang Xuanye a lesson. I&rsquo;ll make sure that he apologizes to you in public,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>&ldquo;Teach Shengguang Xuanye a lesson? How do you intend to do that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; To be honest with you, young hero Chu Feng, Shengguang Xuanye and the Holy Light Clan share the same origins as our Holy Valley. We&rsquo;re aware of everything he has done over the years, but we can&rsquo;t just sentence him to death.<br>&ldquo;However, you need not worry. Even if he&rsquo;s spared from death, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that he&rsquo;ll be able to get away scot-free. Our Holy Valley will be taking charge of the Holy Light Galaxy in the future, so you need not worry about him anymore,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>Chu Feng had anticipated this answer, so he chose not to pursue it. Instead, he looked at Shengguang Baimei with a smile and asked, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually quite curious as to what happened for you to suddenly change your attitude toward me. We&rsquo;re all smart people here, so there&rsquo;s no need to beat around the bush. Just get straight to the point.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, are you really unaware of it or are you just teasing us?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fond of such tasteless tricks. I wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered asking you if I really knew of the reason,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I was blind and ignorant. I didn&rsquo;t know that young hero Chu Feng has such strong backing. If you had said so earlier, I would have never dared to&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Ahh, it&rsquo;s all my fault. I should have never gotten so arrogant in the first place,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>&ldquo;Strong backing? Who are you referring to?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, are you unaware of who your backing is?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei exclaimed in astonishment.<br>He thought Chu Feng would understand what he was getting at right away, but the latter looked confused at his words.<br>In truth, Chu Feng was indeed unaware of the backing that Shengguang Baimei spoke of, but it did perfectly explain the latter&rsquo;s change in attitude. For that reason, he didn&rsquo;t deny the matter.<br>Instead, he said, &ldquo;I have indeed encountered quite a few venerated elders in the past, and from time to time, I&rsquo;d receive help from someone when I encounter danger. I&rsquo;m not too sure who it is this time around.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I see&hellip; Young hero Chu Feng, may I know who are the venerated elders you have met?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that I&rsquo;m not in a position to divulge their identity. You just have to tell me who is the one who came to the Holy Valley.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was curious to know the identity of the person who saved him from danger. He would make sure to repay this favor in the future.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll be honest with you.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei told Chu Feng about how they found out about Chu Feng&rsquo;s backing.<br>&ldquo;It looks like someone is really guarding you. The Holy Valley must be certain of this matter, or else Shengguang Baimei wouldn&rsquo;t take such a subservient attitude to you. Chu Feng, who do you think that person is?&rdquo; Yu Sha asked out of curiosity.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing that it could be the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster. I can&rsquo;t think of anyone else other than her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>The one who best fitted the criteria in terms of strength and motive was the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;She really has a soft heart if that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; Yu Sha remarked.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, are you really unaware of the identity of the person protecting you?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei and the others looked at Chu Feng intently. They were more curious than Chu Feng to know who that person was. After all, that person could easily determine the standing of the Holy Valley in the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>&ldquo;I have an idea in mind, but I&rsquo;m not in a good position to divulge his identity. I&rsquo;ll have to ask you not to probe any further. As long as you don&rsquo;t commit atrocities, that person wouldn&rsquo;t trouble the Holy Valley. However, I ought to remind you that if he really loses his temper, a calamity might just fall upon the Holy Valley.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was saying those words to curb the Holy Valley. Shengguang Baimei&rsquo;s earlier words made it clear that the Holy Valley would soon be replacing the Holy Light Clan as the overlord of the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>However, the Holy Valley didn&rsquo;t look any better than the Holy Light Clan in terms of how they conducted themselves. He felt that there was a need to give them a humble pie lest their rise to power brought about another era of suppression upon the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>The members of the Holy Valley revealed awkward smiles upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. They weren&rsquo;t certain how they should respond to those words. They didn&rsquo;t want to appear intimidated, but the fact was that they feared the person behind Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for the apology banquet. Let&rsquo;s head directly to the Holy Light Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Alright, we&rsquo;ll abide by young hero Chu Feng&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei and the others replied.<br></p></div>
