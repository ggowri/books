        <div> - Pigheaded<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the moment when the power emitted by Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation was about to reach Lu Jie, the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation beneath Lu Jie suddenly opened its eyes. Then, it opened its mouth.<br>Once its mouth opened, the entire Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation underwent a transformation. It was like the awakening of a dormant beast.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh---&rdquo;<br>In an instant, boundless suction power was released from its mouth.<br>The suction was so powerful that winds and clouds rushed toward it.<br>Even the five devastating elemental powers were all sucked into the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation&rsquo;s mouth.<br>At the same time, its sculpture-like body began to change. Both its flesh and body were undergoing a transformation.<br>The five elemental powers of wind, lightning, water, fire and earth were surging in its body and transforming the color of its skin.<br>Earlier, the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation had resembled a sculpture. However, at that moment it had transformed into a living beast.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>But the others were not too surprised by this.<br>After all, that was what was mighty about the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation.<br>No matter what sort of attack it received, they would all be devoured by it. Unless it was attacked by a power much stronger than itself, it was simply impossible to destroy the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation, as all attacks would be devoured.<br>That was also the reason why Lu Jie wasn't worried about being attacked whilst standing atop the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation.<br>As long as the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation existed, no attacks would be able to reach him.<br>That said, Chu Feng did not give up. Instead, he continued urging his grand slaughtering formation to release the five elements to attack Lu Jie nonstop.<br>It was so much so that, when compared to earlier, the might of Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack was even stronger.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng was also controlling the elemental energies themselves, and making them attack Lu Jie from all directions.<br>Unfortunately, it was all useless. No matter which direction Chu Feng attacked Lu Jie from, no matter how much stronger his attacks became, they would all be engulfed by the suction of the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation the moment they approached it. Following the suction, they would then be devoured by the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng did not give up, Lu jie became even more pleased with himself, and burst into laughter. &ldquo;Go ahead and continue. This is far from sufficient.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should put forth more strength. Best put in even the effort you use to suck milk.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice transmission entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you should stop.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation is extremely powerful. Not only is it able to devour your attacks, but it will also accumulate the power of your attacks within itself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All of your attacks have been stored within it. Once the time comes, it will release the power of your attacks back toward you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The more you strengthen the power of your attacks, the more dangerous it will become for you later.&rdquo;<br>It was Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen had discovered that Chu Feng still hadn't realized the powerful aspect of the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation. Fearing for Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety, he warned Chu Feng through voice transmission.<br>But, Chu Feng acted as if he hadn&rsquo;t heard Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s voice transmission, and continued to stubbornly attack Lu Jie.<br>As this continued, the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation not only had its flesh change color, even its aura and size had grown much more powerful.<br>&ldquo;Oh no! The Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation is using Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks to store up power within itself. That power is simply too strong. If it is to be released all at once, Chu Feng won't be able to contend against it at all.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, the crowd all felt that Chu Feng was doomed.<br>As for Lu Jie, he was pleased to the extreme.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, if you concede now, I can spare your life,&rdquo; he said to Chu Feng.<br>He knew very well that the power accumulated within the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation would be enough to take Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.<br>Of course, he also knew that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to kill Chu Feng.<br>After all, there were so many experts present.<br>Ignoring Grandmaster Tang Chen, who seemed to know Chu Feng, that Old Man Compliance also seemed to have a favorable impression of him.<br>Thus, Lu Jie felt that even if he used the accumulated power within the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation to attack Chu Feng, power sufficient to kill Chu Feng, his attack would still be blocked.<br>Else, he wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered with speaking superfluous words to Chu Feng. Instead, he would&rsquo;ve killed him directly.<br>That said, Lu Jie was very intelligent. Knowing full well that he would not be able to kill Chu Feng, he decided to use the opportunity to humiliate him.<br>What if Chu Feng really ended up conceding and begging for forgiveness?<br>If that were to happen, no one would question his might again.<br>From that point onward, he, Lu Jie, would remain the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s strongest world spiritist of the younger generation.<br>No one would question his status.<br>&ldquo;If you are to concede now, I am indeed able to spare your life,&rdquo; Chu Feng said indifferently.<br>Hearing those words, not only was Lu Jie shocked, but the bystanders were also stunned.<br>What was happening?<br>Could it be that even at that moment, Chu Feng still hadn&rsquo;t realized how bad the situation was for him?<br>Could it be that he still hadn&rsquo;t realized that Lu Jie&rsquo;s spirit formation had accumulated sufficient power to obliterate him?<br>&ldquo;Still not willing to admit defeat? If you still don&rsquo;t concede, I will release my attack,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Lu Jie.<br>&ldquo;Reckless fool. Since you want to die so much, I will fulfill your wish&rdquo;<br>As Lu Jie spoke, he began forming hand seals. Then, the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation began transforming.<br>The Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation still had its mouth open. It was still devouring Chu Feng&rsquo;s nonstop elemental attacks.<br>But, its sculpture-like body had began to move.<br>The sculpture opened its two giant hands. Light flickered dazzlingly on its two arms.<br>Everyone realized that the accumulated power would be sent forth through the hands.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I will give you one final chance. Are you going to admit defeat now, or are you planning to accept my judgement?&rdquo; Lu Jie asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I will also give you one last chance. Admit defeat now, and I will spare you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you insist on forcing my hand, I guarantee that you will regret it,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Even though Chu Feng was clearly facing a calamity, he still dared to say such a thing.<br>This truly infuriated Lu Jie. He was determined to teach Chu Feng a lesson.<br>&ldquo;Arrogant fool! Since you&rsquo;re incapable of differentiating good from bad, I will give you what you want!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom---&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Lu Jie attacked.<br>Under his control, the sculpture beneath him released boundless power from its hands.<br>That power was composed of the five elements of wind, lightning, water, fire and earth.<br>But, that power was being released from the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation. Furthermore, it was over a hundred times more powerful than the five elemental energies that had been released by Chu Feng.<br>The five elemental energies that were still being emitted by Chu Feng&rsquo;s slaughtering formation were immediately engulfed by Lu Jie&rsquo;s attack on contact. It was like a river colliding with the ocean.<br>That was the power that the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation had accumulated.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;<br>Many people felt the outcome of the match to be determined upon seeing this sight.<br>Even though Chu Feng had won their first confrontation, he was undoubtedly going to be defeated in their second confrontation.<br>The showdown between Chu Feng and Lu Jie was going to end in a tie.<br>But, Chu Feng would not be able to receive the incoming attack.<br>If he was rescued by others, it would mean that he had lost.<br>If he failed to block it himself, there wouldn&rsquo;t be another match.<br>It would mean Chu Feng was the one that had been defeated.<br>As such, the crowd felt that the showdown had come to an end.<br>&ldquo;Truly a pigheaded fellow.&rdquo;<br>However, seeing the terrifying power that covered the entire sky and was sweeping toward him, Chu Feng smiled and shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh---&rdquo;<br>Then, his hand seals began changing. After making successive hand seals, he pointed at Lu Jie.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Could it be?!&rdquo;<br>In the following instant, the crowd&rsquo;s complexions all changed.<br>The terrifying power that had been shot forth from the Spirit Beast Heaven-devouring Formation had actually turned around to attack Lu Jie.<br></p></div>
