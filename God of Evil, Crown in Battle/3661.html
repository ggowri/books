        <div> - Shattered Pride<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;How could this be? Could it be that Chu Feng also possesses a treasure capable of increasing his cultivation by a level at the Exalted Realm like the Scarletflame Soularmor?&rdquo;<br>Upon sensing Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura, the expressions of many people of the younger generation changed. This was especially true for those younger generations from the All-heaven Starfield. They had looks on their faces like they&rsquo;d been fed dog feces, and were completely speechless.<br>They no longer knew what to say. They felt their faces burning, and their hearts enormously stifled and on the verge of exploding.<br>Earlier, they were shouting that Chu Feng had an unfair advantage in the match. However, they now realized that Chu Feng had held back the entire fight.<br>This made them feel extremely embarrassed.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. Beiyang Luo, why aren&rsquo;t you all saying anything now? Did you all really think that only your Nangong Yifan possessed a treasure capable of increasing his cultivation, and my brother Chu Feng did not?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you now realize that it&rsquo;s not that my brother Chu Feng does not possess such a treasure, it&rsquo;s merely that he felt it beneath him to use it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s different from your Nangong Yifan, who would immediately decide to swallow forbidden medicine just because his battle power is inferior to his opponent's, and then make the excuse that he's taking a forbidden medicine because he&rsquo;s not using his Scarletflame Soularmor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. Hilarious, this is truly hilarious. What sort of excuse do you all have now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Nangong Yifan was unable to defeat my brother Chu Feng even after taking forbidden medicine. Do you dare to continue to say that my brother Chu Feng had an unfair advantage?&rdquo;<br>Kong Tianhui was simply overjoyed. Although he was very young, his face was filled with wrinkles from how deeply he was smiling.<br>He was not the only one feeling joyous. Kong Ci, Long Ning, Xian Yun, Wuming Yuanzhi, Wuming Xiongmo and the other younger generations were also overjoyed.<br>Earlier, they were being criticized by the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations the entire time. They were saying that the only reason why Chu Feng was able to win was because Nangong Yifan was unable to use the power of his Scarletflame Soularmor. Because of that, they felt rather awkward and embarrassed.<br>After all, it was a very good excuse&hellip;<br>However, they had come to discover that Chu Feng actually also possessed a treasure capable of increasing his cultivation by a level.<br>With that, no one would dare say that he had held an unfair advantage again. Nangong Yifan had been thoroughly defeated. No excuse would be able to save him.<br>Even if Chu Feng and Nangong Yifan were to fight again a hundred times, the result would still be the same.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng did not use any treasure,&rdquo; Lord Shoujian said all of a sudden.<br>&ldquo;Not a treasure?&rdquo; The crowd were all surprised to hear that.<br>&ldquo;Sense carefully. Young friend Chu Feng has only increased his cultivation by two levels,&rdquo; said Lord Shoujian.<br>The crowd immediately started to sense Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura. Upon doing so&hellip; they discovered that it was really as Lord Shoujian had said. There were only two sorts of power present on Chu Feng helping him increase his cultivation.<br>&ldquo;Could it be, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t use any treasure at all?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead, his actual cultivation is simply not that of a rank two Exalted, but rather a rank three Exalted?&rdquo;<br>The crowd all turned their gazes to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Lord Shoujian truly has keen eyesight.&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled as he said to Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t stop concealing it, this old man would not have been able to discover it either. Saint-cloak World Spiritists are truly extraordinary. Your ability to conceal is truly amazing,&rdquo; praised Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;Amazing! Chu Feng&rsquo;s actual cultivation is rank three Exalted?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that he simply hadn't gone all-out in the match for the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he had gone all-out, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that not even Linghu Hongfei would be a match for him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, Linghu Hongfei and Nangong Yifan are rivals. Their strengths must be on par with each other, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When Nangong Yifan is no match for Chu Feng, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that Linghu Hongfei would likely not be a match for Chu Feng either?&rdquo;<br>The crowd became even more excited. As they looked at Chu Feng, the looks of admiration in their eyes grew even more concentrated.<br>Even the saintesses Kong Ci and Long Ning were looking at Chu Feng with a special change in their expressions.<br>If Chu Feng could defeat Linghu Hongfei, it would naturally make him the strongest genius of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>At that moment, the younger generations of the Ancestral Martial Starfield were endlessly excited.<br>As for the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations, they were completely quiet. Originally, they were criticizing Chu Feng for having an unfair advantage. It was only at that moment that they realized that Chu Feng was actually going easy on Nangong Yifan.<br>Thus, even though they felt very unwilling, they had no choice but to accept the defeat.<br>It was not only them. Even Nangong Yifan himself was very depressed.<br>Being defeated was not scary. What was scary was being defeated so thoroughly.<br>This was even more so when he was so thoroughly defeated in public, and before the woman he fancied.<br>Nangong Yifan was most definitely someone with a very strong mindset. Even though he had an irritable temper, he was not someone who was easily thwarted by others.<br>However, without a doubt, he had been thwarted. In fact, he looked even more depressed than Wuming Yuanzhi, Kong Ci and the others had looked when they had been defeated by him earlier.<br>Everyone knew that Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s pride had been shattered like Wuming Yuanzhi and the others.<br>The only difference was that Wuming Yuanzhi and the others&rsquo; pride was shattered by Nangong Yifan, whereas Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s pride was shattered by Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations arrived before Chu Feng and surrounded him completely.<br>They were originally being completely suppressed by the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>It was Chu Feng who had reversed the situation repeatedly, and allowed them to ruthlessly beat down the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>Thus, Chu Feng was currently akin to a hero in their eyes. They were all filled with adoration and respect for him.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, how did you become this amazing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How were you able to defeat a rank nine Immortal Technique using an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill? Furthermore, it&rsquo;s the Dark Ghostflame, an extremely powerful rank nine Immortal Technique. Exactly how powerful is your understanding of martial skills?&rdquo; Kong Tianhui asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, tell me the truth. Are you not human? Humans couldn&rsquo;t possibly accomplish what you&rsquo;ve accomplished.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve mastered the strongest Immortal Taboo Martial Skill from our Divine Body Royal City. However, it&rsquo;s very difficult to handle rank five Immortal Techniques with it, and it's simply unable to contend against rank six Immortal Techniques. Thus, how were you able to use an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill to defeat a rank nine Immortal Technique?&rdquo;<br>Kong Ci looked at Chu Feng with a serious expression. She seemed to really want to know the answer.<br>&ldquo;Actually, it&rsquo;s not that no one has accomplished such a thing before. This old man was fortunate enough to witness a youngster using an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill to defeat a rank nine Immortal Technique in the past,&rdquo; at that moment, even Lord Shoujian had walked over.<br>&ldquo;Lord Shoujian, who was it?&rdquo; asked Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;Speaking of it, that person is someone greatly related to young friend Chu Feng,&rdquo; Lord Shoujian did not directly answer. Instead, he looked at Chu Feng with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Lord Shoujian, you must be talking about my father, right?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>When Chu Feng had first entered the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, he did not even know what Immortal Techniques were. It was a senior that had told him about the difference between Immortal Techniques and Immortal Taboo Martial Skills. From that same senior, Chu Feng learned that his father Chu Xuanyuan had managed to defeat a rank nine Immortal Technique using an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill.<br>The only difference was the senior that mentioned that to Chu Feng had no idea Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son.<br>However, Lord Shoujian knew of their relationship.<br>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; Lord Shoujian nodded at Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>The person that he was talking about was indeed Chu Feng&rsquo;s father, Chu Xuanyuan.<br></p></div>
