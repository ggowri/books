        <div>: Is He Really Worthy?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some of the blue birds managed to escape through the tattered barrier, and they immediately launched their attacks on the cultivators.<br>These birds were mostly at Utmost Exalted level, which didn&rsquo;t pose a threat to Chu Feng and the others, but to the other cultivators, they were no different from the grim reaper. Even those who had fled in advance, due to the limitation of their cultivation, ended up getting torn into shreds.<br>Cries of agony filled the earth.<br>Meanwhile, at the top of the barrier, Chu Feng noticed that even though the light pillars would disappear after some time, they left giant pits on the ground. Those pits appeared to be entrances to the demon coffin. They were shrouded in the blue-violet gaseous flames, but they appeared to form a formation.<br>After some time, Chu Feng and the others finally found a chance to slip into the barrier.<br>&ldquo;The gaseous flame has started dissipating.&rdquo;<br>Now that they were much closer to the humongous pillar of gaseous flame, they realized that it wasn&rsquo;t spurting outward anymore. What they were seeing right now was just the remaining gaseous flame that had poured out earlier. It was just a matter of time before it dissipated.<br>&ldquo;The gaseous flame is nothing more than a signal to lure others here. Once the entrance appears, the gaseous flame will stop pouring out,&rdquo; Tao Wu said.<br>&ldquo;Are these pits really the entrance to the demon coffin?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;They are entrances, but not the one to the demon coffin. The real entrance to the demon coffin has yet to appear,&rdquo; Tao Wu replied.<br>&ldquo;Then where do these pits lead to?&rdquo; Old Cat asked.<br>Tao Wu ignored Old Cat and instead turned to Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, take a closer look at the pits. Can you tell the differences among them?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t notice any differences among the pits earlier. Upon hearing Tao Wu&rsquo;s words, he activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes and began carefully examining the pits.<br>Tao Wu stared intently at Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes as he activated Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, and a hint of shock flashed across his eyes as he realized something. He looked like he was going to say something for a moment, but he eventually decided to hold his tongue.<br>&ldquo;There are many entrances here, but they can be placed into two categories. One allows all cultivators to freely enter and leave without any restrictions whereas the other can only be accessed by juniors,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Tao Wu replied.<br>&ldquo;The formations on those pits are rather unusual. I can tell that they are made out of spirit power, but why do they manifest as the blue-violet gaseous flame? Furthermore, the spirit power is so thin that I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to tell that it is spirit power if I didn&rsquo;t take a close look at it.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t able to tell earlier, but he was certain now that the blue-violet gaseous flame was spirit power. Even those massive blue birds were manifested out of spirit power.<br>&ldquo;The person who constructed this place is an amazing world spiritist who can freely alter the trait of his spirit power. What&rsquo;s important here is that all of these entrances only lead to two places. One is accessible to all cultivators whereas the other can only be reached by juniors. The real entrance to the demon coffin will only appear once the fortuitous encounters in those two places have been claimed,&rdquo; Tao Wu said.<br>&ldquo;What are the fortuitous encounters here?&rdquo; Chu Feng and Old Cat asked at the same time.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have an answer to that question. I&rsquo;d say that everything that is happening right now is a trial. This is a common tactic used by those who are looking for a successor to their legacy. Only those who have cleared the trial will be able to obtain the true treasure lying here.<br>&ldquo;Young brother Chu Feng, the three of us should split ways here. Old Cat and I will enter the place that is accessible to everyone whereas you&rsquo;ll explore the one that&rsquo;s only accessible to juniors,&rdquo; Tao Wu said.<br>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>However, Old Cat revealed a skeptical smile at that arrangement.<br>&ldquo;You knew from the start that there are two entrances here, and one can only be accessed by juniors. Is that the reason you insisted on working with us?&rdquo; Old Cat asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Doesn&rsquo;t that prove my capability then?&rdquo; Tao Wu replied.<br>Old Cat couldn&rsquo;t refute that. It initially thought that Tao Wu was nothing more than a braggart, but everything that had happened thus far proved that he did know what was going on.<br>&ldquo;Young brother Chu Feng, do you see that place? Let&rsquo;s meet there once we&rsquo;re done. If you clear the trial ahead of us, you can wait for us there,&rdquo; Tao Wu pointed to a location as he spoke.<br>While the location was rather far away, both Chu Feng and Old Cat could still see where he was pointing. Indeed, the spot was one of the safer places here.<br>&ldquo;Elder and Old Cat, I&rsquo;ll get going first.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng randomly chose one of the entrances that were accessible only to the juniors and entered it.<br>According to Tao Wu, it didn&rsquo;t matter which entrance one chose since all of them led to the same destination.<br>Tao Wu also started making his move, but he suddenly stopped and turned to look at Old Cat.<br>&ldquo;Old Kitty, why are you following me? Are you asking to be killed?&rdquo;<br>Tao Wu realized that Old Cat was following him.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of death, but since we&rsquo;re in an alliance&hellip; it&rsquo;s only right for us to travel together, right?&rdquo; Old Cat replied merrily.<br>&ldquo;You really aren&rsquo;t afraid of death. You should know that I&rsquo;m only tolerating your presence on young brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s account. Now that he&rsquo;s no longer here, I have no qualms crushing you like an insect.&rdquo;<br>A vile smile crept onto Tao Wu&rsquo;s black face. He wasn&rsquo;t emanating any killing intent at all, but it sent a shudder down Old Cat&rsquo;s spine. Its fur stood on end.<br>&ldquo;Forget it. We&rsquo;ll move separately then,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>It quickly turned around and fled.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing more than a cat. No matter how it tries to act tough, it&rsquo;s unable to shake off its wary and cowardly nature,&rdquo; Tao Wu sneered.<br>His remark indicated that he was just planning to scare Old Cat a little. Otherwise, there was no way the latter could have escaped from him considering the gap in their strength.<br>However, Tao Wu didn&rsquo;t make a move right away. Instead, he headed toward the entrance Chu Feng had entered to take a look.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s decent compared to the other juniors here, but in the scope of the vast world of cultivation, he&rsquo;s only so-so. Is he&hellip; really worthy?&rdquo; Tao Wu murmured with deep eyes.<br>No one could tell what he was thinking.<br></p></div>
