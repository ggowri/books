        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Chu Feng felt a surge of warmth in his heart.</span><br><span>His relationship with Long Chengyu was different from that with Long Muxi. He hadn&rsquo;t known Long Muxi for a long time, but they had fought beside each other and braved death together. They naturally became close to each other.</span><br><span>On the other hand, Chu Feng knew Long Chengyu for an even shorter period of time, and the experiences they had together weren&rsquo;t considerable. While he had saved Long Chengyu from danger once, it wasn&rsquo;t uncommon for people of the latter&rsquo;s stature to shrug off such goodwill. There were even some who saw it as a stain to their record and resolved to kill their benefactor so that word wouldn&rsquo;t spread.</span><br><span>But that was not what Long Chengyu did. He sincerely treated Chu Feng as a friend and sided with him, even at the expense of turning against his clan.</span><br><span>While Chu Feng&rsquo;s relationship with Long Muxi probably played a part in that too, there was truly no reason for Long Chengyu to go that far for him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I have indeed caused trouble for you. I&rsquo;m willing to take any punishment as long as it&rsquo;s not too overboard,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>That was the kind of person he was. He naturally showed goodwill and respect to anyone who did the same too, though the opposite was true too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What are you saying? No one will lay a finger on you as long as I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; Long Chengyu promised, though he could tell that Chu Feng meant what he said.</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clan had expended a lot of resources to prepare for this opening of the Armory Hall, and this incident would indubitably slow the development of their juniors. That was also the reason Chu Feng felt apologetic to Long Chengyu and Long Muxi.</span><br><span>Chu Feng, Long Chengyu, and Long Muxi made their way to the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s side palace.</span><br><span>Not too far away from it was the main palace, where Long Xu and the upper echelons of the Totem Dragon Clan were discussing the incident that had transpired earlier in the Armory Hall.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you should think of a way to escape. I suspect things aren&rsquo;t going in your favor,&rdquo; Eggy said worriedly.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Long Chengyu has already guaranteed my safety. It&rsquo;d be rude of me to escape now. Let&rsquo;s just wait and take a look first. If the Totem Dragon Clan thinks that I should be punished, as long as it&rsquo;s something reasonable, I&rsquo;ll accept it on Long Chengyu and Long Muxi&rsquo;s accounts.</span><br><span>&ldquo;If they choose to push their boundaries, so be it. I still have my father&rsquo;s protective formation. They&rsquo;ll only be courting their own doom. I do feel apologetic to Long Chengyu and Long Muxi because I have brought losses to the Totem Dragon Clan, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;ll allow them to trample over me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What do you think they&rsquo;ll do?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>She was worried since the Totem Dragon Clan was beyond Chu Feng&rsquo;s current means to deal with.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to say. If they are short-sighted, they&rsquo;ll blame this matter on me and mete out severe punishments to uphold their authority. If they are wise, they will mete out a customary punishment so as to be accountable to the other clansmen who don't know what happened back there,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Which category do you think the upper echelons of the Totem Dragon Clan belong to?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say since I&rsquo;ve never met them. I hope they are in the latter category though,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>The three of them waited in the side palace for the verdict from the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s upper echelon. Even though Chu Feng and Long Chengyu were having a pleasant conversation, he could still sense that the latter was worried about this matter.</span><br><span>It was one thing for the young prodigies of the Totem Dragon Clan to miss out on this precious opportunity to tame a God Armament, but their clan protection formation had been shaken as well. This was a huge matter to the Totem Dragon Clan.</span><br><span>Finally, a messenger entered the side palace and informed them that Lord Long Xu had invited the three of them to head to the main palace.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Rest assured, Chu Feng. I was the one who brought you here. I&rsquo;ll make sure that you </span><span>leave this place safe and sound,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>His voice lacked confidence, but in its place was conviction. He saw it as his responsibility to protect Chu Feng even though he wasn&rsquo;t sure if he had the power to do so.</span><br><span>Long Muxi didn&rsquo;t say a word, but she shared the same gaze as Long Chengyu.</span><br><span>Chu Feng looked at the two of them and smiled. Without saying any extraneous words, he got up and headed out.</span><br><span>Soon, the three of them arrived at the main palace.</span><br><span>There were only three people inside the main palace: Long Xu, Long Suqing, and Long Kuitian. However, the auras lingering inside the palace indicated that there were far more people inside the main palace earlier on, just that they had already left.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Long Xu, I have learned about the happenings in the Armory Hall, but it&rsquo;d be ridiculous to blame Chu Feng for being outstanding. The same goes for the weakening of our clan protection formation&hellip;&rdquo; Long Chengyu immediately spoke up to plead on Chu Feng&rsquo;s behalf.</span><br><span>However, Long Xu chuckled and asked, &ldquo;Who said that young friend Chu Feng is at fault here?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Both Long Muxi and Long Chengyu were taken aback.</span><br><span>Long Xu rose to his feet and walked up to Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I am Long Xu, one of the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Nine Flags Dragon Warriors. First, I&rsquo;d like to clarify that the formation in the Armory Hall was from our predecessors. It&rsquo;s not our intention to make things difficult for you. Our clan is apologetic for the distress you have faced, and we would like to offer you this item to you as compensation.&rdquo;</span><br><span>With a wave of Long Xu&rsquo;s palm, a golden spear appeared before Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was stunned. He had previously seen the golden spear in the Armory Hall. It was a God Armament.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, are you giving this to me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, someone of your caliber should have obtained a God Armament in the Armory Hall. It was unfortunate that a mishap happened. This weapon over here is the Golden Wings Fire God Spear. It is one of the better GodArmaments of our clan. I hope that you can accept this weapon.&rdquo; Long Xu handed the Golden Wings Fire God Spear to Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one more matter I&rsquo;d like to tell you. The Silver Dragon Spear is a special existence in our Totem Dragon Clan that has commanding power over the other God Armaments due to a formation left behind by our clan chief. Before the Silver Dragon Spear was sealed off, it imposed a restriction on all of the untamed God Armaments in the Totem Dragon Clan, strictly disallowing them to acknowledge you as their master. This restriction is specifically targeted only toward you.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Since we have decided to gift the Golden Wings Fire God Spear to you, you are free to trade it for another God Armament. If you find that a hassle, we can also prepare another normal GodArmament that you can tame, though it&rsquo;ll take some time,&rdquo; Long Xu said.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu was flabbergasted. He hadn&rsquo;t expected the upper echelons of the </span><span>Totem Dragon Clan to come to this conclusion after their discussion.</span><br><span>Both Long Kuitian and Long Suqing glanced at each other and smiled. They still remembered how intense the arguments among the upper echelons as to whether they should befriend or punish Chu Feng were.</span><br><span>There were many elders who wanted to have Chu Feng punished. By the nature of their position, they naturally prioritized the clan interest above all things, so they couldn&rsquo;t tolerate the fact that an outsider had shaken up their core.</span><br><span>It was only fortunate that a highly influential person had sided with them by insisting on befriending Chu Feng. If not for him, there would have never been such a harmonious outcome. That person was none other than Long Xu.</span></p></div>
