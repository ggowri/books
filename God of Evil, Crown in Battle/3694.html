        <h1>Chapter 3693</h1>
        <div> - The Killer&rsquo;s Weakness<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Is your father really not here anymore?&rdquo; asked Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I feel that my father has not died,&rdquo; Chu Feng said what he truly felt.<br>Chu Feng felt that he did not have to conceal anything from her.<br>&ldquo;I got it then.&rdquo;<br>Gu Mingyuan did not ask anything more after hearing those words. However, she revealed a smile of relief on her face.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell that Gu Mingyuan might not know his father very well. However, their relationship should be pretty decent.<br>At least, she was worried about his father&rsquo;s well-being.<br>Then, together with Chu Lingxi and Gu Mingyuan, Chu Feng arrived at the place where the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s members were being interrogated.<br>When they arrived at the interrogation site, they discovered that Chu Xuanzhengfa and the experts of the Law Enforcement Hall, the experts of interrogation, were actually at their wits&rsquo; end.<br>Interrogation was nothing more than torturing someone to force them to reveal what one wanted to know.<br>Although the nine experts from the Blood-devouring Hall were all very powerful, they were chained by Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s special chains. Thus, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others&rsquo; interrogation methods were useful against them.<br>Unfortunately, although the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master and eight experts were all evildoers, they were extremely tough and unyielding.<br>No matter what sort of methods Chu Xuanzhengfa used, they were unwilling to utter a word.<br>Seeing this, it appeared that they would be unwilling to speak of who the mastermind was even in death.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Lingxi, what brought you two here?&rdquo;<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa was rather surprised to see Chu Feng and the others.<br>Evidently, he did not wish for Chu Feng, Chu Lingxi and especially Gu Mingyuan to see his powerless appearance.<br>However, Gu Mingyuan did not care about what Chu Xuanzhengfa was thinking. She directly entered the interrogation site and waved her hand. &ldquo;All of you can leave.&rdquo;<br>Her tone was as ice-cold as before. She looked like a completely different person than when she was talking with Chu Feng.<br>When she was talking with Chu Feng, she was like an amiable and gentle senior.<br>However, she now appeared extremely arrogant and cold, like a ruthless queen.<br>Although she was not from the Chu Heavenly Clan, not even Chu Xuanzhengfa dared to neglect her. As for the others, it was even more so.<br>Thus, Chu Xuanzhengfa did not even bother to ask anything, and directly led all of the people from the Law Enforcement Hall out of the interrogation site.<br>He handed over the hall that they used for interrogation to Gu Mingyuan.<br>With this, apart from the imprisoned experts of the Blood-devouring Hall, only Chu Feng, Chu Lingxi and Gu Mingyuan remained in the dark and moist interrogation hall.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that you scum would actually possess occupational professionalism.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your mouths are quite tightly sealed,&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan spoke with an extremely mocking tone.<br>&ldquo;Heh, what sort of torture are you planning to use on this old man?&rdquo; the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master asked.<br>&ldquo;Torture? It&rsquo;s extremely boring to torture you,&rdquo; said Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;If you want to torture them, this old man would not care in the slightest,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;I naturally knew that you would not care if I tortured them. However, what if I am to torture your grandson?&rdquo; asked Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;Grandson? That&rsquo;s but a rumor. You actually believe in such a rumor?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I might as well tell you the truth. It is this old man who spread that rumor. I did that precisely because I wanted to baffle scum like you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man doesn&rsquo;t even have a son, how could I have a grandson?&rdquo;<br>The Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master laughed and shook his head. He had an extremely mocking look on his face.<br>It was as if Gu Mingyuan mentioning his grandson was truly ridiculous.<br>&ldquo;If that were truly a rumor that you spread out to baffle others, wouldn't it be even better that you managed to deceive me with it? Why bother explaining it to me here?&rdquo; said Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;Truth be told, since I&rsquo;ve fallen in your hands, I&rsquo;ve never thought about being able to live. Because of that, I didn&rsquo;t want you to waste your time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Gu Mingyuan, you can be considered to be a top individual in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. To be able to die by your hands, my death is worth it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about you allow this old man a delightful death?&rdquo; asked the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;You wish to die? That&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tell me who it was that ordered you to attack the Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; said Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t ordered by anyone. This old man has a personal grievance against Chu Xuanyuan,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Do you think that I&rsquo;m easily deceived?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let me tell you this. It&rsquo;s fine that you wish to die.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you will only be allowed to die after you reveal who the mastermind is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Before that, you will not be allowed to die. Just you wait, I&rsquo;ll go and personally bring over that grandson of yours,&rdquo; said Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. Never would I have imagined Gu MIngyuan to be this foolish. You&rsquo;re actually going to waste your time on a mere rumor?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you want to waste your time, go ahead and do that.&rdquo;<br>The Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master burst into loud laughter. His laughter was filled with mockery.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo; However, right at that moment, Gu Mingyuan also burst into sudden laughter. Her laughter was even louder than the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s laughter.<br>&ldquo;Stay alive. Don&rsquo;t think about killing yourself. If you die on me, I guarantee that your grandson will suffer more than you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Lingxi, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; After saying those words, Gu Mingyuan left with Chu Feng and Chu Lingxi.<br>Although Chu Feng was no longer looking at the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, he, with his world spirit techniques, was able to see his expression even with his back to him.<br>A trace of panic flashed past the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s face.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng concluded that what Gu Mingyuan said might be true. The Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master might really have a grandson.<br>As for that grandson, it was clearly the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s weakness.<br>Even though he had tried his hardest to conceal it, it was still discovered by Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
