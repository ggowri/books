        <div> - To Fish A Needle From The Sea<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s former Clan Chief did not refuse because he disliked Zi Xunyi.<br>Instead, it was because the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s bloodline could not be allowed to become impure. Because of that, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen were only allowed to integrate with fellow Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen.<br>This was especially true for his son. He had been nurtured as the successor to the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan from the very beginning.<br>As such, he would naturally not permit his son to be with a human. As such, he would not allow his son to be with Zi Xunyi.<br>Even though he was very fond of Zi Xunyi and had nurtured her as his own daughter, he still would not allow such a thing to happen.<br>Because of that, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s current Clan Chief concealed his love for Zi Xunyi in the depths of his heart.<br>However, it was actually an open secret that everyone knew about. Even the wife of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief knew that her husband was actually deeply in love with Zi Xunyi.<br>In fact, Zi Xunyi was the only woman that the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief truly loved.<br>However, due to his father&rsquo;s prohibition, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had been unable to marry Zi Xunyi the entire time.<br>&ldquo;In that case, why would the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief be marrying Zi Xunyi now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because his father just passed away not long ago. Furthermore, rumor has it that the former Clan Chief finally agreed to have him marry Zi Xunyi before his death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, not long after the funeral for the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s former Clan Chief was held, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, who had been impatient to marry Zi Xunyi the entire time, immediately started to make preparations for this marriage ceremony. As for us, we have arrived at quite a coincidental time&hellip; we actually managed to come right at the time of the marriage ceremony,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right, exactly who asked you to come find Zi Xunyi? According to my knowledge, it seems that Zi Xunyi has never left this Demon Elimination Cave,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er asked curiously.<br>She already knew that Chu Feng had come here not because of himself, but rather because someone asked him to find Zi Xunyi.<br>&ldquo;Since you know Zi Xunyi, you must also know Ying Mingchao, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I have naturally heard of Ying Mingchao. He was the Hero City&rsquo;s City Master, the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm&rsquo;s strongest genius a thousand years ago. He was the person with the greatest opportunity to rule over the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, didn&rsquo;t that Ying Mingchao die already?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He was too impatient to rule over the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, he needed to eliminate the Kong and Zhou Heavenly Clans first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, he was overly conceited, and tried to eliminate the two Heavenly Clans by himself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the end, due to his conceit, he suffered a miserable defeat and was eliminated by the joint efforts of the Kong and Zhou Heavenly Clans.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not long after Ying Mingchao died, the Kong and Zhou Heavenly Clan jointly attacked and eliminated his Hero City too,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;Do you think that is the truth?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I do not know whether or not that is true. After all, it is merely a rumor. That said, why are you asking about Ying Mingchao?&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er asked curiously.<br>Li Yue&rsquo;er was not a talkative person. However, it seemed like she was very interested about others&rsquo; business.<br>Otherwise, she would not know so much about the story of Ying Mingchao.<br>&ldquo;The person who asked me to find Zi Xunyi was Ying Mingchao,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Ying Mingchao? He&rsquo;s still alive?&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er was very surprised. She said, &ldquo;He is someone capable of moving the winds and clouds in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since he&rsquo;s alive, what sort of situation is he in? Was he imprisoned, or was his cultivation crippled? Why did he not not reveal himself to take revenge even though he was alive?&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er asked curiously.<br>She was very smart. She knew that there must be a reason for Ying Mingchao to not reveal himself and take revenge when he was still alive.<br>&ldquo;He is currently trapped in the Kong Heavenly Clan. Only Zi Xunyi is capable of saving him,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Are you certain? I&rsquo;ve never heard that Ying Mingchao had any sort of relationship with Zi Xunyi,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er said.<br><br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that they do not know one another?&rdquo; Chu Feng was very surprised.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of the two of them knowing one another,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er said in a determined manner.<br>Hearing what Li Yue&rsquo;er said, Eggy&rsquo;s expression changed. She said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, that Ying Mingchao couldn&rsquo;t possibly be deliberately lying to you so as to put you into danger, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason for him to lie to me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;If what Ying Mingchao said is true, then there is only one sort of explanation for that. That is, only Zi Xunyi and him knew about their relationship,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;No matter what, since we&rsquo;re already here, we cannot shrink back,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;If we are to leave now, we will still be able to make it,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er said to Chu Feng. She felt that Chu Feng might have been deceived.<br>At the very least, according to the information that she knew, there was no relationship between Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi.<br>She felt that it was simply nonsense, something absolutely impossible, for Yin Mingchao to ask for Zi Xunyi to save him.<br>Thus, instead of continuing to find to find Zi Xunyi, it was better to leave.<br>&ldquo;I must give it a try,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a grand formation in this place. My observation methods are ineffective here. What about yours?&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er asked.<br>Chu Feng shook his head. A very powerful spirit formation was placed around the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s headquarters. Even Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes were unable to see through the buildings here.<br>Li Yue&rsquo;er handed Chu Feng a communication talisman, and said, &ldquo;The Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formations have a time limit. If you insist on finding Zi Xunyi, the two of us must move quickly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Take this. If I am to find Zi Xunyi, I will notify you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to find Zi Xunyi, you can pinch this communication talisman and I will immediately withdraw from here.&rdquo;<br>Then, she entered the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s headquarters.<br>Chu Feng followed into the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s headquarters after her.<br>Since observation methods using world spirit techniques were useless, they could only use the fastest speed to search for Zi Xunyi throughout the entire Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s territory.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng must try to chat with Zi Xunyi regarding this matter before the wedding ceremony started.<br>Thus&hellip; this was a very difficult task.<br>Fortunately, both Chu Feng and Li Yue&rsquo;er were Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists. Thus, the time limit for the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation that they set up was much longer than the one that Chu Feng had set up with Wang Qiang in the Kong Heavenly Clan.<br>However, even with that being the case, the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation still had a time limit. Furthermore, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s headquarters was very big.<br><br>Thus, Chu Feng and Li Yu&rsquo;er searched carefully and rapidly.<br>&ldquo;This is too hard. This is simply trying to fish a needle from the sea.&rdquo; [1. Fish a needle from the sea is the chinese equivalent of finding a needle in a haystack.]<br>After searching for a while with no results, Her Lady Queen felt desperate.<br>What Her Lady Queen said was not false. The reason for that was because the entire Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s headquarters was covered with spirit formations.<br>Thus, it was not only Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, but his world spirit techniques and other observation methods were also all ineffective. He and Li Yue&rsquo;er must search through the buildings one by one in order to find Zi Xunyi.<br>However, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan possessed countless buildings. Furthermore, it was unknown whether or not they had forbidden areas.<br><br>Thus, it would truly be very difficult for them to find Zi Xunyi. It could even be said that the chances of them finding her were extremely slim.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, should we capture someone and interrogate them?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen suggested.<br>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve already used the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation. If I am to capture someone to interrogate them, I would easily expose myself,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;Then what are we to do? If we continue to search like this, it will be truly difficult to find Zi Xunyi,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s no other option, we will have to use the final resort,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;What final resort?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;If we cannot find Zi Xunyi, then we can only wait for her to show herself,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Are you really planning to do that? That would be truly dangerous,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s heart tightened upon hearing what Chu Feng said. She revealed a worried expression.<br>She understood what Chu Feng planned to do. Chu Feng did not plan to leave.<br>If they were truly unable to find Zi Xunyi, he planned to wait till the marriage ceremony officially started, wait till Zi Xunyi showed herself.<br><br>However, at that time, everyone from the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan would be present. Even the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would be present.<br>If Chu Feng were to reveal himself at that time, he would truly be stranding in confrontation with the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan. At that time, he would have no way of escape.<br><br>It would truly be a gamble with his life!!!<br><br>&ldquo;Regardless, I cannot journey here in vain. Even if it is a gamble, I must gamble this once,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;You stubborn fellow. I know for sure that my advice will be useless.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Right now, I only hope that girl Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s background is truly capable of scaring away the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan.&rdquo;<br><br>At that moment, Her Lady Queen did not have any hope for Chu Feng being able to find Zi Xunyi. The reason for that was because the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s headquarters was simply too large.<br>To find Zi Xunyi like this, and to find her before the marriage ceremony, was simply too difficult.<br>Unless they were extremely lucky, it would simply be impossible to find Zi Xunyi.<br>Thus, Her Lady Queen placed her hopes onto Li Yue&rsquo;er.<br><br>If Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s background was truly capable of scaring away the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan, then regardless of what sort of attitude Zi Xunyi might have, Chu Feng would be able to escape unscathed.<br><br>Otherwise, Her Lady Queen felt that everything would lead to disaster today.<br>After all, according to Li Yue&rsquo;er, there wasn&rsquo;t any relationship between Zi Xunyi and Ying Mingchao.<br><br>Thus, with the information they had at hand, it would appear that they had a higher chance of losing this gamble.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s him, it&rsquo;s this bastard that stole the wedding gift Lord Clan Chief had prepared for Lady Zi.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Beat this bastard to death. Dismember his body into ten thousand pieces! Skin him alive and pull out his tendons!&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Make him suffer a fate worse than death! Make him pay!&rdquo;<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>Suddenly, furious shouts could be heard nonstop.<br>The direction where the shouts were heard was the location where the wedding ceremony would be held.<br>Most importantly, upon hearing those shouts, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart tightened.<br><br>Stole from the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan?<br>Apart from Li Yue&rsquo;er, Chu Feng could not think of a second person who had done that.<br>Li Yue&rsquo;er had been captured?<br><br></p></div>
