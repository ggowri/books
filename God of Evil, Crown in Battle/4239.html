        <div> - Doesn&rsquo;t Care?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Lu Jie!&rdquo;<br>When they saw him, the expressions in the eyes of both the people of the younger generation and those of the older generation changed.<br>The reason for that was because that person was the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted&rsquo;s most highly regarded disciple, Lu Jie.<br>The crowd hadn't known that Lu Jie was there, but they felt that he must&rsquo;ve been there for some time now. Else, he wouldn&rsquo;t have appeared at such an opportune time.<br>The reason why the crowd had not discovered Lu Jie was because he had a concealing treasure on him. It was something that the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted had given him.<br>With that treasure on him, even the grand existences present would not be able to discover Lu Jie without him revealing himself.<br>Seeing Lu Jie, delight appeared in the hearts of the depressed Yue Yang and Chen Guang.<br>They felt hatred for Chu Feng, because he had defeated them. But, they lacked the strength to avenge themselves.<br>Lu Jie, however, was capable of avenging them. Lu Jie was the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s strongest world spiritist of the younger generation. He was someone that had comprehended rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation. They believed that he was most definitely capable of defeating Chu Feng..<br>&ldquo;Who defeated the two of you?&rdquo;<br>Although Lu Jie had revealed himself, he did not approach Yue Yang and Chen Guang. Instead, he questioned them from where he stood.<br>His expression was completely tranquil, and the tone of his words very calm. Nevertheless, the crowd were all able to tell that he was very interested in the person that had defeated Yue Yang and Chen Guang.<br>&ldquo;His name is Chu Feng,&rdquo; answered Yue Yang.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Lu Jie pondered for a bit, but was unable to think of anything related to a Chu Feng.<br>Although Lu Jie&rsquo;s senior sister, the All-seeing Heavenly Master, had her plans thwarted by Chu Feng, Lu Jie did not know about it. As such, this was the first time that he had heard the name Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Whose disciple is this Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Which power does he belong to?&rdquo; Lu Jie asked in succession.<br>&ldquo;Regarding that&hellip; we&rsquo;re not sure,&rdquo; said Yue Yang.<br>Right after Yue Yang finished saying those words, Chen Guang also spoke, &ldquo;Brother Lu Jie, that Chu Feng is extremely arrogant. He simply does not place us in his eyes at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Else, brother Chen Guang and I would not have challenged him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, we were no match for him, and brought disgrace on ourselves.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Lu Jie, I hope you can stand up for us and teach that Chu Feng a proper lesson.&rdquo;<br>Compared to Yue Yang&rsquo;s simple response, Chen Guang&rsquo;s words were extremely instigating.<br>&ldquo;Why must I stand up for the two of you?&rdquo;<br>To the crowd&rsquo;s surprise, Lu Jie responded to Chen Guang&rsquo;s request with extreme coldness.<br>This caused Chen Guang&rsquo;s complexion to turn ashen. He felt that he had been completely humiliated.<br>But, he was not too surprised by Lu Jie&rsquo;s response either. After all, this was the sort of personality that Lu Jie had.<br>Chen Guang calling Chu Feng arrogant was a story he had made up. Chu Feng had not displayed extreme arrogance.<br>But, compared to Chu Feng, Lu Jie was truly arrogant.<br>It could be said that, apart from his master the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, he did not place any other world spiritist in his eyes.<br>He would not even pay any attention to the experts of the older generation. Even when it came to his senior brothers and sisters, he would rarely show any respect toward them.<br>Lu Jie was a conceited individual.<br>He was conceited to the extreme, and was completely unreasonable.<br>&ldquo;Lu Jie, my disciple was calling this matter to your attention out of good will. Why must you respond so vulgarly?&rdquo; Chen Guang&rsquo;s master asked with a complaining tone.<br>As Chen Guang was his disciple, he was unable to tolerate his disciple receiving such treatment.<br>Even though Lu Jie was the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted&rsquo;s disciple, he still wouldn't allow it.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Lu Jie snorted at Chen Guang&rsquo;s master. He did not even bother to respond properly. Just like that, he turned around and prepared to leave.<br>This caused Chen Guang&rsquo;s master to have an extremely ugly expression.<br>Lu Jie was evidently not placing him in his eyes either.<br>But, in terms of seniority, he was clearly a senior to Lu Jie.<br>No matter how talented Lu Jie might be, he shouldn&rsquo;t act like that toward him. After all, Lu Jie&rsquo;s current strength could not compare to his at all.<br>Right at that moment, another old man&rsquo;s voice was heard, &ldquo;Lu Jie, could it be that you&rsquo;re afraid to enter?&rdquo;<br>The person who had spoken was Yue Yang&rsquo;s master.<br>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I dare?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Lu Jie stopped and turned around.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been to the Ancient Compliance Castle multiple times yourself. But you&rsquo;ve never managed to discover that Hidden Gate, whereas that Chu Feng discovered it, and even smoothly passed it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This means that his strength surpasses your own,&rdquo; said Yue Yang&rsquo;s master.<br>&ldquo;Trying to incite me into action?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Like the incompetent disciples, the masters are equally incompetent.&rdquo;<br>Lu Jie revealed a faint smile. He was not angered, and smiled very mockingly.<br>It turned out that he had already seen through Chen Guang and Yue Yang&rsquo;s desire to use him to avenge them.<br>&ldquo;Lu Jie, is this how you speak to your elders?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is this what your master taught you?&rdquo; Chen Guang and Yue Yang&rsquo;s masters asked with great displeasure.<br>As Lu Jie had publicly humiliated them, they, with their status, couldn&rsquo;t possibly not respond to his humiliations.<br>&ldquo;What my master taught me has nothing to do with you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But soon, my master will be arriving. If you have questions regarding his teachings, you can go ahead and ask him then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, I wonder, would you dare to do so?&rdquo; Lu Jie questioned with narrowed eyes.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chen Guang and Yue Yang&rsquo;s masters frowned. Extreme anger and displeasure raged in their hearts.<br>But, they were left speechless.<br>What Lu Jie had said was correct. They truly wouldn't dare to say much when faced with the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.<br>After all, he was someone that they did not dare to offend.<br>It was also the reason why Lu Jie dared to act so arrogantly towards them even though he was clearly a junior.<br>There was no need to doubt Lu Jie&rsquo;s talent. But, the person that the crowd was really afraid of was Lu Jie&rsquo;s master, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Brother Lu Jie, I am really calling it to your attention out of good will.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t enter, the name on that flag might no longer belong to you. It might instead change.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng will most definitely challenge the Talent Steps,&rdquo; said Chen Guang.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he truly has the ability to do so, he can have it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Lu Jie, do not care about something like that,&rdquo; Lu Jie said indifferently.<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>Both Yue Yang and Chen Guang were speechless after hearing Lu Jie say those words.<br>But, they were unable to understand why Lu Jie refused to challenge Chu Feng. Could it be that he was really afraid of him?<br>But, that shouldn&rsquo;t be the case. Lu Jie shouldn&rsquo;t be someone who would be so scared so easily.<br>On the contrary, he was very competitive.<br>Suddenly, someone pointed at the flag on the Ancient Compliance Castle and shouted, &ldquo;Look! The name on the flag has disappeared!&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, everyone turned to the flags.<br>It was only then that they discovered that the first of the three flags, the flag that used to have Lu Jie&rsquo;s name on it, had undergone a transformation.<br>The flag itself did not change. Instead, Lu Jie&rsquo;s name had disappeared.<br>Seeing his name disappearing from the flag, Lu Jie&rsquo;s expression changed somewhat. He was no longer as indifferent as before.<br>Even though he'd said that he didn't care about it, one could tell from his nervous gaze that he actually cared a lot.<br>&ldquo;Who would&rsquo;ve imagined that Chu Feng&hellip; had conquered the Talent Steps so quickly!&rdquo;<br>Chen Guang and Yue Yang&rsquo;s expressions became complicated.<br>Even though they knew that Chu Feng would most definitely challenge the Talent Steps, they had not expected him to challenge them this quickly.<br>Furthermore, from the way things looked, he had most likely already succeeded in his challenge.<br>In terms of talent, Chu Feng would most definitely surpass Lu Jie.<br>&ldquo;What a powerful youngster.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly whose disciple is that Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone, have any of you heard of a Chu Feng before?&rdquo;<br>The surroundings grew extremely noisy. Everyone was inquiring about Chu Feng.<br>But, none of the grand existences knew of a youngster by the name of Chu Feng. They had no idea where he had come from.<br>The more unknown Chu Feng was, the more curious the crowd became.<br>Seeing the crowd acting like that, Grandmaster Tang Chen, who was still concealed in the sky, smiled gleefully.<br>He had known that Chu Feng would shock the crowd.<br>Merely, he had not expected it to occur so quickly.<br>&ldquo;That is?&rdquo;<br>Soon, Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s complexion turned stiff.<br>The reason for that was because the first flag had begun changing again. Gradually, two characters appeared.<br>There was a name. But, it wasn&rsquo;t Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>What appeared on the flag was Yu Ting!<br></p></div>
