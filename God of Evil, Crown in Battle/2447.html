        <div> - Returning Domineeringly<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, the person I admire the most in my life is Lord Zhan Haichuan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the person that I now admire the second most would be you.&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said to Chu Feng with a gaze filled with admiration.<br>&ldquo;Lingtong, this person is?&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s older sister Zhan Lingling asked in a very curious manner.<br>She was truly filled with curiosity toward Chu Feng. She really wanted to know who it was that had saved her from Yao Liutian.<br>Furthermore, he had saved her at a crucial moment.<br>&ldquo;Big sister, this person here is big brother Chu Feng. He is an extraordinary individual; he is from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br>&ldquo;Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?&rdquo; Upon hearing that name, both Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s older sister and the other injured War Clansman revealed an enormous change in expression. Both of them revealed deep shock.<br>What sort of place was the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm? It was the place that everyone in the War Clan&rsquo;s Ancient Domain wanted to enter.<br>To them, being able to enter the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm was an extravagant hope.<br>To put it simply, the people there had pretty much the same sort of mindset as the people of the Holy Land of Martialism had in wanting to enter the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>To both of them, it was a sort of extravagant hope.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor, are you really from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s older sister asked Chu Feng.<br>Although she still felt disbelief, the fact that she addressed Chu Feng as &lsquo;benefactor&rsquo; fully showed how grateful she was toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t address me like that. I&rsquo;m not that old. You can just call me Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>[1. Zhan Lingling addressed Chu Feng as you(nin, respectful form) as opposed to you (ni, casual form.)]<br>This Zhan Lingling was several hundred years old already. In terms of age, she was much older than Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;My apologies, I was lacking in manners. Merely, a place like the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm is truly&hellip;&rdquo; Zhan Lingling spoke in a slightly embarrassed manner.<br>&ldquo;I know that this matter might be a bit hard for you to believe. However, I am not lying to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We can talk more about this on our way back. I fear that if we do not return soon, those refugees will end up suffering at your husband&rsquo;s hands,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;My husband? Refugees? What is going on here?&rdquo; Zhan Lingling revealed a puzzled look.<br>&ldquo;Big sister, this was what happened. When I was searching for Yue&rsquo;er, I was unfortunately caught by people from the Monstrous Clan and sent to the mine. It is big brother Chu Feng who saved me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the citizens of our Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan were also captured and reduced to slaves in the mine. At that time, they begged big brother Chu Feng to save them. Seeing how pitiful they were, we decided to bring them with us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, when we returned to the clan with great difficulty, brother-in-law barred the way and refused their entrance. He said that those commoners possessed petty and low statuses, and were not qualified to set foot into the territory of our Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br>&ldquo;He is truly becoming more and more excessive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will definitely reason with him upon my return.&rdquo;<br>After finding out about that, Zhan Lingling did not show any trace of planning to side with her husband. Instead, she revealed an angry expression and took the lead to fly toward the direction of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan.<br>In response, Chu Feng hurriedly followed after. Furthermore, he unleashed his Azure Dragon Dashing Technique.<br>After all, if he was the one leading the way, their speed would be faster.<br>&hellip;...<br>Inside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan. Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law, as well as the others from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan, were still present.<br>Merely, the humans, including Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s lover Yue&rsquo;er, were all driven out of the territory of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan.<br>Like a bunch of refugees, they stood in midair, unable to enter but unwilling to leave. They looked very pitiful.<br>&ldquo;That bastard, I will definitely teach him a lesson!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law&rsquo;s face was completely bruised up and there was still blood at the corner of his mouth.<br>Naturally, his injury was caused by Chu Feng. Actually&hellip; for martial cultivators of their level, such bruises were only minor injuries.<br>As long as he took some medicinal pellets, he would be able to completely recover from the bruises. However, he did not do so. The reason for that was because he wanted to keep those injuries.<br>&ldquo;Milord, we have already dispatched men to request Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s presence. I believe that Lord Clan Chief will soon arrive,&rdquo; Someone said.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law nodded. A strange expression was flashing in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Zhan Quezhi, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Where are Lingling and Lingtong right now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly what has happened here?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, an ear-piercing voice exploded in the sky.<br>Following that, a figure appeared out of thin air and stood before the crowd.<br>He was an old man. He was wearing a gold gown with a headdress.<br>His sword-like eyebrows appeared very imposing even without him being angry. His entire body was emitting the presence of a ruler.<br>Furthermore, he possessed the powerful aura of a rank four Martial Ancestor.<br>As for that individual, he was naturally the current Clan Chief of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan, Zhan Lingling and Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s father.<br>This Lord Clan Chief had received news that his daughter had been captured by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s great sex fiend.<br>Furthermore, he had also received news that his son, Zhan Lingtong, was captured by a spy of the Monstrous Clan. Thus, he was burning with anxiety.<br>After all, his daughter and son were his beloved children.<br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to Lord Clan Chief!!!&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing the Lord Clan Chief, Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law and all of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clansmen present immediately half-kneeled in midair to show their respect.<br>&ldquo;All of you, stand up. Do you even know what the situation is to continue to bother with this etiquette? Zhan Quezhi, exactly what happened? Quick, provide me an explanation,&rdquo; The Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, it is all because of my incompetence, all because of my incompetence,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law immediately started to blame himself with an expression of grievance.<br>Then, he told their Lord Clan Chief of what had happened.<br>He was quite truthful in telling their Lord Clan Chief how Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s older sister had been captured.<br>However, when it came to the matter regarding Zhan Lingtong himself, what he told was completely false.<br>The way he spoke, Chu Feng was simply not the benefactor that had saved Zhan Lingtong.<br>Rather, he was the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s spy.<br>He declared that it was Chu Feng that had captured Zhan Lingtong and their injured War Clansman that knew where Zhan Lingling was.<br>He declared that they were unable to rescue Zhan Lingling because they did not know where she was.<br>&ldquo;What utter bastards! I truly never would expected the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Monstrous Clan to be so despicable as to disguise themselves as people of our of War Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I am to capture that spy, I will definitely make him suffer a fate worse than death.&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, after Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law twisted the truth, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief grew extremely furious.<br>Practically everyone could sense his overflowing killing intent.<br>They could tell that their Lord Clan Chief was truly furious.<br>However, no one noticed that when Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law discovered that their Lord Clan Chief was truly furious, he revealed a proud smile at having succeeded in his plot.<br>&ldquo;Father!!!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, two familiar voices sounded.<br>When those two voices were heard, the expressions of everyone present changed.<br>The reason for that was because those voices were simply Zhan Lingtong and Zhan Lingling&rsquo;s voices.<br>However, weren&rsquo;t the two of them captured?<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>The very next moment, a dragon roar was heard, shaking the sky.<br>Soon, an enormous azure dragon arrived in midair. It directly passed through the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s grand defensive formation and entered their territory.<br>When they saw the azure dragon, the people of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan thought that it was an invasion from the Monstrous Clan, and subconsciously raised their weapons.<br>However, upon clearly seeing the four individuals standing atop the dragon&rsquo;s head, they were all stunned.<br>The reason for that was because those four individuals were naturally Chu Feng and the others.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; In terms of being the most stunned, it would be none other than Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law.<br>Although he was stunned, it remained that the people standing on the dragon were his wife and his brother-in-law. As such, he was feeling very joyous in his heart. He hurriedly walked toward his beloved wife.<br>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; Ling, you&rsquo;re alright? This is truly great. I was worried dea&hellip;&rdquo;<br>However, faced with her husband who was walking toward her with a deeply concerned expression on his face, Zhan Lingling did not bother to even pay attention to him. Instead, she walked past him.<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Zhan Quezhi stood there in a stunned manner. He was completely perplexed.<br>As for Zhan Lingling and Zhan Lingtong, they arrived before their father, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br><br></p></div>
