        <h1>Chapter 3290</h1>
        <div> - Granted Death Exemption Title Plate<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The eight activated Bloodline Cultivation Formations were shining brightly with light. They were very awe-inspiring.<br>Adding on the words floating in the sky, the crowd present all felt endlessly excited.<br>At that moment, the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan finally realized why Chu Xuanzhengfa would say that sort of thing, why he would reprimand the crowd for criticizing Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent, and even dare to argue against Supreme Elder Chu Hanqing.<br>Indeed, the Bloodline Altar had been destroyed. However, in exchange, the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations would remain open forever.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that Chu Feng was inferior to the older generation. Instead, he had done something completely unprecedented.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent was as bright as the sun; incomparably radiating.<br>At that moment, everyone began to seek out Chu Feng from the crowd.<br>However, upon finding Chu Feng, they did not dare to look him in the face.<br>The reason for that was because they were feeling ashamed.<br>As the crowd remained silent, the one to begin speaking was actually the person with the greatest authority in the Chu Heavenly Clan, their Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;The eight formations shall remain forever opened, forever opened.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clansman Chu Feng managed to complete that mysterious excellency&rsquo;s formation and activate the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations, opening them forever.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Under the heavens, who would dare to question Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent again?&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief looked toward the sky and spoke loudly. Not only was his voice filled with joy, but it was also filled with heroic airs.<br>Ecstatic, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was simply overjoyed.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had accomplished what was impossible for even Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is a blessing to our Chu Heavenly Clan bestowed by the heavens, a blessing bestowed by the heavens!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was truly wild with joy. The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had always had a steady and unflustered temperament his entire life. Very rarely would he lose control over his emotions. However at that moment&hellip; he had lost control of his emotions.<br>He didn&rsquo;t care about what his clansmen might think. All he wanted was to release his emotions fully.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief walked in midair and arrived before Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ve prepared a gift for you. Today is the perfect opportunity for me to give it to you.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief took out an item from his bosom and handed it to Chu Feng.<br>Seeing the item, the expressions of the people present all changed. Deep shock emerged in their eyes.<br>The item in their Clan Chief&rsquo;s hand was a title plate. That title plate was made from indestructible golden steel. That sort of steel was extremely rare, and was a top quality material used in the construction of Immortal Armaments.<br>The fact that a title plate was constructed using that sort of material was enough proof of how invaluable it was.<br>Ignoring everything else, merely the material used to construct it was sufficient to cause a bloody conflict.<br>However, for Chu Xuanzhengfa, Chu Hanpeng, Chu Hanqing and the other grand characters of the Chu Heavenly Clan to react in such an astonished manner, it was definitely not merely because of the material used to construct that title plate.<br>The reason for their reaction was because of the two characters on the title plate: &lsquo;Death Exemption!!!&rsquo;<br>That&hellip; was a Death Exemption Title Plate.<br>In all the years of the Chu Heavenly Clan, never had there ever been a Death Exemption Title Plate. Yet before them&hellip; their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief actually forged a Death Exemption Title Plate and granted it to Chu Feng before all those people.<br>That&hellip; was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s very first Death Exemption Title Plate in their entire history of existence!!!<br>The crowd were all able to imagine how much significance that Death Exemption Title Plate held.<br>That was not merely a Death Exemption Title Plate, it was also a sign of how much their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief valued Chu Feng, and how much hope he had in him.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what are you&hellip;?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the Death Exemption Title Plate, even Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes were filled with astonishment.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, with this title plate in hand, no one in the clan can touch you. Not to mention others, not even this old man will be able to do anything to you,&rdquo; after the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief finished saying those words, he forcibly pushed the Death Exemption Title Plate into Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>Then, he grabbed the wrist of the hand that held the title plate and raised it high. He looked around and spoke loudly, &ldquo;All members of the Chu Heavenly Clan, listen up!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;From today on, regardless of what sort of mistake Chu Feng might commit, no one is allowed to touch him, allowed to harm him!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If anyone dares to disobey this order, they will be killed without exception!!!&rdquo;<br>&hellip;...<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>After the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief gave such an order, the crowd that were already astonished were now unable to contain their emotions.<br>At that moment, they were no longer only astonished. Instead, they were frightened and flustered.<br>Regardless of what wrongs he might commit, regardless of what sort of consequence he might bring upon himself, none of them could touch him?<br>If that was the case, wouldn&rsquo;t it make Chu Feng above the law and completely out of control?<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, you absolutely must not do such a thing. While it is fine for you to grant Chu Feng a Death Exemption Title Plate that will excuse him from death once, you absolutely cannot shield him like this,&rdquo; Chu Hanqing said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, you absolutely must not do such a thing!!!&rdquo;<br>Following Chu Hanqing apart from Chu Xuanzhengfa and a few others, all of the elders present simultaneously clasped their fists and bowed respectfully to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;And why is it that I cannot do such a thing?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief narrowed his brows. An expression of anger appeared in his deep eyes.<br>Seeing this, many people began to tremble in fear and quietly lowered their heads, afraid to say any more.<br>Only Chu Hanqing continued to speak. However, he did not say a lot either, and merely uttered, &ldquo;A failure of impartiality.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Indeed, it&rsquo;s a failure of impartiality,&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng echoed.<br>&ldquo;Impartiality?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When outsiders bullied our clan, did anyone ever mention anything regarding impartiality to them?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>The crowd were all quiet. They did not know how to respond.<br>To talk about impartiality toward the people that had bullied them, wouldn&rsquo;t that simply be courting death?<br>Who would possibly dare to do that?<br>No one would dare to do that.<br>&ldquo;Since you all are not answering, I will answer for you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In this world where might is right, do not mention things like fairness and impartiality. The only thing that one needs to concern oneself with is strength.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Only by possessing sufficient strength will one be able to talk about fairness and impartiality.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Faced with the Starfield Master Realm, no matter how unfair of a command they give, we will have no choice but to endure it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, no matter how unfair of a thing our Chu Heavenly Clan might do, the other powers can only comply with us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fairness? Impartiality? Those are privileges only the strong can enjoy,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, what you&rsquo;ve said is reasonable. However, Chu Feng&hellip; is he the strongest of our clan?&rdquo; Chu Hanqing questioned.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is not the strongest of our clan. However, he is the most talented, the most promising individual in our clan. He is the hope of our Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For a clansman like him, for a person of the younger generation like him, our Chu Heavenly Clan should spare no effort and disregard everything to protect him, nurture him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We are not to think of ways to deliberately make things difficult for him and prevent his growth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Preventing Chu Feng&rsquo;s growth is equivalent to preventing the growth of our Chu Heavenly Clan. People that do that are not qualified to be members of our Chu Heavenly Clan, and shall be executed!!!&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s voice was akin to thunder; it was like he was announcing an undefiable order.<br>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Hanqing still wanted to say something.<br>&ldquo;There is no &lsquo;but&rsquo;. As long as I remain the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, no one in our Chu Heavenly Clan is allowed to become Chu Feng&rsquo;s enemy. Those who make an enemy of Chu Feng will be making an enemy of our Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for those that make an enemy of our Chu Heavenly Clan, they will be traitors to our clan,&rdquo; after the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke to this point, he looked to Chu Xuanzhengfa and asked, &ldquo;Chu Xuanzhengfa, how shall traitors to the clan be punished?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, traitors shall be punished with death,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa replied with his fist clasped.<br>&ldquo;Did you all hear that properly?!&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked loudly.<br>His voice was akin to thunder. Not only did it cause the surrounding space to tremble, but the hearts of the crowd present were also utterly intimidated by his words.<br>Their Lord Clan Chief was determined to protect Chu Feng. Who would dare to go against him?<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, we understand,&rdquo; with the situation being like that, apart from Chu Hanpeng and Chu Hanqing, the others present all replied in unison.<br>They all realized that, from that day onward, they could offend anyone in the Chu Heavenly Clan except Chu Feng.<br>Otherwise, they would be met with a great catastrophe.<br></p></div>
