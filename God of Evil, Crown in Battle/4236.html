        <div> - Is There Anyone Else That Is Still Unconvinced?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Young friend, could you introduce yourself?&rdquo;<br>Old Man Compliance did not bother paying attention to the people that greeted him respectfully. Instead, he looked directly at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng pays his respects to senior.&rdquo; Chu Feng immediately clasped his fist respectfully to greet Old Man Compliance.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng? Very good.&rdquo; Old Man Compliance nodded. Then, with a flick of his wrist, a rectangular case appeared in his hand.<br>The case was two feet long and a foot wide. It appeared very simple and unadorned.<br>Although it looked slightly shabby, one could tell from a single glance that it was something extraordinary.<br>At that moment, many people used special observational methods to try to see through the case and see what was inside.<br>But none of them were able to see through it.<br>Because of that, the crowd began making guesses nonstop. They all felt what was inside the case was most certainly a priceless treasure.<br>After all, Old Man Compliance had taken out the case in such a serious manner. That in itself was enough to signify how valuable the case was.<br>Old Man compliance raised the case in his hand and said to the crowd, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng has opened the Hidden Gate. This is his additional reward.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Reward? There&rsquo;s a reward?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were endlessly envious after hearing those words.<br>Such a priceless treasure was going to fall into the hands of that unknown fellow?<br>&ldquo;Milord, exactly what is that reward?&rdquo; Someone asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;It is naturally an essential treasure to young world spiritists like yourselves,&rdquo; said Old Man Compliance.<br>Once he said those words, the crowd that were already filled with envy became even more envious.<br>But, at that moment, Old Man Compliance spoke again.<br>&ldquo;But according to the rules, if someone is unconvinced with this, they can issue a challenge.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If their world spirit techniques surpass the person who is to obtain this reward, they can obtain this treasure instead.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, if they fail their challenge, they&rsquo;ll have to pay a price too. That is, they will no longer be qualified to set foot into this Ancient Compliance Castle for the rest of their life,&rdquo; said Old Man Compliance.<br>&ldquo;This punishment!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, hesitation appeared on the faces of many people.<br>This punishment was simply too severe.<br>The reason why the Ancient Compliance Castle held such appeal to them was because of the Compliance Mirror.<br>Although they could only use the Compliance Mirror once every time they were in the Ancient Compliance Castle, they could use it whenever they entered the Ancient Compliance Castle again.<br>In other words, as long as they were strong enough, they would be able to obtain a treasure that could immediately help them every time they set foot into the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>To them, the value of the Ancient Compliance Castle was simply enormous.<br>It wouldn't even be excessive to say that it was an endless treasure trove.<br>If they were unable to enter the Ancient Compliance Castle again, it would be an enormous price to pay.<br>Because they didn't know exactly how powerful Chu Feng was, many people were hesitating.<br>Even though they were unconvinced by Chu Feng and did not approve of him getting the treasure, they still didn't dare take on such a risk to challenge him.<br>They were afraid.<br>What if they ended up being defeated by him? The price they would have to pay was simply too much.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll challenge him.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice was heard.<br>It was Chen Guang.<br>Compared to the others, Chen Guang knew Chu Feng somewhat.<br>Although he was very surprised by Chu Feng&rsquo;s opening of the Hidden Gate, the impression that Chu Feng had given him during their first encounter was simply too bad.<br>As such, Chen Guang had looked down on Chu Feng the entire time.<br>He felt that Chu Feng was nothing more than trash.<br>Even though Chu Feng had opened the Hidden Gate, he felt that it must've been because of luck.<br>Even if Chu Feng possessed true ability, Chen Guang still felt that Chu Feng would not match up to him.<br>&ldquo;Introduce yourself before your challenge,&rdquo; said Old Man Compliance.<br>He naturally knew who Chen Guang was, but he was strict with the rules.<br>Everyone knew Old Man Compliance&rsquo;s personality. As such, Chen Guang did not take offense to it, and gave a self-introduction.<br>&ldquo;I am the disciple of the North Star Heavenly Master, Chen Guang.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am unconvinced with this Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, I will issue a challenge. I wonder if this brother dares accept my challenge?&rdquo; Chen Guang asked with a stern, sonorous and powerful voice. Not only could his confidence be felt through his voice, one could also sense his desire to challenge Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you have no choice. If you refuse to accept the challenge, it&rsquo;ll be equivalent to admitting defeat.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should that happen, this treasure will belong to Chen Guang,&rdquo; Old Man Compliance warned Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Since I have no choice, I won&rsquo;t have to make one.&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed a faint smile.<br>Then, he turned to Chen Guang and said, &ldquo;Brother Chen Guang, due to my personal issues last time, we were unable to spar. This will serve to make up for the regret from last time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chen Guang, step onto the stage.&rdquo;<br>As Old Man Compliance spoke, he waved his sleeve, and a spirit formation gate appeared before Chen Guang.<br>Chen Guang stepped into the spirit formation gate and entered the sealed region.<br>Chen Guang did not directly begin the battle. Instead, he turned to Old Man Compliance and asked respectfully, &ldquo;Milord, are there any rules?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The two of you can decide the rules for yourselves.&rdquo;<br>As Old Man Compliance spoke, he formed a rocking chair with his spirit formation and sat on it with his eyes closed.<br>He appeared to be unconcerned about the outcome of the spar between Chu Feng and Chen Guang.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, let&rsquo;s decide the rules then.&rdquo;<br>Right after Chen Guang spoke, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in a rush for time here. Let&rsquo;s finish this quickly. We can directly use our world spirit techniques to determine a victor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You mean to say, you want us to fight directly using world spirit techniques?&rdquo; Chen Guang asked. He was slightly surprised by Chu Feng&rsquo;s proposal.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s my intention.&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Since that&rsquo;s the case, I won&rsquo;t hold back.&rdquo;<br>As Chen Guang spoke, he began setting up a spirit formation.<br>He wanted to seize the decisive opportunity.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>But, to his surprise, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t bother to make any preparations at all. He directly raised his hand and sent forth a palm strike. His spirit power was shot forth from the cuff of his sleeve.<br>His released spirit power immediately began to transform. It turned into a golden rhinoceros measuring over ten meters long that rushed straight toward Chen Guang.<br>&ldquo;This guy!&rdquo;<br>Chen Guang hadn't thought that Chu Feng would launch a direct attack at him.<br>Such an attack was simply too imperious.<br>It simply resembled a martial cultivator attacking using martial power without using any martial skills.<br>It did not befit the glamor of a world spiritist battle.<br>What surprised Chen Guang the most was that Chu Feng&rsquo;s golden rhinoceros that he'd sent forth so casually was extremely fast. By the time he managed to react to it, he was unable to avoid it.<br>But, Chen Guang did not panic. The spirit formation he was setting up was one that could be used both offensively and defensively. Furthermore, it was a spirit formation whose power was determined by how long he took to set it up.<br>He was totally capable of releasing it immediately.<br>Moreover, he felt that it would be an effortless task for him to block Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack.<br>As such, Chen Guang didn't panic, he was instead immensely pleased with himself. Just like that, he stopped setting up his spirit formation and used it to block the incoming rhinoceros.<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s golden rhinoceros arrived before Chen Guang.<br>The golden rhinoceros showed no fear when facing Chen Guang&rsquo;s bastion-like spirit formation. It lowered its head and charged forth with its horn.<br>&ldquo;Boom---&rdquo;<br>In the next instant, a loud explosion was heard, and energy ripples scattered in all directions.<br>What followed stunned everyone.<br>The golden rhinoceros had not only effortlessly crushed Chen Guang&rsquo;s spirit formation to pieces, even Chen Guang had been sent flying by the charge.<br>Most importantly, Chen Guang was completely bloodied when he landed on the ground. He had grown extremely weak.<br>He was no longer capable of fighting.<br>Although they all knew that an outcome would be determined by the match, that was Chen Guang of all people, one of the most outstanding geniuses of the younger generation.<br>Whilst everyone was still immersed in shock, Chu Feng suddenly spoke, &ldquo;Is there anyone else that&rsquo;s still unconvinced?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
