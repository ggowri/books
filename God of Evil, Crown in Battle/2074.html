        <h1>Chapter 2073</h1>
        <div> - Immortalization Road<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>At that moment, Qiushui Fuyan was placed in a difficult situation. She knew Chu Feng&rsquo;s personality extremely well. As such, she was afraid that Chu feng would put himself into danger.<br>However, it was precisely because she knew Chu Feng&rsquo;s personality that she knew that she would not be able to make Chu feng change his mind. Thus, she said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng and Qiushui Fuyan left, the others present all stood up and followed after them.<br>Being led by Qiushui Fuyan, Chu Feng soon arrived at the so-called Immortalization Road.<br>It was a special gate. Even though the gate appeared to be constructed of carved stones, it was actually formed with a very powerful spirit technique.<br>Most importantly, although the gate did not appear to be special, it gave off a dense amount of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura like Qiushui Fuyan had said.<br>The moment Chu Feng saw the Immortalization Road, Chu Feng started to frown deeply.<br>Even though it was only a spirit formation gate, Chu Feng was able to tell how powerful the creator of the spirit formation gate was merely by looking at the spirit formation gate.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength had advanced by leaps and bounds after this many years had passed. Not only had Chu Feng become a Martial Emperor-level expert, he had also became a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist and was a major character in the Holy Land of Martialism. But even Chu Feng felt a sensation when he stood before the Immortalization Road&rsquo;s entrance gate. That was, the sensation of being small.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let me accompany you in there,&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that. It would do for me to go in there alone. Everyone, do not follow me in,&rdquo; After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he stepped onto the Immortalization Road.<br>At that moment, the expressions of the crowd all turned stiff. They were worried about Chu Feng and wanted to follow him in. Merely, they didn&rsquo;t want to go against Chu Feng&rsquo;s desire either. That was why they were hesitating right now.<br>After a moment of hesitation, Lady Piaomiao said, &ldquo;Ya Fei and them possessed a special relationship with Chu Feng. He possesses a knot in his heart that was originally capable of being undone by Ya Fei and the others that disappeared. However, now, he can only rely on himself. As such, it might be better that he enter alone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, inside the Immortalization Road is&hellip;&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan as well as the others present were still very worried.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, have you all forgotten about little friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent? It has been many years now. You all have managed to make improvements to your strength. As such, how could he have not?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It might even be possible that the current little friend Chu Feng is already a Martial Emperor,&rdquo; Lady Piaomiao said.<br>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s possible that Chu Feng is a rank nine Martial King. As for Martial Emperor, that&rsquo;s a bit too far-fetched.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, even Huangfu Haoyue said that it was very difficult to reach a breakthrough to the Martial Emperor realm. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the treasures that had been discovered on the Immortalization Road, he would not have had the opportunity to attempt the breakthrough either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent is extremely high, it remains that he&rsquo;s very young,&rdquo; Qiu Canfeng and the others said. They all felt that Chu Feng was most definitely stronger than them. However, they did not believe him to be a Martial Emperor.<br>Although it has been several years since Chu Feng had left, to people that had cultivated for hundreds of years like them, several years simply could not amount to much at all. At Chu Feng&rsquo;s level, to be able to reach peak Martial King in several years would already be a miracle. As for becoming a Martial Emperor, that was simply impossible.<br>Most importantly, Chu Feng had personally said that he would be no match for Huangfu Haoyue if Huangfu Haoyue were to successfully reach a breakthrough.<br>Thus, from those words, the crowd was able to deduce Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation to be still at the Martial King level.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s also precisely the reason why he should enter the Immortalization Road. Perhaps he might be able to obtain benefits from it. It might even be possible for his cultivation to increase. Thus, we should let him enter,&rdquo; Lady Piaomiao said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; At that moment, the crowd&rsquo;s nervousness was eased. Although the depths of the Immortalization Road were extremely dangerous, they possessed a special sort of power. As they all knew how strong Chu Feng&rsquo;s comprehension was, they felt that Chu Feng might really be able to obtain a harvest from entering the Immortalization Road.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a loud explosion sounded from afar. Following that, a dazzling blaze soared into the sky.<br>When that blaze appeared, an enormous oppressive sensation followed suit. That sort of oppressive sensation was something that the people present had never felt before.<br>After sensing that oppressive sensation and seeing that dazzling blaze, the people present all revealed overjoyed expressions.<br>One by one, they soared into the sky and began to fly toward that blaze.<br>Soon, the blaze and that oppressive might started to dissipate. Then, a man appeared in their midst.<br>That man was Huangfu Haoyue.<br>At that moment, Qiushui Fuyan was wild with joy. Unable to contain herself, she asked, &ldquo;Haoyue, you&rsquo;ve succeeded?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mn, this is Emperor-level martial power. I have successfully broken through to the Martial Emperor realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; Huangfu Haoyue started to hesitate.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan and the others all asked in a deeply concerned manner.<br>&ldquo;I am able to sense Emperor-level martial power now. Merely, the amount that I can make use of is extremely limited. I keep feeling that I am unable to make use of the most concentrated and pure Emperor-level power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In other words, although I am able to use Emperor-level martial power, I am unable to use the actual Emperor-level martial power,&rdquo; Huangfu Haoyue said with a frown.<br>&ldquo;Although you&rsquo;ve broken through to Martial Emperor realm, it remains that you&rsquo;re only a rank one Martial Emperor. It is normal that you are unable to completely grasp Emperor-level martial power,&rdquo; Taikou said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. The most important thing is that you&rsquo;ve become a Martial Emperor. Now, we no longer have to be afraid of that bunch of Blood Qilins,&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan said.<br>Upon mentioning the Blood Qilins, the crowd present all revealed expressions of hatred. They were impatient to have Huangfu Haoyue teach that bunch a lesson.<br>Merely, at that moment, Qiu Canfeng&rsquo;s expression changed. He involuntarily looked to Xue Xiyue who stood beside him.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, although Huangfu Haoyue has become a Martial Emperor, the Blood Qilins still cannot be looked down upon.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Earlier, I went to the Everlasting Sea of Blood to scout things out. At that place, I felt an extremely frightening oppressive might. Although I was unable to ascertain things at that time, I am able to do so now. I am sure that the Blood Qilins&rsquo; Clan Chief has also broken through to the Martial Emperor realm. The reason for that is because that oppressive might felt exactly the same as the one that you brought us,&rdquo; Xue Xiyue said sternly.<br>&ldquo;What? The Blood Qilins&rsquo; Clan Chief also broke through to the Martial Emperor realm? It is no wonder the Blood Qilins are acting so arrogantly. In the letter they sent us yesterday, they demanded that we leave the Misty Peak immediately. Else, they would come and kill all of us with their army,&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan said with a frown.<br>Yesterday, Qiushui Fuyan had received a letter. After seeing the contents of the letter, she had thought the Blood Qilins to be extremely arrogant and conceited. However, after hearing what Xue Xiyue said, and considering the time when Xue Xiyue had returned to the Misty Peak and the timing of the letter, she felt that it was very likely that the Blood Qilins&rsquo; Clan Chief had managed to break through to the Martial Emperor realm, and that they had sent the letter after he had reached a breakthrough.<br>Now that she thought about it, that was simply no letter. Instead, it was a written challenge.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to fear? Haoyue has also became a Marital Emperor now. Even if that Blood Qilins&rsquo; Clan Chief is also a Martial Emperor, he would only have the same level of cultivation as Haoyue.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If they wish to come, then let them come. This would serve as a perfect opportunity to settle them. I&rsquo;ll give the order to have our Crippling Night Demon Sect&rsquo;s army gather here,&rdquo; Qiu Canfeng said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We not only have the Martial Emperor senior Huangfu Haoyue here, there&rsquo;s also junior brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My junior brother Chu Feng was able to defeat even those fellows from the Holy Land of Martialism back then. How could he possibly fear a bunch of fish that overestimates themselves?&rdquo; Chun Wu said in an immensely proud manner.<br>Even though the crowd all felt that Chu Feng was not a Martial Emperor, Chun Wu was still extremely confident in Chu Feng.<br><br></p></div>
