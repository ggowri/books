        <div> - Hidden Expert<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Immemorial Cosmos Map?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master, is the Immemorial Cosmos Map some sort of treasure?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng grew interested upon hearing those words.<br>The word &lsquo;immemorial&rsquo; brought upon great expectation toward Chu Feng.<br>After all, Chu Feng already knew that the Immemorial Era was a time even more distant and more mysterious than the Ancient Era.<br>The Immemorial Era was the true origin of martial cultivators.<br>&ldquo;In short, this inheritance is remarkable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for exactly what it is, kiddo, you can slowly make guesses yourself,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist with a mischievous smile.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng felt extremely helpless.<br>Wasn&rsquo;t the Ox-nosed Old Daoist deliberately teasing him?<br>Exactly what sort of master did he end up becoming the disciple of?<br>Soon after, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist removed his spirit formation isolating Chu Feng and him.<br>After the spirit formation dissipated, Chu Feng discovered that there were not a lot of people around.<br>The majority of the vast crowd of hundreds of millions had left already.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was not surprised by this scene.<br>Although he had used his ability to torment those people, the torture does not last forever.<br>Once the power of his spirit formation dissipates, those people will break free from the torture. Naturally, the first thing they would do would be fleeing from this area.<br>After all, they couldn&rsquo;t possibly continue to remain here and wait for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to torture them again.<br>As such, apart from Grandmaster Tang Chen and others that possess a decent relationship with Chu Feng, the only people that remained were people that did not offend Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d it go? Did you manage to obtain the inheritance?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly what sort of inheritance was it?&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen and others discovered that the stele had disappeared. They realized that Chu Feng must&rsquo;ve obtained the inheritance.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve obtained the inheritance. As for what it is, that&rsquo;s going to be a secret.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, to world spiritists, this inheritance is something that they would yearn for in their dreams.&rdquo;<br>Because of that, I will not be handing this inheritance to Chu Feng for the time being. As his master, I will have to enjoy its benefits first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can consider it his show of filial respect toward me. Hehe&hellip;&rdquo; Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke with a vile smile.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the crowd felt completely speechless.<br>They all knew that Chu Feng managed to obtain that inheritance because he breached the chess formation and then defeated Lu Jie.<br>That inheritance should belong to Chu Feng.<br>Yet, Chu Feng&rsquo;s master actually decided to keep it for himself. This was simply too excessive.<br>However, when they saw how Chu Feng was showing no complaint and instead smiling, the crowd knew that Chu Feng was not opposed to it.<br>Since even Chu Feng himself was not opposed to it, it would naturally be improper for the crowd to say anything.<br>Of course, they&rsquo;ve all witnessed how ruthless the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was earlier.<br>Even if they possess objections, none would dare to voice it.<br>What the crowd didn&rsquo;t know was that there were three other figures witnessing the sight of them being afraid of voicing their anger.<br>Those three people stood high above the clouds.<br>But, even though they were standing there, no one was aware of them.<br>Those three people were Fumo Shaoyu, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er and Lady Gusu who was pretending to be their grandmother.<br>&ldquo;This Ox-nose, he&rsquo;s simply bullying people too much. Young master, should I go and teach him a lesson?&rdquo; asked Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to teach him a lesson about? Can&rsquo;t you see how Chu Feng is smiling cheerfully? Even Chu Feng himself has no objection. This meant that the two of them possessed an extraordinary relationship and that Ox-nose is someone Chu Feng trusted,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;This Xin&rsquo;er was foolish,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not foolish. Instead, you&rsquo;ve had your head muddled by love.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as anyone took advantage of that Chu Feng, you will not be able to stand by idly and watch,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Lord young master, Xin&rsquo;er hasn&rsquo;t been muddled by love,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s complexion turned deathly pale after hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;Haha. I&rsquo;m just joking. Look how scared you became,&rdquo; laughed Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Young master, please don&rsquo;t joke with Xin&rsquo;er anymore,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Okay okay. I won&rsquo;t tease you anymore,&rdquo; laughed Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Young master, didn&rsquo;t you come here for Chu Feng&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why are we not showing ourselves?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why must we observe in secret?&rdquo; asked Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Let us wait a while. There&rsquo;s a hidden expert here,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a hidden expert? Who?&rdquo; asked Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;No idea. But, that expert&rsquo;s aura is simply unfathomable. That person is an expert that even I cannot handle,&rdquo; right at this moment, Lady Gusu spoke.<br>&ldquo;Lady Gusu also noticed it?&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er realized that things were not that simple after hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;Lord young master, are you also unable to determine who it is?&rdquo; asked Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;I can only detect a slight aura intermittently. But, I cannot be certain who it is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, as this person has remained here the entire time, they must possess some sort of purpose.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let us continue to observe. There must be a reason as to why that expert&rsquo;s aura is not completely concealed. Soon, that person will definitely reveal themself,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>Hearing those words, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er stopped asking more questions. Instead, she began to carefully size up the people below and the surroundings. She wanted to find out where that so-called expert was hiding or who he or she had disguised themself as.<br>Since it was an expert that not even Fumo Shaoyu and Lady Gusu could handle, that person must be someone very powerful.<br>While the appearance of such an expert in a desolate place like the Holy Light Galaxy might not affect them, it was unknown if it was a blessing or a curse to Chu Feng and others.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a figure flew down and landed before Chu Feng.<br>Seeing this person, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed.<br>The reason for that was because this person was Old Man Compliance.<br>Old Man Compliance was a rather cold and detached individual.<br>He was someone who would not involve himself in anything happening in the Holy Light Galaxy. He was also completely disinterested in everyone.<br>He has always been a lone operator. Although his reputation was outstanding, he was practically friendless.<br>But, everyone noticed that he was interested in Chu Feng today.<br>&ldquo;Old Thing Compliance, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly be planning to fight over my disciple, right?&rdquo; The Ox-nosed Old Daoist said to Old Man Compliance with a smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;Brother, you need not worry. This old man had no intention to take a disciple.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, I possess a task that I wish to seek young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s help with. Young friend Chu Feng, might you be willing to help me?&rdquo; said Old Man Compliance.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what help do you need?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Please speak away. As long as it&rsquo;s something that this Chu Feng could help with, I will definitely help,&rdquo; Chu Feng answered very courteously.<br>Chu Feng had benefited from the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>He also had a decent impression of Old Man Compliance. Thus, he was very willing to help Old Man Compliance.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, please follow this old man.&rdquo;<br>As Old Man Compliance spoke, he soared into the sky and began to walk toward the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>Seeing this, Chu Feng followed over.<br>After the two of them entered the Ancient Compliance Castle, Old Man Compliance took out a wooden case.<br>The case appeared very ordinary. But, there were three locks on the case.<br>Of the three locks, two possess keyholes. But, the lock in the center does not possess a keyhole. It was impossible to open that lock with an ordinary key.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I will be frank with you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man is unable to open the lock in the center.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, someone has prophesied that a person of the younger generation will appear in the Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That person of the younger generation will be able to ascend onto the Talent Steps&rsquo; third step.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should that person of the younger generation appear, they will be able to help me open this lock.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Originally, this old man was skeptical of that prophecy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, after what happened today, I felt that I had no choice but to believe in it,&rdquo; said Old Man Compliance.<br>&ldquo;Thus, senior wanted me to help you open this lock?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Old Man Compliance nodded.<br></p></div>
