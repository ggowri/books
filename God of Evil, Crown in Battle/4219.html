        <h1>Chapter 4218</h1>
        <div> - Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior Tang Chen, brother Yuan Shu.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is true that I&rsquo;ve only grasped rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation. The reason why my world spirit techniques possess power surpassing that of rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation is because my bloodline power has awakened,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Bloodline power has awakened?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, both Grandmaster Tang Chen and Yuan Shu were surprised. The two of them both looked to Chu Feng with curiosity-filled eyes.<br>Chu Feng then began telling them what had happened.<br>After all, it was thanks to Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s spirit formation that Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline power awakened.<br>&hellip;...<br>Meanwhile. Revered Master Beast Tamer and Li Fengxue had stepped onto their war chariot, and had traveled far away from the Seven Suns Mountain Range.<br>They were in an urgent rush to leave.<br>For the sake of quickly leaving the Seven Suns Mountain Range, Revered Master Beast Tamer had personally hastened the speed of the war chariot close to a terrifying level.<br>Due to him causing his master to lose the two incomplete maps he'd won, as well as the two incomplete maps he had, Li Fengxue was completely panic-stricken, and did not dare disturb his master, so much so that he did not even dare to say anything.<br>But, his complexion was growing uglier and uglier. He was in miserable pain. It seemed as if he was suffering from a serious illness, and was about to die.<br>Finally, he was unable to endure the pain anymore. He arrived before his master, who was rushing the war chariot, and knelt on the floor.<br>&ldquo;Master, I&hellip; I&rsquo;m about to reach my limit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master, please save me.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Li Fengxue collapsed onto the floor. He didn&rsquo;t even have the strength to continue kneeling.<br>Seeing that, Revered Master Beast Tamer hesitated slightly. In the end he cursed, &ldquo;Useless trash,&rdquo; and took out a bottle gourd.<br>Light immediately began circulating through the bottle gourd. Revered Master Beast Tamer turned the bottle gourd upside down and aimed it at Li Fengxue, &ldquo;Open your mouth.&rdquo;<br>Li Fengxue immediately did as he was told.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh---&rdquo;<br>Once he opened his mouth, a mouthful of blood sprayed out from his mouth like a pillar. The blood was pitch-black in color.<br>Not only that, the blood was also emitting a nauseating stink.<br>As the blood continued to spray from his mouth, a black centipede actually emerged from Li Fengxue&rsquo;s mouth.<br>Different from ordinary centipedes, the black centipede possessed an even more terrifying appearance.<br>Symbols and runes covered the centipede&rsquo;s entire body.<br>The centipede was struggling, and refusing to leave Li Fengxue&rsquo;s body.<br>However, through the suction of the bottle gourd, it was ultimately sucked out from Li Fengxue&rsquo;s mouth and into the bottle gourd.<br>Once the centipede was sucked out of his body, Li Fengxue immediately shriveled up. Even his appearance aged quite a lot.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, master.&rdquo;<br>He did not even have the strength to stand back up. Yet, he still thanked his master respectfully.<br>He knew that if his master hadn&rsquo;t removed the centipede, he would undoubtedly have been killed by it.<br>&ldquo;Useless trash. For the sake of helping you win against Yuan Shu and obtaining an Incomplete Map for me, this old man had paid a high price to obtain this Ghost Talisman Earth Dragon.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Else, with your strength, even though you&rsquo;ve also grasped rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation, how could you possibly be a match for that Yuan Shu?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, you ended up losing this old man&rsquo;s capital too!&rdquo; Revered Master Beast Tamer reprimanded him angrily.<br>Li Fengxue felt extremely wronged after hearing those words.<br>Indeed, that centipede had helped him increase the power of his world spirit techniques.<br>But, the pain that the centipede had brought him was even more terrifying than that of a forbidden medicine.<br>He had swallowed the centipede all so that he could help his master win an Incomplete Map of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>When all was said and done, he had gone through all that suffering for his master&rsquo;s sake.<br>&ldquo;This disciple was useless.&rdquo;<br>Although he felt wronged, Li Fengxue did not dare voice it, and continued to apologize nonstop.<br>&ldquo;Forget it, forget it. Take this medicinal pellet and rest.&rdquo;<br>Whilst the Revered Master Beast Tamer was furious, he didn't seem to have a heart of stone. In the end, he took out a medicinal pellet and tossed it to Li Fengxue, who was lying on the ground.<br>Li Fengxue immediately picked up the medicinal pellet and swallowed it.<br>Once the medicinal pellet entered his stomach, he finally regained some power.<br>&ldquo;Thank you master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master, please rest assured. This disciple will work hard on his training. I will make that Chu Feng suffer,&rdquo; guaranteed Li Fengxue.<br>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whilst that boy had only released battle power on par with a rank three Utmost Exalted, he has grasped rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation, and must possess a battle power on par with rank four Utmost Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, he is a person of the younger generation. His talent far surpasses your own.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could you possibly contend against him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That kid&rsquo;s talent is so terrifyingly strong. The way I see it, not even Lu Jie would be a match for his talent,&rdquo; said Revered Master Beast Tamer.<br>Li Fengxue didn&rsquo;t know how to respond.<br>Indeed. Looking at all the details, it would be very difficult for him to surpass Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Master, that Chu Feng knew Tang Chen and Yuan Shu.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;His master is most definitely someone extraordinary too. Might master know who his master is?&rdquo; Li Fengxue asked with great curiosity.<br>&ldquo;Humph, this old man doesn&rsquo;t care who his master might be.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since he dared to offend me, he can forget about living.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He will realize that this old man&rsquo;s possessions are not that easily obtained.&rdquo;<br>A ruthless look flashed through Revered Master Beast Tamer&rsquo;s eyes after he said those words. His furious look of anger had also alleviated a lot.<br>There was a reason why he was in such a rush to leave the Seven Suns Mountain Range.<br>&hellip;...<br>In the forbidden area within the Seven Suns Mountain Range.<br>Chu Feng, Yuan Shu and Grandmaster Tang Chen were still present.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that this old man&rsquo;s spirit formation would&rsquo;ve helped you awaken your bloodline&rsquo;s power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That day, I had only understood that your bloodline power was very strong. Never would I have imagined that your bloodline power would be this powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah, this old man is truly envious of that old bastard Ox-nose.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen gasped with admiration after learning that it was his grand formation that had awakened Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline.<br>&ldquo;Senior, is senior Ox-nose senior Zhuge Yuankong?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked all of a sudden.<br>The expressions of Grandmaster Tang Chen and Yuan Shu changed enormously after hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, where did you hear that sort of thing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>The calm Grandmaster Tang Chen was actually extremely nervous at that moment.<br>&ldquo;Seeing senior&rsquo;s reaction, this junior must&rsquo;ve guessed correctly,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Guessed? How did you guess that?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>He didn't seem to believe Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s purely a guess. There's a basis behind my guess.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng did not conceal the truth, and told Grandmaster Tang Chen and Yuan Shu how he had entered a remnant left behind by Zhuge Yuankong, and heard the voice left behind by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;The will of the heavens. This is truly the will of the heavens.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ox-nose had thought that no one would be able to breach the grand formation that he'd left behind.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who would&rsquo;ve thought that someone would actually manage to do it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, the person that breached his grand formation is his disciple of all people. This is truly the will of the heavens.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen gasped with admiration after learning what had happened.<br>After that, he looked to Chu Feng. &ldquo;Chu Feng, as matters stand, I will not conceal the truth from you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your guess is correct. Ox-nose&hellip; used to be the strongest world spiritist in the Holy Light Galaxy, Zhuge Yuankong,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough.&rdquo; Chu Feng was overjoyed to hear those words.<br>His happiness was not because of how extraordinary the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s identity was.<br>Rather, it was because Zhuge Yuankong knew how to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>&ldquo;Ji, ji, ji---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, strange sounds came from the Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain Chu Feng held in his hand.<br>Before Chu Feng could react to the noises, two black threads appeared from two of the Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain. They followed Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand and bored into his body.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahhh---&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng immediately started screaming, and fell powerlessly onto the ground the moment those black threads entered his body.<br>Chu Feng was in immense pain, and black lines covered his skin. Those black lines were rapidly moving through his body.<br>It seemed like there were countless black insects roaming throughout his body.<br>As the black lines moved, they brought Chu Feng an unbearable amount of pain.<br>&ldquo;This is the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That old bastard Beast Tamer is truly despicable!&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen cursed after seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s miserable condition.<br></p></div>
