        <div> - Distinction<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve already made an enemy of the Kong Heavenly Clan. If you are to kill us today, you will have made enemies of all four of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm&rsquo;s tier one powers. At that time, you will not be able to find anywhere safe.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There was originally no hatred between us. As such, there really isn&rsquo;t a need for you to go that far. It&rsquo;s still not too late to stop now.&rdquo;<br>As Dugu Jianxu urged Chu Feng not to kill him, he started to frantically attempt to escape in midair.<br>As for Chu Feng, he did not bother to stop Dugu Jianxu from trying his best to distance himself.<br>The reason for that was because Dugu Jianxu&rsquo;s cultivation had already been crippled by him. The remnants of his cultivation were simply insufficient for him to fear.<br>While Chu Feng was walking through the air in a very deemphasizing manner, his speed was extremely fast. He was many times faster than the fleeing Dugu Jianxu.<br>Thus, in merely the blink of an eye, Chu Feng and Zhao Hong had arrived before Dugu Jianxu.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng grabbed Dugu Jianxu&rsquo;s neck and lifted him up.<br>At that moment, Dugu Jianxu&rsquo;s body was trembling nonstop. One could tell with one&rsquo;s naked eye that he was truly scared.<br>&ldquo;Chu-Chu Feng, you must reconsider. If you are to kill me today, our Immortal Sword School will definitely not spare you,&rdquo; Dugu Jianxu threatened.<br>However, Chu Feng reacted as if he did not hear his threat at all. He turned to Zhao Hong and said, &ldquo;It would do to leave him an intact corpse.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Intact corpse?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that Chu Feng and Zhao Hong are really planning to kill Dugu Jianxu?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Dugu Jianxu is one of the most important people in the Immortal Sword School, the future successor to the Immortal Sword School&rsquo;s Headmaster. If Chu Feng and Zhao Hong are to kill him, the Immortal Sword School will definitely not let things go.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was truly preparing to kill, the bystanders grew even more frightened.<br>When even the bystanders were scared, one could very well imagine what sort of expression Dugu Jianxu currently had. He was completely terrified.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I beg of you, please, please spare me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to spare me, our Immortal Sword School will form an alliance with you. Even helping you take care of the Kong Heavenly Clan will be possible,&rdquo; Dugu Jianxu begged in a very pathetic manner.<br>At that moment, he did not possess the awe-inspiring might of a genius. He was truly petty and low.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Zhao Hong shot forth her palm. Her palm landed on Dugu Jianxu&rsquo;s face.<br>At that moment, Dugu Jianxu&rsquo;s complexion turned red. Then his mouth opened, and he sprayed out a mouthful of blood.<br>The next moment, his eyes rolled back, and his aura completely ceased. Dugu Jianxu was no longer living.<br>Zhao Hong had really killed Dugu Jianxu.<br>&ldquo;She actually really killed him!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; this Zhao Hong is truly ruthless.&rdquo;<br>The crowd were feeling endless fear. A change appeared in the gazes with which they looked to Chu Feng and Zhao Hong.<br>If one must describe the change, then it would be that they felt even more terrified of Chu Feng and Zhao Hong now.<br>It was one thing to think about doing something, and another thing to actually do it.<br>Over the years, there had been a lot of people that wanted to kill Dugu Jianxu. There were also many that announced they&rsquo;d kill him.<br>However, Zhao Hong was the only one to actually kill Dugu Jianxu.<br>Of course, the crowd knew very well that even though it was Zhao Hong who had killed Dugu Jianxu, the main culprit was actually Chu Feng.<br>If Chu Feng was not backing up Zhao Hong, Zhao Hong would not have been able to kill Dugu Jianxu.<br>&ldquo;Who do you want to kill next?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to ask Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;The next one will be him,&rdquo; Zhao Hong turned her gaze to the Wine-Meat Monk.<br>The Wine-Meat Monk&rsquo;s expression turned ashen. Seeing that Dugu Jianxu had been killed, he knew very well that he was in imminent peril.<br>At that moment, he simply did not dare to use his Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple to threaten Chu Feng and Zhao Hong. The reason for that was because he knew that it would be useless.<br>In a moment of desperation, he actually decided to disregard his injuries and face to directly kneel and beg, &ldquo;No, no, no, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t kill me, don&rsquo;t kill me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng had arrived before the Wine-Meat Monk with Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>Showing no quarter, Zhao Hong shot forth her palm and it ruthlessly landed on the Wine-Meat Monk&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>The Wine-Meat Monk also let out a mouthful of blood. Then, like Dugu Jianxu, his body grew powerless, and he died.<br>After killing two people in succession, Zhao Hong did not reveal the slightest intention of stopping. Furthermore, the corner of her mouth was raised into a smile of wanting to continue.<br>It must be said that even though the current Zhao Hong had the appearance of a harmless beauty, that smile had caused her nature as a demonic woman to come to light.<br>At that moment, the crowd all realized that it was not only Chu Feng who was ruthless, this woman by the name of Zhao Hong was an equally ruthless character that would not blink upon killing.<br>&ldquo;The next one is you,&rdquo; Zhao Hong looked to Zhou Fukong.<br>&ldquo;Damned bastard, what do you all take me, Zhou Fukong, as?&rdquo; Zhou Fukong shouted furiously.<br>Then, he unleashed his<br>Lightning<br>Armor,<br>Lightning<br>Wings, and Mortal level Lightning Mark.<br>Not only did he unleash all of his Heavenly Bloodline&rsquo;s power at once, but he also took out two Ancestral Armaments.<br>They was a sword and a blade. Although they were inferior to Chu Feng&rsquo;s Stormwind Edge and Flame Dragon Greatsword, the sword and blade both possessed extraordinary quality.<br>Zhou Fukong could be said to have gone all-out at once. The aura that he currently emitted was capable of suppressing everyone apart from Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Zhao Hong, did the two of you think that I, Zhou Fukong, am the same as those two pushovers?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not someone you can kill just because you want to!&rdquo; Zhou Fukong shouted angrily. He had the appearance of someone putting forth a final life and death struggle.<br>&ldquo;Oh? Is that so?&rdquo; Faced with the current Zhou Fukong, Chu Feng smiled faintly. That smile contained a faint amount of mockery.<br>Upon seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s mocking smile, Zhou Fukong&rsquo;s heart tightened once more. He felt as if his newly ignited flame had been instantly extinguished by a large basin of cold water.<br>The confidence that he had gained from unleashing all his strength was completely shattered the moment he saw Chu Feng&rsquo;s smile.<br>He suddenly felt himself to be ridiculous.<br>When even Kong Doumoyuan was no match for Chu Feng, how could he possibly be a match for Chu Feng?<br>Not to mention a life and death struggle, even injuring Chu Feng and Zhao Hong would be an extravagant hope.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Thinking of that, Zhou Fukong&rsquo;s body suddenly shifted. He was trying to escape.<br>Zhou Fukong was very wise. He knew that victory was impossible. Thus, it would be better to take this opportunity to escape.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>At the moment Zhou Fukong started escaping, a figure of lightning and an enormous axe rapidly chased after him.<br>In an instant, heaven and earth started shaking. The clouds were rolling with lightning. They were actually chasing after Zhou Fukong alongside that figure of lightning.<br>Although the clouds were ordinary black clouds, the lightning within them had nine different colors. They were exceptionally dazzling.<br>The speed of the black clouds was not at all inferior to the speed of that figure of lightning.<br>The reason for that was because the figure of lightning was Chu Feng, and the black clouds were Chu Feng&rsquo;s might. The two of them were one. As such, their speed would naturally be equally matched.<br>Although Chu Feng had not unleashed his Ancestral Armaments, he soon caught up to Zhou Fukong and stopped him.<br>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to escape,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to Zhou Fukong.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Zhou Fukong was driven into a corner. With incomparable fury, he was planning to stake his life on the line for a final battle against Chu Feng.<br>However, when he saw the Divine level Lightning Mark on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead, he was instantly terrified.<br>He did not want to be terrified. However, he was unable to control himself.<br>When he saw Chu Feng&rsquo;s Divine level Lightning Mark at such a close distance, he felt terror toward Chu Feng from the bottom his heart, from the core of his bones and the depths of his soul.<br>It was not only fear that he felt. In addition to fear was a kind of reverence. It was as if Chu Feng was his master, that he would be offending his superior should he fight Chu Feng.<br>Actually, there was an explanation for this. Regardless of whether it was the current Zhou Fukong or Kong Doumoyuan before him, they were reacting the same as a possessor of a Royal Bloodline encountering a possessor of an Imperial Bloodline, or a possessor of an Imperial Bloodline encountering a possessor of a Heavenly Bloodline when they saw the current Chu Feng.<br>Even though they were also Heavenly Bloodline possessors like Chu Feng, they trained in completely different Self-Punishing Mysterious Techniques.<br>The ones that they&rsquo;d trained in were the weakest among the Self-Punishing Mysterious Techniques, the Mortal Punishment Mysterious Techniques.<br>As for the one that Chu Feng had trained in, it was the strongest, the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>After training in the Self-Punishing Mysterious Techniques, their bloodlines would be transformed.<br>After Chu Feng unleashed his Lightning Mark, his enormously powerful bloodline was completely revealed.<br>It would be one thing for those with strength surpassing Chu Feng. However, for Zhou Fukong and Kong Doumoyuan, who possessed strength equal to Chu Feng, they would not be able to contend against Chu Feng.<br>The reason for that was because they had lost to Chu Feng fundamentally.<br>This was why regardless of how robust or fierce a hound might be, they would remain a dog.<br>Regardless of how powerful that hound might be, when faced with a fierce tiger or a lion, it will immediately lose the will to battle and would only try to flee in disarray.<br>That was the sort of suppression that originated from the depths of one&rsquo;s bloodline, a fundamental distinction.<br><br></p></div>
