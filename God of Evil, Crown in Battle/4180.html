        <div> - No Choice But To Concede<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the reaction from Long Shengbu, Long Nanxun became even more pleased with himself.<br>However, Long Xiaoxiao did not give the two genius world spiritists a good evaluation. In fact, she didn&rsquo;t even bother to look at them.<br>As for Chu Feng, he was unfamiliar with the structure of the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>The All-heaven Heavenly Master, Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted and that Lu Jie were all people that he had heard about.<br>But, Chu Feng had never heard of those two genius world spiritists or their masters.<br>&ldquo;Whilst they are indeed quite famous, I wonder if their fame is well-deserved or not,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao mocked.<br>Whilst the two genius world spiritists looked down on Chu Feng, Long Xiaoxiao also looked down on them.<br>&ldquo;Two brothers, teach this kid a lesson.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let Xiaoxiao know who really has true abilities,&rdquo; Long Nanxun said as he pointed at Chu Feng.<br>Long Nanxun disliked Chu Feng to begin with. He was itching for someone to teach him a ruthless lesson.<br>Thus, after saying those words, he looked at the fair-skinned playboy and the dark-skinned fatty.<br>The fair-skinned playboy by the name of Chen Guang understood his intentions. Thus, he immediately stepped forward.<br>&ldquo;Brother, I&rsquo;ve heard that you&rsquo;re also a world spiritist at rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To obtain such an accomplishment at such a young age, besides possessing exceptional talent, you must also have a renowned master providing you with guidance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;May I know who brother&rsquo;s master is?&rdquo; asked Chen Guang.<br>&ldquo;I do not have a master,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No master?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s answer not only surprised Chen Guang, it also surprised the others present.<br>However, soon, a mocking smile appeared on their faces.<br>&ldquo;In that case, it would mean that brother is a self-made genius. That&rsquo;s truly remarkable&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come, brother. Allow me to experience exactly how strong your world spirit techniques are.&rdquo;<br>As Chen Guang spoke, he began to set up a spirit formation. Soon, he was finished.<br>What he had created was a very exquisite protective formation.<br>It had taken Chen Guang only half an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time to complete his spirit formation.<br>From this, it could be seen that he was indeed quite capable.<br>The people present were all able to tell how powerful Chen Guang&rsquo;s spirit formation was.<br>Unavoidably, some praises were heard.<br>This made Chen Guang even more pleased with himself.<br>&ldquo;Brother, you can set up a spirit formation in half an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time. If your spirit formation is capable of breaching this defensive formation of mine, it means that your attainments in world spirit techniques are stronger than mine,&rdquo; said Chen Guang.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Chu Feng agreed. With that, he planned to set up his spirit formation.<br>However, once he began, he was immediately stunned.<br>Chu Feng had underestimated the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk.<br>The Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk had been in Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit space and steadily devouring his spirit power the entire time.<br>Without spirit power, Chu Feng would not be able to form spirit formations.<br>Chu Feng thought about putting a halt to the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk to regain his spirit power, however, he was shocked to discover that he was actually unable to put a halt to the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk.<br>This was completely unexpected.<br>If Chu Feng could not stop the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk, he would not be able to utilize any spirit power to set up a spirit formation. No matter how outstanding his abilities might be, he would not be able to put them to use.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was not releasing his spirit power after so long, and that he even had an awkward expression on his face, Long Xiaoxiao asked, &ldquo;Little benefactor, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your Highness, I am truly sorry.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am currently fusing with a world spiritist treasure in my world spirit space. Because of that, my spirit power has been sealed. I am unable to use any world spirit techniques,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What? Unable to use any world spirit techniques?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re unable to use any world spirit techniques, why are you here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You damned scammer! I knew you were deceiving Xiaoxiao! Watch how I&rsquo;ll tear you to shreds!&rdquo; As Long Nanxun spoke, he planned to attack Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You dare?!&rdquo;<br>However, before Long Nanxun could do anything, Long Xiaoxiao glared at him fiercely.<br>Faced with Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s anger-filled gaze, Long Nanxun immediately cowered. No matter how much he disliked Chu Feng, he did not dare to attack him.<br>He ended up retrieving his clenched fist in a very displeased manner, and then glared at Chu Feng again.<br>&ldquo;Nanxun, Princess Xiaoxiao and I have personally witnessed young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques. He is definitely not a scammer.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since he says he&rsquo;s fusing with a world spiritist treasure, he must be doing that,&rdquo; added Long Shengbu.<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re fusing with a world spiritist treasure, why didn&rsquo;t you say so earlier? Why did you agree to the contest?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he deliberately trying to embarrass Xiaoxiao here?&rdquo; said Long Nanxun.<br>&ldquo;Shut your mouth! I&rsquo;m the one that's going to embarass you!&rdquo; shouted Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;I...&rdquo;<br>Long Nanxun turned red with anger. However, he didn&rsquo;t dare to explode at Long Xiaoxiao. As such, he ended up glaring angrily at Chu Feng again.<br>&ldquo;It is my fault. I thought that I could put a stop to the process at any time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Never did I imagine that this world spiritist treasure can't be forcibly stopped,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Nonsense. When has there ever been a case where one cannot forcibly stop the fusing process with a world spiritist treasure?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s simply unheard of.&rdquo;<br>The fair-skinned playboy Chen Guang and the dark-skinned fatty Yue Yang both refuted Chu Feng.<br>Their intentions were clear; they were stating that Chu Feng was lying.<br>But, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know how to explain things.<br>After all, in normal cases, a world spiritist could indeed put a stop to the process at any time.<br>That was something that all world spiritists knew. It was simply common knowledge.<br>It was precisely because it was common knowledge that Chu Feng had neglected it.<br>&ldquo;Your Highness, I am truly sorry.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, I am sorry.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, was careless.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart was filled with guilt and shame.<br>Long Xiaoxiao had placed high hopes on him, and Long Shengbu also thought highly of him.<br>If that wasn&rsquo;t the case, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a contest of world spiritist techniques.<br>Although the current outcome was not what he had intended, it still greatly embarrassed Long Xiaoxiao and Long Shengbu.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng felt extremely guilty.<br>&ldquo;Little benefactor, in that case, how long will it take for your treasure to finish fusing?&rdquo; asked Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;This world spiritist treasure has surpassed my expectations. As such, even I am uncertain,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Uncertain? What a great excuse,&rdquo; mocked Long Nanxun.<br>&ldquo;It is understandable that you&rsquo;re unable to use your world spirit techniques.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the strength of a world spiritist is actually embodied through the strength of their world spirits.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, powerful world spirits will only follow powerful masters.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about this. Brother, allow this Yue Yang to compete with you,&rdquo; said the dark-skinned fatty.<br>As he spoke, he activated his world spirit gate.<br>Soon, a world spirit emerged from the world spirit gate.<br>It was a male world spirit. He had a tall and robust build, and a handsome and grim appearance.<br>Most importantly, he emitted a very powerful aura.<br>That was a rank one Utmost Exalted-level world spirit.<br>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s also an Asura World Spiritist?&rsquo;<br>Chu Feng recognized right away that the world spirit was an Asura World Spirit.<br>After all, only an Asura World Spirit would possess that sort of aura and airs.<br>&ldquo;Competing in world spirits? That&rsquo;s a great proposal.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little benefactor, call out your world spirit and teach him a lesson,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao said with a look of expectation.<br>She was not the only one. Even Long Shengbu had an expectant gaze.<br>Even though they had witnessed Chu Feng&rsquo;s martial cultivation talent and world spirit techniques, they had not yet seen his world spirits.<br>They wanted to know exactly what sort of world spirits Chu Feng possessed.<br>&ldquo;Regarding that, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to compete in that either,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with embarrassment.<br>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t compete in this either? Don&rsquo;t you tell me your world spirits are all in closed-door training, and thus you&rsquo;re unable to call them,&rdquo; said Yue Yang.<br>&ldquo;That just so happens to be the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with embarrassment.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, even Long Shengbu and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er were feeling embarrassed.<br>&ldquo;Little benefactor, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly be doing this on purpose, right?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao looked to Chu Feng with suspicion.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m truly not doing this on purpose. It&rsquo;s simply that the timing of things are just bad,&rdquo; said Chu Feng helplessly.<br>Due to special reasons, Chu Feng had only ever had three world spirits in his world spirit space.<br>Xue Ji had long departed his world spirit space. She had then ended up being captured by the Old Cat.<br>As for Her Lady Queen, she had entered closed-door training and hadn't woken up since they'd found the Asura God Stone.<br>As for Yu Sha, she had entered closed-door training in the Reincarnation Upper Realm and still hadn't woken up either.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, I&rsquo;m not going to say anything this time around.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You tell me, what are we to do about this?&rdquo; said Long Nanxun.<br>&ldquo;My apologies Princess, my apologies Lord Supreme Elder.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, am incompetent this time around. I admit defeat,&rdquo; said Chu Feng helplessly.<br>He had wanted to use the opportunity to help Long Daozhi return to the Dragon Clan.<br>Never did he expect to end up failing so much at such a crucial time.<br>With the situation as it was, Chu Feng did not wish to make things difficult for Long Xiaoxiao, and thus decided to concede.<br></p></div>
