        <h1>Chapter 5576: You Refuse to Submit?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Chu Feng walked through the barrier and saw the true form of the palace.</span><br><span>He was immediately met with a massive atrium. Deep in the atrium, there was a long passageway that extended far beyond what his eyes could see.</span><br><span>It would appear that the trial was awaiting him there.</span><br><span>Both the atrium and the long passageway were made out of simple rock tiles. It looked impressive, though it wasn&rsquo;t particularly extravagant.</span><br><span>Little Fishy was waiting for him by the door, but surprisingly, Jie Tian was lurking around as well. He seemed to be waiting for him too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother, are you fine?&rdquo; Little Fishy rushed forward and asked upon seeing that </span><span>Chu Feng was a little weak.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. I had a problem passing through the barrier because I didn&rsquo;t undergo the trial,&rdquo; Chu Feng explained. &ldquo;Your formation armor has been neutralized?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng realized that Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> formation armor had lost its powers; it was only emanating her own aura now.</span><br><span>&ldquo;My formation armor lost its powers after I entered,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng quickly inspected his own Cosmos Sack, where he had placed the eighteen formation armors inside. As he had expected, the eighteen formation armors had been rendered useless too, as if someone had siphoned away the spirit power in them.</span><br><span>The cause must have been the barrier they had passed through earlier.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Feeling afraid now that you don&rsquo;t have your formation armor to fall back on?&rdquo; Jie Tian sneered.</span><br><span>Before Chu Feng could answer, Little Fishy scoffed coldly, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you the one who should be afraid now that you don&rsquo;t have your formation armor?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Confidence beamed from her face as she said those words. They could only rely on their own capabilities now since there were no formation armors or restrictions here, which put her at a greater advantage since she could now fight with her martial power.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend on crossing blows with you. Let&rsquo;s put aside our enmity and join hands for now. Otherwise, all of us will die if we don&rsquo;t accomplish the mission,&rdquo; Jie Tian said.</span><br><span>He was not a fool. He knew that working together with Chu Feng and Little Fishy was his best bet at surviving this ordeal.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Not necessarily so,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Not necessarily so? What are you referring to?&rdquo; Jie Tian asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We might not necessarily die even if we fail this mission,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Jie Tian snorted. He looked at Chu Feng as if he was a countryside bumpkin and said, &ldquo;What makes you certain of that? Is it because Chaotic Era Scholar entered this place through your body? Or that he protected you from me? What naivety! You don&rsquo;t know what kind of person he is at all!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t won Jie Tian&rsquo;s respect even though he had defeated the latter with the eighteen formation armors.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you understand him then?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand him either, but he&rsquo;s more vicious than you can imagine. He was the strongest world spiritist in the Ancient Era, one of the loftiest figures in the world of cultivation. How could someone who&rsquo;s reached such heights possibly be soft-hearted?&rdquo; Jie Tian asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether he&rsquo;s soft-hearted, but the fact that you called him the strongest world spiritist of the Ancient Era already tells me that you don&rsquo;t know much about the Ancient Era,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Jie Tian&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about how vicious he is. Why are you saying that I don&rsquo;t know much about the Ancient Era? There&rsquo;s no link between the two!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I just thought it&rsquo;s embarrassing how you pretended to be knowledgeable despite not knowing much. Oh, am I not allowed to point that out? Are the people from the Seven </span><span>Realms Sacred Mansion so weak-hearted that they can&rsquo;t take criticism?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Jie Tian furiously glared at Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Uwa</span><span>!</span><br><span>All of a sudden, Jie Tian grabbed his head and squatted down with a pained expression. Neither Chu Feng nor Little Fishy was surprised to see that. The formation that Chaotic Era Scholar had planted in them to prevent them from killing one another must have taken effect.</span><br><span>However, Jie Tian quickly adjusted his emotions and recovered from that. He stood back up, though he dared not look at Chu Feng anymore. He was afraid that the sight of the latter would stoke his killing intent, resulting in instant punishment from the formation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to waste my breath. The main point is that we need to join hands to survive this ordeal. We&rsquo;ll have to cooperate with one another. I have the most experience with places like this, so the two of you better&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Listen to you? Dream on,&rdquo; Little Fishy interjected before Jie Tian could finish his words.</span><br><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>.&rdquo; Jie Tian looked at Little Fishy. &ldquo;Stop being so narrow-minded and consider the bigger picture. Now is not the time for you to throw a childish tantrum.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with following your orders either,&rdquo; Chu Feng added.</span><br><span>Jie Tian&rsquo;s face darkened, but that only made him more fearful of looking at Chu Feng. He turned his gaze toward the passageway and said with gritted teeth, &ldquo;Very well. The two of you can do whatever you want since you have already set your minds to die.&rdquo;</span><br><span>With that, he began making his way toward the passageway.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that fellow acting so arrogantly for? Big brother, shall I teach him a lesson in your stead?&rdquo; Little Fishy walked over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side and spoke aloud.</span><br><span>Jie Tian immediately halted his footsteps upon hearing those words.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Teach me a lesson? Give it a try then. Let&rsquo;s see if the formation will punish you for making a move on me,&rdquo; Jie Tian sneered.</span><br><span>Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> eyes turned cold, but Chu Feng spoke up before she could respond, &ldquo;Jie Tian, do you earnestly think that I&rsquo;ll ignore our earlier grudges just because we are currently restrained by this formation?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng slowly made his way toward Jie Tian as he spoke.</span><br><span>Worried for Chu Feng, Little Fishy quickly followed him. Jie Tian was stronger than Chu Feng, after all. It would be dangerous if Jie Tian found a way to endure the formation&rsquo;s punishment to kill him.</span><br><span>Chu Feng walked right up to Jie Tian and glared at him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;First and foremost, your presence here is inconsequential. You shouldn&rsquo;t even think that we won&rsquo;t be able to clear this trial without you. However, I am an understanding person. Since that elder wants us to work together to clear the trial, I can temporarily put aside our grudges and work together with you.</span><br><span>&ldquo;But you shouldn&rsquo;t even think about attempting anything; I won&rsquo;t let it go. If you truly wish to survive this ordeal, you better unconditionally follow my instructions from this point onward,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Follow your instructions? Are you worthy?&rdquo; Jie Tian scoffed in disdain. He didn&rsquo;t think highly about Chu Feng in the first place, so how could he possibly follow the latter&rsquo;s instructions?</span><br><span>Chu Feng laughed. &ldquo;You seem unwilling.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course I am unwilling! You&rsquo;re nothing but a despicable rascal who pulled one over me while I was unprepared. I was the one who created the formation armors that you used against me! What are you capable of that deserves my respect?&rdquo; Jie Tian asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s smile turned a little twisted.</span><br><span>That smile made Jie Tian shudder, though he didn&rsquo;t lose his nerves. An idea came to his mind. He pointed his finger straight at Chu Feng&rsquo;s face and provocatively said, &ldquo;Who do you think you are to make me listen to you? I&rsquo;ll never heed the words of trash like you. What are you going to do about it? Beat me up?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Pah!</span><br><span>A tight slap fell on Jie Tian&rsquo;s cheek. It was from Chu Feng.</span><br><span>That slap was hardly strong enough to hurt Jie Tian, but it was extremely humiliating. It angered Jie Tian, and his killing intent surged once more.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You bastard!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Gah!</span><br><span>Jie Tian clutched his head as he collapsed onto the floor. The formation&rsquo;s punishment hurt so much that his body convulsed.</span><br><span>Chu Feng used this opportunity to kick Jie Tian&rsquo;s face, causing the latter to twirl across the room. He then proceeded to beat up Jie Tian, which further infuriated the latter, but that only intensified his punishment from the formation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Damn it&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Tian clenched his fists tightly. Veins could be seen popping from his arms. It was hard to tell whether he was angry or in pain. It took a while, but he finally calmed down.</span><br><span>However, Chu Feng walked over and kicked his face once more, sending him flying across the air. Naturally, Jie Tian&rsquo;s killing intent flared once more, but that caused him to be punished by the formation yet again.</span><br><span>Left with no choice, Jie Tian could only suppress his killing intent.</span><br><span>Just as he suppressed his killing intent and recovered from the formation&rsquo;s punishment, Chu Feng appeared in front of him again.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You bastard!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Tian quickly constructed a protective formation to shield himself. He figured that he could at least defend himself even if he couldn&rsquo;t attack the latter.</span><br><span>Gah!</span><br><span>But before he could form his protective formation, he was struck with an excruciating pang of pain that made him crumble to his knees. He couldn&rsquo;t even put up a protective formation against Chu Feng!</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to defend against me?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng grabbed Jie Tian up by his hair and sent three kicks toward his face. This further infuriated Jie Tian, which put him through greater suffering due to the </span><span>restriction formation. It took him a long time before he finally calmed down once more.</span><br><span>But as soon as the formation&rsquo;s torture stopped, Chu Feng walked up to him once more. Unable to bear it anymore, Jie Tian raised his hands and begged for mercy, &ldquo;Stop, stop! Stop hitting me, please! I admit defeat, all right? I&rsquo;ll listen to you from now on!&rdquo;</span><br><span>He was so indignant that his voice sounded like sobs, and there were even tears in his eyes.</span></p></div>
