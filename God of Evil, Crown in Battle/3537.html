        <h1>Chapter 3536</h1>
        <div> - Terrifying Existence<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Wang Qiang.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng immediately rushed toward Wang Qiang upon seeing him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, careful,&rdquo; however, before Chu Feng could reach Wang Qiang, he was stopped by the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, I know him,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Hearing those words, many people turned their eyes to him.<br>Evidently, the crowd were surprised by his words.<br>&ldquo;Bunch of trash, what makes you all think you&rsquo;re qualified to come and snatch my treasures?&rdquo;<br>Wang Qiang spoke with the same voice as usual. However, his tone became very strange.<br>Furthermore, even though he had clearly managed to see Chu Feng, he ignored him completely. It was as if he didn&rsquo;t recognize Chu Feng at all.<br>&ldquo;Wang Qiang, what happened to you? Do you not recognize me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;How could trash like yourselves possibly know me?&rdquo; Wang Qiang took a glance at Chu Feng with contempt.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, it would appear that you&rsquo;re mistaking him for someone else,&rdquo; said the crowd.<br>Tantai Yinjian, as the strongest expert present, had already walked forward. He arrived at the forefront of the vast group of people and stood opposite Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;You are but a person of the younger generation, yet you dare to insult us like this. You&rsquo;re truly lacking in social etiquette, no?&rdquo; said Tantai Yinjian.<br>&ldquo;There are indeed a lot of people of the younger generation present. However, it is not me. Instead, it is you all,&rdquo; Wang Qiang revealed a mocking smile.<br>Furthermore, he was looking at Tantai Yinjian with eyes filled with contempt.<br>His gaze and his attitude caused Tantai Yinjian to feel extremely displeased.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that if you are not taught a lesson, you will not know how to speak.&rdquo;<br>As his words resounded, Tantai Yinjian&rsquo;s oppressive might swept forth.<br>The oppressive might of a rank nine Exalted instantly covered the entire region. Like an invisible army of thousands of men and horses, it rushed forth to suppress Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;You~~~&rdquo;<br>In the very next moment, Tantai Yinjian&rsquo;s expression changed enormously. His gaze turned lifeless from shock.<br>It turned out that there seemed to be an invisible barrier around Wang Qiang. Tantai Yinjian&rsquo;s oppressive might was simply unable to breach the barrier at all, much less harm Wang Qiang.<br>Tantai Yinjian was not the only person who discovered this. Many people among the crowd also discovered this.<br>At that moment, the crowd all started to tremble with fear.<br>They realized that the person before them was likely not a person of the younger generation. Instead, he was a monster.<br>&ldquo;Humph. Trash like you dare to attack me?&rdquo;<br>Faced with the trembling crowd, the corners of Wang Qiang&rsquo;s mouth rose into a cold smile. Then, he waved his arm.<br>Following that, a muffled explosion was heard. Tantai Yinjian was knocked flying away. By the time he landed, his body was completely mutilated.<br>Although he was still alive, he was no longer able to move. Without a doubt, the strongest person amongst the vast group of experts had been seriously injured.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, there was an intense amount of fear in the crowd&rsquo;s eyes as they looked to Wang Qiang.<br>Even though they had anticipated that the youngster before them was very powerful, they did not imagine him to be that powerful. A casual attack from him nearly took Tantai Yinjian&rsquo;s life.<br>One must know that Tantai Yinjian was a peak Exalted-level expert. He was only a step away from becoming an Utmost Exalted.<br>Yet, the young man before them was able to seriously injure him. This meant that his cultivation had most definitely surpassed the Exalted realm.<br>He was an extremely powerful monster, so powerful that the crowd present were unable to measure his strength.<br>&ldquo;You all need not be afraid. It is that trash that spoke rudely toward me. That is why I decided to teach him a lesson.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for you all, although you are also trash, I cannot drive you out completely uncalled for, much less cause you harm completely uncalled for. Otherwise, others will say that I am bullying the young.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, I am truly disappointed for there to not be any capable members of the younger generations,&rdquo; Wang Qiang suddenly sighed. He was sighing like an old man, even though he had the appearance of a young man.<br>Faced with the strange behavior from the youth before them, the crowd began to wonder if he was an old monster that had lived for many years.<br>&ldquo;Please excuse this junior&rsquo;s offense. Senior, exactly who are you, and what relationship do you have with the Void Sacred Tree?&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief stood forth. He not only clasped his fist respectfully at Wang Qiang, but he even addressed himself as &lsquo;junior.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Youngster, although you are also trash, you understand etiquette.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who I am is not important. What&rsquo;s important is that you all have encountered an extremely rare opportunity. Originally, this was supposed to be your fortune, your stroke of luck. Unfortunately&hellip; you all are simply too weak. If I am to allow you to explore on your own, you will likely not be able to gain anything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I am disappointed, there is nothing that I can do about it.&rdquo; Wang Qiang sighed, then said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you all a bit.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Wang Qiang slowly raised his palm. A ray of light appeared in his palm. That light was white, and contained spirit power. Furthermore&hellip; lightning was surging within it.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Wang Qiang lifted his arm up high.<br>Following that, an enormous ray of light appeared above the vast crowd. The light shot straight down.<br>After that light disappeared, the people enveloped by the light all disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Before the crowd could react, Wang Qiang was acting up again.<br>Another ray of light shot down. The people that were enveloped by that ray of light also disappeared.<br>Seeing such a scene, many people grew extremely afraid. After all, no one knew what that terrifyingly powerful fellow did to those people that had disappeared.<br>It would be one thing if he had only captured them and sent them somewhere. However&hellip; what if he had directly killed them?<br>Thinking of this, many people, due to their fear of death, turned around with the intention to flee from this terrifying fellow.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after those people tried to escape, light appeared above them and enveloped all of them. As the light disappeared, they too disappeared.<br>Following that, many rays of light continued to descend. In an instant, the vast crowd composed of people from many powers had practically all disappeared.<br>There was only a single person left - Chu Feng.<br>Both Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were standing in midair and looking at one another. However, neither of them showed the same sort of brotherly feeling from the past.<br>Chu Feng was looking at Wang Qiang with a gaze filled with caution.<br>As for Wang Qiang, he did not say anything. However, he was looking at Chu Feng with a slightly strange gaze.<br>&ldquo;Who are you? What did you do to my friend?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>As matters stood, Chu Feng also felt that the person before him was likely no longer Wang Qiang. Perhaps Wang Qiang had provoked something in the Void Sacred Tree, and had his body controlled by that thing.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; However, Wang Qiang did not only not answer Chu Feng, but the corners of his mouth instead rose into a strange curve.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, he raised his arm, and a ray of light appeared above Chu Feng. Before Chu Feng could dodge the light, the ray of light enveloped him.<br></p></div>
