        <h1>Chapter 3054</h1>
        <div> - Li Ruochu<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What others will do is their business. It does not mean that our Li Heavenly Clan should act like others,&rdquo; That old man said.<br>&ldquo;Humph, you are truly soft-hearted,&rdquo; The old lady was extremely displeased. She then turned to those eight people of the younger generation, &ldquo;What are you all standing there for? Quickly, enter it.&rdquo;<br>Right after that old lady said those words, that old man said, &ldquo;Wait! Since when has this old man allowed you all to enter?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the old lady grew furious. She shouted at the old man, &ldquo;Exactly what are you trying to do?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations are to enter it and destroy the main formation, they will only be able to slow the opening of the Upper Realm Gate, and will be unable to close it. Thus, the two Upper Realms becoming connected is inevitable. No one will be able to change it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, you having them enter it is simply superfluous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, we will have to wait for Lord Clan Chief to decide if we will actually wage war against the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. You do not have the authority to decide this matter,&rdquo; The old man said.<br>&ldquo;If we are to miss the opportunity to invade the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, are you capable of taking responsibility?&rdquo; The old lady asked.<br>&ldquo;This old man will take responsibility,&rdquo; The old man said.<br>&ldquo;Bullshit, you are incapable of taking responsibility,&rdquo; The old lady actually cursed out loud. It would appear that she was truly enraged by the old man.<br>Then, she looked to the eight people of the younger generation again. She said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said it already, go in there and prevent the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations from destroying the Upper Realm Gate&rsquo;s main formation! Are you all deaf or what?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; At that moment, those eight people of the younger generation looked to that old man and revealed difficult expressions on their faces.<br>After all, both the old lady and the old man were their Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elders. They were both people that they did not wish to offend.<br>&ldquo;Let us not make things difficult for the children. Since we are unable to make a decision on this matter, let us have all the elders vote on the decision.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those who agree to enter the Upper Realm Gate shall step forward. The decision shall go with the majority,&rdquo; The old man seemed to not want to place those eight people of the younger generation in a difficult situation, and thus came to such a decision.<br>After saying those words, ninety percent of the elders that were kneeling behind him and the old lady actually took a step forward.<br>It turned out that only ten percent of the elders felt that they should not enter the Upper Realm Gate.<br>&ldquo;Haha, what else do you have to say now?&rdquo; Seeing this, the old lady was immediately overjoyed.<br>As for the old man, he revealed a displeased expression. Sighing very helplessly, he said, &ldquo;You all, you&rsquo;re truly foolish.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lady Supreme Elder, if we are to encounter the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, how shall we handle them?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the man with the strongest strength among the eight people of the younger generation turned to ask the old lady.<br>&ldquo;Battle is imminent. There is no need to be lenient. If you are to encounter the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, kill them,&rdquo; The old lady said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; The old man said.<br>&ldquo;Follow my order!&rdquo; The old lady shouted.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Milady.&rdquo; The eight people of the younger generations clasped their fists and answered in unison.<br>After those elders made their opinions regarding the matter clear, the eight people of the younger generation all unilaterally decided to listen to the old lady&rsquo;s orders when faced with a decision between the two Supreme Elders&rsquo; orders.<br>&ldquo;You all&hellip; you&rsquo;re all fools,&rdquo; Seeing this, the old man became extremely displeased.<br>The eight people of the younger generation hesitated no more. One by one, they leapt into the air and flew toward the Upper Realm Gate.<br>&ldquo;If you all are to encounter the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, beating them back is enough. Do not kill them.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a female voice suddenly sounded from nearby.<br>Looking toward the voice, the crowd saw that a woman was standing nearby.<br>That woman was wearing a long red skirt. She had a head of long black hair. Her hair was so long that it reached the end of her skirt, and was fluttering in the air together with her skirt.<br>That woman was extremely beautiful. Before her, all of the other beauties present lost their splendor.<br>If one were to pay close attention, one would notice that this woman&rsquo;s appearance resembled Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s.<br>&ldquo;Li Ruochu, who are you to disobey my order?!&rdquo; Seeing the woman standing in the air, the old lady spoke in a very displeased manner.<br>It turned out that that woman was Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s older sister, Li Ruochu.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this junior would not dare to go against your order. Merely, I wish to urge you to reconsider.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although the two Upper Realms will be connected soon, it is still uncertain as to whether we will become friends or enemies with the Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you decide to have our clan&rsquo;s younger generation kill the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations from the very start, wouldn&rsquo;t that indicate to them that we are determined to wage war against their Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; Li Ruochu said.<br>&ldquo;So what if we are to wage war against them? How could our Li Heavenly Clan possibly fear their Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; The old lady spoke with contempt.<br>&ldquo;Senior, how could you be so certain that our Li Heavenly Clan would be able to defeat the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not mentioning the fact that Chu Hanxian has merely disappeared, and that it is still undetermined whether he has died or not, that Chu Xuanyuan should still be alive, no?&rdquo; Li Ruochu said.<br>Once Li Ruochu said those words, the expressions of the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations did not change. However, the elders present all revealed, to a greater or lesser degree, fear on their faces.<br>Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan were not only renowned in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm; they were also renowned for their might in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>At that moment, the old man added, &ldquo;Actually, what this old man is worried about are precisely those two people.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph, how could you all fear a person who has died for many years, and some trash that has been expelled and imprisoned by the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; The old lady spoke with contempt.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this junior has already reminded you all. As for the decision of what to do, you still have the final say,&rdquo; Li Ruochu spoke with a light smile on her face.<br>Hearing those words, the old lady revealed a very displeased expression. However, in the end, she waved her sleeve and said, &ldquo;Forget about it. If you all are to encounter the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, beating them back would suffice. They can go back and report to their Chu Heavenly Clan that they cannot match our Li Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, Milady,&rdquo; The eight people of the younger generation answered in unison. Then, they continued to fly toward the Upper Realm Gate.<br></p></div>
