        <h1>Chapter 5741: Call Him Hubby Instead</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The square was so silent that the only sound that could be heard was </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> nuzzling in Chu Feng&rsquo;s arms. Everyone was stunned, be it man or woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> was the goddess of countless men, </span><span>Xianhao</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> would be the god of countless women. Why were the two of them diving into Chu Feng&rsquo;s embrace? Was he even worthy of this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This had to be a lie, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only till another voice sounded that they shook out of their daze and came to terms that this was reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big brother, are you insane?&rdquo; Little Fishy grabbed </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu&rsquo;s</span><span> ears and angrily dragged him out of Chu Feng&rsquo;s arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hear my explanation, little sister! I&rsquo;m not in that kind of relationship with Chu Feng!&rdquo; </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Pui</span><span>! Stay away from my big brother Chu Feng. If you dare do this again, I&rsquo;ll tell everyone about your depraved reading materials!&rdquo; Little Fishy pouted as she twisted her brother&rsquo;s ears with one hand and placed the other on her slim waist. She looked really angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xianhao</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> quickly clasped Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> mouth and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, my little sister. What do you mean by depraved reading materials?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His explanation piqued everyone&rsquo;s curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd turned to look at Chu Feng and the others once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little Fishy hurled </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> aside, walked up to Chu Feng, turned to face Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> and Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span>, and politely asked, &ldquo;Big brother, are these two big sisters your friends?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Little Fishy, let me introduce you to them. This is Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> from the Totem Dragon Clan, and this is her younger brother, Long Chengyu. As for this lady, she is Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span>. We are both from the Eastern Region, and we have known each other for many years,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hehe! Miss </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>, I have long heard you&rsquo;re as beautiful as a fairy, but the rumors are understating your beauty now that I&rsquo;m seeing you in the flesh. You&rsquo;re simply too beautiful!&rdquo; Long Chengyu scratched his head while grinning like a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was embarrassed despite his usual rowdy and brazen personality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little Fishy responded to Long Chengyu with a polite smile before turning back to Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> and Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> and saying, &ldquo;Big sisters, you&rsquo;re my big brother&rsquo;s friends, and that makes you my friends too. Come, why don&rsquo;t we have a chat over there?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> replied with a sweet smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> responded with a slight nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big brother, come with us.&rdquo; Even though she was inviting Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> and Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span>, Little Fishy grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm and dragged him toward her residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Little sister, why are you taking him away? It has been a long time since I last met Brother Chu Feng. We ought to have a good chat too!&rdquo; </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> exclaimed with a frantic wave of his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Cut the crap! Come with us if you want to chat. Or would you prefer that we talk about your depraved reading choices here?&rdquo; Little Fishy shot a disdainful glance at </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> heaved a sigh. He turned to Long Chengyu and said, &ldquo;Come with us.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Chengyu was a bit frightened of </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> as there was a conflict between them, but he accepted the latter&rsquo;s offer with a nod, saying, &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the crowd&rsquo;s incredulous stares, the group of them made their way </span><span>to</span><span> Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with his luck? How did he come to get acquainted with </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> and </span><span>Xianhao</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>? And what did he call </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> earlier? Little Fishy? That&rsquo;s too intimate! Did you see how </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm earlier? Isn&rsquo;t she afraid of dirtying her hands?&rdquo; Qin Shu gritted her teeth in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What does grabbing his arm count as? She dived right into Chu Feng&rsquo;s arms. You didn&rsquo;t see that?&rdquo; Qin Xuan asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Of course</span><span> I did! I just don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo; Qin Shu&rsquo;s eyes reddened in envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like they are really on close terms,&rdquo; Qin Xuan said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was hardly anyone in the world of cultivation who didn&rsquo;t know about Chu Feng&rsquo;s bad blood with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. It was one thing for Long Chengyu to do so, but </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> and </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s</span><span> earlier actions clearly indicated that they were siding with Chu Feng too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, this matter still needed further verification. They would have to wait for the prodigies from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to make a move first to confirm </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> and </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s</span><span> stances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big brother, are we going to let Chu Feng go just like that? Do I have to watch him strut around the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith?&rdquo; Qin Shu asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn&rsquo;t wait to deal with Chu Feng, especially after seeing how intimate </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> was with the latter. This should have been a stage for him to shine, but Chu Feng was hogging all the attention. How could he accept this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t going to let Chu Feng off the hook, but don&rsquo;t make a reckless move yet,&rdquo; Qin Xuan said before taking his leave, leaving Qin Shu to continue staring at </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s</span><span> residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng and the others entered Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little Fishy took out a teapot and steeped some tea for Chu Feng and the others. She poured a cup of tea and gently blew on it before serving it to Chu Feng, saying, &ldquo;Big brother, have a taste. My tea tastes amazing.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked no different from a virtuous wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Chengyu&rsquo;s eyes widened at that sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Mm, it tastes great,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a thumbs up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Little Fishy smiled sweetly after receiving Chu Feng&rsquo;s compliment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did she proceed to serve tea to the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big sister </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span>, have some tea. Big sister </span><span>Muxi</span><span>, have some tea.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> and Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> received their respective teacups, Long Chengyu&rsquo;s posture noticeably straightened up. He had already thought of what he was going to say after receiving his teacup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his disappointment, Little Fishy settled down beside Chu Feng before turning to </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> and Long Chengyu. &ldquo;Feel free, the two of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Chengyu was rendered speechless. He had a feeling he was being discriminated against.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> was already used to it. He poured a cup of tea for himself. Before taking a sip, he glanced at Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, </span><span>I&rsquo;m benefiting from your halo. This is my first time tasting my little sister&rsquo;s tea.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You are full of nonsense.&rdquo; Little Fishy directed an eye roll in </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu&rsquo;s</span><span> direction while topping up Chu Feng&rsquo;s teacup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beautiful people looked impeccable no matter what they did. Even her eye roll was adorable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like you two siblings are on very close terms,&rdquo; Xian </span><span>Miamiao</span><span> remarked with a sweet smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s on close terms with him? I&rsquo;m only on close terms with my big brother!&rdquo; Little Fishy turned to Chu Feng with a beaming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Enough, enough. Why don&rsquo;t you just call him hubby straight?&rdquo; </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span>, Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span>, and Long Chengyu were taken aback. They hadn&rsquo;t expected </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> to be so direct. This wasn&rsquo;t a joke to be taken lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Much to their surprise, Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> face turned as red as an apple. She became so nervous that she couldn&rsquo;t even utter a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her expression, Long Chengyu&rsquo;s eyeballs nearly popped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To alleviate the awkwardness, Chu Feng quickly stepped in and said, &ldquo;Stop your teasing for a moment. There&rsquo;s something important I need to ask you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> and Little Fishy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The two of you arrived here early. Have you met the Divine Body Realm&rsquo;s Wang Qiang?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to verify if the Wang Qiang here was the Wang Qiang he knew.</span></p></div>
