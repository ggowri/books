        <h1>Chapter 1711</h1>
        <div> - Enormous Change<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Although Chu Feng did not kill the disciples from the Jadewater Temple and Firerain Hall who knelt and admitted their mistakes, he did not let them leave. Instead, he imprisoned them within his spirit formation.<br>As all the people here were of the from the younger generation, Chu Feng felt that there was no one who could break through his spirit formations. After a certain amount of time passed, this spirit formation would automatically disperse. At that time, the disciples from the Firerain Hall and the Jadewater Temple would all be released.<br>However, Chu Feng would likely have already left Mooncloud City by then. Thus, he would naturally not be afraid that they would report him.<br>As for the Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s disciples, regardless of how deep the hatred between them and Chu Feng might have have been in the past, it remained that Chu Feng had saved them today. If they were to report him, Chu Feng will definitely not be courteous toward them the next time he met them.<br>Furthermore, Jiang Furong was also present. Chu Feng believed that Jiang Furong would not allow them to report him.<br>&ldquo;I urge you all to not continue onward. There is only a single spot to compete with the Four Clans&rsquo; younger generation. Even if you all are to proceed onward, you will likely not be able to obtain the spot. Instead of that, it would be better to safely stay here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Jiang Furong, Bai Yunxiao and the others.<br>&ldquo;Actually, we also know that there is simply no chance for any of us to obtain the spot. However, it remains that this is a distinguished assembly. We originally just wanted to experience it. However, never did we expect that there would be people who would set out against us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After experiencing the Firerain Hall and the Jadewater Temple&rsquo;s ambush, we already do not plan to continue onward,&rdquo; Bai Yunxiao said with a bitter smile.<br>&ldquo;I will also not be continuing,&rdquo; Jiang Furong said, &ldquo;However, since we&rsquo;ve come, it will be unsuitable for us to forfeit. Thus, we will stay here and wait until the competition is over before going out.&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, Jiang Furong was a very thoughtful person. While her words seemed to not mean anything, and she seemed to just be going along with what Chu Feng had suggested, she was actually staying to watch Bai Yunxiao and the others in order to prevent them from reporting Chu Feng.<br>Suddenly, Jiang Furong said, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Junior brother Chu Feng, there is a piece of information that might be useful to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Countless experts are gathered in this assembly. The disciples of the Nine Powers all know very well that it was very unlikely for them to obtain victory. Furthermore, even if any of them become the victor, their fate would only be being trampled by the Four Clans&rsquo; younger generation. Thus, for many of them, they have only come here for the sake of coming. Like us, they merely wanted to experience this assembly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it is a different story for the World Spiritist Alliance. The World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Assembly Master is one of the Holy Land of Martialism&rsquo;s Ten Immortals. He possesses a personal disciple by the name of Mu Juechen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This Mu Juechen is someone who has never shown himself before. However, as the personal disciple of the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Assembly Master, his strength is definitely not weak.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This time around, when the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Assembly Master received the invitation to come here, he did not bring a single disciple from the World Spiritist Alliance. The only person he brought with him was his personal disciple, Mu Juechen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Likely, his objective is very clear-cut. He is planning to have Mu Juechen obtain the number one spot in this competition, and then compete against the Four Imperial Clans&rsquo; younger generation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, if you are to encounter someone by the name of Mu Juechen, you must be careful, and not underestimate him,&rdquo; Jiang Furong said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for your warning senior sister Jiang,&rdquo; After hearing what Jiang Furong said, Chu Feng nodded. However, he sighed in his heart, &ldquo;Seems like I will not be able to meet up with Lil Mei and the others. What a pity.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had thought that if the disciples from all the Nine Powers would be present, Su Mei would definitely be here too. Originally, he had been looking forward to seeing Su Mei again.<br>However, it turned out that Su Mei and the others simply had not come. All of them had been replaced by some guy named Mu Juechen.<br>Logically, Chu Feng was also a nominal disciple of the World Spiritist Alliance. Thus, he could be said to be a fellow disciple of that Mu Juechen, and thus should not view Mu Juechen as an enemy.<br>However, this time around, there was only a single spot. Thus, Chu Feng was determined to win. As such, regardless of what that Mu Juechen&rsquo;s origin might be, he would not be lenient.<br>Upon thinking about how that Mu Juechen had painstakingly trained for so long, yet would be defeated right after coming out in public, Chu Feng began to feel pity for him.<br>However, there was no other way about it. This was the world of martial cultivators. This was reality. One could not blame others for not having sufficient strength.<br>As for why Chu Feng was confident that he would be able to defeat Mu Juechen, it was because Chu Feng possessed the qualifications to act this confidently. He possessed the cultivation of a rank three Half Martial Emperor, and a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. On top of that, he possessed<br>Lightning<br>Armor and<br>Lightning<br>Wings, which could increase his cultivation by two levels.<br>With his overall strength, not to mention a Mu Juechen, even if that Weaponry Refinement Immortal&rsquo;s outstanding disciple Baili Xinghe or that Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Ximen Feixue were to fight against him, Chu Feng would not fear them.<br>The current Chu Feng was most definitely worthy of the title of the strongest member of the younger generation in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>&ldquo;In that case, senior brothers and sisters, I shall take my leave,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his hand, then left.<br>&ldquo;Junior brother Chu Feng,&rdquo; However, right at this moment, Bai Yunxiao suddenly spoke.<br>Chu Feng turned around and asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though I do not know what your purpose on this journey is, I still hope for you to be safe. After all, you are the Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s pride, our pride.&rdquo;<br>When Bai Yunxiao said those words, his emotions were rather complicated, and he was slightly hesitant.<br>He found it a bit embarrassing to say those words, because he felt that he was not qualified to say them. However, he still had to say them, for that was what he was truly feeling in his heart.<br>They were no fools. For Chu Feng to appear in this place when he was wanted by the Nangong Imperial Clan, and for him to want to become the victor of this competition, it was obvious that he wanted to obtain the spot to compete with the people from the Four Clans&rsquo; younger generation. Chu Feng&hellip; was planning to do something extremely shocking. He was planning to provoke the Four Imperial Clans.<br>Chu Feng was planning to, before all these people, publicly provoke the Four Great Imperial Clans.<br>They naturally know how dangerous and difficult something like that was.<br>Had it been before, they would have been eager for Chu Feng to die. In fact, when Chu Feng had been expelled by the Cyanwood Mountain, and when they heard the news of Chu Feng&rsquo;s death, they had all rejoiced.<br>However, after what happened today, an enormous change had happened to their hearts and minds. They suddenly felt that Chu Feng was a real fellow disciple, that what they had done before was merely the conduct of lowly, vile individuals.<br>They regretted what they did before, and no longer wished to continue being enemies with Chu Feng. Naturally, they would also not wish for something to happen to Chu Feng.<br>The reason for that was because, at this moment, they had realized that not only was Chu Feng a fellow disciple who would stand up for them, he might even become a hero who would stand up for the Cyanwood Mountain.<br>None of them wanted mishaps to happen to Chu Feng. They wished for Chu Feng to be able to grow without predicaments and continue to stand up for them.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I got this,&rdquo; Chu Feng held his thumb up while smiling. Then his body shifted, and he rapidly went deeper into this vast cave.<br>After Chu Feng left, Bai Yunxiao and the others began to gaze in the direction that Chu Feng had left in. It was as if they were unwilling to move their gazes away.<br>It was only after a long while that Bai Yunxiao sat cross-legged on the ground and said to Jiang Furong, &ldquo;Jiang Furong, there&rsquo;s no need for you to watch us. Junior brother Chu Feng saved us. If we are to repay kindness with hatred, we would be unqualified to be considered humans.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior sister Jiang, please rest assured, we are also people with consciences. Not only did junior brother Chu Feng disregard former hatreds and not do anything to us, he instead helped us. We will definitely repay him for the great grace he has shown us,&rdquo; Tao Xiangyu said. After she finished saying those words, she also sat down cross-legged on the ground, closed her eyes and began to train.<br>Afterward, Zhao Jingang, Qi Yanyu and the others also declared their positions and stated that they would not continue to view Chu Feng as an enemy in the future.<br>Seeing Bai Yunxiao and the others acting like this, Jiang Furong&rsquo;s heart was moved. She truly never expected that Chu Feng saving them would cause such an enormous change to Bai Yunxiao and the others.<br>However, even with this being the case, Jiang Furong still did not answer them. She would naturally not admit that she was staying in order to watch over them. Instead, she merely smiled, then also sat down in a cross-legged position.<br>The Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s disciples did not proceed further into the cave. Instead, they all sat down in cross-legged positions in the middle of the cave. Within the environment of the cave, they became a fixture that caused people confusion when they walked past them.<br></p></div>
