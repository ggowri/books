        <div> - The True Immortal&rsquo;s Anger<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Golden Crane True Immortal, do you not care about this matter?&rdquo; Chu Feng raised his head toward the sky and asked loudly.<br>&ldquo;Humph, you&rsquo;ve decided to ask for the Golden Crane True Immortal&rsquo;s assistance just because you can&rsquo;t win against us? Seems like you only possess that bit of ability too,&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng actually complained to the Golden Crane True Immortal, the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; expression changed.<br>They were not worried that Chu Feng would be able to break through their spirit formation, because they felt that it would be impossible for Chu Feng to break through their spirit formation.<br>However, they were still afraid of interference from the Golden Crane True Immortal. After all, when Chu Feng was beating down on their eldest brother, they had already, to a greater or lesser degree, realized that the Golden Crane True Immortal was secretly supporting Chu Feng.<br>Else, Chu Feng should have long since been teleported to the comprehensive formation; how else could he have been allowed to continue to beat up their big brother for so long? How could he only be teleported out after their big brother was beaten unconscious? It was clearly unreasonable.<br>Thus, they were afraid, afraid that the Golden Crane True Immortal would continue to pamper Chu Feng.<br>After all, the Golden Crane True Immortal&rsquo;s fame was widespread throughout the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. He was an extraordinary character. If the Golden Crane True Immortal were to truly discriminate in favor of Chu Feng, there would be nothing that they could do.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s question hung in the air for a very long time. Yet, there was no response from the Golden Crane True Immortal.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. Chu Feng, oh Chu Feng, it would seem that Lord True Immortal is not willing to bother with you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since Lord True Immortal is not bothering with this, it means that we have not violated the rules. Chu Feng, you can just continue to watch as the three of us become Immortal-cloak World Spiritists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the Golden Crane True Immortal did not respond after so long, the three brothers in the comprehensive formation, as well as their eldest brother outside, were unable to keep themselves from laughing at Chu Feng.<br>They were ridiculing him. Their laughter was filled with unconcealed ridicule toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It seems that the Golden Crane True Immortal really does not care about this. In that case, I am at ease,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;At ease?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the expressions of the crowd all changed. They revealed puzzled gazes.<br>The expressions of the three brothers in the comprehensive formation also changed. They were confused by what Chu Feng meant.<br>&ldquo;This means that I can give you all a taste of your own medicine,&rdquo; Chu Feng continued.<br>&ldquo;Haha, so you are actually one who will not shed a tear until you see your coffin. Very well, go ahead and give it a try. We shall see how you are to break through our spirit formation,&rdquo; The three brothers finally realized what Chu Feng meant. Thus, they mocked him.<br>&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; Once Chu Feng said those words, his hands began to change rapidly.<br>Surging spirit power began to rush out from his body to continuously bombard the spirit formation set up by the three brothers.<br>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do. Although Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation is amazing, those three brothers&rsquo; spirit formation is not affected in the slightest,&rdquo; Seeing that scene, many people present started to worry for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It is not that those three brothers&rsquo; spirit formation is amazing. Rather, they should have used treasures to increase the strength of their spirit formation. Else, how could those three possibly be able to contain little friend Chu Feng with their own strength?&rdquo; Daoist Three Swords said.<br>Suddenly, someone shouted, &ldquo;No, their formation is not unaffected! It seems that their spirit formation will not be able to continue to resist Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks!&rdquo;<br>At that time, the crowd realized that Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks were growing more and more ferocious. The spirit formation the three brothers had set up was starting to distort. It was as if their spirit formation would collapse at any moment.<br>However, the joy of the crowd lasted but a split second.<br>They soon discovered that the spirit formation was like rubber. Although the spirit formation was distorting and extending outward nonstop, it didn't seem like that spirit formation would be broken through.<br>&ldquo;That spirit formation is too strange. If this is to continue, it will be very hard for Chu Feng to break through it.&rdquo;<br>The crowd all started to worry for Chu Feng. After all, through the things that had happened earlier, they all discovered that Chu Feng&rsquo;s character greatly surpassed that of the Four World Spiritist Emperors. They were truly worried for Chu Feng because they all hoped that he would win.<br>However, Chu Feng was now sealed within that formation, and simply unable to comprehend the Immortal-level spirit power.<br>On the other hand, the surging Immortal-level spirit power was pounding onto the three brothers nonstop.<br>No matter how they looked at it, the current situation seemed very unfavorable for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless. Chu Feng, I might as well tell you this. Unless you possess Immortal-level spirit power, regardless of how powerful your spirit formation might be, you will not be able to break through our spirit formation,&rdquo; The second eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors proudly declared.<br>&ldquo;Oh, now that you mentioned it, you&rsquo;ve reminded me,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, while continuing with his current spirit formation, he began to set up another spirit formation.<br>Soon, another spirit formation was completed. That spirit formation fused together with his previous spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the Dragon Mark Immortal-level spirit power in the comprehensive formation seemed to have received an order, and started to pound against the spirit formation the three brothers had sealed Chu Feng with.<br>As Immortal-level spirit power was extremely powerful, it managed to shatter, destroy and completely engulf the spirit formation the three brothers had set up in merely a short moment.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Chu Feng is actually controlling that Immortal-level spirit power,&rdquo; Seeing this scene, the crowd were all shocked.<br>After all, the Immortal-level spirit power would not help Chu Feng for no reason. It was most definitely Chu Feng&rsquo;s doing to make the Immortal-level spirit power help him.<br>Merely, the crowd could not understand what sort of method Chu Feng had used to control the Immortal-level spirit power.<br>Could it be that it was simply not Chu Feng who controlled the Immortal-level spirit power, but instead the Golden Crane True Immortal who had helped him from the shadows?<br>&ldquo;No, this is impossible! You are but a mere Royal-cloak World Spiritist! How could you control Immortal-level spirit power?!&rdquo; When even the others were feeling disbelief, the Four World Spiritist Emperors naturally felt even greater disbelief.<br>Suddenly, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors turned to the sky and shouted, &ldquo;Lord True Immortal, although I do not know what sort of relationship you have with that Chu Feng, you shouldn&rsquo;t be helping him like this, no?! Do you really think this is fair?!&rdquo;<br>Even though he was unable to enter the comprehensive formation, he could not watch as his three brothers suffered.<br>As he believed that it was most definitely the Golden Crane True Immortal who had helped Chu Feng, he actually started to publicly question him.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after his words left his mouth, a muffled explosion sounded from his body. He who had completely cured the injuries inflicted upon him by Chu Feng was instantly mutilated. Powerless, he fell to the ground.<br>He began to vomit mouthfuls of blood nonstop.<br>Seeing this scene, the complexions of the crowd present all turned pale. They did not even dare to utter a single word.<br>They were all able to tell that it was the Golden Crane True Immortal who had done that. The questioning from the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors must&rsquo;ve angered the Golden Crane True Immortal, causing him to inflict a lesson upon him.<br>&ldquo;Your skills being inferior is your own fault. Do not use this Immortal as an excuse for your own failure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will consider this a first offense, and not bicker with you. However, if anyone dares say that this Immortal is helping someone again, do not blame me for not giving you the opportunity to live.&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, after that attack, the Golden Crane True Immortal&rsquo;s voice exploded from the sky like ten thousand thunders.<br>When that voice sounded, not only did the sky and the earth violently tremble, the crowd&rsquo;s hearts were also trembling.<br>Everyone could feel the Golden Crane True Immortal&rsquo;s anger. This Lord True Immortal&rsquo;s anger was truly capable of toppling the mountains and overturning the seas, splitting heaven and earth. They felt as if the end of the world had arrived.<br>Although his attack had seriously injured the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors, everyone knew that he had acted leniently.<br>If he hadn&rsquo;t, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors would definitely have been killed without a corpse remaining.<br>After all, the Golden Crane True Immortal possessed the ability to kill him instantly. Furthermore, he did not have to worry about killing him either.<br>Regardless of how powerful the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother might be, she would still be no match for the Golden Crane True Immortal.<br><br></p></div>
