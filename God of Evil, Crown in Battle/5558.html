        <h1>Chapter 5558: Indeed a Talent</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; Chief Elder 777asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, why do you say that?&rdquo; </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> asked out of curiosity.</span><br><span>Chief Elder 333 proceeded to inform them that the person behind the huge enhancement of the formation armor was a formation entity named 521.</span><br><span>Upon learning about what had happened, Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> eyes shone in contemplation, whereas the female chief elder flew into a tantrum.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What does the primal elder mean by this? Is he discriminating against us? How can Jie Tian snatch away our </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s</span><span> engineer just like that? Is he looking down on our </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> because she isn&rsquo;t a world spiritist? Why did he even get our </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> to enter the Star Memorial Domain then? He should have just let Jie Tian do everything by himself!&rdquo; she spoke so loudly that even those standing a distance away clearly heard her words.</span><br><span>The crowd was taken aback. It was blasphemy to insult the primal elder in the Star Sea Realm! However, the female chief elder was simply too angry.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do. I&rsquo;ll take 521 back,&rdquo; the female chief elder exclaimed.</span><br><span>Chief Elder 333 panicked. He quickly grabbed her arm and said, &ldquo;Let it go.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;How can I let it go? You don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s happening now!&rdquo; the female chief elder exclaimed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Chief Elder 333 suddenly realized that there might be another reason the female chief elder was so agitated.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk in there,&rdquo; the female chief elder said before entering the room with </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>.</span><br><span>Chief Elder 333 quickly followed them before locking off the room. The female chief elder proceeded to explain what they had encountered in the Star Memorial Domain this time around.</span><br><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> and Jie Tian had managed to venture into the depths of the Star Memorial Domain, where they stumbled upon an old palace. They suspected that this palace contained the true secret of the Immemorial Star Sea, just that their formation armor didn&rsquo;t have enough spirit power to fuel their entry, so they had to return for the time being to make adjustments.</span><br><span>Without a doubt, the two of them would be charging for the palace the next time they entered the Star Memorial Domain. The chances were likely that there were fortuitous encounters there. It went without saying that the one with the stronger formation armor would have an advantage in claiming the fortuitous encounter.</span><br><span>The female chief elder had been together with </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> for some time now, and she was fond of the latter. Thus, she hoped that </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> could get the most out of the exploration. This was why she felt so indignant about the primal elder&rsquo;s bias, especially at a crucial time like this.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The primal elder has already made his decision; you won&rsquo;t be able to change anything even if you throw a tantrum. However, you need not worry. I don&rsquo;t think Lord </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> will be in a disadvantageous position for the exploration. 521 left me with something right before he left,&rdquo; Chief Elder 333 said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He left you with something?&rdquo; the female chief elder asked.</span><br><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> also looked over with curious eyes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the formation armor?&rdquo; Chief Elder 333 asked.</span><br><span>The female chief elder quickly took out the formation armor. There were no visible defects in it, but the spirit power contained in it had become extremely weak. It needed to be serviced again before it could be used.</span><br><span>Chief Elder 333 inserted Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation into the formation armor before saying, &ldquo;Lord </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>, please infuse your bloodline power into the formation to activate it.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> replied with a nod before channeling her bloodline power into the formation.</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation immediately whirred into action. A blinding light burst out and enveloped the formation armor. The formation armor began to reshape itself. From its previous hulking height of over a hundred meters tall, it contracted till it was the size of </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s</span><span> body.</span><br><span>The formation armor didn&rsquo;t look as domineering as before, but it did feel much more graceful. This was a better fit for </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s</span><span> disposition. However, this didn&rsquo;t mean that the formation armor had become weaker; on the contrary, it had become much stronger.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He&hellip; understands me.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> touched the scales on the formation armor with eyes filled with disbelief. This formation armor didn&rsquo;t just look pretty&mdash;it perfectly fitted her sense of aesthetics. She was fond of it from the bottom of her heart.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Amazing! He perfectly fused the formation armor together with our </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s</span><span> bloodline </span><span>power. When did such a talent appear in our Star Sea Realm?&rdquo; The female chief elder was filled with compliments.</span><br><span>Even Chief Elder 333 was startled as well. He hadn&rsquo;t thought that the formation armor could be improved to such an extent. Had he not seen the transformation, he would have thought that it was a brand-new formation armor!</span><br><span>On top of that, the transformation charged the formation armor to the brim with spirit power so that it didn&rsquo;t have to be serviced anymore.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I have to meet 521 later on and relay my gratitude to him,&rdquo; </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> said in excitement.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That can be done,&rdquo; Chief Elder 333 said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;However, I don&rsquo;t want anyone else to know about the changes in my formation armor for the time being,&rdquo; </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> added.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; Chief Elder 333 replied with a nod.</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng arrived at Jie Tian&rsquo;s residence.</span><br><span>Jie Tian first sent the emaciated elder away before bringing Chu Feng to a formation. He turned to Chu Feng and ordered, &ldquo;Step into the formation.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng could sense the danger lurking inside the formation right away, so he asked, &ldquo;Why should I step in there?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hm. You are different from the rest.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Tian was surprised to see Chu Feng disobeying his order, but a vicious glint flashed across his eyes the next moment. He released a surge of spirit power to envelop Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Jie Tian was an Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist!</span><br><span>&ldquo;This fellow!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng realized that Jie Tian was indeed a prodigy.</span><br><span>Most Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists wielded power comparable to rank seven Half-God level cultivators, but Jie Tian&rsquo;s fighting prowess had reached the level of a rank eight Half-God level cultivator.</span><br><span>He had a heaven-defying battle power of one cultivation rank in terms of spirit power!</span><br><span>Chu Feng, in his current state, wasn&rsquo;t a match for Jie Tian at all.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a smart man. A perilous threat is indeed awaiting you inside the formation, but there is a chance you might survive if you are sufficiently competent as a world spiritist. You may choose not to enter as well, but I&rsquo;ll personally kill you right away,&rdquo; Jie Tian said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It looks like the rumors are true. You don&rsquo;t see us as living beings at all,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;</span><span>You&rsquo;re</span><span> mere formation entities. What lives do you have to speak of? Regardless, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to me whether you are living beings or not,&rdquo; Jie Tian said as his killing intent intensified.</span><br><span>Knowing that he had no choice, Chu Feng stepped into the formation and immediately felt the formation&rsquo;s murderous intent. Without any hesitation, he channeled his spirit power to construct a formation.</span><br><span>There was only one way for him to survive, and that was to breach the formation.</span><br><span>Most people would have died as soon as they stepped into the formation, but Chu Feng was no ordinary person. He had examined the formation beforehand and thought of a countermeasure. Even so, it took him six hours to decipher the formation.</span><br><span>He was utterly exhausted by the time he deciphered the formation. He lay on the floor, taking huge gasps of air.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Not bad. It looks like I finally found a useful one. Here, eat this,&rdquo; Jie Tian said as he offered Chu Feng a pill.</span><br><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart clenched upon seeing the pill. It was a poison pill.</span><br></p></div>
