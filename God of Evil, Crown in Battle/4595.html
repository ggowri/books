        <div>: Obtaining a Slot?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Through listening to Song Yun&rsquo;s explanations, Chu Feng managed to obtain a better idea of the situation over at the Asura Graveyard.<br>The realm that the Asura Graveyard was located in was known as the Graveyard Realm. While the Graveyard Realm contained a widely feared forbidden ground, it did have a master&mdash;the Wretched Black Demon.<br>The Wretched Black Demon was a highly-skilled world spiritist, but that didn&rsquo;t mean that one could underestimate his martial cultivation. In the entire Nine Souls Galaxy, there was hardly anyone who would dare to make an enemy out of him.<br>In fact, it was rumored that even the Nine Souls Sacred Clan would have to spare him some face.<br>The Graveyard Realm was an open realm, where people were free to enter and leave. However, there were many lands that were considered as the Wretched Black Demon&rsquo;s private territory, and outsiders were forbidden from entering these areas.<br>Of the lands under the Wretched Black Demon&rsquo;s jurisdiction, there was one that was known as the Incubation Forest. The Divine Rejuvenation Pearl that Song Yun needed for her illness was located in no other than the Incubation Forest.<br>The Incubation Forest was usually protected by a barrier, which would alert the Wretched Black Demon right away if any intruders dared to come close. Due to that, Song Yun had never been able to enter the area to obtain the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl.<br>However, a window of opportunity had just opened up recently.<br>It all started with the Wretched Black Demon&rsquo;s granddaughter. Despite the Wretched Black Demon&rsquo;s notorious reputation, it was rumored that her granddaughter was a woman who boasted a beauty on par with the goddesses.<br>As it turned out, the Wretched Black Demon was as fond of world spiritist techniques as he was skilled in them. He believed that his grandson-in-law should be a skilled world spiritist too, so he decided to hold a matchmaking convention for his granddaughter in the Graveyard Realm.<br>The winner of the matchmaking convention would be granted the right to marry the Wretched Black Demon&rsquo;s granddaughter.<br>For this matchmaking convention, the Wretched Black Demon invited all of the reputable young world spiritists throughout the Nine Souls Galaxy. World spiritists who hadn&rsquo;t received an invitation were allowed to join too, but they had to clear a selection round in order to officially join the race.<br>And the selection round was going to be held in no other than the Incubation Forest.<br>It was due to this that Song Yun needed Chu Feng&rsquo;s help. Due to the restrictions cast on the Incubation Forest, she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use martial power in there, which meant that she had to rely solely on her spirit power.<br>And Song Yun&rsquo;s spirit power was clearly no match for those talented world spiritist. However, if she could engage Chu Feng&rsquo;s help, she would be much more confident of achieving success.<br>&hellip;<br>Soon, Chu Feng and Song Yun managed to enter the Graveyard Realm without too much trouble along the way.<br>Despite its ominous name, the Graveyard Realm was actually not much different from the other realms. It had tall mountains and gushing rivers; there was nothing that really set it apart from other realms at first glance.<br>On their way to the Incubation Forest, aside from the beautiful scenery, they had also passed by several hundred abysses. This was probably the biggest distinguishing trait between the Graveyard Realm and the other realms.<br>Even if the other realms did have such abysses, they wouldn&rsquo;t be clustered together like the Graveyard Realm.<br>Just as they were approaching the Incubation Forest, Chu Feng suddenly halted his footsteps and turned his sights southwest. His gaze fell upon an abyss that was located in the distance.<br>This abyss had a diameter of around ten thousand meters wide, and its perimeter was surrounded by wild grass. Just like the other abysses they had encountered, it was so deep that they couldn&rsquo;t see the bottom of it.<br>Along the way, the two of them had passed by at least dozens of abysses that were even more spectacular than this, but for some reason, this particular abyss caught Chu Feng&rsquo;s attention.<br>From the moment his eyes fell upon it, he instinctively knew that this was the renowned Asura Graveyard.<br>&ldquo;Is that the Asura Graveyard?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had his guesses, but he still turned to seek verification from Song Yun.<br>&ldquo;Asura Graveyard? I don&rsquo;t think so though&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Song Yun shook her head in response. It was also her first time here, so she wasn&rsquo;t too certain about it. However, in her view, given the notorious reputation of the Asura Graveyard, it should have been filled with all sorts of horrors around, but the abyss that Chu Feng just pointed out looked perfectly ordinary.<br>Nevertheless, she still took out her map to verify. And when she finally made a comparison, her eyes immediately widened in astonishment.<br>&ldquo;My dear big brother Chu Feng, how are you so incredible? How did you know that that is the Asura Graveyard?&rdquo; Song Yun remarked in shock.<br>The abyss which Chu Feng had just pointed out was indeed the renowned Asura Graveyard!<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just an instinct. Wait here for a moment. I would like to head a bit nearer to take a look,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Are you out of your mind? Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that the Asura Evil Spirits have the ability to beguile one&rsquo;s heart? They&rsquo;ll control you if you get too close!&rdquo; Song Yun exclaimed in horror.<br>However, Chu Feng simply responded with a calm smile as he tried to calm Song Yun down.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured. I know what I&rsquo;m doing. I won&rsquo;t get too close.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, he began making his way toward the Asura Graveyard.<br>Shoosh!<br>However, before Chu Feng could even get a close, a silhouette suddenly swooped down and blocked Chu Feng&rsquo;s path.<br>It was a white-haired old man dressed in the robes of a world spiritist.<br>&ldquo;Name yourself, intruder! Why are you approaching the Asura Graveyard?&rdquo;<br>The old man eyed Chu Feng sharply. It looked almost as if he would kill Chu Feng right away if there was anything wrong with what he said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I have come here to participate in the matchmaking convention. It just so happens that I&rsquo;ve long heard of the Asura Graveyard, so I wanted to take a look from a closer distance,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist and replied.<br>This old man was able to appear silently before Chu Feng without alerting him, which meant that he was definitely much stronger than Chu Feng. On top of that, the fact that the old man stopped him from approaching the Asura Graveyard likely meant that he was an underling of the Wretched Black Demon. It was best for Chu Feng to treat such an individual with respect.<br>&ldquo;Take a look from a closer distance? If you have heard of the Asura Graveyard, shouldn&rsquo;t you be aware of the dangers it poses? Hurry up and leave this area. Stay as far away from here as possible.<br>&ldquo;If you are intending to participate in the matchmaking convention, you may register at the Cloudmist Forest. If you prove yourself qualified, I wish you all the best. Otherwise, you should leave this place as quickly as possible.<br>&ldquo;The Graveyard Realm is not a place where you can frolic around.&rdquo;<br>The old man waved his hand before turning around to leave.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I have contracted a world spirit from the Asura Spirit World, so I have special feelings for Asura World Spirits. I know that the Asura Graveyard is a dangerous place, but I would just like to observe it from a little closer up. I promise that I won&rsquo;t go too far,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? You&rsquo;re a world spiritist?&rdquo;<br>Surprisingly, the old man&rsquo;s attitude toward Chu Feng alleviated a little. He was no longer as forceful as he was before.<br>&ldquo;But even if I allow you to pass, you won&rsquo;t be able to get close. There&rsquo;s a barrier right ahead. Unless Lord Black Demon opens it, otherwise no one will be able to pass the barrier.<br>&ldquo;However, if you&rsquo;re really interested in the Asura Graveyard, I suggest you head to the Cloudmist Forest and win a slot for yourself in the matchmaking convention.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the old man&rsquo;s figure flickered from vanishing into thin air.<br>&ldquo;Win a slot in the matchmaking convention? What does that mean? Will I be allowed to enter the Asura Graveyard as long as I get a slot?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound too probable. The Asura Graveyard is such a dangerous location, so who would dare to enter it?&rdquo;<br>Song Yun walked up to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side and said. Even though she was a distance away, she still managed to hear the conversation between Chu Feng and the old man loud and clear.<br></p></div>
