        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Response<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Outside the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s main city, Chu Feng, Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren were still being stopped by the people from the Military Hall.<br>However, the people gathered there were no longer limited to only Chu Feng, Chu Xingde, Chu Xingren and the people of the Military Hall.<br>News of his arrival spread very quickly. The news of Chu Feng&rsquo;s return to the Chu Heavenly Clan and then being stopped by people from the Military Hall outside the main city was currently spreading.<br>At that moment, there were many people currently gathering in the area. Furthermore, over ten thousand people were already gathered behind the people from the Military Hall. Their number was still increasing.<br>There were even many familiar faces among them.<br>For example, Chu Lingxi, Chu Ruoshi, Chu Huanyu and Chu Xianshuo were all present.<br>There was another person present among the crowd that knew of Chu Feng, while Chu Feng did not know of him.<br>He was also a member of the younger generation. His name was Chu Huai.<br>Chu Huai and Chu Yue were subordinates of Chu Bore in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. They were in charge of monitoring the situation in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>After returning to the Chu Heavenly Clan, Chu Huai had been staying in the clan and training the entire time. However, he was very concerned about this news of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve actually really become a rank five True Immortal now,&rdquo; Chu Huai was secretly examining Chu Feng. After he felt Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura, he gasped with endless admiration.<br>When he had first encountered Chu Feng in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, he was already a rank four True Immortal. At that time, Chu Feng was still a mere Martial Ancestor.<br>However, Chu Feng was already a rank five True Immortal. Yet he&hellip; was still only a rank four True Immortal.<br>Back then, he was an existence akin to a god overlooking all the beings in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>However, at present, even though he was standing in the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory, he felt as if he were looking up at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Geniuses are truly the most unreasonable beings in the world of martial cultivation,&rdquo; After gasping in admiration, Chu Huai revealed a smile on his face.<br>He felt happiness for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Genius? That Chu Feng is nothing but exiled trash,&rdquo; Chu Huai&rsquo;s lightly spoken words of admiration were heard by a fellow clansman beside him. That clansman immediately started sneering at him.<br>That person was one of Chu Huanyu&rsquo;s footmen that was present outside the Ghost Sect Hall that day.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, he&rsquo;s nothing more than exiled trash. Did he really think he would be able to return to the clan just because Chu Xuanzhengfa was shielding him? He is truly delusional.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Look at him, he&rsquo;s stunned now, no? He&rsquo;s actually blocked outside the main city. Serves him right!&rdquo;<br>Following that person, more Chu Heavenly Clansmen started to mock Chu Feng. They were mocking him very loudly. They were not doing this because they wanted Chu Feng to hear their mockery of him. Instead, they were doing this because they wanted Chu Huanyu to hear their mockery of Chu Feng. After all, they were all saying such things to flatter Chu Huanyu.<br>That said, while they were only mocking Chu Feng to flatter Chu Huanyu, there were indeed many people inside the Chu Heavenly Clan that weren&rsquo;t fond of Chu Feng, many people that did not wish for his return to the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Thus, at that moment, more and more people started to insult Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a furious shout sounded from the direction of the main city.<br>When that furious shout was heard, the crowd immediately closed their mouths. The reason for that was because that furious shout came from Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa was flying over with an army of people from the Law Enforcement Hall.<br>The people that saw them immediately moved aside. They were truly imposing.<br>In the end, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the Law Enforcement Hall army arrived behind the group of people from the Military Hall.<br>&ldquo;Move aside,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said to the Military Hall&rsquo;s Chu Moqiong. His tone was very cold. He simply did not put that Chu Moqiong in his eyes at all.<br>&ldquo;Lord Zhengfa, it is not that I do not wish to comply with your command, but&hellip;&rdquo; As Chu Moqiong spoke, he raised the Supreme Elder&rsquo;s title plate. He was planning to use that title plate to suppress Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>However, who would&rsquo;ve expected for Chu Xuanzhengfa to not even bother to take a glance at that title plate. He merely said coldly, &ldquo;Scram.&rdquo;<br>He said that word very loudly. Practically everyone present heard it.<br>At that moment, Chu Moqiong&rsquo;s expression turned extremely ugly. He was even clenching his fists tightly. If one were standing close to him, one would be able to hear the creaking sound of his fists.<br>From this, one could imagine how furious Chu Moqiong was.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? You want to fight?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t dare, this lowly one wouldn&rsquo;t dare,&rdquo; Right after Chu Xuanzhengfa spoke, Chu Moqiong hurriedly lowered his head and began to apologize.<br>He knew very well what sort of person Chu Xuanzhengfa was. Thus, he knew that no matter how displeased he felt, he could not go against him.<br>Thus, even though Chu Moqiong was holding a title plate from an Supreme Elder, he still had no choice but to lead his men from the Military Hall and move aside.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ve caused you grief. Unfortunately, there are rules in our clan,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said. His tone was extremely remorseful.<br>After all, it was him who had urged Chu Feng to return. However, such a thing happened right after Chu Feng returned. Because of this, he would naturally feel guilty.<br>That said, Chu Feng knew very well that everything Chu Xuanzhengfa did was for his sake. Thus, he did not blame Chu Xuanzhengfa in the slightest. On the contrary, Chu Feng also felt a great amount of guilt toward Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>&ldquo;Senior, if the Chu Heavenly Clan is unwilling to let me return, then let&rsquo;s forget about it. I, Chu Feng&hellip; do not necessarily have to return to the Chu Heavenly Clan. I would instead be more free should I not be part of the Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what the hell are you saying?! Are you still looking down on our Chu Heavenly Clan?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What audacity! Someone like you should forever remain exiled!&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, he immediately raised resentment from the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s crowd.<br>At that moment, voices lashing out at Chu Feng came like a torrential rain.<br>&ldquo;All of you, shut up! Since when are you all qualified to speak when our Law Enforcement Hall is handling things?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If anyone dares to utter another word, they shall be punished according to our clan&rsquo;s laws!&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa shouted angrily.<br>His furious shout caused space to tremble, and the hearts of many of the people present to tense up.<br>After all, Chu Xuanzhengfa was an Exalted-level expert. Although Chu Xuanzhengfa was most definitely not the only Exalted-level expert in the Chu Heavenly Clan, he was the only Exalted-level expert currently present.<br>Once Chu Xuanzhengfa said those words, all the people that were not fond of Chu Feng immediately shut their mouths.<br>They were able to tell that Chu Xuanzhengfa truly thought highly of Chu Feng, that he truly wanted to support Chu Feng.<br>&lsquo;Humph, no matter how highly you think of Chu Feng, it&rsquo;ll still be useless. You are but the Law Enforcement Hall&rsquo;s Vice Hall Master. The one that refuses to have Chu Feng return to our clan right now is our Supreme Elder. How exactly are you going to keep that Chu Feng here?&rsquo; Displeased, the crowd could only curse at Chu Xuanzhengfa in their hearts.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Lord Supreme Elder has said that you can return to our clan. However&hellip; you will have to undertake a test,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>&ldquo;What? Lord Supreme Elder actually allowed Chu Feng to return to our clan?!&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Xuanzhengfa said those words, he immediately caused the people who did not wish for Chu Feng to return to the Chu Heavenly Clan to feel their hearts tighten.<br>&ldquo;What sort of test?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You would have to climb the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>&ldquo;Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps, that test is too simple, no?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, those Chu Heavenly Clansmen were even more astonished. At the same time, they felt even more displeased.<br>The reason for that was because practically all of them were capable of ascending the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps. In fact, ascending the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps was a very simple task.<br>However, right at that moment, Chu Xuanzhengfa added, &ldquo;You must ascend to the eighth step in order to pass.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, those people who hoped for Chu Feng to return to the Chu Heavenly Clan were stunned.<br>Eighth step? This was simply too difficult. In the entire Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s history, only their Old Ancestor had managed to ascend to the eighth step.<br>While Chu Huai and the others were worried, Chu huanyu and the others were overjoyed.<br>&lsquo;Chu Feng, what are you going to do now?&rsquo; Chu Huanyu sneered in his heart.<br>However, at the moment when everyone felt that Chu Feng would be stumped, Chu Feng said expressionlessly, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd present all revealed an astonished expression. Even Chu Lingxi, the girl who had always remained unwavering, revealed an astonished expression in her beautiful eyes.<br>Chu Feng actually accepted it so easily. Did Chu Feng not know how difficult it was to ascend to the eighth step, or was he truly confident in being able to ascend to the eighth step?<br><br><br></p></div>
