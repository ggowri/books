        <div> - Emotional Quarrel<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Those things?!!!&rdquo;<br>Seeing such a thing, Grandmaster Liangqiu and Chu Xuanzhengfa were immediately stunned. At the same time, complicated emotions of astonishment and fear mixed together on their faces.<br>Even Gu Mingyuan had the same look on her face.<br>After all, those were over ten thousand Utmost Exalted-level existences.<br>As people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, they all knew what over ten thousand Utmost Exalted-level existences represented.<br>Most importantly, not only were the ten thousand plus Utmost Exalted-level existences all behind the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, but they were also half-kneeling in a manner akin to subordinates, where the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was their master.<br>Most importantly of all, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was holding a silver halberd.<br>The aura of that halberd filled heaven and earth and swept through everything. After the halberd appeared, everything in the world appeared very small and insignificant.<br>Even a martial cultivator as conceited as Gu Mingyuan felt completely suppressed.<br>It was as if a ruler had descended upon the world!!!<br>&ldquo;Ox-nose, could it be, you&rsquo;ve obtained the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd?&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu asked with a startled voice.<br>Even though he was unwilling to believe it, the truth was right before his eyes. Thus, he had no choice but to believe it.<br>Merely, he was very puzzled as to how the Ox-nosed Old Daoist could possibly obtain such a precious weapon.<br>&ldquo;Hehe. To be exact, it was obtained by that boy.&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist did not attempt to take credit for Chu Feng&rsquo;s achievement, and pointed to Chu Feng, who stood beside him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?!&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s answer astonished Grandmaster Liangqiu, Gu Mingyuan and Chu Xuanzhengfa even more.<br>Immediately, their eyes all turned to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Actually, I only helped slightly. It was mainly senior Daoist&rsquo;s contribution.&rdquo; Chu Feng said in a very modest manner.<br>Gu Mingyuan suddenly revealed a look of anger. She pointed at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and asked angrily, &ldquo;Ox-nosed Old Daoist, did you exploit Chu Feng?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Alas, what do you mean by that? How could I exploit him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I merely came into an agreement with him beforehand where the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd would belong to me should he successfully retrieve it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course&hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t have him exert himself for free. I will be presenting him with benefits too.&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;What sort of benefit could you possibly give him?!&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan asked angrily. She was very emotional and very furious. She was acting like the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had done something to take advantage of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior Daoist has agreed to help me fuse with my Divine Power,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, both Gu Mingyuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu revealed an identical expression.<br>It was an expression of feeling things turning very bad.<br>&ldquo;Ox-nosed Old Daoist, you dared to deceive Chu Feng?! I&rsquo;m going to kill you!&rdquo;<br>Not only did Gu Mingyuan become even more furious, but she had also released her own Utmost Exalted-level oppressive might. Judging from her appearance, she was planning to fight the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Rooooarrr~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>At practically the same time, the ten thousand plus Utmost Exalted-level guardian spirits all moved. They took on an offensive posture and surrounded Gu Mingyuan.<br>It seemed like the ten thousand plus Utmost Exalted-level guardian spirits would immediately unleash full-on attacks at her should she attempt anything.<br>&ldquo;Gu Mingyuan, I know that you&rsquo;re very arrogant, despotic and unreasonable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I currently hold the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd in my hand.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd is capable of controlling these guardian spirits. If you plan to fight me, you&rsquo;d best make careful considerations.&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said as he raised the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.<br>&ldquo;Humph, you think trash like these could stop me?&rdquo;<br>However, faced with over ten thousand Utmost Exalted-level guardian spirits, Gu Mingyuan showed no sign of fear.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I voluntarily agreed to cooperate with senior Daoist. He did not force me, and did not deceive me.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the situation was bad, Chu Feng hurriedly stood before Gu Mingyuan to stop her. He was afraid that they would really end up fighting.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, if this Ox-nosed Old Daoist is truly capable of granting you Divine Power, I will naturally have no complaints.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you don&rsquo;t understand him. This Ox-nosed Old Daoist is simply incapable of fusing Divine Power into anyone&rsquo;s body at all. No one could possibly be capable of that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This Ox-nosed bastard has deceived others using this sort of thing countless times.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is one thing for him to deceive others, yet he&rsquo;s actually deceiving you too. With this, how could I possibly tolerate him?&rdquo; said Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, what Gu Mingyuan said is correct.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, even Grandmaster Liangqiu spoke. Then, he looked to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. With anger, he said, &ldquo;Ox-nose, no matter what, you are young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s senior, how could you deceive him like this?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Deceive? This old man has never deceived anyone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, fusing with Divine Power is going against the rule of nature to begin with. It is extremely difficult to accomplish.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For those people to fail to accomplish it, it could only mean that they lacked aptitude. However, this old man has indeed helped someone fuse with Divine Power before.&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d succeeded. Very well, why don&rsquo;t you tell us who you helped with fuse Divine Power successfully?&rdquo; said Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;That person refused to let me say his name. Thus, I am unable to tell you who that person is.&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re unable to successfully fuse Divine Power with anyone, and are unable to provide a single case of success. Are you still refusing to admit that you&rsquo;re a scam?&rdquo; asked Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;I myself know my own skills best. Why would I bother to make you all understand what I&rsquo;m capable of?&rdquo;<br>Faced with Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s repeated questions, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist revealed a look of indifference. He seemed to be indicating that she could think of him however she wished.<br>&ldquo;You damned scam, you&rsquo;re looking for a beating!&rdquo;<br>Gu Mingyuan was so furious that her face had turned completely red. As she spoke, she prepared to attack the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, Senior Gu, I know that the two of you are thinking for my good.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I feel that senior Daoist will not deceive me. I believe him.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the situation was bad, Chu Feng spoke again.<br>Even if Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t believe anyone else, he wouldn&rsquo;t possibly refuse to believe his father.<br>Since it was his father who had mentioned to him that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was capable of fusing Divine Power into one&rsquo;s body, Chu Feng firmly believed that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was capable of such a feat.<br>Chu Feng even felt that the reason why others did not believe the Ox-nosed Old Daoist must be because they had some sort of misunderstanding about him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was so firm in believing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and not them, Gu Mingyuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu both felt very helpless and even slightly angry.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, since you&rsquo;re unwilling to listen, you can give it a try yourself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will supervise this old thing for you so that he will not attempt to run away.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Have him teach you how to fuse with Divine Power before my eyes.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once you discover that he has deceived you, tell me about it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, I will help you teach him a lesson.&rdquo;<br>Although she was angry, Gu Mingyuan did not give up on Chu Feng, and was still planning to stand up for him.<br>Seeing Gu Mingyuan like that, Chu Feng felt very moved.<br>Whether or not she believed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was her business.<br>However, Gu Mingyuan was making considerations for Chu Feng&rsquo;s good from the bottom of her heart.<br></p></div>
