        <div> - Stalemate<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Senior Zi, don&rsquo;t join in,&rdquo; Seeing Zi Xunyi&rsquo;s expression, Chu Feng sent a voice transmission to her, &ldquo;Senior Ying has yet to go all-out. Furthermore, I feel that with how confident the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster is, he most definitely possesses more hidden techniques.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If the two of them are to both unleash their full abilities, their strength will be completely above that of ordinary rank two True Immortals. If you are to be in the battle at that time, you will only become a burden for Senior Ying.&rdquo;<br>After hearing what Chu Feng said, Zi Xunyi, who was planning to join the battle, stopped thinking about joining the battle.<br>Although she did not know what sort of abilities the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster might still have, she knew very well that Ying Mingchao was a True Immortal that had managed to unlock the strength of his Divine Power.<br>This information had long been spread out by Grandmaster Prophet. It was something that everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm knew about.<br>It was precisely because Ying Mingchao was a rank two True Immortal and possessed Divine Power that people viewed him as the strongest expert in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>Likely, the reason why the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple&rsquo;s Abbot and the Immortal Sword School&rsquo;s Headmaster did not try to stop Ying Mingchao from attacking the Infant Soul Sect earlier was also because they were afraid of Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s actual strength.<br>However, precisely because the matter of Ying Mingchao having unlocked his Divine Power was known to everyone, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster must know about it too. As such, Zi Xunyi felt that what Chu Feng said was very reasonable.<br>Since he knew already that Ying Mingchao had unlocked his Divine Power and was not an ordinary rank two True Immortal, the confidence of the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster meant that&hellip; he must possess some sort of method to handle him.<br>Thinking about that, Zi Xunyi began to grip her Ancestral Armaments even more tightly. In fact, Chu Feng could even hear the creaking sounds emitted by the Zi Xunyi&rsquo;s hand bones.<br>&ldquo;Senior, we do not need to directly join the battle in order to help Senior Ying Mingchao,&rdquo; Chu Feng said via voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; Zi Xunyi asked. Her eyes started to shine with light.<br>&ldquo;Senior, since you have also obtained Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s inheritance before, do you know of this formation?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng informed Zi Xunyi of a spirit formation.<br>That spirit formation was something that Zi Xunyi did not know about. However, it remained that Zi Xunyi was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Thus, just from Chu Feng&rsquo;s descriptions of the spirit formation, she was able to make out of what it did.<br>After that, Chu Feng began to secretly set up the spirit formation together with Zi Xunyi. As for why they had to do it secretly, it was naturally because they did not want others to discover it.<br>After all, the allied army had already fallen apart. For their own self-interest, even the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple&rsquo;s Abbot and the Immortal Sword School&rsquo;s Headmaster had spoken out on behalf of the Infant Soul Sect.<br>If they were to discover that Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi were setting up a spirit formation beneficial to Ying Mingchao, who knew whether or not they would act to interfere.<br>Thus, Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi must set up that spirit formation secretly. Fortunately, the spirit formation techniques that Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi possessed were extremely powerful. Thus, even though it would be more difficult to quietly set up a spirit formation within their bodies, the two of them would only each have to set up half of the spirit formation should they jointly set it up. Thus, as long as they were given a sufficient amount of time, they would be able to finish setting up that spirit formation.<br>Although Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi were extremely worried by the stalemate between Ying Mingchao and the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster, those people whose eyes were blinded by greed, those people that wished to obtain martial comprehension from that Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s grand formation, were secretly delighted.<br>At the beginning when Ying Mingchao began to fight against the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster, they were all afraid, afraid that Ying Mingchao would be able to easily kill the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster. After all, Ying Mingchao was the publicly-accepted number one expert in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>However, judging from the situation now, the two of them were actually equally matched. Furthermore, the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple&rsquo;s Abbot and the Immortal Sword School&rsquo;s Headmaster were not planning to join the battle. Thus, the greedy crowd grew much more at ease.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, a beast-like roar suddenly sounded from Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s body.<br>At the moment when that roar was heard, the image of a ferocious beast appeared in the sky. Its aura was extremely domineering. It was as if it were planning to devour all living things. Seeing it, many people started to tremble with fear.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>At practically the same time, an explosion sounded from the battlefield between Ying Mingchao and the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster. The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was actually beaten back.<br>Not only that, but there was a bloody hole in the left side of his chest. The left side of his chest had been penetrated, and a visible bloodstain was present at the corner of his mouth.<br>Looking to Ying Mingchao, he currently looked completely different from before. His eyes had turned dark green. Even his teeth had become sharp like a beast&rsquo;s. A jade green aura was coiling around his body like green flames.<br>At this moment, Ying Mingchao was several times stronger than he was before.<br>&ldquo;Divine Power?&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, the crowd were all frightened. They had nearly forgotten that Ying Mingchao was not only a rank two True Immortal, but he was also an existence that had managed to unlock the power of his Divine power.<br>Most importantly, they had only heard rumors of it before. As such, they were skeptical. However, they were now witnessing it with their very own eyes. With this, how could they not start to panic?<br>After unleashing his Divine Power, how could the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster possibly contend against Ying Mingchao?<br>&ldquo;Divine Power. It would seem that the rumors are true, you have indeed managed to unlock your Divine Power.&rdquo;<br>Compared to others, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster merely smiled. Not only was he not panicking, but he even softly wiped away the bloodstain at the corner of his mouth. The wound on the left side of his chest also closed up.<br>At this moment when the crowd were confused as to why the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was still this calm, they were shocked to discover that&hellip; the eyes of the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster had turned pitch-black.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, a loud explosion sounded from the body of the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster. At the same time, dark black gaseous flames bubbled out of the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster like a volcanic eruption.<br>In an instant, the dark black gaseous flames covered the entire sky. At this moment, apart from the enormous ferocious beast emitted by Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s Divine Power, the rest of the sky was covered by those dark black gaseous flames.<br>Most importantly, the cries and wailings of infants could be heard from the dark black gaseous flames that covered the entire sky.<br>There were simply too many cries and wailings. They were simply too ear-piercing, simply too tragic.<br>The cries and wailings were simply over a thousand times more mournful than the cries and wailings emitted from the activation of the Infant Soul Grand Formation.<br>&ldquo;Forbidden Mysterious Technique?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, he&rsquo;s prepared.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was not surprised to see this scene. He had already anticipated that the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster possessed the ability to contend against Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s Divine Power.<br>Merely, Chu Feng did not expect it to be a Forbidden Mysterious Technique.<br>However, this Forbidden Mysterious Technique was clearly not an ordinary Forbidden Mysterious Technique. To be exact, this should be a Forbidden Demonic Technique.<br>The reason for that was because it could be determined merely by the mournful infant cries that the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster had used this demonic technique to refine countless infants.<br>He had used the lives of countless infants to obtain his powerful strength.<br>However, such a sinister demonic technique did not bring disdain from the crowd. Instead, many grew excited upon seeing it.<br>Those that were excited were naturally the selfish individuals that wanted to obtain the assistance of the Infant Soul Sect.<br>&ldquo;Despicable bastard, I will have you die!!!&rdquo;<br>After seeing the power of the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster, Ying Mingchao grew even more furious. With the unique imposing might of his Divine Power, Ying Mingchao rushed to attack the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster again.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&hellip;...<br>Green gaseous flames and dark black gaseous flames collided.<br>It was like a battle between light and darkness. However, this battle was once again in a stalemate.<br>The intensity of this battle had increased by several times. Now, even Zi Xunyi and the others were unable to withstand the energy ripples from this battle.<br>As such, the allied army had no choice but to move away from the battlefield. As for the people from the Infant Soul Sect, they moved even further away.<br>As for Chen Heavenly City that was in the center of the battlefield, it had long since been completely ruined by the energy ripples from the two fighters.<br>That vast city and those extravagant buildings were completely razed to the ground. It was a devastating scene.<br>The scope of the battle was growing larger and larger. The intensity of the battle also grew more and more world-shakingly powerful. Looking at it, everyone grew more and more afraid.<br>Once again, people began to worry about this life and death battle.<br><br></p></div>
