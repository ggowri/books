        <div> - Insurmountable<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Sure enough, he became stronger again.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the current Linghu Hongfei, even Queen Mother Fox Immortal outside the grand formation was unable to keep herself from letting out a gasp of admiration.<br>The last time she met Linghu Hongfei was three years ago. At that time, he was only a rank one Exalted. He could already show disdain for all of the younger generations of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Yet, at that moment, Linghu Hongfei had already become a rank two Exalted. His cultivation was already at a level that the others couldn&rsquo;t possibly reach.<br>Thus, even though that sword guardian beast possessed the strength of a rank one Exalted, it was still defeated from a single attack by Linghu Hongfei.<br>&ldquo;Having obtained two spirit formation swords, that Linghu Hongfei is now capable of opening that entrance gate,&rdquo; Liangqiu Chengfeng said.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, he wouldn't give up with just that. After all, the more spirit formation swords one gathers, the more power one will obtain after entering that place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What Linghu Hongfei wants to become is a Saint-cloak World Spiritist. He wouldn&rsquo;t give up so easily. He will continue until he has absolute certainty in making a breakthrough to become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist,&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun said.<br>&ldquo;If possible, I would rather he not seek instant benefits like that. Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s talent in terms of world spirit techniques is actually very strong too. It&rsquo;s merely that he has rarely revealed his world spirit techniques, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he continues to train his world spirit techniques by relying on his own capabilities and not external assistance, he might even be able to become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist in the future.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if he is to rely on external forces to forcibly become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he'll likely be stuck being an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist for the rest of his life,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu said.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, you must not attempt to dissuade him. After all, whether or not we&rsquo;ll succeed will depend on that brat&rsquo;s power. If he is to open that gate and not enter it, we will not be able to obtain the power either,&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun said.<br>&ldquo;Even if Grandmaster Liangqiu wishes to dissuade him, it will be useless. Linghu Hongfei simply doesn&rsquo;t care about his world spirit techniques at all. He is wholly infatuated with martial cultivation. As for becoming a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he merely wants to do it for the fame.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To him, gaining the title of the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist is much more important than becoming a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist in the future.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, he has been receiving external assistance his entire life. He has never relied on his own power to cultivate his world spirit techniques. As matters stand, even if he regrets it, it's already too late, as he has already burned his bridges,&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan said.<br>&ldquo;What Long Xuan says is very true. However, that&rsquo;s precisely the reason why it&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu nodded. However, shortly afterward, he added, &ldquo;Merely, the three remaining spirit formation swords will be very difficult for Linghu Hongfei to obtain. That&rsquo;s why&hellip; even if he has borrowed external forces today, he might still not necessarily become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, are the three remaining swords really that hard to obtain?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the four Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists all turned to Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Actually, their entire plan had been planned by Grandmaster Liangqiu alone. Their understanding of the grand formation was simply too inferior compared to his.<br>All they knew was that they would not be able to obtain the power of the grand formation with merely their power.<br>They must suppress the grand formation&rsquo;s power, and then have people of the younger generation breach the grand formation. Only in that way would they be able to obtain the power of the grand formation.<br>However, as for the reason why they had to do so, and the many secrets of the grand formation, they actually didn&rsquo;t have many clues.<br>&ldquo;For the remaining three swords, unless one&rsquo;s strength is heaven-defyingly powerful, it will be impossible to obtain them,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu said.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>After Grandmaster Liangqiu finished saying those words, the grand formation started trembling violently.<br>At that moment, the ground started to shatter and cave in. Thick smoke started surging about.<br>The people of the younger generation that were previously on the mountains immediately flew down from the mountains and arrived behind Linghu Hongfei with worried expressions on their faces.<br>They were all able to sense that there seemed to be some sort of terrifying being that was about to emerge from beneath the earth.<br>Sure enough, a huge monster slowly rose from beneath the earth.<br>That huge monster was thirty thousand meters tall, and looked like an enormous mountain.<br>However, it was not a mountain. Instead, it was an enormous monster.<br>The monster did not have a head. All it had was a humanoid body.<br>However, its body was over thirty thousand meters tall. It was truly a colossal monster!!!<br>Compared to it, the mountains containing spirit formations appeared minute.<br>It was even more so for the people of the younger generation under its feet.<br>Compared to its size, those people of the younger generation would not even be qualified to be ants. They were simply specks of dust.<br>Most importantly, the aura emitted by the colossal monster was simply too powerful. It was simply capable of showing disdain for everything, like an insurmountable god.<br>The reason for that was because&hellip; it was an Utmost Exalted!!!<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Why would there be such a terrifying being?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, didn&rsquo;t we already suppress the power of the grand formation? How could there still be such a powerful monster?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that huge monster, not to mention the people of the younger generation, even Queen Mother Fox Immortal and the other three Saint-cloak World Spiritists started to panic.<br>After all, that was an Utmost Exalted-level monster. Not to mention those people of the younger generation, even they would not be a match for it.<br>Amongst everyone present, only Grandmaster Liangqiu would be able to contend against that monster.<br>However, as they were suppressing the power of the grand formation, neither they nor Grandmaster Liangqiu would be able to enter the grand formation. Only the people of the younger generation could enter.<br>If they were to enter the grand formation, their suppression of the grand formation would lose its effect.<br>At that time, the power of that monster would increase by multiple times.<br>After all, its rank one Utmost Exalted-level power was the result of their suppression. It was not that monster&rsquo;s true power.<br>In other words, that monster was an existence that none of them could contend against.<br>In fact, it was an existence that no one in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield could contend against.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the second defensive perimeter of the grand formation. The remaining three spirit formation swords are all hidden within that monster. Naturally, it will be very difficult to handle,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu said.<br>&ldquo;What? The remaining three spirit formation swords are all guarded by that monster?&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing those words, Liangqiu Chengfeng and the other three finally realized why Grandmaster Liangqiu said Linghu Hongfei would not be able to obtain the remaining three spirit formation swords.<br>Not to mention Linghu Hongfei, no one could possibly obtain the remaining three spirit formation swords.<br>This challenge was simply too difficult.<br>Likely, no one in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield would be able to complete it.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, earlier, you said that the people of the younger generation, would be responsible for how much we gain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If Linghu Hongfei is only able to obtain two spirit formation swords, even if he manages to open that gate and enter it, he will only be able to obtain limited power. Would that power be sufficient for us to make breakthroughs?&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun asked.<br>At that moment, Grandmaster Long Xuan, Liangqiu Chengfeng and Queen Mother Fox Immortal also looked to Grandmaster Liangqiu with concerned expressions.<br>As the matter was of great importance, and concerned whether or not they would be able to make a breakthrough in their world spirit techniques and cultivation, they would naturally be extremely concerned about it.<br>&ldquo;Even I do not know exactly how strong that power is. As such, I cannot give a definitive answer.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps even if Linghu Hongfei is carrying only a single spirit formation sword to enter the gate, it would still be enough for us to make a breakthrough.&rdquo;<br>Hearing what Grandmaster Liangqiu said, the four Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists heaved a sigh of relief.<br>However, before they could start feeling joyous, Grandmaster Liangqiu added, &ldquo;However, it is also possible that the power is not as strong as we have anticipated it to be. Perhaps even if Linghu Hongfei enters with four spirit formation swords, it will still not be enough power for us to make breakthroughs.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
