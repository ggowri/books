        <h1>Chapter 4912</h1>
        <div>: Pleading Guilty<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, how dare you act so arrogantly in Lord Baimei&rsquo;s presence!&rdquo;<br>After being sent flying by Chu Feng&rsquo;s kick, Shengguang Xuanye managed to swiftly regain control over his body. He was trembling in fury, and his bellow could be clearly heard by everyone present.<br>&ldquo;You little beast! I&rsquo;ll personally send you to the depths of hell today!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xuanye furiously lurched toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;<br>Before he could even get close, a person suddenly rushed forward and blocked him. That person was Shengguang Baimei.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, t-this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xuanye was stunned. He noticed that Shengguang Baimei was glaring at him with eyes filled with anger. The crowd from the Holy Valley was also acting weirdly too.<br>Chu Feng was the one who kicked him earlier, so why was no one in the Holy Valley expressing their anger toward Chu Feng? Instead, it was almost as if he was the one who had done wrong here?<br>Now that he thought about it, the one who had sealed off his movement earlier seemed to be Shengguang Baimei.<br>Why would Shengguang Baimei limit his movement? Was he trying to save the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster?<br>There was something fishy going on here.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, I&rsquo;m addressing you as such in hopes that you can uphold justice here. The Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster is my elder, and he has once done me a huge favor. I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s right that he should be treated this way over my affairs. I&rsquo;ll leave it to you to decide how you wish to punish Shengguang Xuanye,&rdquo; Chu Feng said before refocusing his attention on treating the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Punish me? What a joke&hellip;&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye sneered.<br>He thought that it was funny how Chu Feng dared to say those words in the presence of those from the Holy Valley.<br>&ldquo;Shut your mouth, Shengguang Xuanye,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei bellowed.<br>Shengguang Xuanye was dumbstruck. He was so shocked that he actually looked a little pitiful for a moment there.<br>However, Shengguang Baimei couldn&rsquo;t care less. He turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, Shengguang Xuanye is a member of our Holy Light Clan, and he has indeed contributed greatly to the Holy Light Clan over the years. Would you be as magnanimous as to spare his life?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei addressed Chu Feng as &lsquo;young hero&rsquo;, and the tone he took had a pleading edge to it.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The crowd was flabbergasted, especially those from the Holy Light Clan.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Pah!<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to shut up? Do you have trouble understanding my words?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei sent a tight slap to Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;What are you waiting for? Kneel down to apologize to young hero Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>That wasn&rsquo;t just a perfunctory slap. A bright red fingerprint had sunk through Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s flesh to imprint directly onto his bone. Yet, Shengguang Xuanye dared not to voice any complaint. Without any hesitation, he kneeled in front of Chu Feng.<br>He had no idea what was going on, but he dared not to go against Shengguang Baimei.<br>Looking as Shengguang Xuanye, the overlord of the Holy Light Galaxy, kneeled in front of Chu Feng, the crowd widened their eyes in disbelief.<br>Even though they logically knew that the Holy Valley was a stronger power, they subconsciously placed Shengguang Xuanye on an even higher pedestal because they had been living under his shadow all this while.<br>It was hard for them to accept a figure whom they had feared for thousands of years to suddenly kneel down before a junior like Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s father has contributed greatly to our clan in his lifetime. His only dying wish was for the Holy Valley to ensure Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s safety regardless of what happens.<br>&ldquo;I know that we can&rsquo;t let Shengguang Xuanye off after what he has done, but we have our own difficulties too. I hope that you can be kind enough to spare his life.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei clasped his hand and bowed toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, Shengguang Baimei isn&rsquo;t lying. I also hope that you can spare Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s life too.&rdquo;<br>A voice transmission reached Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears. It was from Shengguang Buyu.<br>&ldquo;You can do as you please,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied coldly.<br>He didn&rsquo;t even bother raising his head. His eyes were focused on the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster all this while.<br>Even the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster was shocked by the situation. He couldn&rsquo;t even begin to imagine what Chu Feng had done to reverse the situation on Shengguang Xuanye. Just hearing Chu Feng speaking so disrespectfully to the powerhouses of the Holy Valley left him sweating buckets.<br>He would definitely be even more shocked if he knew that Shengguang Baimei was the one who was really sweating buckets right now.<br>He should have been a decisive figure in the Holy Valley, but he was actually put at a loss as to what he should do here.<br>In the end, it was Shengguang Buyu&rsquo;s voice transmission that gave him an idea as to what he should do.<br>He turned his eyes toward the powers gathered here today and said, &ldquo;People from the Holy Light Galaxy, I would like to first confirm that we, from the Holy Valley, are members of the Holy Light Clan too. It&rsquo;s just that we have chosen to go into seclusion so as to immerse ourselves in our cultivation.<br>&ldquo;The Holy Valley had no intention to interfere in the affairs of the Holy Light Galaxy, but we had no choice but to intervene when our clan member who ruled over the Holy Light Galaxy proved himself unworthy of his position.<br>&ldquo;Not only did he cause great distress to the people of the Holy Light Galaxy, but he also did nothing as the Holy Light Galaxy became looked down upon by the rest of the world. We have been reduced to nothing but a laughingstock in the world of cultivation!<br>&ldquo;If we wish to allocate blame, it isn&rsquo;t just the Holy Light Clan that is guilty here. We, of the Holy Valley, have to take responsibility for it too. However, as the overlord of the Holy Light Galaxy, Shengguang Xuanye takes the greatest share of the blame. He has let down the ancestors of our Holy Light Clan and the people of the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>&ldquo;Today, I shall have him confess to his sins before everyone. After that, I&rsquo;ll strip him of his position as the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and condemn him into the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s Revolution Prison!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>&ldquo;Revolution Prison?&rdquo;<br>Those of the Holy Light Clan turned pale, and some of those from other powers looked surprised. They knew just how terrifying the Revolution Prison was, and those who had been put in there would suffer fates worse than death.<br>Yet, Shengguang Xuanye was going to undergo such punishment? Was it really because of the evil deeds he had done thus far?<br>That didn&rsquo;t make sense. After all, Shengguang Baimei had previously stepped forward for Shengguang Xuanye. The more likely reason here was Chu Feng&rsquo;s interference.<br>&ldquo;Why, Lord Baimei? What have I done wrong to deserve such a fate?&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye exclaimed indignantly.<br>This was completely different from what he had envisioned.<br>He thought that the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s position would be reinforced with the emergence of the Holy Valley, allowing him to stand high and mighty once more. How did he become the first one to fall instead?<br>He did commit many atrocities while he was ruling over the Holy Light Galaxy, but that was all for the clan! He might be a sinner in the eyes of an outsider, but he was a loyal member of the Holy Light Clan. He shouldn&rsquo;t have deserved such a plight!<br>&ldquo;Admit to your sins!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei roared with upshot eyebrows.<br>Shengguang Xuanye dared not to disobey the order. He was truly afraid of Shengguang Baimei. As frightened as he was, he held back his tears and looked at the crowd.<br>&ldquo;I admit my guilt.&rdquo;<br>He was actually admitting to his sins!<br>&ldquo;Sss!&rdquo;<br>The members of the Holy Light Clan watched as their clan chief kneeled in front of everyone with his head lowered, spouting such words. They felt like someone had plunged a knife into their heart, and some of them began shedding tears.<br>That was their high and mighty clan chief, but he was now lowering his head to powers that even they looked down on.<br>They couldn&rsquo;t accept this!<br>But none of them dared to step forward to stop this mess. They dared not to go against the Holy Valley.<br>Even those from the other powers found it unbelievable. They doubted if what was happening before them was really true.<br>&ldquo;Men, bring Shengguang Xuanye to the Revolution Prison!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei ordered.<br>Several members of the Holy Valley quickly stepped forward and brought Shengguang Xuanye away with them.<br>Shengguang Xuanye had only suffered superficial injuries, but he didn&rsquo;t even have the strength to walk anymore. He had to be dragged away by the members of the Holy Valley.<br>Everyone knew why Shengguang Xuanye was in such a state. The mental trauma he had sustained was simply too great.<br>He had ruled over the Holy Light Galaxy for so many years, towering above all of them like a god. Yet, this was the plight that eventually befell him.<br>The crowd turned their sights toward Chu Feng.<br>They knew that it was this young man who resulted in Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s tragic downfall.<br>But just what did he do to make even the Holy Valley lower their heads to him?<br></p></div>
