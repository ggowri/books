        <h1>Chapter 3753</h1>
        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Trump Card<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although his words sounded very fierce, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen still considered it to be a joke.<br>They simply did not take Chu Feng&rsquo;s words to heart at all.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, if you are to dig out your own eyes, I will consider keeping your corpse whole," said Linghu Zhishi.<br>Chu Feng acted as if he did not hear Linghu Zhishi&rsquo;s words. He said, &ldquo;Clan Chief Linghu, remember this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The death of your Linghu Heavenly Clansmen here today is all thanks to you.&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng reacting in such a manner, the crowd felt that he had gone mad. They felt that he was simply blabbing crazy and unfounded ravings.<br>&ldquo;Has Chu Feng gone mad? What exactly is he talking about?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mad, he must&rsquo;ve gone mad.&rdquo;<br>Such words could be heard everywhere.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, in the following instant, a strange scene occurred.<br>A body of white light appeared before Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clansmen. Although that body of light was semi-transparent, it seemed like a boat, and had completely surrounded them.<br>That body of light did not only protect Chu Feng, Gu Mingyuan and the others.<br>Another such body of light had also appeared around the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that were imprisoned by the Linghu Heavenly Clan in the warship behind Linghu Zhishi.<br>Most importantly, after that body of light appeared, the crowd all felt their nerves tense up. The feeling emitted by that body of light was simply too powerful.<br>It was a sort of indestructible spirit formation!!!<br>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that spirit formation, the crowd all revealed looks of astonishment.<br>They were actually able to tell that it was a spirit formation. The reason why they asked what it was, was because they did not know where such a powerful spirit formation could come from.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Chu Feng!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, someone cried out in alarm. After hearing that person, the crowd all turned their gazes to Chu Feng.<br>Upon doing so, they discovered that there was a stick in his hand.<br>The stick itself did not appear to be particularly noteworthy at all. However, it was currently covered in white symbols and runes. Most importantly, those symbols and runes were very mystical. If one were to glance at them, one would not notice anything. However, if one were to pay close attention, one would notice that they contained unfathomable power.<br>&ldquo;That white protective formation was released by that stick?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What sort of treasure is that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually able to release such a powerful spirit formation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen imprisoned by the Linghu Heavenly Clan are being protected by that spirit formation. It's simply capable of moving about at will.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the vast sea of people that filled heaven and earth all burst into a complete uproar.<br>None of them were able to remain collected.<br>None of them had ever witnessed such a powerful treasure before.<br>At that moment, they finally understood why Chu Feng would dare to show up knowing full well that it was a death trap.<br>They also realized that he had not been speaking nonsense earlier.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had a trump card in his hands.<br>Not only was this trump card capable of protecting his own safety, but it was likely capable of protecting all of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen too.<br>The reason why the crowd felt this way was because they were capable of sensing how powerful that spirit formation was.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, did you really think that you&rsquo;d be able to protect them with that spirit formation?&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the crowd were all feeling astonished by the spirit formation, Linghu Zhishi&rsquo;s cold voice was heard.<br>His voice was still filled with contempt. Even though that spirit formation was very powerful, Linghu Zhishi still did not place it in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Linghu, why don&rsquo;t you personally experience how powerful this spirit formation of mine is?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;If I am to act, all of you will die,&rdquo; as Linghu Zhishi spoke, he released his rank two Utmost Exalted oppressive might.<br>Rank two Utmost Exalted, that was the strongest cultivation in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Linghu Zhishi&rsquo;s oppressive might wreaked havoc throughout the surroundings, sweeping away everything before its path.<br>As Linghu Zhishi was filled with anger, his oppressive might appeared particularly fierce.<br>He was planning to attack. Everyone knew that if Linghu Zhishi attacked, he would definitely unleash a massacre.<br>However, once he unleashed his oppressive might, his expression immediately changed.<br>Then, he turned his gaze behind him.<br>Following Linghu Zhishi&rsquo;s gaze, the crowd discovered that a body of light had appeared around Linghu Hongfei.<br>That body of light had enveloped him.<br>Even though that body of light was very small, and only capable of enveloping Linghu Hongfei alone, its shape and appearance was exactly the same as the light that had enveloped the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>Chu Feng not only protected the Chu Heavenly Clansmen using that body of light, but he was actually also able to envelop Linghu Hongfei using that same body of light.<br>Chu Feng was simply able to move that body of light around at his heart&rsquo;s desire.<br>That said, the crowd were very confused as to why he would envelop Linghu Hongfei in such a protective spirit formation.<br>Could Chu Feng possibly be planning to protect Linghu Hongfei?<br>But, why would he possibly do that? The crowd all knew very well how much Chu Feng hated him.<br>Was he taunting Linghu Hongfei?<br>Was he humiliating him?<br>These were the first things that came to the crowd&rsquo;s mind.<br>However, the body of light that had enveloped Linghu Hongfei suddenly began to contract.<br>As the body of light shrunk, the space Linghu Hongfei had to move in grew smaller and smaller. If this were to continue, he would be squeezed to death by that body of light.<br>With the situation being like that, Linghu Hongfei started to panic. He tried his best to push the body of light away. However, he was unable to move it in the slightest.<br>With that, Linghu Hongfei began to use various abilities to breach the body of light. Unfortunately, no matter what sort of ability he used, he was unable to stop it from shrinking.<br>At that moment, the crowd came to a sudden realization.<br>Chu Feng was not merely planning to humiliate Linghu Hongfei.<br>That spirit formation of his was not only capable of protecting people, but it was also capable of killing.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Linghu, are you still planning to stand around doing nothing? Do you want to watch as Linghu Hongfei is crushed to death?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng spoke with a beaming smile. Not only was he filled with indifference and ease, but his tone was even slightly ridiculing.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Linghu Zhishi let out a cold snort. Then, he extended his hands.<br>He formed blades with his hands and thrust them toward the protective formation.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>However, his thrust did not manage to pierce through the protective formation. Instead, the impact of his thrust sent the protective formation and Linghu Hongfei flying.<br>&ldquo;That spirit formation is actually that powerful?!&rdquo;<br>Even though the crowd had already felt the power of the spirit formation, they were still astonished to personally witness Linghu Zhishi being unable to breach it.<br>After all, that was Linghu Zhishi, the strongest expert in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Linghu Zhishi began to use all sorts of methods to try to breach the protective formation.<br>Unfortunately, they were all useless. Whether he used his weapon, martial skills or Immortal Techniques, they were all completely ineffective. The protective formation was simply impregnable.<br>Linghu Zhishi was simply incapable of destroying it.<br>In fact, he was unable to even cause the slightest amount of damage to it.<br>He could only look on helplessly as Linghu Hongfei screamed in pain as he continued to be squeezed tighter and tighter by the protective formation...<br>Although he was the strongest expert in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, he was completely powerless to do anything.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that he didn&rsquo;t wish to save Linghu Hongfei. Rather&hellip; he simply did not possess the ability to save him.<br></p></div>
