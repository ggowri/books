        <div> - A Scream<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Could it be that Lady Chu Lingxi hasn't heard of the fact that there are special powers enveloping Buried Spirit Lake, making it so that one cannot set up spirit formations here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Moreover, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan has a rule. That is, when Buried Spirit Lake is open to the public, they will never set foot inside.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the others, they are simply unable to reach here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because the flying insects were practically all captured by Chu Feng. Even if others are to discover the key to reaching this place, they will have no opportunity to actually come here,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said. She was very confident.<br>As she spoke, she gracefully entered the lake bare naked.<br>&ldquo;Do whatever you want,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi left those words and then proceeded further into Buried Spirit Lake on her own.<br>Seeing that, Xia Yun&rsquo;er smiled charmingly. Then, she followed after Chu Lingxi, and also proceeded further into Buried Spirit Lake. Soon, she caught up to Chu Lingxi.<br>Although one must indeed soak one&rsquo;s body completely in the lake in order to obtain comprehension in Buried Spirit Lake, the origin of Buried Spirit Lake was definitely not as simple as the rumors had.<br>A lot of people had indeed died there. The depths of Buried Spirit Lake were truly an underwater cemetery.<br>Regardless of what level one&rsquo;s cultivation might be, as long as one crossed over to where one shouldn&rsquo;t, one would die in Buried Spirit Lake and never return.<br>No one knew where the boundary was. Thus, Chu Lingxi and Xia Yun&rsquo;er did not dare to enter too deep either.<br>&ldquo;Lady Chu Lingxi, I am not lying to you. After removing one&rsquo;s clothes, one will truly be able to comprehend the mysteriousness of Buried Spirit Lake more easily.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You and I are both women, there is no need for you to be embarrassed. You should also remove your clothes,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said to Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Regardless of men or women, I've never had a habit of being naked before anyone,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine with women. As for men, I too have never shown myself naked before any of them,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;Is that so? In that case, if a man were to enter this place and just so happened to see your naked body, what would you do?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;Regardless of who it might be, as long as it&rsquo;s a man that doesn't have my permission to see me naked that saw me naked, I will first dig out his eyes, and then cut out his tongue. After that, I will dismember his body into ten thousand pieces,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;Why dig out the eyes first and then cut out the tongue before killing him? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be more simple to just kill him directly?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked.<br>&ldquo;He shall be punished for seeing what he shouldn&rsquo;t have,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Lingxi revealed a faint smile on her face.<br>She became even more certain that Xia Yun&rsquo;er was a ruthless woman.<br>However, Chu Lingxi did not dislike ruthless women. After all, from a certain viewpoint, she too was a ruthless woman.<br>&ldquo;Lady Chu Lingxi, it is about to erupt now. You should close your eyes, concentrate and wait for the arrival of the eruption. It will help you better obtain comprehension,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that it&rsquo;s not the first time you&rsquo;ve been here? You actually managed to tell that the eruption is about to come from the ripples in the water?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi was surprised.<br>&ldquo;It would seem that is is also not the first time that Lady Chu Lingxi has been here? In that case, my advice earlier was not needed,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>At that moment, Chu Lingxi and Xia Yun&rsquo;er looked at one another and smiled. They felt that since the two of them were both people with secrets, there was no need for them to question one another further.<br>After that, the two of them closed their eyes and began to set up a formation within their palms. That formation was to be used during the eruption. It would help one obtain better comprehension in the lake.<br>Due to the fact that the two of them were focused on waiting for the arrival of the eruption, they did not notice that a figure had managed to pass through the stone forest and was approaching Buried Spirit Lake.<br>As for that person, it was naturally Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That should be Buried Spirit Lake, right?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; At that moment, Chu Feng also had a joyous expression on his face. In the end, he had not made this journey in vain.<br>&ldquo;However, why is Xia Yun&rsquo;er nowhere to be seen?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;This lake&rsquo;s water is special. Even though it appears to be extremely clear, one is simply unable to see what happens below. Xia Yun&rsquo;er&hellip; should be deep underneath the water,&rdquo; Chu Feng analyzed.<br>&ldquo;That girl is extremely shrewd. There are most definitely benefits for her to go deep underwater. Chu Feng, you should go deep underwater too,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;Mn, that was also my thought,&rdquo; As spoke, he leapt into the air and entered Buried Spirit Lake.<br>Chu Feng felt that Xia Yun&rsquo;er should know more about the secrets concerning Buried Spirit Lake. Thus, the location where Xia Yun&rsquo;er stayed should be more beneficial to comprehending the mysteries of Buried Spirit Lake.<br>Thus, after Chu Feng entered Buried Spirit Lake, he continued to dive down the entire time. His intention was to find Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>However, not long after Chu Feng dove into the lake, he stopped. At the same time, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes were opened extremely wide. Disbelief filled his eyes.<br>Chu Feng was looking downward. He saw two people down below. They were Chu Lingxi and Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>Chu Feng only knew that Xia Yun&rsquo;er had entered Buried Spirit Lake before him. He had never expected for Chu Lingxi to be there too.<br>Although Chu Lingxi being there was a surprise to Chu Feng, it was not enough to make Chu Feng react in such a manner.<br>The reason for Chu Feng&rsquo;s reaction was Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>After all, the current Xia Yun&rsquo;er was completely naked; she was not wearing anything at all.<br>Her perfect body and flawless skin were completely exposed to Chu Feng&rsquo;s line of sight.<br>Her perfect body underneath the water was simply akin to the most beautiful scenery.<br>&ldquo;Woah. Although that girl is a sinister and treacherous individual, her skin, figure and overall appearance are truly excellent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mn, this Queen determines that Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s reputation as one of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s Three Great Beauties is well-deserved.&rdquo;<br>Her Lady Queen shared Chu Feng&rsquo;s sight and hearing. Thus, she saw everything that Chu Feng saw.<br>At that moment, Her Lady Queen had a mischievous smile on her face. She knew that with Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s personality, she would definitely feel extremely ashamed should she know that her naked body was exposed to Chu Feng.<br>Likely, this would be something extremely painful for Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>Even though this was merely a coincidence and not something that Chu Feng did deliberately, it could still be considered as Chu Feng having obtained his revenge. As such, Her Lady Queen would naturally be cheerful.<br>After seeing Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s naked body, Chu Feng was truly astonished.<br>Perhaps because he hadn&rsquo;t seen such a charming body in such a long time, Chu Feng was actually stunned.<br>In that sort of circumstance, Chu Feng&rsquo;s natural male instinct actually revealed itself. Thus, Chu Feng did not say anything, but started to concentratedly size up Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>The more he looked, the more fond of Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s body Chu Feng became. Unable to contain himself, Chu Feng swallowed a mouthful of saliva.<br>&ldquo;Gulp~~~&rdquo;<br>The gulping sound alarmed Xia Yun&rsquo;er and Chu Lingxi, whose eyes were closed.<br>Neither one of them had ever imagined that someone would appear in this place. Thus, they subconsciously opened their eyes and glanced upward.<br>&ldquo;Ahhhhh!!!!&rdquo;<br>The next moment, a sharp scream was heard.<br>That scream was filled with terror, fear and embarrassment.<br>It was Xia Yun&rsquo;er. When Xia Yun&rsquo;er saw Chu Feng standing in the nearby water staring at her with shining eyes, her face instantly turned deep red, and even her fair skin reddened.<br>After that scream, Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s body immediately moved. She rapidly dove deeper into the water.<br><br><br>Check out the June Giveaway for a chance to win $200, $100 or $50 Visa Gift Card<br><br></p></div>
