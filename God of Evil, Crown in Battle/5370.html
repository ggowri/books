        <div><span>: Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s Portrait</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;What does us going to the Ancient Palace have to do with the Divine Inheritance Ground?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The land we are standing on is already the Divine Inheritance Ground, but the Ancient Palace is the heart of the Divine Inheritance Ground. There are rumors that the true legacy of the Divine Inheritance Ground lies inside the Ancient Palace.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Thus far, there has only been a single person who has reached the final floor of the Ancient Palace, and that person is none other than Lord Jie Ranqing. However, even Lord Jie Ranqing wasn&rsquo;t able to decipher the secret behind the Ancient Palace,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Even Lord Jie Ranqing couldn&rsquo;t decipher the secret?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing was astonished, especially since he saw Jie Ranqing as an infallible figure.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is the Ancient Palace we&rsquo;re entering the same one that Lord Jie Ranqing has challenged?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course. There&rsquo;s only one Ancient Palace here,&rdquo; Jie Yu replied with a smile.</span><br><span>Chu Feng clenched his fists in excitement. Entering the places where his mother had been might not be much of a deal to the current him, but it was not too long ago that his mother was far beyond his reach. He saw this as a sign that he was slowly coming close to his mother.</span><br><span>He made up his mind to enter the Ancient Palace. Even if it wasn&rsquo;t the core of the Divine Inheritance Ground, just the fact that his mother had been there before was more than enough reason for him to pay it a visit.</span><br><span>Who knows? He might just find traces of his mother there.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is it really fine for me to enter such an important place?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked worriedly.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Truth be told, I tried asking Lord Shuang Yu to allow you to enter the Ancient Palace together with me, but she turned me down. However, Ling Sheng&rsquo;er&rsquo;s words carry much greater weight than mine. Her grandfather is a grand elder of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, as well as the leader of the Ling Clan Lineage. On top of that, Ling Sheng&rsquo;er also possesses incredible talents. Many say that her talents are second to only Lord Jie Ranqing, and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before she overtakes Ling Xiao. You&rsquo;ll definitely be able to enter the Ancient Palace if she&rsquo;s vouching for you,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That girl was that formidable? What&rsquo;s the relationship between Ling Sheng&rsquo;er and Ling Mo&rsquo;er?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ling Sheng&rsquo;er is Ling Mo&rsquo;er&rsquo;s younger sister,&rdquo; Jie Yu replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ah, I thought that their names sounded similar. So, she is Ling Mo&rsquo;er&rsquo;s younger sister, and her talent surpasses hers?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Ling Mo&rsquo;er is also here, and she&rsquo;ll be entering the Ancient Palace too,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Woah! It really is a gathering of prodigies,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing exclaimed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are only juniors allowed into the Ancient Palace?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t an age limit to the Ancient Palace, but the difficulty is determined by the cultivation of those entering the premises. To avoid raising the difficulty level, only juniors will be entering this time around,&rdquo; Jie Yu replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are the Ling Mo&rsquo;er and Ling Sheng&rsquo;er the strongest ones in the party this time around?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Based on what I know, Ling Sheng&rsquo;er is at Blue Dragon God-cloak, whereas Ling Mo&rsquo;er is at Purple Dragon God-cloak. There&rsquo;ll also be another Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist named Jie Zhou,&rdquo; Jie Yu replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Jie Zhou? I&rsquo;ve never heard of him,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>Jie Yu laughed upon hearing those words. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t underestimate Jie Zhou. He&rsquo;s older than Ling Mo&rsquo;er and Ling Sheng&rsquo;er, but he&rsquo;s also a highly talented prodigy too. In fact, his standing is even higher than Ling Mo&rsquo;er and Ling Sheng&rsquo;er here, for he is the prophesied child.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Prophesied child?&rdquo; Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing were intrigued by the use of the term.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you earlier that no one has been able to decipher the secret of the Divine Inheritance Ground, including Lord Jie Ranqing? It goes without saying that our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion wishes to get our hand on this secret, for it might be a formidable world spiritist legacy. For that, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has been trying to prophesize about this land but to no avail. It was only after Jie Zhou was born that a prophecy was finally made that suggests that he might have the key to deciphering this secret,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;So, Jie Zhou could be the one to uncover this Divine Inheritance Ground&rsquo;s secret?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the prophecy says, but of course, prophecies aren&rsquo;t always reliable. Nevertheless, the prophecy itself entitled Jie Zhou to resources comparable to Ling Sheng&rsquo;er, Ling Xiao, and the others,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Eyy!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing sighed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;If only I could enter the Ancient Tower too! I don&rsquo;t bear any expectations about deciphering the secret, but it would be wonderful if I could just take a look around,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>Jie Yu burst into laughter. &ldquo;You will need charisma like Brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s to charm Ling Sheng&rsquo;er. On that topic, Brother Chu Feng, how did you win Ling Sheng&rsquo;er&rsquo;s </span><span>acknowledgment?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I provided her with some pointers on her martial cultivation,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all?&rdquo; Jie Yu was doubtful.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied. He turned to Bai Yunqing and said, &ldquo;You should come with us tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll ask her if we could bring you along too.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing was excited to hear that.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is this fine?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Jie Yu.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We can bring him over, but I don&rsquo;t have the power to say whether he gets to enter the Ancient Tower or not,&rdquo; Jie Yu replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;No worries. We&rsquo;re just taking a chance anyway,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Indeed! There&rsquo;s no harm trying,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing chirped in.</span><br><span>&ldquo;All right then.&rdquo; Jie Yu nodded.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Jie Yu, I have long heard about Senior Jie Ranqing, but I have never met her before. Just out of curiosity, do you have a portrait of her?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I want to see her portrait too!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You have never seen her before?&rdquo; Chu Feng was surprised to hear those words. Considering how well-versed Bai Yunqing was in such matters, he should have at least seen Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s portrait before.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course not! Lord Jie Ranqing never shows her true appearance to others, so very few people know what she truly looks like,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was disappointed to hear that. He thought that he could finally get to see what his mother looked like, but who could have thought that it would be so difficult to even get a portrait of her?</span><br><span>It was then that Jie Yu chuckled gleefully and replied, &ldquo;You asked the right person. I do have a portrait of Lord Jie Ranqing, and you can be sure that it&rsquo;s the real deal. It was painted before she went into closed-door training, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be too far off.&rdquo;</span><br><span>As he said those words, he took out a portrait.</span><br></p></div>
