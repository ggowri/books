        <h1>Chapter 3046</h1>
        <div> - A Crack<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>The Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground was as Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi had described, and possessed a special sort of restrictive power.<br>Being inside it, one would not only be unable to fly, but one&rsquo;s power would also be greatly restricted.<br>That said, Chu Feng was, after all, a Heavenly Immortal. Thus, while he was unable to fly, his body was still very robust.<br>Thus, even though he was facing an extremely deep ravine, Chu Feng landed at the bottom of the ravine with a mere leap.<br>&ldquo;This feeling,&rdquo; upon landing at the bottom, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>He actually noticed some abnormal behavior from a treasure within his Cosmos Sack.<br>Chu Feng immediately took out a bracelet from his Cosmos Sack.<br>The bracelet he took out was extremely shabby. It was simply akin to scrap metal.<br>Compared to that bracelet, the Utmost Exalted Wrist Protector on Chu Feng&rsquo;s right hand that resembled a copper bracelet looked much more exquisite.<br>That said, the shabby bracelet possessed a very extraordinary name. It was called the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet.<br>That Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet was something that Chu Feng had obtained in the Grand Auction Assembly.<br>Reportedly, the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet possessed heaven-defying power, and contained a special mysteryrealm.<br>Should one enter the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet, even those with extremely lacking talent for martial cultivation would be granted martial cultivation and nurtured into powerful cultivators.<br>However, those were merely rumors. At the very least, the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand simply did not possess that sort of power.<br>That said, a subtle change was happening to the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet at that moment.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng immediately took out the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet and began to inspect it upon landing at the bottom of the ravine, Her Lady Queen asked in a confused manner, &ldquo;Chu Feng, what are you doing? Why are you looking at that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eggy, it seems like a change is happening to my Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that it seems like, it really is happening,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Change? What sort of change?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to explain. However, it seems that this Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet is capable of guiding me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Guiding you?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s expression changed upon hearing those words. She then asked, &ldquo;Could it be that your Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet is related to the Abyss Elf Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure about that. However, I feel that there should be something that is attracting the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; At that moment, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi also leaped down and arrived beside Chu Feng.<br>The two of them did not know about the conversation between Chu Feng and Her Lady Queen. They were only able to see Chu Feng holding a shabby bracelet in his hand and standing there motionlessly. As such, they thought something was wrong with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, I am fine. Merely, this place might not be as simple as we expected it to be.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is best for the two of you to not enter far into the ravine. Just stay here and wait for me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Chu Feng was afraid of encountering dangers and being unable to protect Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi.<br>As Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi were experienced people, they understood Chu Feng&rsquo;s intention and didn&rsquo;t want to become a burden to him. Thus, they did not say anything and stayed there, allowing Chu Feng to move forward by himself.<br>Continuing onward, Chu Feng did not encounter anything special. Even the natural energies remained the same and without change.<br>However, the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet on Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand was changing constantly.<br>Chu Feng felt as if there were some sort of thing calling for the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet. Furthermore, the deeper Chu Feng traveled, the closer he came to the thing that was calling to the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet.<br>Following the change to the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet was like following a pointer that was telling him to continue forward.<br>Finally, Chu Feng entered a remote forest.<br>Actually, instead of calling it remote, it would be more accurate to say that it was somewhat eerie.<br>Before entering the forest, it did not feel or look any different from all the other locations in the Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground.<br>It was very beautiful, as all of the plants in the forest were very special. Even though those plants did not give off any splendorous light, their outward appearances were already extremely pleasing to look at.<br>This held true for the trees inside the forest too.<br>However, the moment Chu Feng entered the forest, an eerie aura immediately assaulted his senses and engulfed him completely.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng felt as if he was no longer in the Elf Clan&rsquo;s Sacred Ground, and had instead entered a different place. This sort of sensation made Chu Feng feel very uneasy.<br>However, Chu Feng did not mention anything to Her Lady Queen. Instead, he decided to endure the feeling of unease, this slightly stifling sensation, all by himself. The reason for that was because Chu Feng did not want Her Lady Queen to worry about him.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng, with his temperament, was determined to get to the bottom of this.<br>As Chu Feng went deeper into the forest, even the trees in the forest changed.<br>The trees in the forest grew thicker and thicker, and looked more and more sinister.<br>At a glance, they resembled demon faces.<br>In fact, Chu Feng even felt as if there were eyes looking at him.<br>However, no matter how much Chu Feng observed, no matter how much he sensed his surroundings, he was unable to detect any traces of life.<br>There was simply nothing in the vicinity at all.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was looking around incessantly, and even seemed to be tense, Her Lady Queen was unable to contain her curiosity, and asked, "Chu Feng, what's wrong? Did you discover anything?"<br>"I'm fine. I'm merely feeling a bit lost. However, it's nothing serious," Chu Feng explained.<br>He was worried that Her Lady Queen would refuse to allow him to continue onward should he inform her of the uneasy, trifling and even strange feeling he was having in that forest.<br>"Chu Feng, why is it that I'm feeling this place to be somewhat amiss?" Her Lady Queen said.<br>"What's amiss about this place? It's very normal," Chu Feng said.<br>"It's difficult to explain. Regardless, I feel this place to be very strange. However, I am unable to explain what's strange about it. In short, you must be careful. Earlier, this Queen felt that the Abyss Elf Clan's disappearance must be because they'd decided to move. After all, there's no trace of them having lived in this place. Thus, they must've deliberately erased all traces of their existence here."<br>"However, I now suddenly feel that it is not that simple. In short, you must be careful. If you are to feel anything being amiss, you must stop proceeding onward, turn around and leave immediately," Her Lady Queen warned.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng gasped in his heart at how amazing Her Lady Queen was.<br>Even though she only shared his vision and hearing, and was unable to sense what he was feeling, Her Lady Queen's observational abilities had revealed to her that the forest was dangerous.<br>Dangerous, that place was naturally dangerous. Even though it did not give off a very obvious dangerous sensation, the strange sensation it gave off had signaled to Chu Feng how dangerous it was.<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng continued onward. Ultimately, he discovered a crack in the surface of the forest.<br><br><br></p></div>
