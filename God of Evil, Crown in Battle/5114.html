        <div>: Regret In Your Dreams<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;He escaped?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was surprised to hear that.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. Before he ran away, he personally instructed these people to construct palaces for your Chu Heavenly Clan. This gesture was a way for them to make amends for their folly. It showed the sincerity of our Holy Light Clan, so I didn&rsquo;t stop them after learning about it. Pardon me for not informing you about this beforehand.<br>&ldquo;About Shengguang Xuanye, I&rsquo;ve already dispatched members of the Holy Valley to look for him. We&rsquo;ll definitely punish him harshly once we capture him, so I ask you not to be worried about it,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu said.<br>He appeared to be rather afraid of Chu Feng, judging by how he was sweating buckets as he said those words.<br>Chu Feng felt apologetic seeing Shengguang Buyu acting in such a meek manner. The grudge between him and Shengguang Xuanye had nothing to do with Shengguang Buyu, and Shengguang Buyu had helped him many times in the past when he was still weak.<br>He was earnestly grateful to Shengguang Buyu, and he respected the latter as an elder.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I remember all the help you have given me. You could have just told me this earlier. There&rsquo;s no need for you to be so reserved with me. Whatever Shengguang Xuanye did has nothing to do with you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a gentle voice.<br>Nevertheless, he turned to Chu Lingxi afterward and said, &ldquo;Lingxi, do me a favor and remove all of the palaces constructed by the Holy Light Clan later on.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi replied.<br>She didn&rsquo;t know the rationale behind that, but she had already decided that she would unconditionally abide by Chu Feng&rsquo;s instructions.<br>Following that, Chu Feng turned to an elder of the Holy Light Clan. His gaze and his voice noticeably turned cold.<br>&ldquo;If anyone should be making amends, it is Shengguang Xuanye himself. The group of you have no reason to be here. Leave my Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>He knew that these people were loyal to Shengguang Xuanye, so he didn&rsquo;t show them any good attitude. He wasn&rsquo;t so magnanimous as to show respect to Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s lackeys.<br>Shengguang Baimei suddenly spoke up at this moment.<br>&ldquo;What the hell? Why are you heeding the orders of a sinner? You deserve to be punished for such absurd foolishness! Return to the Holy Light Clan right now and enter the Revolution Prison on your own accord! If you dare disobey my order, I&rsquo;ll make sure to hunt each and every one of you down!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei bellowed.<br>He appeared to be unaware of this matter, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t have lost his temper.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, please spare us!&rdquo;<br>The Holy Light Clansmen immediately dropped to their knees and begged for mercy. Being put in the Revolution Prison was no different from a death sentence to them.<br>&ldquo;Forget it, there&rsquo;s no need to punish them. Just get them to leave this place,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What are you waiting for? Hurry up and thank young hero Chu Feng!&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu said.<br>He also thought that there was no need to impose such harsh punishment for this matter.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for sparing us, young hero Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>The Holy Light Clansmen did as they were told and hurriedly thanked Chu Feng with quivering voices. The earlier sentence from Shengguang Baimei nearly scared their souls out of them.<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Buyu, don&rsquo;t interfere in this matter!&rdquo;<br>However, Shengguang Baimei was unwilling to let this matter rest just like that.<br>&ldquo;Forget it, Elder Baimei,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re really&hellip; Haa, forget it. Let&rsquo;s go with your wishes.&rdquo;<br>Since Chu Feng had already decided to spare these people, Shengguang Baimei decided not to push on with his punishment. Still, he looked at the Holy Light Clansmen and said, &ldquo;Listen well. From now onward, your master is the Holy Valley, not Shengguang Xuanye. If I ever learn that any of you are still obeying his orders, I&rsquo;ll skin you alive!&rdquo;<br>The Holy Light Clansmen nervously kowtowed and expressed that they wouldn&rsquo;t make such a mistake anymore.<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to waste his time with the Holy Light Clan. He turned to the Darknight Sacred River and began examining it.<br>However, the crowd understood many things from the earlier conflict. They learned that Shengguang Xuanye had been imprisoned for offending Chu Feng, and the Holy Light Clan was currently incredibly afraid of Chu Feng.<br>While Chu Feng had reached Half-God level, which made it no surprise why the Holy Light Clan was afraid of him, Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s fearsome reputation was deeply seeded in the hearts of all cultivators in the Holy Light Galaxy. It came as a huge shock to them when they saw the Holy Light Clan tremble fearfully in front of Chu Feng.<br>This was especially so for two women standing at the edge of the crowd. The shock came far more vividly to them than anyone else. Even though they looked like small fries amongst everyone else gathered in this area, they were actually acquainted with Chu Feng.<br>They were a pair of sisters from the Gong Heavenly Clan, and their names were Gong Mingyue and Gong Qing.<br>Gong Qing had some ties with Chu Feng, which was why she was excited when she saw Chu Feng&rsquo;s current accomplishment. In contrast, her older sister, Gong Mingyue, had an awful look on her face as she wasn&rsquo;t on good terms with Chu Feng.<br>Gong Mingyue deeply regretted her foolishness. If only she had grasped her opportunity back then, she would have been on closer terms with Chu Feng than anyone else, including her younger sister.<br>The Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, who was also her grandfather, was close friends with the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. He greatly admired Chu Xuanyuan, to the point that he made a deal with the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to betroth one of his grandchildren to Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s child even before Chu Xuanyuan brought Chu Feng back.<br>As a result, Gong Mingyue became Chu Feng&rsquo;s fiancee.<br>However, Gong Mingyue had a poor first impression of Chu Feng, which led to her holding him in contempt. She eventually publicly refuted her engagement with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Big sister, do you regret what you did back then now that Chu Feng has risen to such heights?&rdquo; Gong Qing suddenly asked.<br>She was a candid person who spoke whatever that was on her mind.<br>Gong Mingyue didn&rsquo;t say a word at all, but she felt a sharp pain in her chest.<br>She had already regretted her action back when she witnessed Chu Feng&rsquo;s fight with Linghu Hongfei while they were still at Nine Dragons Upper Realm. The unbelievable heights that Chu Feng had reached only further intensified that feeling, to the point where she thought her guts were going to rot from sheer regret.<br>While she was also respected as a young miss of the Gong Heavenly Clan, she wasn&rsquo;t even qualified to come close to the Darknight Sacred River. In contrast, Chu Feng was in a position where even the overlords of the Holy Light Galaxy had to kneel to him.<br>It was almost as if Chu Feng was the true sovereign of this galaxy.<br>No, the title &lsquo;sovereign&rsquo; was an understatement. Chu Feng was more like a god who could dictate their fate at a moment&rsquo;s whim.<br>Even the Wuming Clan and the other powerhouses were mere ants before the Holy Light Clan. She was nothing more than an ant amongst the ants here. A mere bystander who could only watch the commotion hiding behind the crowd.<br>Countless times she had dreamt of Chu Feng, bringing her back to their first meeting together. She knew that Chu Feng would become a great person in the future, so she would always get together with him in the dream, eventually becoming a couple envied by the others.<br>A pity it was that her wish could only be realized in her dreams. There were no pills she could eat in the world that could grant her a second chance.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t notice Gong Mingyue and Gong Qing as they were standing far away, but even if he did, he would have only waved to Gong Qing.<br>His attention was fully focused on the Darknight Sacred River. A moment later, he retracted his gaze.<br>&ldquo;The Darknight Sacred River is now open, but it&rsquo;ll likely close within sixteen hours. If you intend to enter the river, I&rsquo;d advise you to keep track of the time. I don&rsquo;t know if there will be any other exits you can leave the Darknight Sacred River by after this one closes,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Following that, he turned to Shengguang Baimei and the others, asking, &ldquo;Elders, do you wish to head in with me to take a look?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I came here out of boredom, but the formidable might of the Darknight Sacred River has piqued my curiosity. I&rsquo;ll regret it if I don&rsquo;t head in and take a look,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>Shengguang Buyu, Gu Mingyuan, Chu Lingxi, and the others also expressed their intent to visit the Darknight Sacred River.<br>Chu Feng then turned his gaze toward Long Daozhi, Kong Tianhui, Xia Yun&rsquo;er, Li Ruochu, and the others.<br></p></div>
