        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Little Fishy raised her head. Chu Feng&rsquo;s face could be seen reflected in her beautiful eyes as she assessed him from head to toe.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was also assessing Little Fishy.</span><br><span>He had to admit that Little Fishy had changed a lot, but he could still find traces of the old her in her delicate face. It was often said that a woman transformed at eighteen, but that didn&rsquo;t apply to Little Fishy. She had been beautiful from a young age.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was overjoyed to see Little Fishy not because of how beautiful she was, but that a young child he had met back then had matured into a lady. Looking back, he wasn&rsquo;t the same young man he used to be either.</span><br><span>Of course, the reunion of old friends was something to be celebrated as well, especially for cultivators. Given how huge the world of cultivation was, most farewells were eternal. It was only after going through a lot himself that he knew how hard it was to reunite with old friends.</span><br><span>Hm?</span><br><span>Chu Feng suddenly nervously retracted his face, for Little Fishy abruptly leaned toward him. She was so close that they would kiss if she just got a bit closer.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha! What are you doing, big brother? I just wanted to take a closer look at you. Why are you dodging? </span><span>Ehh</span><span>, you can&rsquo;t be thinking that I was planning to kiss you?&rdquo; Little Fishy asked with a mischievous smile. Her personality hadn&rsquo;t changed in the least.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was put in an awkward position by those words. He quickly changed the topic and asked, &ldquo;Do you think that I have changed a lot over the years?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Not at all. Big brother, you&rsquo;re still the same as ever. Exactly as I remembered you,&rdquo; Little Fishy replied with a smile.</span><br><span>Her smile had changed a little from before. It was no longer a mischievous smile but one of fondness.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother, what brought you here? How did you turn into a formation entity? Also&hellip;&rdquo; Little Fishy glanced at Chu Feng&rsquo;s identification number, only to suddenly realize something. &ldquo;Big brother, you&rsquo;re 521! Are you the one who constructed this formation armor for me?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>He explained everything that had happened to her, from the reason he had come here to the events that had transpired after he transformed into a formation entity. Naturally, he also told her about Jie Tian&rsquo;s current condition.</span><br><span>Surprisingly, Little Fishy wasn&rsquo;t flustered in the least despite having learned that Jie Tian had become stronger after siphoning the shell&rsquo;s energy to enhance his own formation armor.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, big brother. I&rsquo;m not afraid of him. Let me bring you to a place.&rdquo;</span><br><span>She dragged Chu Feng into the air with her, and the two of them soared side by side </span><span>through the clouds. The scenery beneath them continuously changed, from mountain ranges, a barren wilderness, to forests&hellip;</span><br><span>When they finally passed through a vast forest, the scenery before them suddenly opened up.</span><br><span>A boundless ocean appeared before their eyes. Its water twinkled with starlight as if someone had poured the stars in the sky into this ocean. It was already nighttime, so both the sky and the water shone with brilliant starlight.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Woohoo!&rdquo;</span><br><span>With a joyful cry, Little Fishy leaped into the ocean together with Chu Feng. It was hard to tell whether her joy originated from her fondness of the ocean or that she was reminiscing about her first meeting with Chu Feng, but she seemed more excited than usual.</span><br><span>Even Chu Feng could clearly feel her joy.</span><br><span>What was worth mentioning was that her traveling speed became much faster than before after she entered the ocean. Even the aura of her formation armor changed too. It looked like her true strength only shone in the ocean.</span><br><span>The ocean was vast, but Little Fishy had a clear destination in mind. They quickly arrived before a coral reef. Inside the coral reef was a labyrinth, but Little Fishy navigated it without a hitch.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Something is off. Why is that lass going in circles?&rdquo; Eggy asked in confusion.</span><br><span>She noticed that Little Fishy wasn&rsquo;t solving the labyrinth at all despite her decisive movements. Rather, she was going in circles.</span><br><span>&ldquo;No, she seems to be doing it intentionally.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Eggy soon realized that Little Fishy wasn&rsquo;t trapped by the labyrinth but that she was deciphering it in a unique fashion.</span><br><span>Soon, the corals started shining with increasing intensity. All of a sudden, a blinding light coming from the front blocked their line of sight.</span><br><span>Little Fishy and Chu Feng dived through the blinding light to arrive at an underwater world.</span><br><span>They had been brought to a city in the midst of the ocean. Interestingly, the city didn&rsquo;t contain water, though its perimeter was still surrounded by water.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was stunned by the sight of the city. The city was moving, fueled by the energy coming from an incomparably powerful formation. As for how powerful this formation was&hellip;</span><br><span>He had known from the start that the Star Sea Realm had a powerful pool of spirit power lying beneath its surface, and this incomparably powerful formation was its very origin. The energy fueling the entire Star Sea Realm originated from this place.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Little Fishy, how did you stumble upon this place?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>He figured that this was a place that even the formation entities who had lived in the Star Sea Realm for a long time were unaware of.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother, I have known about this place even though it&rsquo;s my first time here. I also know a way to survive in the Star Memorial Domain without relying on the formation armor. I received this information when I cleared the Immemorial Star Sea&rsquo;s trial,&rdquo; Little Fishy said with a smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Does Jie Tian know as well?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>He knew that Jie Tian and Little Fishy had entered the Star Sea Realm by clearing the trial. Considering that Jie Tian was a powerful world spiritist, It would be disastrous if he knew about this too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way he could know about this,&rdquo; Little Fishy replied with a gleeful smirk.</span><br><span>Chu Feng finally understood why Little Fishy was not afraid despite knowing that Jie Tian had grown stronger through the shell&rsquo;s energy.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you able to receive a benefit from this place?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>As powerful as the formation here was, Little Fishy wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to decipher it as she wasn&rsquo;t a world spiritist. He wanted to know what she was going to do.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I think so. It should strengthen my formation armor, and I might be able to obtain the right way to open the palace too. However, I&rsquo;m not too certain about it. Give me a moment, big brother. I&rsquo;ll give it a try,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span><br><span>But instead of setting off right away, she looked at Chu Feng with a smile.</span><br><span>She was clearly waiting for him to compliment her, though she wouldn&rsquo;t behave in such a manner before others. For instance, from the formation space earlier, he had seen how coldly she had treated Jie Tian.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a nod.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Heh!&rdquo; Little Fishy revealed a sweet smile before heading straight toward the formation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Little Fishy!!!&rdquo; Chu Feng was stunned and hurriedly shouted for her to stop.</span><br><span>The energy inside the formation was so great that it was nothing short of foolishness to force one&rsquo;s way in.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, big brother. I did clear the trial,&rdquo; Little Fishy reassured Chu Feng with a smile.</span><br><span>A light that resonated with the formation shone from Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> body.</span><br><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart was finally put at ease. That was probably some kind of unique energy she had received from clearing the trial that allowed her to enter the formation without any issues.</span><br><span>As expected, she was able to slip into the formation without any problems.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was no longer able to see how Little Fishy was faring from this point onward, so he could only patiently wait for her outside. However, he didn&rsquo;t idle around but instead examined the formation.</span><br><span>While the formation wasn&rsquo;t specifically prepared for him, it was the source of the underground spirit power, after all. He had previously received huge benefits peeking into the underground flow of energy; surely he couldn&rsquo;t return empty-handed now that the source of power was right in front of him.</span><br></p></div>
