        <h1>Chapter 5725: Everyone Must Die</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having made up his mind, Chu Feng turned to Qin </span><span>Changhong</span><span> and said, &ldquo;Qin </span><span>Changhong</span><span>, do you remember the words I told you? I could have killed you, but you aren&rsquo;t worthy. In fact, none of you are worthy.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Still talking tough, Chu Feng? Speak! Where&rsquo;s Xia Xingchen? If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll let your friends have a taste of the means of our Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s Enforcement Hall Master! You might have thick skin, but can you say the same about the others?&rdquo; Qin </span><span>Changhong</span><span> sneered as he conjured countless tools around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrible blood stench could be smelled even from a far distance away. Those were the tools he used for his torture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The juniors from the Totem Dragon Clan, with the exception of Long Chengyu and Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span>, revealed looks of fear. They were frightened by the notion of being subjected to such torture tools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hall Master Qin, Long Lin must be channeling his means to assimilate Chu Feng into his treasure. Don&rsquo;t kill him. Let Long Lin complete his formation. I want to see </span><span>what kind of treasure it is,&rdquo; the person standing at the forefront of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s elders said via voice transmission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was hoping to see if he could benefit through the treasure too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Rest assured, Lord Immortal Exalted. I just want to make Chu Feng spit out Xia </span><span>Xingcheng&rsquo;s</span><span> whereabouts before his death,&rdquo; Qin </span><span>Changhong</span><span> replied before pointing at the Totem Dragon Clansmen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh </span><span>shoosh</span><span> </span><span>shoosh</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The torture tools flew toward Long Chengyu and the other juniors. Qin </span><span>Changhong</span><span> was planning to torture them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the three Immortal </span><span>Exalteds</span><span> unleashed their formidable martial powers, with their attention focused on the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. They were unsure if the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was still able to exert his cultivation; if he could, they would flee right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, this was also an attempt to probe if the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief still posed a threat to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the torture tools approached Long Chengyu and the others, the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief glared at them with murderous intent, but he didn&rsquo;t make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the torture tools were about to slice into Long Chengyu and the others&rsquo; bodies&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tzzzzz</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A streak of lightning flashed across the sky, and the torture tools made out of treasures were instantaneously reduced to cinders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first thought that came to everyone&rsquo;s mind was that the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had made his move, but they quickly noticed that wasn&rsquo;t the case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their shock only deepened from this point onward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An incomparably powerful aura had appeared, but they were coming not from the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s experts but Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devastating lightning crackled around Chu Feng. It only covered a small area, but it caused the surroundings to shake, and space itself became distorted. The dragon&rsquo;s beard that had bound him shook intensely as if terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground beneath Chu Feng&rsquo;s feet instantaneously collapsed, and cracks swiftly spread outward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng and the others didn&rsquo;t fall into the collapsed ground; they were floating in mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those from the Totem Dragon Clan and the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect were taken aback. They could sense how terrifying the power imbued on Chu Feng was. Such power shouldn&rsquo;t have appeared in Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That fellow&hellip; Could he be&hellip; for real?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin </span><span>Changhong&rsquo;s</span><span> complexion turned awful, as he subconsciously took several steps back. It was only now that he realized that Chu Feng&rsquo;s claim of being able to take his life wasn&rsquo;t just a boast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng truly wielded the power to obliterate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Immortal Exalted,&rdquo; Qin </span><span>Changhong</span><span> said as he turned to the three Immortal </span><span>Exalteds</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did he know that the three Immortal </span><span>Exalteds</span><span> had no confidence in dealing with the situation either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the forbidden land, Long Lin was channeling his full power into the secret skill. His appearance had changed due to the heavy price he had to pay for invoking the secret skill. His previously middle-aged face had turned wrinkly, and his hair turned white like an old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn&rsquo;t have the spare attention to bother with the changes in his appearance, as he sensed that something had gone awry with the secret skill. There were signs that the secret skill to assimilate Chu Feng was being destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why would this happen?&rdquo; Long Lin couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had put his life on the line to channel the ancestral dragon&rsquo;s secret skill. The sheer power involved here should have sealed Chu Feng&rsquo;s fate; his death was already inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the secret skill couldn&rsquo;t bind Chu Feng at all. On the contrary, it was on the verge of being destroyed at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Lin couldn&rsquo;t imagine how great a power it would take to destroy the ancestral dragon&rsquo;s secret skill. This was a secret skill that the ancestral dragon had devoted all of his remaining power to right before its death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do. I can&rsquo;t fail here.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Lin glanced at Long Xue, as his eyes hardened with determination. He gritted his teeth and frenziedly channeled the formation. His face turned even older, as his white hair started to fall. His life force was being quickly sapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His efforts weren&rsquo;t in vain, as the dragon&rsquo;s beard became even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen were plunged into greater pain, but Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression remained the same as ever. The dragon&rsquo;s beard around him had become stronger too, but it couldn&rsquo;t bind Chu Feng at all, for he was harnessing a stronger power now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thirteen True God level cultivators from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect used their means to assess Chu Feng. They sensed a threat from him, but they couldn&rsquo;t believe that a Half-God level cultivator could actually endanger them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their first thought was that Chu Feng was putting on a strong front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person standing at the forefront of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s elders used his special observation means to assess the lightning imbuing Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, his face warped in horror, as he noticed the silhouette of a colossal lightning beast that spanned a size even larger than the </span><span>realm</span><span> they were in. That was a true cataclysmic existence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this cataclysmic existence was staring right at him, like a god looking down on an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Run&hellip;&rdquo; he sputtered with a hoarse voice as if someone had squeezed his guts out of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others could hardly hear what he was saying, as they asked, &ldquo;Lord Immortal </span><span>Exalted, what did you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;R-run&hellip; Run!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person standing at the forefront of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s elders suddenly turned around and fled. Unprecedented fear could be seen on his aged face, before he turned into a streak of light and escaped into the distance, leaving the others behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others from the Heavenly Dome Immortal stood frozen on the spot, but they quickly snapped out of their daze and escaped as well. The Immortal </span><span>Exalted&rsquo;s</span><span> reaction verified that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t just putting on a brave front before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other two Immortal </span><span>Exalteds</span><span> quickly escaped with the other elders, vanishing in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t bothered by their escape at all. He merely heaved a sigh and murmured, &ldquo;What a waste to use it on the likes of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lightning shone from Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes before the power of the lightning imbuing him abruptly shot out like a ferocious beast and devoured the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire realm shuddered in fear, as the devastating lightning tore through space, shattering the ground and obliterating everything in its path. Even the dragon&rsquo;s beard manifested by the ancestral dragon&rsquo;s secret skill was reduced to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All beings were equal before the lightning. Everything was mere fodder waiting to be destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thirteen True God level cultivators from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect had already escaped a far distance away, but it took only a mere instant for the lightning to catch up with them. The mere shockwave from the lightning put them into great pain, as their clothes, body, soul, and all of their treasures were instantaneously reduced to cinders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This feeling!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Lin, Taishi </span><span>Xingzhong</span><span>, and all of the experts in the realm stood up and stared at Chu Feng. They knew that it wasn&rsquo;t just a simple earthquake. All of them sensed a terrifying power with the ability to obliterate everything appearing in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Quick! Enter the teleportation formation!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of them rushed toward the teleportation formations, thinking they had to evacuate before the realm was destroyed. None of them had seen the lightning in person, and they didn&rsquo;t know what was going on either, but they sensed the threat of death looming above them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some took out their treasures, whereas others hid in their respective clan&rsquo;s forbidden land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone pulled out every means they had at their disposal in hopes of surviving this ordeal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the forbidden land, Long Lin also sensed the same threat of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Xue&rsquo;er</span><span>&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Long Xue and stopped channeling the secret skill, instead taking out a treasure. The treasure was a golden sphere with a thousand golden dragons coiling </span><span>around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grar</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Lin activated the treasure, and the golden sphere enlarged. The thousand golden dragons coiling around it surged out and formed an incredibly powerful barrier around him and Long Xue, protecting the two of them from harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Long Lin suddenly changed his hand seal, and the barrier comprising a thousand golden dragons started to contract till it was only small enough to protect Long Xue. Long Lin was left outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The contraction of the barrier strengthened its defensive prowess too, but Long Lin&rsquo;s eyes were still full of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Xue&rsquo;er</span><span>, you have to live on.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless cracks had appeared on the ground outside the ancestral dragon&rsquo;s forbidden land, as the earth collapsed in on itself. To be exact, the entire realm was collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people fled in a panic. Some people cried in agony. It was utter chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was still busy with their own business a moment ago, but they were now all united in a single endeavor&mdash;surviving this ordeal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, Lord Taishi </span><span>Xingzhong</span><span>!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many world spiritists approached Taishi </span><span>Xingzhong</span><span>, having sensed the cataclysmic aura and hoping to escape this place as soon as possible, but the latter wasn&rsquo;t moving at all. He stood on the spot, his eyes focused on the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea what was going on despite his powers, but his sharp senses told him that some kind of terrifying energy had appeared in this realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late,&rdquo; Taishi </span><span>Xingzhong</span><span> murmured as he closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was certain that the energy could destroy this realm and kill all of them. Escape was futile. They were all doomed to die today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the Immemorial Domain of Gods, a middle-aged man suddenly stalled to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, and his eyes turned so grim that it would strike fear in the hearts of any. He could sense what was going on too.</span></p></div>
