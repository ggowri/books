        <div>: He Won&rsquo;t Die In Vain<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Old Cat is a cunning one, and he has many formidable treasures on him. It&rsquo;s only normal that you aren&rsquo;t able to stop him,&rdquo; Chu Feng consoled.<br>He ushered the Asura World Spirit Army back into his World Spirit Space.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Yu Sha. It wasn&rsquo;t easy for us to bump into Old Cat, but he ended up getting away,&rdquo; Chu Feng apologized.<br>He did promise Yu Sha that he would save Xue Ji.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, please don&rsquo;t say that. That old cat is indeed a cunning one. You&rsquo;re not to be blamed for this. In any case, we finally have a lead to the young miss. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before we find him, capture him, and rescue the young miss,&rdquo; Yu Sha consoled.<br>She was not an unreasonable person. She could tell that Old Cat was beyond Chu Feng&rsquo;s current means to deal with, so she wouldn&rsquo;t blame Chu Feng for this.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, come in for a moment.&rdquo;<br>Yu Sha suddenly urged Chu Feng into his World Spirit Space. Chu Feng stepped in and saw Yu Sha staring at the gate that divided her from the rest of the Asura World Spirit Army. He quickly took a look as well and saw some changes in the image above the gate.<br>He had first discovered the image back when he was in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, but only a small portion of the image was visible back then. More than half of it was revealed now, and it seemed like they would soon be able to see the complete image.<br>Chu Feng was certain that there was some kind of secret hidden inside the image, but he couldn&rsquo;t figure out what it was. It was hard to analyze the image without seeing its complete form, though it should become easier once the complete image was finally revealed.<br>&ldquo;This feeling?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Elder Yuwei. Why didn&rsquo;t she wait for me? It can&rsquo;t be that she has gone after the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen?&rdquo; Chu Feng muttered worriedly.<br>He had left an imprint on Song Yuwei, and he could sense that she was currently moving at a fast speed. She had already promised to wait for him at an agreed location, so her movements indicated that something must have happened.<br>It was one thing if Song Yuwei was secretly tailing the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen, but it would be disastrous if she had been captured by them. After all, the concealment effect of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak would slowly fade with time, thus exposing her.<br>Chu Feng made a quick calculation, and it was indeed about time for the concealment effect to wear off. If Song Yuwei was too close to the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen, she might risk getting discovered. After all, they had many God-cloak World Spiritists with them.<br>To make things worse, Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s projection had teleported Chu Feng to a place that was relatively far away from Song Yuwei. Even if he started rushing now, it would take some time before he caught up with her.<br>So, he quickly borrowed the Asura King&rsquo;s power and bolted in the direction where Song Yuwei was moving toward.<br>In truth, Song Yuwei was indeed tailing the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen. She knew that Chu Feng had the ability to defeat them, making this an ideal opportunity for them to exact vengeance.<br>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t appear after the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen had been teleported out of the ancient remnant. She didn&rsquo;t know what was going on, but she was worried that they would lose sight of them. Thus, she decided to tail them.<br>She had waited far too long to avenge the young miss. She didn&rsquo;t want to miss this opportunity.<br>The good thing was that the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen were traveling at their fastest possible speed, so Song Yuwei was able to tail them without any problems.<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen came to a halt in front of a teleportation formation, but surprisingly, they didn&rsquo;t enter the teleportation formation right away. Seeing that, Song Yuwei did the same and stopped as well.<br>She was feeling worried because the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak&rsquo;s concealment effect that Chu Feng layered on her had dissipated. She could only rely on her own concealment means, but she wasn&rsquo;t confident of evading the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen&rsquo;s detection.<br>For that reason, she chose to keep a safe distance away from them.<br>All of a sudden, Situ Tingye turned around and looked in Song Yuwei&rsquo;s direction. Song Yuwei immediately realized that things had gone awry, especially when she saw the vile intent in Situ Tingye&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;This is bad.&rdquo;<br>Knowing that she had been discovered, Song Yuwei immediately turned tail and fled. However, horror filled her face the moment she turned her head around. She realized that Situ Tingye was standing right in front of her, blocking her path.<br>&ldquo;I was still wondering which rat has been tailing us, but it turns out to be the wretched remnant of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect,&rdquo; Situ Tingye said with a vicious grin as he grabbed Song Yuwei by her neck.<br>While Song Yuwei was a rank one Half-God level cultivator, she was completely powerless against Situ Tingye. Even struggling was beyond her, let alone escape.<br>&ldquo;Grand Elder, is she really from the Golden Dragon Flame Sect?&rdquo;<br>The others from the Situ World Spiritist Clan quickly crowded around.<br>It had been a long time since the Golden Dragon Flame Sect&rsquo;s fall from grace. For more than a thousand years, they hadn&rsquo;t seen any members of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect around. Thus, they couldn&rsquo;t help but be surprised when they learned that the person who had been tailing them was actually from the Golden Dragon Flame Sect.<br>&ldquo;Take a closer look. Do you really not recognize her? She&rsquo;s Song Luoyi&rsquo;s close aide!&rdquo; Situ Tingye said.<br>Everyone began assessing Song Yuwei&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;I remember it now! She&rsquo;s Song Luoyi&rsquo;s servant! She&rsquo;s still alive? Not to mention, she even managed to reach Half-God level!&rdquo;<br>At Situ Tingye&rsquo;s reminder, some of the elders quickly recognized Song Yuwei.<br>Song Luoyi was simply too famous back in that time period, and she was always together with Song Yuwei. It was no wonder some of the elders in the Situ World Spiritist Clan recognized her.<br>Back then, Song Yuwei thought that it was a good thing that Song Luoyi had made a name for herself, but it turned out to be a catastrophe instead.<br>&ldquo;Speak! How many rats are there left in the Golden Dragon Flame Sect?&rdquo; Situ Tingye questioned.<br>&ldquo;All of you from the Situ World Spirit Clan will die wretched deaths!&rdquo; Song Yuwei spat coldly.<br>How could she not harbor a deep hatred for the Situ World Spiritist Clan when they had destroyed the Golden Dragon Flame Sect? She would rather die than to submit to them.<br>&ldquo;You have a backbone. I just wonder if you&rsquo;re really as tough as you sound. I was still feeling frustrated about having lost the ancient remnant earlier. Heaven must have taken pity on me and sent me someone whom I can vent my rage on. Very well, keep those lips of yours sealed. We can slowly play this out.&rdquo;<br>Situ Tingye took out a box and opened it. The stench of blood immediately gushed out from within.<br>The box was filled with torture equipment, but what was frightening here were Situ Tingye&rsquo;s deranged eyes. However, Song Yuwei showed no fear at all. Instead, she burst into laughter.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind dying here. You&rsquo;ll be buried here with me anyway,&rdquo; Song Yuwei sneered.<br>It was not a brave front she was putting on here. She was confident that Chu Feng would exact vengeance for her and the Golden Dragon Flame Sect, especially after witnessing what he was capable of.<br></p></div>
