        <h1>Chapter 4237</h1>
        <div> - Who Did This?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Arrogant girl, you&rsquo;re asking to be punished.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Neither of you need to do anything. I&rsquo;ll take care of her.&rdquo;<br>Among Yue Yang&rsquo;s three world spirits was a female world spirit.<br>That female world spirit was also quite good-looking. But, when compared to Yu Sha, her appearance was much inferior.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that she wasn&rsquo;t attractive. It was simply that Yu Sha was too beautiful.<br>All creatures were like this. No one would want to be compared to another.<br>Women had a strong competitive nature to begin with. World spirits were no exception.<br>That female world spirit was someone with exceptionally strong talent. Not to mention in the martial cultivation realm, she was a proud woman even in the Asura Spirit World.<br>Earlier, Yu Sha had caused the crowd to exclaim in admiration at her appearance.<br>Yet, she had not received such treatment from them. As another world spirit from the Asura Spirit World, she was already displeased by this.<br>After hearing what Yu Sha said, it was only natural that she found it unbearable.<br>In such a situation, speaking with strength would be the best way to prove herself.<br>&ldquo;Very well. You can take care of this girl then.&rdquo;<br>The other two world spirits nodded. They had approved of the female world spirit&rsquo;s decision.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>In the next instant, Yu Sha moved. Like a phantom, she arrived before the female world spirit.<br>Her body twisted. Using her long and slender leg like a whip, she lashed out at the female world spirit.<br>Everything happened too quickly. Before the female world spirit could react to it, she had been struck by Yu Sha&rsquo;s attack.<br>&ldquo;Bang---&rdquo;<br>The whip kick struck her waist and sent her flying. The power of the kick was so strong that if it wasn&rsquo;t for a wall stopping her, she would&rsquo;ve been kicked even further away.<br>When she fell to the ground, her pelvis was completely shattered. Even her soul had been damaged by Yu Sha&rsquo;s attack. She was powerless to stand back up.<br>With a single attack, that female world spirit had lost the ability to continue fighting!<br>&ldquo;This!&rdquo;<br>It had happened too quickly. By the time the crowd reacted to what had happened, the female world spirit was already lying powerlessly in the corner with serious injuries.<br>Nevertheless, the crowd knew what must&rsquo;ve happened. It was most definitely Yu Sha who had seriously injured that female world spirit.<br>But, in terms of feeling the most shocked, excluding Yue Yang, it would be the other two world spirits.<br>After all, they had been standing beside that female world spirit. As such, they were able to sense the aura that Yu Sha emitted when she attacked the female world spirit.<br>Although Yu Sha was a rank one Utmost Exalted like them, the power of her earlier attack was most definitely not simply that of a rank one Utmost Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>Right when the crowd were still immersed in shock, Yu Sha kicked again.<br>She made successive kicks. Two whip kicks shot towards the two male world spirits.<br>Both world spirits were struck by her kicks. Like the female world spirit before them, they were also sent flying.<br>Merely, compared to when she had kicked the female world spirit, Yu Sha&rsquo;s attack was even more ruthless this time around. She had aimed her kicks at their faces.<br>Those two world spirits had cultivations of rank one Utmost Exalted. Neither of them were weak. Even their appearances were very handsome.<br>But, after being kicked by Yu Sha, those two male world spirits were mutilated beyond recognition. Half of their heads had caved in. Compared to the still conscious female world spirit, the two of them had already lost consciousness by the time they landed on the ground.<br>After making three successive attacks and defeating three world spirits that were also from the Asura Spirit World, Yu Sha turned her gaze to their master, Yue Yang.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; what are you trying to do?&rdquo;<br>Yue Yang turned green in the face after seeing Yu Sha&rsquo;s gaze. He immediately backed away.<br>He was afraid. He feared that Yu Sha would attack him.<br>He could sense that even though Yu Sha was a rank one Utmost Exalted, she possessed heaven-defying battle power. Furthermore, her heaven-defying battle power was extremely strong.<br>If Yu Sha decided to attack him, even he might not be a match for her.<br>But, Yu Sha didn&rsquo;t attack him. Instead, she asked, &ldquo;Are there any more?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Yue Yang was confused.<br>&ldquo;World spirits,&rdquo; said Yu Sha.<br>&ldquo;No&hellip; no more.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young lady, I concede.&rdquo;<br>Yue Yang reacted to Yu Sha&rsquo;s intention and immediately conceded.<br>As matters stood, he knew that he had been defeated, completely defeated. Not only were his world spirits no match for Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit, but even if he was to personally fight Yu Sha, he might not be a match for her.<br>Although he was extremely unwilling, he had to admit that he was far inferior to Chu Feng.<br>Although that was unimaginable, what Chu Feng had told him and Chen Guang that day might've been true.<br>At that moment, Yue Yang felt great regret. He regretted his decision to challenge Chu Feng. But, having already made his decision, there was nothing he could do apart from feeling regret.<br>Seeing that Yue Yang had conceded, Yu Sha turned around without saying anything and entered the world spirit gate.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for the losers to leave.&rdquo;<br>As Old Man Compliance said those words, he waved his arm again. In the next moment, Yue Yang and Chen Guang disappeared from the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>When they reappeared, they were outside the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>The people outside did not have too many expectations for the Ancient Compliance Castle. After the people of the younger generation entered, they had all turned their gazes toward the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>But, Chen Guang and Yue Yang&rsquo;s appearance had caught the crowd&rsquo;s attention.<br>After all, the two of them were well-known geniuses among the younger generations.<br>&ldquo;Why would Yue Yang and Chen Guang be out so soon?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with Chen Guang&rsquo;s injury?&rdquo; Someone voiced their surprise, and the others&rsquo; attention was immediately captured by that person&rsquo;s voice.<br>Once the crowd discovered that Chen Guang was seriously injured and Yue Yang&rsquo;s world spirits were even more seriously injured, they were very surprised.<br>All of a sudden, everyone was looking at Chen Guang and Yue Yang. Some of the more curious individuals even flew toward them from afar.<br>&ldquo;Disciple, what happened? Who injured the two of you?&rdquo;<br>Among the crowd, the most astonished were Chen Guang and Yue Yang&rsquo;s masters.<br>Their disciples had entered the Ancient Compliance Castle multiple times already. As such, they knew the Ancient Compliance Castle rather well.<br>Although one would have to breach spirit formations in order to obtain the treasure displayed by the Compliance Mirror, those spirit formations would not seriously injure people.<br>Because of that, Chen Guang and Yue Yang&rsquo;s masters believed that their disciples&rsquo; injuries had been caused by someone.<br>&ldquo;Master, this disciple was incompetent,&rdquo; Chen Guang and Yue Yang said those words to their masters at the same time.<br>&ldquo;Incompetent? Exactly what happened?&rdquo;<br>Not only were their masters curious, the bystanders also grew curious.<br>They all wanted to know exactly what had happened.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Hidden Gate inside the passageway to the Ancient Compliance Castle.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is something we never knew about.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But today, someone discovered that Hidden Gate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should one successfully pass through that Hidden Gate, they will receive additional rewards.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chen Guang and I were unconvinced by that person. Because of that, we ended up challenging him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should the challenge end in a failure, the consequence will be that we&rsquo;ll never be able to set foot into the Ancient Compliance Castle again.&rdquo;<br>Yue Yang and Chen Guang did not try to hide the truth, and began telling their masters what had happened in detail.<br>After hearing what had happened, the expressions of Yue Yang and Chen Guang&rsquo;s masters turned increasingly ugly.<br>It turned out that their disciples had challenged someone of their own accord, and had ended up being defeated.<br>This&hellip; was not glamorous at all.<br>After hearing about it, the crowd became very curious.<br>They were curious to find out who could possibly defeat both Yue Yang and Chen Guang.<br>&ldquo;Who defeated the two of you?&rdquo;<br>Before Yue Yang and Chen Guang&rsquo;s masters could even ask that question, some other curious people voiced the question first.<br>Turning toward the source of the voice, the expressions of the crowd all changed.<br>It was a young man. He stood in the sky nearby.<br>That young man was clad in a white gown and had a headdress on his head. His features were very handsome.<br>His eyes were especially spirited. It seemed like there were countless stars within them.<br>Furthermore, he was emitting the airs of pride.<br>He was someone that resembled an immortal at a glance, an expert who was untainted by the dust of the mundane world.<br>But, he was clearly very young.<br>Young and promising, those were the words that best described him.<br>Practically everyone present knew who he was.<br>After all, he was the proud disciple of the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.<br></p></div>
