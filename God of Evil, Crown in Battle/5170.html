        <h1>Chapter 5169</h1>
        <div>: Weird<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other disciples of the nameless sect hung their heads in shame, knowing that they had all acted cowardly.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor, I am Yue Ling. Thank you for saving my life. I have no way of repaying you, but I am willing to do anything for you,&rdquo; the beautiful woman suddenly kneeled on the floor and said.<br>&ldquo;Miss Yue Ling, you&rsquo;re a good person. None of your fellow sect members are worthy of you, so I&rsquo;d advise you not to choose a partner amongst any of them,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Yue Ling had been staring at Chu Feng as he said those words, but she suddenly felt energy flowing into her body. Then, Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance started changing before her eyes. He morphed from one form to another, and before she knew it, she had already forgotten what he really looked like.<br>Her mind was led into thinking that the altered appearance was Chu Feng&rsquo;s true face.<br>The same happened to everyone present.<br>This was the effect of Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation. He had killed those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan today, but he didn&rsquo;t want to be wanted by them yet. He didn&rsquo;t want to disguise himself unless he truly needed to.<br>With the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s influence, they could make it much harder for him to travel around the Totem Galaxy.<br>These people had witnessed him kill those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan today, but he wasn&rsquo;t so deranged as to murder all of them just to silence them. Thus, the best alternative was to simply alter their memories of him.<br>As long as these people couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint him out as the murderer who killed the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen, it wouldn&rsquo;t pose a problem to him. This was the prowess of his formation.<br>&hellip;<br>Following that, Chu Feng and City Lord Liang returned to Bitter Remembrance&rsquo;s place. With all of the ingredients gathered, Bitter Remembrance constructed another formation to treat Lord Yuwei.<br>The formation did improve Lord Yuwei&rsquo;s condition, but not by much. Regarding that, Bitter Remembrance said that he would try to look for another method to help Lord Yuwei.<br>Chu Feng wanted to contribute as well, but he was simply too weak to help with anything here. The only silver lining was that Lord Yuwei&rsquo;s condition was slowly improving.<br>For the time being, Chu Feng decided to head over to the place where Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s legacy was located. If he could acquire the legacy and advance his spirit power, he might just be able to do something for Lord Yuwei.<br>So, he quickly made his way toward Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s legacy.<br>It was located in a mountain range that was shockingly huge. Even with Chu Feng&rsquo;s current level of cultivation, he could only see a small portion of the mountain range when he scanned the surroundings with Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>The area was barren, and there were hardly any cultivators in the vicinity.<br>Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s legacy was definitely in this mountain range, but Chu Feng would have to figure out the exact location on his own. Not daring to get careless, he carefully scanned the area with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, but to no avail.<br>He tried resorting to the Heavenly Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk, but it refused to offer him any help.<br>As a result, he could only rely on himself.<br>He didn&rsquo;t know how well-hidden the legacy was, so he could only slowly scour the mountain. As such, his progress was slow. He had arrived in the morning, but before he knew it, the sun had already set.<br>By then, Chu Feng was already starting to feel a little flustered.<br>He was initially certain that he was in the right location, but his confidence was waning after searching half of the entire mountain range in futility. He was no longer sure whether he could obtain the legacy or not.<br>He didn&rsquo;t doubt the authenticity of Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s legacy&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t think that the old man had a reason to lie to him&mdash;but he wasn&rsquo;t sure if he was capable enough to find the legacy.<br>&ldquo;That is?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng suddenly spotted a speck of light in the distance. The presence of light suggested the presence of a cultivator. Thus, he quickly made his way toward the light, and a sect soon came into his line of sight.<br>Upon seeing the sect, his heart erupted in joy.<br>As the barren mountain range was poor in natural energies, he hadn&rsquo;t encountered a single cultivator or monstrous beast during his search. Yet, there was actually an entire sect here, not to mention that the sect was of a decent size.<br>Cultivators wouldn&rsquo;t select a barren land as their base. They must have their own considerations for choosing this location, and the chances were likely that they had discovered something in the vicinity.<br>It might just be related to Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s legacy.<br>Thus, he decided to first observe the sect.<br>He approached the sect and soon saw some of its disciples patrolling the area. At the sight of the disciples and the tokens they carried on their waists, his eyes narrowed ever so slightly.<br>&ldquo;What a coincidence!&rdquo;<br>The waist tokens carried by those disciples were empty too, and their robes were identical to nameless sect disciples he had encountered earlier.<br>Chu Feng took a look around the sect and noticed that there were no plaques indicating the sect name. Without a doubt, this was the sect where Yue Ling and the others were from.<br>Thus, he quickly concealed himself and infiltrated the sect, hoping to find Yue Ling and the others. His search soon paid off.<br>The group of disciples were inside a hall. With the exception of Yue Ling, the dashing male disciple and the others were kneeling on the floor, and their backs were covered in bloody lacerations.<br>Clearly, they were being punished for having left Yue Ling to the lurch.<br>There was also a white-haired elder in the room. There was a blood-covered whip placed on the tea table not too far away. He was probably the one who inflicted those injuries on the dashing young man and the other disciples.<br>&ldquo;Ling&rsquo;er, you may head to your room and rest up. Let these beasts continue kneeling here till they learn their lesson!&rdquo; the old man said.<br>&ldquo;Master, I wish to look for my benefactor,&rdquo; Yue Ling said.<br>&ldquo;Silly lass. That benefactor of yours dared to kill even the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen. He&rsquo;s a dangerous man. How can you look for him?&rdquo; the elder said.<br>&ldquo;But he saved my life. My life is his now. No matter what kind of person he is, I wish to look for him and repay the favor,&rdquo; Yue Ling said.<br>The elder let out a sigh. He then grabbed his whip once more and started lashing at the dashing young man and the other disciples. His strokes were much heavier this time around. By the end of his whipping, the disciples were lying on the floor, wailing in pain.<br>Their pitiful state did little to allay the elder&rsquo;s rage.<br>&ldquo;You bunch of useless things. You can&rsquo;t even protect your junior! What use do I have for the lot of you?&rdquo; the elder bellowed.<br>He then turned to Yue Ling and said, &ldquo;Ling&rsquo;er, what you&rsquo;re doing is no different from searching for a needle in a haystack. Why don&rsquo;t you draw out your benefactor, and I&rsquo;ll try to ask around for his whereabouts?&rdquo; the elder suggested.<br>Yue Ling immediately did as she was told and drew out a portrait using her spirit power.<br>&ldquo;Surely not?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart started beating nervously before Yue Ling could finish her painting. To his shock, Yue Ling was drawing out his real appearance.<br>He had clearly altered the memories of Yue Ling and the others. Even if Yue Ling tried to draw him, she should have drawn her altered impression of him.<br>There was something weird going on here.<br></p></div>
