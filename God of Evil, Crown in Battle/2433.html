        <div> - Scram Out Of My Body<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>The Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had unleashed his attack. Drawing help from the power of his two Ancestral Armaments, he shot forth a slash.<br>That slash was blue in color. It was formed by two intersecting slashes. It didn&rsquo;t shake space nor shatter the earth.<br>However, that slash was extremely powerful. That slash was a Taboo Martial Skill, an Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill.<br>This Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had unleashed an Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill from the very start. His intention was clear: he wanted to quickly kill Chu Feng so that Chu Feng could not cause further damage to their Kong Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng waved the Evil God Sword and shot forth a crimson slash, easily neutralizing the incoming blue slash sent forth by the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?!&rdquo;<br>Witnessing that scene, not to mention the others, even the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief revealed an expression of shock.<br>Although the slash he sent forth was not his strongest attack, it was still a very powerful attack.<br>Yet, it was so easily neutralized by Chu Feng.<br>Furthermore, he was shocked to discover that when his Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill collided with Chu Feng&rsquo;s crimson slash, it was absorbed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s crimson slash in addition to being neutralized by it.<br>That, was simply too frightening. It caused him to become subconsciously aware that he would be no match for Chu Feng, absolutely no match at all.<br>But, Chu Feng was merely a person of the younger generation, a mere Half Martial Ancestor. Thus, how could it be possible for him to not be a match for Chu Feng?<br>&ldquo;This guy, how could he possess such power?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, panic appeared on the previously malevolent face of the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>As one of the few most powerful existences in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, he rarely ever revealed such an expression.<br>Yet now, before Chu Feng, a person of the younger generation, he actually revealed such an expression.<br>The reason for that was because he realized that the person standing before him might not only be a person of the younger generation. In addition to that, it was very likely that Chu Feng was someone that he could not defeat.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that weapon! Exactly what is that weapon?!!!!&rdquo;<br>Soon, the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief realized the cause of it. He felt that it was very likely that the source was that crimson sword Chu Feng held in his hand.<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng unleashed his attack. Holding the Evil God Sword, he rapidly flew toward the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Abruptly, the Evil God Sword was rapidly thrust forth. Immediately, a sound akin to the wailing of ghosts and howling of wolves could be heard.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Several crimson sword rays filled the sky. Like a rainstorm, they moved to pierce the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Haaahhh!!!!&rdquo;<br>The Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief let out a loud shout. Then, an enormous ferocious beast appeared out of thin air, surrounding him.<br>It was the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s defensive Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill, the Ancestral Taboo: Guardian Beast.<br>Merely, compared to the Supreme Elder that Chu Feng had killed before, the Ancestral Taboo: Guardian Beast unleashed by the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was several times stronger.<br>&ldquo;Puu, puu, puu, puu, puu~~~&rdquo;<br>The very next moment, the crimson sword rays descended. Not only did the crimson sword rays easily penetrate the Ancestral Taboo: Guardian Beast, leaving it beyond recognition, many of the crimson sword rays even managed to pierce through the body of the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>The Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief actually suffered the same fate as the three Supreme Elders.<br>Although he was a rank two True Immortal, he was still powerless to resist Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the complexions of everyone from the Kong Heavenly Clan turned ashen.<br>The person in the sky was their Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s strongest expert.<br>Yet, even he was defeated by Chu Feng, and seriously injured on top of that.<br>It signified that no one in their Kong Heavenly Clan would be able to stop Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had a pale complexion. His body was covered with blood as he half kneeled midair after suffering very serious injuries.<br>Not to mention continuing to fight against Chu Feng, the current him did not even have the strength to stand up.<br>Merely, he was filled with irreconcilation. He looked at Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;You&hellip; exactly who are you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Am I not Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am someone who your Kong Heavenly Clan wanted to kill even though I possessed no hatred nor grievances with your Kong Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng said those words filled with mockery.<br>&ldquo;I am the one who made that decision. If you possess complaints in your heart, you can kill me. However, if it&rsquo;s possible&hellip; please spare our Kong Heavenly Clan.&rdquo; The Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng burst into loud laughter.<br>It was a very frantic and frightening laughter. It was as if that laughter was simply not a human&rsquo;s laughter at all. Hearing that laugh, one would feel extremely scared and tremble with fear.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I will kill you. However, before that, I will have you personally witness the destruction of your Kong Heavenly Clan by my hands.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, his lips were once again raised into a strange smile. Following that, he waved the Evil God Sword he held in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Sounds of the air being sliced through were accompanied by sounds akin to the wailing of ghosts and the howling of wolves.<br>This time around, the crimson sword rays were not aimed toward the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Instead, they once again descended upon the buildings of the Kong Heavenly Clan.<br>At that moment, screams and explosions sounded nonstop.<br>Seemingly as if this was not satisfactory, Chu Feng directly descended onto the ground and began to personally kill the people of the Kong Heavenly Clan.<br>All those that encountered Chu Feng, regardless of their cultivation, were all beheaded by Chu Feng with a single slash from his sword.<br>The speed of Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword was simply too fast, and the speed of Chu Feng&rsquo;s movements were also too fast. Even though he was only killing a single person with each slash of his sword, several thousands were killed by him in merely a split second.<br>Blood splattered everywhere. The Kong Heavenly Clansmen did not even have the time to scream before they were killed by Chu Feng.<br>Most importantly, the Kong Heavenly Clansmen were powerless to stop the situation.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was like a fierce tiger that was moving among a flock of sheep. To Chu Feng, the Kong Heavenly Clansmen were akin to sheep waiting for slaughter.<br>As such, he could kill them as much as he wanted!!!<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing that his own clansmen were dying by Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand nonstop, the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief actually started laughing.<br>Merely, it was a very tragic and pitiful laughter. It was the bitter laughter of powerlessness.<br>&ldquo;It seems that Grandmaster Prophet&rsquo;s prophecy was right.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Kong Heavenly Clan is indeed going to be destroyed by Chu Feng. Merely, never would I have thought that the reason why Chu Feng attacked our Kong Heavenly Clan is actually because of us. It is us who forced Chu Feng to eliminate us.&rdquo;<br>The Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief muttered as he laughed bitterly.<br>He knew that there was no one that could stop Chu Feng today, that their Kong Heavenly Clan was destined to be exterminated.<br>Merely, he was filled with regret. He regretted not listening to Kong Shunlian, and deciding instead to kill Chu Feng, someone who did not possess any hatred or grievance against their Kong Heavenly Clan, merely because of a prophecy.<br>It was because they wanted to eliminate Chu Feng that they ended up infuriating Chu Feng, causing him to attack their Kong Heavenly Clan.<br>It was all his mistake. Merely&hellip; it was already too late.<br>&ldquo;Ancestors, I, Kong Jitian, am a sinner. Because of my mistaken decisions, I have brought about the destruction of our Kong Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am unable to redeem myself, and can only apologize with my death,&rdquo; The Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief kneeled in midair with both his knees. Although he was extremely weak, he once again held up the two blades in his hands. However, the two blades were pointed toward himself.<br>This Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was actually planning to commit suicide.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng, who was openly slaughtering the people of the Kong Heavenly Clan, suddenly stopped.<br>The Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief also noticed the change. Thus, he looked over.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was still standing there. He had a murderous appearance on his face, and his hand was still holding onto the Evil God Sword.<br>The Evil God Sword in his hand was pointed at a person. As for that person, he was not someone powerful. He was merely a person of the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation, Kong Zheng.<br>At that moment, tears stained Kong Zheng&rsquo;s face. His body was trembling, and his complexion was pale. One could see his crumbled heart from his outward appearance.<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Kong Zheng kneeled onto the ground.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I beg of you, please stop!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you have decided to slaughter us. But, even if our Kong Heavenly Clan has let you down, please, please spare us this once.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, many of our Kong Heavenly Clansmen are innocent.&rdquo;<br>Kong Zheng was crying with incomparable suffering as he begged Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The very next moment, the sword Chu Feng held in his hand started to tremble violently.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s previously murderous expression started to become complicated. It was as if he wanted to kill Kong Zheng, but also didn&rsquo;t want to kill Kong Zheng.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng shouted furiously, &ldquo;Insolent fool! I am killing them for your own good, why are you stopping me?!&rdquo;<br>After that voice sounded, the earth started to violently rupture, and the sky started to tremble.<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the people of the Kong Heavenly Clan were all stunned. They all thought that Chu Feng was saying those words toward Kong Zheng.<br>However, Kong Zheng was also a member of the Kong Heavenly Clan. How could it be for Kong Zheng&rsquo;s good to kill the people of the Kong Heavenly Clan?<br>The moment when Chu Feng said his next sentence, the people of the Kong Heavenly Clan were all completely stunned.<br>&ldquo;I will not allow you to kill another person. Get the hell out of my body,&rdquo; Chu Feng said furiously.<br><br></p></div>
