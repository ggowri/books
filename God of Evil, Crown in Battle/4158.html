        <h1>Chapter 4157</h1>
        <div> - Nine Principles Dragon Sect<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The various powers were all trying their hardest to search for the Dragon Vein Source Stones.<br>At the very most, they&rsquo;d only search for other treasures in passing.<br>However, no one would go out of their way to especially search for other treasures.<br>However, there was one power that served as an exception. They were the Nine Principles Dragon Sect.<br>The Nine Principles Dragon Sect had come to the Endless Abyss in an alliance with other powers.<br>However, once they'd managed to breach the protective formation that surrounded the entrance, they had immediately abandoned their allies.<br>The people that had entered through that entrance were all people from their Nine Principles Dragon Sect, and the world spiritists they'd invited.<br>Although they&rsquo;d broken the rules, they had not been punished by the Dragon Clan. Instead, the Dragon Clan reacted as if they hadn&rsquo;t seen anything.<br>The reason for that was because the Nine Principles Dragon Sect had an excellent relationship with the Dragon Clan.<br>There had been rumors that there were people in the Dragon Clan backing the Nine Principles Dragon Sect. It was an open secret.<br>That was also the reason why no other power dared make an enemy of the Nine Principles Dragon Sect.<br>Who would dare go against a power that was backed by the Dragon Clan?<br>This time around, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect had invited a total of five Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists.<br>Furthermore, their Nine Principles Dragon Sect had two Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists themselves.<br>With that, there were a total of seven Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists working for the Nine Principles Dragon Sect.<br>Furthermore, the world spiritists that had been invited by the Nine Principles Dragon Sect were all extraordinary individuals.<br>This could be seen from the fact that the Nine Principles Dragon Sect had been the first to breach the protective formation and enter the Endless Abyss.<br>From this, one could tell how powerful those world spiritists were.<br>Logically, with such a powerful lineup of world spiritists, they should be putting forth an all-out effort to find the Dragon Vein Source Stones.<br>However, they hadn&rsquo;t done that and had instead formed a base camp that was overseen by the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>The remaining people left in four separate directions with treasure-seeking tools in hand.<br>Their goal was to find cultivation treasures like the Dragon Vein Blood Stones.<br>Currently, there was only an old man with sharp white brows in the camp. He sat cross-legged atop a palace.<br>His eyes were tightly closed, and his breathing followed a special rhythm. Even the surrounding natural energies were being transformed because of him.<br>Most importantly, there was an unending stream of gases gushing out from beneath the ground below him. Those gases would then ultimately enter his body.<br>Those gases were not only natural energies, they were also other special powers. The sounds of dragon roars could even be faintly heard from the gases.<br>It turned out that that place was a sacred cultivation ground.<br>It was no wonder then that the Nine Principles Dragon Sect had set up camp there.<br>In fact, even the palace itself was a special spirit formation meant to extract the cultivation gases from beneath the ground.<br>The person who was training with the cultivation gases at that moment was none other than the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster, a rank seven Utmost Exalted-level expert.<br>Suddenly, two figures flew over.<br>They were a middle-aged man and an old lady in a world spiritist cloak.<br>The middle-aged man was another son of the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>His age was relatively old. Whilst he had the looks of a middle-aged man, he was over five thousand years old.<br>The Nine Principles Dragon Sects Sectmaster had over a hundred children. Amongst them, he was most fond of his second son and his youngest son.<br>Because of how much he pampered them, he had even left two spots into the Endless Abyss to them.<br>His intention was so that they could use the opportunity to train and make breakthroughs in their cultivations.<br>The middle-aged man that flew over was the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster&rsquo;s second son.<br>His name was Long Shangjue. At over five thousand years old, he possessed the cultivation of rank three Utmost Exalted.<br>He was the person with the highest level of cultivation amongst the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster&rsquo;s numerous children.<br>&ldquo;Jue&rsquo;er, you&rsquo;ve returned. Seeing how happy you are, you must&rsquo;ve managed to harvest something. Come, let your father have a look at the treasure you discovered.&rdquo;<br>The Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster immediately opened his eyes upon detecting Long Shangjue&rsquo;s return. A smile also appeared on his face.<br>He knew his son Long Shangjue very well.<br>This second son of his was someone who would never do anything with uncertainty.<br>Since he had returned, it meant that he must&rsquo;ve obtained a harvest.<br>&ldquo;Father, please have a look.&rdquo;<br>Long Shangjue arrived before his father and brought forth an exquisite case.<br>The Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster accepted the case. Upon opening it, the look of joy on his face grew even stronger.<br>Inside the case was a single Dragon Vein Blood Stone.<br>&ldquo;Jue&rsquo;er, sure enough, you&rsquo;ve not disappointed father.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve managed to discover such a precious Dragon Vein Blood Stone so quickly,&rdquo; praised the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded from afar, &ldquo;Dragon Vein Blood Stone? That&rsquo;s extremely precious.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Second elder brother, you&rsquo;re truly amazing.&rdquo;<br>Looking towards the direction of the voice, two figures could be seen flying over.<br>Those two people were the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster&rsquo;s youngest son and the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Supreme Elder.<br>The name of the youngest son was Long Shangsong.<br>As for the Supreme Elder, his name was Long Pinggong.<br>They were the ones that had robbed Chu Feng of his Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone earlier.<br>Seeing the return of his youngest son, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster smiled so much that his wrinkles covered his face. He was even more joyous than when he saw his second son&rsquo;s return.<br>However, seeing the return of his little brother, Long Shangjue&rsquo;s expression turned ugly at once.<br>Long Shangjue and Long Shangsong were the two most beloved sons of the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>However, Long Shangjue&rsquo;s little brother Long Shangsong possessed talent that surpassed his own.<br>At present, both their clansmen and outsiders addressed his little brother Long Shangsong as the young sectmaster.<br>It was as if his little brother would definitely succeed his father as the next sectmaster.<br>On top of that, the two brothers had a bad relationship to begin with. That was also something that everyone knew.<br>As such, it was only natural for Long Shangjue to feel very displeased that he was now being suppressed by his little brother.<br>In fact, everyone could tell that Long Shangsong&rsquo;s words earlier, although seemingly praising his second brother, were actually a sneer at him.<br>Naturally, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster could tell this too.<br>But, not only did he not mind it, he instead turned to his youngest son and with a beaming smile on his face asked, &ldquo;Song&rsquo;er, could it be that you&rsquo;ve also managed to obtain a harvest?&rdquo;<br>Long Shangsong did not answer the question directly. Instead, he looked to the case his second brother had presented to his father.<br>&ldquo;Second brother, you&rsquo;ve returned to take credit for only a single Dragon Vein Blood Stone?&rdquo; Long Shangsong said to Long Shangjue.<br>If his earlier ridicules were still somewhat concealed, then his current ridicule was completely in the open.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Long Shangjue snorted coldly in anger. But, he didn&rsquo;t say anything.<br>He understood what sort of person his little brother was. Since he was making such cutting remarks, it meant that he must&rsquo;ve found a treasure even better than a Dragon Vein Blood Stone.<br>&ldquo;Song&rsquo;er, exactly what sort of treasure did you find? Quickly let father have a look,&rdquo; the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said with great anticipation.<br>&ldquo;Father, your child has prepared a surprise for you,&rdquo; immensely pleased with himself, Long Shangsong took out a case as he spoke.<br>Not only was the construction of the case exquisite, light was also circulating through it. That case was a treasure itself. It was countless times more exquisite of a case compared to the case that his second brother Long Shangjue had presented the Dragon Vein Blood Stone in.<br>Furthermore, that case was also emitting his father&rsquo;s favorite aroma.<br>Seeing the case, the smile on the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster's face grew even wider. He was grinning from ear to ear.<br>He accepted the case and opened it.<br>&ldquo;Bang!!&rdquo;<br>However, the moment he opened the case, a green gaseous substance sprayed out.<br>As the distance between him and the case was too close and he was also not on guard, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster had ended up with his entire face covered by the gaseous substance.<br>Once he was struck by the gaseous substance, his face immediately changed shape and he became incomparably ugly.<br>Poisonous gas. That was a poisonous gas.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the situation was bad, the Supreme Elder and the old lady immediately rushed forth to remove the poison the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was afflicted with.<br>As the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was a rank seven Utmost Exalted and had a very strong body, the prompt treatment soon relieved him of the poison.<br>However, the smile had completely disappeared from his face, and had been replaced with a look of anger.<br>&ldquo;Is this the surprise you mentioned?&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, he smashed the case at Long Shangsong.<br>The attack was not light at all. Not only was Long Shangsong sent flying, he also had his head bloodied by the case. His face had also deformed.<br>However, Long Shangsong was not concerned with his injuries at all. He hurriedly picked up the case to inspect it.<br>Upon doing so, he discovered that there was nothing in the case at all.<br>&ldquo;H-h-how c-c-could t-this be possible?!&rdquo;<br>Long Shangsong was in a complete panic. He was so shocked that he even began to stutter.<br></p></div>
