        <h1>Chapter 3116</h1>
        <div> - Murderous Gazes<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right when Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s Incomplete Immortal Armament was about to reach Chu Feng&rsquo;s neck, an explosion was suddenly heard. Following that, the Incomplete Immortal Armament in Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s hand was knocked flying. Even Tang Zhenghao himself was knocked back several steps.<br>His hand that he had held his Incomplete Immortal Armament with earlier was completely lacerated, and dripping with blood.<br>This sudden change caused everyone&rsquo;s expressions to turn sluggish.<br>&ldquo;This is a battle between people of the younger generation! To forcibly involve yourself in this battle, Chu Heavenly Clan, how shameless are you all?!&rdquo; Suddenly, Tang Zhenghao loudly cursed out in the direction of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>It was not only Tang Zhenghao who knew what had happened, everyone present knew that the current Chu Feng was no match for Tang Zhenghao.<br>Thus, the one to beat back Tang Zhenghao could not be Chu Feng. Instead, it must be an expert of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;While it&rsquo;s a spar, this is our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory. This old man will not permit you to bring harm to our Chu Heavenly Clansmen.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a figure walked out and stood beside Chu Feng. It was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Seeing the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, not to mention the others, even the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan were very surprised. They truly did not expect the person that helped Chu Feng out to be their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Precisely because it was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief that helped Chu Feng, it greater revealed how much he valued Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Humph, what a &lsquo;will not permit others from harming people of your clan.&rsquo; In the end, isn&rsquo;t it nothing more than bullying the young?&rdquo;<br>Tang Zhenghao felt extremely furious. He pointed to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and asked, &ldquo;If my Lord Clan Chief were standing here right now, would you dare to say those words?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if your clan&rsquo;s clan chief were standing here, this old man would still dare to say those words,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Very well, let us wait and see then,&rdquo; Tang Zhenghao spoke coldly. Then, he turned around and prepared to leave.<br>However, he suddenly stopped his footsteps. He turned around, looked to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, even if I failed to injure you today, it remains that I&rsquo;ve won.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whilst the Chu Heavenly Clan can protect you now, they cannot protect you forever. You&rsquo;d best be careful in the future. After all, I am not the only one in the Ancestral Martial Starfield that is stronger than you.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, a sneer appeared on Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s face.<br>It was a mocking smile, a ridiculing curve. Chu Feng firmly remembered that smile.<br>On that day, he was made a fool of. He was made a fool of by that Tang Zhenghao.<br>Although Chu Feng did not know how he managed to conceal his actual cultivation, he still concealed it, and Chu Feng was indeed careless.<br>As for the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, he did not say anything. Instead, he brought Chu Feng with him and returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>On the way back, the elder that had reported the matter suddenly kneeled in midair.<br>With his head lowered and his fist clasped, he spoke in a very apologetic manner, &ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, this subordinate was incompetent. I actually failed to detect that Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s actual cultivation. Lord Clan Chief, please punish me severely.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could you be blamed for this? Even this old man failed to detect that Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s actual cultivation was that of a rank eight Heavenly Immortal instead of a rank seven Heavenly Immortal.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This means that child possesses a treasure that was capable of concealing his cultivation from even this old man. It is that treasure that concealed his cultivation,&rdquo; After the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief finished saying those words, he looked to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, this old man made an error in judgement that caused you to be humiliated today. You must hate me for this, right?&rdquo;<br>Even though the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief told the elder that it was not his fault, he still had an extremely apologetic look to his eyes when he looked to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you cannot be blamed for this. It is I, Chu Feng, who was not strong enough.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, victory and defeat are common occurrences in battles. I, Chu Feng, have also not won every battle I&rsquo;ve been in. I have lost multiple times.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, losing is not frightening. What&rsquo;s frightening is being unable to win. However, I, Chu Feng, guarantee that I will win back my loss today,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well. That&rsquo;s more like a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drop the subject at that. We will not mention this matter again.&rdquo;<br>Seeing such an optimistic response from Chu Feng, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief immediately started to beam with happiness.<br>After returning to the Chu Heavenly Clan, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief gathered Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu, Chu Qing and Chu Shuangshuang.<br>Chu Feng already knew Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu and Chu Qing. However, it was his first time meeting Chu Shuangshuang.<br>Chu Shuangshuang was a bit older than Chu Feng and the others. She was soon to be three hundred years old.<br>However, her appearance was very youthful. From a glance, she was simply a young woman. Furthermore, although her appearance could not be said to be extremely beautiful, she gave off a very impressive air.<br>She was the sort of woman that one would have a favorable impression of right away.<br>The four of them seemed to already know that they would be entering the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm with Chu Feng. Thus, they did not reveal any surprise on their faces after seeing Chu Feng.<br>When Chu Qing saw Chu Feng, he immediately took the initiative to greet him. While it was the first time Chu Shuangshuang had seen Chu feng, she was still very cordial with him as well.<br>Only Chu Huanyu and Chu Haoyan were still looking at Chu Feng with intense hatred in their eyes. This was especially true for Chu Haoyan. He was looking at Chu feng with a gaze filled with even greater hatred than Chu Huanyu.<br>His reaction was understandable. After all, his grandfather was imprisoned because of Chu Feng. And now, his grandfather was enduring the torture of the Law Enforcement Hall every day.<br>&ldquo;Haoyan, Huanyu, Chu Feng is your brother. How could the two of you look at him in such a manner?&rdquo;<br>A voice was suddenly heard. It was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Hearing what the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu both retrieved their hatred-filled gazes.<br>However, they still had disapproving expressions.<br>&ldquo;Kneel!&rdquo; Suddenly, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief shouted angrily.<br>His shout caused the entire palace hall to tremble violently. A bone-chilling sensation enveloped Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu.<br>How could Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu dare to hesitate? Immediately, the two of them kneeled on the ground and did not dare to even lift their heads.<br></p></div>
