        <div> - Chu Feng Entering The Battle<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this guy trying to do? Is there something wrong with his head?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why did he decide to throw a medicinal pellet at Nangong Yifan?&rdquo;<br>The All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations began to look at Chu Feng as if he was a madman.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s current behavior was simply too strange. Even at that moment, they were unable to understand exactly what he was trying to accomplish.<br>&ldquo;What a waste, that was for you to treat your injuries,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;Treat my injuries? Why do I need to treat my injuries when I&rsquo;m not injured?&rdquo; Nangong Yifan asked coldly. There was even a trace of mockery in his tone.<br>&ldquo;That so-called Scarletflame Soularmor of yours has brought quite a backlash on you. It&rsquo;s better that you recuperate so that you won&rsquo;t say that I am bullying you when you&rsquo;re injured,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What are you trying to imply?&rdquo; Nangong Yifan asked coldly.<br>&ldquo;This matter is caused by me. Thus, I should be the one to settle it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Nangong Yifan, didn&rsquo;t you want to fight me? I, Chu Feng, am officially accepting your challenge,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What? He accepted the challenge?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly what&rsquo;s wrong with this guy&rsquo;s head?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Earlier, he didn&rsquo;t dare to even utter a fart when he was humiliated. His behavior was simply that of an utter coward. He even needed Wuming Yuanzhi and the others to come to his assistance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why would he suddenly decide to accept the challenge now?&rdquo;<br>Looks of shock filled the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generation&rsquo;s faces. They were unable to comprehend Chu Feng&rsquo;s behavior.<br>Even Nangong Yifan himself felt surprised. He asked, &ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course. If you&rsquo;re ready, I&rsquo;ll begin my attack,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Nangong Yifan burst into sudden laughter. He said, &ldquo;Very well, go ahead and release that world spirit of yours.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why do I need to release my world spirit?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you trash in terms of martial cultivation? Wasn&rsquo;t it your world spirit techniques and world spirit that you rely on?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I do not wish to waste time. Since you plan to fight me, go ahead and unleash your full strength, since I'm not going to go easy on you,&rdquo; said Nangong Yifan.<br>Nangong Yifan had not only heard about Chu Feng from the others&rsquo; discussions. He had also made inquiries into Chu Feng himself.<br>Thus, he knew that he had relied not on his cultivation, but rather his world spirit&rsquo;s strength in order to tie with Linghu Hongfei.<br>&ldquo;Oh. Indeed, I fought against Linghu Hongfei using my world spirit techniques.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I don&rsquo;t need to use my world spirit to take care of you. I myself will suffice,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What are you implying?&rdquo; Nangong Yifan narrowed his brows and asked coldly.<br>&ldquo;Am I not clear enough?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll make myself more clear. Compared to Linghu Hongfei, I feel that&hellip; you are still not qualified to fight my world spirit. I, Chu Feng, am able to take care of you myself.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng spoke with ease and confidence. However, his words were extremely mocking.<br>Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, the proud Nangong Yifan was unable to tolerate him.<br>It had always been him who insulted others. Never had he ever been insulted by another.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Nangong Yifan flipped his wrist and stuck his halberd into the ground.<br>The power of his motion was so strong that an enormous crack was left in the ground.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you asked for this yourself! Don't blame me for bullying you!&rdquo;<br>After shouting those words, Nangong Yifan took a step forward. He turned into a flash of light as he flew toward Chu Feng.<br>His attack was the same as Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s initial attack toward him. He did not use any martial skills. Instead, he was using his physical body to attack Chu Feng. He shot a punch directly at Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>As for Chu Feng, he stood there motionless. Like a target, he waited for Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s fist to reach his face.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>Finally, Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s fist arrived before Chu Feng. Explosively, it smashed into Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>Due to the fact that the speed of that punch was simply too fast, it was almost certain to hit.<br>However, when the crowd saw the scene before them, their expressions changed enormously.<br>They were astonished to discover that Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s fist was less than half a foot away from Chu Feng&rsquo;s face. Yet, at such a distance, his fist was stopped.<br>It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng had caught Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s punch with his hand.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Look!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Look at that guy&rsquo;s body!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, look at his forehead!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that that guy has trained in the legendary Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, and has also managed to unseal the power of the Lightning Armor?!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the people of the younger generation present burst into a complete uproar.<br>Even those from the All-heaven Starfield were unable to contain their astonishment.<br>Although Nangong Yifan was unable to use the treasure that increased his cultivation, his Divine Power and All-heaven Buddha Body were still active.<br>With those two powers activated, Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s cultivation had increased to rank four Exalted.<br>Logically, Chu Feng would also have to increase his cultivation in order to block Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s punch.<br>Thus, Chu Feng did not try to hold back, and activated both his Divine level Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor.<br>Logically, as Chu Feng&rsquo;s actual cultivation was that of a rank three Exalted, he would be able to increase his cultivation to rank five Exalted with the use of those two powers.<br>However, because Nangong Yifan had fought with Wuming Yuanzhi and the others earlier and was unable to use his Scarletflame Soularmor, and thus could only increase his cultivation to rank four Exalted, Chu Feng decided not to take advantage of Nangong Yifan and deliberately suppressed a level of cultivation.<br>At that moment, the crowd felt that his actual cultivation was that of a rank two Exalted. They believed that he had increased his cultivation to rank four Exalted with the use of his Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor.<br>As Chu Feng was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, even Lord Shoujian might not be capable of detecting that he had suppressed his cultivation. As for those people of the younger generation, it would simply be impossible for them to detect it.<br>Thus, they simply had no idea Chu Feng&rsquo;s actual cultivation was that of a rank three Exalted.<br>They felt that his actual cultivation was rank two Exalted, like Nangong Yifan, Wuming Yuanzhi and the others.<br>That said, they were still astonished by Chu Feng.<br>Divine level Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor.<br>They had all heard of those abilities before.<br>However, what they&rsquo;d heard were merely rumors. Even though they were experienced and knowledgeable geniuses, it was their first time witnessing a person of the younger generation capable of using those two abilities.<br>Thus, merely those two abilities were sufficient to prove that Chu Feng was extraordinary.<br>Everyone knew that he was not an ordinary martial cultivator.<br>Instead, he was an existence that had trained his Heavenly Bloodline to its peak.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that you actually possess some skills,&rdquo; even the gaze with which Nangong Yifan looked to Chu Feng had changed somewhat.<br>He had acknowledged Chu Feng&rsquo;s Divine level Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor more than Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s Divine Power and bloodline power.<br>&ldquo;I am naturally capable. It&rsquo;s you who is somewhat disappointing,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s face immediately turned gloomy upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m saying is that this fist of yours is completely powerless,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Bastard, you&rsquo;re courting death!&rdquo; Nangong Yifan grew furious. He sent forth his other fist explosively at Chu Feng.<br>The strength of that fist was clearly much stronger than the first. Even if Nangong Yifan didn&rsquo;t go all-out in the attack, he was not holding back.<br>Chu Feng let out a cold smile at the furious Nangong Yifan. He made a fist with his other hand and shot it toward Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s incoming punch.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>The two fists collided. Energy ripples swept all over.<br>Chu Feng was knocked back ten steps before he managed to stabilize himself.<br>Although Chu Feng was forced back ten steps by the confrontation of fists, the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations all had extremely serious looks on their faces. There was no trace of a smile on their faces at all.<br>The reason for that was because they were able to clearly see that Nangong Yifan, the man who was renowned for his battle power, was actually knocked back twenty steps by the confrontation of fists before barely being able to stabilize himself!!!<br>Furthermore, his current appearance looked rather piteous.<br></p></div>
