        <h1>Chapter 1363</h1>
        <div> - Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Senior Ma, you can stop pretending to be modest. We all know that your Sealing Ancient Village&rsquo;s village protection treasure is the Sealing Glacier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Sealing Glacial Water is merely formed by the cold air emitted by the Sealing Glacier. After all these years where the cold air has been emitting day and night, you all would have as much Sealing Glacial Water as you wanted by now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, we are merely asking for a trifling amount of a hundred thousand drops. If you do not wish to present us with it, you can tell us that. However, there is no need for you to try to beat around the bush with us by bringing out your Sealing Ancient Village&rsquo;s ancestor and seniors,&rdquo; Huang Feng spoke with an expression of disbelief.<br>&ldquo;It is true that the Sealing Glacial Water is formed by the cold air emitted by the Sealing Glacier. Furthermore, it is also true that they are being formed day and night.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, our Sealing Ancient Village does not have a custom of saving Sealing Glacial Water. Ever since the day our Sealing Ancient Village was established, we have been sharing the Sealing Glacial Water with everyone from the Alliance Domain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I believe your World Spiritist Alliance knows about this matter better than anyone. That&rsquo;s because, regardless of how much Sealing Glacial Water we have shared with the others, your World Spiritist Alliance is most definitely the party that has benefitted the most,&rdquo; Old Village Chief Ma said.<br>&ldquo;Sigh. Senior Ma, you are truly being stingy. We juniors merely need some Sealing Glacial Water. Is there a need for you to bring up bombastic talk?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about this, since you are so stingy, we will make sure that you will not be losing out.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make the matter fairer and have a contest of world spirit techniques. I will use this as my gambling stake. Senior, what do you think?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the Cosmos Sack on Huang Feng&rsquo;s waist started to shine with light. Soon, a cyan ruyi scepter appeared in his hand.<br>This ruyi scepter had a very ordinary appearance. It was neither large nor small. However, it was very pretty.<br>Cyan-colored glimmering scales covered its surface. Those scales appeared as if they were wiggling. It was as if they were alive.<br>At this time, Wang Qiang was unable to contain himself and blurted out, &ldquo;Dang, th, that is mo, most definitely a ve, very valuable treasure,&rdquo;<br>As for Chu Feng, his eyes also shone upon seeing the ruyi scepter. He was able to tell that this ruyi scepter was most definitely a treasure that contained a very powerful and special natural energy.<br>That sort of energy did not resemble the energy from weapons. Instead, the energy was a sort of energy capable of affecting world spirit techniques.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell that this treasure was definitely very helpful to a world spiritist&rsquo;s spirit formations.<br>In other words, if someone were to set up a spirit formation with all their strength, the spirit formation that they set up would range between an inferior-quality spirit formation and a superior-quality spirit formation.<br>However, if one was to utilize the energy within this ruyi scepter when creating that spirit formation, the strength of the spirit formation would increase, and it would become a superior-quality spirit formation.<br>That was the effect, the greatness, of that ruyi scepter. To world spiritists, that ruyi scepter was a very valuable treasure bestowed by the heavens themselves. To call it the world spiritist&rsquo;s Imperial Armament would not be excessive.<br>That was because powerful world spiritists were capable of using it to strengthen their killing spirit formations, allowing them to display previously-unimagined might.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Lord Village Chief&rsquo;s Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter!&rdquo; Compared to Chu Feng and the others, when the villagers of the Sealing Ancient Village saw this ruyi scepter, they were all very stirred up emotionally.<br>Even the gaze of Old Village Chief Ma, who had been calm and collected, started to flicker. A change in mood had occurred on his face.<br>From the discussion of the surrounding crowd, Chu Feng came to know that this ruyi scepter was called the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter.<br>It was something that Old Village Chief Ma had obtained by coincidence in the past.<br>However, it was precisely for the sake of obtaining this ruyi scepter that Old Village Chief Ma had ended up suffering heavy injuries and unrecoverable internal injuries.<br>Originally, Old Village Chief Ma had possessed exceptionally powerful world spirit techniques. In the past, he had defeated the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s management world spiritists multiple times.<br>He had been publicly renowned as the genius with the strongest talent in world spirit techniques in the history of the entire Sealing Ancient Village. He was known to have been the person who possessed the chance to surpass their Sealing Ancient Village&rsquo;s ancestor, the great world spiritist who might be capable of leading the Sealing Ancient Village to surpass the World Spiritist Alliance.<br>But, all because of that one time where he was seriously injured, Old Village Chief Ma&rsquo;s world spiritist techniques started to stagnate. That injury left behind an effect for the rest of his life.<br>Thus, to Old Village Chief Ma, this Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter was something that he both loved and hated.<br>He loved it because it was a most precious, priceless treasure that countless world spiritists coveted.<br>He hated it because it had ruined his future in world spirit techniques. For the rest of his entire life, he was only able to remain at his current level, unable to progress at all.<br>However, everyone knew that regardless of how much Old Village Chief Ma hated the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter, the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter remained an item that he relied upon.<br>It was only because of the existence of the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter that he felt that even if it had ruined his future, he had not lost out too badly, because he managed to obtain this most precious treasure.<br>However, many years ago, the grandfather of Huang Feng, Huang Ping, Huang Lang and Huang Jing, Huang Xiuji, arrived at the Sealing Ancient Village. He challenged Old Village Chief Ma in a contest of world spirit techniques.<br>This Huang Xiuji was someone who had competed with Old Village Chief Ma many a time in the past. However, every single time, he would leave in crushing defeat. Thus, Old Village Chief Ma did not consider him to be a threat at all and accepted the challenge.<br>However, Old Village Chief Ma&rsquo;s world spirit techniques had been stagnant the entire time, unable to make the slightest bit of headway, whereas Huang Xiuji had been making constant progress over the years.<br>Thus, Old Village Chief Ma, this previously undefeated general, was finally defeated by Huang Xiuji. Furthermore, it was a crushing defeat.<br>As victory and defeat were commonplace in contests and wars, it should not be considered much for Old Village Chief Ma to be defeated by Wang Xiuji.<br>However, every single time they competed in world spirit techniques, they would always take out items as gambling stakes. At that time, the time that Old Village Chief Ma had lost, he had taken out the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter, the item that had ruined his future, that most precious treasure, as his gambling stake.<br>&ldquo;As expected, it appears that everyone has a very deep impression of this. Who would&rsquo;ve expected that you all would still remember it after all these years. That&rsquo;s right, this is senior Ma&rsquo;s late Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter. Unfortunately, its current master is no longer senior Ma, and is instead our grandfather,&rdquo; Huang Feng spoke with a beaming smile.<br>Hearing those words, the people from the Sealing Ancient Village started to gnash their teeth in anger and tremble with rage. They all knew very well that if it weren&rsquo;t for their Old Village Chief Ma being seriously injured, if it weren&rsquo;t for Huang Xiuji taking advantage of his injuries, it would have simply been impossible for Huang Xiuji to win.<br>Yet, this Huang Feng actually said these sorts of words to them. He was simply too unreasonable, too inhumane.<br>&ldquo;Senior Ma, I&rsquo;ve heard that you were very unwilling to accept your defeat after having lost this Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter to our grandfather back then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, junior shall present to you an opportunity to seize back this Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter. You can pick any four of your Sealing Ancient Village&rsquo;s younger generation to compete against us four siblings.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as they can win against us, we shall return this Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter to you. What do you think about this?&rdquo; Huang Feng said with a smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s actually planning to challenge us with the Cyan Qilin Ruyi Scepter?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truly arrogant and conceited. While it is true that their grandfather&rsquo;s world spirit techniques are very powerful, yet they, at their young little age, actually dare to act this arrogant. Do they really think that there is no one in our Sealing Ancient Village capable of standing up to them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Village Chief, allow the Zhou Long, Zhou Hu and Zhou Feng siblings to take care of them. There&rsquo;s no need for four people. With merely the three of them, they would be able to win against the four of them and leave them utterly defeated,&rdquo; Hearing those words, the Sealing Ancient Village&rsquo;s villagers burst into an uproar. One by one, they requested for the Old Village Chief Ma to send forth the three Zhou siblings.<br>Ever since Huang Xiuji had defeated Old Village Chief Ma, the management world spiritists from the World Spirit Alliance who been defeated by Old Village Chief Ma in the past began to arrive one after the other to challenge Old Village Chief Ma.<br>Without exception, they all defeated Old Village Chief Ma. At that moment, the honor that the Sealing Ancient Village&rsquo;s Old Village Chief Ma had established throughout his life was trampled until nothing remained.<br>This matter caused the people from the Sealing Ancient Village to feel extremely unreconciled. Thus, although they appeared to be fearful of the World Spiritist Alliance, they were actually both hateful and fearful of the World Spiritist Alliance. In fact, their hatred was even greater than their fear. That was because ever since Old Village Chief Ma&rsquo;s world spirit techniques started to stagnate, the people from the World Spiritist Alliance completely and miserably exploited the Sealing Ancient Village.<br>And now, there were actually people from the younger generation who dared to challenge them. As the three Zhou siblings were genius world spiritists, the people from the Sealing Ancient Village did not believe that they would lose.<br>At this time, all of them wanted to use this opportunity to recover some lost ground from the World Spiritist Alliance, taking them down from their high horse.<br></p></div>
