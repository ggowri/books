        <div> - High Hopes<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Wait, one move?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that in the match back then, Chu Xuanyuan, who was not even thirty years old, defeated your master with only one move?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the plain-clothed old monk also revealed a surprised expression. In fact, he even started to tremble slightly, and goosebumps appeared on his body.<br>It was not that he was afraid. Rather, he was incomparably shocked from how unimaginable that was.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; The Golden Crane True Immortal said with a sigh.<br>At that moment, his state was very strange. It was as if he had returned to the scene back then, and was once again witnessing that battle.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible. No matter how powerful Chu Xuanyuan might be, it should still be impossible for him to defeat your master with only one move.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, your master was the strongest Palace Master to have ever appeared in the Dao Imperial Palace. Even though we have trained for so long, neither one of us are able to reach his level. In fact, we are people that will not be able to reach his level in our entire life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could Chu Xuanyuan defeat him with only&hellip;?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Only one move. I personally witnessed it. There is no mistake,&rdquo; The Golden Crane True Immortal said sternly.<br>&ldquo;Back then, Chu Xuanyuan was not even thirty years old. Yet, he defeated my renowned master with only a single move.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, the strength he had back then was equal to that of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Later on&hellip; he was most likely unparalleled in the entire Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, why would he be killed by his clansmen? I feel that it was most definitely a voluntarily suicide. Otherwise, if he were to resist, who could possibly kill him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I detest him because of his extreme arrogance and his demeanor of a ruler when facing others.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But&hellip; when facing his own clansmen, he became a coward, and even willingly renounced his life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Originally, I respected him. However, after he died, I now look down on him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is precisely because I personally saw how powerful he was that I placed high hopes on him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In fact, I even thought that he was capable of leading the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm to become the ruler of our Starfield, and then leading our Starfield to conquer the vast starry sky.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet he&hellip; was ruined by his own clansmen. Just like that, he died in vain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I detest him not because he defeated my master and caused him to die of depression.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead, it is because I had placed that much hope on him. Yet he&hellip; decided to forfeit his life just like that.&rdquo;<br>As the Golden Crane True Immortal said those words, he tightly clenched his aged fists. However, there was not the slightest trace of anger in his eyes. Instead, they were filled with sadness.<br>It was as if this was something that he felt very unreconciled toward, that was the regret of his life, a knot that he would never be able to undo in his heart.<br>The plain-clothed old monk walked over to the Golden Crane True Immortal and softly patted his shoulder. He said, &ldquo;As your old friend of many years, how could I not understand you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All these years, you will get angry every time Chu Xuanyuan is mentioned.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Others felt that you bore grudges against Chu Xuanyuan because your master was defeated by him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I have always felt that it was because of something else that you wished to keep hidden. Merely, I never expected that it would actually be because you placed so great a hope on Chu Xuanyuan only to have it turn into deep disappointment.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, Golden Crane, all these years, have any of us managed to see Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s corpse?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While rumor has it that he was killed by the Chu Heavenly Clan after being imprisoned by them, is he truly dead? Would the Chu Heavenly Clan really be willing to kill someone like Chu Xuanyuan? Would they really be able to kill him?&rdquo;<br>The plain-clothed old monk used that questioning gaze to look at the Golden Crane True Immortal. However, his questions didn&rsquo;t seem to only serve to question the Golden Crane True Immortal. Instead, it seemed like he was asking himself the same question too.<br>&ldquo;Old Demonic Substance, forget about it. You shouldn&rsquo;t bother to have high hopes. We all know very well what sort of people the Chu Heavenly Clan are. They are a clan of cold-blooded individuals who do not care about sentiments and feelings. Moreover, Chu Xuanyuan killed so many people, and indeed made an enormous mistake.&rdquo; [1. Old Demonic Substance used to be Old Poisonous Substance. Not sure why Bee changed the name.]<br>&ldquo;Rather than placing hopes on Chu Xuanyuan being alive, it is better to place our hopes on this Li Ming and Chu Feng. Perhaps one day, one of them might become the second Chu Xuanyuan,&rdquo; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;Speaking of that Chu Feng, he is truly mysterious. He possesses a Heavenly Bloodline, and trains in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. Yet, no one knows where he&rsquo;s from.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come to think of it, I remember that Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son also seemed to be named Chu Feng, no?&rdquo; The plain-clothed old monk said.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; The Golden Crane True Immortal&rsquo;s expression changed. He turned to the plain-clothed old monk and asked, &ldquo;Could it be that you feel Chu Feng might be him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;ve never suspected that to be the case,&rdquo; The plain-clothed old monk said.<br>&ldquo;There are countless individuals in this world with the same name and surname,&rdquo; The Golden Crane True Immortal shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, there are a lot of people surnamed Chu in this world. As for people by the name of Chu Feng, there are quite a few of them too. However, there is only a single Chu family that possesses a Heavenly Bloodline.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, that Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique is not something that everyone possesses, nor is it something that anyone could learn.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only does he possess such outstanding talent, his name is also exactly the same. No matter how many people with the same name and surname there are in this world, how many such coincidences could there be?&rdquo; The plain-clothed old monk asked.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying all this just so that you can tell me that Chu Feng is Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, do not forget why Chu Xuanyuan decided to unleash a massacre back then. Wasn&rsquo;t it because his son was humiliated by others after it was made clear that he did not possess a Heavenly Bloodline?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;One was trash that did not possess a Heavenly Bloodline, whereas the other is a genius who trains in the Divine Punishment Mysterious technique, how could they possibly be the same person?&rdquo; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;Perhaps he has changed over the years. After all, geniuses can come to a premature end, and trash can rise to power,&rdquo; The plain-clothed old monk said.<br>&ldquo;Old Demonic Substance, I know that you think very highly of Chu Xuanyuan. Like me, you also experienced his strength. That is why you&rsquo;ve also placed high hopes on him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But&hellip; I can tell you with certainty, that even if Chu Feng is Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, that does not mean that Chu Xuanyuan is still alive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should stop having that sort of fantasy. Furthermore, even if Chu Xuanyuan really is still alive, so what? He is neither a friend nor a relative of ours. To him, we are nothing more than transient guests. Perhaps he might have already forgotten who we are.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if he is still alive, even if he could once again emerge in power, what does that have to do with us? Could he possibly provide us with benefits?&rdquo; The Golden Crane True Immortal asked.<br>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t what you said earlier,&rdquo; The plain-clothed old monk said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;What I said earlier was what I felt back then. Right now, my opinions have changed. I need to find a promising genius. I need to make that genius related to me. Like that, once he matures in the future, I will be able to obtain benefits.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for this Li Ming, he is my hope,&rdquo; As the Golden Crane True Immortal said those words, he looked to Young Master Li Ming again.<br>The plain-clothed old monk also looked over.<br>&ldquo;This brat.&rdquo;<br>Upon looking, those two grand individuals both revealed stunned expressions. They were shocked.<br>At that moment, Li Ming was sitting cross-legged on the floor. He was completely condensing the golden radiance on his body inside his body. He was stabilizing the power given to him by the golden radiance.<br>As for the Profound Light Pillar, it was still floating behind him. Merely, the size of that Profound Light Pillar had shrunk to only one centimeter in length.<br>&ldquo;This brat&rsquo;s potential is truly astonishing. Even in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, very few people will be able to contend against him. Golden Crane, you have truly managed to pick up a treasure,&rdquo; The plain-clothed old monk said.<br>&ldquo;Of course. My vision is absolutely correct,&rdquo; The Golden Crane True Immortal was immensely pleased with himself.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Young Master Li Ming opened his eyes. He had managed to completely grasp the power he had obtained from the Profound Light Pillar.<br>At that moment, he stood up and cast his gaze toward Chu Feng. With a very arrogant tone, he said, &ldquo;Are you still planning to contend against me now?&rdquo;<br><br></p></div>
