        <h1>Chapter 3646</h1>
        <div> - True Strength<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Nangong Yifan suddenly raised his hand to indicate to the crowd to quiet down.<br>Among the people of the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generation, Nangong Yifan possessed absolute power. Thus, after he made such a gesture, the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations all shut their mouths.<br>Surprisingly, after indicating for the people behind him to quiet down, Nangong Yifan, who barely spoke, suddenly spoke again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve long known that, apart from Linghu Hongfei, the rest of the Ancestral Martial Starfield is fully composed of trash.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, I have always felt it to be beneath me to fight you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After today&rsquo;s experience, that is indeed the case,&rdquo; Nangong Yifan mocked.<br>Hearing those words, Kong Ci and the others all revealed displeased looks.<br>After all, Nangong Yifan was not merely insulting Wuming Yuanzhi, but he was insulting all of them. This of course included Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Wuming Yuanzhi, why are you still standing there?! Do not hold back against someone like that! Ruthlessly teach him a lesson! Otherwise&hellip; you will never be able to raise your head again!&rdquo; Kong Ci shouted.<br>This was the first time in Kong Ci&rsquo;s history of knowing Wuming Yuanzhi that she wanted him to win in a fight.<br>&ldquo;Go ahead and use whatever abilities you possess. In any case, the outcome will be the same.&rdquo; said Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Since that&rsquo;s the case, I, Wuming Yuanzhi, shall have you experience it.&rdquo;<br>As Wuming Yuanzhi spoke, white gaseous flames poured from his body. The white gaseous flames resembled both mist and clouds. After they appeared, the surrounding martial power started to be affected by it.<br>From the effect of the white gaseous flames, Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s cultivation increased once again. From rank three Exalted, his cultivation increased to rank four Exalted.<br>&ldquo;It's appeared! It&rsquo;s the Cloudmist Power!&rdquo;<br>Seeing the white gaseous flames, many people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield shouted out with excitement.<br>Even without other people informing him, Chu Feng was able to sense that the reason why Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s cultivation increased again was because he had used a treasure.<br>However, that was not an ordinary treasure. Ordinary treasures couldn&rsquo;t possibly increase one&rsquo;s cultivation at the Exalted realm.<br>Thus, it was most definitely a very rare treasure, a treasure akin to the Cyan Nethersoul that Linghu Hongfei possessed.<br>That said, Chu Feng was able to tell that Linghu Hongfei had managed to attain an even more thorough fusion with his Cyan Nethersoul. Although Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s so-called Cloudmist Power was also capable of increasing his cultivation by a level, there were still flaws present. At the very least, its fusion with Wuming Yuanzhi was not good enough.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng discovered that Wuming Yuanzhi seemed to be straining to keep the Cloudmist Power active. This meant that even though the Cloudmist Power was able to increase his cultivation, he had to pay quite a price to activate it.<br>All of this would in turn affect his battle power.<br>That said, it could not be denied that being able to use a treasure to increase one&rsquo;s cultivation by a level at the Exalted realm was an extraordinary feat.<br>It was not something that could be accomplished overnight. Wuming Yuanzhi must&rsquo;ve put forth a lot of effort and paid rather considerably in order to use this Cloudmist Power.<br>&ldquo;Is this even meaningful?&rdquo;<br>Nangong Yifan sneered. Then, dark red flames suddenly emerged from his body.<br>The flames immediately started changing shape. Soon, they had created an armor of flames that covered him.<br>At that moment, Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s cultivation increased again. Like Wuming Yuanzhi, his cultivation increased from rank three Exalted to rank four Exalted.<br>After the flame armor appeared, the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations began to cheer with excitement.<br>As for the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations, the anger and displeasure on their faces increased.<br>Even though both Nangong Yifan and Wuming Yuanzhi were using treasures that could increase their cultivations, Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s treasure, in terms of both might and grandeur, surpassed that of Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s treasure.<br>That said, Chu Feng was able to tell that the degree of fusion Nangong Yifan had with his treasure was still inferior to that of Linghu Hongfei and his Cyan Nethersoul.<br>In other words, while Nangong Yifan had a better grasp of his treasure compared to Wuming Yuanzhi, it was still&hellip; inferior to Linghu Hongfei.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>After Nangong Yifan increased his cultivation, Wuming Yuanzhi did not immediately rush to attack like he had previously. Instead, he burst into loud laughter.<br>&ldquo;Nangong Yifan, did you think that my Cloudmist Power was my final trump card? If you thought that, then you&rsquo;re truly looking down on me, Wuming Yuanzhi.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since Miss Kong Ci wants me to go all-out against you, you shall have the honor of becoming the first person to witness my full power,&rdquo; After saying those words, Wuming Yuanzhi turned his gaze to a person from the All-heaven Starfield.<br>The person he was looking at was Beiyang Luo.<br>That Beiyang Luo could be said to be the second strongest person among the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations, inferior to only Nangong Yifan.<br>Every time Wuming Yuanzhi challenged Nangong Yifan, that Beiyang Luo would stand out to oppose him.<br>Because of that, Wuming Yuanzhi had fought Beiyang Luo multiple times. Ultimately, the two of them had ended up tying every time.<br>Thus, Beiyang Luo was the person of the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generation that had interacted with Wuming Yuanzhi the most.<br>&ldquo;Beiyang Luo, you&rsquo;ve always thought that I, Wuming Yuanzhi, was unable to defeat you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The truth is, I merely felt it to be beneath me to defeat you. Today, I will have you witness my true power.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s expression became extremely stern. However, he had closed his eyes.<br>Soon, the crowd noticed that his aura was changing. It was as if there was a fierce sleeping beast within him that was currently awakening.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Wuming Yuanzhi opened his tightly closed eyes.<br>At that moment, his eyes had turned purple.<br>To be exact, a purple imprint had appeared within his eyes.<br>Furthermore, a purple imprint had also appeared on his forehead. That imprint was the same as the one in his eyes.<br>When the imprints appeared, with his forehead as the center, vein lines began to spread throughout Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s body. Like tattoos, they soon covered his entire body with regularity.<br>Most importantly, the purple vein lines were emitting a faint light.<br>From a glance, although they appeared strange, they were very pleasant to the eye.<br>After the purple vein lines appeared, Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s cultivation increased once again. From rank four Exalted, his cultivation increased to that of a rank five Exalted.<br>&ldquo;This guy actually hid such a power?!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the expressions of those arrogant and condescending All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations all changed. This was especially true for Beiyang Luo, who had fought Wuming Yuanzhi multiple times.<br>As Beiyang Luo had fought Wuming Yuanzhi multiple times and tied with him every time, he knew all about Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s abilities. Likewise, the other younger generations of the All-heaven Starfield also knew about his abilities.<br>However, the purple vein lines that covered his body now was something that they had never seen him use before.<br>It was the first time they had realized that his strength far surpassed their own.<br>It was the first time they had realized how terrifying Wuming Yuanzhi was.<br>Terrifying. Of course Wuming Yuanzhi was terrifying.<br>One must know that his actual cultivation was only that of a rank two Exalted.<br>For geniuses, being able to increase one&rsquo;s cultivation a level above one&rsquo;s actual cultivation was very ordinary.<br>However, to be able to increase one&rsquo;s cultivation by two levels was something that only top demon-level geniuses were capable of.<br>As for increasing one&rsquo;s cultivation by three levels, regardless of whether it was done with one&rsquo;s own strength or borrowed external power, it was still something that would shock everyone.<br>Thus, even the geniuses present were astonished by Wuming Yuanzhi.<br>The reason for that was because what Wuming Yuanzhi had done was impossible for them to accomplish.<br></p></div>
