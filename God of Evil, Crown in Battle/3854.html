        <div> - Snatching Food From The Tiger&rsquo;s Den<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Starting to weaken? Why is it weakening?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;There are rumors saying that it&rsquo;s because the protective formation around the Great Monster Slaying Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb has been active for too long, and has thus weakened.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are also rumors stating that it&rsquo;s the Great Monster Slaying Emperor who deliberately set up a time for the protective formation to gradually disappear once the time arrives.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, his tomb was placed right before them. Clearly he wanted to leave the treasures inside his tomb to the people of the future generation. It was merely that it was not time yet.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And now, it is likely the time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, this is the best opportunity to open the Great Monster Slaying Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Thus, you all plan to snatch food from the tiger&rsquo;s den?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Hehe, boy, you&rsquo;re correct. Snatching food from the tiger&rsquo;s den is precisely what we&rsquo;re planning to do.&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;You all are truly bold. You actually dare to think about touching the possessions of the All-heaven Sect? Do you not plan to continue staying in the All-heaven Starfield?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, you&rsquo;re looking down on us. Do we brothers seem like people who are afraid of getting into trouble?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So what if it&rsquo;s the All-heaven Sect? We simply do not care about them at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, I wonder if brother Asura has the courage to accompany us in snatching food from the tiger&rsquo;s den?&rdquo; asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a question of whether or not I dare to do so, but rather a question of why I should cooperate with you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you think that you&rsquo;re trustworthy?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;re trustworthy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, I&rsquo;m already addressing you as brother. I&rsquo;m truly considering you as a brother.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No matter how despicable and shameless we Mystic Cave Saints might be, we will never screw over our brothers.&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, your manner of conduct makes it truly impossible for me to believe you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, I don't have any interest in the treasures of that Great Monster Slaying Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, it&rsquo;s one thing for you to be uninterested in treasures, but could you possibly be uninterested in becoming a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, you should know that a world spiritist&rsquo;s battle power will become extremely strong after reaching Saint-cloak.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists have a battle power on par with rank one Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists have a battle power on par with rank five Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If one is able to become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, one&rsquo;s battle power will be on par with a rank one Utmost Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I know that brother Asura is also superbly talented in martial cultivation. However, I suspect that brother Asura&rsquo;s current cultivation is only that of an Exalted. Likely, there&rsquo;s still a certain amount of distance before you can become a peak Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for Utmost Exalted, it would be even more remote for you. In fact, it is even possible that you won&rsquo;t be able to become an Utmost Exalted as a person of the younger generation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the current you is only a step away from becoming a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;re able to become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, you will be able to possess battle power on par with a rank one Utmost Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back then, the Great Monster Slaying Emperor had obtained a treasure. Reportedly, that treasure contained an enormous amount of spirit power. To Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists, that treasure is simply an enormous enticement. After all&hellip; that treasure is capable of allowing a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist to make a breakthrough to Dragon Mark in a very short period of time.&rdquo; The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints appeared somewhat excited as he said those words.<br>It was unknown if the treasure was truly that enticing, or if he truly hoped that Chu Feng would join them.<br>&ldquo;Thus, the true purpose that you all have in snatching food from the tiger&rsquo;s den is that treasure?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That is indeed the case. Our main target is that treasure. That said&hellip; if there are any other treasures, we will naturally not leave them hanging either.&rdquo; The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints let out a vulgar laugh.<br>&ldquo;Then what is the name of the treasure that you spoke of? What does it look like?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, you&rsquo;re being insincere now. Are you trying to scout out my knowledge to then seek out that treasure yourself?&rdquo; asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. Do I seem like that sort of person?&rdquo;<br>Although that was what Chu Feng said, he was actually thinking about seeking out that treasure on his own.<br>He merely did not imagine that the Mystic Cave Saints were not so stupid. On the contrary, that old codger seemed to be quite shrewd.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, I will secretly tell you this. We have a map of the interior of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should you be willing to cooperate with us, we guarantee that we will share the treasures equally with you. As for that treasure that is able to allow us to make a breakthrough, we will also share it with you." said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;That Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb has never been opened before. You&rsquo;re telling me you all have a map of the interior? Do you think I&rsquo;m a fool?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re not thinking outside the box here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This map came from many years ago. It is not something drawn by the future generations. Instead, it was drawn when the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb was being constructed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Regardless, I am not lying to you. We brothers are sincerely inviting you to accompany us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We fancy your moral quality and admire your personal conduct. Furthermore, we need your world spirit techniques to assist us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, we are not in a rush for an answer from you right now. You can think things over.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, brother Asura, even if you don't agree to cooperate with us, we will not blame you. After all, that is your own decision.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if you are to go to the All-heaven Sect and inform them about our plan to rob the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb, I will truly look down on you." said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured. I, Asura, am not that sort of person." said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I believe in brother Asura&rsquo;s character. In that case, brother Asura, I will take my leave. Think things over and give me an answer tomorrow, because we brothers will be leaving tomorrow." said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Why are you in such a hurry to leave?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why not stay a couple more days? Could you all have managed to decipher all of the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s treasures?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Decipher my ass. Those were simply not valuable treasures at all. That damned old woman Han Xiu simply didn&rsquo;t trust us, and suspected that the YinYang Soulsealing Rope we gave her was a fake.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why she had us stay, so that she could test out the validity of that YinYang Soulsealing Rope during this period of time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And now that the damned old woman has verified the YinYang Soulsealing Rope to be real, we are no longer useful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;She was actually the one who gave the order to drive us out.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Motherfucking hell. That damned old woman is simply beyond shameless!&rdquo;<br>When mentioning this matter, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints immediately became furious.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng finally realized why the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster had decided to invite tigers into her home.<br>Turned out, it was because she didn&rsquo;t trust them.<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right, what&rsquo;s the usage of that YinYang Soulsealing Rope?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That YinYang Soulsealing Rope is a remarkable item. That said, very few people know of its usage.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, do you really want to know of its usage?&rdquo; the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints asked in a mystifying manner.<br>&ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Hehe. If you are to agree to cooperate with us and accompany us in robbing that Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb, robbing the treasures of the All-heaven Sect, I will tell you what the usage of that YinYang Soulsealing Rope is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Well then, farewell, brother Asura. I will wait for your answer.&rdquo;<br>After the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints finished saying those words, he waved his hand and left.<br>Seeing the back of the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints, Chu Feng cursed with a low voice, &ldquo;That old bastard is truly petty. He actually put forth a condition for even something like that?&rdquo;<br>Right after that, Chu Feng entered deep contemplation.<br>He had planned to enter the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb from the beginning.<br>Even if he wasn&rsquo;t there to snatch the treasures, he was going to cause some trouble for the All-heaven Sect.<br>Thus, there was no need for him to ponder the matter at all. He was definitely going to enter the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>What Chu Feng was wondering was whether or not join hands with the Mystic Cave Saints.<br></p></div>
