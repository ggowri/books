        <div>: The Lightning Beast Offers ItsGuidance<br>&ldquo;Milord, I-I also had my own difficulties!&rdquo; Little Crescent said with a quivering voice.<br>However, the red lightning beast didn&rsquo;t respond. This left Little Crescent at a loss. The lack of response from the red lightning beast only served to further unnerve her.<br>Eggy watched this sight with a calm face, but she couldn&rsquo;t help but think that the world was truly large. Little Crescent was an existence far beyond what she and Chu Feng could deal with, but the lightning beast manifested from Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline terrified her to such an extent.<br>Little Crescent should have known better than anyone that the bloodline powers manifested inside the boundless space couldn&rsquo;t hurt her, but she couldn&rsquo;t control her own emotions. She was still frightened.<br>However, the truth was that the lightning beast&rsquo;s attention wasn&rsquo;t on Little Crescent. It was in the midst of conversing with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Elder, why didn&rsquo;t you show yourself earlier? Milady Queen nearly died!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had just witnessed the sheer destructive prowess of the lightning beast earlier. This was a power that could destroy entire galaxies! With this power, he could have saved Eggy and stopped her from igniting her own life force.<br>&ldquo;You brat! Love must have gotten to your head. I can only directly use my power here because of the special nature of this space! Outside here, I&rsquo;d need a medium to exert my power. What can I do when my medium is incompetent?&rdquo; the lightning beast replied.<br>&ldquo;Are you talking about me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who else?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was rendered speechless. He wasn&rsquo;t really blaming the lightning beast, just venting his pent-up frustration, but he ended up getting criticized here.<br>&ldquo;Besides, you weren&rsquo;t in danger at all. Your protection formation would have saved you. That lass got impatient and did something reckless. If there&rsquo;s anything to blame, it&rsquo;d be her feelings for you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt a pang of pain in his heart.<br>Indeed, he had already told Eggy that he had a protection formation inside him, but she still put her life on the line to protect him. She must have been worried that he was lying to her about the protection formation.<br>However, he didn&rsquo;t allow his emotions to sweep him away. This was the first time his bloodline was communicating with him; he didn&rsquo;t want to let this opportunity slip past his fingers.<br>&ldquo;Elder, you&rsquo;re finally willing to talk to me. I have waited many long years for this,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a pitiful tone.<br>&ldquo;Stop getting absorbed in your self-pity. There are cultivators out there who have lived for tens of thousands of years but didn&rsquo;t get to talk to their bloodline till the day they die. How many years have you lived?&rdquo; the lightning beast berated him.<br>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng was rendered speechless. There was some sense in what the other party said.<br>&ldquo;Whether I can appear or not ultimately depends on you. If you remain weak, I won&rsquo;t be able to help you even if I want to. A cultivator is the medium of power. It won&rsquo;t matter how great your bloodline is if you aren&rsquo;t strong enough to harness its power. That&rsquo;s why some people are able to raise their cultivation by three ranks via their bloodline power whereas others are only able to raise it by one rank.<br>&ldquo;Intelligence plays a part, but what&rsquo;s more important is their grasp over their bloodline. They have to be able to properly control the power bestowed upon them by their bloodline, or else they would only be courting their own death.<br>&ldquo;Under normal circumstances, your cultivation is far from sufficient to meet me yet, but I&rsquo;ll at least concede that your talent is passable. It&rsquo;s a good thing that you embarked on the Dao of Specialization; it&rsquo;ll grant you a greater grasp of your bloodline. Your ability to use Lightning Wings at Half-God level proves that. The issue still boils down to your weak cultivation. Your control is decent, but your body is still too weak. In fact, our meeting right now comes with its own risks,&rdquo; the lightning beast said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I&rsquo;m not afraid of risks. Since you are already here, why don&rsquo;t you offer me some help in advancing my cultivation? I&rsquo;d be truly thankful if you could supply me with some martial power,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Stop dreaming. Cultivation is on the cultivator itself. Why else would cultivators work that hard if they could just lie down at home and wait for their bloodline to strengthen them?&rdquo;<br>Once again, Chu Feng was rendered speechless by the lightning beast&rsquo;s words. He couldn&rsquo;t argue against facts.<br>&ldquo;Brat, you have seen what I&rsquo;m capable of, but how much I can exert ultimately depends on you. I&rsquo;ll repeat this one last time:<br>you are the medium<br>. The stronger you are, the more power I can grant you. You&rsquo;ll only explode if I forcefully bestow you with power beyond your means to deal with. In conventional terms, it would be a cultivation deviation. Do you get it now?&rdquo; the lightning beast said.<br>&ldquo;I understand. But elder, it wasn&rsquo;t easy for you to manifest yourself. It would be good if you could even offer me a bit of pointer.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng knew how powerful the lightning beast was, and he understood that he was incapable of harnessing that power at the moment. However, this was a rare meeting between him and his lightning beast. It felt like he was losing out if he didn&rsquo;t get more out of this precious opportunity.<br>&ldquo;I guess I can at least do that much. First, the activation condition of your protection formation is very stringent, but it&rsquo;s actually a martial power formation. You can try to sense and control it with your martial power. If you&rsquo;re able to grasp control of the formation, you&rsquo;ll be able to activate it whenever you want to. That would help to prevent tragedies like that lass sacrificing herself to save you from happening.<br>&ldquo;Second, the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes is an incomplete skill. It&rsquo;s a forbidden skill that depletes a person&rsquo;s bloodline. Once, there was a person with decent talent but a weak body who managed to grasp the Second Slash, but he died right after executing it.&rdquo;<br>Those words alarmed Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment, elder! That person died the first time he executed the Second Slash?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m saying. Think about how many times you have used it, including the times you used the First Slash and Second Slash in succession. If not for your willpower and physical resilience, you would have already dropped dead by now.<br>&ldquo;I thought that you would learn your lesson, but you kept using it nonstop. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong with your head. Don&rsquo;t you know that you&rsquo;re hurting not just yourself but us as well? Don&rsquo;t ever use the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes again unless you have the ability to correct it.<br>&ldquo;Though I should also tell you that many people have tried to improve the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes but failed. It&rsquo;s an inherently flawed skill that cannot be completed. It should have never been created in the first place, so I&rsquo;d advise you not to waste your time on it.<br>&ldquo;How about this? I&rsquo;ll impart my means to you, but it&rsquo;ll be up to you to grasp it. However, you shouldn&rsquo;t try to absorb it unless you are absolutely confident, or else you&rsquo;ll risk losing me and my power. Without me, your bloodline will no longer be complete, and your fighting prowess will be severely discounted even if you master your control afterward.<br>&ldquo;Also, the path of cultivation is a gradual and slow process, so don&rsquo;t bear too much expectation of my means. Just think of it as an ordinary martial skill.&rdquo;<br>The boundless space began to shudder as the lightning beast morphed into a red lightning bolt and seeped into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. This influx of energy repaired Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, almost as if he had never suffered any injuries.<br>The boundless space suddenly began to shake violently. Countless cracks started to appear all around.<br>Boom!<br>With a loud explosion, the boundless space shattered. The massive gate also began to crumble.<br>Eggy stiffened up at that sight. Worry could be seen on her face.<br>To her relief, Chu Feng suddenly appeared on the palace&rsquo;s ceiling and plummeted to the ground. Eggy heaved a sigh of relief.<br>Neither Little Crescent nor Eggy was able to listen to the conversation between Chu Feng and the lightning beast, so Little Crescent couldn&rsquo;t help but look at Chu Feng with fearful eyes. It was not that she was really afraid of Chu Feng, but the red lightning beast she had seen earlier was simply too scary.<br>Chu Feng rushed over to Eggy&rsquo;s side. Upon seeing her condition, his eyes started to redden. He could tell that she was in a precarious state. She didn&rsquo;t possess her cultivation, and her aura was unstable. Even her body was manifested out of black gaseous flames, looking as if she would dissipate at any moment.<br>He didn&rsquo;t even dare to touch her.<br>&ldquo;Why are you acting like that, Chu Feng? I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;<br>Eggy noticed Chu Feng&rsquo;s reddened eyes and tried to console him. She even reached out to touch his face. As much as Chu Feng was worried about her, she was worried about him too.<br>Chu Feng squeezed out a smile for Eggy before he turned to Little Crescent and said, &ldquo;I have cleared your trial. Please save her right away.&rdquo;<br>Little Crescent conjured a spirit formation gate with a wave of her hand and said, &ldquo;Your Milady Queen won&rsquo;t die for the time being. Let&rsquo;s head out first. I&rsquo;ll fill you in on the details.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up. He refused to leave.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, open your world spirit gate. I want to head back,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>Chu Feng quickly did as he was told. He also thought that it was safer for Eggy to stay in his World Spirit Space considering her current state. She immediately rushed up and picked up the feather she had left behind. A relieved smile flashed across her face.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Chu Feng only realized now that there was a feather lying in his World Spirit Space.<br>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; Eggy replied with a smile. &ldquo;Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s head out first.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng glanced at Little Crescent before finally entering the spirit formation gate. He was transported to a beautiful forest, but he was in no mood to admire its aesthetics.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s with your lightning beast? Why did only one appear? Did it acknowledge you, or did something else happen?&rdquo; Eggy asked out of curiosity.<br>&ldquo;Give me a moment, Eggy.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng suddenly remembered something and projected his consciousness into his own dantian. Just as he had expected, there was a slight change in his dantian.<br>Of the nine lightning beasts, eight of them continued roaming inside the boundless world inside his dantian with an imposing air, almost as if they were the rulers of the world. However, the red lightning was no longer just a simple lightning beast anymore.<br>The red lightning was still as huge as it was before, but there was a slight change in its form. There was a bamboo slip manifested out of lightning lodged inside its body, but its contents had been sealed off, disallowing Chu Feng from reading what was on it.<br></div>
