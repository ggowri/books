        <h1>Chapter 1299</h1>
        <div> - A Humiliating Torment<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Wh, wh, what do you plan to do?&rdquo; At this moment, Dai Shu was completely panicking. The calmness that he had displayed earlier was no longer there, in its place was an endless amount of terror.<br>They were in the middle of nowhere, the perfect place to kill someone. Else, he would not have chosen to try to kill Chu Feng at this place.<br>However, the status between the two of them had been completely reversed. He, who should be the one killing Chu Feng, had instead become Chu Feng&rsquo;s prey.<br>He was afraid, extremely afraid, afraid from the bottom of his heart. Although this place was technically still the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s territory, as a member of the World Spiritist Alliance, he knew very well that there was no one guarding this place.<br>If Chu Feng was truly daring enough to kill him and eliminate his body, no one would be able to determine where he had died and who he had been killed by.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not planning to do much. Merely, I want to let you know what sort of price one must pay for attacking me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You dare? Where do you think this is? Who do you think I am?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you dare to do anything to me here, not only will you not be able to leave safely, your relatives will also be implicated by you.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the situation was extremely bad, Dai Shu fiercely threatened Chu Feng. He wanted to scare Chu Feng with the World Spiritist Alliance and make it so that Chu Feng would not act recklessly.<br>&ldquo;Is that so? In that case, I would like to see if I really will not be able to leave safely after killing you.&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, lightning began to flicker in his eyes. His expression had also turned ice-cold. At the same time, a boundless amount of killing intent covered the entire region. Like demons hiding in the black clouds, Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing intent completely surrounded Dai Shu, sealing off all paths of escape for him.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t kill me!&rdquo; Sensing Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing intent, Dai Shu started to shiver in fear. As his legs grew weak, a stream of heat rolled down the crotch of his trousers, wetting them.<br>In an instant, a foul smell emerged. Upon smelling it, Chu Feng frowned. He then displayed a disdainful smile and said, &ldquo;Look at how useless you are.&rdquo;<br>Seeing Dai Shu&rsquo;s current appearance, Chu Feng lost his intention to kill. Although this fellow had had the intent to kill Chu Feng earlier, he was actually an enormous coward.<br>For people like him, even if they were to be let go, they would not make trouble for him in the future . That was because they did not possess the potential to do so.<br>Thus, to Chu Feng, killing someone like that would be letting them off lightly. Thus, he felt that it would be better to let Dai Shu live so that he could see the gap in strength that would grow between them and regret the decision that he had made today and forever live in fear.<br>However, Dai Shu&rsquo;s earlier killing intent had been extremely deep. If it wasn't for Chu Feng being extremely powerful, this Dai Shu would definitely not have let him leave safely. It was likely that Chu Feng would&rsquo;ve lost his life to this Dai Shu today.<br>Thus, to people like him, even if Chu Feng were to spare his life, he would not allow him to leave peacefully, there must be some sort of punishment.<br>Thinking till this point, Chu Feng grabbed onto Dai Shu&rsquo;s collar with one hand and clenched his other hand into a fist, and smashed it down violently on Dai Shu&rsquo;s face.<br>With merely a couple punches, Dai Shu&rsquo;s face became bloody and swollen. Not only was his nose smashed so hard that it collapsed, not only were his teeth all shattered, one of his eyes was even blinded.<br>However, Chu Feng was still unable to dissolve his anger. Thus, his fist turned into a claw, and he grabbed onto Dai Shu&rsquo;s shoulder and twisted his arm apart.<br>After that, Chu Feng suddenly kicked Dai Shu&rsquo;s right leg, ruthlessly breaking it.<br>&ldquo;Ahhh~~~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Forgive me, forgive me, I beg of you! Brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re my granddaddy, you&rsquo;re my ancestor, please, I beg of you, forgive me, don&rsquo;t hit me anymore.&rdquo;<br>In merely an instant, Dai Shu&rsquo;s body was covered with bruises and cuts. However, other than screaming, Dai Shu did not dare to say anything about Chu Feng&rsquo;s beating. Like a grandson, he began to beg Chu Feng for forgiveness nonstop.<br>Chu Feng suddenly stopped beating Dai Shu and coldly said, &ldquo;Scram. Your granddaddy Chu Feng is in a good mood today, so I&rsquo;ll let you go,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You, you&rsquo;re really letting me go?&rdquo; Hearing that Chu Feng was planning to let him go, Dai Shu was extremely shocked. He looked to Chu Feng with an expression of suspicion; he did not dare to believe what Chu Feng said to be real.<br>&ldquo;Scram right now,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;Thank you Brother Chu Feng, thank you Brother Chu Feng!&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng nodded, Dai Shu immediately began to stagger, rolled and crawled back up from the ground. Then, without caring about anything else, he soared into the sky and began flying toward the direction of the World Spiritist Alliance.<br>Dai Shu&rsquo;s speed was extremely fast. In a flash of an eye, he had already rushed several miles away. When he turned around and did not see Chu Feng behind him, he thought that Chu Feng had really let him go.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, just you wait, once I return to the World Spiritist Alliance, I will find my senior brothers to help me. I&rsquo;ll let you know what the consequences of beating me, Dai Shu, will be.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, Dai Shu was gnashing his teeth in anger. His cowardly appearance from before was no longer present on him. Instead, it was completely replaced with a sinister appearance.<br>&ldquo;Buzz.&rdquo; However, right at this moment, an enormous spirit formation suddenly covered the sky and earth. The speed at which that spirit formation formed was so extremely fast that it instantly surpassed Dai Shu, trapping him within it.<br>When Dai Shu turned his head around, his expression immediately took a huge change. That was because, at this moment, Chu Feng had appeared behind him. Furthermore, he was also within the spirit formation. It was very evident that it was Chu Feng who created this spirit formation.<br>When he saw the spirit formation, Dai Shu began to sweat cold bullets. He was scared witless.<br>As Dai Shu was a gold-cloak world spiritist, he was able to tell how extremely powerful the spirit formation before him was. With his strength, it was impossible for him to break the formation using martial power, nor was it possible for him to create an opening using world spirit techniques. There was simply no way for him to get out from this spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you&hellip; you&hellip; you&hellip; you can&rsquo;t go back on your words.&rdquo; At this moment, Dai Shu&rsquo;s expression was extremely ugly. He was crying his heart out.<br>He didn&rsquo;t know whether Chu Feng was actually planning to let him go or not let him go. Either way, he felt that he was being played to the death by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, am always one to keep my word. Since I said that I would let you go, I will naturally let you go.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, with your current appearance, how could you possibly explain yourself to your seniors and the elders of the World Spiritist Alliance upon your return? Quickly heal your injuries, it is not too late for you to return after you&rsquo;ve healed yourself,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing what Chu Feng said, Dai Shu was simply about to burst with rage. Chu Feng&rsquo;s intention was very obvious, he was telling Dai Shu to remove all evidence of Chu Feng&rsquo;s beating.<br>As matters stood, he had no choice but to admit that Chu Feng was extremely treacherous. However, there was nothing that he could do about it; his only option was to follow Chu Feng&rsquo;s orders.<br>Thus, Dai Shu began to take medicines to heal himself on the spot. At the same time, he set up a spirit formation to restore the eye that had been destroyed by Chu Feng, as well as rapidly healing his other injuries, including the arm and leg that had been broken by Chu Feng.<br>Dai Shu used practically all the techniques he knew to heal himself with the fastest speed.<br>He did not dare to go slowly. That was because he was afraid, he was afraid that Chu Feng would suddenly change his mind and decide to kill him.<br>&ldquo;Hah&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing Dai Shu who was covered with blood, who only had one working arm and leg, hurriedly trying to heal himself, Chu Feng chuckled lightly.<br>Chu Feng then decided to sit in the sky in a cross-legged position, and started to watch Dai Shu as if he were enjoying a show.<br>The spirit formation that Chu Feng had set up was a dual-layer spirit formation. The first layer was a sealing formation, and the second layer was a concealing formation.<br>Thus, Chu Feng was not worried that someone would discover them, nor was he worried that someone would find out that he had beaten up Dai Shu. He had done all this because he wanted to see Dai Shu&rsquo;s current appearance with his own eyes.<br>&ldquo;Crap, this aura.&rdquo; Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze changed greatly. He hurriedly turned his gaze toward the direction of the World Spiritist Alliance.<br>Right at this moment, a bust of very powerful energy had arrived from that direction. Following a loud &lsquo;bang,&rsquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s sealing formation and concealing formation were both destroyed.<br>After the two formations were destroyed, an old man slowly appeared from the chaotic energy ripples.<br>It was evident that this old man had destroyed Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formations.<br></p></div>
