        <h1>Chapter 3672</h1>
        <div> - Three City Masters<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for the person standing on the right, it was a middle-aged man. That man had a very robust build, and was wearing golden armor. He resembled a war god, and appeared very imposing and majestic.<br>He was also an Utmost Exalted-level expert.<br>As for the person standing in the middle, he was simply too ordinary when compared to the two people beside him.<br>He was a somewhat messy-looking man. There was no spirit in his eyes. He had a shaggy beard, and wore simple clothes. In fact, he was even wearing straw sandals, and there was mud on his legs.<br>He looked like a farmer that had just come from the farm.<br>However, standing there, no one dared to show any contempt towards him.<br>The woman was Monstrous Holy City&rsquo;s City Master, Xian Yuying.<br>As for the man in golden armor, he was the Divine Body Royal City&rsquo;s City Master, Kong Shanwu.<br>As for the person standing in the middle, he was Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s City Master, Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Lord City Master!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lady City Master!!!&rdquo;<br>Seeing those three City Masters, the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations reacted as if they had seen their saviors. Immediately, they got behind the three City Masters.<br>With grievance on their faces, they began to voice their complaints of what Beiyang Duchuan had done to them.<br>&ldquo;Beiyang Duchuan, you&rsquo;ve truly grown more and more outrageous. You actually dared to touch the people of our Three Cities?&rdquo; Monstrous Holy City&rsquo;s City Master Xian Yuyin asked with anger pulsing in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, you don&rsquo;t want to bring those younger generations of your All-heaven Sect back with you, right?&rdquo;<br>Compared to the Monstrous Holy City&rsquo;s City Master, the Divine Body Royal City&rsquo;s City Master decided to strengthen his oppressive might as he spoke.<br>At that moment, Beiyang Duchuan&rsquo;s complexion turned very ugly. As for Nangong Yifan and the other younger generations, pain was present on their faces.<br>&ldquo;Misunderstanding. This is all a misunderstanding. How could I possibly bully the young? I was merely trying to scare that Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Beiyang Duchuan, who was extremely aggressive earlier, actually had a terrified look on his face now.<br>&ldquo;Misunderstanding?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I see that you feel that the people of our Ancestral Martial Starfield are all easy to bully, right?&rdquo; asked the Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s City Master.<br>&ldquo;No, of course not. I wouldn&rsquo;t possibly dare think that way. Our All-heaven Starfield has always had a friendly relationship with your Ancestral Martial Starfield. How could we possibly think that way?&rdquo; explained Beiyang Duchuan.<br>&ldquo;I will not make things difficult for you. Apologize to young master Chu Feng, and I will consider this matter dropped,&rdquo; said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s City Master.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, earlier, this old man truly didn&rsquo;t plan to do anything to you. It was merely a joke. Please don&rsquo;t take offense to it, please don&rsquo;t take offense.&rdquo;<br>Without any hesitation, Beiyang Duchuan immediately started apologizing to Chu Feng.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that Beiyang Duchuan was a coward. It was simply that the Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s City Master&rsquo;s gaze was simply soo fierce. Met with that gaze, even he felt great fear.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough. Since you&rsquo;ve come here, you&rsquo;re a guest. Today, we&rsquo;ll consider it as if you were really joking. However, you absolutely must not make this sort of joke again. Otherwise, our Three Cities will have to pay a visit to your All-heaven Sect,&rdquo; said the Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s City Master.<br>&ldquo;City Master Long, surely you jest,&rdquo; Beiyang Duchuan smiled awkwardly.<br>&ldquo;Enough with the superfluous words. Scram,&rdquo; different from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s City Master, the Divine Body Royal City&rsquo;s City Master was much more direct, and actually cursed out Beiyang Duchuan.<br>Beiyang Duchuan&rsquo;s expression turned very ugly. No matter what, he was a Supreme Elder of the All-heaven Sect. Yet, he was actually being insulted like that before his sect&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>Unfortunately, there was nothing he could do. He had no choice but to lower his head in such a situation. No matter how displeased he might feel, he did not dare to erupt in anger.<br>Not only that, but he also had to be very respectful toward the three City Masters. After courteously bidding his farewell, Beiyang Duchuan turned around and prepared to leave.<br>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; however, when Beiyang Duchuan was preparing to leave with the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s younger generations, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s City Master suddenly spoke.<br>Hearing that, Beiyang Duchuan trembled. When he turned around, the crowd could see that he was actually sweating cold sweat in fear.<br>&ldquo;City Master Long, is there anything else you need?&rdquo; Beiyang Duchuan&rsquo;s voice was trembling with fear.<br>&ldquo;You must also know what has been happening in our Ancestral Martial Starfield recently, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, regardless of what might be happening, it remains an internal affair of our Ancestral Martial Starfield. I hope that the All-heaven Sect will not involve itself in this. Otherwise&hellip; we of the Three Cities will definitely not watch from the sidelines.&rdquo;<br>The Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s City Master had an extremely cold gaze as he said those words.<br>This frightened Beiyang Duchuan so much that he started to tremble slightly. He hurriedly replied, &ldquo;Of course, of course.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Good. You can leave,&rdquo; the Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s City Master said as he waved his hand.<br>Not daring to hesitate, Beiyang Duchuan hurriedly turned around and left with the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>When even Beiyang Duchuan was terrified by the scene earlier, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s younger generations would naturally be even more terrified.<br>Thus, they were completely silent whilst leaving. Not a single person said anything. The atmosphere was very awkward.<br>It was only after they felt that they&rsquo;d journeyed far enough that Nangong Yifan was finally unable to contain himself. He asked, &ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, they are merely the City Masters of the Three Cities. I&rsquo;ve heard that they&rsquo;re only rank one Utmost Exalted, like you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Being of the same cultivation, why would you be so afraid of them? Your behavior is simply too much of a disgrace to our All-heaven Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Nangong Yifan, watch your words. Wasn&rsquo;t it because of your defeat to that Chu Feng that I ended up being disgraced? Did I not end up in that awkward situation because I was trying to stand up for you?&rdquo; Beiyang Duchuan asked angrily. Although his voice was not loud and resounding, it was very ear-piercing.<br>Not only that, but his facial expression was also very terrifying. His eyes were blood-red giving him a fierce appearance. He seemed like he was about to eat someone.<br>Beiyang Duchuan was already brimming with anger after being suppressed by the Three Cities&rsquo; City Masters. For Nangong Yifan to ask such a criticizing question, he would naturally unleash all his suppressed anger onto Nangong Yifan.<br>Nangong Yifan was extremely tyrannical. He never paid any attention to the fellow younger generations of his All-heaven Sect.<br>However, he did not dare to act excessively impudent against the person before him. No matter what, Beiyang Duchuan was a Supreme Elder of their All-heaven Sect. Seeing that Beiyang Duchuan was enraged, Nangong Yifan did not dare say anything else.<br></p></div>
