        <h1>Chapter 3485</h1>
        <div> - The Battle Between The Strongest Geniuses<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Wuming Xingyun spoke. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s normal for you all be unable to see it. After all, young friend Chu Feng has deliberately concealed his spirit power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Concealed his spirit power? One can do such a thing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, why would he conceal his spirit power?&rdquo; The crowd were skeptical of Wuming Xingyun&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;You would have to ask young friend Chu Feng as to why he&rsquo;s concealing his spirit power,&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun looked to Chu Feng, and the crowd also turned their eyes to him.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, boundless Saint-level spirit power exploded from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>His spirit power was incomparably bright and dazzling. Being offset by the Saint-level spirit power, Chu Feng resembled a god that had descended upon the world of mortals.<br>&ldquo;This!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the people that were skeptical of Chu Feng being a Saint-cloak World Spiritist were all startled.<br>The people of the younger generation that had hurled insults at Chu Feng were all stupefied.<br>There was naturally a reason why he had concealed his spirit power, only to reveal it at that moment.<br>Originally, Chu Feng had planned to conceal his power so as to launch a surprise attack at Linghu Hongfei.<br>Unfortunately for him, he had underestimated the experts present. He did not expect that they would be able to see through him.<br>Since he was already exposed, there was naturally no need to try to keep things a secret anymore.<br>However, this was not the most important aspect.<br>What was most important was dealing with Linghu Hongfei.<br>There was a massive disparity in strength between Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei. If Chu Feng wanted to obtain superiority in the following battle against Linghu Hongfei, he had to reveal his spirit power now.<br>&ldquo;Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Could it be&hellip; Chu Feng is the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist in the history of our Ancestral Martial Starfield?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He is the person who rejected Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan outside the Ice Summit days ago?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That must be the case. With this, everything makes sense now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others would think so highly of him. It turns out that he&rsquo;s the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Amazing, truly amazing. As expected of Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son. This talent surpasses all others.&rdquo;<br>The crowd burst into an uproar. Regardless of whether they were people that were fond of Chu Feng, people that hated Chu Feng, or people that were complete strangers to Chu Feng, they were all astonished by his strength.<br>Such a young Saint-cloak World Spiritist. While no one dared to declare that there wouldn&rsquo;t be someone in the future that could surpass him in becoming a Saint-cloak World Spiritist at an even younger age, he was definitely unprecedented in the entire history of the Ancestral Martial Starfield!!!<br>&ldquo;Amazing! Big sister, Chu Feng is amazing!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So he&rsquo;s actually that Saint-cloak World Spiritist. It&rsquo;s no wonder his casual pointers would allow me to cure Lil Thorn by myself. So he&rsquo;s actually this powerful!&rdquo;<br>Gong Qing grabbed Gong MIngyue&rsquo;s hand. She was not only extremely excited, but there was also a look of pride on her delicate little face. She was feeling pride at being Chu Feng&rsquo;s friend.<br>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right. He&rsquo;s that powerful. Whereas I&hellip;&rsquo; Gong Mingyue was silent. An extremely oppressive feeling filled her heart.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s excellence continuously challenged how much her heart could bear.<br>She was on the verge of collapsing from the pressure.<br>&hellip;...<br>&ldquo;Milord, am I allowed to challenge Linghu Hongfei now?&rdquo; Chu Feng raised his head and looked at Wuming Ken.<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve already defeated your opponent, you are naturally allowed to challenge whoever you wish to challenge,&rdquo; Wuming Ken said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, milord.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng suddenly leaped forth after he finished saying those words.<br>As Chu Feng leaped forth, the spirit power that filled his surroundings also flew up with him.<br>At that moment, it appeared as if there were two enormous wings on Chu Feng&rsquo;s back.<br>Just like that, before the focus of the vast crowd, together with his boundless Saint-level spirit power, Chu Feng landed on Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s fighting stage.<br>At the moment when Chu Feng landed, gasps of astonishment could be heard from all over the sea of people.<br>They were all gasping in admiration, because Saint-level spirit power was extremely dazzling to begin with. For it to appear on a person of the younger generation was simply even more dazzling, and akin to a miracle.<br>Hearing the gasps of admiration from the crowd, Linghu Hongfei, although showing no change on the surface, was raging with anger in his heart.<br>The crowd&rsquo;s gasps of admiration should be his. Yet, all of it was snatched away by Chu Feng.<br>That said, there were also a lot of voices calling into question whether or not Chu Feng was actually capable.<br>&ldquo;Is Chu Feng really planning to challenge Linghu Hongfei?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, Linghu Hongfei is a rank two Exalted. Even if he&rsquo;s a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, his battle power will still be limited. How exactly is he supposed to challenge Linghu Hongfei, a rank two Exalted?&rdquo;<br>Confusion filled the crowd&rsquo;s minds.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that Saint-cloak World Spiritists possess power on par with rank one Exalted,&rdquo; someone said.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case? Saint-cloak World Spiritists actually possess such strong battle power?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were astonished to hear that.<br>The crowd all admitted that world spirit techniques were marvelous. However, the crowd had never before witnessed the battle power of world spirit techniques.<br>As such, they naturally felt that the battle power of world spirit techniques would not be able to compare against martial cultivators. They believed that even Saint-cloak World Spiritists would not be able to contend against an Exalted-level expert in terms of only battle power.<br>&hellip;...<br>Although there were five fighting stages on the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound, the crowd&rsquo;s eyes were all focused on the fighting stage where Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei stood.<br>In fact, even the people of the younger generation on the four other fighting stages were not fighting one another. Instead, their eyes were also focused on the stage occupied by Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei.<br>Wuming Ken did not urge the other people of the younger generation to conduct their matches. After all, he was able to understand their behavior, as the match between Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei would be the most brilliant match in the entire competition for the Ancestral Martial Decastars. No one was willing to miss out on watching that match.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I respect your desire to challenge me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, this is an impartial competition. For the sake of respecting this stage and you, I, Linghu Hongfei, will not be going easy on you and losing deliberately.&rdquo;<br>Linghu Hongfei looked to Chu Feng with a serious expression.<br>He appeared very polite and respectful towards the selection.<br>However, Chu Feng knew very well that Linghu Hongfei wanted to use the opportunity to teach him a lesson, and never planned to go easy on him. He merely wanted to provide himself with an excuse.<br>&ldquo;Young master Linghu, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly be planning to go all-out from the get-go and kill me, right?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng asked with a joking tone. However, he was actually reminding Linghu Hongfei that there were a lot of experts present, and they would likely not allow him to kill him. Thus, Chu Feng was reminding Linghu Hongfei to not attempt something foolish and humiliating.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you can rest assured. I will not deliberately go easy on you because I respect you. However, stopping when the outcome is determined is also my principle,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei said.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, it would be for the best. Young master Linghu, please rest assured. I, Chu Feng, will also stop when the outcome is determined,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You? Someone of your caliber dares to speak of stopping when the outcome is determined? How shameless could you be?&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian said with contempt on his face.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not shameless to be weaker than me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, to not dare to fight me head-on because you&rsquo;re weaker than me, and only dare to mount a sneak attack against my back, is someone like you even qualified to criticize me?&rdquo; Chu Feng cast a mocking gaze at Linghu Tiemian.<br>&ldquo;Brat from the Linghu Heavenly Clan, shut your mouth. The truly shameless one is you. If this Queen Mother were you, I would&rsquo;ve already found a hole to hide away in. Yet you actually dare to continue to act in such a manner in this place? Do you need this Queen Mother to teach you a lesson about what shame is?&rdquo; A voice sounded from the sky. It was Queen Mother Fox Immortal.<br>Although Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s despicable behavior caused the crowd to all scoff at him, they only dared to discuss it amongst themselves in private. Very few people would dare to criticize Linghu Tiemian openly. However, the Queen Mother Fox Immortal was not someone to concern herself with such a thing.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s face turned deep red with anger. However, he did not dare to refute her. After all, she was a demoness that dared to do anything. Even he was unwilling to offend her.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, our match has already aroused everyone&rsquo;s attention. Could we begin right away so as to not waste everyone&rsquo;s time?&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei asked.<br>&ldquo;Young master Linghu, I had only responded to you because you spoke to me first. I never had any intention to waste anyone&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, in that case, can we begin now?&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng&rsquo;s words left his mouth, boundless oppressive might burst out from Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s body.<br>At that moment, everyone&rsquo;s gazes turned particularly serious.<br>Linghu Hongfei was a rank two Exalted. Even if Chu Feng was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist and possessed battle power on par with a rank one Exalted, how was he supposed to receive Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s attack?<br>Likely, the outcome of the match would be decided right away.<br>To be exact, the outcome of the match would be decided the moment Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s oppressive might reached Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, another loud explosion was heard.<br>When that explosion rang out, both the stage and the entire earth started to tremble violently.<br>&ldquo;That is?&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed enormously. Even the people of the older generation present were no exception.<br>The reason for that was because eight pillars had suddenly appeared around Linghu Hongfei.<br>Each pillar reached a hundred meters tall, and lightning surged through them, trapping Linghu Hongfei within them.<br>That was a grand formation!!!<br>Most importantly, after that grand formation appeared, Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s oppressive might instantly disappeared.<br>Furthermore, an expression of pain actually appeared on his face.<br></p></div>
