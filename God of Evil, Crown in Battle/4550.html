        <h1>Chapter 4549</h1>
        <div>: Daoist Niantian<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi looked at Chu Feng in gratitude.<br>If she were to follow her heart, she would have had Gu Yang killed as well. However, in view of her mother, it was likely that the choice she would have made in the end was to give Gu Yang a chance.<br>In a sense, Chu Feng had helped her accomplish something that she wanted but couldn&rsquo;t do.<br>With a deep exhalation, she turned to look at her mother.<br>As expected, Gu Mingyuan was deeply conflicted after seeing Gu Yang&rsquo;s death. A rare hint of sorrow surfaced in her usually valiant and determined eyes.<br>Gu Mingyuan was definitely not an indecisive and soft person. On the contrary, she was someone who could toughen her will and make difficult decisions.<br>It was just that Gu Yang carried great weight in her heart. He had supported her through the political shenanigans in the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, and she was deeply grateful to him for it.<br>She could never forget the help he had offered her in her younger years, and that was what put her in a spot.<br>&ldquo;Elder, Gu Yang is a black sheep in the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan. I know that he&rsquo;s a member of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, but Chu Lingxi is also a treasured clan member of our Chu Heavenly Clan. I can&rsquo;t think of a single reason to forgive him after what he had done to Lingxi,&rdquo; Chu Feng told Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re right. Gu Yang deserves to die. Even if you hadn&rsquo;t killed him, our Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan wouldn&rsquo;t have let him off either!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right. Chu Lingxi is also a treasured clan member of our Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan. so it&rsquo;s unforgivable for Gu Yang to try to harm her for his own selfish motives. We would have never let him off easily. He should be lucky that he&rsquo;s getting off so easily!&rdquo;<br>The other elders of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan quickly spoke up in agreement to Chu Feng&rsquo;s judgment.<br>How could they possibly dare to blame Chu Feng for his decision? Had it not been for Chu Feng&rsquo;s intervention, they could have very well lost their lives here!<br>Perhaps out of fear that Chu Feng would feel burdened by this matter, they turned to Gu Mingyuan and asked, &ldquo;Mingyuan, even if you were the one handling this case, I trust that you wouldn&rsquo;t let Gu Yang off either, right?&rdquo;<br>They were hoping for Gu Mingyuan to say something so as to dispel Chu Feng&rsquo;s considerations.<br>Given that things had already been settled, Gu Mingyuan took a deep breath to compose herself once more before she turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s true that I&rsquo;m indebted to Gu Yang for his help in my earlier years, but the heinous deed he has committed this time around is unforgivable. I admit that I would have indeed been unable to kill him, but I don&rsquo;t blame you for doing it either.&rdquo;<br>These were the heartfelt words from Gu Mingyuan. She couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to kill Gu Yang, but she wouldn&rsquo;t blame Chu Feng for doing it either.<br>Deep down, she knew very well that Gu Yang deserved it, and she, too, resented him for trying to sell out her daughter.<br>This incident could be said to be a blessing in disguise for the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan. Not only did they manage to escape from this calamity, but they also obtained generous compensation from the other powers.<br>As such, they felt deeply grateful to Chu Feng, as well as the behemoths who had come here to back Chu Feng up. They quickly prepared a banquet in order to host everyone here.<br>Typically speaking, behemoths like the Dragon Clan would never associate themselves with minor powers like the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan. It was beneath them to do so, and it was viewed as an insult to their reputation.<br>Given so, how could they possibly attend the banquet prepared by the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan?<br>However, out of consideration of Chu Feng, they eventually accepted the offer and attended the banquet. However, what was the most amazing of all was that none of these powerhouses were actually putting on airs.<br>Those from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan would have never imagined that a day would come where they could sit down with those from the Dragon Clan, Monstrous Herd Temple, Yu Heavenly Clan, and Cloudsky Immortal Sect and toast to one another.<br>This was already an unprecedented honor of their Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, worthy of going down in their clan&rsquo;s history.<br>In fact, there were a few who thought that even if they were to drop dead right now, their lives would not have been in vain.<br>One thing that those from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan noticed during the banquet was that the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster, Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, and Cloudsky Immortal Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster were all very respectful to Chu Feng, almost as if they were fawning on him.<br>This made this acutely aware that Chu Feng&rsquo;s current standing was far greater than what they could imagine.<br>After all, these people were already the most powerful and influential individuals in the present Holy Light Galaxy other than the Holy Light Clan.<br>Noticing all of this, Gu Mingyuan and Chu Lingxi couldn&rsquo;t help but look at Chu Feng with a deeply complicated look in their eyes.<br>&ldquo;Lord Mother, it looks like it&rsquo;s no longer possible for me to catch up with Chu Feng&rsquo;s footsteps any more,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi remarked regrettably to her Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;You silly lass. You&rsquo;re already outstanding enough as it is. Why must you compare yourself with Chu Feng? Back then, I was put on the same pedestal as Chu Xuanyuan too, but I knew full well the gap between me and him. I&rsquo;m unable to match him at all,&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan said as she consoled Chu Lingxi.<br>However, Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s little face hardened in indignance as he said, &ldquo;I know that it&rsquo;ll be tough, but I don&rsquo;t intend to give up. I won&rsquo;t allow that fellow to continue calling me &lsquo;little sister&rsquo;. I am the one who should be the big sister here!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this, Gu Mingyuan chuckled to herself before patting Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s head, saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re indeed my daughter. I love your tenacity!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh? What a commotion here!&rdquo;<br>It was at this moment that a voice suddenly sounded from the sky above.<br>Everyone immediately turned their gaze upward, and there were even a few who carried hostility in their eyes.<br>They had already sealed off this place in advance so as to avoid being disturbed, but the person who had just spoken breached the barrier they had put in place to intrude on their gathering.<br>This was a blatant show of disrespect toward the four behemoths!<br>A gray-haired old daoist wearing a blue robe and holding onto a horsetail whisk descended from the sky. Even though the old daoist was standing right before his eyes, Chu Feng was unable to feel the other party&rsquo;s presence at all. There was simply something enigmatic about him.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Niantian.&rdquo;<br>The eyes of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others softened upon seeing upon old daoist, and the hostility on their faces changed into smiles.<br>It was apparent that they recognized this old daoist.<br>&ldquo;What brings the old hermit here today?&rdquo; the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster asked.<br>&ldquo;I, Niantian, wouldn&rsquo;t visit for no reason,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said as he turned his sights to Chu Feng and the other juniors.<br>&ldquo;Since all of our young friends are here, I&rsquo;ll get straight to the point. I&rsquo;ve already activated the Niantian Gambling Formation here in the snowy plains of this Storm Realm, and I&rsquo;d like to invite all of you to have a go at it!&rdquo;<br>As Daoist Niantian spoke, he waved his sleeves, and eight balls of light flew toward Chu Feng, Long Xiaoxiao, Yin Daifen, Fu Feiyue, Yii Hong, Yu Yin, Bao Yue, and Kui Wudi&rsquo;s bodies. The balls of light flew with incredible speeds, only to come to a halt right before the eight of them.<br>It was then that Chu Feng noticed that the ball of light was actually a talisman paper. The talisman paper appeared to store a formation within it, but not even Chu Feng was able to tell what kind of formation it was.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Elder Niantian.&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao and the others thanked Daoist Niantian gratefully as they excitedly accepted the talisman papers.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to stand on ceremony. In fact, I&rsquo;m thankful that you&rsquo;re willing to play along with an old man like me. The Niantian Gambling Formation will be activating very soon. I&rsquo;ll see you there then!&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said before he took his leave.<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others quickly got up from their seats to walk Daoist Niantian away.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, what&rsquo;s the background of this Daoist Niantian?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Long Xiaoxiao as he examined the talisman paper in his hand,<br>Judging from everyone&rsquo;s reaction thus far, it would appear that Niantian was no ordinary person.<br>&ldquo;Little benefactor, you don&rsquo;t know who Daoist Niantian is?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao stared at Chu Feng in shock.<br>&ldquo;Would I ask you if I knew who he is? Stop keeping me in suspense and tell me who he is,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>So, Long Xiaoxiao began to explain Daoist Niantian&rsquo;s background to Chu Feng.<br>As it turned out, Daoist Niantian was one of the elusive experts in the Holy Light Galaxy. He was extremely powerful, such that no one was able to say for certain just how strong he was. Many viewed him as an existence that equaled Old Man Compliance.<br>However, compared to Old Man Compliance, Daoist Niantian was an even more mysterious person. If Old Man Compliance was known for his Ancient Compliance Castle, Daoist Niantian would be known for his Niantian Gambling Formation.<br>As the name suggested, the Niantian Gambling Formation had something to do with gambling. The chips that were used in this gamble was not money but an aura known as the Niantian Energy, which was known to be a cultivation resource.<br>The chips would be distributed by the Niantian Gambling Formation, but not everyone was qualified to obtain them.<br>As it turned out, the talisman papers that were just distributed to Chu Feng and the others were the chips.<br>And what made it all even more so incredible was that the Daoist Niantian actually handed the talisman papers to them in person. In the previous gambles, those who were qualified to have the Daoist Niantian distribute the chips to them in person tended to receive a lion&rsquo;s share of them.<br>To put it simply, Daoist Niantian had just given them a godsent opportunity to raise their cultivation at no cost, and there was a chance that they would walk out of the gamble with huge rewards.<br>This was the first reason why Long Xiaoxiao and the others were so excited about this matter.<br></p></div>
