        <h1>Chapter 4128</h1>
        <div> - Ancient Era&rsquo;s Stone Plate<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fumo Shaoyu sent forth a palm strike. His powerful palm ruthlessly smashed into Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s shoulder.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>The palm strike not only shattered Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s shoulder, it also smashed him into a cliff.<br>&ldquo;Motherfucker! I&rsquo;m going to dismember you into ten thousand pieces!&rdquo;<br>After being struck, Zuoqiu Tiancheng not only did not cower, he instead shouted furiously before soaring into the sky to confront Fumo Shaoyu again.<br>His cultivation had changed. He was no longer a rank two Utmost Exalted, but rather a rank three Utmost Exalted.<br>A Lightning Mark had appeared on his forehead.<br>Furthermore, the Lightning Mark was the character &lsquo;Divine.&rsquo;<br>Just like the rumors had said, Zuoqiu Tiancheng had trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>However, Chu Feng noticed that even though Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s Lightning Mark was also the character &lsquo;Divine,&rsquo; it was somewhat different from his own.<br>The difference was that the lightning from Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s Lightning Mark was not surging ferociously.<br>Furthermore, it seemed like his bloodline aura was also slightly lacking.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. What a bullshit Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan. You actually do not even possess a complete Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. Trash of your caliber actually dares to proclaim yourselves to be a colossus?&rdquo;<br>Just when Chu Feng was feeling confused, Fumo Shaoyu burst into laughter.<br>Once Fumo Shaoyu said those words, Chu Feng came to a sudden realization.<br>It was no wonder Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s Lightning Mark differed from his own.<br>It would appear that what Fumo Shaoyu had said could very well be truth.<br>The reason for the difference could very possibly be because the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique Zuoqiu Tiancheng trained in was incomplete.<br>That said, even though it was incomplete, Chu Feng still had to admit that Zuoqiu Tiancheng had some skills.<br>After all, once one reached the Utmost Exalted realm, one&rsquo;s bloodline abilities would once again be sealed.<br>At the Exalted realm, cultivators were still able to use their bloodline powers and even treasures to increase their cultivations.<br>Many geniuses were even able to use their bloodline power, special techniques and treasures all at once in order to increase their cultivations by three levels.<br>However, once one reached the Utmost Exalted realm, not only would the treasures lose their effectiveness, even their bloodline&rsquo;s power would also be sealed again.<br>Cultivators capable of unsealing their bloodline power at the Utmost Exalted realm were all extremely powerful existences.<br>That said, the power of the seal at the Utmost Exalted realm was extremely strong.<br>Even if someone was able to unseal their bloodline power at the Utmost Exalted realm and increase one&rsquo;s cultivation with it, their battle power would still suffer in the process.<br>Take Gu Mingyuan for example.<br>In the past, Gu Mingyuan had been a genius with fame on par with Chu Feng&rsquo;s father.<br>Perhaps her talent might not have been extremely outstanding when placed in the entire Holy Light Galaxy, however she was most definitely a demon-level genius when placed in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>She also had not failed to live up to her reputation as a genius.<br>She had unsealed her bloodline power at the Utmost Exalted realm, and was able to increase her cultivation using her unsealed bloodline power.<br>However, even though she was able to increase her cultivation, her battle power after had ended up suffering immensely.<br>Yet, it was different for Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>Not only did he increase his cultivation, his battle power was also extremely strong.<br>Even though Fumo Shaoyu and Zuoqiu Tiancheng both possessed rank three Utmost Exalted-level cultivations, Fumo Shaoyu was having some difficulty fighting Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>Although he was having some difficulty, it was not enough that he would be defeated.<br>As such, Chu Feng did not linger anymore. He immediately descended from the sky and undid Fumo Xin&rsquo;er's bonds.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how did you and my big brother find me?&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing Chu Feng, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s expression changed from one of anger to one of beaming happiness.<br>Her current appearance was truly lovely, truly charming.<br>&ldquo;Your big brother has your tracking talisman on him,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking about. I&rsquo;m talking about the fact that I was sucked into that space-time vortex. How did you two still manage to find me? Could it be that you were also sucked into the space-time vortex?&rdquo; asked Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;You are simply too impulsive. You shouldn&rsquo;t have removed your armor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Afraid that something might happen to you, your brother and I immediately removed our armor so that we would also be sucked into a space-time vortex too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, as our space-time vortexes appeared a little later, we did not exit at the same place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fortunately, we landed in the same world, and your brother had your tracking talisman on him. Otherwise we really might not have been able to find you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, it&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;re fine. That guy shouldn&rsquo;t have bullied you, right?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No, he hasn&rsquo;t. Whilst he's definitely a pervert, he lacked the boldness to act on his perverted nature. He didn&rsquo;t dare do anything to me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he truly dared to do anything to me, then, even without the two of you, I would&rsquo;ve made him suffer a miserable death myself,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;You were captured by him, yet you&rsquo;re still boasting?&rdquo; laughed Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Tsk. You don&rsquo;t know exactly how powerful I am,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er raised her chin and refuted.<br>&ldquo;The two of you should stop chatting for a while. Brother Chu Feng, come help me take care of this bastard.&rdquo;<br>Fumo Shaoyu&rsquo;s voice sounded from the sky.<br>&ldquo;Come, both of you come at me together!&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s furious voice was heard soon after.<br>&ldquo;You dare attempt to steal my wife? Both of you can forget about living! I will make sure you suffer miserable deaths!&rdquo;<br>He had become even more furious.<br>Perhaps it was because he had learned of Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu&rsquo;s goal.<br>It could be seen that he was truly fond of Fumo Xin&rsquo;er. As such, he would naturally not allow Fumo Shaoyu and Chu Feng to take her away.<br>However, Chu feng merely smiled at Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s threat. Then, he pointed his finger to the sky.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>As golden light flickered, boundless spirit power soared out from Chu Feng&rsquo;s finger and into the sky.<br>The spirit power turned into a rope and, like a flood dragon soaring out of the sea, it shot straight towards Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>&ldquo;What the hell is this?!&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Tiancheng realized that something was amiss, and tried to avoid the rope.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques were so powerful that not even rank four Utmost Exalteds would be a match for him.<br>As such, Zuoqiu Tiancheng, who had only increased his cultivation to that of a rank three Utmost Exalted, would naturally not be a match either.<br>After the spirit formation rope approached him, it immediately tied him up.<br>&ldquo;Little bastard, let&rsquo;s see you act arrogant again!&rdquo;<br>After Zuoqiu Tiancheng was bound, Fumo Shaoyu, who had originally been at a disadvantage, grabbed Zuoqiu Tiancheng and slapped him in the face.<br>The slap immediately left him with a bloody nose and a swollen face. It had distorted his handsome face considerably.<br>That said, Fumo Shaoyu was not overly ruthless in teaching Zuoqiu Tiancheng a lesson.<br>After several slaps to the face, he tossed Zuoqiu Tiancheng onto the mountain peak.<br>That said, he did not bother to comfort his little sister either. Instead, he turned his gaze onto the palace.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, did you see that?&rdquo;<br>Fumo Shaoyu pointed deep at the group of palaces located on the mountain peak.<br>What he pointed at was a stone plate.<br>That stone plate seemed like a seat, yet was not a seat.<br>Mysterious runes and symbols filled the stone plate. Furthermore, it was suffused with an Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura.<br>From a glance, one could tell that it was extraordinary.<br></p></div>
