        <h1>Chapter 3866</h1>
        <div> - Extremely Strange<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The mural seemed to portray a person Chu Feng knew, his friend.<br>If the mural was truly that of Chu Feng&rsquo;s friend, this would be no small matter.<br>That was the reason why Chu Feng felt so stunned.<br>However, Chu Feng soon rejected this train of thought.<br>Although the mural did resemble someone he knew, it only resembled them, and was not completely the same.<br>The reason for that was because the person portrayed on the mural appeared rather strange. It seemed more like a monstrous being wanting to become a human, yet failing to transform completely.<br>Although the person on the portrait had a human appearance and a human form, it still kept the characteristics of a monster.<br>Even the outfit of that person was very strange. That was not the attire of a human.<br>Most importantly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s friend was someone from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.<br>It would be impossible for that person to have appeared there.<br>After all, this place was the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>This place had been sealed for tens of thousands of years.<br>Over those tens of thousands of years, no one had been able to set foot into it<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s friend had a similar age to his own, and was also a person of the younger generation...<br>Because of all this, Chu Feng felt that he was overthinking things.<br>&ldquo;This place is too strange.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, there are definitely other creatures here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In a situation where we are unable to determine its cultivation, we must act very carefully.&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Just in case, let&rsquo;s all conceal ourselves.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With me as the center and you all as assistants, we will use our power to set up a spirit formation that can conceal all of us.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he released his spirit power.<br>His spirit power was like a web with countless links.<br>Seeing this, the eleven Mystic Cave Saints also all released their own spirit power to cooperate with him.<br>Soon, the web landed on the twelve of them.<br>Like clothes, they covered their bodies. Even their eyes were covered.<br>&ldquo;Activate!!!&rdquo;<br>Following a shout from Chu Feng, the web disappeared. Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints also disappeared.<br>Of course, they did not truly disappear. Rather, they had concealed themselves with the spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Wow! Brother Asura, this spirit formation of yours is truly powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only did your spirit formation conceal us, but we are even able to communicate through the spirit formation using voice transmissions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With this, no matter how powerful someone might be, they will not be able to hear our voice transmissions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boy, you&rsquo;re so young, yet you possess such extraordinary spirit formations. Remarkable. Truly remarkable.&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints looked to the concealment formation covering them and praised Chu Feng nonstop.<br>&ldquo;While brother Asura&rsquo;s spirit formation is truly mystical, it requires a great amount of spirit power and sufficient skills. Neither one is dispensable. Thus, brother Asura is truly a genius.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You all should now know why I insisted on having brother Asura join us?&rdquo;<br>The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints spoke proudly.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve long known that. Brother Asura&rsquo;s spirit techniques are truly superior to our own. We are in deep admiration, deep admiration.&rdquo; the others of the Mystic Cave Saints echoed.<br>&ldquo;Enough with the flattery. We&rsquo;ve known each other for so long, and already know one another very well.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let us seize this opportunity to quickly examine things. However, we must be extremely careful. Although you all are concealed with the spirit formation, you cannot journey too far away.&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Very well. We will do as brother Asura arranges.&rdquo; the Mystic Cave Saints answered in succession.<br>Then, like before, they split in two and proceeded in either direction of the cave.<br>In the blink of an eye, they had examined an area over ten thousand meters across. Yet, they still saw no end in either direction.<br>However, due to the spirit formation, they could not move too far away from one another, and had to make a decision. The twelve of them must proceed in a single direction.<br>Thus, they gathered and began to discuss which direction to take.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, it would appear that our map is fake.&rdquo; said the Eleventh after they gathered together.<br>&ldquo;Fuck. But that shouldn&rsquo;t be the case. This map&hellip; shouldn&rsquo;t be fake.&rdquo; The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints mumbled to himself. Displeasure filled his tone. At the same time, there was a slight amount of doubt in his voice.<br>Although they had only surveyed ten thousand meters, they discovered that there was simply no such cave path when they compared their observations to the map.<br>Because of that, they felt that the map might be fake.<br>&ldquo;The map might not be completely accurate. It is normal for it to be different.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since we&rsquo;re already in here, let&rsquo;s not overthink things. Even without the map, we must still carefully investigate things. After all, we couldn&rsquo;t possibly waste this decisive opportunity, no?&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What brother Asura said is correct. As matters stand, we cannot afford to waste time. We must grasp this opportunity firmly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that we will have no choice but to use it to survey things.&rdquo;<br>As the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints spoke, he glanced at his other ten brothers.<br>The ten Mystic Cave Saints nodded. They seemed to have reached a mutual understanding.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, blood splattered all over, and a muffled sound was heard. It was the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints. He had pierced his dantian with his own hand.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was shocked to see this scene.<br>Chu Feng knew very well how important one&rsquo;s dantian was. After all, that was the place where one&rsquo;s cultivation was contained.<br>Once one&rsquo;s dantian was damaged, one&rsquo;s cultivation would also be damaged.<br>Chu Feng was unable to understand why the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints decided to do this.<br>&ldquo;Puu, puu, puu, puu, puu~~~&rdquo;<br>At the moment when Chu Feng was confused, ten more muffled sounds were heard.<br>The remainder of the Mystic Cave Saints also pierced their dantians with their own hands like their eldest brother.<br>&ldquo;You all&hellip; what are you doing?&rdquo;<br>Even Chu Feng started to panic slightly.<br>After all, they were companions at the moment. Chu Feng did not wish for anything to happen to them.<br>However, after a short moment of panic, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>He discovered that while it was true that the Mystic Cave Saints had pierced their dantians with their own hands, the blood was real, and their souls being split open was also real, their cultivations were, surprisingly, undamaged.<br>Furthermore, the Mystic Cave Saints showed no sign of pain. In fact, it even seemed like their split-open souls were also undamaged.<br>This was simply unreasonable.<br>&ldquo;What is going on with these guys?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng felt that the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb was not the only thing that was strange.<br>The Mystic Cave Saints were also extremely strange.<br></p></div>
