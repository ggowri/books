        <h1>Chapter 3591</h1>
        <div> - Owing A Life<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though the Sacred Tree Throne had already cracked, Chu Feng was still sitting on it. That said, there was an additional item in his hand. It was a crimson sword.<br>Chu Feng showed no trace of fear even though he was facing the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Instead, he appeared extremely relaxed.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, our alliance still stands. However, there is no alliance between myself and this bunch of trash,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Since we are allies, do my words hold weight?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;In that case, continue with our peaceful coexistence. At the very least, do not unleash a massacre here&hellip;&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, have you forgotten how this bunch of trash treated you earlier?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If they are allowed to leave safely, it will definitely not be a good thing for your Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With their despicable nature, they will definitely retaliate against your Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;I will settle that matter with them myself. That is something completely unrelated. Since I am the person who brought them here, I naturally should bring them out,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Truly foolish.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, since you&rsquo;ve made the request, I will give you face.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, this old man can seek them out for revenge at any time.&rdquo;<br>After the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief finished saying those words, he retrieved his oppressive might. Then, he said to the crowd, &ldquo;Trash, listen carefully. From today on, you all owe young friend Chu Feng a life. It is he who has saved you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thank you, young master Chu Feng, thank you, young master Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>The crowd all began to express their thanks to Chu Feng.<br>Ignoring all other matters, they were, at least, thanking Chu Feng with sincerity.<br>They were all able to tell that the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s killing intent earlier was not a lie. He was truly planning to kill them.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for Chu Feng speaking out for them and stopping him, they would&rsquo;ve most definitely died. None of them would be able to live. Not even Tantai Yinjian would be an exception.<br>Chu Feng did not bother to pay attention to the crowd thanking him. Instead, he clasped his fist at the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, &ldquo;Thank you, senior, for giving me face.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, he put away the Evil God Sword.<br>&ldquo;Why were you holding that lousy sword?&rdquo;<br>Zhang Shirui jumped over to Chu Feng and asked with a curious expression on her face.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of your business,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Tsk&hellip;&rdquo; Zhang Shirui cast a look of contempt at Chu Feng. However, she did not inquire further into the matter.<br>Actually, many people noticed the Evil God Sword Chu Feng held in his hand.<br>However, no one bothered to pay attention to it. At the very most, they would only become slightly, and only slightly, curious, like Zhang Shirui.<br>It was instead the undead man who was observing this from the shadows through the surface of the lake that was more curious...<br>&ldquo;Do you know about your brother&rsquo;s sword?&rdquo; he asked.<br>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Wang Qiang asked.<br>&ldquo;That sword is rather extraordinary,&rdquo; said the undead man.<br>&ldquo;Since y-you were able to tell, t-th-then-then this young m-master shall be m-mer-merciful and tell you about it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My brother&rsquo;s sword is called the Evil God S-s-sword. It is s-so powerful t-that, tsk tsk, it c-can e-eliminate even you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;T-thus, old fart, w-while you dare to be impolite against t-this young ma-master, I&rsquo;d urge you to watch your manners t-toward my brother. Even t-though his cultivation is f-far inferior to yours, his abilities w-will fill y-you with r-regret,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;That amazing? This old man is truly scared,&rdquo; the undead man pretended to be scared.<br>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;ve al-already warned you. D-don&rsquo;t come c-crying to me l-later,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Very well. After hearing that from you, I&rsquo;m even more impatient to experience the capabilities of that brother of yours.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since the Sacred Palace Hall is about to close, go ahead and summon them here,&rdquo; the undead man said.<br>&ldquo;Y-you w-want them to come here?&rdquo; asked Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Of course. You&rsquo;re going to meet your brother soon, are you not feeling very happy?&rdquo; the undead man asked.<br>&ldquo;O-of course,&rdquo; Wang Qiang smiled uglily.<br>Although Wang Qiang was smiling happily, he was actually panicking in his heart.<br>Having interacted with the undead man for so long, Wang Qiang had gained an understanding of him.<br>The undead man was someone who had existed since the Ancient Era.<br>He possessed an enormous amount of power. He was so powerful that his strength was simply inestimable. He was the most powerful existence Wang Qiang had ever met. At the same time, he was also the most terrifying existence.<br>Furthermore, although he was laughing and joking around with Wang Qiang, he knew that the undead man was extremely dangerous.<br>Because of that, deep in Wang Qiang&rsquo;s heart, he did not wish for Chu Feng to stand before him.<br>However, Wang Qiang also knew that what would happen afterwards was something that he could not control.<br>Thus, he did not know if it was a blessing or a calamity for Chu Feng to appear there.<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>The trembling of the palace hall grew even more intense.<br>Cracks began to appear on the walls.<br>Everyone was able to tell that it was on the verge of collapse.<br>&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s up. We will all be leaving this place,&rdquo; said the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Hearing those words, the crowd became extremely joyous. They were all hoping to leave that place right away.<br>After all, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, an extremely terrifying existence, was there. They could lose their lives at any moment. There was nothing safer than quickly leaving that place.<br>&ldquo;Not everyone will be leaving this place. Only those that are weak will be leaving this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You trash that cared only about your own self-interest are destined to be unable to meet Lord Qin Kunlun, unable to obtain true power,&rdquo; the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean by that? Are you implying that Lord Qin Kunlun is truly still alive? That he is the one who set up the barriers as a trial for us?&rdquo; A daring and curious individual asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already said that from the very beginning. Do I have to reemphasize myself?&rdquo; the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The crowd felt even more complicated upon hearing those words.<br>Originally, they had thought that the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was joking with them. They simply did not believe that Qin Kunlun was still alive.<br>However, as matters stood, they started to believe it slightly.<br>It was precisely because they started to believe it slightly that they felt unreconciled.<br>Qin Kunlun was still alive, and had set up multiple trials...<br>In that case, if one was able to undergo the final trial, then that person could very likely receive Qin Kunlun&rsquo;s inheritance.<br>That said, it was very clear that they were all people that had failed the trial.<br>That was the reason why they felt so unreconciled.<br></p></div>
