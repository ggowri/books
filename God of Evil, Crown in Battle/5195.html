        <div>: Surmounting Four Cultivation Ranks!!!<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Why does he look so familiar?&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, Chu Feng found the terrified expression of that man particularly familiar, but he didn&rsquo;t think too much into it. After all, there were bound to be many people who looked similar to each other in this vast world of cultivation.<br>The spectators also tried to leave the area, but Chu Feng raised his hand and exerted a powerful suction force.<br>&ldquo;You may leave, but you&rsquo;ll have to pay for the show.&rdquo;<br>The spectators&rsquo; blue rocks and Cosmos Sacks flew straight toward Chu Feng, but none of them dared to utter a word of complaint at all. After witnessing Chu Feng&rsquo;s savagery, they were more than thankful to be able to escape with their lives.<br>In contrast, Chu Feng was disappointed with his gains. None of these juniors had anything good in their Cosmos Sack, which was to be expected considering their low cultivation. There were also only fifteen blue rocks out of the hundreds of spectators.<br>After the spectators fled the scene, the only ones left were Chu Feng and the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen.<br>&ldquo;How dare you cripple my cultivation? I&rsquo;ll make sure you die a horrible death! I&rsquo;ll have your entire clan executed!&rdquo; the strongest junior of the Situ World Spiritist Clan bellowed.<br>Even with his cultivation crippled and his life threatened, the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen would still habitually utter vicious words. In fact, if he had a chance, he wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to carry out such acts.<br>His behavior showed that he had little regard for people&rsquo;s life. He likely had a lot of blood on his hands.<br>Thus, Chu Feng formed a huge hand made out of spirit power and thrust it downward.<br>Pu!<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansman was crushed into bits, and his blood splattered all over his fellow clansmen.<br>There were other Situ World Spiritist Clansmen who had been glaring at Chu Feng earlier, but witnessing the death of their fellow brethren shocked them. Fear filled their minds as they realized that they were going to die.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill me! Don&rsquo;t kill me! I&rsquo;m begging you. I only came here under his orders. I wasn&rsquo;t planning on doing anything to you at all! It&rsquo;s all his orders! If anyone deserves to die, it&rsquo;s him! I&rsquo;m innocent!&rdquo;<br>One of the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen begged Chu Feng, even going to the extent of pinning the blame to his dead brethren.<br>This was what these people were like. Their tough front was nothing but an act. As soon as they encounter someone who was even tougher than them, they would turn back into cowards.<br>Chu Feng knew that they were lying through their teeth, for he had clearly seen how they had acted up to this point. However, he didn&rsquo;t have any intention to kill them.<br>If that Situ World Spiritist Clansman hadn&rsquo;t threatened him, he wouldn&rsquo;t have killed him either.<br>There were two considerations behind why he didn&rsquo;t outright kill these juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>One, he wanted to keep them alive so that they would exact vengeance on that rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist who had just run away.<br>Two, he didn&rsquo;t want to move around in the shadows anymore. He wanted to confront the Situ World Spiritist Clan head-on. He wanted to let them know that he was after their lives. More and more of their clansmen would lose their lives because of him.<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clan would surely make light of him at the start. After all, he was merely a junior with no background. However, as more and more of their clansmen die to his hands, they would be forced to reassess their evaluation of him. They would start to fear him.<br>He wanted to see all of them suffering a mental breakdown before finally being confronted with death.<br>That was his way of vengeance.<br>&ldquo;Remember, my name is Chu Feng. I only crippled you today because you&rsquo;re from the Situ World Spiritist Clan. However, you should be glad that you managed to escape with your lives&mdash;the others that come after you won&rsquo;t be as lucky. Make sure to convey my words back to your clan. If you wish to live, I suggest you leave the Situ World Spiritist Clan as soon as possible, or else&hellip; You know the consequences.&rdquo;<br>With a wave of his sleeves, Chu Feng took away the Cosmos Sacks, treasures, and blue rocks from the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen. There were around two hundred blue rocks amongst them, likely obtained from robbing others.<br>Following that incident, Chu Feng continued to advance through the cavern searching for blue rocks. He wasn&rsquo;t worried about anyone exacting vengeance on him since he didn&rsquo;t think that there were any juniors here who could fight him.<br>Just as Chu Feng acquired another blue rock, the cavern suddenly started trembling.<br>Boom!<br>Tremors rattled the cavern, and it didn&rsquo;t look like it would stop anytime soon. Cracks started appearing along the walls, looking as if the cavern was on the verge of collapsing on itself.<br>The blue rocks around Chu Feng started combining together to form a massive blue rock.<br>&ldquo;Did I trigger the tremors?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng realized that the tremors might have been related to the blue rocks. He was initially perplexed as to what was going on, but upon doing a quick calculation, he realized that he had managed to amass exactly a thousand blue rocks.<br>It could be that the key to advancing in this trial was to obtain a thousand blue rocks.<br>As the blue rocks combined together, a tattered formation map appeared before his eyes. He could tell right away that it was a formation deciphering method.<br>A few moments later, the massive blue rock started shrinking until it was no more than the size of a pearl. Judging from the unique shape of the blue rock and the spirit power harnessed within it, Chu Feng deduced that it was a key.<br>Shoosh!<br>Chu Feng was just about to take a closer look at it when the blue rock suddenly flew into another person&rsquo;s hands. Unbeknownst to him, another person was already standing in front of him.<br>It was a ravishing woman whose beauty stood out even in this dimly-lit cavern.<br>&ldquo;Xue Ji?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was surprised.<br>&ldquo;Are you surprised to see me?&rdquo;<br>Xue Ji narrowed her eyes at Chu Feng seductively, but she soon turned her attention to the key-shaped rock in her hand.<br>&ldquo;Not bad. You&rsquo;re as competent as always. It would have been hard for me to acquire this if not for you,&rdquo; Xue Ji said.<br>&ldquo;How did you get in here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I be able to enter this place? I might be older than you, but I&rsquo;m not that old,&rdquo; Xue Ji replied.<br>&ldquo;You were following me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Xue Ji was a world spirit, after all. Even if she was able to utilize world spiritist techniques through special means, her proficiency was bound to be far below that of Chu Feng. It would have been hard for her to collect the blue rocks on her own.<br>After all, only a real world spiritist could bring out the true prowess of world spiritist techniques.<br>It was more likely that Xue Ji had been following Chu Feng right from the start, waiting for him to succeed so that she could reap the fruits of his efforts.<br>&ldquo;Xue Ji, I advise you to return it to me right now. I don&rsquo;t want to fight you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Hoh. You&rsquo;re as confident as ever. Try and take it from me then. If you manage to get it back, I&rsquo;ll acknowledge you as my master once more,&rdquo; Xue Ji said provocatively as she fiddled with the blue rock.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame me for this.&rdquo;<br>Shoosh!<br>Chu Feng manifested his spirit power into two massive hands that grasped at Xue Ji. He had no intention of hurting Xue Ji&mdash;he only wanted to take the blue rock back. Its key-like shape made it apparent that it would be of use later on.<br>Xue Ji stood still on the spot, allowing Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power hands to approach her.<br>Weng!<br>Those spirit power hands came to an abrupt halt just half a meter away from Xue Ji. It was not Chu Feng who had stopped them but an invisible barrier blocking them off.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Out of strength? Or are your hands not long enough?&rdquo; Xue Ji asked.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; are actually able to surmount four cultivation ranks?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked at Xue Ji in astonishment.<br>Xue Ji&rsquo;s cultivation was only at rank seven Martial Exalted level, making her weaker than Chu Feng. On top of that, Chu Feng&rsquo;s rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation spirit power was further buffed by his world spiritist bloodline and the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, making him two ranks stronger than ordinary rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivators.<br>Yet, despite Chu Feng&rsquo;s supposed superior strength, he was unable to overcome Xue Ji&rsquo;s martial power barrier. The fact that she was able to block Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack despite being only at rank seven Martial Exalted level meant that she had the terrifying power to surmount four cultivation ranks!<br>Even Eggy was only able to surmount two cultivation ranks when she first entered Martial Exalted level.<br>&ldquo;Do you know how powerful I am now? Does it upset you to lose me?&rdquo; Xue Ji said with a provocative smile.<br></p></div>
