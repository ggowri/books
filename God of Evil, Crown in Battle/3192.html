        <h1>Chapter 3191</h1>
        <div> - Battle Between Kin<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Chu Feng, are you truly willing to help me kill Bai Liluo?" The black silhouette asked.<br>"Of course," Chu Feng answered.<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re willing to help me, then extend your hand and do not resist,&rdquo; the black silhouette said.<br>Chu Feng grew hesitant upon hearing those words. He had no idea what the black silhouette planned to do to him.<br>However, Chu Feng did not reveal his hesitation, and quickly extended his hand toward the black silhouette.<br>&ldquo;You must try to endure it. It might be a bit painful,&rdquo; the black silhouette said.<br>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Chu Feng immediately nodded.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, that black silhouette moved. He actually turned into gaseous flames and bored into Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm. At that moment, Chu Feng was able to feel a vast yet strange power condensing within his palm.<br>When that power was condensed, Chu Fent felt unbearable pain. In order to alleviate the pain, Chu Feng relied on his spirit power. However, even though he had alleviated the pain, the waves of concentrated pain were still there. The pain originated from his palm and extended through his entire body. It was so painful that Chu Feng began to feel dizzy, and nearly fainted.<br>Fortunately, after an hour passed, the black silhouette flew out of Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm and once again took a humanoid form. Chu Feng looked at his palm and discovered that a special symbol had appeared there.<br>The symbol was that of a spear. Chu Feng was able to tell that the spear symbol possessed enormous destructive power. Furthermore, its destructive power was of a very targeted nature.<br>&ldquo;No wonder Bai Liluo chose you. You are actually able to withstand my Source-power Soulspear. You are indeed remarkable,&rdquo; the black silhouette said to Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng realized that the power inside his palm was not something that ordinary people could withstand. Furthermore, obtaining that power should pose some danger to one&rsquo;s life.<br>&ldquo;Using this spear, you&rsquo;ll be able to kill Bai Liluo. However, you can only use it once. Thus&hellip; you&rsquo;ll only have one opportunity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When we encounter Bai Liluo later, I&rsquo;ll fight her first. Due to the fact that we are one, she will no longer be able to move once I restrict her. At that time, you can attack her as you wish, and she won&rsquo;t be able to fight back.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, you merely need to pierce her heart with your palm, and she will undoubtedly die,&rdquo; the black silhouette said.<br>&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, the black silhouette turned into a black whirlwind and enveloped Chu Feng within it. With a loud &lsquo;bang,&rsquo; the soil began to fly into the sky, and the black silhouette had submerged itself into the depths of the underground with Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng and the black silhouette had merely descended into the earth for a short period of time before they arrived at an underground palace.<br>The arrangement of that underground palace greatly resembled that Iceseal Forbidden Area.<br>However, that place was not dark, and did not have those sealed monsters.<br>&ldquo;Continue onward and you&rsquo;ll be able to find Bai Liluo. Do not be afraid. With me here, she won&rsquo;t be able to harm you.&rdquo;<br>The black silhouette&rsquo;s voice was heard again. Merely, his silhouette was nowhere to be seen. He had concealed himself.<br>Chu Feng did not hesitate, and proceeded according to the black silhouette&rsquo;s instructions. Chu Feng only walked for a short period of time before he saw many spirit formations. The formation cores of those spirit formations were all natural oddities.<br>Those natural oddities all had signs of life, and resembled fetuses. Although they did not have awareness, they were already alive.<br>As for Bai Liluo, she was sitting in the center of the various spirit formations. Her eyes were tightly closed, her hands were forming hand seals, and her body was encircled with light. A special sort of attractive power enveloped her body. Before that attractive power, a power visible to the naked eye was being extracted from the natural oddities and flooding into Bai Liluo.<br>Bai Liluo was refining those natural oddities.<br>Natural oddities were cultivation resources to begin with. Chu Feng had refined natural oddities multiple times in the past. In a world of martial cultivators, refining natural oddities was a very normal thing to do.<br>However, after hearing what that black silhouette said, after learning that Bai Liluo herself was a natural oddity, and witnessing her refining those other natural oddities, an act of killing one&rsquo;s kin, Chu Feng inevitably started to believe what the black silhouette said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, why are you here?&rdquo;<br>Bai Liluo suddenly opened her eyes when Chu Feng approached. She was very surprised to see him.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him? He was the one that brought you here?&rdquo;<br>However, Bai Liluo soon responded to her own question. She already knew how Chu Feng had arrived at that place. Sure enough, she knew that black silhouette.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s your little brother that brought me here,&rdquo; Chu Feng did not deny it.<br>Hearing those words, Bai Liluo&rsquo;s expression changed. She did not plan to refute Chu Feng&rsquo;s claim about her so-called &lsquo;little brother.&rsquo; From this, it could be seen that the black silhouette did not lie when he claimed to be Bai Liluo&rsquo;s little brother.<br>&ldquo;So your little brother didn&rsquo;t lie to me? That dead woman inside the tomb and the villagers that have lost their minds, it&rsquo;s all caused by you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct,&rdquo; Bai Liluo nodded.<br>&ldquo;Why did you do that? Is it really for strength?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It was I who brought harm upon them, I who devoured their souls. However, that is not what I desired. At that time, I lost control of myself, and had no idea what was happening,&rdquo; Bai Liluo became a bit emotional. Deep amounts of remorse and grief filled her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Lost control?&rdquo;<br>Right after Bai Liluo&rsquo;s words left her mouth, that black silhouette&rsquo;s voice was heard. At the same time, the black silhouette also revealed himself. He stood beside Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What &lsquo;lost control.&rsquo; You said that you&rsquo;d lost control back then, then why are you still killing our kin right now?&rdquo; The black silhouette pointed at Bai Liluo.<br>&ldquo;Little brother, you should know very well that there are good natural oddities and evil natural oddities. If the natural oddities that I am refining are to awaken, they will willfully slaughter the innocent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for me, I am training with their power. I have only absorbed their power to stop them from awakening, and am not killing them. What wrong is there?&rdquo; Bai Liluo said.<br>&ldquo;You speak as if you&rsquo;re righteous. However, how are you to determine whether they&rsquo;re evil or not?&rdquo; The black silhouette asked.<br>&ldquo;I can determine their nature. You should know that very well,&rdquo; Bai Liluo said.<br>&ldquo;Even if you&rsquo;re capable of it, what about big sister Liluo and our other relatives? Were they evil?&rdquo; The black silhouette pointed at Bai Liluo and spoke angrily.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Liluo didn&rsquo;t know how to answer him. At the same time, she revealed a painful expression.<br>&ldquo;Today, I will avenge big sister Liluo and our relatives!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the black silhouette moved. Like a sharp black sword, he shot straight toward Bai Liluo.<br>Faced with the incoming black silhouette, Bai Liluo did not attempt to dodge. Just like that, the black silhouette and Bai Liluo fused into one.<br></p></div>
