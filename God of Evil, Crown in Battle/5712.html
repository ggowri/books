        <h1>Chapter 5712: The Cunning Taishi Xingzhong</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was taken aback. None of them had expected Chu Feng to suddenly make a move. It was Taishi Xingzhong&rsquo;s son they were talking about here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders, including the one-eyed elder, were caught off guard. They had thought that Chu Feng was a pushover. Who could have thought that he would do something this bold?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re courting death!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one-eyed elder snapped out of his daze and quickly constructed a formation. The formation emanated a strong murderous aura, signaling his intent to kill Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weng!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a burst of light, and the one-eyed elder and the others froze in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light had originated from Chu Feng, but it was linked to Taishi Xingzhong&rsquo;s son. Chu Feng had constructed a soul link formation between him and Taishi Xingzhong&rsquo;s son. If he died, Taishi Xingzhong&rsquo;s son would die as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that Chu Feng had used the earlier punch to inject the formation into the soul of Taishi Xingzhong&rsquo;s son!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Who in the world are you?&rdquo; the one-eyed elder asked. It only dawned upon him now that this junior had come prepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Call Taishi Xingzhong here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the one-eyed elder asked once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uwa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng tightened his grip, and Taishi Xingzhong&rsquo;s son screamed in agony. The latter was unable to withstand Chu Feng&rsquo;s torture with his frail body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Stop! Don&rsquo;t hurt him!&rdquo; the one-eyed elder cried in panic, as he realized that he was unable to intimidate the junior before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do it right now. I don&rsquo;t have the patience to play with you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; The one-eyed elder gestured to one of the elders, and the elder immediately did as he was told. Then, he turned back to Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Young friend, why are you doing this?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chu Feng paid him no heed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This brother over here, what are you doing? You&rsquo;ll implicate us as well!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of the junior world spiritists anxiously sent Chu Feng voice messages to dissuade him, but even so, they dared not to say it aloud out of fear of angering the elders. Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to respond to these fools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, an elder with snowy-white eyebrows that reached his shoulder and a beard that flowed down to his knees appeared. He had an upright stature despite his old age, standing at over two meters tall, and he felt imposing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite appearing like a kind old man, he was definitely not a good person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was none other than Taishi Xingzhong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Save me, father!&rdquo; Taishi Xingzhong&rsquo;s frail son spoke up weakly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Taishi Xingzhong&rsquo;s expression didn&rsquo;t falter in the least. He had been </span><span>through enough storms to remain calm even when someone held his son hostage against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Taishi Xingzhong asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Honestly answer my question if you don&rsquo;t want your son to die,&rdquo; Chu Feng demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Shoot off.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are Long Chengyu and the others still alive?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, they are. The current clan chief is a kind man. Long Chengyu, Long Muxi, and their father are alive and living comfortably.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words induced a laugh from Taishi Xingzhong, as he said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, why don&rsquo;t you reveal your true face?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders and the junior world spiritists were taken aback. There was no one in the world of cultivation who hadn&rsquo;t heard of him. Could it really be the same Chu Feng who wreaked havoc in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s son?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re good at guessing.&rdquo; Chu Feng was impressed by Taishi Xingzhong&rsquo;s deduction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taishi Xingzhong was formidable, but he shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to see through Chu Feng&rsquo;s disguise. He must have deduced it from their interaction. This showed that he was a smart man. Thus, Chu Feng removed his disguise formation and revealed his true face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&hellip; really is Chu Feng?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The junior world spiritists quickly backed away in fear. The elders looked at him warily, including the one-eyed elder. His reputation was resounding. He was someone who was still alive and kicking despite having wreaked havoc in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, he possessed the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline, and the phenomenon he had created that day was shocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Incredible. You&rsquo;re alive,&rdquo; Taishi Xingzhong remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll still be alive even after you&rsquo;re dead,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Taishi Xingzhong chuckled, not affected by Chu Feng&rsquo;s insult. &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll bring you to Long Chengyu and the others if you free my son.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Will I still be able to live after freeing your son?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good point.&rdquo; Taishi Xingzhong nodded in agreement, but a vicious glint flashed across his eyes as he continued, &ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t be able to live even if you refuse to free my son.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his hand and directed it toward Chu Feng, releasing a powerful surge of spirit power that manifested into a domineering formation around the palace. This palace was complicated, binding everyone present in place while sealing off all teleportation energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taishi Xingzhong was a formidable world spiritist, having reached late True Dragon level. He was even stronger than the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Saint-tier elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, he was extremely smart. He had been secretly constructing a formation, and his earlier conversation with Chu Feng was merely an attempt to stall time. That was why he could unleash such a powerful and impeccable formation within the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of saving his son, Taishi Xingzhong approached Chu Feng as he said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re bold to dare mess with me, Chu Feng.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I dare to even wreak havoc in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. What do you, Taishi Xingzhong, count as?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That makes sense,&rdquo; Taishi Xingzhong replied with a nod. &ldquo;Did you meet my wretched disciple?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of answering that question, Chu Feng asked, &ldquo;So, how is it? You have been examining the formation for a long time now.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of panic finally flashed across Taishi Xingzhong&rsquo;s composed face. Chu Feng had seen through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not that he didn&rsquo;t want to save his son, but that Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation was so strong that he dared not to make a reckless move despite having bound Chu Feng in place. He was only entertaining Chu Feng to buy time for him to figure out an opening in Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could have known that Chu Feng would see through him?</span></p></div>
