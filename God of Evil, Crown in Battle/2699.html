        <h1>Chapter 2698</h1>
        <div> - Brought Together By Fate<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>These people were all members of the younger generation. They all possessed decent appearances, and were wearing gorgeous outfits.<br>Their level of cultivation were also very decent. This was especially true for the man leading the group. He was actually&hellip; a rank four True Immortal.<br>As for the others, they were mostly True Immortals too. The majority of them were rank one True Immortals. However, there were also a couple of them who were not True Immortals, but rather peak Martial Ancestors.<br>Although the overall cultivation of those people were all very strong, and they were all members of the younger generation, their ages were much older than Chu Feng.<br>Through his observation, Chu Feng discovered that while those people were all members of the younger generation who were less than a hundred years old, they were approaching a hundred years old.<br>Of course, martial cultivators possessed lifespans capable of reaching several thousand years, if not over ten thousand years. Thus, an age in the nineties could be said to be fairly young for martial cultivators.<br>Although they were older than Chu Feng, they would be considered to be extremely young people in the world of martial cultivation.<br>By comparison, their ages could simply be said to be akin to children who had barely trained in martial cultivation.<br>When the crowd managed to see those young men and women clearly, they immediately moved aside and created a road for the incoming group of people.<br>That was not all. Chu Feng also noticed that practically everyone present revealed expressions of shock and fear.<br>In fact, there were many people that did not dare to look at that group of people again. When that group arrived, they all lowered their heads.<br>The reason for that was because the group of men and women were all wearing an identical title plate on their waist.<br>Chu Heavenly Clan!!!<br>Those young men and women were all from the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Yoh, those brats from the Chu Heavenly Clan are truly showing a grand disposition of forces here.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Her Lady Queen curled her lips. An expression of disgust emerged in her eyes.<br>The reason for that was because she knew very well that if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that those people belonged to the Chu Heavenly Clan, they would simply not be able to make the people present fear them like they did, merely the cultivation they possessed.<br>The man leading the group passed through the crowd. He raised his head and clasped his fist as he spoke facing upward.<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Xianshou of the Chu Heavenly Clan, have heard that the Holy Daughter is training here. Might it be possible for me to obtain the honor of chatting with the Holy Daughter?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s actually the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s young masters and young ladies. Our Holy Daughter has already given word to invite young masters and young ladies up for a chat,&rdquo; said one of the Starfall Eight Immortals at the peak of the mountain.<br>His voice was very powerful and penetrating.<br>However, that was reasonable too. According to Chu Feng&rsquo;s observation, he discovered that the invisible spirit formation was not only capable of preventing others from approaching, but it was also capable of isolating sound.<br>In other words, the old man from the Starfall Holy Land must be using special methods to allow others to hear his voice.<br>Upon hearing what the old man said, that Chu Xianshuo revealed a proud smile. Then, he led the other Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation and flew up to the summit of the mountain peak.<br>Due to the fact that they were given permission, they were not blocked by the invisible spirit formation and successfully entered the mountain peak.<br>At that moment, the people below were all extremely envious. This was especially true for the men. They were openly revealing their envy.<br>&ldquo;In the end, they&rsquo;re people from the Chu Heavenly Clan. Even the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter will have to give them face.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was able to hear what they were saying. Everyone was feeling great envy toward the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s young masters and young ladies.<br>&ldquo;Based on what&rsquo;s being said, is it very difficult for one to see the Holy Daughter?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Difficult, extremely difficult. Reportedly, many demon-level geniuses wanted to see the Holy Daughter. However, they were all refused,&rdquo; Song Xi said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? In that case, this Holy Daughter is quite a proud character,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>Then, Chu Feng looked toward the summit of the mountain peak. He then said to Song Xi, &ldquo;It seems that those people from the Chu Heavenly Clan were also refused.&rdquo;<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng saw that while the young masters and young ladies from the Chu Heavenly Clan managed to reach the summit of the mountain peak, they were unable to enter the palace.<br>Even though that invisible spirit formation had isolated all sound, Chu Feng was able to determine what they were saying by reading their lips.<br>The people from the Chu Heavenly Clan were only able to converse with the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter from outside the palace. Even they were refused entry into the palace.<br>This sort of situation was something that the young masters and young ladies from the Chu Heavenly Clan did not expect. Thus, their current expressions were quite ugly.<br>This was especially true for that man called Chu Xianshuo.<br>However, perhaps it was due to the strength of the Starfall Eight Immortals, but the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan did not speak rudely. They could only silently accept the restriction.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve actually really been refused,&rdquo; After hearing what Chu Feng said, Song Xi also noticed what was happening and felt extremely shocked.<br>&ldquo;Haha. This Holy Daughter is truly interesting. She said she&rsquo;s going to chat with them, and she&rsquo;s really just chatting with them without showing her face to them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With this, those people from the Chu Heavenly Clan must be dumbstruck.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the identity of being part of the Chu Heavenly Clan is not effective on everyone either. Hahaha.&rdquo;<br>Her Lady Queen was rejoicing at the misfortune of those young masters and young ladies of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;That said, Chu Feng, this is bad. Never would I have expected that Chu Xianshuo to come here again,&rdquo; Song Xi said worriedly to Chu Feng through a voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that they&rsquo;ve also come to participate in the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s hunt?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Most definitely. They would not appear here otherwise. Furthermore, that Chu Xianshuo is no ordinary person.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only is he a well-known martial cultivation genius among the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, but he is also an amazing world spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whenever he participates in the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s hunt, he will always obtain first place. He has already obtained first place for nine successive years now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Apart from him, the other young masters and young ladies from the Chu Heavenly Clan are also not ordinary people. They are all genius world spiritists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually this many people from the Chu Heavenly Clan coming to participate in the hunt this year. I&rsquo;m afraid that they want to obtain all of the top ranks in the hunt,&rdquo; Song Xi said worriedly.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me. The hunt has yet to begin, and the outcome is yet to be decided,&rdquo; Chu Feng confronted Song Xi with a smile.<br>It was not only Song Xi that was discussing Chu Xianshuo; many other people present were also discussing him.<br>From the discussion of the crowd, Chu Feng came to find out that this Chu Xianshuo was already ninety-nine years old.<br>In another year, he would be a hundred years old. In other words, he would no longer be a member of the younger generation in a year&rsquo;s time.<br>As a result, Chu Xianshuo would naturally unable to participate in the hunt the next year.<br>It would be the final time he could participate in the hunt. Thus, he must have been prepared. After all, if he was to succeed this time around, he would&rsquo;ve obtained first place in the hunt for ten years in succession.<br>Although nine and ten only possessed a single number of difference, there was an intrinsic difference between them.<br>Thus, Chu Xianshuo placed great importance on the hunt.<br>That said, although Chu Feng had already discovered that Chu Xianshuo was very powerful, he was not afraid at all.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had learned from the conversations of the surrounding people that while Chu Xianshuo was extremely talented in world spirit techniques, he was only a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>While Chu Feng&rsquo;s current cultivation was indeed inferior to Chu Xianshuo&rsquo;s, it remained that they were both Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists. Thus, Chu Feng did not feel that he would lose to Chu Xianshuo.<br>Thus, since Chu Xianshuo, a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, was able to obtain first place, Chu Feng felt that he would also have the chance to obtain first place.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a blinding light suddenly shone down from the summit of the mountain peak and landed on Chu Feng.<br>The sudden light shocked the crowd. Chu Feng was also shocked.<br>The reason for that was because that blinding light was emitted from the palm of one of the Starfall Eight Immortals.<br>At that moment, that light had enveloped only Chu Feng. Chu Feng did not feel any special sensation from the light. However&hellip; he had already become the focus of everyone present.<br>It was not only the people down below that were looking at Chu Feng with shocked expressions; even the young masters and young ladies from the Chu Heavenly Clan up above were looking at Chu Feng with complicated expressions.<br>At that moment, the old man who had enveloped Chu Feng with the light emitted from his palm said, &ldquo;Young master, our Holy Daughter wishes to invite you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was dumbstruck by what was suddenly said to him.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that this old man has not spoken clearly. Since that&rsquo;s the case, allow me to clarify.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Holy Daughter saw you and felt that fate had brought you here. Thus, she wants to see you,&rdquo; The old man said with a smile.<br><br><br></p></div>
