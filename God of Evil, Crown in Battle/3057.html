        <h1>Chapter 3056</h1>
        <div> - Divine Level Lightning Mark<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Who I am is not important. I merely wish to inform you all to not cross that line. Otherwise&hellip; do not blame me for being impolite.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was extremely calm when he said those words. However, his tone was filled with arrogance.<br>It was a sort of tone stating that &lsquo;those that obey me shall live, and those that disobey me shall die.&rsquo;<br>At that moment, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were no longer capable of tolerating Chu Feng. One by one, they narrowed their brows and revealed displeased expressions.<br>They were, after all, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations. Never had they ever received such treatment before.<br>&ldquo;Brat, exactly who are you?! You dare to speak to us in such a manner, do you even know who we are?!&rdquo; A person from the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s group of eight asked while pointing at Chu Feng.<br>That Li Heavenly Clansman spoke those words with an extremely arrogant attitude. It was as if he were a ruler speaking down at an ordinary commoner.<br>&ldquo;I naturally know who you all are,&rdquo; Chu Feng said whilst looking at the title plates on the Li Heavenly Clansmen&rsquo;s waists.<br>However, when he said those words, the corners of his mouth were raised upward. It was as if even though he knew who they were, he still did not place them in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;You dare to act this presumptuously even after knowing who we are? Are you truly tired of living?&rdquo; The Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations grew even more displeased.<br>Suddenly, one of the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s female clansmen pointed in the direction of the Upper Realm Gate&rsquo;s main formation and shouted, &ldquo;Big brother Youbin, look over there! That brat is destroying the main formation!&rdquo;<br>It was only at that moment that the other Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations noticed that there was actually a gathering of surging power behind the main formation. It was currently unleashing destruction upon the main formation.<br>Witnessing that scene, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations came to a sudden realization that Chu Feng was actually stalling for time. His goal was to destroy the Upper Realm Gate&rsquo;s main formation.<br>One of the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s group of younger generations shouted, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation. You are truly courting death!&rdquo; Following that, he unleashed his boundless aura.<br>Rank one Heavenly Immortal. That man was a rank one Heavenly Immortal.<br>After he unleashed his aura, he took a step forward. &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; Like an imposing dragon, he rushed toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Eeaahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, that man only flew for a short distance before letting out a scream. Following that, he who was flying toward Chu Feng started flying back. In the end, he fell back to the location where the other Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were standing, and was caught by his fellows.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were all greatly alarmed. The reason for that was because that man was not only knocked back, but he was also vomiting blood. Furthermore, a bloody hole was present in his chest.<br>One must know that he was a rank one Heavenly Immortal.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said it already, do not cross that line,&rdquo; right at that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice sounded again.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him?&rdquo; After Chu Feng said those words, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations suddenly recalled that, being there, the only person that could attack them would be that unknown fellow.<br>However, why was it that they were unable to even sense his aura after he attacked?<br>&ldquo;Arrogant bastard, I shall see exactly how powerful you are!&rdquo; Right at that moment, a rank two Heavenly Immortal-level member of the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation shouted.<br>Then, like an arrow shot from a bow, he flew straight for Chu Feng.<br>Toward his curse of rage, Chu Feng originally did not even pay attention to it. Chu Feng was very nonchalant. It was as if he did not even hear him at all.<br>However, the moment that man crossed the line Chu Feng had drawn, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression immediately changed. Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and boundless martial power began to fly toward that man with extreme speed. Chu Feng&rsquo;s martial power directly struck that man back to where he came from.<br>&ldquo;It really is him!&rdquo;<br>Last time around, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations did not notice Chu Feng&rsquo;s action. However, this time around, they saw Chu Feng&rsquo;s movements clearly.<br>Indeed, it was Chu Feng who had attacked and beaten back those two men.<br>However, why was it that even though they could clearly see Chu Feng unleashing his attack, they were unable to detect Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation?<br>At that moment, fear appeared on the faces of the previously overwhelmingly arrogant Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations. They no longer dared to rashly move forward.<br>This was especially true for the three women, who actually all moved behind the men out of fear that Chu Feng would attack them.<br>At the same time as they were afraid of Chu Feng, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations all turned their eyes to that man by the name of Li Youbin.<br>Although Li Youbin was not the strongest person of the younger generation in their Li Heavenly Clan, he was the strongest among those present.<br>With a thought from Li Youbin, his clothes started to flutter.<br>At that moment, a mysterious change was happening to their entire surroundings.<br>It was Li Youbin. He had unleashed his aura. He was trying to use his aura to test out Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength.<br>That Li Youbin was no ordinary character. He actually possessed the cultivation of a rank three Heavenly Immortal.<br>His level of cultivation was more than sufficient to overlook all of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>That said, even though Chu Feng was able to clearly sense Li Youbin&rsquo;s cultivation, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression remained unchanged.<br>Not only that, but he even spoke in an indifferent manner, &ldquo;You all are no match for me. I also do not wish to harm you. Thus, it is best for you to do as I say. Else&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked to the two men that had stepped over the line he had created and were beaten back by him, &ldquo;... you will all end up like the two of them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; hearing those words, Li Youbing let out a cold snort. Then, he flipped his palm, and a blue spear appeared in his hand. It was an Incomplete Immortal Armament, a top quality Incomplete Immortal Armament.<br>Once he took out that Incomplete Immortal Armament, Li Youbin&rsquo;s battle power immediately increased greatly.<br>However, Li Youbin was not stopping with just that. With a thought, the word &lsquo;Heaven&rsquo; appeared on his forehead. It was a Heaven level Lightning Mark.<br>After his Heaven level Lightning Mark appeared, Li Youbin&rsquo;s aura increased from rank three Heavenly Immortal to rank four Heavenly Immortal.<br>Pointing his spear at Chu Feng, Li Youbin said, &ldquo;Kneel and beg for forgiveness and I will spare your dog life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to kneel and beg me for forgiveness right now, I will let you leave safely. Otherwise&hellip; even if you do not cross this line of mine, I will still teach you a lesson,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Impudent!&rdquo; Li Youbin grew furious upon hearing those words. He tightened his grasp on his Incomplete Immortal Armament and began to fly toward Chu Feng.<br>However, at the moment when Li Youbin approached Chu Feng, lightning suddenly surged around Chu Feng with a single thought. The next moment, like the two Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations before him, Li Youbin was also knocked flying back.<br>When he was caught by the other Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, Li Youbin was also vomiting blood like the two other men before him. His aura became extremely weak. He was seriously injured. Furthermore, his injury was even more serious than the two men before him.<br>At that moment, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations looked to Chu Feng again. Their expressions had changed greatly.<br>The reason for that was because not only was Chu Feng&rsquo;s entire body covered with lightning, but a character formed by the gathering of lightning had also appeared on his forehead.<br>It was the character &lsquo;Divine.&rsquo;<br></p></div>
