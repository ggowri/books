        <h1>Chapter 4145</h1>
        <div> - Entrance To Hell<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Long Daozhi had no idea that Chu Feng was still alive.<br>Because of that, he felt extremely guilty about Chu Feng&rsquo;s death. He felt that if it hadn&rsquo;t been for him requesting Chu Feng&rsquo;s help, he would not have encountered the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast and died like that.<br>That said, Long Daozhi was tasked with a heavy responsibility.<br>While he felt sadness, and blamed himself for Chu Feng&rsquo;s death, he would not give up on his important task due to it.<br>After all, the matter concerned whether or not his clan would be able to return to the Dragon Clan.<br>Time passed rapidly. In the blink of an eye it was time for the scramble for the Dragon Vein Source Stone.<br>Long Daozhi and other experts from Ancestral Martial Dragon City were gathered outside a bottomless pit.<br>The pit was enormous. If the width of the pit were akin to the size of a lake, then the size of a human might not even compare to an ant.<br>In short, a cultivator would be extremely small when standing outside that enormous and bottomless pit.<br>At that moment, a large group of people were gathered around the pit.<br>However, none of them were able to set foot into it.<br>There was an invisible spirit formation barrier protecting the entrance to the bottomless pit. That invisible spirit formation was extremely strong, and blocked all the people present.<br>Long Daozhi was also standing outside the bottomless pit. However, he was not paying much attention to it. Instead, he was examining the people present.<br>Even though they were actually all from the same clan, had all been abandoned by the Dragon Clan, and were pitiful souls like him and his Ancestral Martial Dragon City, Long Daozhi knew that they were his rivals.<br>As the saying goes &lsquo;know yourself, know your enemy, and you shall always emerge victorious.&rsquo;<br>Because of that, Long Daozhi did not dare to be careless.<br>At that moment, aside from the experts from Ancestral Martial Dragon City, there was another person beside Long Daozhi.<br>That person was none other than the renowned strongest world spiritist of Ancestral Martial Starfield, Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>That said, Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s current mental state was not very good.<br>&ldquo;City Master Long, did young friend Chu Feng really encounter a mishap?&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu asked all of a sudden.<br>He had actually already learned of Chu Feng&rsquo;s death. However, he was still unable to accept it.<br>This was also the reason why his mood was so solemn.<br>After all, he thought very highly of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, this matter is absolutely true. I witnessed it myself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault, I&rsquo;m the one who caused young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; Long Daozhi said with a look of guilt all on his face.<br>Suddenly, a mocking voice was heard, &ldquo;Long Daozhi, if you were to say that youngster simply died, I would accept it as true.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, you&rsquo;re actually saying that he was swallowed by an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast. I say you&rsquo;re joking with us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who doesn&rsquo;t know that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts are legends of the Heaven-devouring Starfield?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whilst the skeletal remains of the Ancient Heaven-devouring Beasts exist, they&rsquo;ve long been extinct.&rdquo;<br>Those words had been spoken by a middle-aged man with a black beard wearing a golden outfit.<br>The man looked very unkind.<br>There were a lot of people standing behind him who wore identical outfits.<br>Those who didn't know of him might think that he was Long Daozhi&rsquo;s rival after hearing his comments.<br>However, he was not Long Daozhi&rsquo;s rival. There was no conflict between him and Long Daozhi.<br>On the contrary, he was one of the leaders of the four powers Long Daozhi had entered an alliance with.<br>Although they had all been abandoned by the Dragon Clan, the man still looked down on the people from Ancestral Martial Dragon and Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;I know what I said is very unbelievable. However, that is what I witnessed with my very eyes.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts still exist,&rdquo; said Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;What a joke. It would appear that your Ancestral Martial Dragon City is as rumors have it, extremely useless. You&rsquo;re so useless that you have to rely on making extravagant claims to capture other&rsquo;s attention,&rdquo; said the middle-aged man.<br>&ldquo;We do not care about the business of your Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Long Daozhi, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that the Dragon Clan set a rule that five powers must join hands, we would&rsquo;ve never entered an alliance with you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best put up a good performance. After all, there are only four pieces of Dragon Vein Source Stones. If your performance is lacking, you&rsquo;re destined to be unable to obtain one.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not only limited to Long Daozhi. This is true for the rest of you too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our alliance is composed of five powers, whereas there are only four Dragon Vein Source Stones.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, whilst we might be allies, we&rsquo;ll be splitting things according to contributions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If someone ends up dragging us down, they&rsquo;re destined to have no chance of obtaining a Dragon Vein Source Stone,&rdquo; said an old lady.<br>She was the leader of another power amongst the alliance of five powers.<br>&ldquo;We know that even without your reminder.&rdquo;<br>The representatives from the other powers also spoke in response to their words.<br>Long Daozhi didn&rsquo;t say anything about this situation.<br>He had arrived at the Immortal-bestowing Upper Realm ahead of time precisely so that he could discuss a countermeasure with those four powers.<br>However, after arriving he discovered that he was the only person who had come ahead of time. The remaining four powers had only arrived recently.<br>Because of that, he knew the attitude of those four powers without asking.<br>Although they were allies, there was no trust between them. Furthermore, all of them had viewed his Ancestral Martial Dragon City as a cog to make up for the numbers they needed.<br>That said, what they didn&rsquo;t know was that Long Daozhi&rsquo;s strength was actually stronger than theirs.<br>That was also the reason why Long Daozhi did not bother arguing with them.<br>Long Daozhi was not someone who would endure humiliation. The reason why he did so was because he didn&rsquo;t want to expose his strength.<br>Since those four powers all viewed him as a cog to make up their numbers, he decided to take advantage of them, and only reveal his true strength and exactly what sort of person he, Long Daozhi, was at a crucial moment.<br>Suddenly, golden light began radiating in the sky above.<br>Seeing the change that had occurred to the sky, the people below all knelt uniformly. Long Daozhi and the others were no exception.<br>Then, eighteen floating war chariots appeared from the golden light.<br>Banners inscribed with the words &lsquo;Dragon Clan&rsquo; floated above them.<br>Those that had arrived in the war chariots were the people from the Dragon Clan.<br>&ldquo;We pay our respect to Milords!&rdquo;<br>Thunderous voices sounded from below when they saw the appearance of the people from the Dragon Clan.<br>&ldquo;You all can rise.&rdquo;<br>An aged voice sounded from within the leading chariot.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, this pit is called the Endless Abyss. Inside it is our Dragon Clan&rsquo;s precious cultivation resource, Dragon Vein Source Stone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This Endless Abyss came from the Ancient Era and is protected with an Ancient Era&rsquo;s grand formation. It is not an easy task to breach it. Furthermore, after entering you shall take responsibility for your own life and death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If anyone wishes to give up now you can leave,&rdquo; said an old man.<br>The eighteen Dragon Clan war chariots that had appeared were all enormous in size. They most definitely contained a lot of people.<br>However, not a single person had shown themselves. Even the old man who had spoken had not shown himself.<br>It was as if the people below weren't qualified to see their appearances.<br>Their attitudes were extremely condescending.<br>Yet, none of the people below dared to express any discontent.<br>No one dared to leave either.<br>Instead, they all spoke to express their resolutions to enter the bottomless pit.<br>Seeing that, the old man&rsquo;s satisfied laughter sounded from the war chariot.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you all have come prepared. Very well, you have some bravery.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since that is the case, I will provide you with some assistance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Dragon Clan will soon help you all activate this Ancient Era&rsquo;s grand formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once it&rsquo;s activated, multiple entrances will appear. However, those entrances need five world spiritists to open them simultaneously. Only then can the entrances be breached. Once breached, you all will be able to enter the Endless Abyss.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, this Endless Abyss will still be filled with countless dangers. But, the opportunity to obtain the Dragon Vein Source Stone lies inside it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are a total of four Dragon Vein Source Stones inside the Endless Abyss. Anyone that obtains a Dragon Vein Source Stone can take all their clansmen and return to the Dragon Clan.&rdquo;<br>After the old man had spoken, the eighteen war chariots began emitting light filled with runes and symbols.<br>The lights combined, and then shot straight into the Endless Abyss.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before the light could enter the Endless Abyss it was obstructed by a layer of spirit formation.<br>At that moment, the invisible spirit formation finally revealed itself.<br>Upon seeing the spirit formation, all the world spiritists present sucked in a mouthful of cold air.<br>They were all helpers that had been requested by the various powers. They were crucial to breaching the spirit formation.<br>However, after seeing the grand formation all of them felt extreme pressure.<br>The reason for that was because what accompanied the appearance of the grand formation was a terrifying aura.<br>That terrifying aura had emerged from deep within the Endless Abyss. It was an extremely intense aura of death.<br>As world spiritists had been perceptions, the Endless Abyss appeared more like hell than anything else to them.<br></p></div>
