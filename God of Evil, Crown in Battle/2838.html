        <div> - Gathering Of Peers<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to milord.&rdquo;<br>After being stunned momentarily, those disciples kneeled uniformly on the ground. Not only were there disciples that started to sweat cold sweat, but there were even disciples that started to shiver in fear. None of them dared to raise their head.<br>The reason for that was because the person that appeared before them was the leader of the Starfall Eight Immortals.<br>Even though those disciples were simply unable to determine which of the Starfall Eight Immortals was the eldest, it remained that the Starfall Eight Immortals were extremely renowned individuals that very few people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm didn&rsquo;t know. Any one of them would be able to call on the wind and summon the rain.<br>Taking the power that those disciples belonged to for an example, a sneeze from any one of the Starfall Eight Immortals could utterly destroy their power. As such, how could they not be afraid?<br>&ldquo;You all can stand up, I won&rsquo;t eat you.&rdquo;<br>Elder Xingyi of the Stafall Eight Immortals was quite an amiable person. Even though those disciples were existences akin to ants to him, he did not reveal a high and above attitude.<br>Then, Elder Xingyi looked to Chu Feng. With a smile on his face, he said, &ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, why are you disguising yourself?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt a bit embarrassed upon hearing that. Although his disguise was capable of fooling a lot of people, it was evidently incapable of fooling Elder Xingyi.<br>Since he had already been exposed, there was naturally no need for him to continue with his disguise. As such, Chu Feng revealed his true appearance.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! He is actually Chu Feng?!&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s true appearance, those disciples, regardless of their gender, were all stunned. Both their expressions and movements completely manifested the astonishment that they were feeling.<br>That said, they were only astonished at the fact that they were actually able to encounter the person that they admired in such a place<br>Upon recalling that they were actually mocking and ridiculing the disguised Chu Feng, they felt themselves to be somewhat ridiculous.<br>That said, compared to the people that were praising Chu Feng earlier, that man with a face filled with pockmarks was completely stunned.<br>At that moment, his complexion was as pale as paper. He was sweating like a pig, and shivering from head to toe. Even standing had become difficult for him.<br>He was afraid, deeply afraid that Chu Feng would retaliate against him.<br>Chu Feng was someone who dared to kill even Yuwen Tingyi and Yuwen Hualong. If a nobody like him were to offend Chu Feng, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that only death awaited him?<br>However, Chu Feng did not make things difficult for any of them. He merely smiled at them and then clasped his fist respectfully at Elder Xingyi.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng pays his respects to senior.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, the two of us could be said to be old acquaintances now. There is no need for you to be this courteous. For you to be here, have you also come for the sake of the Void Sacred Tree?&rdquo; Elder Xingyi asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ve heard that this place is a sacred land for cultivation. Because of that, I&rsquo;ve decided to come and check things out,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, it was merely a rumor. We were all deceived by someone. The various powers are all trying to capture the person that spread that false rumor right now. If that person is captured, he will likely pay considerably for this. After all, he has deceived quite a few people,&rdquo; Elder Xingyi said.<br>&ldquo;It is possible that person did not deceive us. Rather&hellip; we were unable to see what he saw,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;When others failed to see what they wanted to see, they all determined the rumor to be false, and the person that spread it to be a liar.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, little friend Chu Feng actually still thinks this rumor to possibly be true. From this, it could be seen that little friend Chu Feng has a broad heart. For you to be able to have such a broad and open heart at such a young age, this old man is in admiration,&rdquo; Elder Xingyi said.<br>&ldquo;Elder Xingyi is flattering me. It is merely my own little guess. This Chu Feng also does not know exactly what the truth is,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Mn, what you&rsquo;ve said is reasonable. That said, little friend Chu Feng, what do you plan to do now?&rdquo; Elder Xingyi asked.<br>&ldquo;I wish to continue to observe the Void Sacred Tree. If I am unable to find anything still, I will be leaving this place,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve come here, you shouldn&rsquo;t journey so far in vain. Our Holy Daughter and Holy Son are currently at a gathering with some of their peers. Apart from our Holy Daughter and Holy Son, the Dao Imperial Palace&rsquo;s little friend Jian Wuqing, the Paradise Valley&rsquo;s little friend Ren Xiaoyao and the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Ghosteye Boy are also present.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After our Holy Daughter and Holy Son heard that little friend Chu Feng was also here, they deliberately had this old man come to invite little friend Chu Feng to join the gathering,&rdquo; Elder Xingyi said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng realized that Elder Xingyi should&rsquo;ve noticed him long ago.<br>However, Chu Feng was still somewhat hesitant. Places with women would always have quarrels. This was even more so for that girl Xia Yun&rsquo;er. She was a poisonous and extremely dangerous woman.<br>For her to have Elder Xingyi come and invite Chu Feng, who knows what sort of trap she might have waiting for him?<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, our Holy Daughter has said that if anyone is to make things difficult for you, you can ignore them. Furthermore, if anyone is to try to harm you, our Holy Daughter will definitely not ignore it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man is able to guarantee your safety.&rdquo;<br>Elder Xingyi seemed to know about Chu Feng&rsquo;s worry, and actually guaranteed to Chu Feng that he would be safe.<br>Hearing what Elder Xingyi said, Chu Feng smiled. He said, &ldquo;What if the one that wanted to harm me is your Holy Daughter?&rdquo;<br>Although Chu Feng said those words with a joking tone, he informed Elder Xingyi that the person he was worried about was none other than their Holy Daughter.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, this old man does not dare to guarantee anything about what might happen in the future., However, since it is this old man that is inviting you today, I will definitely guarantee your safety,&rdquo; Elder Xingyi said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, just go to the gathering. Those people might all be your future rivals. You should use this opportunity to scout them out,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>After hearing what Her Lady Queen said, Chu Feng had a change of heart.<br>After all, what Her Lady Queen said was also what he was thinking. He also wanted to see those geniuses on the Demon-level Geniuses List.<br>&ldquo;Senior, may I know where they currently are?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re actually right over there,&rdquo; Elder Xingyi pointed to the empty sky nearby.<br>There was clearly nothing there. However, after being pointed out by Elder Xingyi, Chu Feng was able to tell that region of empty sky trembled slightly.<br>Chu Feng realized that there should be a spirit formation or some sort of treasure at that place. Xia Yun&rsquo;er and the others should be within that spirit formation or treasure.<br>&ldquo;I will have to trouble senior,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist again.<br>Hearing what Chu Feng said, Elder Xingyi smiled happily. Then, he said, &ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, please follow me.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, that group of disciples&rsquo; eldest martial brother suddenly said, &ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, please wait.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked. His attitude was very good-natured.<br>&ldquo;I have a question that I wish to inquire of Lord Chu Feng. Might that be possible?&rdquo; That eldest martial brother said.<br>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Did Lord Chu Feng really personally kill Yuwen Tingyi and Yuwen Hualong in Yuwen City?&rdquo; That eldest martial brother asked.<br>Once he asked that question, not to mention those people that were filled with admiration for Chu Feng, even Elder Xingyi&rsquo;s expression changed slightly. It would appear that even Elder Xingyi wanted to know the answer from Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It was indeed done by me. Merely, I cannot tell you how I accomplished it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, Elder Xingyi smiled profoundly. Then, he waved his sleeve, and both him and Chu Feng disappeared.<br>The group of disciples was still there. Their expressions were very complicated, Feeling both excited and emotional. Whilst At the same time, they were also overjoyed.<br><br><br></p></div>
