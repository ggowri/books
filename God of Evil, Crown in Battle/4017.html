        <h1>Chapter 4016</h1>
        <div> - The Awakened Zhao Hong<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;This girl, she&rsquo;s actually able to stand up?&rdquo;<br>Zhao Hong&rsquo;s roar caught the crowd&rsquo;s attention. The moment they looked at her, they felt completely surprised.<br>Zhao Hong had been lying in midair like a dying person only moments before.<br>Yet at that moment, not only was she standing, but she even let out such an ear-piercing roar.<br>This momentarily caused everyone present to feel somewhat dumbfounded. They didn't understand what was happening.<br>That said, they did not pay too much attention to her either.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next instant, rumbles sounded in the sky. As the rumbles sounded, heaven and earth were enveloped by darkness.<br>Looking up, the crowd all found themselves completely stunned.<br>An abnormal sign had actually appeared deep in the sky.<br>An enormous surging vortex was present in the depths of the sky.<br>The vortex was so enormous that it covered the entire visible sky. It was as if the vortex was capable of drawing in the entire region at any moment.<br>Wind, lightning and flames could all be seen surging within the vortex.<br>It seemed as if that vortex was the entrance to hell.<br>From a glance, such an abnormal sign was a sight of marvel.<br>However, should one look carefully, one would feel endless fear toward it.<br>&ldquo;This abnormal sign!&rdquo;<br>The crowd started panicking.<br>Regardless of whether it might be the leaders of the various great powers or the spectators that were hiding, they were all terrified by the sight in the sky.<br>They&rsquo;d all seen countless abnormal signs before. However, never had they seen one so terrifying.<br>At the moment when the crowd were all staring at the abnormal sign in the sky, someone said something different, &ldquo;Look! That Zhao Hong!&rdquo;<br>When the crowd turned their eyes to Zhao Hong, they seemed to realize why such an abnormal sign had appeared.<br>Zhao Hong was floating in midair. However, her appearance was completely different from before. Her long hair was fluttering in the wind, and her eyes were blood-red. She looked like a demoness that had descended onto the mortal world.<br>Violent hurricane-like winds had enveloped her body. Elemental energies of lightning and flames were present in the violent cyclone. Like guards, they protected Zhao Hong.<br>Gathered together, the elements were identical to the abnormal sign in the sky. Even the auras they emitted were identical.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her!&rdquo;<br>The crowd all came to a sudden realization.<br>It turned out that the terrifying abnormal sign had been caused by Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have all of you die!&rdquo;<br>As Zhao Hong spoke, her body shifted, and she disappeared.<br>When she appeared again, she had arrived before the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>Like a sharp blade, she thrust her hand towards his neck.<br>The Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster attempted to dodge.<br>Unfortunately, Zhao Hong&rsquo;s speed was simply too fast. &lsquo;Puchi,&rsquo; Zhao Hong&rsquo;s hand penetrated his neck. Then, she forcibly raised him up.<br>The Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster held onto his neck with both hands, and his legs kicked violently. He was struggling. Unfortunately, his struggling was completely useless.<br>Facing the fierce Zhao Hong, he behaved like he had lost his battle power. Apart from struggling, he was unable to do anything else.<br>The reason for that was because the aura Zhao Hong emitted at that moment had changed. She was no longer a rank four Utmost Exalted. She had become a rank five Utmost Exalted.<br>For cultivators, the difference of a single level of cultivation was akin to the difference between heaven and earth.<br>Even though the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster was a rank four Utmost Exalted, he was completely powerless against Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;She&hellip; her Cultivation, how did it increase?!&rdquo;<br>Seeing Zhao Hong&rsquo;s increased cultivation, many people started to panic.<br>In terms of being afraid, the one that felt the most afraid was not the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster or the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster. Rather&hellip; it was the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>Even though the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had been seriously injured, people from the All-heaven Sect had immediately and finally rushed over to treat his injuries the moment Chu Feng was subdued.<br>Being treated by the experts of the All-heaven Sect, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, although still seriously injured, had managed to restore his physical body.<br>At that moment, he laid on a seat in the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s camp, still surrounded by his subordinates and appearing very mighty.<br>From this, it could be seen that even though he had knelt before Zhao Hong and confessed to what he had done, even though he'd done something so humiliating, no one from the All-heaven Sect dared to show any disrespect towards him.<br>Yet, at that moment, his gaze shook violently. Fear could be seen deep within his eyes.<br>After Zhao Hong&rsquo;s cultivation increased to rank five Utmost Exalted, he knew what sort of end awaited him.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>He suddenly stood up and, disregarding his injuries, unleashed all of his power to dash into the distant sky.<br>He was trying to flee.<br>He was not the only one. The Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster had also turned around to flee.<br>In fact, even the disciples and elders of the All-heaven Sect, the Wind Lightning Sword Sect and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain all began fleeing.<br>They not only felt Zhao Hong&rsquo;s rank five Utmost Exalted aura, but they also felt her overflowing killing intent.<br>They all felt that after having experienced her earlier torment, Zhao Hong would, now that she had gained power surpassing everyone present, very possibly unleash a massacre.<br>For the sake of not being killed, it was their best choice to flee immediately.<br>In fact, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had already fled.<br>By the time the crowd had discovered that the abnormal sign had been caused by Zhao Hong, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s figure had disappeared.<br>He had discovered the change to Zhao Hong before everyone else. Thus, he had been the first person to flee.<br>When even the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had fled, they would naturally have to flee too.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, space started trembling and a powerful aura swept through the sky.<br>Then, regardless of whether it be the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster or the elders and disciples, all the people that were attempting to flee froze. They became stuck in their fleeing postures, but were completely frozen in midair.<br>It was oppressive might!<br>Zhao Hong&rsquo;s oppressive might had covered the entire region and enveloped everyone present.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a muffled explosion was heard.<br>It was caused by the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>Looking over, the crowd were no longer able to see him.<br>The reason for that was because his body had turned into a mist of blood that spread around Zhao Hong.<br>Seeing that, the hearts of everyone present trembled. This was especially true for the people of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect. They felt extremely pained, and some even suffered a nervous breakdown; wailing on the spot.<br>They all knew that the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had been killed by Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>After the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster died, an incomparably panicked scream sounded.<br>Before that, no one would&rsquo;ve imagined that it could actually be the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster who let out that terrified scream.<br>However, he not only screamed in terror, but he was even begging for forgiveness.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill me! Don&rsquo;t kill me! I merely wanted to scare them! I never planned on killing them! Besides, that stone case&rsquo;s mysterious treasure belonged to me from the very start, I merely wanted to retrieve what was mine. I wasn&rsquo;t in the wrong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hatred nor grievance between you and I. Even if you want to protect your friends, you should at least be reasonable, no?&rdquo;<br>The Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster was renowned for his violent temper.<br>Yet, at that moment, the &lsquo;violent temper&rsquo; he was renowned for could not be found anywhere.<br>Rather, &lsquo;scared witless&rsquo; would be the most appropriate description.<br>However, his panic was understandable too. After personally witnessing the death of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster at Zhao Hong&rsquo;s hands, he knew how ruthless she was.<br>If he didn&rsquo;t beg for forgiveness, he feared that he would be the next person to die.<br>After all, there had only been three people torturing Zhao Hong, Chu Feng and the others earlier.<br>They were the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, and him.<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had already fled, and the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had been killed. With that being the case, he knew very well what awaited him.<br>Truth be told, he felt so much regret at that moment, that his intestines had already turned green.<br>He regretted coveting the stone case world&rsquo;s mysterious treasure, and making things difficult for Chu Feng and the others because of it.<br>Now, he was on the verge of losing his life. Truly, his gains could not make up for his losses.<br>&ldquo;Can you please give me a chance?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know exactly what sort of person I am.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll compensate your friends. I can apologize to them, and compensate them with treasures.&rdquo;<br>The more the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster thought about it, the more terrified he became.<br>Although he'd appeared fearless earlier, at that moment he was on the verge of crying from fear.<br></p></div>
