        <div>: Risking<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You can ask Black Demon yourself what that item is once you return. I&rsquo;ll only tell you how you can take it with you. Do you see this? The energy in here is used to nourish that item.&rdquo;<br>As Lord Yunliang spoke, he raised a jade bottle and uncorked it.<br>&ldquo;I need you to construct a formation and conceal it within the energy. Later on, when the energy is used to nourish the item, your formation will be entering the item together with the energy. Through your formation, we&rsquo;ll break the lock on the item and take it away with us.<br>&ldquo;As for how the formation should be constructed and whether we can take the item away with us, that would depend on how capable you are,&rdquo; Lord Yunliang said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Yunliang, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, the cultivators in the prison earlier are possessors of unique bloodlines. Bloodlines tend to repel one another, and there are the powers of numerous different bloodlines in there. Can the item really endure being nourished like that?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was asking this question to get some hints about the item the Wretched Black Demon was planning to obtain. The ominous feeling he was getting was becoming stronger and stronger.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of your business.&rdquo;<br>However, his question only brought about the criticism of Lord Yunliang.<br>&ldquo;I understand. I would like to ask some questions regarding my role then. Since the item Lord Black Demon hopes to obtain is highly valued in your Asura World Spirit Army, it must be heavily guarded. If so, wouldn&rsquo;t the formation I construct on the energy be seen through easily?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to worry about that. The Asura World Spirit Army consists solely of world spirits; there are no world spiritists amongst us. As long as your world spirit techniques are up to par, no one will be able to see through it. Unless&hellip; you&rsquo;re just all talk. That&rsquo;s why I said that whether this mission will succeed or not depends on you.<br>&ldquo;Lad, your life is in your own hands right now,&rdquo; Lord Yunliang said.<br>&ldquo;I understand. I&rsquo;ll give it all I got,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Even though he harbored great enmity toward Lord Yunliang, on the surface, he still put on a respectful attitude so as to not incur the latter&rsquo;s suspicions.<br>&ldquo;You may set up your formation here. I still have matters to attend to, so I&rsquo;ll be leaving first. Make sure to stay here obediently and don&rsquo;t wander around. If I were to know that you have left my sleeping chamber, even if no one discovers your identity, I won&rsquo;t let you off either.&rdquo;<br>Lord Yunliang&rsquo;s eyes were filled with killing intent when he said those words. He was making it clear that he wasn&rsquo;t joking over here.<br>&ldquo;Lord Yunliang, please put your heart at ease. I&rsquo;ll not walk around carelessly. I&rsquo;ll stay here and complete my mission,&rdquo; Chu Feng quickly replied.<br>After that, Lord Yunliang left the room, leaving Chu Feng all alone.<br>Chu Feng should have started constructing a formation inside the bottle, but his mind was simply too much of a mess for him to concentrate at the moment. While he and Wang Yuxian weren&rsquo;t life-and-death buddies, at the very least, they were on close terms with one another.<br>He couldn&rsquo;t just leave her to the lurch.<br>He struggled mentally for a moment before he finally spoke up, &ldquo;Eggy, I might be risking my life once more.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Go ahead and do what you need to.&rdquo;<br>It was a short sentence, but it expressed her greatest support for Chu Feng&rsquo;s intention.<br>It had always been like this all along. Despite knowing the dangers involved, as long as Chu Feng wished to proceed ahead, she would go along with him.<br>After receiving Eggy&rsquo;s support, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart was finally put at ease. He was going to save Wang Yuxian, and while it would be a gamble, he still had a certain degree of confidence here.<br>After all, he had received an important piece of information from Lord Yunliang earlier.<br>While the evil spirits here were incredibly powerful, none of them was skilled in formations. This was an opening that Chu Feng could exploit.<br>As long as Lord Yunliang wasn&rsquo;t deceiving him, there was still a good chance that Chu Feng could save Wang Yuxian from the prison. In fact, if nothing went wrong, it wouldn&rsquo;t affect his task of obtaining the item the Wretched Black Demon sought.<br>After making up his mind, Chu Feng quickly got to action.<br>The first thing he did was to set up a formation in the room and leave a clone behind in his place. This clone would be constructing the formation in the bottle in his place.<br>He had to do this in case Lord Yunliang suddenly returned to conduct a spot check on him.<br>After that, Chu Feng proceeded on to construct a fake Wang Yuxian so as to conduct a swap later on. Then, Chu Feng violated his rule and altered his own appearance to that of Lord Yunliang&rsquo;s. On top of that, he even constructed a formation to create a fake token.<br>Last but not least, Chu Feng tapped into the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak and his own spirit power to conceal himself.<br>With everything in place, he was finally ready to infiltrate the prison.<br>Chu Feng was still worried about the feasibility of the plan initially, but when he walked past numerous evil spirits and none of them detected him, his heart was put at ease.<br>The prison was tightly guarded, and many of the evil spirits in there were far stronger than Chu Feng. Yet, none of them noticed his presence.<br>This showed that they were fairly helpless against formations and the sort.<br>Finally, Chu Feng arrived before the tightly guarded cell where Wang Yuxian was in.<br>Having come this far, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart suddenly began thumping in uncertainty once more.<br>This cell was different from the other prison cells. It was made of a unique material that Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power couldn&rsquo;t breach. In fact, he couldn&rsquo;t even see what was happening inside.<br>There was only one way for Chu Feng to enter the cell, and that was to have the guards open it.<br>In other words, he would have to reveal himself and, using the identity of Lord Yunliang, order the guards to open the door.<br>With these thoughts in mind, he immediately got to action. He first dispelled his own invisibility some distance away before strutting proudly toward the guards.<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to Lord Yunliang.&rdquo;<br>The guards bowed respectfully to Chu Feng, but just like before, they showed no signs of opening the cell right away.<br>Emulating Lord Yunliang&rsquo;s actions, he took out the token with the words &lsquo;Asura King&rsquo; inscribed on it. Of course, this token was the one he had forged earlier.<br>Unexpectedly, things didn&rsquo;t go as smoothly as Chu Feng wished.<br>&ldquo;Lord Yunliang, didn&rsquo;t you collect their powers earlier? Do you have any special tasks to come by once more?&rdquo;<br>Instead of opening the door right away, the guards began questioning his intention. It was a bit different from how they had treated the real Lord Yunliang earlier.<br>&ldquo;Are you telling me to report what I do to you?&rdquo;<br>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t lose his nerves. Instead, his face warped in rage as he berated those guards domineeringly.<br>&ldquo;I dare not to!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Lord Yunliang had lost his tempers, the guards immediately trembled in fright. Not daring to ask any more questions, they quickly opened the doors to the cell.<br>It could be seen that they were terrified of Lord Yunliang.<br>As soon as Chu Feng entered the cell, he closed the door right away before scanning the surroundings.<br>He realized that the three humans who were still living when he left earlier had died, and the only one still breathing was Wang Yuxian.<br>&ldquo;Old beast, you&rsquo;re here again. Do your worst! I&rsquo;m not scared of you!&rdquo;<br>Wang Yuxian thought that Lord Yunliang had returned once more to torture her, so she began cursing him.<br>She was already in a severely weakened state, yet her attitude remained forceful and unyielding.<br>&ldquo;Shh, Lele. It&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng called out to Wang Yuxian using voice transmission. At the same time, his appearance also began changing, reverting from that of Lord Yunliang to his own.<br>He had to do this in order to prove his identity to Wang Yuxian.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, is it really you? What are you doing here? And&hellip; what are you doing with those beasts?&rdquo;<br>Wang Yuxian assessed Chu Feng with an incredulous voice.<br>As expected, she had really recognized Chu Feng from the start, but she simply couldn&rsquo;t understand why Chu Feng was siding with the evil spirits.<br>&ldquo;Lele, I&rsquo;ll explain it to you later on. Right now, we need to leave first.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng said those words, he began setting up a formation to free Wang Yuxian from her shackles.<br>&ldquo;Brat, it looks like you&rsquo;re really tired of living!&rdquo;<br>But all of a sudden, a sharp, cold voice sounded.<br>Following that, the space began to tremor, and a silhouette came into appearance.<br>Lord Yunliang!<br></p></div>
