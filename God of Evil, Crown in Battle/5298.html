        <h1>Chapter 5299</h1>
        <div>: Underestimating<br>&ldquo;Why would I have this token if I was lying? Jia Lingyi gave this token to my father as a symbol of goodwill. It was a benefit we received for dealing with your grandmother on her behalf.<br>&ldquo;Jia Dongqi came here not to protect us but to enquire about your affairs. Don&rsquo;t believe his claims of mediating our conflict. He&rsquo;s merely looking for an opportunity to get rid of you! Jia Lingyi wouldn&rsquo;t allow Song Luoyi&rsquo;s descendant to exist in this world, especially not a talented one!&rdquo; Situ Kunye said.<br>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t believe him, Chu Feng! It&rsquo;s all nonsense!&rdquo; Jia Dongqi exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;Are you still trying to spin lies? My grandmother&rsquo;s old attendant told me that Jia Lingyi is her close sister,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Jia Dongqi was put at a loss for words. &ldquo;I admit that our young miss is on close terms with your grandmother, but think about it! Why would our young miss harm your grandmother if they are on close terms with each other?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng sneered upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;You said that your young miss is of lofty standing. If she&rsquo;s really close with my grandmother, why did she turn a blind eye to my grandmother&rsquo;s plight when the Situ World Spiritist Clan was oppressing the Golden Dragon Flame Sect?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; Jia Dongqi was stunned. He hurriedly explained, &ldquo;Chu Feng. there&rsquo;s a reason for that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A reason?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll honestly tell you now that my grandmother&rsquo;s old attendant has never told me about her ties with Jia Lingyi.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah? You&hellip;&rdquo; Jia Dongqi belatedly realized that he had been scammed.<br>&ldquo;I just wanted to verify whether Jia Lingyi was close to my grandmother. If they were truly close sisters, there&rsquo;s no way Jia Lingyi would leave the Situ World Spiritist Clan be after learning about their evil deed, let alone give her token to them&hellip; unless she&rsquo;s the perpetrator!&rdquo; Chu Feng said with certainty.<br>Chu Feng had been assessing Situ Kunye and Jia Dongqi&rsquo;s reactions.<br>Situ Kunye had no reason to lie when he knew that he was already doomed. In particular, the anger that he displayed when Jia Dongqi declared that he would destroy the Situ World Spiritist Clan didn&rsquo;t look feigned.<br>And from the start to the end, Jia Dongqi looked flustered. This was enough to show that Situ Kunye hadn&rsquo;t been lying.<br>Jia Lingyi was the true mastermind behind the Golden Dragon Flame Sect&rsquo;s destruction.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you shouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Jia Dongqi tried to argue on the matter. He wasn&rsquo;t scared of Chu Feng, but he was afraid of tarnishing his young miss&rsquo; reputation. If Jia Lingyi didn&rsquo;t care about her reputation, she wouldn&rsquo;t have entrusted the matter to the Pill Dao Immortal Sect in the first place.<br>Gah!<br>Jia Dongqi shrieked in pain before he could finish his sentence. Chu Feng had tightened the formation hand around him.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you one last chance. Is what Situ Kunye said true?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He already had an answer in mind, but he still wanted to hear confirmation from Jia Dongqi. To do so, he exerted the prowess of the &lsquo;Offense&rsquo; formation to its greatest level, rendering Jia Dongqi helpless.<br>Jia Dongqi could sense from Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing intent that he wasn&rsquo;t joking around. After some hesitation, he finally raised his head to look at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Situ Kunye is right. Our young miss has sent me here to scout out your affairs. However, you mustn&rsquo;t go against our young miss. You have to feign ignorance. Otherwise, both of us will be goners. You might not know the means our young miss possesses because you&rsquo;re an outsider, but our young miss can kill you as easily as she can crush an ant. Even your grandmother wasn&rsquo;t a match for her back then, let alone&hellip;&rdquo; Jia Dongqi spoke through voice transmission.<br>Bam!<br>With a dull thud, Jia Dongqi was reduced to a puddle of bloodied water. Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t bother hearing him out to the end. All he needed was confirmation that Jia Lingyi was the culprit.<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t afford to dawdle around.<br>Jia Dongqi was only acting subservient because Chu Feng had the upper hand. In order to curb him, Chu Feng had to push the power of the &lsquo;Offense&rsquo; formation to its limit. This resulted in the rapid depletion of the &lsquo;Offense&rsquo; formation&rsquo;s energy.<br>To be safe, he had to quickly resolve everything here before the &lsquo;Offense&rsquo; formation ran out of energy.<br>Chu Feng channeled the power of the formation and manifested a massive sword in his hand. Then, he turned his sights toward the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen.<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen began kneeling down on the floor to beg for mercy, but Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t pay them any heed. He had already given them a chance, but they refused to cherish it.<br>&ldquo;No matter who the mastermind is, there&rsquo;s no denying that your hands are stained with the blood of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect. You deserve to die,&rdquo; Chu Feng told Situ Kunye.<br>Situ Kunye also knew that he was going to die. He tried his best to stay calm, but he couldn&rsquo;t stop his body from trembling. He was afraid of death too.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng! If you&rsquo;re that great, why don&rsquo;t you kill Jia Lingyi and destroy Immortal Slaughterer? They have the blood of Golden Dragon Flame Sect on their hands too!&rdquo; Situ Kunye roared.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll reunite with them on the road to the netherworld.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng lifted his massive sword and swung it outward.<br>Shoosh!<br>A burst of sword qi flashed across the air, and countless pillars of blood spurted out. The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen had been decapitated!<br>The crowd was shocked. How could they not be when they had just witnessed the death of tens of millions of people in a single strike?<br>Yet, Chu Feng was hardly fazed by the cruelty he had just inflicted on the Situ World Spiritist Clan. Instead, he turned his sights toward the crowd, particularly those who had spoken up for the Situ World Spiritist Clan earlier.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, please calm down! We&rsquo;re only doing this for our own survival!&rdquo;<br>It wasn&rsquo;t just those who had insulted Chu Feng earlier who fell to their knees. Even those who had merely spectated the earlier scene did the same too. They were afraid that Chu Feng would kill them in a moment of bloodthirst.<br>Someone who had the guts to kill Jia Dongqi wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to take their lives.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, kill them,&rdquo; Eggy urged.<br>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t do as he was told. He collected the corpses of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect&rsquo;s members and the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen before leaving the area.<br>It was only after Chu Feng disappeared on the horizon that the crowd finally fell onto their bums. They felt like they had just survived an ordeal.<br>&hellip;<br>Chu Feng cast his concealment as he flitted across the air. As he got further away from the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s headquarters, he gradually lost control over the powerful formation energy he had obtained earlier.<br>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you kill them?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;To silence them? That&rsquo;s not my way of doing things,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>Eggy had urged Chu Feng to kill the crowd in order to ensure that Situ Kunye&rsquo;s words wouldn&rsquo;t get out. As long as the Pill Dao Immortal Sect thought that Chu Feng remained oblivious to the truth of his grandmother&rsquo;s death, it was likely that they wouldn&rsquo;t make a move on him.<br>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t want to kill the innocent.<br>&ldquo;They insulted you earlier. They deserve to die,&rdquo; Eggy insisted.<br>&ldquo;Forget it, I&rsquo;ll give them a chance. They do have their own families to take care of.&rdquo;<br>It was not once or twice that Chu Feng had encountered onlookers who sided with the strong to scorn him. While he thought that such people deserved to be punished, he didn&rsquo;t think that they deserved death.<br>&ldquo;You have become soft,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;I grew up,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Tsk.&rdquo; Eggy clicked her tongue, but she didn&rsquo;t blame him. Instead, a beautiful smile formed on her lips.<br>She had really wanted to kill those onlookers because they had insulted Chu Feng earlier. It didn&rsquo;t matter to her whether they had families to take care of or not. She didn&rsquo;t have that much sympathy in her.<br>However, she unconditionally supported Chu Feng&rsquo;s way of doing things. That was simply the type of person she was.<br>When Chu Feng finally felt like he had gotten far enough, he descended into a forest.<br>&ldquo;What should we do next? Are we going to look for Lord Yuwei?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t gotten rid of the real enemy yet. I&rsquo;ll get rid of my grandmother&rsquo;s enemies and present their heads all at once,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;From the looks of it, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like Jia Lingyi will be an easy opponent to deal with,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;That might be true now, but it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before she is nothing more than an ant to me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Pft!&rdquo; Eggy burst into laughter.<br>&ldquo;Why are you laughing, Milady Queen? Do you think that I&rsquo;m boasting?&rdquo; Chu FEng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. Who do you think I am? I have been accompanying you ever since your time in the Nine Provinces Continent. I watched you grow from a second-rate disciple to your current state. What&rsquo;s there to boast about? You have faced countless stronger enemies in the past and have come close to death many times before. Which of them isn&rsquo;t an ant to you now?&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;Then why is Milady Queen laughing?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m overjoyed. You were able to remain calm after learning the truth behind your grandmother&rsquo;s death, not because you don&rsquo;t care but that you are confident that you&rsquo;ll be able to avenge her. You believe that it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before you trample over her. Isn&rsquo;t your confidence something worth celebrating?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Milady Queen. You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.<br>&ldquo;What do you plan to do now?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;Being confident is one thing, but I can&rsquo;t afford to slack off on my cultivation. I&rsquo;ll first look through the loot I have received. Eggy, you should also refine the origin energies I have just collected,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Chu Feng had made sure to collect the origin energies of everyone he had slaughtered earlier, including that of Jia Dongqi.<br>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll cultivate together,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>Both Situ Kunye and Jia Dongqi carriedmany treasures with them. Chu Feng gathered the treasures that could raise his martial power and absorbed them, including the martial bead Mo Yuhan had given him. To his dismay, they weren&rsquo;t of much help to him. He still had a long way to go before making a breakthrough.<br>The Dragon Inner Core should be of significant help to him, but he hadn&rsquo;t fully refined it yet.<br>&ldquo;This feeling?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng quickly projected his consciousness into his World Spirit Space, where he saw raging black flames covering huge swathes of land. The black flames were tinged with such malicious energy that Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but get goosebumps.<br>And the origin of the black flames was none other than Eggy.<br>The black flames soon seeped into Eggy&rsquo;s body, and she opened her eyes. A regal aura reminiscent of a conqueror naturally flowed from her.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart jolted.<br>But as soon as Eggy noticed Chu Feng, she broke out into a smile and said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, what brings you in here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milady Queen, you made a breakthrough?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I did. It&rsquo;s a pity that there weren&rsquo;t enough origin energies to sustain my further breakthroughs, so I had to stop at rank one Half-God level.&rdquo; Eggy shrugged. She didn&rsquo;t seem to be content with this outcome.<br>&ldquo;Milady Queen, how&rsquo;s your current fighting prowess?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Eggy had commanded a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation back in Martial Exalted level, but her fighting prowess would likely dip now that she had reached Half-God level.<br>&ldquo;Fighting prowess? How should I put this&hellip;&rdquo; Eggy mischievously blinked her eyes and drew out the suspense before finally giving away the answer. &ldquo;Rank four Half-God level. That&rsquo;s my limit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re able to rival enemies three cultivation ranks higher despite having reached Half-God level? As expected of Milady Queen.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was overjoyed. While Eggy had lost a bit of her fighting prowess from her recent breakthrough, being able to rival enemies three cultivation ranks stronger was still nothing to be scoffed at.<br>However, what Eggy mentioned next made him realize that he was still underestimating her.<br>&ldquo;I should be able to regain my previous heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four cultivation ranks given sufficient time,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br></div>
