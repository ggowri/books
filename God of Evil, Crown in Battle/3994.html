        <h1>Chapter 3993</h1>
        <div> - The Cunning Demon Fox<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Young master, what do you mean by that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A&rsquo;li doesn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;<br>Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, A&rsquo;li looked to him innocently.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t understand?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled. He walked and began to fiddle with the sacred key in his hand.<br>A&rsquo;li&rsquo;s gaze followed him and the sacred key that was being flicked around in his hand repeatedly.<br>It could be seen that she deeply longed for the key.<br>She appeared very restless, and was itching to snatch the key from Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>However, she did not do so. Instead, she stared at the key covetingly.<br>She looked slightly laughable, and slightly pitiful.<br>&ldquo;Young master, I truly do not understand what you&rsquo;re implying.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If young master is unwilling to release A&rsquo;li from this place, A&rsquo;li is willing to follow young master and recognize him as A&rsquo;li&rsquo;s master,&rdquo; she said.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need you to follow me,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Then could young master release me?&rdquo; asked A&rsquo;li.<br>&ldquo;Release you? That&rsquo;s not an issue at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once you hand over this place&rsquo;s treasure, I will release you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng suddenly stopped and stared at that A&rsquo;li.<br>&ldquo;Treasure?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young master, I am the treasure of this place,&rdquo; said A&rsquo;li.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll be leaving.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since young lady has stayed in this place for all these years, you shouldn&rsquo;t mind continuing to wait.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he turned around and began walking out.<br>&ldquo;Young master, please wait.&rdquo;<br>A&rsquo;li started to panic upon seeing that. She immediately extended her hand and grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s clothes.<br>When Chu Feng turned around, A&rsquo;li was actually kneeling before him.<br>&ldquo;A&rsquo;li was wrong. A&rsquo;li shouldn&rsquo;t have attempted to fool young master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that the treasure of this place has been accompanying me since the moment I woke up.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I no longer remember how long I&rsquo;ve been in this place. All this time, there has not been anyone accompanying me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They were the only ones accompanying me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To me, they are all beings with a spiritual nature. They are all my friends.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could I possibly give my friends to someone else?&rdquo; A&rsquo;li said with a look of pain.<br>Her eyes were actually dripping with tears as she said those words.<br>Her grievance-filled look was truly a painful sight to bear.<br>&ldquo;You said you&rsquo;ve been here all by yourself for many years, and ended up considering the treasures of this place to be your friends. That I can understand.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the important matter is that they did not belong to you to begin with.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those treasures should belong to me now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Regardless of what your justification is, you should not appropriate things to yourself that rightfully belong to others.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should be handing them over to me. That is the mission that the master of this place gave you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Yes, young master is correct.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A&rsquo;li is slow-witted. I didn&rsquo;t understand young master earlier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After hearing what young master said, A&rsquo;li finally came to a realization.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young master, I&rsquo;ll hand all of these to you.&rdquo;<br>As A&rsquo;li spoke, she placed her hand into her bosom and took out dozens of items in succession.<br>This completely stupefied Chu Feng.<br>It would be one thing if those items were all relatively small.<br>However, among them was an enormous cauldron over a dozen meters in height.<br>In the blink of an eye, the room was covered in items.<br>From this, Chu Feng could imagine that the insides of A&rsquo;li&rsquo;s long skirt contained some sort of treasure akin to a Cosmos Sack. Otherwise, how could she conceal all those treasures?<br>Among the treasures were fans, bottle gourds, bowls and a sword composed of woven coins.<br>However, not a single one of them was a weapon. They were all treasures with special powers.<br>Every single one could be said to be invaluable. Most importantly, the great majority of them emitted the Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura.<br>Most of the treasures from the Ancient Era were completely tattered.<br>Yet, those treasures were like new. Chu Feng could tell that they had been very well-maintained.<br>However, at the same time, he felt somewhat strange.<br>The fox spirit emitted the Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura from her body. This meant that she was a monster that had existed since the Ancient Era.<br>She was not someone that had appeared after the Ancient Era. Rather, she was someone who had lived in the Ancient Era.<br>Logically, the stone case should also be from the Ancient Era.<br>However, it just so happened that the treasures that this fox spirit took out, although they were all invaluable, not all of them emitted an Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura.<br>A portion of them did not possess the Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura.<br>This meant that some of those treasures were not from the Ancient Era.<br>But, they should all be treasures from the Ancient Era.<br>Because of this, Chu Feng was momentarily confused.<br>He felt that the situation was rather strange and fishy.<br>&ldquo;Young master, you must treat my friends well,&rdquo; said A&rsquo;li.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, there&rsquo;s still the most important item that you&rsquo;ve yet to hand over.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once you hand that over, I will release you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no more. Young master, I&rsquo;ve truly taken out all the treasures. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, you can search me,&rdquo; A&rsquo;li said with a serious expression.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making things difficult for me here. We&rsquo;re of different sexes, how could I possibly search young lady&rsquo;s body?&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>&ldquo;In that case, young master does not have to do the searching. You can look instead.&rdquo;<br>As A&rsquo;li spoke, she actually removed her long skirt.<br>Chu Feng did not avoid her body. Just like that, he stared at her.<br>The reason why he was so determined that A&rsquo;li still had a treasure on her was because of his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>Although Chu Feng was unable to see through A&rsquo;li&rsquo;s long skirt, he could see that she still had a hidden aura on her body. It was a treasure&rsquo;s aura.<br>After A&rsquo;li took off her long skirt and stood before Chu Feng completely naked, Chu Feng gasped with surprise.<br>He was shocked to discover that A&rsquo;li not only had a beautiful face, but she also had beautiful curves.<br>That said, he was also somewhat puzzled. Even though A&rsquo;li had clearly removed her clothes, even though there was nothing on her anymore, Chu Feng was still able to see the aura of a treasure with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>&lsquo;Could it be that she&rsquo;s hiding it within her body?&rsquo;<br>With this thought in his mind, Chu Feng began to examine her with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes. He wanted to see through her flesh and into her internal organs.<br>However, it just so happened that Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes were unable to see through A&rsquo;li&rsquo;s skin.<br>One should know that Chu Feng, even without using his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, could see through ordinary objects with his eyes.<br>The penetration ability of his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes was extremely powerful. Many treasures were unable to obstruct Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>Yet, it just so happened that he was unable to see through A&rsquo;li&rsquo;s skin.<br>This made Chu Feng realize that it was not only the removed long skirt that was extraordinary; this fox spirit before him herself was extraordinary.<br>At the moment when Chu Feng was seriously examining A&rsquo;li&rsquo;s body, A&rsquo;li&rsquo;s voice sounded, &ldquo;Young master, how much longer are you going to look?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say that you&rsquo;re not fond of women?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you don&rsquo;t like women, why is your body&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng immediately coughed a couple times. Then, he turned around to conceal his embarrassment.<br>Chu Feng knew what A&rsquo;li was talking about.<br>After all, he was a man, and a normal man on top of that. As for A&rsquo;li, she was such a beautiful young woman.<br>As such, Chu Feng gave off a very normal reaction. Merely, he had not expected A&rsquo;li to discover his reaction.<br>Sure enough, a fox spirit was different. Even something like that was discovered by her.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, go ahead and get dressed,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, A&rsquo;li actually and immediately put her long skirt back on.<br>&ldquo;Young master, do you believe A&rsquo;li now?&rdquo; A&rsquo;li asked as she looked at Chu Feng with a blushing face.<br></p></div>
