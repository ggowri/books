        <h1>Chapter 4319</h1>
        <div> - Milord<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were several people standing not far away.<br>Among those people was a young man that Chu Feng recognized. His name was Long Nanxun.<br>This Long Nanxun could be said to be Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s subordinate. Chu Feng met him when Long Xiaoxiao requested for his help.<br>At the beginning, Long Nanxun was filled with hostility toward Chu Feng. But, after Long Nanxun, Long Xiaoxiao and others were nearly killed by the All-seeing Heavenly Master and were rescued by Chu Feng, he eased his hostility toward Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng never imagined that he would meet him again today and in such a situation on top of that.<br>When Chu Feng saw Long Nanxun, Long Nanxun nodded his head at Chu Feng. Chu Feng smiled in response.<br>From that simple exchange, Chu Feng knew that Long Nanxun was most likely standing on his side today.<br>Thinking bad about how Long Nanxun created all sorts of troubles for him during their first meeting, Chu Feng sighed with emotions.<br>Then, Long Nanxun&rsquo;s gaze grew sharp. He looked to the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s guard that had already walked over to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Impudent! Our clan is currently recruiting powerful world spiritists, how could you all obstruct them?!&rdquo; Long Nanxun criticized that guard.<br>&ldquo;Young master Nanxun, this subordinate was wrong,&rdquo; The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s guard that was intending to make things difficult for Chu Feng immediately kneeled before Long Nanxun.<br>The other guards were also terrified and confused.<br>From that, one could determine that Long Nanxun must also possess an extraordinary status within the Dragon Clan. Else, those guards wouldn&rsquo;t become that terrified.<br>After all, Chu Feng could tell that those Dragon Clan&rsquo;s guards were not weak at all.<br>&ldquo;Long Nanxun, you couldn&rsquo;t blame them for that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While our Dragon Clan is seeking out world spiritists right now, the announcements clearly indicated that we only sought for powerful world spiritists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is obvious that those two are only here to pass long for the rewards. Isn&rsquo;t it only proper for us to refuse them instead?&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, another voice was heard.<br>That voice also came from a young man. This young man had the appearance of a pretty boy.<br>But, from his treacherous appearance, one could form from a single glance that he was someone wicked.<br>Standing together with Long Nanxun, he likely arrived here together with Long Nanxun. As such, one could guess that he was also someone with an extraordinary status.<br>&ldquo;Young master Nanxun, what young master Pingfeng said is extremely correct. It is not that this subordinate was looking down upon them. This subordinate was just doing things according to the instructions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The lords had left behind a register of names for us. Only those on the registry are allowed to enter our Dragon Clan,&rdquo; said the guard kneeling on the ground.<br>&ldquo;That person over there is my friend. His world spirit techniques are extremely powerful. He might be able to help us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if he&rsquo;s not on the registry, you should still treat him as a distinguished guest,&rdquo; said Long Nanxun.<br>&ldquo;Extremely powerful?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heh. Long Nanxun, since when did you become acquainted with trash like that?&rdquo; mocked the young man by the name of Long Pingfeng.<br>&ldquo;Long Pingfeng, have you ever heard of the phrase &lsquo;there are people more talented that you in the wider world?&rsquo;&rdquo; asked Long Nanxun.<br>&ldquo;Grandmasters, do any of you recognize those two?&rdquo;<br>Long Pingfeng was unwilling to accept. He looked to the people behind him. THey were all old men wearing world spiritist gowns.<br>&ldquo;Young master Long, we&rsquo;ve traveled extensively and have participated in multiple gatherings of world spiritists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not trying to boast here but we&rsquo;ve met all the reputed world spiritists in the Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve even met the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, Grandmaster Tang Chen, Grandmaster Luo Tuo, Celestial Fairy Muzhi and the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, we&rsquo;ve never met those two. May we know whose disciples the two of you are?&rdquo;<br>An monkey-faced looking old man among the group of world spiritists turned to ask Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist with a beaming smile.<br>Ridicule filled his gaze. It was as if Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist were merely clowns in his eyes.<br>Chu Feng does not wish to tolerate this sort of behavior. He was planning to speak when a hand suddenly landed on his shoulder. It was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>After taking a glance at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Chu Feng decided to not say anything.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s abilities surpass Chu Feng&rsquo;s wildest imagination. Before him, those people were the actual clowns.<br>As such, Chu Feng wanted to see how his master would handle the situation before them.<br>&ldquo;Forgive this old man for speaking forthrightly. Unfortunately, you all are not qualified to speak with me,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist with a beaming smile.<br>He not only took a glance at those world spiritists, he also took a glance at that Long Pingfeng.<br>That glance completely infuriated Long Pingfeng.<br>&ldquo;What did you say?! You dared say that we&rsquo;re not qualified to speak to you?!&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, Long Pingfeng burst into range. He pointed at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and questioned angrily.<br>&ldquo;This old man came here today with the intention of helping your Dragon Clan. I did not come here so that you all can make things difficult for me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend, this old man doesn&rsquo;t care what your status might not. But, I&rsquo;d like to offer you a word of advice.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man is no hypocrite. I am a truly vile character.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am someone who will always take revenge. Thus, I&rsquo;d urge you to speak politely when speaking with me. It will not do any harm to you. If you refuse to do so&hellip; tsk, tsk.&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist smiled. His smile was so profound. It was as if that Long Pingfeng refused to exercise restraint, he would court a major disaster upon himself.<br>But, Long Pingfeng believed Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to be the actual clowns.<br>How could he tolerate clowns acting so impudent toward him?<br>&ldquo;Audacious zealot, you dared behave so atrociously in our Dragon Clan&rsquo;s territory?! Men! Arrest them!&rdquo; shouted Long Pingfeng angrily.<br>&ldquo;They are my close friends! Who dare touch them?!&rdquo; Long Nanxun also shouted.<br>&ldquo;I, Long Pingfeng, will back you all up. Princess Mumu will back you all up. I shall see who would dare to stop you all from making that arrest!&rdquo; shouted Long Pingfeng.<br>Hearing those words, the hesitant Dragon Clan&rsquo;s guards immediately made their resolve.<br>&ldquo;Clank, clank, clank---&rdquo;<br>They all unsheathed their weapons and began to walk toward the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>While Long Nanxun possessed a special status, Long Pingfeng&rsquo;s status was equally special.<br>Mainly, it comes down to how the two of them were both backed by princesses.<br>Long Pingfeng was close to Princess Mumu whereas Long Nanxun was close to Princess Xiaoxiao.<br>Those two princesses were both treasured by the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>In recent days, the two princesses&rsquo; mothers had fought violently. That was something known to everyone in the Dragon Clan.<br>But now, the outcome has been determined. The victors of that fight were Princess Mumu and her mother.<br>Not only did Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother lose her favor, Princess Xiaoxiao herself also lost the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s favor.<br>Comparing the lackyes of the two princesses, it was obvious to the guards who to listen to.<br>&ldquo;I shall see who dares to touch them!&rdquo;<br>Long Nanxun arrived before Chu Feng and unleashed his oppressive might. He shielded Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist with his own strength.<br>&ldquo;Arrest him too!&rdquo; ordered Long Pingfeng.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Milord!&rdquo;<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s guards actually really began to proceed toward Long Nanxun.<br>&ldquo;Cease your hands!&rdquo;<br>But, right at this moment, an aged voice sounded.<br>Looking over, a golden cloud was drifting over from afar. There were several figures standing on that cloud.<br>Those people were standing with their hands behind their back. Every one of them gave off extraordinary auras. It was like they were celestial immortals.<br>They were all the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elders.<br>&ldquo;I pay my respect to Lord Supreme Elders!&rdquo;<br>Seeing those Supreme Elders, the blustering Long Pingfeng immediately kneeled onto the ground and bowed to them.<br>The other Dragon Clansmen, including Long Nanxun, also did the same.<br>At this moment, Long Nanxun started to frown.<br>If the guards were all, he would not be worried.<br>But, if those Supreme Elders were planning to back up Long Pingfeng, he would not be able to do anything.<br>But, right at this moment, an astonishing scene occurred.<br>After those Supreme Elders landed, they did not bother to pay any attention to Long Pingfeng, Long Nanxun or the guards. Instead, they directly walked over to Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, Milord, so you&rsquo;ve come?&rdquo;<br>Those Supreme Elders were extremely excited to see the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. It was so much that their eyes were shining. They had the looks of people seeing their savior.<br>Hearing the words spoken by the Supreme Elders, Long Nanxun and others were all bewildered.<br>As for Long Pingfeng, his expression turned ashen. He realized that things had turned very bad for him.<br></p></div>
