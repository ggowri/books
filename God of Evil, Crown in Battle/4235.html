        <h1>Chapter 4234</h1>
        <div> - His Name Is Chu Feng<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;A random treasure allocated according to one&rsquo;s desire is already this powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This Ancient Compliance Castle is truly remarkable. It&rsquo;s no wonder there are so many people that want to enter this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also no wonder that there were people that wanted to obtain the Ancient Compliance Castle for themselves.&rdquo;<br>Even though Chu Feng already knew that the Ancient Compliance Castle was amazing, he was still shocked by the efficacy of the medicinal pellet.<br>He had never heard of a medicinal pellet that was so powerful.<br>The Ancient Compliance Castle had existed for many years. Countless people had stood before the Compliance Mirror.<br>If all those people had encountered treasures that fancied their interest, then exactly how many treasures were there in the Ancient Compliance Castle?<br>Furthermore, what sort of quality treasures were those?<br>It was truly a place that one would become very curious about, a place that could stir up greed in one&rsquo;s heart.<br>&ldquo;Yu Sha, did your cultivation manage to increase?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng felt that Yu Sha must&rsquo;ve increased her cultivation through the closed-door training.<br>&ldquo;Rank one Utmost Exalted,&rdquo; replied Yu Sha.<br>&ldquo;Rank one Utmost Exalted?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Girl, you&rsquo;ve made quite a bit of progress. Judging from this, it was worth it for you to spend all that time in closed-door training.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt very happy.<br>Yu Sha&rsquo;s cultivation had surpassed his expectations.<br>After all, Chu Feng was only a rank one Utmost Exalted himself.<br>Yu Sha being able to gain this level of cultivation would also serve as a huge assistance to him.<br>After all, she was no ordinary world spirit. Her heaven-defying battle power was terrifying.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s motion outside.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Girl, I&rsquo;ll go out and have a look. I&rsquo;ll come back to reminisce with you later.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng said those words, he immediately cast his consciousness back into his own body.<br>It was only then that he discovered that the gaseous flames that had been blocking the crowd&rsquo;s vision had dissipated.<br>Chu Feng was finally visible to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br>When the crowd saw Chu Feng, the great majority of them revealed confused expressions.<br>The person they were expecting was Lu Jie.<br>But, the person that had appeared was a stranger.<br>This made them extremely puzzled, so much so that they weren&rsquo;t even certain if Chu Feng was the person that had breached the Hidden Gate.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him?&rdquo;<br>Right when the majority of the crowd were confused, some people recognized Chu Feng.<br>Yue Yang and Chen Guang were amongst them.<br>But, compared to the others, the shock on their faces was even stronger.<br>After all, their previous encounter with Chu Feng was still vivid in their minds.<br>That day, Chu Feng had been requested by Long Xiaoxiao to aid her. On that day, they had thought Chu Feng to be a genius world spiritist.<br>After all, Long Xiaoxiao had praised Chu Feng extravagantly.<br>But, they were astonished by what had happened.<br>Not only had Chu Feng been unable to release his spirit power, he hadn't even dared to call out his world spirit.<br>Because of that, they'd thought Chu Feng to be a scammer, so much so that Chu Feng&rsquo;s name had become an object of ridicule for them after that day. From time to time, they would tell others about that ridiculous individual called Chu Feng.<br>But, the person they were laughing at should be a swindler, trash, a useless fellow.<br>How could someone like that be able to find the Hidden Gate?<br>As matters stood, they couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder if they had underestimated the fellow by the name of Chu Feng.<br>Could it be that he had truly encountered some sort of difficulty, and had been unable to use his world spirit techniques?<br>Or perhaps he wasn&rsquo;t the person who had opened the Hidden Gate at all?<br>It might also be possible that he had opened the Hidden Gate by sheer luck.<br>Yue Yang and Chen Guang were making nonstop guesses.<br>&ldquo;He&hellip; he&rsquo;s still alive?!&rdquo;<br>Compared to Yue Yang and Chen Guang, there was a person who was not only shocked, but also terrified.<br>That person was Li Fengxue.<br>Not only did he know Chu Feng, he also knew what Chu Feng should&rsquo;ve encountered.<br>That day, Chu Feng had received the Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain from his master.<br>Hidden inside those two Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain were Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects, absolutely fatal things.<br>Those insects had been purchased by his master using a great amount of wealth, all so that he could protect the Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain and make those that touched his Incomplete Maps suffer a miserable death.<br>The reason why those Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects cost so much was because they were no ordinary poison. Contained within their bodies were spirit formations.<br>Their spirit formations were extremely dreadful. Unless one was a Martial Exalted-level expert, they would definitely be killed by the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects without exception.<br>&lsquo;Could it be that those Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects had been discovered ahead of time, and had not entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s body?&rsquo;<br>Even though Li Fengxue felt that Chu Feng shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to avoid the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects, he could only guess that Chu Feng had been aided by Grandmaster Tang Chen, and had managed to avoid being affected by the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects after seeing how Chu Feng stood before him completely unscathed.<br>&lsquo;That old fart Tang Chen is truly quite skillful.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;But, if he avoided the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects, why is Yuan Shu acting so hostile toward me, like he&rsquo;s planning to kill me?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Yuan Shu is actually someone who holds a grudge this much?&rsquo;<br>Li Fengxue&rsquo;s brows narrowed. He felt that things were amiss, but was unable to tell what was amiss.<br>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br>Compared to Chen Guang, Yue Yang and Li Fengxue, the others were all filled with curiosity toward Chu Feng.<br>The expressions were slightly complicated. There was seriousness, reverence and even disapproval in their eyes.<br>The praises that they'd been shouting earlier had all disappeared.<br>Evidently, for the majority of them, Chu Feng, a stranger, opening the Hidden Gate was something they could not accept.<br>At that moment, Yuan Shu spoke, &ldquo;His name is Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng? Whose disciple is he? How come I&rsquo;ve never heard of him before?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Brother Yuan Shu, you know this man?&rdquo;<br>The crowd all began to question Yuan Shu.<br>As Yuan Shu was Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s disciple, he already enjoyed a great reputation, and was known to those people .<br>His strength had also gained the acknowledgement of most people. As such, the people present believed in his words.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s naturally a disciple from a famous teacher. As for whose disciple he is, you all will come to learn that in the future.&rdquo;<br>With a smile on his face, Yuan Shu began deliberately beating around the bush.<br>His actions had successfully caught the crowd&rsquo;s interest.<br>After hearing Yuan Shu&rsquo;s introduction, the crowd&rsquo;s opinion of Chu Feng had also changed somewhat.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a figure appeared deep within the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>It was an old man wearing a plain cotton gown.<br>The old man&rsquo;s hair and beard were both gray.<br>His hair was very fluffy, like a lion&rsquo;s mane.<br>Even his beard was puffed out.<br>Due to his fluffy hair and beard, one could only see a very small amount of his face.<br>Only his eyes could be seen most vividly.<br>But, his eyes appeared to be extremely tired and sleepy. They lacked spirit completely.<br>His outfit and appearance made him resemble a beggar.<br>However, once that person appeared, the people of the younger generation present immediately bowed respectfully toward him.<br>The reason for that was because he was the master of the place they were in. He was Old Man Compliance.<br></p></div>
