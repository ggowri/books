        <h1>Chapter 4617</h1>
        <div>: I Thought You Wanted To Do a Good Deed?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While a huge wall stood behind Chu Feng&rsquo;s back, sealing off his path of retreat, he found a complicated labyrinth sitting right before him. His surroundings were rather dark, which made him feel like he was navigating inside an underground labyrinth.<br>However, what Chu Feng was the most concerned about was that he noticed that his martial power had been sealed once more. In this palace, one could only rely on one&rsquo;s spirit power.<br>Chu Feng knew that Xia Yan and Xiao Yu would look for him, but he had no plans of standing still and waiting for them to come to him. Thus, he began scanning his surroundings closely.<br>Xia Yan and Xiao Yu had only chosen to work together with him as an act of desperation; it would be foolish to think that the two of them were truly trustworthy. If he wanted to survive in a place like this, he would have to depend on himself,<br>&ldquo;This feeling&hellip; are you finally willing to help me now?&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, Chu Feng felt a bizarre movement. His lips crept up ever so slightly, but his heart was filled with ravenous joy.<br>It was the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk. The treasure was finally reacting once again!<br>Chu Feng knew that he could count on it to help him whenever it showed some sort of peculiar reaction. Its prowess never disappointed him on such occasions.<br>Usually, the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk could only boost his spirit power slightly, making it not much of a treasure. However, as long as it took its own initiative to offer him his help, he would be able to clinch the upper hand in any challenges or crises he faced.<br>In fact, he had even once used the powers of the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk to fend against Martial Exalted level cultivators.<br>In truth, Chu Feng was still rather uncertain when he first entered the palace. Given that his martial power was sealed, putting aside the monstrously talented Gongsun Yuntian, he could easily be done in by any of the rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritists of the Gongsun Clan.<br>As such, the reaction of the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk was truly a huge boost of confidence. In his current state, he felt that he could stand against even Gongsun Yuntian if needed to. This was its true prowess.<br>Chu Feng quickly grasped the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk tightly in his grasp, and he immediately felt powerful energy surging into his body in the next moment. His eyes became particularly bright, allowing him to see through the walls within a certain radius around him. He could also make out the leylines of the formations, which allowed him to deduce where hidden formation traps were located.<br>All in all, his ability to perceive his surroundings had been enhanced multiple fold.<br>However, this wasn&rsquo;t the most frightening of all. Chu Feng actually felt wave after wave of energy surging in from the surroundings into his body.<br>This energy came from the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace itself.<br>To phrase it in qualitative terms, he was pretty much invincible at the moment even without relying on his special skills, for the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk was helping him gain control over the energy of the palace itself.<br>&ldquo;Woah, you sure are obedient. You actually waited here for us to find you without taking a step at all!&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan&rsquo;s voice suddenly sounded right ahead.<br>There was another person standing beside him when he appeared, and that person was no other than Xiao Yu. The two of them had already come together with one another earlier on.<br>&ldquo;Like I told you before, since someone is offering his thighs for me to hug, I&rsquo;ll make sure to clutch onto it tightly,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a laugh.<br>&ldquo;Bro, you have good eyes. Don&rsquo;t worry, nothing will go wrong as long as you follow me well!&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan patted Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulders before leading the way forth.<br>&ldquo;Brother Xia Yan, you have been here before? Or is there a map on this place?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Chu Feng realized that Xia Yan had been moving forward without any hesitation, as if he already had a clear path in mind. Their group had encountered many forks in the path along the way, and there were even intersections with over several hundred paths to choose from. Yet, Xia Yan simply continued marching forward without bothering to take a closer look.<br>And Chu Feng was right. Xia Yan did know where they had to go.<br>&ldquo;Bro, since we&rsquo;re working together with one another now, I shall be honest with you. This is my first time in the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace, but I did make sure to gather information on it beforehand.<br>&ldquo;In fact, my very goal for participating in the matchmaking convention is not the Wretched Black Demon&rsquo;s granddaughter but the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace. I was betting that the Wretched Black Demon would bring the palace out for the matchmaking convention.<br>&ldquo;So, you can rest easy about this. Since you&rsquo;re working with me, I&rsquo;ll make sure that you don&rsquo;t return empty-handed!&rdquo; Xia Yan told Chu Feng confidently.<br>&ldquo;What about you then?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to Xiao Yu and asked.<br>&ldquo;All I want is the Illusory Palace Soulwater. You can take everything else,&rdquo; Xiao Yu replied nonchalantly.<br>His words were directed not just toward Chu Feng but Xia Yan too.<br>&ldquo;Illusory Palace Soulwater? What is that? Is it a cultivation resource?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>However, Xiao Yu didn&rsquo;t respond, so Chu Feng could only turn to Xia Yan for an answer.<br>It was interesting how different Xia Yan and Xiao Yu&rsquo;s personalities were from one another. Xiao Yu was an extremely cold and reticent individual whereas Xia Yan was a warm-hearted and loose-lipped fellow.<br>And not betraying Chu Feng&rsquo;s expectations, as soon as he sensed Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze, Xia Yan answered the question.<br>&ldquo;Well, the Illusory Palace Soulwater is an interesting item. There were many prodigious young world spiritists who have entered the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace prior to us, and one of them noticed an object that looks like an ordinary jade bottle, just that it has the words &lsquo;Illusory Palace Soulwater on it. It contains a fluid that emanates a slight fragrance.<br>&ldquo;The prodigy who stumbled upon it wasn&rsquo;t a careless person. He first observed the item carefully and ascertained that it wasn&rsquo;t anything harmful, so he concluded that it was a cultivation resource. So, the next time that he encountered a bottleneck in his cultivation, he drank it right away. However, it was then that something bizarre happened.&rdquo;<br>It was at this point that Xia Yan turned to look at Chu Feng and teased, &ldquo;So, what do you think happened?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That fellow&rsquo;s soul escaped from his physical body, and he found that his soul was no longer compatible with his body anymore, resulting in his inability to return to his body. As a result, he was only able to travel around as a soul.<br>&ldquo;If it was just that much, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a huge cause of concern. What was worse was that he was unable to exert any of his powers, and that really frightened him. So, he thought of seeking help from one of the friends he had met and entered the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace with.<br>&ldquo;To his astonishment, his friend couldn&rsquo;t hear anything he said at all. He tried approaching his friend, but his friend couldn&rsquo;t see him either. In fact, his friend simply walked right past him as if he was transparent. It was also then that the second bizarre thing happened.<br>&ldquo;He actually entered a body, but it was not his own but his friend&rsquo;s! That was not all to it. He found that he was in full control of his friend&rsquo;s soul and powers as well! His friend was still alive, but everything of his friend had become his,&rdquo; Xia Yan said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such a mysterious power in the world?&rdquo; Chu Feng was astonished.<br>This made him realize just how frightening and dangerous the Illusory Palace Soulwater was.<br>&ldquo;So, the Illusory Palace Soulwater is an item used for possession.&rdquo;<br>After explaining the use of the item, Xia Yan turned to Xiao Yu and asked, &ldquo;Brother Xiao Yu, I reckon that you aren&rsquo;t trying to obtain that item to do as good deed, are you?&rdquo;<br>And this was the same question that Chu Feng wanted to ask as well.<br></p></div>
