        <div> - A Sinister Laugh<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Everyone was startled by Chu Feng&rsquo;s acceptance of the conditions.<br>It was not because they felt that Chu Feng would definitely lose.<br>This was especially true for the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and the others. They all knew how strong Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques were.<br>They felt that Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques were very strong, that even though he had only just become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, he possessed the strength to compete against Daoist Gold Star.<br>They were only feeling confused because they felt that Daoist Gold Star&rsquo;s demands were truly irrational. Yet, Chu Feng had actually agreed to them.<br>In this sort of situation, the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui involuntarily glanced at one another.<br>After glancing at one another, they seemed to have reached a mutual understanding. They then looked to Chu Feng. The confusion in their eyes had disappeared and was replaced with admiration.<br>They both felt a possibility. That was that Chu Feng had dared to agree to those demands because he possessed the certainty of absolute victory. At the very least, he was very confident in himself.<br>It was precisely because of the confidence that Chu Feng possessed that the two grand characters felt admiration for Chu Feng.<br>They felt that the young needed that sort of drive.<br>&ldquo;This is truly what they meant by a newborn calf not being afraid of tigers. Since you have decided, we can start,&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star said.<br>&ldquo;Very well, how do you want to compete?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;How to compete? We shall fight with world spirit techniques until one is defeated,&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star said.<br>&ldquo;Until one is defeated? What sort of &lsquo;defeat&rsquo; do you mean?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It means me beating you to a state of being unable to fight back,&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re planning to use world spirit techniques to compete in an actual battle against Chu Feng?&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley master and the other spectators all revealed astonished expressions.<br>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star nodded.<br>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t really fair, no?&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master asked.<br>&ldquo;How is it not fair?&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star asked coldly.<br>&ldquo;Your cultivation is, after all, that of a rank six Martial Ancestor, whereas little friend Chu Feng is only a rank four Half Martial Ancestor. With how enormous the difference in your cultivations is, how could the two of you possibly battle with world spirit techniques?&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master said.<br>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star smiled lightly. He said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something that you all are ignorant about. I am going to use world spirit techniques to fight against him. I am not using my martial power. So why would my cultivation possibly matter?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Su Jingrui said, &ldquo;Everyone knows that a world spiritist&rsquo;s cultivation directly decides the strength of a world spiritist. After all, a world spiritist will also need a powerful build.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although we are not Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, we are, after all, Royal-cloak World Spiritists. As such, we know about that sort of thing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So what? It is he who wants to challenge me. Are you saying that I cannot utilize my advantage?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, I might as well not compete. I&rsquo;ll just admit defeat, okay? After all, no matter what I do, you&rsquo;ll all say that I&rsquo;m the one in the wrong. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo; After Daoist Gold Star finished saying those words, he looked to the Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s headmaster and said, &ldquo;Headmaster Ouyang, how about we just leave? After all, it seems that your two old friends are unable to take a defeat with grace.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s headmaster had a wry smile on his face. He actually also deeply disliked Daoist Gold Star&rsquo;s attitude.<br>However, it remained that Daoist Gold Star was someone that he requested help from. Furthermore, he had exhausted a great amount of effort in order to invite Daoist Gold Star here.<br>At that moment, he was placed in a very difficult situation because he did not wish to offend either side.<br>&ldquo;It turns out, only I alone am an outsider. You&rsquo;re also with them,&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star was able to see through the attitude of the Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s headmaster. Thus, he felt increasingly angry and displeasure filled his face.<br>In response, the Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s headmaster hurriedly tried to explain. &ldquo;Brother Gold Star, you&rsquo;re overthinking things. How could you be an outsider? This is merely a friendly spar. It&rsquo;s not as serious as you think it is.&rdquo;<br>However, before he could finish, Daoist Gold Star laughed coldly. Then, he said, &ldquo;Ouyang Yuqing, you know best why I agreed to come here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I did not fancy the rewards that you gave me. Instead, it was because I, Gold Star, and your Three Stars Hall both possessed the word &lsquo;star.&rsquo; As such, I considered it fate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was because of that fate that I decided to help you. Else, did you really think that bit of reward you gave me would be enough to make an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist help you?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s headmaster revealed a displeased expression. He said, &ldquo;Gold Star, are your words not too excessive?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You have not come here for free. It was also you who declared how much you wanted to be paid. Furthermore, I had already given you your rewards.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet now, you are actually saying those things to me? Do you really think it is appropriate?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To put it pleasantly, I have requested your presence here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, to put it bluntly, you were merely hired by me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is there someone who speaks to an employer the way you&rsquo;re speaking to me?&rdquo;<br>Anger. The Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s Headmaster&rsquo;s tone was filled with anger. Furthermore, it was also very imposing.<br>He had revealed all of the displeasure he felt earlier.<br>&ldquo;Pah! I gave you face, and you really considered yourself to be someone grand?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is your pay. Today, your daddy I will return it to you. From this point on, your daddy I am not related to you in the slightest.&rdquo;<br>Daoist Gold Star was truly not someone to be trifled with. He took out a Cosmos Sack and tossed it at the Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>As for the Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s Headmaster, he was not one to be polite either. Not only did he receive the Cosmos Sack, he also opened it to check its contents carefully.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s missing twenty Incomplete Ancestral Armaments,&rdquo; The Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s Headmaster said.<br>&ldquo;I have accompanied you here and wasted a lot of my time. Those twenty Incomplete Ancestral Armaments are my compensation,&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star said.<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you declare earlier that you didn&rsquo;t care about this bit of reward? That you&rsquo;ve come here because of fate? Why is there a compensation fee now?&rdquo; Su Jingrui mocked.<br>At that moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and the others present, even Chu Feng and the others of the younger generation, started to sneer.<br>While Daoist Gold Star might appear to be an extraordinary individual, he was actually extremely petty. He was indeed someone to be sneered at.<br>&ldquo;Good, very good.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Three Stars Hall, Sunset Cloud Valley, I, Daoist Gold Star, will remember you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You all will soon know the consequences for going against me, Daoist Gold Star, are.&rdquo;<br>Daoist Gold Star&rsquo;s expression began to distort. However, in the end, he still took out twenty Incomplete Ancestral Armaments and tossed them at the Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>Upon seeing the twenty Incomplete Ancestral Armaments, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart started to move. The reason for that was because those twenty Incomplete Ancestral Armaments were all of extraordinary quality.<br>They could be said to be top quality Incomplete Ancestral Armaments. In fact, their quality even slightly surpassed Chu Feng&rsquo;s Magma Emperor Sword.<br>It was no wonder Daoist Gold Star would return everything but keep the twenty Incomplete Ancestral Armaments.<br>&ldquo;I will not bother seeing you off then,&rdquo; The Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s headmaster said after putting the twenty Incomplete Ancestral Armaments away.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for you all to see me off,&rdquo; Daoist Gold Star snorted coldly. Then, he waved his sleeve and prepared to swagger off.<br>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly said, &ldquo;Why are you leaving? Could it be that you are afraid of competing?&rdquo;<br>Daoist Gold Star stopped his footsteps. He turned around and asked, &ldquo;What? You still want to compete against me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I never declared that I would not compete with you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Hah&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing what Chu Feng said, that Daoist Gold Star burst into laughter. Merely, his laughter was very sinister. It caused one to shiver upon hearing it.<br><br></p></div>
