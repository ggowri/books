        <div> - Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng and Long Daozhi had arrived at the Heaven-devouring Starfield.<br>However, they were still in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Teleportation Formation. They had taken the teleportation channel in order to continue towards their destination: the Immortal-bestowment Upper Realm.<br>The Immortal-bestowment Upper Realm was the location where Long Daozhi and the other four fellow clansmen-led powers had agreed to meet.<br>[1. Just noticed, if there are 4 stones, how will it be split among 5 powers?]<br>For the sake of increasing their speed, Long Daozhi used a special war chariot inside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formation. That war chariot greatly increased their speed.<br>Suddenly, the war chariot started to shake.<br>Even the palace hall inside the war chariot used for resting started to tremble violently.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng, who had been training with his eyes closed, immediately opened his eyes.<br>As a world spiritist, he had a bad feeling.<br>But, Long Daozhi was still sitting. There was no trace of panic on his face at all.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you don&rsquo;t have to worry. We merely encountered a fluctuation within the teleportation formation. It will soon stabilize itself,&rdquo; he explained.<br>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be that simple.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, please listen. There seems to be howls mixed in with the sound of the wind.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those howls are quite terrifying. Rarely have I heard such terrifying howling.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That means that the one howling must be an extremely powerful and arrogant sort of ferocious beast."<br>Chu Feng had already gotten up as he spoke, and looked ahead with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>The reason why he was looking ahead was because the wind that was violently shaking their war chariot came from ahead of them.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng had a very serious look on his face. However, after examining the situation he did not discover anything special.<br>This caused him to feel rather puzzled.<br>Their current situation was very strange.<br>There seemed to be danger approaching toward them. Yet, Chu Feng was unable to find any danger.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, the Heaven-devouring Starfield&rsquo;s Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formations are different from those of other places.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When fluctuations arise in this place, the incoming wind will be filled with those strange voices,&rdquo; said Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Oh? Why would there be such a change?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng curiously.<br>As a world spiritist, he was extremely knowledgeable of world spirit techniques.<br>Logically, all the Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formations in the Holy Light Galaxy should be identical.<br>Even if fluctuations were to occur inside a teleportation formation, their behavior should be the same. There shouldn&rsquo;t be a case that was different from the others.<br>Yet, what was occurring inside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formation&rsquo;s teleportation channel this time around was truly special.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you know why this place is called the Heaven-devouring Starfield?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because there was a sort of giant beast in this Heaven-devouring Starfield back in the Ancient Era. That beast was called the Heaven-devouring Beast.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for cultivators from our era, we address them as the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Reportedly, these Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts are extremely fond of cultivating inside Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As such, from time to time, even though they disappeared in the Ancient Era, one can hear their voices inside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formations,&rdquo; Long Daozhi explained.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, if they disappeared in the Ancient Era, how do the people here know about them?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Even though the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts have disappeared since the time of the Ancient Era, they left behind a lot of remains.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, the majority of those remains were fragments. There was only a single complete set of remains.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Through that set of remains, world spiritists managed to reconstruct the appearance of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While its appearance was reconstructed through world spirit techniques, perhaps because the set of remains was real, the reconstructed Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast, although fake, emits an imposing might not present in ordinary monsters.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even I feel incomparably small before it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I can only imagine just how powerful of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts were when they were alive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once we&rsquo;re done with our business here, I can bring young friend Chu Feng to have a look at the remains of that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps it might even be of aid to your training,&rdquo; said Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>He was very curious about the matters of the Ancient Era to begin with.<br>As such, he would naturally be curious about a creature that had played a role in the Ancient Era.<br>Even though Chu Feng had met quite a few creatures from the Ancient Era, he still wanted to learn more about a creature as powerful as the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, roars sounded from ahead.<br>Even the violent wind that engulfed them became even more intense.<br>&ldquo;Senior, were the fluctuations from earlier also like this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Even though he'd heard the roar from the very beginning, it was very vague. If one didn&rsquo;t pay close attention and use special observation methods, one simply wouldn't be able to hear the roar.<br>However, that roar was different.<br>The sound of the roar had covered the sound of the violent winds.<br>&ldquo;It is also the first time I&rsquo;ve heard a roar that loud.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Long Daozhi&rsquo;s face was no longer calm and composed. Instead, there was a faint amount of unease present on It.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng realized that things were bad when he saw Long Daozhi&rsquo;s reaction.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the rapidly moving war chariot came to a sudden stop.<br>Even though the flow of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formation was still pushing the war chariot forward, the war chariot was not moving.<br>The situation made both Long Daozhi and Chu Feng frown.<br>The two of them both walked out of the palace and arrived at the front of the war chariot.<br>They wanted to see exactly what sort of unforeseen event had occurred.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a giant pair of eyes appeared in the pitch-black teleportation channel ahead.<br>That giant pair of eyes emitted a red light that dyed the entire region blood-red.<br>Then, another roar was heard as a colossal monster appeared before the war chariot.<br>It was a giant beast over a hundred thousand meters in length.<br>Before the giant beast, even the war chariot appeared immensely small.<br>As for Chu Feng and Long Daozhi, they were akin to specks of dust.<br>Upon seeing the giant beast, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart immediately tensed up. From merely a single glance, he could tell just how terrifying the giant beast before him was.<br>The beast&rsquo;s eyes were blood-red, and its body was pitch-black. It had a head that resembled that of an alligator, and a body like a rhinoceros. On its back covered in black scales were two pairs of enormous wings that were several times larger than its body.<br>The winds created by the movement of the wings caused the war chariot to totter. It seemed as if it would be destroyed at any moment.<br>Most terrifying of all, the giant beast emitted an intense Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura.<br>As for its cultivation, it had reached an unfathomable level.<br>Before the giant beast, even Long Daozhi wore an expression of fear on his face.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that there are still living Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts inside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formations?&rdquo; Long Daozhi cried out in alarm.<br>&ldquo;Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, could this be the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast you mentioned?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was also very surprised after hearing Long Daozhi's words.<br>He had not met any Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts before. But, according to Long Daozhi, those giant and powerful ferocious beasts of the Ancient Era should&rsquo;ve been wiped out.<br>But, evidently, they had not been wiped out. After all, the legendary, powerful creature was alive and standing before them.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Before Chu Feng could think more about the situation, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast opened its mouth.<br>Accompanying its roar was an enormous suction force.<br>The suction power enveloped Chu Feng completely. He was simply unable to resist it in the slightest.<br>In the blink of an eye, he was sucked into the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast&rsquo;s mouth.<br>After devouring Chu Feng, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast actually turned around and disappeared.<br>When the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast disappeared, the war chariot moved on as normal. It continued to follow the flow of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formation&rsquo;s current and rapidly proceeded onward in the tunnel.<br>Everything returned to normal.<br>The strange violent wind had disappeared. The roars that were heard from the wind had also disappeared.<br>The war chariot was no longer shaking. Furthermore, it had not received much damage.<br>Yet, Chu Feng had disappeared.<br>Long Daozhi stood there in a completely dumbfounded manner. He only managed to slowly react to what had happened after a long time had passed.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The legendary Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast is still alive. Furthermore, it devoured young friend Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But&hellip; why would it spare me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that I am unqualified to become its meal?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; exactly what is going on here?!&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi was in a complete panic. With a complicated expression, he was completely puzzled.<br></p></div>
