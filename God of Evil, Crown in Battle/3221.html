        <div> - Showing Disdain For Everyone<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Li Anzhi&rsquo;s words had startled everyone present awake. At that moment, the crowd panicked completely.<br>They truly did not expect that after they&rsquo;d gone through all the hardships to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, they would still not be able to train at ease.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, it depends on who it is that&rsquo;s going back on their word.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, if we are to go back on our word, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen can very well take care of us for it. After all, they possess the strength to do so.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if it&rsquo;s the people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan that decide to go back on their word, what could we possibly do to them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that you all have the extravagant hope that the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen will care about their face, care about their reputation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If they truly cared about face, they would not have attempted to prevent us from entering the Holy Spirit Formation of Light the way they did earlier,&rdquo; Li Anzhi said.<br>&ldquo;Young master Li, according to you, won&rsquo;t the Linghu Heavenly Clan definitely deliberately make things difficult for us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What are we to do about this?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a blessing, it would not be misfortune. If it&rsquo;s misfortune, one will not be able to avoid it,&rdquo; Li Anzhi said.<br>Li Anzhi&rsquo;s words revealed to the crowd the situation they were in. He was telling them to prepare themselves to confront the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>However, the crowd were clearly undaring to confront the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>Panicked, someone turned to ask Chu Feng, &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, do you have any idea as to what we can do?&rdquo; Once that person questioned Chu Feng, everyone turned their eyes toward him.<br>The reason for that was because the only person that they felt to be capable of helping them at that moment was Chu Feng.<br>After all, it was Chu Feng who had summoned the Holy Spirit Formation of Light and breached the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s lightning formations to bring them here.<br>Moreover, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was also the strongest amongst them.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s rank nine Heavenly Immortal-level cultivation was sufficient to look down on countless heroes.<br>Even if there were also people with extraordinary strength among the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s newcomers, the crowd felt that they might not necessarily be stronger than Chu Feng.<br>In other words, the crowd felt that Chu Feng was able to protect them.<br>As such, the crowd all felt that they might be able to safely avoid this crisis should Chu Feng be willing to help them.<br>As for Chu Feng, he was originally not concerned with the conversations of the crowd. The reason for that was because he already knew whether or not the Linghu Heavenly Clan would take care of them. He was already certain that it would definitely happen.<br>As such, after entering the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, Chu Feng&rsquo;s focus was brought onto himself.<br>The reason for that was because he had discovered that there was a slight change to his body. A special sort of power had appeared in his body. Furthermore, that power was already transforming.<br>That power was related to the Holy Spirit Beast.<br>After Chu Feng defeated the Holy Spirit Beast, the Holy Spirit Beast&rsquo;s body had shattered into pieces and turned into countless bodies of light that pounced toward Chu Feng.<br>Those bodies of light were extremely strange. Chu Feng had used various abilities, but was still unable to stop them.<br>In the end, Chu Feng could only look on helplessly as the bodies of light approached the crimson dragon. Upon coming into contact with the crimson dragon, the bodies of light actually managed to forcibly shatter it. After that, they entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>Fortunately, although the bodies of light were very strange, they did not have any destructive power. They seemed to only possess destructiveness toward the crimson dragon, and did not cause any harm to Chu Feng.<br>Back then, Chu Feng had inspected himself carefully. However, he did not discover anything in particular. Because of that, he no longer concerned himself with it.<br>Never did Chu Feng expect that his body would actually change after he entered the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>This change was completely invisible when looking at him from outside. However, Chu Feng was able to tell that a power was gathering within his body. It was the Holy Spirit Beast&rsquo;s power.<br>Although that power was related to the Holy Spirit Beast, it was not that Holy Spirit Beast&rsquo;s powerful destructiveness.<br>That power does not have a destructive nature. It was merely a guiding power. Chu Feng felt that this power would provide guidance after it finished gathering. Likely, this guidance would be something good.<br>Likely, that guiding power would allow Chu Feng to gain decisive opportunities and become capable of traveling through the Holy Spirit Formation of Light with ease.<br>&ldquo;Is this the reward for defeating the Holy Spirit Beast?&rdquo;<br>Sensing the transformation of the power within his body, a smile emerged on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>That said, the crowd that surrounded Chu Feng were all completely confused upon seeing the smile on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>They had already called out to Chu Feng once. However, not only did Chu Feng not respond to them, he instead suddenly smiled.<br>Could it be&hellip; that Chu Feng has gone stupid?<br>Seeing the strange smile on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face, a woman asked with a concerned look, &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, are&hellip; are you alright?&rdquo;<br>At the same time, Chu Qing and Chu Shuangshuang also walked over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side and asked him worriedly, &ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;<br>Amongst the crowd, Chu Qing and Chu Shuangshuang were definitely the two people that were the most concerned for Chu Feng&rsquo;s well-being.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, please be quiet for now.&rdquo;<br>While the crowd was asking Chu Feng if he was alright, Chu Feng suddenly raised his hand and indicated to the crowd to quiet down.<br>Seeing that, the crowd immediately closed their mouths. Although the crowd was no longer speaking, they were still confused as to why Chu Feng was acting like that.<br>Only Chu Feng himself was certain that he must devote his full concentration to the change that was happening inside his body.<br>The reason for that was because that guiding power had reached a critical junction. At that moment, Chu Feng needed to examine it with his full concentration, and not miss out on the slightest detail. Even the sound from his surroundings was capable of affecting Chu Feng&rsquo;s concentration.<br>This was the reason why Chu Feng told the crowd to quiet down.<br>After a short while, that power finally finished forming, and Chu Feng finally heaved a sigh of relief.<br>Chu Feng had obtained guidance. This guidance would be able to provide extremely significant assistance in the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, what were you all discussing earlier?&rdquo; Finally, Chu Feng raised his head and looked to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, the situation is bad. We&rsquo;ve analyzed the situation a bit, and have determined that the Linghu Heavenly Clan will definitely not let us get away,&rdquo; seeing that Chu Feng had finally returned to normal, the crowd began to voice their concern to him.<br>&ldquo;Is there even a need to analyze something like that? With the way the Linghu Heavenly Clan does things, they will definitely not spare us. Did no one think about that before deciding to come here?&rdquo;<br>Faced with the worried crowd, Chu Feng did not reveal any sign of concern. Instead, he was a bit fed up with their worries.<br>Chu Feng had thought that the newcomers that were able to enter the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm to train should all be elites among the younger generations of their respective clans.<br>For people like them, they should not only possess extraordinary talent for martial cultivation, but their perception and their various other abilities should also surpass their peers.<br>Chu Feng felt that they should all understand the principle of &lsquo;there is no such thing as a free meal in this world.&rsquo;<br>However, seeing the reaction of the crowd, Chu Feng realized that they did not understand that principle at all.<br>They actually thought that they would really be able to enjoy the cultivation resources without worries after entering the Holy Spirit Formation of Light; they actually felt that the Linghu Heavenly Clan would let bygones be bygones.<br>They were simply indulging in fantasy. No, they were not only indulging in fantasy, they were simply thinking about profit and nothing else.<br>Truth be told, Chu Feng began to feel slight disdain toward the crowd.<br>After all, they were only able to enter this place thanks to him. Those people did not do anything at all.<br>They had merely profited without putting forth any effort.<br></p></div>
