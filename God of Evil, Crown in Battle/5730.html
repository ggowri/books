        <h1>Chapter 5730: Chu Feng’s Intention</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t spend too long traveling in the teleportation formation as his destination was still within the same realm. He first went out alone to where Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> was residing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng?&rdquo; Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> quickly rushed forward to welcome him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had sensed the earlier destructive aura too, and he instinctively thought that it must have something to do with Chu Feng. He was terribly worried that Chu Feng might have met with a mishap, which was why he was so excited to see him alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;My apologies, I kept you waiting. On the bright side, everything went well,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he dragged Taishi </span><span>Xingzhong&rsquo;s</span><span> son out of the Cosmos Sack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you really&hellip;&rdquo; Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> was shocked to see Taishi </span><span>Xingzhong&rsquo;s</span><span> son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The latter should have been entitled to the tightest protection, but Chu Feng somehow managed to capture Taishi </span><span>Xingzhong&rsquo;s</span><span> son. With this, it was possible for him to regain his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;B-Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span>&hellip; it really is you! You unfilial thing! How dare you treat me in such a manner when my father raised and provided for you?&rdquo; Taishi </span><span>Xingzhong</span><span> roared in anger upon seeing Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must have been too accustomed to oppressing Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> that this was his first reaction upon seeing the latter despite the plight he was in. He didn&rsquo;t even think that Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> was a human at all; the latter was just medicine to sustain his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uwa</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng kicked Taishi </span><span>Xingzhong&rsquo;s</span><span> son in the face, disfiguring the latter so much that he couldn&rsquo;t speak anymore. &ldquo;Your father will die soon. You&rsquo;re just departing a </span><span>step earlier than him.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng pointed his finger at Taishi </span><span>Xingzhong&rsquo;s</span><span> son, and a formation appeared around him. He changed his hand seal, and a gigantic formation manifested. He then clenched his fist, and the formation contracted into a formation dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He passed the formation dagger to Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> as he said, &ldquo;Go, dig out your bloodline from him with your own hands.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> received the dagger, walked up to Taishi </span><span>Xingzhong&rsquo;s</span><span> son, and plunged it into the latter&rsquo;s body. There was no fear in his eyes, only hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taishi </span><span>Xingzhong&rsquo;s</span><span> son was so shocked by Bai </span><span>Yunqing&rsquo;s</span><span> ferocious expression that he even forgot about his own pain. He had never seen such a side to Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> before. This was not the weak and cowardly man whom he could beat up as he pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn&rsquo;t have time to dwell on it as Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> was digging out his bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Brother Bai, let&rsquo;s get straight to it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he constructed a fusion formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> did his best to cooperate with Chu Feng. It didn&rsquo;t take long for him to regain his bloodline power. His condition improved significantly; he no longer looked like he was on the verge of death. However, his cultivation didn&rsquo;t return to his previous peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be a long journey to regaining his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> was satisfied with the outcome. He would have been a goner if not for Chu Feng, after all. &ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything if you think of me as a brother,&rdquo; Chu Feng interjected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> grinned at Chu Feng. This was his first earnest smile in a long while. He thought that this was the end of him, but who could have thought that Chu Feng would drag him out of the abyss, showing him the light of the day?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng brought Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> to where the Totem Dragon Clan was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief learned about Bai </span><span>Yunqing&rsquo;s</span><span> plight, he proposed bringing Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> together with them to their sanctuary, where they would recuperate from their injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sanctuary was a place for Totem Dragon Clansmen to seek refuge in times of danger. Its location was only passed down through the lineage of Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chiefs, such that not even the grand elders knew about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Long Lin couldn&rsquo;t possibly know about that place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, what are your plans?&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to invite Chu Feng to come with him, but he thought that Chu Feng might have his own plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be heading to the Bloodline Galaxy&rsquo;s Pulse Ignition Ordinary Realm,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you planning to participate in the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Mmhm</span><span>,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take a while for you to travel there. You won&rsquo;t be able to make it in time,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I have my plans. I should be able to make it in time,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Long Chengyu&rsquo;s eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would have doubted it if it was anyone else saying such words, but it was Chu </span><span>Feng.The</span><span> prowess of his protection formation had left such a strong impression on them that they didn&rsquo;t dare to underestimate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Bring me along, Chu Feng,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I wish to go too,&rdquo; Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng looked at the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to seek his approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll accompany you,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said, only to suffer a coughing fit right after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Father, you should head to the sanctuary to recuperate. We can handle it on our own,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other elders concurred too, saying that they could protect Long Chengyu in his place. However, Long Chengyu and Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> expressed that they didn&rsquo;t need anyone&rsquo;s protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Practically all of the elders had suffered some degree of damage, and the stronger they were, the more severe their injuries. The juniors were the only ones who had escaped unscathed from the revolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll only cause trouble to young friend Chu Feng without any protection,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;So be it. Brother Chu Feng isn&rsquo;t afraid of trouble, right?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How can I not be afraid of trouble?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s reply caused Long Chengyu&rsquo;s face to stiffen up, but he quickly added, &ldquo;But the two of you aren&rsquo;t trouble to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Indeed! I am Long Chengyu, after all,&rdquo; Long Chengyu remarked with a hearty smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief shook his head with a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be counting on you then, young friend Chu Feng.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Chengyu shook his fist in excitement. Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> looked delighted too. They knew that their father had acceded to their request.</span></p></div>
