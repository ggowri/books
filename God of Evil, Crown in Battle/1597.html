        <h1>Chapter 1597</h1>
        <div> - Betting With One&rsquo;s Reputation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, who did you think you are for you to dare to actually insult me, Beitang Zimo, in such a manner. I see you&rsquo;re courting death.&rdquo;<br>After hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s mockery and ridicule, Beitang Zimo was immediately enraged. As he spoke, he released his own aura. He was planning to attack Chu Feng. Immediately after that, everyone else from the Beitang Imperial Clan released their auras and planned to attack Chu Feng too.<br>&ldquo;I shall see who dares to do anything to Brother Chu Feng,&rdquo; Seeing that, Nangong Ya snorted coldly, revealed his rank three Half Martial Emperor&rsquo;s aura and stood between Chu Feng and Beitang Zimo. Following him, Nangong Baihe, Nangong Moli and the rest of the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan all entered a state of being prepared for battle.<br>A battle between two grand Imperial Clans could happen at any moment now.<br>Right at this moment, Baili Xinghe who was standing on the lakeside suddenly spoke. &ldquo;Everyone, give me, Baili Xinghe, some face, and do not fight here, okay?&rdquo;<br>After Baili Xinghe spoke, neither Nangong Ya nor Beitang Zimo dared to not give him face. Therefore both of them retrieved their released auras.<br>&ldquo;Trash is trash. All you can do is act like a turtle and hide behind the Nangong Imperial Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, there&rsquo;s another reason why you do not dare to use the method to test your talent. As for that reason, it is also the most realistic reason.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is, you know that you&rsquo;re too weak, and that you will not be able to trigger a single ring of light after using the hand seals. You are afraid of humiliation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You only managed to choose the right path and pass through the Weaponry Refinement Immortal&rsquo;s trials not because you have skills. Rather, it is all because of your luck.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You did nothing more than pick your path blindly. You only managed to choose the right passage by luck. Other than being lucky, you have absolutely no skill at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A mere rank eight Martial King, what could you possibly use to compare yourself to us? What makes you think you can step all over us?&rdquo;<br>Beitang Zimo was unwilling to let this matter slide. It could be seen that his resentment toward Chu Feng was enormous. As for the reason why, it was none other than because Chu Feng was standing in the limelight, and had become the most important character in this Weaponry Bestowment Assembly.<br>However, Beitang Zimo did not discover that Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was already no longer that of a rank eight Martial King, and had instead become a rank nine Martial King. Chu Feng had already reached a breakthrough in his cultivation. However, he was concealing it. With Chu Feng&rsquo;s ability to conceal his cultivation, someone like Beitang Zimo would naturally not be able to discover his true cultivation.<br>&ldquo;Beitang Zimo, you are being too excessive, no? What Chu Feng passed is the Weaponry Refinement Immortal&rsquo;s trials. It is the Weaponry Refinement Immortal who has chosen him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You continously call Chu Feng&rsquo;s ability into question, could you possibly be trying to question the Weaponry Refinement Immortal&rsquo;s acknowledgement of him?&rdquo; Nangong Baihe was unable to continue watching anymore and lashed out at Beitang Zimo.<br>&ldquo;I am naturally not questioning the Weaponry Refinement Immortal. However, I am questioning this Chu Feng. I feel that he is nothing more than trash, that he only managed to pass the trials because of luck.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Else, why would he not even have the courage to test his own talent?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I dare to guarantee that this Chu Feng&rsquo;s true talent will not be able to even trigger a single ring of light,&rdquo; Beitang Zimo spoke with an expression of certainty.<br>&ldquo;Beitang Zimo, I&rsquo;d advise you to leave yourself a life-line. If Brother Chu Feng is truly able to accomplish it, then you&rsquo;ll have slapped yourself in the face,&rdquo; Nangong Ya was unable to watch anymore too.<br>&ldquo;Slap my face? Hahaha&hellip; He must have the ability to do so first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about this&hellip;? A battle with words has no meaning. We will know the result if we have Chu Feng test his talent with the hand seals.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If this Chu Feng is really capable of creating a single ring of light, it would mean that what I, Beitang Zimo, said is incorrect. I, Beitang Zimo, am not someone who will speak ill of others for no reason. Thus, I will publicly present Chu Feng with some treasures to compensate him for my mistake.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone, do you all find this proposal of mine suitable?&rdquo; Beitang Zimo spoke with a loud voice.<br>&ldquo;Yeah! If you have the courage, then give it a try. If you refuse to try, then you&rsquo;re lacking in confidence!&rdquo; The people from the Beitang Imperial Clan shouted loudly.<br>When the people from the Beitang Imperial Clan began to attack Chu Feng nonstop, many of the surrounding bystanders also joined their camp and began to urge Chu Feng to take the test of his talent.<br>That was because after hearing what Beitang Zimo said, they too felt what he said to be reasonable. They all began to doubt whether Chu Feng had passed the trials with his ability or with luck.<br>If Chu Feng had only passed because of luck, they would not be able to accept it at all.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, since they&rsquo;ve all said it like that, you should use the hand seal to prove yourself and let them know exactly how powerful your talent for martial cultivation is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should shut them up with your strength,&rdquo; Nangong Ya urged. While Nangong Ya was not an aggressive individual, he was truly unable to continue watching Beitang Zimo provoke Chu Feng like this.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Chu Feng, if you do not teach someone like him a lesson, he will never respect you, will only have a low opinion of you, and will insult you nonstop,&rdquo; Nangong Baihe also urged.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; At this moment, Chu Feng laughed lightly. Then, he said, &ldquo;I am not interested in your compensation. Let&rsquo;s change it to something different.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say that I, Chu Feng, would not be able to trigger a single ring of light? In that case, let&rsquo;s do it like this. I will not want any of your compensation. However, if I, Chu Feng, am able to trigger a single ring of light, then you shall slap yourself before the crowd once.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I am able to trigger two rings of light, then you shall slap yourself twice. If I am able to trigger five rings of light, then you shall slap yourself five times. Essentially, you shall slap yourself as many times as the number of rings of light I can trigger. Do you dare to accept?&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke with a loud voice.<br>&ldquo;What, you&hellip;&rdquo; After hearing those words, that Beitang Zimo&rsquo;s complexion instantly turned green.<br>If he were to compensate Chu Feng, it would be easy for him to do. After all, his Beitang Imperial Clan was not lacking in wealth. However, if he were to slap himself before the crowd, it would be an extremely shameful thing to do.<br>If Chu Feng failed to trigger any rings of light, then he would be fine, as it would only verify all that he had said before. However, what if Chu Feng managed to trigger a ring of light? Before all these people, there would be no way for Beitang Zimo to act shamelessly and refuse to slap himself. Thus, he would have no choice but to publicly slap himself. If that were to happen, how could Beitang Zimo possibly have the face to face anyone again in the future? His reputation would be instantly ruined.<br>Hesitation. At this moment, Beitang Zimo started to hesitate.<br>He was not only hesitating, he was also regretting. He regretted that he had decided to force Chu Feng to test his talent without any reason at all. And now, not only did he not manage to make things difficult for Chu Feng, he had instead been forced into such a state by him as well.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Are you afraid? You don&rsquo;t dare to accept? What happened to your earlier aggressive attitude and non-stop provocations? Didn&rsquo;t you firmly believe that I was trash that could not even trigger a single ring of light?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all this time, it turns out that the true trash is you, Beitang Zimo. You are such trash that while you dare to provoke another, you don&rsquo;t even have the courage to accept a request from the person who you provoked.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Beitang Zimo, you are truly trash. Real trash,&rdquo; Seeing that Beitang Zimo was hesitating, Chu Feng ruthlessly pointed at him and started to rain curses on him. He was utterly humiliating Beitang Zimo.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have thought that Chu Feng would be this eloquent. Once he started speaking, he immediately made Beitang Zimo scared to even utter a single word. Haha. Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re amazing,&rdquo; Nangong Baihe was very overjoyed by this. That was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s cursing of Beitang Zimo was extremely satisfying to her.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t you think that you can scare me. I, Beitang Zimo, accept your demand. I will slap myself as many times as the number of rings of light that you can trigger. However, if you cannot trigger even a single ring of light, then you must publicly kneel, kowtow to me, slap yourself a hundred times and then say before everyone that you, Chu Feng, are a huge piece of trash who only managed to pass the trials because of luck.&rdquo;<br>Beitang Zimo snarled in anger. Being forced by Chu Feng, he was extremely enraged, and lost all of his ability to reason. He was determined to humiliate Chu Feng, and was even willing to put up his own reputation as the gambling stake to do so.<br></p></div>
