        <div> - Mutual Destruction<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Hearing what Chu Feng said, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster snorted coldly. Then, he looked to Chu Feng, seemingly as if he wanted to continue to insult him.<br>&ldquo;That is?&rdquo;<br>However, at that moment, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster revealed an enormous change in expression.<br>The reason for that was because he was shocked to discover that an item had appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s previously-empty hands.<br>It was a piece of four-sided scrap metal.<br>However, it was precisely that scrap metal that made him feel enormous threat.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that thing Chu Feng holding the Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler from Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s remnant?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang&rsquo;s eyes started to shine. They had all seen the Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler before.<br>However, the Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler from back then could not even be considered to be an Ancestral Armament. Yet now&hellip; it was emitting an aura far superior to an Ancestral Armament.<br>Only the Dragonscale Dagger that the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster held in his hand was comparable to Chu Feng&rsquo;s Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler.<br>&ldquo;Incomplete Immortal Armament. Brother Chu Feng actually managed to obtain an Incomplete Immortal Armament?&rdquo; At that moment, Ying Mingchao and the others were all overjoyed.<br>They finally realized why Chu Feng was this confident. It turned out that not only did he grasp the powerful secret skill, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, but he also possessed an Incomplete Immortal Armament.<br>At that moment when the people from the allied army were overjoyed, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster revealed a worried frown.<br>Actually, there were two more people secretly watching everything.<br>They were the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Chu Huai and Chu Yue.<br>Chu Huai was holding an umbrella.<br>That umbrella was very large. Most importantly, that umbrella was sparkling with a faint light the entire time. As the light sprinkled down on them, it turned the two of them transparent like the umbrella.<br>It was a treasure, a treasure that could conceal the two of them.<br>At the very least, no one could detect the two of them as they watched Chu Feng and the others from afar.<br>Seeing the Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand, Chu Huai said, &ldquo;No wonder that Chu Feng was able to reach a breakthrough to the True Immortal realm this quickly. Seems like he ran into some sort of chance encounter.&rdquo;<br>He felt that Chu Feng&rsquo;s Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler should be something that he obtained from a certain remnant, and that Chu Feng&rsquo;s breakthrough in cultivation must be related to that remnant too.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t his Incomplete Immortal Armament a bit too ugly? Why does it resemble a counterfeit?&rdquo; Chu Yue said with a look of disgust.<br>&ldquo;That is indeed an Incomplete Immortal Armament. Merely, its appearance is simply too lacking,&rdquo; Chu Huai shook his head. He also did not understand why an Incomplete Immortal Armament would have such an appearance.<br>&ldquo;Regardless, with Chu Feng having that Incomplete Immortal Armament, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster will be in imminent peril.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get a bit closer,&rdquo; As Chu Huai spoke, he pulled Chu Yue and began to move toward Chu Feng and the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Hey! Don&rsquo;t get closer. I think senior is most definitely in the vicinity and observing everything. If he is to discover that the two of us haven&rsquo;t left yet, he will definitely scold us,&rdquo; Chu Yue said.<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say that with this umbrella here, unless one is a Heavenly Immortal-level expert or above, no one will be able to see the two of us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though senior is powerful, he is only a peak True Immortal. It is impossible for him to detect the two of us,&rdquo; Chu Huai said.<br>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Chu Yue asked.<br>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; Chu Huai nodded with certainty.<br>&ldquo;Okay then,&rdquo; Chu Yue was unable to change Chu Huai&rsquo;s mind, and thus decided to agree with his decision.<br>However, an excited expression soon appeared in her eyes. It could be seen that she actually also wanted to approach the battle.<br>&ldquo;Die!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng unleashed his attack. That said, he did not directly rush to attack the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster. Instead, he controlled the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and moved it toward the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster to attack him.<br>Since Chu Feng had declared that he would kill the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster with his Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, he planned to use the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword to kill him.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! Where did this little bastard obtain an Incomplete Immortal Armament?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster turned around and started to flee. He actually did not dare to face Chu Feng.<br>This action by the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was understandable. After Chu Feng revealed his Incomplete Immortal Armament, the chipped Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword was immediately restored to how it was, and even grew much larger. Furthermore, the aura that it currently emitted brought fear to the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster&rsquo;s heart.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>While escaping from Chu Feng, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster suddenly felt that some things had appeared in his palm again.<br>Looking down toward his palm, he discovered that they were forbidden medicines. It was the same golden forbidden medicine. The amount this time around was even greater than last time.<br>&ldquo;Break them apart and their effect will be activated,&rdquo; Right at that moment, that Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s old man&rsquo;s voice sounded again.<br>Hearing those words, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster grew nervous. The forbidden medicines he had taken earlier had already overburdened his body. He was already playing with his life. When the backlash from those forbidden medicines arrived, he might only have a slight chance of survival.<br>And if he were to take those forbidden medicines too, it was likely not even the heavens would be able to save him.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, those forbidden medicines will not take your life. They are extremely precious forbidden medicines. Their backlash is not as strong as you imagine them to be.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Break them apart, and I guarantee that you will live.&rdquo;<br>Knowing that the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was worried, that old man started to urge him.<br>However, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster still didn&rsquo;t believe that old man. He continued to hesitate on using the forbidden medicines.<br>&ldquo;Use them immediately. Else, you will die by Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword. Are you really willing to be defeated by a brat like him?&rdquo; The old man said.<br>Hearing those words, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster suddenly realized that the enormous aura was growing closer to him. He turned around and discovered that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword was already on him and approaching. He was unable to escape.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, even if it ends in mutual destruction, I will still make you die first.&rdquo;<br>As the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster spoke, he smashed apart all of the forbidden medicines in his palm.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, surging golden gaseous flames erupted from his body. The gaseous flames were so powerful that they managed to knock the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword away.<br>Like a loose leaf, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword that was over three hundred meters long started to roll in the sky as it was knocked several miles away in an instant.<br>&ldquo;That is?&rdquo; Witnessing that scene, the expressions of Ying Mingchao and the others all changed.<br>The reason for that was because none of them noticed that golden forbidden medicines appeared in the hand of the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster. Thus, none of them knew what had happened.<br>At that moment, they could only tell that the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was enveloped by enormously powerful golden gaseous flames. His silhouette simply could not even be seen clearly within the golden gaseous flames.<br>That said, an extremely powerful aura was being emitted from within the golden gaseous flames.<br>That sort of sensation caused the crowd to feel unease.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Huai, exactly what did he use?&rdquo; Even Chu Yue from the Upper Realm was unable to contain her curiosity.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a forbidden medicine. An extremely precious forbidden medicine. The Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm shouldn&rsquo;t possess this sort of forbidden medicine. It must be from the Upper Realms. How did this Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster obtain those forbidden medicines?&rdquo; Chu Huai started to ponder.<br>&ldquo;This is bad. The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster&rsquo;s aura is rapidly rising. Heavens&hellip; it&rsquo;s already infinitely close to that of a rank three True Immortal.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those forbidden medicines are simply too powerful. With his strength, even though he has not truly reached rank three True Immortal, it is likely no one with a cultivation of rank two True Immortal or below will be a match for him,&rdquo; Chu Yue said nervously.<br>As someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan, she also deeply detested the Infant Soul Sect. Thus, neither she nor Chu Huai wanted the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster to defeat Chu Feng.<br>On the contrary, they both wanted Chu Feng to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, another loud explosion sounded. The golden gaseous flames that had surrounded the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster started to rapidly scatter about in all directions. At that moment, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster reappeared before the crowd.<br>&ldquo;This guy?!&rdquo;<br>Seeing the current Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster, Ying Mingchao and the others started to panic even more.<br>The current Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was no longer a skeleton. He had regained his former appearance.<br>Merely, it was not an actual corporeal body. Rather, he was in a spirit body form.<br>Merely, his spirit body form was different from ordinary spirit bodies.<br>Ordinary spirit bodies were generally either transparent, light blue or dark blue.<br>However, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster&rsquo;s spirit body was golden in color.<br>Furthermore, he was currently emitting an extremely powerful aura.<br>It was so powerful&hellip;.<br>...that Ying Mingchao and the others felt despair.<br><br></p></div>
