        <div> - Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Ox-nosed Old Daoist and Grandmaster Tang Chen were old friends.<br>While Grandmaster Tang Chen knew about the Ox-nosed Old Daoist very well, there were still some things that he doesn&rsquo;t know.<br>Usually, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was someone fond of joking around and not decent and proper.<br>But, when it comes to something major like this, he would never joke around.<br>As such, Grandmaster Tang Chen firmly believed in the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s claim of the Demon Morph Clan having already left and heaved a sigh of relief.<br>Then, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist helped Grandmaster Tang CHen handle some other things.<br>After handling those things, he left with Chu Feng and Yu Ting.<br>After leaving the Seven Suns Mountain Range, Chu Feng requested the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to help him with one thing.<br>They proceeded for the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Chu Feng was worried about Zhao Hong&rsquo;s capture the entire time.<br>Zhao Hong was captured as a threat to him. He was not allowed to disguise himself or use any alias.<br>The more Chu Feng thought about it, the more baffled he became.<br>Exactly who would make such a strange request?<br>In fact, Chu Feng was unable to determine if the person that made the request was a friend or a foe.<br>Thus, he wanted to have the Ox-nosed Old Daoist help him and see if he could determine any clues from the location where Zhao Hong was captured.<br>He wanted to see if the Ox-nosed Old Daoist could determine who it was that captured Zhao Hong.<br>En route, Chu Feng inquired about the Ox-nosed Old Daoist things he was curious about.<br>For example, the Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock.<br>That Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock was a treasure the Ox-nosed Old Daoist left in a remnant.<br>Back then, Long Xiaoxiao requested for Chu Feng&rsquo;s assistance in breaching that spirit formation. Her purpose was a single item -- the Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock.<br>Unfortunately, they did not find it after entering the remnant and nearly lost their lives to the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for Chu Feng&rsquo;s prompt arrival, Long Xianxiao, Long Shenbu and others would&rsquo;ve really perished in that remnant under the All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s hands.<br>Chu Feng felt that the Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock was not retrieved by someone ahead of Long Xiaoxiao. Rather, it was taken away by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist himself.<br>&ldquo;Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s indeed with this old man. Why are you asking that?&rdquo; asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist as he looked to Chu Feng.<br>Sure enough, Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess was correct. The Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock has indeed been retrieved by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Chu Feng did not bother to conceal anything and informed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist about Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Take it.&rdquo;<br>Learning what happened, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist immediately took out an item and handed it to Chu Feng.<br>It was a lock. The lock was bronze in color and appeared very exquisite.<br>There were powers within the lock. But, Chu Feng cannot make out what sort of power was within the lock.<br>The lock was not very large. It was only the size of a closed fist. There were three dragons coiling atop the lock.<br>Those dragons were clearly not real yet they appeared so lifelike. It seemed as if they would become alive the next instant.<br>One could tell from a single glance that the Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock was an extraordinary item.<br>&ldquo;This Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock is something that only those with the Dragon&rsquo;s Bloodline could open.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The people from the Dragon Clan are most likely able to open it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The power within the lock will be able to provide a certain assistance to those with the Dragon&rsquo;s Bloodline. That is why the little princess of the Dragon Clan that you knew wanted to obtain it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To us, this thing is capable of being sold for a decent change. But, apart from that, it&rsquo;s completely useless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since that Dragon Clan&rsquo;s little princess had helped you, go ahead and use this to return her the favor,&rdquo; The Ox-nosed Old Daoist said to Chu Feng.<br>To the people from the Dragon Clan, the value of the Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock was definitely extremely high.<br>Yet, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist handed it to Chu Feng so effortlessly. From this, one could tell how much he was willing to splurge on Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Thank you master,&rdquo; Chu Feng bowed joyously.<br>At the beginning, Chu Feng merely asked out of curiosity. He did not have any intention of obtaining the Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock.<br>But, since the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was giving it to him, he wanted to give it to someone that could make use out of it.<br>Ignoring Long Xiaoxiao, Long Daozhi was also someone from the Dragon Clan.<br>This Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock would also be enormously useful to Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Master, this disciple has one more thing that I wish to seek master&rsquo;s help with,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he took out the Qilin&rsquo;s egg.<br>&ldquo;Where did you obtain that?&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s gaze started to blaze with emotions upon seeing the egg.<br>Chu Feng did not conceal anything. Not only did he inform the Ox-nosed Old Daoist the details about how he obtained the Qilin&rsquo;s egg, he also informed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist what happened with this Qilin&rsquo;s egg.<br>Of course, he also informed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist his worries.<br>Chu Feng was afraid that this Qilin&rsquo;s egg would really give birth to a mythical Qilin that he might not be able to tame.<br>&ldquo;According to you, it seems that the egg is about to hatch. Indeed, it&rsquo;s quite problematic.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let this old man think about it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Got it! I know a place that might be able to suppress the power of this thing and help you control it,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground,&rdquo; replied the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground?&rdquo; Chu Feng was surprised upon hearing those words.<br>Merely from hearing its name, Chu Feng the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground had something to do with the Dragon Clan.<br>&ldquo;The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground is a special place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The power of that place is quite different. This old man had experienced the power there before. According to the Dragon Clan, that power of the True Dragon&rsquo;s Aura.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is said that in order to subdue a powerful creature like a Qilin, one would need to utilize the power of another powerful creature.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The True Dragon&rsquo;s Aura should be able to help you subdue it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you want to subdue it, you&rsquo;ll have to set up a spirit formation to do so. But, if you are to set up your spirit formation inside the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground utilizing the True Dragon&rsquo;s Aura, the results should be even better.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I cannot be certain what the outcome will be, it is something worthy of trying.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to coincidentally hand the Triple Dragon Coiling Soul Lock to the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s little princess?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect timing. We&rsquo;ll proceed over there.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, while you can return your favor openly, you&rsquo;ll have to sneak your way into the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Dragon Clan pays utmost importance toward a place like that. They would definitely not allow outsiders like us to enter it,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Sure. We&rsquo;ll do as master says,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied joyously.<br>While the Ox-nosed Old Daoist looked very unreliable, Chu Feng knew that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was actually very reliable.<br>Then, Chu Feng, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and Yu Ting arrived at the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>But, even with the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s help, they were still unable to find any clue leading to whom it might be that captured Zhao Hong.<br>Feeling helpless, Chu feng had no choice but to do as that mysterious kidnapper ordered.<br>He would have to face the world using his real identity.<br>After the journey to the Red-dress Holy Land bore no fruit, the three of them changed route to proceed for the Dragon Clan.<br>The Dragon Clan was one of the few starfields&rsquo; overlords on this Holy Light Galaxy. As such, they were very powerful.<br>It was so much that they possessed multiple Martial Exalted level experts.<br>Entering the Dragon Clan was no easy task.<br>Thus, in order to prevent the unexpected, Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist did not bring Yu Ting along.<br>They had her wait for them outside the Dragon Clan.<br>Then, the master and disciple entered the Dragon Clan.<br>The Dragon Clan was enormous and tightly guarded.<br>Attempting to sneak one&rsquo;s way into the Dragon Clan would be akin to ascending the heavens.<br>But, who was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist?<br>He was one of the strongest world spiritists in the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>Furthermore, he possessed numerous abilities. After all, he was someone capable of fusing Divine Powers to someone with a bloodline.<br>Thus, under the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s leader, Chu Feng not only effortlessly entered the Dragon Clan, they also managed to enter an unmanned region in this place filled with experts. There was simply no one to stop their path or even discover them.<br>Just like that, Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist effortlessly arrived at the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s forbidden area.<br>They saw that so-called Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground!<br></p></div>
