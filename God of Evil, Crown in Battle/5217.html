        <div>: An Existence That Can Destroy Starfields<br>Eggy didn&rsquo;t say a word, but her eyes turned cold.<br>&ldquo;What happened to those two nobodies? Why are they unconscious? Did they suffer a backlash because the final treasure here refuses to acknowledge them?&rdquo;<br>Daoist Eighth Dragon scanned the hall to look for the final treasure.<br>&ldquo;Get lost,&rdquo; Milady Queen said in an incredibly hostile tone.<br>&ldquo;A young lass dares to speak so arrogantly. Do you know who we are?&rdquo; Daoist Ninth Dragon bellowed furiously.<br>He had been harboring a grudge toward Chu Feng and Tao Wu for some time now.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a damn who you are. Scram if you don&rsquo;t want to die!&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;You wench! It looks like you&rsquo;re in need of a lesson!&rdquo;<br>Daoist Ninth Dragon channeled his spirit power as an Exalted Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist into countless arrows and shot them at Eggy. He was planning to take Eggy&rsquo;s life with this move.<br>Had Eggy&rsquo;s cultivation been beneath rank eight Half-God level, she would have definitely died a gruesome death.<br>What was noteworthy was that Daoist Ninth Dragon&rsquo;s attack was only targeted at Eggy. He didn't attempt to take Chu Feng or Tao Wu&rsquo;s life. This was because he noticed the lack of the final treasure in the hall, which made him wonder if it was on them.<br>Naturally, he couldn&rsquo;t kill them until they threw up the final treasure.<br>Shoosh!<br>Eggy whizzed right up to the spirit power arrows and dissipated them with a wave of her hand. At the same time, she released a brilliant burst of golden light toward Daoist Ninth Dragon.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! This wench is also&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Daoist Ninth Dragon understood why Eggy was so arrogant despite only being at Martial Exalted level. It turned out that she had also gained the strength of a peak Half-God level cultivator.<br>It was fortunate that he didn&rsquo;t come alone, or else he might have died there and then. Beside him, Daoist Eighth Dragon raised his hand to block off Eggy&rsquo;s attack.<br>Seeing that her attack had been blocked, Eggy set her golden aura ablaze and thrust her palm at Daoist Ninth Dragon.<br>In response, Daoist Ninth Dragon hurriedly set up a defensive formation.<br>Boom!<br>However, the defensive formation shattered right away under Eggy&rsquo;s attack. The shockwave from the collision pushed both Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Ninth Dragon backward.<br>The protected Daoist Ninth Dragon was relatively unharmed, but Daoist Eighth Dragon, who suffered the brunt of the blow, spurted a mouthful of blood.<br>&ldquo;That wench!!!!&rdquo;<br>Daoist Eighth Dragon was astounded. Eggy&rsquo;s strength was greater than he had thought.<br>While it was true that he was severely weakened by the backlash of his forbidden medicine, he couldn&rsquo;t confidently say that he would be able to defeat the current Eggy even if he was at his peak condition.<br>Shoosh shoosh!<br>Eggy lashed out at the two daoists with her hands scrunched like eagle talons. The murderous intent in her eyes made it clear that she was out for their lives.<br>Surprisingly, Daoist Eighth Dragon didn&rsquo;t respond at all, not bothering to dodge or counterattack. It was not because he had run out of strength but that he chose not to. At the same time, a sinister smile formed on his lips.<br>It was the same for Daoist Ninth Dragon too.<br>This was an incomprehensible sight to Eggy, but she didn&rsquo;t bother thinking deeper into it. The only thought in her mind was to kill those two eyesores.<br>Weng!<br>Just as Eggy was about to strike those two daoists, a barrier suddenly appeared before her, blocking her attack.<br>Shoosh!<br>Eggy quickly backed away with indignance in her eyes. She realized that the barrier protecting the two daoists was extremely strong, surpassing the limitations of God-cloak.<br>The hall began to tremble intensely as a terrifying wave of spirit power suffused the area.<br>At the same time, the space before Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Ninth Dragon started rippling as a figure stepped out.<br>It was a white-haired elder dressed in a daoist robe who carried a sword behind his back. Despite his graceful demeanor, he emanated tremendous strength that suppressed everything in his presence.<br>Eggy frowned.<br>She could already tell that she stood no chance against the elder.<br>&ldquo;I am Seventh Dragon, Daoist Seventh Dragon,&rdquo; the elder said.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who you are. I just want you to leave this place,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;Leave this place?&rdquo;<br>Daoist Seventh Dragon chuckled softly under his breath.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, I won&rsquo;t stop you if you wish to leave this place. However, those two men offended my brothers. I can&rsquo;t let them leave this place alive,&rdquo; Daoist Seventh Dragon said.<br>&ldquo;Is there no room for negotiation?&rdquo;<br>Knowing that she wasn&rsquo;t a match for Daoist Seventh Dragon, Eggy&rsquo;s voice softened considerably. She wasn&rsquo;t afraid of death, but she was worried for Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, I am an Asura World Spiritist too. I can sever the contract between you and your useless master. Would you be willing to come under me?&rdquo; Daoist Seventh Dragon asked.<br>&ldquo;Who are you calling useless? To me, you&rsquo;re the useless one!&rdquo;<br>However, Daoist Seventh Dragon&rsquo;s insult made her anger surge back up. She thought that there wasn&rsquo;t any use in being polite anymore since the other party had no intention of letting them live. Negotiations had already broken down here.<br>If she had to die here, she would at least die with guts.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, you must be a highly talented world spirit to have been able to come this far. It&rsquo;s truly a pity that you can&rsquo;t read the situation. Since that&rsquo;s the case&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Daoist Seventh Dragon&rsquo;s face warped in viciousness.<br>&ldquo;&hellip; you may die now.&rdquo;<br>The terrifying spirit power suffusing the hall gushed toward Eggy.<br>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;<br>Daoist Seventh Dragon froze up the very next moment. His spirit power should have been more than enough to decimate Eggy, but for some reason, it was unable to reach Eggy at all. His spirit power was being warded off by some kind of mysterious force.<br>But that should have been impossible.<br>He was a True Dragon World Spiritist, a being comparable to a True God level cultivator! Who in the world could have the power to block his spirit power?<br>&ldquo;The world of cultivation is becoming worse with each generation. It&rsquo;s one thing to be weak, but it&rsquo;s another thing to talk big despite that. You say that we ought to die because we have offended your brothers? Who do you think you are?&rdquo; a mocking voice suddenly echoed.<br>Turning their sights over, the three daoists and Eggy widened their eyes in shock.<br>The person who had just spoken was none other than Tao Wu. He had stood back up at some point in time, and his appearance had changed considerably. His eyes were blood-red, and two sharp fangs could be seen extending out from his mouth.<br>Rather than a human or a monstrous beast, he looked more like a demon.<br>Most important of all, he was emanating the aura of the Ancient Era. This meant that he wasn&rsquo;t a present-day cultivator but a being from the Ancient Era.<br>&ldquo;Step back, lass. I&rsquo;ll deal with those flies.&rdquo;<br>Tao Wu stepped forward, shielding Eggy and Chu Feng behind him. He cast a disdainful glance at the hall shrouded in spirit power.<br>&ldquo;A mere True Dragon World Spiritist thinks that he&rsquo;s invincible?&rdquo;<br>A sharp glint flashed across Tao Wu&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Boom!<br>An overpowering aura poured out from Tao Wu&rsquo;s body, instantaneously dissipating Daoist Seventh Dragon&rsquo;s spirit power. Even the seemingly indestructible hall also started cracking under his might.<br>Boom!<br>The hall finally succumbed to the pressure and scattered into dust. The crowd found themselves standing in the midst of a boundless void.<br>The three daoists, including Daoist Seventh Dragon, had gone completely pale by this point. Their lips quivered in fear, and they didn&rsquo;t even dare to breathe loudly.<br>Tao Wu stood still on the spot, his appearance hardly changing at all other than his facial features. However, a colossal avatar of immeasurable proportions had manifested behind him. The avatar was so big that no one could make out its full appearance.<br>It was not that the avatar was incomplete but that none of them was strong enough to see the avatar in its full glory.<br>Nevertheless, they could still sense the terrifying power harnessed by the avatar.<br>The three daoists had faced plenty of opponents over the years, but they had never experienced such immense power before. It left them feeling both helpless and suffocated as if they were ants that could be squashed at any moment.<br>It was a power so great that it could even destroy an entire starfield.<br>&ldquo;W-who in the world are you?&rdquo; Daoist Seventh Dragon asked with a quivering voice.<br>&ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; Tao Wu repeated the question with a cold smile.<br>&ldquo;I am none other than Taowu!!!&rdquo;<br></div>
