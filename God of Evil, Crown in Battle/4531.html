        <div>: Going All Out to Protect Chu Feng<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the expression on the elder&rsquo;s face, Long Daozhi immediately realized that something was amiss, so he quickly gestured for the other party to continue speaking.<br>&ldquo;Lord City Master, i-it&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s the crowd from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect!&rdquo; the elder said.<br>&ldquo;Flying Feather Heavenly Sect? What&rsquo;s wrong with them? Are they thinking that I have dragged the matter out for too long, so they have changed their minds and don&rsquo;t want to wait any longer?&rdquo; Long Daozhi asked with a slightly nervous look on his face.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it. Rather, it seems like young hero Chu Feng has unintentionally offended the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect!&rdquo; the elder replied.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng? What happened? Hurry up and tell me!&rdquo;<br>As soon as Long Daozhi learned that there had been a conflict between Chu Feng and the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, a flustered look appeared on Long Daozhi&rsquo;s face.<br>The elder quickly filled Long Daozhi in on what had happened.<br>The reason why the elder learned about the matter so quickly was because those from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect had already come knocking on Long Daozhi&rsquo;s doors over this matter.<br>&ldquo;Haaa&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Upon learning the ins and outs of the matter, a tight frown formed on Long Daozhi&rsquo;s forehead.<br>The others also had worried looks on their faces. The situation really wasn&rsquo;t looking too good at the moment.<br>It was because they knew about the background of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect that they couldn&rsquo;t help but be so worried about this matter.<br>In their view, the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect was a power that one mustn&rsquo;t offend regardless of the situation, but Chu Feng just had to cross them. This made them feel incredibly frustrated.<br>This was further worsened by the fact that Chu Feng had close ties with the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, such that Long Daozhi couldn&rsquo;t just disregard this matter.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng sure is&hellip; Of all people that he could offend, why did he have to offend the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect?!&rdquo; Long Ning exclaimed in exasperation.<br>Without a doubt, Chu Feng was one of the few people whom Long Ning considered as her friend. If Chu Feng was in trouble, she was more than willing to step in and help.<br>However, what complicated this matter was the sheer importance the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect was to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City at the moment, which led to her harboring some complaints regarding this matter.<br>&ldquo;Long Ning, the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect has always been overbearing. Young friend Chu Feng is not to be blamed for this matter. Since what&rsquo;s happened has already happened, there&rsquo;s no point complaining about it now. We&rsquo;ll just have to deal with it promptly.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, please wait here for a moment, I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Long Daozhi quickly rose into the air and left the area.<br>Wuming Doutian and a few others chose to remain before the stone doors, but Long Ning and the other experts of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City chose to head back with Long Daozhi. After all, this was a matter that concerned the entire Ancestral Martial Dragon City.<br>Soon, they returned back to the main hall of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.<br>Even though the guards of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City were guarding the exteriors of the hall, the interior of the hall had already been occupied by another power&mdash;the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect.<br>Amongst the group from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, the strongest of them all was a lanky old man who had a cunning face. He was the sectmaster of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect.<br>Standing beside the sectmaster of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect was the female disciple whom Chu Feng encountered earlier with the crowd from the Starfall Holy Land.<br>The group from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect all had forbidding looks on their faces, and as soon as Long Daozhi walked in, they immediately vented their rage on him.<br>&ldquo;City Master Long, you have to give us an explanation for this!&rdquo;<br>The crowd from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect bellowed.<br>Despite being mere elders from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, they didn&rsquo;t show the slightest respect toward Long Daozhi at all.<br>&ldquo;Hey, watch your tone! How dare you speak with such insolence to City Master Long? Back down!&rdquo; the sectmaster of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect suddenly spoke up and held his people back.<br>He was sitting quietly inside the hall, sipping on his tea. His leisurely attitude formed a stark contrast to the enraged group from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect.<br>Nevertheless, displeased looks still appeared on the faces of those from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City when they saw him.<br>They were currently in the main hall of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, and the center seat should have been the seat that only Long Daozhi, as the City Master, was worthy of.<br>Yet, the sectmaster of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect was currently taking that seat, which fully displayed his disregard for Long Daozhi.<br>Despite his seemingly courteous attitude, everyone present knew that the most arrogant ones inside the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect were no other than him and his younger brother.<br>However, due to the fact that the Ancestral Martial Dragon City had a request to make of them, as well as the special background of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, Long Daozhi could only forcefully push his rage down.<br>&ldquo;Sectmaster Dian, I have already heard about the incident. However, young friend Chu Feng is an esteemed guest of our Ancestral Martial Dragon City, so may I ask you to drop this matter on my account?&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi immediately got straight to the point after entering the main hall.<br>&ldquo;Ah, so that arrogant brat is City Master Long&rsquo;s guest? That really complicates things for all of us. That brat didn&rsquo;t just hurt my disciple, he even killed my sect members too. As you can see, our elders are all gathered here to settle the score. Do you think that my people will take it lying if I were to drop the matter so easily?&rdquo;<br>The sectmaster of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect eyed Long Daozhi discreetly as he sipped on his tea leisurely.<br>&ldquo;Sectmaster Dian, I am indebted to young friend Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll never hand him over to you,&rdquo; Long Daozhi replied firmly.<br>&ldquo;Long Daozhi, you must not want to return back to the Dragon Clananymore, huh?&rdquo;<br>A furious howl suddenly echoed across the main hall. It was coming from one of the Supreme Elders of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect.<br>Despite the Supreme Elder&rsquo;s old age, he had a massive physique reminiscent of that of a bull. This Supreme Elder was also of exceptional standing too; he was the younger brother of the sectmaster of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, Dian Kuang.<br>Just as his name suggested, Dian Kuang was an extremely arrogant person who did as he pleased.<br>Typically speaking, Long Daozhi just had to use a sliver of his oppressive might in order to crush Dian Kuang down to the ground, but for some reason, Long Daozhi didn&rsquo;t make a move on him at all. Not only so, but he didn&rsquo;t even dare to talk back to Dian Kuang.<br>Instead, he courteously clasped his fist toward Dian Kuang and said, &ldquo;Chu Feng is indeed at fault for this matter. Allow me to apologize to you on his behalf. As long as you can let him off, I&rsquo;ll consider any conditions that you have.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Any conditions that we have?&rdquo; the sectmaster of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect repeated those words.<br>&ldquo;Yes. As long as you drop the matter, I&rsquo;ll consider any conditions you have,&rdquo; Long Daozhi acknowledged those words.<br>&ldquo;I want twofold of what we have agreed on previously,&rdquo; the sectmaster of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect said.<br>&ldquo;What? Twofold?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sectmaster Dian, you&rsquo;re going too far here!&rdquo;<br>The crowd from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City finally came to the limits of his patience.<br>Yet, faced with the wrath from the crowd from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, the sectmaster of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect sneered coldly and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you understand the situation here yet. It&rsquo;s your Ancestral Martial Dragon City who&rsquo;s begging me for a favor over here. One of your guests has offended me, and it&rsquo;s out of the magnanimity of my heart that I&rsquo;m willing to let him off in exchange for twofold of what we have agreed on.<br>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t agree to it, we can leave right away. But before we leave, I&rsquo;ll take that brat Chu Feng&rsquo;s life with me. I&rsquo;d really like to see if any of you here dares to stop me!&rdquo;<br>Right after saying those words, the sectmaster of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect rose to his feet and began walking out of the main hall.<br>From the air he was putting on, it seemed like he was heading off to take Chu Feng&rsquo;s life right away.<br>The remaining members of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect also followed closely behind him as they smugly drew their weapons, as if they were declaring war on the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.<br>&ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll agree to it!&rdquo;<br>It was at this moment that Long Daozhi suddenly spoke up.<br>&ldquo;Lord City Master!!&rdquo;<br>Those words made the faces of those from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City warp in horror. They knew just how much twofold of what they had agreed on previously would amount to, and that wasn&rsquo;t a sum that they afford to fork out just like that.<br>However, Long Daozhi silenced the crowd by directing a glare toward them.<br>&ldquo;City Master Long, can I hold you to your word? In case you didn&rsquo;t hear correctly, I&rsquo;m asking for twofold of what we have previously agreed on,&rdquo; the sectmaster of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect asked Long Daozhi.<br>Even he was astonished to hear Long Daozhi agreeing to his request.<br>&ldquo;I, Long Daozhi, am a man of my words. I&rsquo;ll have to ask Sectmaster Dian and Brother Dian Kuang to take a rest in our Ancestral Martial Dragon City for a while longer. Once I prepare what you need, I&rsquo;ll send it over right away,&rdquo; Long Daozhi said.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha, very well! We&rsquo;ll accept your goodwill then! City Master Long, I&rsquo;ll hold you to the end of your promise. If you break your promise, that&rsquo;ll signify the end of our friendship. By then, we&rsquo;ll become enemies with one another.&rdquo;<br>The sectmaster of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect laughed heartily as he spoke to Long Daozhi with a threatening edge to his words.<br>He was telling Long Daozhi that it was already too late for regrets, but he would have to pay a heavy price if he were to back out from the promise right now.<br>Gleeful smiles also broke out on the faces of those from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect. They had come with livid looks on their faces, but they were now leaving with hearty laughter.<br>Even as their figures were no longer within sight, their gleeful laughter still seemed to echo within the main hall.<br></p></div>
