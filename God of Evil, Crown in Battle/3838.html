        <h1>Chapter 3837</h1>
        <div> - Snake Mark Saint-cloak<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did Chu Feng return to his bedroom?<br>Naturally, he did it so that he could enter closed-door training.<br>Over the past few days, Chu Feng had studied the case very thoroughly.<br>He was only a fine line away from becoming a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>What Chu Feng wanted to do was to achieve a breakthrough.<br>Didn&rsquo;t Zhang Duotuo use his identity as a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist to threaten the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster?<br>If Chu Feng were to also become a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he would be able to help the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>With that, what could that Zhang Duotuo possibly threaten the Red-dress Holy Land with?<br>That absurd marriage would also be canceled.<br>Perhaps because he was extremely impatient, Chu Feng managed to make his breakthrough extremely quickly. After merely two hours, Chu Feng had managed to successfully break through to become a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>As Chu Feng knew that he would be able to make a breakthrough, he did not show any hint of joy from it. Instead, he only had impatience.<br>That said, after Chu Feng pushed open the door to his bedroom, he discovered that Lil Xin was even more anxious than him.<br>That girl was not only restless; pacing back and forth, but she was so anxious that her face was covered in sweat.<br>&ldquo;Young master Asura, what were you doing earlier? You couldn&rsquo;t possibly have gone to sleep at such a time, right?&rdquo; Lil Xin said whilst looking at Chu Feng. There was even a trace of complaint on her face.<br>&ldquo;Where is the appointed gamble going to take place? Can you bring me there?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t have the authority to enter that place," said Lil Xin.<br>&ldquo;In that case, tell me where it is. I will go there myself," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t do either. You can&rsquo;t go there,&rdquo; said Lil Xin.<br>&ldquo;If you tell me where it is, I will be able to prevent Yin Zhuanghong from being married to Meng Rufei,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Lil Xin was skeptical.<br>&ldquo;Of course. Think about it yourself. If you don't tell me where it is at a time like this, your Holy Daughter might really end up being married off to Meng Rufei,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;<br>Lil Xin stopped hesitating and informed Chu Feng of the location.<br>For the sake of preventing unnecessary troubles, Chu Feng concealed himself with the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak. Only then did he proceed towards the location of the gamble.<br>Although there were many checkpoints and elders standing guard, there were no difficult defensive formations guarding the way. Thus, Chu Feng&rsquo;s journey was rather unimpeded.<br>Chu Feng arrived at the destination before the appointed time.<br>The location was an isolated island. The island was somewhat peculiar.<br>There were tall mountains all around the island. In the center of the island was an enormous open space.<br>That place resembled a cage. Yet, the buildings and constructions there were extremely refined.<br>Chu Feng suspected that that place was normally used by the Red-dress Holy Land to hold grand events.<br>At that moment, there were quite a lot of people gathered there too.<br>Apart from Yin Zhuanghong, the others present were all elders of the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>They numbered over a thousand.<br>The great majority of them were peak Exalted. Furthermore, at least thirty of them were rank one Utmost Exalted.<br>Two amongst them were even rank two Utmost Exalteds.<br>Rank two Utmost Exalted was a very powerful level of cultivation.<br>However, the two rank two Utmost Exalteds were not the strongest individuals present. The strongest individual present was a middle-aged woman.<br>That woman was rather good-looking. Even though she had the appearance of a middle-aged woman, her age was unable to conceal her devastatingly beautiful face.<br>That woman gave off an extremely powerful air. Standing there, she resembled the queen of the entire world, ruling over everything. She was so intimidating that no one would dare to blaspheme her.<br>Standing behind that woman was Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Although it was his first time seeing her, Chu Feng knew that this rank three Utmost Exalted-level woman must be the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster, Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s master.<br>Chu Feng had naturally heard about Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s master before.<br>Her name was Han Xiu. She was not only the strongest expert of the Red-dress Holy Land, but she was also the strongest expert of the entire Reincarnation Upper Realm. In fact, she was even a top expert in the entire All-heaven Starfield.<br>The Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster stood at the front, followed by the elders behind her.<br>Although their number was not extremely large, they appeared extremely imposing and powerful.<br>The people there practically represented the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s strongest battle power.<br>From this, Chu Feng was able to tell that the gamble was truly no small matter.<br>It was no wonder that the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster was willing to betroth Yin Zhuanghong to Meng Rufei.<br>Of course, apart from the experts from the Red-dress Holy Land, there were two people that did not belong to the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>They were naturally Meng Rufei and his master, Zhang Duotuo.<br>Although Meng Rufei stood behind Zhang Duotuo, his gaze was fixed onto Yin Zhuanghong the entire time. He was smiling so hard that drool was about to roll down his chin.<br>Being looked upon by Meng Rufei in such a manner, Yin Zhuanghong appeared very uncomfortable.<br>Her discomfort was understandable. Standing far away was a toad. That toad was looking at her as if he wanted to devour her. If anyone else were standing in her shoes, they would also find it very unpleasant.<br>Suddenly, Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s gaze shifted. She first revealed a look of shock, and then a look of joy.<br>Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong were looking at each other. The location where Yin Zhuanghong looked to was Chu Feng&rsquo;s location.<br>&ldquo;That girl&rsquo;s eyes are simply too powerful.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt very helpless. He knew that even though he had managed to conceal himself from everyone, including Zhang Duotuo and the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster with the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, he had failed to conceal himself from Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s eyes.<br>That girl had managed to detect him instantly.<br>Not only had she managed to detect him, but she also managed to see through his world spirit techniques.<br>She knew that Chu Feng had become a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Thus, she also knew that Chu Feng was there to help her.<br>That was why she had a look of joy.<br>&ldquo;Zhanghong, why are you laughing?&rdquo; asked the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>As she spoke, she also looked over towards Chu Feng&rsquo;s direction.<br>In fact, it was not only the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster who looked over toward Chu Feng. Everyone present all looked to Chu Feng&rsquo;s direction.<br>It turned out that Yin Zhuanghong was overjoyed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance, and had actually laughed out loud unknowingly.<br>This was completely unbefitting of her previous coldness. That was why it caught the crowd&rsquo;s attention.<br>Unfortunately, after they examined the location where Chu Feng stood, they were unable to find anything.<br>Although they might all be stronger than Yin Zhuanghong, they did not have her special eyes.<br>Thus, they were simply unable to detect Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Master, I am fine.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that she had lost control of her emotions, Yin Zhuanghong immediately stopped smiling.<br>&ldquo;Perhaps Miss Yin is excessively happy to be able to be married to my disciple, and was momentarily unable to contain her emotions?&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a faint laugh was heard. It was Zhang Duotuo.<br>Once he said those words, Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s face immediately grew gloomy. In fact, Chu Feng noticed that all the people from the Red-dress Holy Land present had become displeased.<br>From the behavior of the people from the Red-dress Holy Land, it could be seen that they actually did not want Yin Zhuanghong to be married to Meng Rufei either. The only reason why they'd agreed to it was because they had no other option.<br>&ldquo;Miss Yin, please don&rsquo;t be so anxious. Once I settle the appointed gamble today, I will immediately consult with your headmaster and arrange a good date for my disciple to marry you," Zhang Duotuo said with a beaming smile.<br>Unable to contain himself, Chu Feng cursed out in his heart. &ldquo;Motherfucker! That old fart is doing that deliberately!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even a fool could tell that the Red-dress Holy Land is unwilling to marry Yin Zhuanghong to Meng Rufei, yet he&rsquo;s still saying such a thing in this place. How shameless can he be?!&rdquo;<br></p></div>
