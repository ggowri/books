        <div>: Certain Defeat<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Am I going to fall in defeat here? No, I can&rsquo;t lose here.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes hardened in determination.<br>He placed his hands together and began releasing waves of spirit power. It was as if he was a commander dispatching an army of soldiers against Zhuge Feiluan.<br>Whoosh!<br>The formation dragon began to dissipate, but it wasn&rsquo;t destroyed by Zhuge Feiluan&rsquo;s barrier. Chu Feng was releasing the formation on his own accord.<br>He absorbed the lingering spirit power from the formation dragon back into his body before compressing it together. If one were to take a closer look, one would notice that formation armor had started forming around Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>However, what was amazing about this armor was that it didn&rsquo;t just consist of a single layer. There were over a hundred layers, and it was still increasing by the second.<br>It was one thing if it was just simple formation armor, but every single layer of these armors were formations that could boost his spirit power. They were complementary and boosted each other&rsquo;s prowess.<br>&ldquo;That lad has such refined control over his spirit power?&rdquo;<br>The world spiritists present were skilled enough to see through the crux of Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation.<br>A single layer of the formation armor was nothing much; it was even weaker than the formation dragon Chu Feng had summoned earlier. However, their prowess could reach unimaginable levels when stacked together.<br>And it was still continuing to stack at a frightening speed even at this very second.<br>Soon, he had over two hundred layers of formation armor around him.<br>&ldquo;Formidable.&rdquo;<br>Even Zhuge Feiluan was impressed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s means.<br>As a world spiritist, he could tell that Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation armor was stressing his body, so there was a limit to how much he could stack.<br>An ordinary world spiritist would only be able to stack thirty layers. Those who could stack a hundred layers could be considered a prodigy. However, Chu Feng had already stacked up to three hundred layers in the blink of an eye, and he was still showing no signs of stopping.<br>This piqued Zhuge Feiluan&rsquo;s curiosity.<br>He wanted to know what Chu Feng&rsquo;s limit was.<br>&ldquo;Feiluan, why are you still waiting for?&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief urged with a hint of anger in his eyes.<br>Zhuge Feiluan didn&rsquo;t dare to dilly-dally any longer. His expression turned grave.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, pardon me.&rdquo;<br>Boom!<br>Zhuge Feiluan pushed his palms forward, propelling the barrier straight toward Chu Feng.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t wait passively for his opponent to bring the fight to him. Instead, he took a step forward and began charging toward the barrier with his hundreds of layers of formation armor.<br>Everyone stared at the fight intently, not wanting to miss a moment of their showdown.<br>Boom!<br>Soon, Chu Feng was already right in front of the barrier. He thrust his palms toward the barrier, producing a loud thump. It was strong enough to send a tremor through the barrier, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to shatter it.<br>In fact, the barrier continued to push Chu Feng back.<br>At this rate, Chu Feng would be pushed to the border of the spatial treasure till he was finally cornered and forced to surrender. That would spell his defeat.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&hellip; still stacking the formation armor?&rdquo;<br>The crowd soon realized that Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation armor was still increasing even though he had already made a move. The speed at which the stacks were forming had slowed, but by this point, it had already increased to four hundred.<br>And it was still increasing&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s no need to force yourself. You aren&rsquo;t a match for Feiluan. Admit defeat. Losing is not shameful.&rdquo;<br>Despite Chu Feng&rsquo;s amazing feat, the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief thought nothing about it. He even began to taunt him.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t without reason that he was so confident in Zhuge Feiluan.<br>Chu Feng was still continuing to stack his formation armor, but he remained helpless to the barrier. The barrier was simply too powerful.<br>Chu Feng was indeed growing stronger with each passing moment, but no matter how quickly a mere praying mantis grew, it could never hope to stand against an elephant.<br>While the crowd was amazed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s feat, they thought that the fight was already decided.<br>&ldquo;Zhuge Feiluan truly lives up to his reputation.&rdquo;<br>Forced back by the barrier, Chu Feng was already on the verge of reaching the spatial treasure&rsquo;s boundary. Shengguang Buyu felt anxious for Chu Feng, but he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel impressed by Zhuge Feiluan too.<br>As a world spiritist himself, he could tell that Chu Feng&rsquo;s skills surpassed that of ordinary prodigies. He could have won if his opponent was any other rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist, but Zhuge Feiluan was no ordinary prodigy either.<br>If Chu Feng had reached rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation, he might still stand a chance here. Unfortunately, he was only at rank four, and this gap had already determined the outcome of the battle.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s no shame in admitting defeat. Do you have to be defeated before you&rsquo;re willing to give up? That&rsquo;ll only be more embarrassing for you,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke up once more.<br>However, Chu Feng ignored him.<br>The speed at which he was stacking his formation armor slowed, but he was very close to manifesting five hundred of them.<br>Boom!<br>Just as he was about to reach the boundary of the spatial treasure, he planted his feet on the ground firmly, intending to use his physical body to make one last stand against the formation.<br>However, the crowd knew that it was futile.<br>Chu Feng had been helpless against the barrier all this while, and it was hard to imagine how he could turn the tables around at this point.<br>Princess Xiaoxiao turned her head away. She couldn&rsquo;t bear to watch this tragic sight. She didn&rsquo;t want to see Chu Feng being squeezed like a pancake against the boundary of the spatial treasure.<br>Boom!<br>A loud explosion suddenly echoed.<br>The crowd was flabbergasted.<br>Chu Feng actually managed to hold the barrier back with his physical might.<br>&ldquo;Feiluan, this duel concerns the reputation of our Zhuge Clan. If you hold back here, you won&rsquo;t just be embarrassing yourself but our entire Zhuge Clan!&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief bellowed.<br>Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t used the slightest sliver of his martial power thus far. Given so, it should be impossible for him to stop the barrier. So, he thought that Zhuge Feiluan was going easy on him.<br></p></div>
