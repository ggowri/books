        <div>: Emperor of Massacre<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Emperor of Massacre? Why does that name sound so familiar to me?&rdquo;<br>Eggy could see what Chu Feng saw, and she fell into deep thought upon seeing the contents on the scroll too. She felt like she had heard this name before somewhere.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, you don&rsquo;t remember the Emperor of Massacre anymore?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Are we acquainted with him?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;My dear Milady Queen, the Asura Ghost Tower of the Nine Provinces Continent, do you still remember it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Ohhhhhh! I remember it now! It&rsquo;s the one who left the couplet behind in the Asura Ghost Tower, right? I was wondering why it sounded so familiar. Hahaha, this Queen remembers it! I still remember the couplet too.<br>&ldquo;What are the truths in the journey of cultivation? Only I alone devote myself in killing monsters. In the world under heaven, who is the ruler? I slaughter my way to bring order to the universe.<br>&ldquo;Haha! Back then, I was still thinking that this fellow must be an arrogant one, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t have left behind something like this. He even named himself Emperor of Massacre; what a dolt!&rdquo; Eggy remarked cheerfully.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, you shouldn&rsquo;t say that. Back then, when I first saw those words left behind by the Emperor of Massacre, I felt a jolt to my soul. It&rsquo;s my first time feeling that there&rsquo;s a much larger world out there. Those words had given me the motivation to work harder in my cultivation,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Alright alright, I&rsquo;m just joking. I&rsquo;m not trying to disrespect him here. But speaking of which, Chu Feng, is this Emperor of Massacre here really the same Emperor of Massacre from the Asura Ghost Tower? After all, this place is very different from the Asura Ghost Tower. Could they just have similar names with one another?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;Earlier, when I saw the words on the plaques, I was already thinking that they looked quite familiar. Right now, I&rsquo;m certain that they are of the same handwriting as the couplets we saw in the Asura Ghost Tower. At the very least, I can confirm that they came from the same person,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;If they really came from the same person, this Emperor of Massacre must be a truly formidable individual. At the very least, he&rsquo;s an extremely powerful Asura World Spiritist. Is it possible that the evil spirits here were sealed off by him?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t shrug off such a possibility.&rdquo;<br>In truth, that was also what Chu Feng was thinking of too. He had a feeling that the formation here could have been constructed by the Emperor of Massacre too.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, we have prepared for this day for over a thousand years now. Over the past ten years, we worked ourselves down to the bone for this moment. Whether our Asura World Spirit Army will see the light of the day once more, and whether we&rsquo;ll gain independence or not depends on how everything goes this time.<br>&ldquo;Failure is not an option. We have to succeed in order to leave this place. Are you all ready?&rdquo; the Asura King suddenly asked loudly.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready! We&rsquo;ll give everything we can at your command, and we won&rsquo;t back down till our deaths!&rdquo;<br>As if the rumbling of thousands of thunder, the voices of the evil spirits present shook the massive hall.<br>This wasn&rsquo;t just a response to the Asura King; it also represented their determination too!<br>&ldquo;Very well. Today, we, standing upon the King&rsquo;s Stand, shall give our all so that we can see the light of the day once more. Once we destroy all obstacles in our way, we shall dye the blue sky red with blood!<br>&ldquo;Activate the formation!!!!&rdquo;<br>The sky and earth tremored as black aura burst forth with a terrifying roar from the Asura King. The black aura swiftly gushed into the half scroll.<br>Weng!<br>As energy rushed into the scroll, the formation within it began to float out, converting from mere words into a corporeal form, swiftly enveloping the King&rsquo;s Stand.<br>Weng!<br>With the unleashing of the formation, the King&rsquo;s Stand emanated a brilliant outburst of light as the formation inscribed on top of it resonated into activation too.<br>&ldquo;Once we destroy all obstacles in our way, we shall dye the blue sky red with blood!&rdquo;<br>All of the Asura Evil Spirits echoed the shouts from the Asura King, their voices tinged with excitement, rage, and murderous intent.<br>At this very moment, everyone in the formation core quickly crossed their legs and sat down as they infused their energy into the formation cores beneath them. They were providing the energy required to drive the massive formation on the King&rsquo;s Stand.<br>&ldquo;So this formation requires the very energy of the Asura Evil Spirits. It&rsquo;s no wonder why I felt that ordinary world spiritist techniques wouldn&rsquo;t work on it.&rdquo;<br>Despite understanding the principles involved here, he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel even more unnerved than before. The pulsations of energy that the King&rsquo;s Stand was releasing right now was extremely terrifying. The Asura Evil Spirits pooling their powers together was truly no joke at all.<br>And when they shouted the chant &lsquo;Once we destroy all obstacles in our way, we&rsquo;ll surely dye the blue sky red with blood!&rsquo;, their intent was made perfectly clear.<br>No matter whose blood they were referring to, it couldn&rsquo;t possibly be their own. If they were planning to deal with an archenemy to vent their anger, their feelings were still understandable. However, if it was just blind rage that was driving them, and they had no qualms killing the innocent too, this would really be a huge catastrophe for the world.<br>These Asura Evil Spirits were terrifyingly powerful. Once released, it was hard to imagine anyone who could stop them.<br>And while Chu Feng was still worrying over this matter, the energy in the formation was swiftly concentrating beneath the feet of the Asura King, surging toward the sealed box.<br>Boom!<br>The box began to tremor intensely, as if something terrifying was on the verge of bursting forth. The feeling of unease in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart was swiftly intensifying.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, something feels wrong here. The item that they are planning to release; is it going to free them from their restraints and allow them to leave the Asura Graveyard?<br>&ldquo;Putting aside what that item is, just these Evil Asura Spirits are already a nightmare to deal with. Is there really anyone in the Nine Souls Galaxy who could stop them?&rdquo;<br>Realizing that something was amiss, Eggy quickly warned Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I think the item is the box is the item which the Wretched Black Demon wants me to steal. Since it&rsquo;s stealable, I reckon that it won&rsquo;t be breaking free of its seal today,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a frown.<br>&ldquo;But the Wretched Black Demon isn&rsquo;t a good person either. Even if we steal this box from these Asura Evil Spirits, we mustn&rsquo;t hand it over to him. Otherwise, who knows what kind of bad things he&rsquo;ll do with it,&rdquo; Eggy warned.<br>&ldquo;As expected of Milady Queen, we do share the same thoughts with one another!&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>As the power on the King&rsquo;s Stand continued to surge toward the sealed box, the inscriptions on the sealed box began to light up. Before long, 90% of it had already lit up.<br>However, the final 10% refused to light up even after some time later. It felt that everything was going to come to an end with this when&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Yunliang, it&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;<br>After confirming that the final 10% wasn&rsquo;t lighting up, the Asura King turned to Lord Yunliang, who immediately took the bottle he had prepared out. He uncorked the lid and activated the formation within the bottle.<br>The energy within the bottle immediately drifted out and fused into the formation of the King&rsquo;s Stand before surging into the box through the formation.<br>Weng!<br>Slowly, the final 10% of the inscriptions started lighting up too.<br>Seeing this, the lips of the Asura King began curling upward into a smile. He quickly retracted his energy and stopped the formation in the half scroll, which, in turn, caused the formation on the King&rsquo;s Stand to screech to a halt. Everything simply dissipated just like this.<br>The Asura Evil Spirits also stopped infusing their energy into the formation too. Even so, they were all panting heavily, such that even their auras had turned frail.<br>Even someone as strong as Lord Yunliang was no exception.<br>They appeared to be in a similar state as Wang Yuxian and the others when they had their bloodline powers forcefully sapped from them, but of course, their conditions were still slightly better.<br>Nevertheless, this showed that the activation of the formation was no easy feat for them at all.<br>It was no wonder why they would say words like they wouldn&rsquo;t retreat until their final breath. From the look of it, they had known that the activation of the formation would deplete their energy greatly. They were resolved to go to the end if that was what was needed to complete the ritual.<br>None of the Asura Evil Spirits looked relieved even after the formation had stopped. Instead, they were all looking at the Asura King nervously.<br>&ldquo;My king, is it a success?&rdquo;<br>Unable to take the suspense anymore, someone asked carefully.<br>&ldquo;We have already done all we can. As for the rest&hellip; it depends on the will of heaven,&rdquo; the Asura King sighed with a smile.<br>His words brought about looks of excitement and happiness on the Evil Asura Spirits. In fact, some of them even began shedding tears.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, you have worked hard today. You may return to rest. Make sure to recuperate well. A month from now, the answer will unfold by itself. Perhaps, that would be the day that our Asura World Spirit Army returns back to the world above!&rdquo;<br>With the command from the Asura King, the Evil Asura Spirits swiftly took their leaves. Lord Yunliang also brought Chu Feng out of the Asura King Palace too.<br>However, the Asura King didn&rsquo;t seem to be showing any signs of leaving the area.<br></p></div>
