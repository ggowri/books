        <h1>Chapter 5728: Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Totem Galaxy, the ancestral dragon&rsquo;s forbidden land&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An aged Long Lin rose into the sky. He had just stabilized the formation Chu Feng had left behind, so he didn&rsquo;t have to infuse his bloodline power in anymore. He was also using his means to observe the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike others, the earlier voice had struck terror in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Long Lin&hellip;&rdquo; a weak voice suddenly echoed below, causing Long Lin&rsquo;s body to shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Lin widened his eyes in shock, as his expression stiffened up. He froze up as if he had been petrified. The voice sounded so familiar yet distant that he didn&rsquo;t know if he was hearing things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is it you, Long Lin?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only when the voice sounded once more that Long Lin lowered his head to take a look. Much to his delight, Long Xue had really awakened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Xue&rsquo;er</span><span>!&rdquo; Long Lin quickly descended to Long Xue&rsquo;s side with reddened eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After so long, Long Xue had finally regained consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&hellip; Why did you age so much? Was I asleep for a long time?&rdquo; Long Xue felt pained and confused to see Long Lin in his current state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Xue&rsquo;er</span><span>, I wasn&rsquo;t young in the first place. Isn&rsquo;t this for the best?&rdquo; Long Lin said with a smile as he grabbed Long Xue&rsquo;s hand to check on her condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that even though her illness hadn&rsquo;t been treated at its root yet, her condition was many times better than before. It wasn&rsquo;t a coincidence that she regained consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did a closer inspection of Long Xue&rsquo;s body, and his expression stiffened up. He realized her condition improved because something had suppressed her illness. It was a formation hidden in her body&mdash;Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on him that Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t lie to him; the inspection really treated Long Xue&rsquo;s illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng&hellip;&rdquo; Long Lin lowered his head in shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng was traveling through a teleportation passageway in a ship. The Totem Dragon Clansmen were all aboard the ship, recuperating in a recovery formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was heading off to look for Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that this realm was unlikely to be peaceful after what happened earlier, so he had to quickly find Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> and escape from this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the voice, Chu Feng quickly turned around and supported the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief up as he asked, &ldquo;Elder, you&rsquo;re awake. How are you feeling?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m fine. Thank you for saving our lives. If not for you, our Totem Dragon Clan would have been over,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said as he glanced at their surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of his clansmen were seated inside a recovery formation, but Chu Feng had done far more than that for them. If not for Chu Feng, they would have all been dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, I am only doing what I should. I trust that </span><span>Brother</span><span> Chengyu and the others would do the same if anything happens to me too,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief smiled in response. He knew that his son was a loyal fellow too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m truly curious about, if you don&rsquo;t mind me asking,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Feel free to speak your mind, elder.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your background?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had witnessed the lightning energy in person, and he could sense how terrifying it was even though his cultivation had been sealed off. It was evident that Chu Feng had someone powerful backing him, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t have such a formidable protection formation in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Our clan is a normal clan in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. The protection formation was left by my father,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied truthfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the world of cultivation knew his identity now, so there was no need for him to hide the truth from the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Your father?&rdquo; The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was slightly taken aback to learn that the protection formation was from Chu Feng&rsquo;s father. Despite being a galaxy overlord, a pinnacle True God level cultivation, he asked with a respectful tone, &ldquo;May I know your father&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that formation had really come from Chu Feng&rsquo;s father, it would mean that the latter&rsquo;s formation had exceeded True God level, reaching the ranks of Heavenly God level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were no known Heavenly God level cultivators in the current world of cultivation, not even among the galaxy overlords. The closest thing was speculation that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had a Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist in their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s name is Chu </span><span>Xuanyuan</span><span>,&rdquo; Chu Feng honestly replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu </span><span>Xuanyuan</span><span>?&rdquo; The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief racked his brain, but he didn&rsquo;t know anyone who went by such a name. &ldquo;It looks like your father maintains a low profile.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, my father is rather low profile.&rdquo; Chu Feng knew that his father went around with an alias. He suddenly thought of something and asked, &ldquo;Elder, have you met the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the earlier formation, he learned that his father was extremely strong, most likely having reached Heavenly God level. Otherwise, there was no way he could construct such a powerful martial power formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, his father was unable to save his mother in spite of his strength. This could only mean that there was someone stronger in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He figured that the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief might know a thing or two about this matter. Given that the Totem Dragon Clan was now indebted to him, the latter might be willing to divulge confidential secrets about the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I have never met that person, but there is a good chance that there&rsquo;s a Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&hellip; and that person is unlikely to be any ordinary Heavenly Dragon World Spiritist,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What makes you say so?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;My grandfather is a cultivator, but he&rsquo;s fond of world spiritist techniques. His eyes became exceptionally sharp after he obtained a treasure. He often stayed over in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and examined it using the treasure, hoping to see if he could decipher any of their exclusive formations. He didn&rsquo;t get much out of it, but he </span><span>did reap some rewards, and that only made him even more adamant about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;One day, an uninvited guest wielding a lightning God Armament arrived at the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and killed anyone who came into his line of sight. My grandfather couldn&rsquo;t hear their conversation as he was too far away, but he could make out his words through lip reading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The name of the uninvited guest was Huangfu </span><span>Shangting</span><span>. He has gone into seclusion, but the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion dug up his place, so he killed everyone who trespassed on his territory. However, that wasn&rsquo;t enough to quell his anger, so he marched to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion with the intent of wiping them out from the face of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;And that man was a Heavenly God level cultivator,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What happened next?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Huangfu </span><span>Shangting</span><span> slaughtered his way into the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, so my grandfather couldn&rsquo;t see what was going on anymore. However, the matter ended right there. There was no follow up&mdash;outsiders didn&rsquo;t know about the matter, and the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion continues to stand strong to this day,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;In other words, Huangfu </span><span>Shangting</span><span> has been killed? This would mean that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion either has the means or personnel to deal with Heavenly God level cultivators,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You can say so. My grandfather didn&rsquo;t publicly speak of this matter as he didn&rsquo;t want to draw the ire of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but regardless, they aren&rsquo;t as simple as they seem. In fact, it&rsquo;s common knowledge that the waters of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion run deeper than it looks. Why else do you think no one dares to mess with them?&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span></p></div>
