        <h1>Chapter 4889</h1>
        <div>: Bizarre Black Gate<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom boom boom!<br>The ground suddenly started violently rattling. Blinding light rose from the ground and enveloped the entire palace.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a formation,&rdquo; Shengguang Chuyao said.<br>The other juniors could also tell as much too. The light was coming from special runes inscribed on the ground. These runes harnessed a tremendous amount of spirit power, hinting at the might of the formation.<br>The crowd started off by staring at the runes with anticipation, thinking that there was a fortuitous encounter right ahead of them. However, they soon noticed that something was amiss.<br>The runes were slowly turning pitch-black, forming a black spiral on the ground. It looked like the abyss, and it was dragging them in. The force wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to sweep them in right away, but it was definitely slowly pulling them in.<br>&ldquo;Miss Menglai, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>The juniors of the Holy Valley turned to Shengguang Menglai.<br>However, Shengguang Menglai wasn&rsquo;t able to see through the current situation either. All she could tell was that the black spiral dragging them in was extremely dangerous.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to panic. I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; a calm voice suddenly sounded.<br>It was Chu Feng.<br>Weng!<br>The moment Chu Feng spoke up, a burst of blinding light exploded from where he was. Taking a closer look, the light looked similar to the waterfall of light earlier.<br>It seemed like the power of the waterfall of light was now gathered within Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>He formed a series of hand seals before directing his palm toward the black spiral below.<br>&ldquo;Break!!!&rdquo;<br>Boom!<br>A constant stream of light gushed from Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm into the black spiral, slowly filling it up with light. When it was finally suffusing with light, the area finally reverted back to normal. At the same time, a formation of light emerged on the ground.<br>This formation was different from the earlier black spiral. It didn&rsquo;t feel dangerous; on the contrary, it felt divine.<br>Boom!<br>Soon after, the formation of light began to quiver, causing spirit formation gates to rise from the ground.<br>There were a total of a hundred spirit formation gates, corresponding to the number of juniors present on the spot. However, there seemed to be something peculiar about these spirit formation gates.<br>They were colored white, blue, golden, or black, and every single one of them emanated different auras. Of the gates, black was the most dangerous whereas white was the safest. Blue gave off an air of serenity but golden was the most appealing one.<br>However, there were only two golden spirit formation gates in total.<br>&ldquo;Each person can only enter one spirit formation gate. Other than those two golden gates, which are available to only Shengguang Haoxuan and Shengguang Xintian, you can take your pick of any of the gates present,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Ssss!&rdquo;<br>Everyone looked at Shengguang Haoxuan and Shengguang Xintian in envy. While they were forcefully thrown into the yellow fecal lake by Chu Feng, they were obtaining benefits that none of them were entitled to here.<br>It was clear that the fortuitous encounter provided by the golden spirit formation gate was the greatest of all, and there was none amongst them who wouldn&rsquo;t want to enter it.<br>Yet, they were only available to Shengguang Haoxuan and Shengguang Xintian.<br>All of the juniors turned to look at the two of them, and they thought about their earlier attitude toward Chu Feng. They couldn&rsquo;t help but think that the two of them had gone overboard with Chu Feng earlier.<br>Chu Feng was indeed a little forceful, but he never tried to harm them. Instead, he had even helped them.<br>&ldquo;See, Xuanhao and Xintian! The golden spirit formation gates are bound to contain great fortuitous encounters, but only the two of you are entitled to it. If not for Brother Chu Feng throwing the two of you into the yellow lake, you would have missed this opportunity too. You should hurry up and thank Brother Chu Feng!&rdquo; Shengguang Chuyao said.<br>However, Shengguang Haoxuan simply rolled his eyes. How could he possibly thank Chu Feng?<br>Most of the juniors of the Holy Valley also thought that Shengguang Chuyao&rsquo;s words were excessive.<br>It was one thing if it had been anyone else, but Shengguang Haoxuan and Shengguang Xintian were of lofty backgrounds. They were known to be hot-tempered individuals who couldn&rsquo;t care less about being reasonable.<br>Anyone else amongst them could have thanked Chu Feng, but not them.<br>&ldquo;Aiyo, I guess I was really being ungrateful here.&rdquo;<br>Yet, something shocking happened. Shengguang Xintian actually turned to Chu Feng and admitted her own mistakes.<br>What was even shocking was that she didn&rsquo;t seem unwilling to do it at all. On the contrary, there was a faint smile on her face.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what kind of grudge you had with my grandfather, but there&rsquo;s nothing between the two of us in the first place. I was too unreasonable earlier, but you&rsquo;re a man, after all. You should be magnanimous and not hold a grudge against a woman, especially one as cute as me. Let&rsquo;s treat it as if the events earlier didn&rsquo;t happen, alright?&rdquo;<br>On top of the smile, Shengguang Xintian&rsquo;s words and expressions looked coy. Her transformation surprised the juniors of the Holy Valley, as well as Yu Sha.<br>&ldquo;Why is that woman changing her tune all of a sudden? Chu Feng, you need to tread carefully around her. She might be up to something,&rdquo; Yu She reminded.<br>&ldquo;Up to something? Yu Sha, you&rsquo;re thinking too much. I reckon that she&rsquo;s the type of person who bows not to the carrot but the stick. Those who remain courteous with her will never be able to earn her respect. Instead, it&rsquo;s those who prove that they are no pushovers that can win her admiration,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Are you serious? There are actually such people in the world?&rdquo;<br>Yu Sha found it unbelievable.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know either. I&rsquo;m just guessing,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Yu Sha was rendered speechless.<br>&ldquo;Just ignore her. Even if she&rsquo;s thinking of pulling something, the one who&rsquo;ll suffer in the end is still her,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied before turning to Shengguang Xintian.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. My grudge with your grandfather shouldn&rsquo;t affect us. If you hadn&rsquo;t used your grandfather to threaten me earlier, I wouldn&rsquo;t have made a move on you earlier. Still, it&rsquo;s a fact that you attempted to kill me earlier on. It&rsquo;s already out of utmost tolerance on my part that I spared your life.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the habit of harping on the past, but as I&rsquo;ve said earlier, I won&rsquo;t stand for it a second time. If you dare to do it again, regardless of how beautiful you think you are, I won&rsquo;t show any mercy,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Alright, alright. I got it. There&rsquo;s no need to be so fierce. Didn&rsquo;t anyone tell you that you ought to be gentle when it comes to girls? Speaking of which, Chu Feng, do we have to enter these spirit formation gates to cultivate now?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xintian was still hiding behind Shengguang Menglai a moment earlier out of fear of Chu Feng, but at this moment, she actually ran over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side. The sudden change in attitude from her was really jaw-dropping.<br>The crowd could hardly believe just how fast her face was changing.<br>After all, she was still threatening to take Chu Feng&rsquo;s life a moment ago.<br>Why would she suddenly act so chummy with her all of a sudden? Those who didn&rsquo;t know better would have thought that they had always been on good terms with each other.<br>&ldquo;A person can only enter each spirit formation gate,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, what about those black spirit formation gates? Why are they emanating such a dangerous aura?&rdquo; Shengguang Chuyao asked.<br>That was actually the question that everyone wanted to ask. Those black spirit formation gates felt too sinister that they unnerved them.<br></p></div>
