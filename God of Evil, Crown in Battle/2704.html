        <h1>Chapter 2703</h1>
        <div> - The Hunt Begins<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>In the following days, more and more participants arrived at the Immortal Armament Villa.<br>Chu Feng roughly estimated that there were hundreds of thousands of people gathered here to participate in the hunt.<br>While there were hundreds of thousands of world spiritists, only a hundred individuals would be able to obtain rewards.<br>Chu Feng did not understand why so many people would come to participate in the hunt. The reason for that was because there were people among them who were very low level world spiritists.<br>With their strength, not to mention reaching the top one hundred, it would be dangerous for them to even enter the hunting grounds.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had already come to know about the rules and methods of the hunt.<br>This so-called hunting ground was actually a vast spirit formation. That spirit formation formed a small-scale isolated world.<br>Only people who were younger than a hundred years old were capable of entering the world. Furthermore, their martial power would be suppressed, making it so that they could only use their world spirit techniques.<br>What the participants needed to do was to use their world spirit techniques to capture prey.<br>As for their so-called prey, they were World Spirit Beasts. Those World Spirit Beasts were actually also spirit formations. They were actually not real living beasts.<br>Since they were spirit formations, they needed to be given orders. As for the orders given to those World Spirit Beasts, it was to attack all living things they encountered. Thus, if one were to encounter a powerful World Spirit Beast and not possess sufficient strength to contend against it, one would be out of luck.<br>After a World Spirit Beast was killed, they would turn into World Spirit Bones.<br>The amount of World Spirit Bones they would turn into after dying would depend on the strength of the World Spirit Beast.<br>In short, the rankings of the hunt would be determined by the amount of World Spirit Bones one obtained from the hunt.<br>As for the hunt itself, it would last for ten days. After ten days passed, the grand formation&rsquo;s exit would be opened, and the participants would be able to exit.<br>However, reportedly, this year&rsquo;s hunt would be different from previous years. There would be a special reward.<br>Reportedly, this reward was of considerable value. Its value was even comparable to the first place prize.<br>Merely, no one knew what sort of reward it was.<br>Thus, they were all guessing as to what the reward might be.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, that special reward should be what that girl mentioned to you, right?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;If she didn&rsquo;t deceive me, that should be the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Do you think she lied to you?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;I feel that she most likely didn&rsquo;t lie to me this time,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Finally, the day of the hunt arrived. Hundreds of thousands of people under a hundred years of age were gathered at a vast field outside the Immortal Armament Villa.<br>Everyone was filled with eagerness. Excitement and nervousness covered their faces.<br>One thing worthy of mentioning was that Song Xi did not plan to participate in the hunt. From this, it could be seen that Song Xi knew his own abilities a lot more than many of the people present.<br>Soon, an elder from the Immortal Armament Villa walked out.<br>That elder was an old man with long fiery-red hair, a fiery-red beard and a black gown.<br>His voice was very powerful and resounding. It was like a beast&rsquo;s roar. With that powerful voice of his, he began to narrate the rules of the hunt to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;I hereby announce the official start of this hunt.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, that old man spread open his palm. Then, a sphere of light appeared in his palm.<br>After that, he tossed the sphere of light onto the ground.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>A loud explosion was heard, and then that sphere of light started to rapidly grow larger. In the blink of an eye, it turned into a body of light with a diameter of over a thousand meters.<br>It was a world spirit gate. On the other side of that world spirit gate was the hunting grounds.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>At that moment, everyone started to soar into the sky flying toward that giant world spirit gate, which was emitting a brilliant light.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng noticed that there were people who managed to successfully pass through the world spirit gate, whereas there were also people that were knocked back from the world spirit gate, as if they had bumped into a vast layer of cotton.<br>For the people that were knocked back, they were unable to enter the world spirit gate no matter how many times they tried. Time and time again, they continued to be knocked back.<br>It was only at that moment that Chu Feng realized that not everyone could enter the hunting grounds.<br>According to Chu Feng&rsquo;s observation, while there were hundreds of thousands of people present, only ten or twenty thousand people would be able to enter the hunting grounds.<br>The reason for that was because that world spirit gate should possess a detection ability. Only those that possessed world spirit energy that met its standards would be able to enter the hunting grounds.<br>Chu Feng felt that that sort of method was very good. At least&hellip; it would prevent those with insufficient strength from entering and potentially dying inside.<br>&ldquo;Brother, what are you looking at?&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Song Xi.<br>Although Song Xi was not planning to participate, he had come with Chu Feng. He was planning to see Chu Feng off.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering if they will try to attack me,&rdquo; Song Xi said in a slightly cowardly manner.<br>It turned out that he was looking at a viewing platform floating in the sky.<br>On that viewing platform were some elders from the Immortal Armament Villa, as well as the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>However, apart from the people from the Immortal Armament Villa, there were several dozen members of the younger generation that were not from the Immortal Armament Villa on that viewing platform too. Those were the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>The people from the Chu Heavenly Clan truly possessed noble statuses. Regardless of where they were, they would receive the treatment of honored guests.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. After I enter, you merely need to return to the Immortal Armament Villa. They most likely won&rsquo;t do anything to you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well. In that case, Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll return to the Immortal Armament Villa right now,&rdquo; Song Xi said.<br>He was truly scared. He would be even more scared once Chu Feng left his side.<br>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng raised his head and looked to Chu Xianshuo and the others. Then, he soared into the sky and flew toward the world spirit gate leading to the hunting grounds.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Xianshuo, I seemed to have seen that brat just now,&rdquo; a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation on the viewing platform declared.<br>&ldquo;Which brat?&rdquo; Chu Xianshuo asked.<br>&ldquo;That brat by the name of Chu Feng,&rdquo; that person replied.<br>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s that bastard. He actually still hasn&rsquo;t run the hell away from this place? He dared to come and participate in the hunt? He truly does not know how to write the character death,&rdquo; Chu Xianshuo said mockingly.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Xianshuo, we&rsquo;ll enter and teach him a lesson right away,&rdquo; several members of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation stood up.<br>&ldquo;Are you all capable of taking care of him?&rdquo; Chu Xianshuo asked.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Xianshuo, don&rsquo;t forget that while this hunting grounds is the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s treasure, it has always been our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory. How could we not be able to take care of that brat in our own territory? You are looking down on us too much,&rdquo; a person from the group said.<br>&ldquo;Haha, go on ahead. All of you, go and take care of him. Make sure to not disgrace our Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Xianshuo said.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Xianshuo, please rest assured. When have we ever disappointed you?&rdquo;<br>After that, those members of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation all flew toward the world spirit gate. Only Chu Xianshuo remained on the viewing platform. He had a leisurely and carefree expression on his face.<br>&ldquo;Brother Xianshuo, are you planning to wait until the last day to enter this time too?&rdquo; A member of the younger generation from the Immortal Armament Villa asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve obtained first place every time I entered, why then must I rush to enter? With the extra time I have, it is better that I spend it here relaxing,&rdquo; Chu Xianshuo said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Brother Xianshuo is extremely powerful. Simply no one is able to contend against you. Every time you&rsquo;ve entered, you&rsquo;ve been able to completely sweep through the entire hunting ground. Even we felt inferior by comparison,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s younger generations all laughed in agreement.<br>Then, they began to flatter Chu Xianshuo through various means.<br><br><br></p></div>
