        <h1>Chapter 3810</h1>
        <div> - Deception<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;So-so,&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke in a very calm manner.<br>&ldquo;So-so? Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, that person let out a cold chuckle. Then, his clothes started to flutter, and the spirit power that had enveloped his body rushed towards Chu Feng to attack him.<br>He was evidently angered by Chu Feng&rsquo;s reaction. Thus, he wanted to make him pay.<br>However, although his spirit power swept past Chu Feng, it was unable to beat him back.<br>His spirit power was actually blocked by Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was enveloped with spirit power. It was his spirit power that had blocked the man&rsquo;s attack.<br>However, even though they were both Saint-cloak World Spiritists, that man&rsquo;s spirit power was Snake Mark, whereas Chu Feng's was only Insect Mark.<br>&ldquo;He actually managed to block the attack of a Snake Mark world spiritist with Insect Mark spirit power? Amazing. That&rsquo;s simply too powerful, no?&rdquo;<br>The crowd burst into a commotion. Countless voices of alarm could be heard.<br>The crowd were all world spiritists. Thus, they knew very well how great the disparity between different levels of world spiritists was.<br>Even though world spiritists of the same level also had disparities in strength, it was simply impossible for a world spiritist of a lower level to contend against another world spiritist of a higher level.<br>Yet, Chu Feng had actually managed to block an attack made with Snake Mark Spirit Power with his Insect Mark spirit power.<br>Chu Feng had not only broadened the crowd&rsquo;s horizons, but he had also brought them extreme shock.<br>&ldquo;Brat, you&rsquo;re truly not one to be looked down on.&rdquo;<br>It was not only the people of the younger generation. Even the Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist fighting Chu Feng revealed a look of shock in his eyes.<br>Soon, fierceness replaced the shock in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re so capable, I shall see if you&rsquo;re truly able to contend against my Snake Mark spirit power.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, spirit power was released from that man&rsquo;s palms repeatedly. His spirit power rushed forward to bombard Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm that held the World Spirit Jade.<br>Chu Feng did not cower. He too unleashed his spirit power to contend against that man.<br>Like tides, the two men&rsquo;s spirit power collided. Powerful surging spirit power filled the surrounding area of a thousand meters.<br>Chu Feng had actually managed to reach a stalemate against a Snake Mark-level world spiritist with his Insect Mark-level spirit power.<br>That said, no matter how powerful Chu Feng might be, he was still at a disadvantage.<br>In the beginning, Chu Feng was able to contend against that Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist. However, as time passed, his spirit power started getting beaten back. Furthermore, his arm was also completely enveloped by that man&rsquo;s spirit power.<br>That man had turned his spirit power into flames that began to burn Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm.<br>However, even with that, Chu Feng still did not cower.<br>&ldquo;Young man, to know when to retreat and avoid defeat is a good thing. That stubbornness of yours is completely meaningless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is still not too late to pull back. Otherwise, you won't be able to keep that arm of yours.&rdquo;<br>That man&rsquo;s words were filled with mockery. More than that, he was immensely pleased with himself.<br>Chu Feng did not respond. However, a look of determination appeared in his eyes.<br>That came from Chu Feng&rsquo;s stubbornness.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let me out.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded in Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>That voice was from the world spirit inside his body, Yu Sha.<br>Yu Sha had witnessed everything Chu Feng had experienced. His opponent was bullying him. Yu Sha was unable to stand by idly and watch anymore.<br>&ldquo;Girl, this place has not only sealed martial power, but it has also sealed world spirit gates.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;World spiritists are unable to rely on any other power here. They can only rely on their spirit power,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;In that case, you can let go,&rdquo; said Yu Sha.<br>&ldquo;That thing is mine. I will not easily let go of it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No one can easily snatch something that belongs to me from my hands.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words to Yu Sha, Chu Feng looked to that world spiritist, his opponent.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve remembered you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; That man felt rather confused by Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;Clamor~~~&rdquo;<br>However, in the next moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm that had been holding onto the World Spirit Jade shattered and turned to ashes that scattered onto the ground.<br>As for Chu Feng, he took several steps back with a look of pain on his face.<br>Seeing that, the man let out a light chuckle. His laughter was filled with complacence.<br>In the end, he was the one who had won the battle. This outcome brought great satisfaction to him.<br>Although he was satisfied, Chu Feng&hellip; was extremely dissatisfied.<br>Chu Feng took a glance at the ashes that were previously his arm and then looked back to that man. Gnashing his teeth, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve remembered you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll wait for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you want revenge, I welcome you at any time. I only fear that your outcome next time around will be even more miserable than this time. Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>That man laughed loudly, and then retrieved the World Spirit Jade and put it away. Then, he started walking to a spirit formation gate at the end of the plaza.<br>&ldquo;Little brother, your defeat today is not humiliating either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right. It&rsquo;s not humiliating. It&rsquo;s simply that you were asking for it. Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The remaining ten also followed that man and left.<br>However, they all mocked and ridiculed Chu Feng before leaving.<br>Facing their ridicules, the anger on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face grew more and more intense.<br>However, the more furious Chu Feng became, the more heartily those men laughed.<br>Chu Feng glared fiercely at those men. He looked on as they disappeared into the spirit formation gate one after another.<br>When the final individual disappeared into the spirit formation gate, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression suddenly changed completely.<br>The anger completely disappeared from his face, and the corners of his lips rose into a faint smile.<br>With a thought, the ashes on the ground immediately soared up and formed an arm that reconnected with Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>Not only was Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm completely fine, but even his clothes were undamaged.<br>&ldquo;Amazing. So Milord&rsquo;s arm was actually not injured.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be, what happened earlier was a trick, and those people have been duped?&rdquo;<br>The people of the younger generation present all revealed looks of shock as they saw this.<br>Chu Feng let out a faint smile. Then, he flipped his arm, and an item appeared in his hand. It was the World Spirit Jade.<br>&ldquo;That is&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all stunned upon seeing the World Spirit Jade. They were completely confused as to what had happened.<br>The World Spirit Jade Chu Feng held in his hand, both in terms of its aura and its appearance, was exactly the same as the one that was snatched earlier.<br>&ldquo;Milord, what is going on here?&rdquo; The crowd asked in confusion.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, help me with one thing. If they are to return, do not tell them of my whereabouts.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words to the crowd, his body shifted, and he disappeared.<br>Seeing this, the crowd became even more confused. Chu Feng had disappeared without a trace. They simply don&rsquo;t know where he had gone.<br>They were all confused by his words. Why did Chu Feng ask them not to tell those people his whereabouts should they return?<br>&ldquo;Bastard!&rdquo;<br>Soon, a furious shout was heard.<br>Turning towards the voice, the crowd discovered a figure appearing from the spirit formation gate located deep in the plaza.<br>That person was the person who had snatched the World Spirit Jade from Chu Feng earlier.<br>The crowd were still unable to see his face. That said, they were able to sense his anger from the tone of his voice.<br>That person looked around the plaza. He seemed to be searching for something.<br>&ldquo;Haha. Brother Song, you&rsquo;ve truly disgraced yourself. You actually allowed a person of the younger generation to dupe you.&rdquo;<br>Soon, the other ten people also walked out of the spirit formation gate in succession.<br>They were laughing heartily. Their laughter was filled with mockery.<br>Seeing that, the bewildered crowd came to a sudden realization.<br>It turned out that Chu Feng had put on a disguise earlier.<br>That man had not managed to snatch the actual World Spirit Jade. The actual World Spirit Jade was hidden away by Chu Feng.<br>It turned out that Chu Feng was not actually fighting him when they were fighting earlier. Instead, he was setting up a concealment formation to deceive everyone and dupe that man.<br>Realizing the truth, the people of the younger generation present all felt extreme admiration for Chu Feng.<br>It was already extremely amazing to be able to contend against a Snake Mark as an Insect Mark.<br>Yet, while he was fighting against a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he was able to even set up a concealment formation to deceive that Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, leading him to suffer. That was no longer a single act of amazingness.<br>That was simply something that should be impossible.<br>Yet, such a thing had happened.<br></p></div>
