        <h1>Chapter 5287</h1>
        <div>: Expelled<br>&ldquo;Elite Token? They managed to get a good place in the tournament?&rdquo;<br>Many of the juniors gathered around them were eliminated right away, so they didn&rsquo;t understand the significance of the Elite Token. They inferred from the name that it was an outstanding achievement.<br>However, Mo Yuhan sneered in disdain, &ldquo;Elite Token? Isn&rsquo;t that just a consolation prize?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Miss Mo, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Both Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo&rsquo;s complexion turned awful. They knew that it was a consolation prize, but the Trial of the Strongest was a gathering of the Totem Galaxy&rsquo;s strongest cultivators. It was already an achievement to receive the Elite Token, so they felt indignant when Mo Yuhan put them down.<br>That being said, they dared not to talk back to her. After all, this was Mo Yuhan they were talking about. They were just bewildered as to why Mo Yuhan was suddenly taking a hostile attitude toward them.<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but burst into laughter. His outburst created an opportunity for Zhao Yunmo and Cheng Tianchan to vent their anger.<br>&ldquo;What are you laughing about? No matter how weak we are, we have at least obtained an Elite Token. That&rsquo;s much better than those who didn&rsquo;t receive anything at all. Did you get an Elite Token too?&rdquo; Zhao Yunmo roared.<br>Chu Feng smiled at him and replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that I didn&rsquo;t receive an Elite Token.&rdquo;<br>Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo broke out into triumphant smiles, but before they could say anything, Chu Feng took out a token and added, &ldquo;But I have this.&rdquo;<br>With the exception of Mo Yuhan and Long Xiaoxiao, everyone in the vicinity was shocked when they took a closer look at the token. It was the Strongest Token for the late Martial Exalted level category.<br>&ldquo;He&hellip; is the champion of the late Martial Exalted level category?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who is he? Why have I never seen him before?&rdquo;<br>Some of the nearby spectators also noticed the commotion and began assessing Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo; Cheng Tianchan suddenly burst into laughter. &ldquo;Chu Feng, I didn&rsquo;t think that you would be that shameless. I might have still believed you if you forged an Elite Token, but instead, you chose to forge the Strongest Token. Do you take us for fools?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s forged?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It could be. None of us will be any wiser anyway.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eyy, there sure are many shameless people.&rdquo;<br>Many people thought that Cheng Tianchan&rsquo;s words made sense, especially since it was hard to believe that a nobody had defeated the likes of Ouyang Canjian and Xu Tianjian.<br>The approval of the crowd pleased Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo. They had been wanting to embarrass Chu Feng for a while now, but they hadn&rsquo;t had a chance to do so&hellip; till now. And it was all thanks to Chu Feng. They didn&rsquo;t think that he would be so dumb as to fake the Strongest Token.<br>Just then, a resounding voice echoed from the sky.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be announcing the winners of the Trial of the Strongest.<br>For the early Martial Exalted level category&mdash;Long Xiaoxiao.<br>For the late Martial Exalted level category&mdash;Chu Feng.<br>For the late Half-God level category&mdash;Liu Kuo.&rdquo;<br>The crowd was stunned. They had expected dark horses in the tournament, but they didn&rsquo;t think that the winners would all be foreign names.<br>However, it was a different story for Chu Feng&rsquo;s vicinity. Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo, who were still gleefully prancing around a moment ago, stiffened up from sheer embarrassment.<br>Even if Chu Feng was able to fake the Strongest Token, he couldn&rsquo;t possibly fake an official announcement from the Totem Dragon Clan! In other words, Chu Feng was really the winner of the late Martial Exalted level category!<br>&ldquo;Do you still think my token is forged?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo&rsquo;s twitched uncontrollably. They were so awkward that they couldn&rsquo;t utter a word at all.<br>The others also looked at Chu Feng in surprise. They knew that Chu Feng was strong, but they didn&rsquo;t think that he was that strong. It was a tremendous glory to be titled the strongest one of all late Martial Exalted level cultivators!<br>Meanwhile, Mo Yuhan turned to look at Long Xiaoxiao with surprise in her eyes. She had seen with her own eyes Chu Feng winning the strongest title, but she didn&rsquo;t think that Long Xiaoxiao would win the title too.<br>And Mo Yuhan was hardly the only one who thought that way.<br>&ldquo;Congratulations, Miss Xiaoxiao.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Congratulations, Brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Countless people walked over to offer their congratulations to Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Junior, you actually won the strongest title for the early Martial Exalted level category! You have brought honor to our master. I am proud of you!&rdquo;<br>To alleviate their awkwardness, Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo ran over to Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s side and began fawning on her, but Long Xiaoxiao didn&rsquo;t even spare them a glance.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment. Why didn&rsquo;t they announce the winner of the early Half-God level category?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are they not announcing it because the winner is Long Chengyu?&rdquo;<br>Quite a few people voiced their doubts.<br>Expecting such a reaction, the elder of the Totem Dragon Clan explained the situation, &ldquo;Despite the rumors, none of our Totem Dragon Clansmen have participated in the Trial of the Strongest.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are they not announcing it because Long Chengyu didn&rsquo;t participate?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was still confused.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that we aren&rsquo;t announcing the champion, but that the winner of the early Half-God level category has relinquished her strongest title and her reward,&rdquo; the elder explained.<br>An uproar broke out in the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Relinquished? Why would anyone relinquish such an honor?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Putting aside the Strongest Token, the Dragon Inner Pill is an invaluable treasure! Why would anyone forsake such a precious reward?&rdquo;<br>The crowd couldn&rsquo;t understand why someone would participate in the tournament, only to relinquish their title and rewards after claiming the champion seat.<br>&ldquo;That big sister sure is an interesting person,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao told Chu Feng via voice transmission.<br>The two of them knew that the champion for the early Half-God level category was the cold white-haired woman.<br>Despite the confusion, the curtains were closed on the Trial of the Strongest.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, Miss Xiaoxiao, I know that we haven&rsquo;t known each other for a long time, but it&rsquo;s fate that we&rsquo;re together now. It&rsquo;s our honor to have friends like you. We have specially prepared a celebration banquet to congratulate you on your victory.&rdquo;<br>A bunch of juniors approached Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao to invite them to a celebration banquet.<br>This placed Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo in an awkward position. These juniors were their friends, but they were slighting them in favor of Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao. How could they feel good about that?<br>Long Xiaoxiao was planning to reject the offer, not wanting to get involved with these snobs, but Mo Yuhan suddenly spoke up, &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, why don&rsquo;t we join their banquet since they are warmly welcoming us?&rdquo;<br>That put Long Xiaoxiao in a spot. Her master had told her to get on good terms with Mo Yuhan, but Mo Yuhan was inviting Chu Feng instead of her. This left her displeased.<br>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Chu Feng candidly accepted the offer.<br>Naturally, Long Xiaoxiao wouldn&rsquo;t turn down their offer either.<br>Thus, they headed toward the mountain peak where they had previously gathered. This time, the atmosphere was much better than before, other than the two people loitering around with sour faces.<br>&ldquo;Damn it. Those snobs.&rdquo;<br>Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo harrumphed at the sight of their friends toasting to Chu Feng. In the previous banquet they had, they could still count as one of the main characters, but here, the others were avoiding them like the plague.<br>Their &lsquo;friends&rsquo; had chosen to give them a cold shoulder, knowing about their conflict with Chu Feng. They wouldn&rsquo;t even drink a cup with them.<br>&ldquo;Mo Yuhan?&rdquo;<br>Cheng Tianchan&rsquo;s face suddenly darkened even further.<br>Mo Yuhan had risen from her seat with a cup in her hand to make her way toward Chu Feng.<br>Is she going to propose a toast to Chu Feng too? Why? Just because he won the strongest title?<br><br>&ldquo;Surely not. Mo Yuhan has always kept a cold attitude toward everyone. She can&rsquo;t possibly change her tune all of a sudden,&rdquo; Zhao Yunmo said.<br>&ldquo;Hmph! All women are the same. Her cold attitude is nothing more than an act!&rdquo; Cheng Tianchan spat as he furiously downed cups of wine by himself.<br>Before everyone&rsquo;s eyes, Mo Yuhan walked up to Chu Feng and raised her wine cup.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, you have my deepest gratitude for saving my life,&rdquo; she said before gulping down her wine.<br>&ldquo;I only did what I should,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied before gulping down his wine too.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng saved Mo Yuhan?&rdquo;<br>The crowd immediately understood why Mo Yuhan suddenly had a change of attitude toward Chu Feng.<br>Bam!<br>The door to the palace was suddenly kicked down, and an elder and a young woman walked in. The young woman was Liang Feng&rsquo;s junior, whereas the elder was Liang Feng&rsquo;s master.<br>Everyone was stunned to see Liang Feng&rsquo;s master. It was clear from the vicious look on his face that he was here to exact vengeance for Liang Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to avenge my deceased disciple,&rdquo; Liang Feng&rsquo;s master roared.<br>&ldquo;My grandfather won&rsquo;t spare you if you dare to make a move on Chu Feng!&rdquo; Mo Yuhan immediately stepped in front of Chu Feng to shield him.<br>Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo revealed gleeful smiles. They knew that Liang Feng&rsquo;s master was a reckless man who rarely considered the consequences before acting. He wouldn&rsquo;t easily back down to threats.<br>While they were gloating over Chu Feng&rsquo;s misfortune, Liang Feng&rsquo;s master had already whipped out his saber.<br>Pu!<br>The saber flew across the air and struck Zhao Yunmo, pinning him onto the wall. Fresh blood spurted onto Cheng Tianchan&rsquo;s face.<br>Horrified, Cheng Tianchan exclaimed, &ldquo;Elder Liang, why did you hurt my junior?&rdquo;<br>Shoosh!<br>Liang Feng&rsquo;s master thrust his fist and sent Cheng Tianchan flying across the air. He was still alive, but a gaping hole had been punctured into his chest.<br>Everyone, including Mo Yuhan and Long Xiaoxiao, was stunned.<br>Shouldn&rsquo;t Liang Feng&rsquo;s master seek vengeance on Chu Feng? Why is he going after Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo instead?<br>&ldquo;Why? My disciple died because of you, you despicable little things! You shall pay the price with your lives!&rdquo; Liang Feng&rsquo;s master roared.<br>Killing intent gushed out from him. He was really intending to kill Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo.<br>&ldquo;Enough.&rdquo;<br>A person suddenly stepped in front of Liang Feng&rsquo;s master. At the same time, Liang Feng&rsquo;s master found himself immobilized.<br>The person who had just appeared was Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s master, Ningyu Shangren.<br>Liang Feng&rsquo;s master paled at the sight of Ningyu Shangren, and his body began trembling nonstop. He couldn&rsquo;t afford to offend someone of Ningyu Shangren&rsquo;s standing.<br>On the other hand, Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo&rsquo;s eyes lit up.<br>&ldquo;Master, you must stand up for us!&rdquo; Cheng Tianchan crawled up to Ningyu Shangren&rsquo;s side and sobbed pitifully.<br>Everyone thought that Liang Feng&rsquo;s master was a goner, but to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, Ningyu Shangren turned around and inflicted two tight slaps on Cheng Tianchan&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;You want me to stand up for you?&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren spat with anger.<br>&ldquo;Master, he framed us! We&hellip;&rdquo; Cheng Tianchan tried to explain the situation.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother. Your master and I have been here all along. We saw what you did.&rdquo;<br>Another elder appeared beside Ningyu Shangren. It was Mo Yuhan&rsquo;s grandfather, Mo Chengzhou.<br>Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo were dumbstruck. It was apparent from Ningyu Shangren&rsquo;s reaction that he was telling the truth. Their master had really witnessed their vile deeds with her own eyes.<br>What Ningyu Shangren said next plunged them into despair.<br>&ldquo;I have given you many chances, but you wouldn&rsquo;t cherish them. From this day onward, Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo aren&rsquo;t my disciples anymore!&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren coldly declared.<br></div>
