        <div>: The One Who Hurt Grandmother<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Song Luoyi was none other than Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandmother.<br>However, out of consideration of Song Luoyi&rsquo;s reputation, Lord Yuwei didn&rsquo;t agree to her going through ten months of pregnancy, instead insisting that she would find a way to help her give birth to her son.<br>Ten months of pregnancy was the most primitive method of birth. Not only would Song Luoyi&rsquo;s condition show through her womb, but she would also have to keep herself in tip-top condition and nourish her body well.<br>That wasn&rsquo;t hard for Song Luoyi, but the problem was that she couldn&rsquo;t allow others to learn about it.<br>However, Song Luoyi insisted on going through with it, and Lord Yuwei was unable to convince her otherwise. In the end, Lord Yuwei agreed to help Song Luoyi.<br>They had to hide this matter from the Golden Dragon Flame Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, but there was no way they could remain in the Golden Dragon Flame Sect if they wanted to do that. So, Song Luoyi brought Lord Yuwei out of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect under the pretext of training.<br>With meticulous preparation, Song Luoyi eventually gave birth to Chu Feng&rsquo;s father, Chu Xuanyuan.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that shortly after the young master&rsquo;s birth&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Lord Yuwei&rsquo;s expression suddenly scrunched in pain. Fear could be seen in her eyes. It was apparent that what happened afterward terrified her even after so many years had passed.<br>&ldquo;What happened next?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng knew that this was likely to be the incident that covered his infantilefather with the stench of blood back then.<br>&ldquo;Young miss made a name for herself during that festival, but the overlord of the starfield viewed her as a threat. Thus, they hired a renowned assassination organization in the Totem Galaxy to kill the young miss.<br>&ldquo;Coincidentally, the assassination organization found the young miss shortly after she had given birth to the young master, so she was in a severely weakened state. Fortunately, the young miss still managed to win the battle.<br>&ldquo;However, not too long later, the overlord of the starfield did something even more despicable. They accused the Golden Dragon Flame Sect of a false crime and attacked them. They captured the sectmaster and tortured him in public, hoping to force the young miss to show herself through that.<br>&ldquo;The young miss knew that it was a trap, but she couldn&rsquo;t leave her father in the lurch. So, she had me send the young master back to the Chu Heavenly Clan while she headed to the Golden Dragon Flame Sect.<br>&ldquo;I wanted to look for the young miss after sending the young master to the Chu Heavenly Clan, but who could have thought that I would stumble into the opening of the Darknight Sacred River then? I knew that I wouldn&rsquo;t be of much help to the young miss given my limited cultivation, and I could sense the presence of a fortuitous encounter awaiting me in the river. I thought that this was a godsend opportunity, so I leaped right in.<br>&ldquo;It turned out to be the most foolish decision I have ever made.&rdquo;<br>Lord Yuwei lowered her head in remorse. She had leaped into the Darknight Sacred River out of greed, resulting in her being unable to see her young miss one last time.<br>&ldquo;Elder, my grandmother is likely to be still alive,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;The young miss is still alive? How do you know that, little young master? Did you hear something?&rdquo;<br>A hint of hope surfaced in Lord Yuwei&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;Elder, take a look at this. Is this person my grandmother?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked as he took out a painting.<br>The person depicted in the drawing was none other than the mysterious granny whom Chu Feng had previously met. Her face had been burnt by fire, making it hard for most to recognize who she was. However, Lord Yuwei trembled in excitement upon seeing the painting, and tears started streaming down her eyes.<br>Lord Yuwei kneeled to the floor and cried, &ldquo;Young miss, just what have you been through?&rdquo;<br>Even though the person depicted in the painting was a disfigured old granny, she was still able to tell that she was her young miss, Song Luoyi.<br>Chu Feng felt a stabbing pain in his heart. While he had such a guess all this while, he couldn&rsquo;t help but remember the pitiful state that old granny was in when he met her.<br>To think that she really is my grandmother. My grandmother must have gone through something incredibly cruel, or else she wouldn&rsquo;t have ended up in such a state.<br>&ldquo;Elder, tell me. I want to know the name of the assassin organization who tried to kill my grandmother, as well as the name of the power who destroyed the Golden Dragon Flame Sect,&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He knew that these two powers were the ones who landed his grandmother in her current state.<br>&ldquo;The assassination organization is known as Immortal Slaughterer whereas the power who destroyed the Golden Dragon Flame Sect is known as the Situ World Spiritist Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Situ World Spiritist Clan?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng clenched his fists tightly together upon hearing that name.<br>The name, Immortal Slaughterer, was a foreign one to him, but he had an encounter with those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan before. That group of people had left an awful impression on him back then, but who could have thought that they were the culprits who landed his grandmother in her current state?<br>&ldquo;Lord Yuwei, time&rsquo;s up,&rdquo; a voice sounded outside the palace.<br>Even though Lord Yuwei had sealed off the room so that those outside couldn&rsquo;t hear their conversation, they were still able to hear the voices of those standing outside.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all good as long as the young miss is alive,&rdquo; Lord Yuwei murmured to herself as she wiped off her tears. She turned to Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Little young master, can you give this painting to me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, little young master.&rdquo;<br>Upon receiving permission from Chu Feng, Lord Yuwei started to roll up the painting. It was just an ordinary painting, but she treated it with utmost care.<br>&ldquo;Little young master, you&rsquo;re probably foreign with this place since you have only just arrived here. I&rsquo;ll have Lord Bai explain the details to you. I still have matters to attend to at the moment, so I&rsquo;ll have to ask you to excuse me for a moment,&rdquo; Lord Yuwei said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, go ahead and do whatever you need to,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a minor matter. I&rsquo;ll be right back, little young master,&rdquo; Lord Yuwei said.<br>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.<br>Following that, Lord Yuwei walked out of the palace together with Chu Feng. Tens of millions of people were already gathered outside.<br>&ldquo;Listen up, everyone. This man over here, Chu Feng, is our little young master. He&rsquo;ll be the master of this land from now onward. You&rsquo;ll heed his words no matter what he instructs you,&rdquo; Lord Yuwei said.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was shocked to hear that, especially Lord Bai and the others who had encountered Chu Feng earlier. They couldn&rsquo;t believe how a newcomer had suddenly become the new master of this city.<br>&ldquo;What are you standing in a daze for? Hurry up and pay respects to your new young master!&rdquo; Lord Yuwei urged.<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to the young master!&rdquo;<br>Everyone immediately kneeled down and kowtowed deeply to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Rise, rise. There&rsquo;s no need for you to do this. I&rsquo;m just&hellip; Haaa.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had no plans of becoming the master of this city, but he didn&rsquo;t want to slight Lord Yuwei&rsquo;s authority before so many people. As a result, he didn&rsquo;t know what to do with the situation.<br>&ldquo;Old Bai, you don&rsquo;t need to head there this time. I need you to bring the little young master around. Tell him whatever he wants to know,&rdquo; Lord Yuwei said.<br>&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; Lord Bai replied.<br>Lord Yuwei then turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Little young master, please forgive me. This humble servant will be right back.&rdquo;<br>Not only did she bow deeply to Chu Feng in front of everyone else, but she even addressed herself as a humble servant. It astounded everyone.<br>All of the cultivators present had put Lord Yuwei on a pedestal in their hearts, which made her subservient attitude even harder to accept. To them, it was just like a high and mighty emperor had suddenly kneeled down to a stranger and addressed himself as a humble servant.<br>However, Lord Yuwei wasn&rsquo;t bothered by their reactions at all. This showed just how loyal she was to Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandmother.<br>Following that, Lord Yuwei and all of the cultivators present rose into the sky and headed off into the distance, leaving just Chu Feng and Lord Bai in the area.<br>By this point, Lord Bai was already looking at Chu Feng in a completely new light.<br>&ldquo;Elder, do you believe me now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about whether I believe you or not anymore. You nearly scared me out of my wits! What happened? How did you suddenly become the master of this city?&rdquo;<br>Lord Bai looked at Chu Feng in confusion.<br></p></div>
