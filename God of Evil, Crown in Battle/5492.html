        <h1>Chapter 5492: The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion’s Mansion Master</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Chu Feng, Long Chengyu, and Long Muxi made their way through the Immemorial Star </span><span>Sea. None of them initially experienced any pressure as they were walking down a safe path, but the pressure began to build up as they ventured deeper.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Wu&hellip;&rdquo; Long Muxi&rsquo;s expression became increasingly strained.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Miss Muxi, are you fine?&rsquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can advance any further,&rdquo; Long Muxi said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you go ahead. I&rsquo;ll stay behind to accompany my big sister,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>He could still continue on despite his strained expression, but he decided to stay behind to ensure his big sister&rsquo;s safety.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let me escort you back first,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>As the safe path was constantly changing, Long Chengyu and Long Muxi would be courting death if they tried returning using the same path. It also wouldn&rsquo;t be wise for Long Muxi to stay here for too long given that she was already feeling uncomfortable.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about us, Chu Feng. We can wait here,&rdquo; Long Muxi said. It took them time to get this far; she didn&rsquo;t want Chu Feng to waste his effort.</span><br><span>Chu Feng smiled at Long Muxi before he turned to Long Chengyu to say, &ldquo;Brother Chengyu, let&rsquo;s bring your big sister back.&rdquo;</span><br><span>As he spoke, he had already started making his way back. Long Chengyu smiled in response as he walked over to support his big sister. Long Muxi obediently followed them. She was opposed to returning right now only because she didn&rsquo;t want to trouble Chu Feng, but she appreciated his insistence on bringing her to safety first.</span><br><span>Soon, the three of them were finally out of the Immemorial Star Sea. Long Muxi and Long Chengyu&rsquo;s complexion finally started to improve.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you still to try it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Long Chengyu.</span><br><span>He wasn&rsquo;t sure how far away the endpoint was, but he thought that Long Chengyu could still travel some distance from where they left off.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Nah, I think I had enough. I&rsquo;m also curious to know what&rsquo;s at the end of the road, but it&rsquo;d be better to leave it to you instead. That being said, you shouldn&rsquo;t push yourself too far either,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I know my limits,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied before re-entering the Immemorial Star Sea alone.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big sister, I don&rsquo;t think I want to hang out with Chu Feng anymore,&rdquo; Long Chengyu suddenly said.</span><br><span>Long Muxi looked at Long Chengyu with perplexed eyes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too overpowered. I&rsquo;m going to lose all of my confidence at this rate,&rdquo; Long Chengyu explained with a chuckle.</span><br><span>Those words were clearly a joke, but they also showed how helpless he felt when he thought about the vast gap between him and Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Long Muxi revealed a rare chuckle. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get used to it.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>Chu Feng entered the Immemorial Star Sea via the safe path once more, and he eventually reached the endpoint. There, he saw a stone monument. It was still a distance away, but the stone monument was already well within sight.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are we at a dead end?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>Eggy decided not to ask anymore as she knew that she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to help him.</span><br><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng examined the stone monument, only to find that there was nothing on it. Thus, he tried taking a step forward to move away from the safe path, but he was immediately met with an overwhelming pressure ten times greater than what he was currently experiencing. Even he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to withstand this pressure for a long time.</span><br><span>What alarmed Chu Feng was the power of expulsion lingering outside the safe path. Staying too long outside the safe path would result in him being ejected out of the Immemorial Star Sea. He was planning to examine the stone monument up close, but that was out of the question now.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Weird. There isn&rsquo;t anything on the stone monument at all. Why does the path stop here then?&rdquo; Chu Feng was confused.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is it possible that the clue isn&rsquo;t on the stone monument?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo; Chu Feng thought that those words made sense, so he turned his attention to the surroundings.</span><br><span>Soon, he noticed something.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Did you discover something?&rdquo; Eggy asked when she noticed Chu Feng staring at a single spot.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Something was there, but it disappeared. It looks like I was late,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is it a wasted trip?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Seems so. Oh well. We can&rsquo;t be so lucky as to stumble upon all fortuitous encounters in the world.&rdquo; Chu Feng chuckled to himself as he readied himself to retreat.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, why don&rsquo;t you try using the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>The Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk was a powerful treasure Chu Feng obtained from a remnant, but the treasure possessed its own sentience and often refused to help him. But when it did offer its help, he was almost guaranteed to receive something good in return.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Eggy, I felt uncomfortable there earlier on,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Uncomfortable? Was it the pressure? You should quickly leave this place then,&rdquo; Eggy urged.</span><br><span>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that kind of discomfort. My instincts tell me that I&rsquo;m not the only one here. I feel like I&rsquo;ll be in danger if I take out the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Eggy was surprised to hear that. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s quickly leave this place then.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Instincts were whimsical, but they could be frighteningly accurate at times. It was often better to trust one&rsquo;s instincts than to ignore them.</span><br><span>Shortly after Chu Feng left, the space suddenly warped, revealing a white-robed old man. He had a divine air reminiscent of an immortal descending to the mortal world. His disposition was one that was rarely seen in the world.</span><br><span>He assessed Chu Feng with a contemplative look in his eyes.</span><br><span>Then, he suddenly vanished. It took him only an instant to leave the Immemorial Star Sea when it had taken Chu Feng quite some time to get this far.</span><br><span>Meanwhile, the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Long Xu were waiting for Chu Feng&rsquo;s return, curious to know what he had found.</span><br><span>All of a sudden, the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief lifted his eyebrows. He quickly left the warship for a remote location, and a person appeared out of thin air upon his arrival. The latter had clearly been waiting for him.</span><br><span>It was the white-robed elder who had been observing Chu Feng from the Immemorial Star Sea&rsquo;s stone monument.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Mansion Master,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief greeted the white-robed elder.</span><br><span>He was none other than the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, we&rsquo;ll need to wait a bit longer for the matter I need your help on. I&rsquo;ll inform you when the time comes.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was confused. It made no sense for the other party to request a meeting right now just to ask him to wait. In any case, he figured that he might as well ask right now if he could bring Chu Feng with them to aid them in the task.</span><br><span>Before he could say a word, the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master suddenly asked, &ldquo;Are you familiar with Chu Feng?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Not exactly so. I only know he&rsquo;s a highly talented cultivator from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. He&rsquo;s close friends with my son and daughter,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief replied.</span><br><span>The Seven Realm Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master didn&rsquo;t respond to those words. Instead, he said, &ldquo;Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, I&rsquo;ll send a message to you when it&rsquo;s time to head off.&rdquo;</span><br><span>In other words, he was saying that he wouldn&rsquo;t appear anymore.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Bring Chu Feng together with your juniors,&rdquo; he added before leaving the area.</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief finally understood why the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master had asked to meet him. It turned out it was all for Chu Feng!</span><br><span>&ldquo;Did he see Chu Feng entering the Immemorial Star Sea?&rdquo;</span><br><span>That was the biggest possibility the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief could think of.</span><br><span>Regardless of the reason, it saved him the hassle of convincing the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master. He did want Chu Feng to accompany </span><span>their juniors there, after all.</span></p></div>
