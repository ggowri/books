        <div> - Zhao Kun Defeated<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>After Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s spear slaughtering formation was shattered to pieces, the entire area grew completely quiet.<br>Everyone was stunned. For the moment, they were speechless.<br>None of them had ever imagined that the blue-haired woman would be so powerful.<br>Xia Yun'er had already defeated all three Nine Profound Sect disciples in succession. Yet, before the blue-haired woman, she did not even possess the power to contend against her.<br>After a moment of silence, that blue-haired woman broke the silence.<br>"It's your turn to defend and my turn to attack now," the blue-haired woman said.<br>"There's no need for it anymore," Xia Yun'er shook her head. She said, "I am no match for you. I admit my defeat."<br>After she finished saying those words, Xia Yun'er returned and walked behind Elder Xingyi, beside Chu Feng.<br>Being at such a close distance, Chu Feng was able to see that Xia Yun'er had a very ugly expression. She was acting as if she had received an enormous shock.<br>Her behavior was understandable...<br>No matter how good of a disguise Xia Yun'er was able to put on, she, as the Starfall Holy Land's Holy Daughter, was definitely going to be proud and haughty.<br>Both being Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, there was actually such an enormous disparity between her and her opponent. This would inevitably affect her proud heart.<br>"Miss Xia, it's alright, I am here."<br>Right at that moment, Asura Zhao Kun walked over to Xia Yun'er's side and revealed a confident expression.<br>"I will have to trouble young master Zhao then."<br>Xia Yun'er was originally not fond of Asura Zhao Kun. However, even she had been defeated. Thus, the only person that could retrieve their Starfall Holy Land's lost face would be Asura Zhao Kun.<br>It wasn't that Xia Yun'er looked down on Chu Feng. Had that been the case, she wouldn't have requested his assistance.<br>Merely, from the confrontation earlier, Xia Yun'er was able to tell how powerful that blue-haired woman was.<br>Although that woman was also a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist like herself, they were on completely different levels.<br>Because of that, she felt that since she was no match for that blue-haired woman, Chu Feng would definitely not be able to contend against her either.<br>An existence like her was simply unsurmountable amongst those of same world spiritist level.<br>At that moment, if there was truly someone capable of defeating that blue-haired woman, then it must be Asura Zhao Kun.<br>Thus, while Xia Yun'er was not fond of Asura Zhao Kun, she acknowledged his world spirit techniques.<br>In fact, merely the fact that Asura Zhao Kun's fame had spread throughout the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm served to prove how extraordinary he was.<br>It was not only Xia Yun'er who felt this way; practically everyone from the Starfall Holy Land were feeling this way. Even Elder Xingyi was looking at Asura Zhao Kun with expectation in his eyes.<br>It could be said that Asura Zhao Kun currently carried the hope of everyone from the Starfall Holy Land on his back.<br>Being the object of the Starfall Holy Land's crowd's hopeful gazes, Asura Zhao Kun became even more pleased with himself. He took a disdainful glance at Chu Feng and then patted Chu Feng's shoulder.<br>He said, "Brother, don't worry. With me, Asura Zhao Kun here, there is no need for you to go out and make a disgrace of yourself."<br>Chu Feng did not concern himself with Asura Zhao Kun's mockery, and merely smiled.<br>Chu Feng felt that Asura Zhao Kun was simply a jumping clown. There was no need for him to argue with someone like that.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng smiled instead of becoming angry, Asura Zhao Kun felt very displeased. He took a fierce glare at Chu Feng and then leapt into the air, landing across from that blue-haired woman.<br>Asura Zhao Kun was truly arrogant. Even though that blue-haired woman had revealed her strength, Asura Zhao Kun still didn't place her in his eyes at all. Contempt filled his eyes.<br>"I'll attack and you'll defend. Would that be fine?" Asura Zhao Kun asked.<br>"That's fine."<br>As the blue-haired woman spoke, she waved her sleeve, and a spirit formation covered her.<br>That spirit formation was exactly the same defensive formation that she had used to shatter Xia Yun'er's spear slaughtering formation.<br>"She's actually able to so easily unleash such a powerful spirit formation twice in succession? That's simply too powerful," the two Starfall Holy Land's male disciples were unable to contain themselves.<br>From their sparring match against Xia Yun'er last time, the two of them had realized how powerful that blue-haired woman was.<br>They had originally thought that it would take the blue-haired woman some time to cast such a powerful defensive spirit formation a second time.<br>Yet, to their surprise, that blue-haired woman actually managed to easily unleash that defensive spirit formation again.<br>She had done it so effortlessly. Because of that, it better revealed how powerful her world spirit techniques were.<br>That said, while the others were astonished, Asura Zhao Kun remained completely composed.<br>"Young lady, let me warn you of this."<br>"The person you're facing right now is Asura Zhao Kun. If you continue to underestimate your enemy like this, you will end up suffering a miserable defeat."<br>"Thus, I'm going to ask you this: are you certain that you're planning to use that spirit formation? Are you really not going to strengthen it?" Asura Zhao Kun asked.<br>"There's no need. If you're able to breach this spirit formation of mine, it'll be your win," the blue-haired woman said.<br>"Haha, little lady, you are truly arrogant. Since that's the case, I feel that I, Asura Zhao Kun, must teach you what it means by &lsquo;there are people more talented than oneself in the wider world.&rsquo;"<br>"Woosh~~~"<br>As Asura Zhao Kun spoke, he waved his sleeve and grabbed with his palm. Immediately, brilliant golden light emerged.<br>As the golden light spread, an enormous spirit formation sword appeared in his hand.<br>It was a golden sword over a dozen meters in length. There were three dragons coiling around the sword. Those dragons seemed to actually be alive, and were very eye-catching.<br>"That... could that be the famous slaughtering formation, Three Dragons Heaven-splitting Sword?"<br>Upon seeing that sword, the eyes of the Starfall Holy Land's elders started to shine.<br>"Indeed, that is the Three Dragons Heaven-splitting Sword slaughtering formation," Asura Zhao Kun's grandfather Zhao Kuangfengyi said.<br>Once he said those words, he verified the guesses in the crowd's hearts.<br>At that moment, not to mention the two male disciples from the Starfall Holy Land, even Xia Yun'er's gaze had changed.<br>It was not that they were making a fuss about nothing. Rather, that Three Dragons Heaven-splitting Sword was simply overwhelmingly mighty.<br>Reportedly, the Three Dragons Heaven-splitting Sword was a slaughtering formation that many Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists failed to learn even after spending a great amount of time attempting to learn it.<br>However, Asura Zhao Kun actually unleashed such a powerful slaughtering formation with merely a wave of his hand. This served to verify his strength and reputation.<br>"Don't say that I'm bullying you. Since you've set up your defensive formation with a wave of your hand, I will use this slaughtering formation I've set up with a wave of my hand to defeat it," Asura Zhao Kun said with the Three Dragons Heaven-splitting Sword in hand.<br>"What you've said is but a verbal claim. As for whether or not you'll actually be able to breach my defensive formation, it'll have to depend on your ability," that blue-haired woman said.<br>"Don't be anxious. I will have you know the might of my Three Dragons Heaven-splitting Sword right away."<br>A golden light flashed past. Asura Zhao Kun had sent his Three Dragons Heaven-splitting Sword toward the blue-haired woman.<br>The speed of that Three Dragons Heaven-splitting Sword was extremely fast. It landed on that blue-haired woman&rsquo;s defensive formation in the blink of an eye.<br>However, that Three Dragons Heaven-splitting Sword actually reacted in the same manner as Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s spear slaughtering formation. It did not emit the slightest energy ripple. Just like that, it was fixed onto the defensive formation.<br>At that moment, the two male disciples from the Starfall Holy Land immediately felt their hearts sink. They both thought that Asura Zhao Kun had been defeated.<br>However, Xia Yun&rsquo;er and the older generations present did not feel any worry for Asura Zhao Kun.<br>They all knew that the might of the Three Dragons Heaven-splitting Sword was most definitely not limited to this.<br>Right at that moment, Asura Zhao Kun formed a hand seal with one hand and shouted, &ldquo;Arise!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, dragon roars started being heard. The three dragons on the Three Dragons Heaven-splitting Sword were actually separating themselves from the body of the sword. Upon separation, they turned into enormous hundred-meter-long dragons.<br>These three hundred-meter-long enormous dragons were very vivid and lifelike. They were extremely impressive-looking. The three dragons were winding around the defensive formation and unleashing powerful attacks at it.<br>Not only were energy ripples spreading all over, but all of heaven and earth started to tremble violently.<br>&ldquo;Amazing, as expected of Asura Zhao Kun!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this, the two Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s disciples that were worried that Asura Zhao Kun would lose immediately started beaming with happiness; they were extremely excited.<br>However, the experts like Elder Xingyi and Elder Tuoba started to frown.<br>Those two Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s disciples were unable to tell which of the two spirit formations were stronger.<br>However, they, experts of the older generation like Elder Xingyi, were able to realize the truth with a single glance.<br>At that moment, Asura Zhao Kun&rsquo;s Three Dragons Heaven-splitting Sword had indeed managed to unleash enormous power. However, that blue-haired woman&rsquo;s defensive formation was still completely unmoved.<br>Even Asura Zhao Kun&rsquo;s Three Dragons Heaven-splitting Sword was unable to move that woman&rsquo;s defensive formation.<br>Finally, the mighty attacks from Asura Zhao Kun&rsquo;s Three Dragons Heaven-splitting Sword ended.<br>However, that defensive formation was still completely unscathed before the crowd.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Asura Zhao Kun, Xia Yun&rsquo;er and the two other Starfall Holy Land disciples were all astonished.<br>None of them had expected that woman&rsquo;s defensive formation to be completely undamaged even after withstanding the enormously powerful attack of the Three Dragons Heaven-splitting Sword.<br>At that moment, Asura Zhao Kun&rsquo;s expression immediately changed. The arrogance he had held earlier had disappeared. It had been replaced with panic.<br>He had never imagined that he would be defeated, much less so miserably.<br>Thus, Asura Zhao Kun could be said to have been caught completely unprepared by the current state of affairs.<br><br><br></p></div>
