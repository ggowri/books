        <h1>Chapter 5650: Sense of Defeat</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The palace doors opened to reveal an incomparably large hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the far distance of the hall was a closed spirit formation gate. At the center of the hall was a massive flower field, just that the flower field was empty. On the walls of the hall were intricate and beautiful stone sculptures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was nothing else in the hall other than these.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there another door?&rdquo; Fu Xing murmured with a contemplative frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on the information she had received, there should have been another door </span><span>inside this hall that led to the black ferocious beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng stepped into the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weng!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Chu Feng&rsquo;s foot landed in the hall, a formation whirred into action. A withered tree containing a purple fruit rose from the flower field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fu Xing quickly did the same too, and the formation whirred into action once more. Another tree with a purple fruit rose from the flower field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grar</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two roars echoed simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground overturned as two humongous ferocious beasts boasting a length of over ten thousand meters and a height of three thousand meters rose from the flower field and charged at them. Both of them emanated the aura of a rank six Half-God level cultivator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every step taken by the two humongous beasts shook the ground. Chu Feng and Fu Xing looked as insignificant as a speck of dust before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weng!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a flash of light, and a ten thousand meters long sword and a ten thousand meters long dragon appeared. These were the formations Chu Feng and Fu Xing had constructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sword and the dragon fought with a ferocious beast each, and they eventually </span><span>slayed</span><span> their foe at practically the same time. Clearly, the ferocious beasts were no match for Chu Feng and Fu Xing despite being at rank six Half-God level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two ferocious beasts dissipated as whiffs of auras, whereas the purple fruits they carried floated toward Chu Feng and Fu Xing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like these fruits recognize their owners,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he grabbed one of the purple fruits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Only those who have the power to slay the ferocious beast are qualified to enjoy the benefits of the purple fruit,&rdquo; Fu Xing replied as she took a bite of the fruit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng gobbled up the purple fruit with a couple of bites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The purple fruit was far superior to the other fruits in enhancing one&rsquo;s psyche. At the same time, purple imprints that were clearly superior to the other imprints appeared on their bodies. The effectiveness of a single purple fruit was already far greater than all of the fruits Chu Feng had eaten earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, Chu Feng and Fu Xing could feel their intelligence going up. They quickly closed their eyes and reflected on their own experiences, hoping to see if they could receive anything more from this temporary boost in their intelligence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too short. If only there were more fruits&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng opened his eyes and lamented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo; Fu Xing also opened her eyes and shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While their intelligence had been greatly boosted earlier, the effects only lasted for a brief moment. It wasn&rsquo;t enough for them to grasp anything at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It soon came to their notice that the spirit formation gate at the opposite end of the hall had opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Miss Fu, will we be able to return if we enter that spirit formation gate?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to return anymore. Are you planning to leave now?&rdquo; Fu Xing asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no point staying here. The black fruit probably doesn&rsquo;t exist since there isn&rsquo;t another door here.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It does exist.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Oh? Where?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Give me a moment,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he quickly flitted out of the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he returned with the two thousand people who had accompanied him earlier, including Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span>. He had already explained the situation to them beforehand, so they made sure to travel orderly in rows of two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng.&rdquo; Chu Shanshan and another woman standing at the front looked at Chu Feng nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Shanshan and the woman entered the hall together, but to their surprise, the purple ferocious beast didn&rsquo;t appear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng had told them that a powerful purple ferocious beast would appear when they entered the hall. He would deal with the purple ferocious beast on their behalf, and they would be able to leave the Nine Heavens Secret Domain via the spirit formation gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was different from what they had expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The next two!&rdquo; Chu Feng ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered if the purple ferocious beast didn&rsquo;t appear because the two of them weren&rsquo;t strong enough to trigger the formation. Alternatively, it could be possible that the purple ferocious beast might appear if enough people entered the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another two more people stepped into the hall, but there was still no purple ferocious beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Continue,&rdquo; Chu Feng ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More people entered the hall in an orderly fashion. Only when a hundred people had entered the hall did a purple ferocious beast finally appear. This purple ferocious beast was also at rank six Half-God level, but its physique and fighting prowess were far inferior to the ones Chu Feng and Fu Xing had triggered earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t even have to construct a formation; it only took a casual flick of his spirit power to crush the purple ferocious beast into bits, and its purple fruit floated into his grasp</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then ordered another hundred people to enter the hall, and another purple ferocious beast appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You can take this one,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked at Fu Xing and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that Chu Feng was offering to share the benefits with her, Fu Xing made her move and slew the ferocious beast, thus securing another purple fruit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hold onto it first. It&rsquo;ll be better if you consume all of it at once,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Fu Xing replied with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In groups of a hundred, the others entered the hall as well. In the end, they triggered 23 purple ferocious beasts. Chu Feng had intended to equally share the purple fruits with Fu Xing, but the latter refused to make a move on the three remaining purple ferocious beasts and even walked out of the hall too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Left with no choice, he could only exterminate the purple ferocious beasts by himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Chu Feng obtained thirteen purple fruits, whereas Fu Xing obtained ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Everyone, the fruits are right here. I&rsquo;ll give you a chance to take it yourself lest you think I&rsquo;m lying to you,&rdquo; Chu Feng told the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had told them that only those who had slain the purple ferocious beast could claim the purple fruit. It was not that he didn't want to share the purple fruits with them but that he couldn&rsquo;t do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that, young master Chu Feng. We trust you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, we would have died many times over if not for you. We are thankful to you for escorting us safely here. You deserve to take all the purple fruits.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd refused to even verify Chu Feng&rsquo;s claim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I know that you trust me, but it&rsquo;s best to clarify this matter lest it results in future arguments,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that, young hero Chu Feng.&rdquo; The crowd adamantly refused to even attempt to take the purple fruit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too indecisive. Let me do it,&rdquo; Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out to grab one of the purple fruits floating in front of Chu Feng, but her hand passed right through it. This piqued Chu Shanshan and the others&rsquo; curiosity, as they stepped forward to give it a try too. To their dismay, they couldn&rsquo;t touch the purple fruit at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This proved that only those who had killed the purple ferocious beast could eat the purple fruits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, we&rsquo;ll be taking our leave first.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd made sure to relay their earnest gratitude to Chu Feng before entering the spirit formation gate with beaming smiles on their faces. Not only had they left the dangerous Nine Heavens Secret Domain safe and sound, but they had made considerable gains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they couldn&rsquo;t be ranked at the top, their feat was more than enough to bring honor to their clan and their ancestors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last one to leave was none other than Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> said, having noticed that Chu Feng still had business inside the remnant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> was gone, the only ones left in the hall were Chu Feng and Fu Xing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Miss Fu, consume the fruits together. Don&rsquo;t bother focusing your attention on your psyche when your intelligence rises; focus on the murals around us instead,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he gestured to the stone sculptures around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you think that the way to find the second door lies in the stone sculptures? I have already tried examining them, but there&rsquo;s nothing&hellip;&rdquo; Fu Xing suddenly stiffened up before looking at Chu Feng. &ldquo;Were you examining the murals earlier when you </span><span>consumed the purple fruit earlier? Is that why you&rsquo;re certain that the second door exists?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;No wonder&hellip;&rdquo; Fu Xing looked at Chu Feng with perplexed eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for the latter, she would have thought that the other door didn&rsquo;t exist. While she had known that Chu Feng was not to be underestimated, she still felt defeated. She was relieved to have found a clue to the second door, but she was also dismayed at having been outdone by someone else.</span></p></div>
