        <div> - Various Invitations<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><br>&ldquo;Actually, I, Han Yu, am not someone who will take the initiative to try to get to know someone right after meeting them.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;However, brother Chu Feng, you are qualified for me to do this.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;You have become famous overnight after your battle in the Immortal Armament Villa. You being able to defeat Chu Xianshuo is a trifling matter. What&rsquo;s important is the fact that you were actually able to obtain an Immortal Armament from the Immortal Armament Armory. That is something truly extraordinary.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;And now, you are a truly popular person in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Countless people are discussing you. They&rsquo;re all saying that Chu Feng will become a demon-level genius in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, that you will be able to demonstrate your extraordinary talent in the upcoming Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Even getting on the Demon-level Geniuses List might be possible for you.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;At that time, I, Han Yu, will have my ranking relinquished,&rdquo; Han Yu said to Chu Feng with a smile on his face.<br><br>Although he spoke those words seemingly to praise Chu Feng, those who were smart were able to tell that Han Yu was praising himself.<br><br>After all, he was someone who had left his name on the Demon-level Geniuses List.<br><br>At the same time, Han Yu&rsquo;s words were also calling Chu Feng into question. He did not think that Chu Feng would be able to acquire any ranking on the Demon-level Geniuses List.<br><br>After all, he felt that Chu Feng was only a rank two True Immortal, whereas he, ranked last on the Demon-level Geniuses List, was a rank six True Immortal.<br><br>There was not much time until the upcoming Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition, only a bit over a year.<br><br>To ordinary people, no matter how amazing of a genius someone might be, it would be impossible for them to progress so much as to enter the Demon-level Geniuses List from a rank two True Immortal in a single year.<br><br>&ldquo;Brother Han Yu is being too modest,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled faintly. Then, he looked around and asked, &ldquo;Excuse me, but does anyone know exactly what happened here? Are we able to enter the mountain range or not?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, allow this old man to introduce myself. I am an elder of the Sacred Pellet Villa. My name is Ma Changchun,&rdquo; A white-haired old man stood forth from the crowd.<br><br>That old man had very distinguishing features. While he was not very tall, he was very fat. He gave off a very delightful feeling like that of the Laughing Buddha.<br><br>However, after he approached, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed. The reason for that was because that old man was very strong.<br><br>Actually, for many of the older generation&rsquo;s experts present, if they did not reveal their cultivations by themselves, it would simply be impossible for Chu Feng to see through their cultivations.<br><br>That being said, Chu Feng was able to detect a feeling of unfathomability from people to determine how powerful someone was.<br><br>This old man by the name of Ma Changchun could be said to be the most unfathomable among the crowd present.<br><br>He was also the strongest individual among all the people from the Sacred Pellet Villa present.<br><br>&ldquo;Elder Ma, it is my pleasure to meet you,&rdquo; Chu Feng courteously clasped his fist toward Ma Changchun.<br><br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, all the people that are gathered here are people that have arrived here today.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;After we approached the mountain range, we were all sucked here by the spirit formation. The people from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan only told us that an unforeseen event had occurred in the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain and that we would not be able to enter the mountain range directly for the time being. However, they did not tell us about the specific details.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Thus, we are like you. You now know all that we know. As for what you don&rsquo;t know, we also do not know.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;That being said, while all the people here have arrived here today, there are most definitely people that have arrived before us. After all, every year, whenever Buried Spirit Lake is about to erupt, practically all of the world spiritists beneath Exalted-cloak will want to come here to try out their luck.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Although it is restricted to only people with invitation title plates, there are still a lot of people that will arrive here every year.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Thus, I believe that there should most definitely be a lot of people that arrived here before us. However, they&rsquo;re nowhere to be seen. Perhaps they have already entered the mountain range.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Regardless, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan will most definitely give us an explanation. They will not have us come here for nothing,&rdquo; Elder Ma Changchun said to Chu Feng.<br><br>&ldquo;Thank you, elder, for your explanation,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist again.<br><br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng is being too courteous,&rdquo; Elder Ma Changchun smiled. Then, he actually shifted the topic and turned to ask Chu Feng, &ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, are you really not from the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br><br>At that moment, everyone present, including that Han Yu, all revealed a change in their expressions.<br><br>Likely, this was something that all of them wanted to know.<br><br>&ldquo;Although this Chu Feng is surnamed Chu, I am not a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled and shook his head.<br><br>What he said was not a lie. He was indeed not a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan at present. The reason for that was because he was a discarded child driven out of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br><br>&ldquo;In that case, may I ask which Upper Realm little friend Chu Feng might be from?&rdquo; Ma Changchun continued to ask.<br><br>The gazes of the crowd grew even more intense.<br><br>Likely, they had all assumed that since Chu Feng dared to treat Chu Xianshuo in such a manner, he was likely not someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br><br>Thus, the majority of them felt that Chu Feng should be from another Upper Realm.<br><br>As such, rather than having themselves make wild guesses, it would be better for Chu Feng to tell them directly which Upper Realm he was from.<br><br>&ldquo;This Chu Feng is not from an Upper Realm. Rather, I came from an Ordinary Realm,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>Chu Feng felt that the fact that he was Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son would become known sooner or later. Even though it was still not the time to make that known, it would be fine for Chu Feng to leak some clues.<br><br>At least, he shouldn&rsquo;t lie. Otherwise, it would be difficult for him to explain himself in the future.<br><br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the people present, regardless of whether they were from the younger generation or the older generation, all revealed massive changes in expression.<br><br>This was especially true for the people of the younger generations. They were all wide-eyed and tongue-tied in shock. Their appearances were truly marvelous.<br><br>&ldquo;Ordinary Realm? How could that be?!&rdquo; Someone cried out in alarm.<br><br>After that person cried out in alarm, many others all began to nod their heads. They did not believe that Chu Feng was from an Ordinary Realm.<br><br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, please don&rsquo;t joke around. How could a genius like you be from an Ordinary Realm?&rdquo; Elder Ma Changchun said with a smile on his face. He was truly thinking that Chu Feng was joking.<br><br>&ldquo;This Chu Feng was not joking. After all, Elder Ma asked me so earnestly. Thus, I Chu Feng answered earnestly too. I am indeed from an Ordinary Realm. However, I do not wish to reveal which Ordinary Realm I am from. I hope for your understanding,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;Ssss~~~&rdquo;<br><br>At that moment, Ma Changchun sucked in a mouthful of cold air. Evidently, an enormous wave was raised in his heart. For a moment, he was unable to settle his state of mind.<br><br>It was only after a long time passed that he managed to calm himself. He smiled and said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, in that case, it would mean that you&rsquo;ve just arrived at our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. May I ask if you&rsquo;ve joined a power?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br><br>Hearing those words, Ma Changchun was immediately overjoyed. With a smile on his face, he was about to speak.<br><br>However, Chu Feng already knew what he wanted to say. Thus, before Ma Changchun can say anything, Chu Feng added, &ldquo;However, Chu Feng does not plan to join any power.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;<br><br>Sure enough, after Chu Feng said those words, Ma Changchun reacted as if he had been petrified. He was immediately stunned.<br><br>That being said, as Ma Changchun was an experienced individual, even though he was shocked by Chu Feng&rsquo;s declaration, he immediately understood Chu Feng&rsquo;s intention. Chu Feng was able to tell that he wanted to invite him to join their Sacred Pellet Villa, and did not wish to publicly refuse him. Thus, in order to prevent an embarrassing situation for him, Chu Feng decided to declare his intention beforehand.<br><br>As such, Ma Changchun took out a title plate and handed it to Chu Feng.<br><br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, our Sacred Pellet Villa is very willing to make friends with you. If you have the time in the future, we would love to welcome you as a guest. We will definitely treat you very well. After all, our Lord Villa Master is also someone who wishes to become acquainted with you.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Thank you senior. If I have the time, I will definitely pay a visit.&rdquo;<br><br>Chu Feng accepted the title plate. He knew that the title plate was most likely a protection talisman from the Sacred Pellet Villa. With that title plate in hand, while he would not dare to speak for other powers, he knew for certain that the people from the Sacred Pellet Villa would not dare to do anything to him.<br><br>After Ma Changchun, many people from other powers also stepped forward to chat with Chu Feng.<br><br>There were also people among them that handed Chu Feng title plates like Ma Changchun did. When all was said and done, they merely wanted to befriend Chu Feng.<br><br>One thing worthy of mentioning was that apart from the Sacred Pellet Villa, there was another power by the name of Guardian Formation Villa.<br><br>Reportedly, that Guardian Formation Villa was a power equally as famous as the Sacred Pellet Villa and the Immortal Armament Villa.<br><br>Their world spiritists were very powerful, and they specialized in setting up defensive formations.<br><br>And now, those three powers, those three villas, in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm that most specialized in world spirit techniques had all extended olive branches to Chu Feng.<br><br>&ldquo;Lord Elder, Lord Elder, you must definitely uphold justice for us!&rdquo;<br><br>Suddenly, a thunder-like voice sounded from afar.<br><br>Due to the fact that the voice was simply too loud and clear, the people present all turned their gazes toward the direction of the voice.<br><br>Chu Feng also did the same. He discovered that it was actually three people who were rapidly flying toward the plaza.<br><br>Upon seeing their appearances, Chu Feng revealed a smile on his face.<br><br>The reason for that was because those three people were none other than Li Xiang and his two companions.<br><br><br></p></div>
