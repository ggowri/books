        <div> - Chu Feng's Gravestone<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>With the old ape leading the way, Chu Feng headed deeper into this place. After a short distance, they stopped.<br>At that moment, a gravestone appeared in front of Chu Feng. His expression changed greatly when he saw the name written on it. An indescribable emotion surged into his heart .<br>The name written on the gravestone was &ldquo;Chu Feng&rdquo;. With the Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, he discovered it was made by normal Profound Stone. The marked time was actually the exact same as his current age.<br>But sadly, the only thing he could discover was the things written on the gravestone. When he looked into the grave, he could see nothing.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what is this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the old ape amidst his confusion.<br>&ldquo;Hoh&hellip;&rdquo; The old ape calmly smiled. It was a smile filled with complex emotions. Then, it said, &ldquo;Actually, I really should be calling you &lsquo;Young Master&rsquo;.<br>&ldquo;However, right now, you aren&rsquo;t qualified for that because title respect is gained through strength.<br>&ldquo;As for this grave, it had saved your life before. And right now, it can save your life again.&rdquo; An invisible wave surged out behind the old ape and into the grave.<br>The soil started churning and bursting outward. Very soon, a coffin appeared. It was also made by Profound Stone, but it was enormous. It was more than ten times the size of typical coffins.<br>When he looked at it, the complicated emotions in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart became more and more intense. He truly wanted to know what was inside this coffin and how it was related to him.<br>Before, the old ape said this grave had saved his life, and now, it could save him again. What did that mean?<br>*bang*<br>Just at that moment, a loud muffled sound rang out. The lid of the Profound Stone coffin opened. What appeared within was a blinding light.<br>It was a formation. An extremely profound&mdash;so profound Chu Feng comprehended nothing&mdash;and indescribably powerful formation. Despite its complexity, Chu Feng could still tell it was a Teleportation Formation, one far superior to ones from the Ancient Era.<br>&ldquo;Go. This formation can bring you safely to the Holy Land of Martialism,&rdquo; said the old ape indifferently.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you want me to leave?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in bewilderment.<br>&ldquo;Of course. You aren&rsquo;t thinking of staying here, right?&rdquo; The old ape calmly shot Chu Feng a glance. Its gaze was like saying, &rdquo;You must leave now!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, do you know how I found this place? Do you know how I&rsquo;ve been in all these years? After countless tribulations, I found where you were. After countless tribulations, I came here. I don&rsquo;t have any other goal. I just want to know who my parents are. I just want to know how they are.<br>&ldquo;But&hellip; I don&rsquo;t even understand anything. I don&rsquo;t even know who I&rsquo;m a child to. I don&rsquo;t know even know who my family are. I don&rsquo;t even know why they abandoned me. And now, you want me to leave?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was clearly a bit agitated. In his eyes, there was a trace of desire. He hoped this old ape would tell him a few things because he knew it definitely had information he wanted.<br>&ldquo;Ahh&hellip;&rdquo; Indeed, the old ape was moved after hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. It said, &ldquo;Oh Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m unwilling to tell you, it&rsquo;s just that your father is unwilling to let me tell you. He&rsquo;s here right now, actually. However&hellip; he doesn&rsquo;t want to see you because you're too weak. So weak you&rsquo;re unworthy to be his son.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart couldn&rsquo;t help but tremble. That reason was quite a devastating one.<br>His father, who he dreamt of meeting, who he wholeheartedly admired, wasn&rsquo;t absent. Rather, he was here right now. He was just unwilling to see Chu Feng. And it was because Chu Feng was too weak?<br>&ldquo;Hoh&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly, Chu Feng smiled. It was an abnormally happy smile; but in reality, his heart was filled with extreme anger.<br>Suddenly, he exploded. He roared furiously. Towards the depths of this place, he shouted at the top of his lungs, &ldquo;What kind of bullshit reason is that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You abandoned me from a young age and had me become another person&rsquo;s child. And now, you&rsquo;re still unwilling to recognize me. And this reason is because I&rsquo;m too weak?<br>&ldquo;Fine, I admit. In comparison to you both, I am indeed very weak. I&rsquo;m so pitifully weak. But must family be weighed by strength? How can there be parents like you in this world?! You&mdash;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; But before Chu Feng finished what he wanted to say, the old ape suddenly shouted furiously. That voice was filled with a horrifying aura.<br>When it exploded next to Chu Feng&rsquo;s ear, he felt his head buzz as if his entire being had been blown up. Then, his blurred emotions of sorrow and fury were magically pacified.<br>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t qualified to blame him. Go. Before you have sufficient strength, don&rsquo;t come back here. Of course, if you feel he&rsquo;s an unqualified father, you can also choose to never return. You can go live a life you desire,&rdquo; said the old ape again. However, within its tone, there was a hint of sorrow.<br>Chu Feng, who had already returned to calmness, felt an indescribable pain in his heart when he saw the old ape&rsquo;s expression. He suddenly realized there were some troubles it couldn&rsquo;t speak of. Or, perhaps his father and his family had troubles they couldn&rsquo;t speak of.<br>Regardless how they treated him, when Huangfu Haoyue protected him and when the big dog-head saved him within the Heavenly Road, it was his family behind the scenes. Without them, perhaps he would already be dead.<br>So, it didn&rsquo;t matter how they treated him. The reality was that they protected him with everything they had. There would simply be no explanation why they did that if they didn&rsquo;t love Chu Feng. So, he determined this treatment must be due to some trouble.<br>But what sort of trouble would force someone to abandon their child?<br>&ldquo;Senior, since my father is unwilling to see me, I can leave. However, can you ask him what cultivation I need to have before he&rsquo;s willing to see me? What cultivation do I need until he&rsquo;s willing to recognize me as his son?&rdquo; Chu Feng said coldly. In his eyes, there was even a bit of pleading.<br>The old ape&rsquo;s gaze changed once again, like a layer of frost being melted.<br>&ldquo;Ahh&hellip;&rdquo; It sighed deeply once again, then said, &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, you must have been seen as a genius in the Eastern Sea Region. But do you know why I&rsquo;m saying you&rsquo;re weak?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
