        <div> - Expectation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior, why is Lu Jie&rsquo;s name on that flag?&rdquo; Chu Feng voiced his curiosity.<br>He felt that Grandmaster Tang Chen should know the reason why.<br>Chu Feng noticed that Yuan Shu had a clear change in expression the moment Chu Feng asked that question.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen was also slightly affected by his question.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng realized that the flag could very well have something to do with Lu Jie.<br>&ldquo;That was something that the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted&rsquo;s disciple Lu Jie left behind,&rdquo; answered Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>As Chu Feng had expected, it was the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted&rsquo;s disciple, Lu Jie.<br>&ldquo;Apart from the Compliance Mirror, there&rsquo;s another mystical device in the Ancient Compliance Castle called the Talent Steps.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Talent Steps have a total of three steps. Only those with exceptional talent in world spirit techniques would be able to ascend the Talent Steps.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should one be able to stand on the Talent Steps for an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time, it would mean that one possesses exceptional talent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lu Jie is the only person that has managed to remain standing on the Talent Steps so far.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He stood on the first step and remained there for an entire incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whenever the Ancient Compliance Castle opens, three flags will be raised.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the past, all three flags were blank. No one had thought about the implication of the flags. We'd all thought that they were merely decorative.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, ever since Lu Jie had successfully remained on the Talent Steps&rsquo;s first step, his name had appeared on the first flag.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That was also the day that Lu Jie was deemed to be the most promising world spiritist of the younger generation in the entire Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, he had displayed his incomparable talent,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;It would seem that Lu Jie has some ability.&rdquo;<br>Lu Jie had accomplished what was impossible for others.<br>Chu Feng knew that what Lu Jie had done was an enormously glorious act.<br>Because of that, an idea appeared in his heart.<br>He wanted to leave his name on the Ancient Compliance Castle&rsquo;s flags.<br>Leaving his name would be akin to conquering a treasure of the Ancient Era.<br>To Chu Feng, it would also be an enormously glorious act should he be able to accomplish that.<br>&ldquo;What must I do to enter the Ancient Compliance Castle?&rdquo; Yu Ting asked all of a sudden.<br>Yu Ting was a young woman of few words. Apart from the several times that she would initiate conversations with Chu Feng, she would rarely speak.<br>This was the first time that she had initiated a conversation with someone beside Chu Feng in the past several days.<br>Because of that, even Grandmaster Tang Chen and Yuan Shu were surprised.<br>Their shock only grew greater when they looked at Yu Ting and saw the current expression in her eyes.<br>They did not know Yu Ting well, and had not thought about bothering to know her well either. They only knew that she was Chu Feng&rsquo;s friend.<br>However, at that moment they suddenly realized that the quiet young woman was not that simple of a girl.<br>Her eyes were filled with fighting spirit and ambition.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, could it be that you also want to leave your name on the flags?&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen asked with a smile.<br>He spoke those words in a slightly joking manner.<br>Whilst he was surprised, he did not have much expectation for Yu Ting.<br>&ldquo;I merely want to see how far my talent can reach,&rdquo; said Yu Ting.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, it&rsquo;s very easy to enter. The spirit formation gate is about to open.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, you&rsquo;ll have to pass a test in order to step onto the Talent Steps.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as you can pass the test, you&rsquo;ll be able to enter the Ancient Compliance Castle.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, even if you fail to pass the test, you will not receive any harm from it,&rdquo; said Yuan Shu.<br>After saying those words, he looked at Chu Feng. &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, since there&rsquo;s still some time before the opening of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain, why don&rsquo;t we enter the Ancient Compliance Castle to have a look?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you should go and check it out. It&rsquo;s not that easy to meet Old Man Compliance,&rdquo; added Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>Although they were surprised by Yu Ting&rsquo;s desire to enter the Ancient Compliance Castle, they still placed high hopes on Chu Feng.<br>Both Grandmaster Tang Chen and Yuan Shu wanted to know what sort of commotion Chu Feng would cause should he enter the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>Perhaps he might even leave his name on the second flag.<br>If Chu Feng was able to raise such a commotion at such a gathering, it would be for the best.<br>This would be the best opportunity for Chu Feng to make a name for himself.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, countless spirit formation gates appeared outside the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>They were numerous, and close together. There were simply too many to count.<br>At that moment, the people gathered around the Ancient Compliance Castle began flying towards those spirit formation gates.<br>One thing worthy of mentioning was that the spirit formation gates would change somewhat the moment a single person stepped into it.<br>The spirit formation gates did not disappear. But, they would close. No one else would be able to enter them.<br>In other words, a single spirit formation gate would only allow a single person to enter.<br>Chu Feng felt that there was simply no need for everyone to scramble for the spirit formation gates.<br>The Ancient Compliance Castle was enormous. All around its enormous body were spirit formation gates.<br>The number of spirit formation gates numbered in the tens of thousands. They were more than sufficient for everyone present.<br>&ldquo;Yoh, there are actually some familiar faces.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng noticed some familiar people from the crowd rushing to enter the spirit formation gates.<br>They were Yue Yang and Chen Guang. They were the two genius world spiritists that had been helping Long Xiaoxiao breach the remnant left behind by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, who had ended up being plotted against and forced out of the remnant by the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>Seeing their current vigorous and lively expressions, it appeared that their injuries had completely healed.<br>&ldquo;He actually dared to come here still?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Yuan Shu&rsquo;s gaze turned ice-cold.<br>He also noticed a familiar figure Li Fengxue.<br>Li Fengxue, Yue Yang and Chen Guang were all rushing toward the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>Right after Yuan Shu noticed Li Fengxue, Li Fengxue entered a spirit formation gate.<br>The reason for Yuan Shu&rsquo;s extreme anger upon seeing Li Fengxue was naturally because of what had happened that day.<br>Li Fengxue&rsquo;s master, Revered Master Beast Tamer, had hidden Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects inside the two Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain that he had handed to Chu Feng.<br>If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline being powerful enough to refine the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects, those insects would&rsquo;ve taken Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.<br>The fact that Li Fengxue was there meant that his master must also be here.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect that they came. After all, this old man was planning to find them to settle that debt.&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen said indifferently.<br>Compared to Yuan Shu, Grandmaster Tang Chen reacted very calmly.<br>&ldquo;Master, perhaps I should stay and help you find that Revered Master Beast Tamer,&rdquo; said Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;What use is there in you staying? Go ahead and accompany Chu Feng and that young lady,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Master.&rdquo;<br>Yuan Shu nodded. Then, he looked to Chu Feng.<br>As Chu Feng did not say anything, Yuan Shu didn&rsquo;t know if he was planning to enter.<br>&ldquo;This Ancient Compliance Castle is truly awe-inspiring. I also want to witness the interior of this castle.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he flew towards the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>Seeing that, Yu Ting and Yuan Shu also followed.<br>Soon, the three of them had disappeared into three separate spirit formation gates.<br>After seeing them disappear into the spirit formation gates, Grandmaster Tang Chen looked around. A smile of expectation had appeared on his face.<br>After seeing the world spiritists present, the smile on his face grew even more concentrated.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, let us quietly wait. You will all soon be astonished.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You all will soon realize who is the most talented world spiritist in the Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After today, you will all remember that name.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And one day, you will learn whose disciple he is,&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen said quietly. The tone of his voice was one filled with expectation.<br>Although no one heard his words, he knew that what he'd said would definitely come true.<br>He was waiting to see the looks of astonishment on those people&rsquo;s faces.<br></p></div>
