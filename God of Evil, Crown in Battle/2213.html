        <div> - Confidence<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Silence. Chu Feng&rsquo;s words struck Liu Chengkun like a lightning strike. It jolted Liu Chengkun completely awake.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, say what you just said again,&rdquo; Liu Chengkun asked.<br>&ldquo;I have been poisoned by your servant girl,&rdquo; Chu Feng said calmly.<br>&ldquo;Poisoned? What sort of poison?&rdquo; Liu Chengkun asked worriedly. He could tell that Chu Feng was not joking. However, something like poisoning was no small matter. As such, how could he not be nervous?<br>&ldquo;A poison that will restrict one&rsquo;s world spirit power. The poison has entered my body and fused with my soul. Even if I am to destroy my physical body, I will still not be able to break free from the poison.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fortunately, the poison will not activate yet. It will only activate when I start to activate my world spirit power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, even should it activate, it will also not cause fatal danger to my life. All it will do is restrict my world spirit power. In other words, when the poison is activated, I will only be able to use a tenth of my world spirit power,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! Who would poison you with this sort of poison? Zhao Ruofan! It must have been Zhao Ruofan!&rdquo; Liu Chengkun said while gnashing his teeth.<br>&ldquo;It was indeed him. There was an uninvited guest at the feast today. Although he concealed himself extremely well, I was still able to recognize him. He was Zhao Ruofan&rsquo;s son, Zhao Xiao&rsquo;s father, Zhao Xuan,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;It was Zhao Xuan?&rdquo; Liu Chengkun asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He snuck in and was focused on me the entire time. It was only after I took the poison that he left at ease,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;So it was Zhao Ruofan. For the sake of tomorrow&rsquo;s match, he actually used such despicable methods. I will definitely make him pay,&rdquo; After knowing what had happened, Liu Chengkun was filled with anger. He turned around and prepared to leave.<br>&ldquo;Senior Liu, please wait,&rdquo; Seeing that Liu Chengkun was planning to go and settle this with Zhao Ruofan,. Chu Feng hurriedly spoke to stop him, &ldquo;There is one thing that I must tell you still.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what is it?&rdquo; Liu Chengkun asked.<br>&ldquo;I had already noticed that there was poison in the wine before I even drank it. Thus, I drank the poisoned wine on purpose,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;On purpose?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, why did you take the poison on purpose?!&rdquo; Liu Chengkun had an expression of shock. He did not understand what Chu Feng was thinking.<br>&ldquo;I took the poison precisely so that I could make Zhao Ruofan feel that he had prevailed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the reason why I dared to take the poison, it is because I possess a body immune to poisons. At the very least, that poison is incapable of causing me harm,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, you actually possess a body immune to poison?&rdquo; Liu Chengkun was even more shocked upon finding out about that.<br>&ldquo;Senior Liu, tell me, do you wish to eliminate that Zhao Ruofan?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I do. I have found him to be repulsive the entire time. But, Xiaoli, she&hellip;&rdquo; Liu Chengkun was placed in a difficult situation. He seemed to have hidden troubles.<br>Even without Liu Chengkun explaining things to him, Chu Feng was able to guess that the &lsquo;Xiaoli&rsquo; that he spoke of must be the Red Butterfly Society&rsquo;s President.<br>However, that was not what was important. What was important was the fact that they currently possessed the opportunity to eliminate Zhao Ruofan. Thus, without the slightest hesitation, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;This is a great opportunity to eliminate Zhao Ruofan. At the very least, we will be able to deprive him of the authority and status he holds in the Red Butterfly Society.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, Senior Liu, you only need to capture that servant girl that had poisoned me. Then, do not alert the enemy for now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It will be fine should we have her tell us what happened. Tomorrow&hellip; we will completely expose Zhao Ruofan&rsquo;s wicked conduct,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Tomorrow? Why are we not exposing him right now? If we are able to expose Zhao Ruofan&rsquo;s wicked conduct now, there will be no need for a match tomorrow,&rdquo; Liu Chengkun said.<br>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going to compete. I must let Zhao Ruofan and everyone else know that I, Chu Feng, possess sufficient qualifications to enter Mount Cloud Crane.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will let them know that I would be able to defeat Zhao Ruofan and obtain the qualifications to train in Mount Cloud Crane even if this didn&rsquo;t happen,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Okay then, let&rsquo;s do as little friend Chu Feng suggests,&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng was determined, Liu Chengkun did not try to urge him against it anymore.<br>Then, he left to find that servant girl. Originally, that servant girl was planning to escape. However, never did she expect that her actions would&rsquo;ve been exposed so quickly. Thus, before she could escape, she was captured by Liu Chengkun.<br>At the beginning, the servant girl was unwilling to admit that she had poisoned Chu Feng. However, after Chu Feng began to narrate the process of how she had poisoned him in clear detail, she was immediately terrified.<br>She had truly never expected Chu Feng to know all of the details of how she had poisoned him. Thus, without even being tortured, the servant girl admitted to it.<br>As for the mastermind behind her, it was naturally Zhao Ruofan.<br>In fact, she had already been bribed by Zhao Ruofan many years ago. She had stayed by Liu Chengkun&rsquo;s side precisely so that she could assist Zhao Ruofan in dealing with him.<br>&ldquo;I have trusted you in vain. Not only did you betray me, you even poisoned my honored guest,&rdquo; At that moment, Liu Chengkun was furious. He was fuming with rage between gritted teeth.<br>He would not mind if that servant girl were to do anything to him. Yet, this servant girl had actually dared to poison Chu Feng; that was something that he could not tolerate.<br>&ldquo;Lord Elder, I am sorry. It is all this servant&rsquo;s fault. Over the years, you have treated me extremely well. If Vice President Zhao ordered me to do harm to you, I would not have been able to do it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is why I only agreed to provide information to him, that I would never do anything that would harm you. This time, I poisoned Lord Chu Feng all because of my obsession with riches.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, it remains that I have attended to you for all these years. Even if I have never provided any meritorious service, I have still worked hard. I do not have any other requests. I only hope that Lord Elder will give me a quick death,&rdquo; The servant girl knew that she would be killed. Thus, she did not beg for forgiveness, and only begged for a quick death without being tortured.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to die. In fact, you can live very pleasantly,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re not going to kill me?&rdquo; The servant girl was shocked to hear those words.<br>&ldquo;As long as you expose Zhao Ruofan before Lady Society President tomorrow, and expose how he had you stay at Elder Liu&rsquo;s side, as well as all of the things he had you do, I can guarantee you that you will not be killed,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Elder, is that true?&rdquo; The servant girl acted as if she did not believe what Chu Feng had said. Thus, she looked to Liu Chengkun.<br>&ldquo;How could little friend Chu Feng lie to you?&rdquo; Liu Chengkun snorted and said with a cold and disappointed tone.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, thank you for sparing my life. I will definitely follow your orders. You can tell me to do anything. I will definitely expose Zhao Ruofan and tell all of his evil conducts,&rdquo; The servant girl hurriedly kowtowed to Chu Feng. She was feeling so grateful toward Chu Feng that she was weeping bitter tears.<br>As for Chu Feng, he smiled lightly. Then, he said, &ldquo;I do not need you to add details to your story when you&rsquo;re exposing Zhao Ruofan. It will do if you just tell the truth.&rdquo;<br>&hellip;...<br>Next day. It was the same palace hall. The people from yesterday were all gathered here.<br>In fact, many among them revealed very excited expressions. After all, they would be able to witness a match between world spiritists.<br>To them, such a match was not something extremely rare. However, it remained that a match between two Royal-cloak World Spiritists was quite rare.<br>As for Zhao Ruofan, he had an extremely arrogant expression from the moment he appeared. After seeing Chu Feng, he even declared, &ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, do you need me to start off leniently so that you do not lose too miserably?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d suggest that you go all-out,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled lightly. He added, &ldquo;because no matter what, you will end up suffering a crushing defeat.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh my, you&rsquo;re about to frighten me to death here. Hahahaha&hellip;&rdquo; Zhao Ruofan laughed frantically. He had lost himself in joy. Hearing and seeing his laughter, the expression of the Red Butterfly Society&rsquo;s President turned ugly.<br>However, Zhao Ruofan acted as if he did not see her. He continued to mock Chu Feng, &ldquo;Young man, I&rsquo;d suggest that you not boast. If you take too large of a stride when you walk, you might end up tripping.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You will soon know whether or not I am boasting,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled confidently.<br>His confidence moved even the people present. They began to feel that Chu Feng seemed to truly possess certainty in being able to fight against Zhao Ruofan.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo; Zhao Ruofan did not reply. Instead, he laughed. In his heart, he was thinking, &lsquo;Brat, continue to act proudly. Soon, when you activate your world spirit power, that poison will end up activating. At that time, I shall see whether or not you can continue to smile.&rsquo;<br>Zhao Ruofan felt that Chu Feng was merely putting up false bravado. Regardless of whether or not Chu Feng possessed true abilities, he was certain that it would be his victory today.<br><br></p></div>
