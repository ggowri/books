        <div> - Seeking Survival By Breaking Through The Formation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>The Snow-haired Immortal used her sharp gaze to look at Chu Feng. It was as if she could see through Chu Feng completely.<br>This woman was too frightening. Before her, Chu Feng did not dare to hesitate. Thus, he immediately said, &ldquo;Junior is indeed an Asura World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s baseless to just declare something. Show me proof,&rdquo; As the Snow-haired Immortal spoke, she took out a compass.<br>This compass was very ancient. Furthermore, it was very special. There was no pointer in the center of the compass. Instead, there were seven symbols all around the compass.<br>It was Chu Feng&rsquo;s first time seeing these symbols. However, he was able to guess that these seven symbols should signify the Fairy, Buddha, Ghost, Demon, Beast, Elf and Asura, the Seven Spirit Worlds.<br>Chu Feng realized the intention of the White-haired Immortal. Chu Feng had declared that he was an Asura World Spiritist, but he possessed no proof. Thus, she wanted him to prove himself. As for this compass, it was capable of determining whether or not Chu Feng was an Asura World Spiritist.<br>Not only did Chu Feng know about the use of this compass, Chu Feng also knew how to use it. After all, Chu Feng was not a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist in name only.<br>Thus, Chu Feng received the compass and instilled a strand of his spirit power into it. After his spirit power entered the compass, the seven patterns on the compass actually began to shine.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s strand of spirit power entered the location where the pointer should be. However, his strand of spirit power did not turn into a pointer. Instead, like a little snake that was swimming in the water, it began to swim around in circle.<br>Wherever the strand of spirit power reached, the Fairy, Buddha, Ghost, Demon, Beast and Elf, the six of them all stopped shining.<br>However, when the strand of spirit power reached the Asura symbol, the light started to rapidly increase. Then, that strand of spirit power turned into a strand of light and entered the Asura symbol.<br>At this time, the light from the Asura symbol began to decline, and stopped being as dazzling as before. However, it did not die out. Instead, it continued to shine. Compared to the other six symbols, it was much more dazzling.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected that you were really an Asura World Spiritist. Truly, anything can happen in this era.&rdquo;<br>The Snow-haired Immortal took the compass back from Chu Feng. However, she was still as expressionless as ever. It seemed that Chu Feng actually being an Asura World had caused her emotions to waver slightly.<br>However, Chu Feng had been paying attention to the Snow-haired Immortal the entire time. He had discovered that when the light emitted by the Asura symbol started to shine brightly, that Snow-haired Immortal&rsquo;s pupils had shrunk slightly. This meant that she was still shocked by this, and was merely acting very calm.<br>&ldquo;Boy, you&rsquo;ve lost my scroll. However, taking into consideration that you&rsquo;re an Asura World Spiritist, I&rsquo;ll give you a chance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set up a spirit formation. If you are able to break through it, I&rsquo;ll spare your life,&rdquo; After the Snow-haired Immortal finished saying those words, without even waiting for Chu Feng to respond, she began to set up a spirit formation.<br>As expected from a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. When setting up that spirit formation, she was extremely proficient. Even Chu Feng felt inferior, and began to admire her techniques.<br>However, when the Snow-haired Immortal finished setting up the spirit formation, Chu Feng started to frown. Gradually, an uneasy feeling began to rise in his heart.<br>This spirit formation was too frightening. Just by looking at it, one&rsquo;s hair would stand on end, and one&rsquo;s back would start to chill.<br>That spirit formation was filled with bugs. There were all sorts of bugs. However, one thing was certain, all of those bugs possessed extremely powerful offensive abilities.<br>&ldquo;When you enter that spirit formation, those bugs will enter your body and begin to devour your internal organs, your meridians, your bones and the rest of your body.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If they finish devouring your internal organs, your meridians and your bones, they will begin to attack your dantian.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for what you must do, it&rsquo;ll be to enter that spirit formation and stand there without using spirit formations to defend or counterattack. Furthermore, you are not allowed to resist the attacks from the bugs,&rdquo; said the Snow-haired Immortal.<br>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you simply telling me to die?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Feng cursed out.<br>How could this woman possibly be an Immortal? She was simply a malicious witch. What did she mean by &lsquo;a chance&rsquo;? In the end, she wanted him to be devoured alive by bugs. This was simply too ruthless.<br>&ldquo;If you wish to die, I can grant you that wish right now. However, if you do not wish to die, then do as I say,&rdquo; The Snow-haired Immortal&rsquo;s eyes shone, and a boundless killing intent penetrated Chu Feng&rsquo;s chest.<br>At this moment, even though his body was completely unharmed, Chu Feng shivered violently. Then, he moved back several steps and nearly fell to the ground.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s entire body was filled with cold sweat. He did not dare to talk back to the Snow-haired Immortal anymore. The reason for that was because, after the gaze from her earlier, Chu Feng firmly believed that if this Snow-haired Immortal wanted to torment him, he would definitely feel so much pain that he would wish to die.<br>&ldquo;When those bugs begin to devour your body, they will die quickly afterwards. Furthermore, the number of bugs in that spirit formation is limited.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While you cannot attack, cannot defend, and cannot oppose them, you can use spirit techniques to restore your internal organs, your bones and your meridians,&rdquo; The Snow-haired Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;Very well, bring it on,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded, then stepped into the center of that spirit formation.<br>Chu Feng had understood the intentions of the Snow-haired Immortal. No matter how numerous the bugs might be, they would certainly run out. She wanted Chu Feng to preserve his life through the use of his internal organs. When all of the bugs disappeared, it would be equivalent to Chu Feng breaking through that spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Seems like you&rsquo;re very intelligent, and have managed to understand my intentions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I must still warn you of this. These bugs&rsquo; attack speed is not slow. You must quickly repair your body. Else, when your internal organs, your meridians and your bones have all been devoured, they will start to attack your dantian.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I believe you should know very well what the consequences of having your dantian damaged would be,&rdquo; The Snow-haired Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;I only wish to ask, other than world spirit techniques, am I able to use other techniques to restore my body?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You are. All techniques are allowed,&rdquo; The Snow-haired Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;Bring them on then,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Ji, ji, ji, ji~~~&rdquo;<br>The Snow-haired Immortal&rsquo;s eyes shone. Then, like an army that was just handed orders, those densely packed bugs all began to move. With lightning speed, they landed on Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, drilled into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body and began to tear away at Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>At this moment, even Chu Feng started to frown. He was in so much pain that his complexion turned pale, his lips turned purple, and he began to sweat profusely.<br>The reason for that was because those bugs were not ordinary bugs. When they were devouring Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, the pain that they brought along was extremely difficult to endure.<br>However, Chu Feng had no other choice. Not only must he endure this pain, he must endure them devouring his internal organs and the rest of his body continuously.<br>The only thing Chu Feng could do was clench his teeth tightly and use his spirit techniques and the Vermillion Bird Revival Technique to restore the parts of his body that had been devoured by the bugs to ensure that the bugs would not attack his dantian.<br>The reason for that was because as soon as the bugs started to attack his dantian, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation would start to decline. This was something that Chu Feng could not allow to happen at any cost.<br>This was a crisis. If he successfully passed through it, he would be able to live. If he failed to pass through it, he would surely die.<br>As for Chu Feng, he must pass through it.<br>Because, he must not die.<br></p></div>
