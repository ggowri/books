        <div> - This Separation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>When Chu Feng woke up, he discovered that Su Rou and Zi Ling had already gotten out of bed. The two of them had finished dressing. Not only that, they had even personally used world spirit formation techniques to prepare a very luxurious banquet for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Delicious!&rdquo; Even though all of the utensils other than the food were made out of spirit formations, Chu Feng deeply enjoyed the food. Furthermore, he found it to be delicious from the bottom of his heart. After all, this was food that his loved ones had prepared for him. Contained within the food was the taste of love.<br>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s good, then eat some more,&rdquo; Zi Ling and Su Rou did not eat alongside Chu Feng. They had their hands underneath their chins and were looking at Chu Feng with beaming smiles as he ate the food.<br>&ldquo;You two, why aren&rsquo;t you eating?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not hungry. You should eat some more. Make sure to eat it all,&rdquo; Su Rou and Zi Ling said together.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I will definitely eat all of it. But, you two must accompany me. Come, open your mouths,&rdquo; Chu Feng picked up some food with his chopsticks and placed it near Zi Ling&rsquo;s mouth.<br>Faced with Chu Feng&rsquo;s action, Zi Ling seemed to be unable to resist. Involuntarily, she opened her little mouth and allowed the food to enter her mouth. Happily, she began to chew on the food.<br>&ldquo;Come, my Rou&rsquo;er,&rdquo; Then, Chu Feng picked up some more food with his chopsticks and brought it toward Su Rou&rsquo;s mouth. He was truly impartial to the two ladies.<br>&ldquo;Unscrupulous,&rdquo; Su Rou cast a side eye at Chu Feng while smiling. However, like Zi Ling, she opened her little mouth and ate the food Chu Feng had picked up for her.<br>Then, Chu Feng, Su Rou and Zi Ling began to eat the food one small mouthful at a time. In the end, they actually managed to eat all the food on the table.<br>Even though this place was not their home, the atmosphere of warmth had filled the house. With this sort of atmosphere present, this place was their home right now.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng, Su Rou and Zi Ling all felt the same thing. They all did not wish to part. They wished to be able to be with each other every day.<br>Even if they did not do any world-shaking things and only spent the rest of their lives peacefully like this, it would be sufficient.<br>Unfortunately, they were unable to choose that path&hellip; especially Chu Feng, he was even more incapable of choosing that path. There were too many things that he had to do.<br>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; Suddenly, Zi Ling and Su Rou&rsquo;s gazes turned cautious. Even though the Weaponry Refinement Immortal had allowed the two of them to accompany Chu Feng, he did not wish for others to know about the relationship they had with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, it&rsquo;s a senior from the Immortal Island. You two wait for me in the house,&rdquo; Chu Feng walked out. Sure enough, the Immortal Island&rsquo;s old man that had received him before soon walked over.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, the Weaponry Bestowment Assembly has ended. Even though this old man does not want to say these words to you, I must still inform you that it is time to part,&rdquo; that old man said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng understands. I&rsquo;ll arrange my stuff and leave immediately after,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Suddenly, that old man said, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right, the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts&rsquo; princess wishes to see you before you leave the Immortal Island. She has been insisting on this for many days now, and has said that she will not leave if she doesn&rsquo;t get to see you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The King Monstrous Dragon Beasts&rsquo; princess? She wants to see me?&rdquo; Chu Feng was surprised to hear those words. He naturally knew who the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts&rsquo; princess was. She was most definitely the person with the greatest strength and talent among the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts present.<br>She must be that person with a cultivation on par with Nangong Ya, Beitang Zimo and the current Tantai Xue, that rank three Half Martial Emperor.<br>While taking the test to determine one&rsquo;s talent in the Cultivation Immortal Lake, she was that extraordinary woman who triggered the same amount of rings of light as Beitang Zimo and Nangong Ya.<br>However, these were not the reasons why Chu Feng had an impression of her. Rather, it was because when Beitang Zimo had been making things difficult for Chu Feng that day, that princess had also led her group of King Monstrous Dragon Beasts and helped Chu Feng attack Beitang Zimo.<br>However, it was after Chu Feng had revealed his talent that she spoke on his behalf. In other words, she had only decided to help Chu Feng, only decided to try to befriend Chu Feng, after finding out that he possessed exceptional talent.<br>&ldquo;Our Immortal Island has a rule that states that we cannot expose the whereabouts of a guest to another guest. However, even with that being the case, she still insisted on wanting to see you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After careful consideration, we decided to mention this matter to you. However, in the end, you are the one who gets to decide whether you will see her or not. If you wish to see her, I will go and bring her over. If you do not wish to see her, you can pretend that I never mentioned this matter to you,&rdquo; the old man continued.<br>&ldquo;Even though I do not know why she wants to find me, the fact that we came to this place together only means it was fated. Since she wishes to see me, then senior, please bring me to her. I&rsquo;ll go and see her,&rdquo; Chu Feng felt that it would be better to have another friend than to have another enemy. Furthermore, the opposing party was the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts&rsquo; princess.<br>Since the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts&rsquo; princess insisted on seeing him, it would be unsuitable for him to refuse her too.<br>&ldquo;If you wish to see her, then I&rsquo;ll go and bring her over. There is no need for you to come with me. Just wait here,&rdquo; As the old man spoke, he left.<br>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; sis Zi Ling, quickly, look. Our Chu Feng is as charming as ever. Regardless of where he goes, he will obtain a favorable impression of girls regardless of their status and position. Never would I expect that even a King Monstrous Dragon Beast would be interested in him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, my big brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s charm is getting more and more enormous.&rdquo; Su Rou and Zi Ling walked out from the house. Even though the two of them were teasing Chu Feng and making fun of him, there was a faint trace of jealousy in their tones.<br>&ldquo;My darlings, please don&rsquo;t say it like this. I am not interested in monstrous beasts,&rdquo; Chu Feng had a bitter smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;Who knows if you are interested or not? It is unsuitable for lil&rsquo; sis Zi Ling and I to see you off. We&rsquo;ll leave first,&rdquo; As Su Rou spoke, she pulled Zi Ling and prepared to leave.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Why leave so quickly?&rdquo; Chu Feng was reluctant to part.<br>&ldquo;What do we do if we don&rsquo;t? Even if we don&rsquo;t leave, you&rsquo;re going to be leaving the Immortal Island very soon.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts&rsquo; princess will be coming soon. She has waited this many days in order to see you. After finally being able to see you, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly meet her outside of the house, right?&rdquo; Su Rou said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng could say nothing. That was because what Su Rou said made a lot of sense. Even though he was extremely reluctant, he still had to part with Su Rou and Zi Ling here<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you must be careful when you&rsquo;re traveling the Holy Land of Martialism by yourself. Wait for us. When big sis Rou and I finish our cultivation, we will come and find you,&rdquo; On the verge of separation, Zi Ling was feeling very reluctant to part too.<br>&ldquo;You two do not have to worry about me. Take proper care of yourselves. Make sure to not make things difficult for yourselves for my sake again,&rdquo; Chu Feng was afraid that Su Rou and Zi Ling would harm their own bodies again in order to attain a higher cultivation.<br>&ldquo;If you want the two of us to not be worried about you, then take care of yourself properly. Stop trying to be the hero. There are a lot of people in this place who you can&rsquo;t afford to provoke,&rdquo; Su Rou had a sharp tongue but a soft heart. In the end, she spoke her gentle feelings.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I will follow the commands of my two great wives.&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he clasped his fist toward Su Rou and Zi Ling in an extremely respectful appearance.<br>&ldquo;Oh you&hellip;&rdquo; Facing with Chu Feng acting like this, Su Rou and Zi Ling, whose eyes were already red, started to smile.<br>In the end, Zi Ling and Su Rou left. As they were leaving, they repeatedly turned around. The two strong girls&rsquo; eyes had turned red once again, and tears began to roll down from them.<br>This Zi Ling and Su Rou were unlike the ones in Chu Feng&rsquo;s impression. However, this signified how deep their feelings for Chu Feng were.<br>With women like them loving him, Chu Feng felt extremely blessed...<br>However, Chu Feng was not overly sad. That was because he knew that they would meet again after this parting.<br></p></div>
