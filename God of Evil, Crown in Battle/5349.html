        <div><span>: Four New Lackeys?</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>It only took a mere moment for Daoist Sixth Dragon to deal with young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father and the others.</span><br><span>Daoist Ninth Dragon cast a sweeping glance and asked, &ldquo;Someone mentioned that young friend Chu Feng is a nobody. Who was it? If I didn&rsquo;t remember wrongly, it was you, right?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Zhou Shuang&rsquo;s face paled in despair. The person Daoist Ninth Dragon was looking at was none other than her. Before she could beg for mercy, a powerful force dragged her out of the crowd and across the gorge, till she was kneeling right in front of Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You wench! Who do you think you are to insult young friend Chu Feng? Who gave you the guts to do so?&rdquo; Daoist Ninth Dragon coldly questioned. He was the one who dragged Zhou Shuang from the crowd.</span><br><span>Zhou Shuang shuddered in fright, not daring to utter a word at all.</span><br><span>Putong!</span><br><span>The Zhou Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief fell to his knees and sorrowfully cried out, &ldquo;Milord, my foolish daughter might be tactless, but she has no ill intention. Please spare her life!&rdquo;</span><br><span>But Daoist Ninth Dragon wasn&rsquo;t moved in the least.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t utter a single word when young friend Chu Feng was being bullied by those small fries, but here you are, pleading with me right now. Are you implying that I am less than those small fries? Or do you think that we&rsquo;ll kindly overlook your earlier transgressions toward young friend Chu Feng just because you&rsquo;re on your knees?&rdquo; Daoist Ninth Dragon asked coldly.</span><br><span>The Zhou Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was rendered speechless by those words.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Well said! Those words raised my opinion of that old man!&rdquo; Eggy exclaimed in exhilaration.</span><br><span>She wouldn&rsquo;t have spared the slightest consideration for the Zhou Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief either. Those people weren&rsquo;t worthy of that. Chu Feng knew that too, which was why he didn&rsquo;t plan to speak up for the Zhou Clan.</span><br><span>Knowing that things had gone awry, Zhou Yi also kneeled on the ground. She wisely chose to plead with Chu Feng instead of the four daoists.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, I know that our Zhou Clan has done you an injustice, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; Daoist Ninth Dragon cut her words short with a furious roar.</span><br><span>Daoist Eighth Dragon joined in as well, &ldquo;Do you think that you&rsquo;re in a position to plead for others?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Maybe those bunch of fools hasn&rsquo;t realized that they are all going to die here today,&rdquo; Daoist Seventh Dragon sneered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Zhou Clan&rsquo;s clansmen were horrified to hear those words. They had chosen to quietly spectate from the side because they thought that this matter had nothing to do with them&mdash;Zhou Shuang was the only one who had mocked Chu Feng&mdash;but who could have thought that they would be implicated in this as well?</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, we have nothing to do with this!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Those from the Zhou Clan attempted to draw a line between them and Zhou Shuang in hopes of being spared.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You have nothing to do with this?&rdquo; Daoist Sixth Dragon&rsquo;s face turned cold. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you step out when that wench insulted young friend Chu Feng earlier? How dare you brazenly claim innocence here when you were the ones who implicitly permitted her audacity? Do we look like fools to you? Or does young friend Chu Feng look like someone you can simply trample over?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Overwhelming pressure crushed everyone on the opposite side to the ground. It was directed not just at the Zhou Clan but at everyone else too.</span><br><span>Countless voices were transmitted to Chu Feng right after. There was a mix of unfamiliar voices as well as familiar ones, such as Zhou Yi, the Zhou Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, and the elder who first recognized Chu Feng. They were begging him to spare them.</span><br><span>But Chu Feng chose to ignore them. He thought that they ought to be punished for being ingrates, although he didn&rsquo;t think that they deserved death.</span><br><span>Putong!</span><br><span>Another person suddenly kneeled on the ground. It was Zhou Zhi.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, please spare my clansmen!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Zhou Zhi didn&rsquo;t even bow down to young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father, but here he was, begging Chu Feng for his clansmen.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Zhou Zhi, are you pleading for just your clansmen or everyone on the other side?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s human nature to be afraid of death. Please let them off!&rdquo; Zhou Zhi kept his head lowered even as he spoke, almost as if he didn&rsquo;t think that it was right for him to be begging Chu Feng to spare the others.</span><br><span>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t answer his question. Instead, he pulled Zhou Zhi back to his feet before turning to the crowd. &ldquo;Remember this. You&rsquo;re only alive right now because of Zhou Zhi.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The terrifying pressure disappeared as soon as those words were spoken.</span><br><span>Daoist Sixth Dragon had retracted his spirit power upon realizing that Chu Feng had no intention of killing anyone here. The extent to which he heeded Chu Feng&rsquo;s will was almost as if the latter was his master.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, thanks for sparing our lives. Lord Daoist Sixth Dragon, thanks for sparing our lives&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>Countless voices sounded right after. Some even began sobbing out in repentance. However, there was hardly anyone who thanked Zhou Zhi for speaking up on their </span><span>behalf.</span><br><span>This was simply what the world was like. People cared more about fawning over the strong than showing gratitude to the person who had saved them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Listen well! Young friend Chu Feng is a friend of our Totem Nine Daoists. Anyone who disrespects him will be disrespecting the Totem Nine Daoists too. You can be certain that our Totem Nine Daoists definitely will not spare them regardless of who they may be!&rdquo; Daoist Sixth Dragon declared with a deafening voice as he cast a sharp sweeping glance at the crowd.</span><br><span>Everyone lowered their heads in fright upon hearing those words.</span><br><span>If the crowd was still uncertain as to why the Totem Nine Daoists were protecting Chu Feng, the answer was out now.</span><br><span>The Totem Nine Daoists were famous. There was hardly anyone in the Totem Galaxy who hadn&rsquo;t heard about them. Despite the huge disparity in their strength, they were as close as blood-related brothers. As if to highlight the significance of their bonds, they even intentionally distanced themselves from others.</span><br><span>While they did have partnerships in the past, they had never publicly affirmed having close ties with anyone. This was the first time the Totem Nine Daoists had publicly declared someone to be their friend. Naturally, this added to Chu Feng&rsquo;s halo.</span><br><span>The crowd glanced at the corpse of young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father, and they felt a strong urge to trample all over it. Young master Bai Yue&rsquo;s father had told them that Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t have any backing whatsoever, but that was clearly nonsense!</span><br><span>They had nearly lost their lives for buying into that nonsense!</span><br><span>&ldquo;Eggy, why do you think they are doing this? Is it because of Elder Tao Wu?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>Even though he was unconscious back then, he had heard from Eggy how Tao Wu had flaunted his strength before Daoist Seventh Dragon, Eighth Dragon, and Ninth Dragon. On top of that, he had also threatened to come after them if Chu Feng were to suffer any harm.</span><br><span>And this was the only reason Chu Feng could think of regarding the Totem Nine Daoists&rsquo; abrupt change in attitude. It was just a bit baffling to him that powerhouses like the Totem Nine Daoists would be so easily intimidated by Tao Wu to do his bidding.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably it. Who could have thought that Tao Wu&rsquo;s random scare would actually bring four lackeys under your wing? Hahaha! We should make sure to properly thank Tao Wu the next time we meet him!&rdquo; Eggy was more than pleased with this development that she could hardly suppress her smile.</span><br><span>Shoosh!</span><br><span>Daoist Sixth Dragon picked up the awakened crystal and stowed away the treasures and origin energies of young master Bai Yue, his father, and the others.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Daoist Sixth Dragon handed over the items he had gathered to Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Thank you, elder.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng bowed to Daoist Sixth Dragon out of gratitude, but he didn&rsquo;t reject the gifts. The origin energies were useful to Eggy, whereas he had a use for those treasures. There was no reason for him to reject Daoist Sixth Dragon&rsquo;s goodwill.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elders, please give me a moment.&rdquo;</span><br><span>After claiming possession of the crystal, Chu Feng noticed that he could transfer it into his World Spirit Space, so he quickly entered his World Spirit Space together with the crystal.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Eggy.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Alternating his gaze between Eggy and the crystal in his hand, Chu Feng suddenly felt a little nervous. He could sense the immense power pulsating from the crystal, but even so, he wasn&rsquo;t sure how useful it would be to Eggy&rsquo;s current condition. After all, her injuries were so severe that it was a miracle that she was still alive right now.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let me see for myself how formidable the crystal you have awakened is,&rdquo; Eggy said with a smile.</span><br><span>Chu Feng channeled his spirit power into the crystal. The crystal shattered into countless fragments before transforming into a whiff of air that surged toward Eggy, instantaneously fusing together with her.</span><br><span>With a sudden glow of light, Eggy&rsquo;s gaseous body started to turn corporeal. By the time the light dissipated, she had already reverted to her original appearance.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Waaa, not bad. Chu Feng, the treasure lives up to its reputation,&rdquo; Eggy remarked with a sweet smile. She was pleasantly surprised by this outcome.</span><br><span>At the very least, she was out of danger now.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was initially excited by the development too, but he frowned upon close examination. While Eggy had recovered her body, she didn&rsquo;t recover her cultivation. It was gladdening that she was finally out of danger, but there was still a long way to go for her to make a full recovery.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with that frown on your face? This is already good progress!&rdquo; Eggy walked up to Chu Feng and pinched his cheeks.</span><br><span>Chu Feng smiled in response and said, &ldquo;Rest assured, Eggy. I&rsquo;ll definitely help you to make a full recovery.&rdquo;</span><br><span>He returned his consciousness to his main body, only to see Zhou Zhi kneeling right in front of him once more.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Zhou Zhi, get up. I have already said that I wouldn&rsquo;t kill your clansmen,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, I know that I am unqualified to be asking this of you, but&hellip; I really don&rsquo;t want to miss this opportunity!&rdquo; Zhou Zhi said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked as he helped Zhou Zhi back to his feet.</span><br><span>&ldquo;My grandfather is on the verge of death. I have long heard about the Totem Nine Daoists&rsquo; incredible means as world spiritists, so&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Chu Feng interjected before Zhou Zhi could finish his sentence.</span><br><span>He glanced at the four daoists.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; the four daoists replied with a smile.</span><br><span>Without waiting for anyone to lead the way, they flitted into a palace built atop the mountain. Chu Feng quickly made his way over too. The Zhou Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief hesitantly followed suit too. While he was afraid of the four daoists, he couldn&rsquo;t back down here since this matter concerned Old Man Zhou&rsquo;s safety.</span><br><span>Inside the palace, there was an emaciated old man lying in the midst of a formation. Needless to say, this old man had to be Old Man Zhou.</span><br><span>Daoist Sixth Dragon stepped forward to diagnose Old Man Zhou&rsquo;s condition. Moments later, he shook his head.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want to help here, but Old Man Zhou&rsquo;s illness is too severe. I&rsquo;m afraid that we aren&rsquo;t able to help him.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The other three daoists didn&rsquo;t bother making a move, knowing that they wouldn&rsquo;t resolve a problem that even Daoist Sixth Dragon was helpless before.</span><br><span>The Zhou Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Zhou Zhi, and the others lowered their heads. Daoist Sixth Dragon had made it clear to them that Old Man Zhou wouldn&rsquo;t be able to survive this ordeal.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>He began making his way toward Old Man Zhou. Despite knowing that it was likely to be futile, he still wanted to give it a try. After all, if not for Old Man Zhou, he would have never been able to acquire that crystal.</span><br><span>However, he frowned after diagnosing Old Man Zhou&rsquo;s condition. Not only was the latter terminally ill, he was also approaching the natural limit of his lifespan. He only had a few more days to live.</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>All of a sudden, powerful energy flowed out from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body into Old Man Zhou&rsquo;s. This sight astonished everyone, including the four daoists.</span><br><span>They could visibly see Old Man Zhou regaining his vitality under the influx of energy.</span><br></p></div>
