        <h1>Chapter 3289</h1>
        <div> - Aweing Everyone<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After being reprimanded by Chu Xuanzhengfa, the entire Chu Heavenly Clan grew quiet.<br>Although the crowd also felt that it was somewhat wrong for them to talk about Chu Feng behind his back, that was most definitely not the main reason why they did not argue with Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>On the contrary, as they were already displeased by Chu Feng&rsquo;s failure in awakening the Bloodline Cultivation Formations, being reprimanded by Chu Xuanzhengfa only caused them to become even more furious.<br>The reason why they did not dare to voice their intense anger was because they were afraid of Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>Furthermore, in addition to Chu Xuanzhengfa, they were afraid of their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>They were merely whining. How could they possibly dare to actually attempt to make things difficult for Chu Feng?<br>Even if they did not fear offending Chu Feng, they were afraid of offending their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanzhengfa, you are forcing us to do things against our will by saying that sort of thing, no?&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, an aged voice was suddenly heard.<br>Turning toward that voice, even Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s expression changed. As for the people that were whining earlier, they revealed joyous looks on their faces.<br>The reason for that was because the old man that spoke was no ordinary old man.<br>The person that had spoken was Chu Hanqing. Not only was he from the same generation as the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Chu Hanxian and Chu Hanpeng, but he was also one of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elders.<br>He was someone who had contributed greatly in banishing Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Feng from the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Because of some personal conflict, he detested Chu Xuanyuan. By association, he also detested Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son.<br>Chu Hanqing had been in closed-door training the entire time. It was only after Chu Feng left for the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm that he exited his closed-door training.<br>After coming out from his closed-door training and learning about Chu Feng, he knew that Chu Feng possessed an extraordinary status in their Chu Heavenly Clan. As such, he did not try to target Chu Feng, nor did he say anything against Chu Feng. However, he still greatly disliked him.<br>Furthermore, it was common knowledge that he disliked Chu Feng.<br>Everyone knew that that Supreme Elder would, sooner or later, make things difficult for Chu Feng.<br>Because of this, when Chu Hanqing stood forth against Chu Xuanzhengfa, the people that were reprimanded by Chu Xuanzhengfa earlier began to brim with vile smiles.<br>The reason for that was because they felt that they had found a backing.<br>Whilst they did not dare to argue with Chu Xuanzhengfa, that Supreme Elder did.<br>Furthermore, in terms of both status and seniority, that Lord Supreme Elder surpassed Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>In fact, after Chu Hanqing appeared, Chu Xuanzhengfa also started to frown. He knew that Chu Hanqing was a difficult character.<br>However, even though he knew that Chu Hanqing was difficult to deal with, Chu Xuanzhengfa did not show any fear. Instead, the anger in his eyes intensified.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Xuanzhengfa detested those people that were unable to accomplish anything for their clan, but would instead create trouble all the time.<br>Those people were ruthless and heartless toward their fellow clansmen. Yet, they would be completely incompetent towards outsiders. In Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s eyes, regardless of how high of a status and seniority those sort of people might possess, they would remain scum.<br>This was even more so as Chu Feng had awakened all eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations and accomplished something completely unprecedented. Yet, those people still dared to insult him like that.<br>Whilst Chu Xuanzhengfa might be able to tolerate such behavior at other times, he would absolutely not tolerate it at that moment..<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, what are you trying to imply? Could it be that you feel that it is right for seniors to criticize a person of the younger generation in such a manner?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa asked with a stern voice. He seemed to be planning to argue against Chu Hanqing.<br>&ldquo;They are merely discussing the facts of the matter, what&rsquo;s wrong with that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No one mentioned that it was wrong for Chu Feng to defeat the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations. On the contrary, he contributed to our clan. That is something that we all know deeply in our hearts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, as a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan, it&rsquo;s his duty to fight for our clan. There is nothing to brag about.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for today, his failure in activating the Bloodline Cultivation Formations is also a fact of the matter. It&rsquo;s a fact that his talent is finite.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Are we not allowed to speak of the fact that he doesn&rsquo;t have sufficient talent?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that Chu Feng can only be praised and not spoken badly of?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since when did our Chu Heavenly Clan have such a scandalous custom?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He, Chu Feng, is a person of the younger generation, not our ancestor.&rdquo;<br>That Supreme Elder grew more and more confident, more and more furious as he spoke. It was as if it was a completely outrageous act, a bloody atrocity that offended the heavens.<br>&ldquo;Hanqing, if Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent is lacking, why don&rsquo;t you tell me who in our Chu Heavenly Clan has talent above Chu Feng, who is able to ascend to the tenth step of the Heavenly Lightning Steps?&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, another voice exploded. After that voice was heard, even Chu Hanqing&rsquo;s arrogant expression dwindled greatly.<br>The reason for that was because the person who had spoken was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent is naturally outstanding. However, his identity is also different from others. He is Chu Hanxian&rsquo;s grandson. As such, it&rsquo;s only natural for our clansmen to have a higher standard for him, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, whilst it is true that he ascended to the Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; tenth step, it&rsquo;s also true that he was unable to activate any Bloodline Cultivation Formations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To sum it up, Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent is indeed inferior to his grandfather&rsquo;s. That too is a fact.&rdquo;<br>Even when faced with the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, that Chu Hanqing did not back off, and instead started to retort.<br>&ldquo;Fact? Humph, how are you so certain that Chu Feng was unable any activate the Bloodline Cultivation Formations?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa snorted coldly.<br>&ldquo;Everyone has witnessed what happened in the forbidden area. Is there even a need for me to say anymore?&rdquo; Chu Hanqing revealed an expression of contempt.<br>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you know if what you all saw was the truth by following me to the forbidden area now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, you will feel ashamed for what you&rsquo;ve said earlier,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s words contained a hidden implication. Chu Hanqing was also able to tell that something was amiss.<br>As such, he wouldn&rsquo;t possibly actually follow Chu Xuanzhengfa to the forbidden area. Instead, he shifted the topic. With a furious tone, he said, &ldquo;You want me to go have a look just because you ordered me to? Who do you think you are?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanzhengfa, even if it were your father standing before me, he wouldn&rsquo;t dare to speak to me with such an attitude.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for you, you are merely the Law Enforcement Hall&rsquo;s Vice Hall Master, whereas I am a Supreme Elder of the Chu Heavenly Clan. You&rsquo;d best not forget your own status.&rdquo;<br>Faced with such an unreasonable Chu Hanqing, Chu Xuanzhengfa did not continue to tangle with him. Instead, he turned to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, clasped his fist and said, &ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, something enormously unexpected has occured to the Bloodline Altar. Please give the order for all clansmen to re-enter the forbidden area.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Something enormously unexpected? Zhengfa, exactly what has happened?&rdquo;<br>At this moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s gaze turned serious.<br>After all, it was something concerning the Bloodline Altar. As such, he must treat the matter seriously.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, the Bloodline Altar has disappeared,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, not to mention the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, all of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen present revealed a stunned expression. Then, they revealed a panicky look of disbelief.<br>The Bloodline Altar had disappeared?<br>Was that for real?<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a burst of wind blew past. The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had disappeared.<br>Immediately afterward, the bodies of Chu Hanqing and the various elders present shifted, and they too disappeared.<br>Witnessing that scene, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen present all soared into the sky.<br>They all knew where their Lord Clan Chief, Chu Hanqing and the others had gone to. All of them most definitely proceeded directly for the forbidden area.<br>Not knowing what had happened, the crowd also rushed toward the forbidden area to check things out.<br>The Bloodline Altar was of enormous importance to them. If it truly disappeared, it would be a catastrophe for their Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;The Bloodline Altar disappeared?&rdquo;<br>At the moment when everyone was rushing toward the forbidden area, Chu Feng was standing before his palace entrance with a slightly dumbfounded look.<br>He was stunned by the news. The reason for that was because he felt such a thing to be very improbable.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, congratulations.&rdquo;<br>Right when Chu Feng was dumbfounded, a figure appeared before Chu Feng. It was Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>&ldquo;Congratulations? Senior, what is there to congratulate me for?&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to Chu Xuanzhengfa in bewilderment.<br>&ldquo;Go to the forbidden area and have a look. You&rsquo;ll know then,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa replied with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Senior, did the Bloodline Altar really disappear?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, it has disappeared,&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa answered.<br>&ldquo;Senior, why do you not have a worried look on your face? Why are you instead congratulating me even though the Bloodline Altar has disappeared?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt that the situation was very abnormal. Logically, if the Bloodline Altar had disappeared, Chu Xuanzhengfa should be feeling dismay and sadness. How could he possibly smile?<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was unable to understand what was happening. Merely, he had a faint feeling that it seemed like something good had happened.<br>&ldquo;Haha,&rdquo; hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s question, the smile on Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s face grew even stronger.<br>&ldquo;Go to the forbidden area and have a look. You&rsquo;ll understand then,&rdquo; as Chu Xuanzhengfa spoke, he waved his sleeve. In the next moment, both he and Chu Feng disappeared.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s flying speed was very fast. Being brought along with Chu Xuanzhengfa, Chu Feng was unable to see anything. His surroundings were very vague and indistinct.<br>When Chu Feng&rsquo;s vision returned, he discovered that he was already deep inside the forbidden area. Apart from Chu Xuanzhengfa, Chu Hanpeng was also in the forbidden area.<br>Of course, the people that had left first after Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s announcement, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Chu Hanqing and the other elders, had all arrived as well.<br>Merely, at that moment, all of the people present had astonished looks on their faces. Even Chu Feng himself was astonished by the scene before him.<br>Not long afterward, the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan began to arrive in succession.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, am I seeing this correctly?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; exactly what happened?&rdquo;<br>Without exception, when the people that arrived saw the scene before them, astonishment and disbelief filled their faces.<br></p></div>
