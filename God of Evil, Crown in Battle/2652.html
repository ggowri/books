        <div> - No Other Choice<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Although I do not know where you obtained that Demon Armament, don&rsquo;t you think that you can scare this old man away with merely that Demon Armament,&rdquo; Chu Bore said coldly.<br>Not only did he not show any sign of wanting to retreat, but he instead had a mocking expression on his face.<br>It was as if he had seen through Chu Feng&rsquo;s intention.<br>In the beginning, Chu Feng thought that Chu Bore was merely bluffing. Thus, his expression remained unchanged, and he even smiled coldly. He was planning to continue to speak and scare Chu Bore.<br>However, right at that moment, Chu Bore suddenly stopped operating the unsealing formation. He flipped his hand, and an item appeared in his hand.<br>It was a Cosmos Sack.<br>&ldquo;That is?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed upon seeing that Cosmos Sack. He recognized that Cosmos Sack. It was the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack.<br>When he fought against the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster earlier, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster had that Cosmos Sack the entire time. Chu Feng had no idea when that Cosmos Sack had entered that old man&rsquo;s hand.<br>That said, it was not surprising for the old man to possess that Cosmos Sack. After all, he possessed unfathomable strength. It would naturally be extremely easy for him to secretly take something like that away.<br>Merely, Chu Feng did not understand why the old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan would take out the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack.<br>In terms of treasures, the treasures inside the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack would definitely not be able to compare to the treasures he possessed. After all, he was someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Right at that moment, the old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan took out an item from the Cosmos Sack.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you still recognize this?&rdquo; Chu Bore asked Chu Feng while holding an item.<br>It was a jade pendant. The jade pendant was gold in color, and had a circular shape. Once it appeared, it immediately emitted a very strong Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura.<br>Most importantly, there were two large characters written in ancient calligraphy on the center of the circular jade pendant. They were &lsquo;Demon Suppression!!!&rsquo;<br>How could Chu Feng not recognize that jade pendant? It was the treasure that was capable of suppressing even his Evil God Sword, the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman.<br>&ldquo;How did you obtain that Demon Armament Suppression Talisman?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be&hellip;?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart tightened. That Demon Armament Suppression Talisman should be with the Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Chu Feng did not see the Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief among the crowd present. Even his corpse was not among the dead.<br>This meant that the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster had gone and obtained the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman for the sake of handling him. As for the Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, he might already have been killed by the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>However, that was not what Chu Feng was worried about. After all, the Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was not a good person anyways. Even if he were to die, his death would not wipe away his crimes.<br>Chu Feng merely regretted not being able to kill him himself.<br>That said, Chu Feng was very worried. He was anxious because of the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman. After all, that Demon Armament Suppression Talisman was indeed capable of suppressing the power of the Evil God Sword.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, so even you know fear?&rdquo;<br>Seemingly seeing through the worry in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart, a proud smile emerged on Chu Bore&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is afraid? Why would he be afraid? Could it be because of that jade pendant?&rdquo;<br>Hearing what Chu Bore said, the crowd cast their eyes to the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman.<br>Apart from Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi, this was the first time that all the others had seen that Demon Armament Suppression Talisman. They did not know what the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman could do.<br>Although the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman appeared extraordinary, they were still unable to understand why Chu Feng would fear a mere jade pendant.<br>After all, Chu Feng&rsquo;s current aura surpassed that of Chu Bore. Furthermore, he had even managed to injure Chu Bore.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Bore gently raised his hand and tossed out the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman.<br>Once the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman entered the sky, it reacted as if it had been liberated.<br>Immediately after, it started to emit dazzling golden light. Not only did that golden light grow more and more dazzling, but many characters also began to appear.<br>Those characters were flowing out from the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman. Following the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman, they began to scatter and fill its surroundings.<br>It was as if the golden light was the sea, and those characters were fishes.<br>Just like that, those characters started to gallop in the sea, covering all the places the golden light reached.<br>Those characters were very ancient. They were most likely characters from the Ancient Era. Furthermore, one could not interpret them.<br>However, when those characters appeared, the power of the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman started to increase.<br>Chu Feng and the others were even able to hear an ancient voice sounding from the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman.<br>They were simply unable to understand that voice. However, they felt a very sacred sensation from it.<br>At that moment, the crimson clouds that filled the sky started to wane. The Infant Soul Grand Formation once again appeared before the crowd&rsquo;s field of view.<br>At the same time, the Evil God Sword Chu Feng held in his hand started to tremble violently. It was as if it were feeling extremely unreconciled with what was happening.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, exactly what is that jade pendant?! It was actually able to curb Chu Feng&rsquo;s Demon Armament?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd came to a sudden realization. They finally understood why Chu Feng would show fear toward that Demon Armament Suppression Talisman.<br>After knowing the truth, the crowd started to panic.<br>Although the power of Chu Feng&rsquo;s Evil God Sword brought them great unease, it remained that Chu Feng was their only hope right now. If Chu Feng&rsquo;s Evil God Sword was curbed, they would not be able to escape the imminent calamity, and would definitely be killed.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, now&hellip; what can you possibly contend against this old man with?&rdquo; The expression of complacence grew more and more concentrated on Chu Bore&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;Boy, hand your body to this Evil God. This Evil God will help you eliminate this trash,&rdquo; right at that moment, the Evil God Sword&rsquo;s voice sounded again.<br>&ldquo;If I am to hand my body over to you, will you be able to break through the restriction of that Demon Armament Suppression Talisman?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Did you really think that thing would be able to suppress this Evil God&rsquo;s power? You are merely too weak, and unable to unleash this Evil God&rsquo;s powers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If this Evil God is to take control, I will immediately have them know who the true ruler is,&rdquo; the Evil God Sword said.<br>&ldquo;If I am to hand my body over to you, can you not willfully slaughter the innocent?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;This Evil God promises you that I will only kill those you want to kill,&rdquo; the Evil God Sword said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, the Evil God Sword is simply untrustworthy. You absolutely must not hand your body over to it,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen hurriedly spoke against it.<br>She had managed to understand Chu Feng&rsquo;s intention from his words. Chu Feng was planning to hand his body over to the Evil God Sword.<br>However, the intention of the Evil God Sword was extremely obvious. It wanted to take control of Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. If Chu Feng were to hand his body over to it, it would be no different from death.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, I&rsquo;m sorry. There&rsquo;s really no other choice for me right now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Allow me to take this gamble,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Eggy with a wry smile on his face.<br>How could Chu Feng not know how dangerous the Evil God Sword was?<br>However, it was as Chu Feng said. There was no other option for him.<br>If he were to hand his body to the Evil God Sword and release the true power of the Evil God Sword, he would be able to kill that old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan and prevent a catastrophe.<br>As long as the Evil God Sword honored its promise, his friends would be able to continue living.<br>As for his body, even though it would be occupied by the Evil God Sword, it did not mean that there would be no chance for him to take it back. At the very least&hellip; this option was a path to survival.<br><br></p></div>
