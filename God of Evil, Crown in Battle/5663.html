        <h1>Chapter 5663: You May Go, Young Friend</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their teamwork, they finished the formation within less than half of an incense stick&rsquo;s time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xia Xingchen was overjoyed. She had seen the formation inside this stone hall many times, but this was the strongest one ever. There was once the </span><span>sectmaster</span><span> used two stone amulets to invoke the formation, but its prowess was still not on par with the one she had just constructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that this formation was only this strong thanks to Chu Feng&rsquo;s help, she turned to him and complimented, &ldquo;Not bad. You&rsquo;re better than I thought.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her stone amulet ensured the successful construction of the formation, it was Chu Feng&rsquo;s sharp control of spirit power that pushed the formation toward a height no one in their Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect had ever reached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, all the best for your cultivation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Cultivate?&rdquo; Xia Xingchen was initially taken aback to hear that word before bursting into laughter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised that you know that this formation does more than treating my injuries.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course. I told you I know a thing or two about this place,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had received other information about the stone hall alongside the Immemorial Meditation Method. Even though the stone hall was constructed around the Nine Heavens Secret Domain&rsquo;s teleportation formation, it was a trove of treasures too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its greatest treasure was the Immemorial Meditation Method, followed by the cultivation formation they had just activated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Immemorial Meditation Method was so valuable that it could have been considered one of the most important assets of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, guarded with the highest level of security so as to ensure that it never fell into the hands of an outsider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, only one person could receive the Immemorial Meditation Method from this stone hall, which was why Chu Feng was glad that no one else had grasped it before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cultivation formation wasn&rsquo;t as exclusive as the Immemorial Meditation Method, but there was a limit to how many times it could be used. He could tell that the cultivation formation was powered by the inscriptions on the walls, but their energy had been mostly depleted by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only three inscriptions in the stone hall still contained energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng had fully invoked the energy inside those three inscriptions, which was why the cultivation formation constructed this time around was extraordinarily powerful. However, this also meant that the cultivation formation couldn&rsquo;t be used anymore, since its source of power had been completely drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Brat, I&rsquo;ll be counting on you,&rdquo; Xia Xingchen said as she formed a hand seal to invoke the teleportation energy inside the cultivation formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then vanished together with the formation, leaving the stone hall empty as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng knew that Xia Xingchen was in one of the three inscriptions on the wall, and he could pinpoint which one she was in too. As the core of the cultivation </span><span>formation, he could ruin the formation by destroying the inscription, and Xia Xingchen would suffer a backlash, though it was for the same reason he was currently trapped inside the stone hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was an extremely complicated cultivation formation, but its prowess was formidable. He could sense Xia Xingchen&rsquo;s cultivation swiftly recovering. It didn&rsquo;t take long for her cultivation to reach rank three True God level, which was her actual cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she didn&rsquo;t stop there. She was seeking not just to raise her cultivation level but to master a cultivation method. Chu Feng could sense that it was an extremely powerful cultivation method.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope the reinforcement from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect doesn&rsquo;t come too quickly,&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of being unable to leave this stone hall, he couldn&rsquo;t exert his spirit power either. He couldn&rsquo;t use any of his concealment means due to that, which meant that he would be a goner if the others from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect arrived here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, Chu Feng looked at the entrance of the stone hall with a livid expression. He sensed that someone had activated the entrance formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be that unlucky, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two figures appeared in the stone hall outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was a beautiful woman with her hair combed neatly in place. She looked young even though she wasn&rsquo;t a junior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other was an old man with an emaciated body reminiscent of a dried corpse, but his eyes looked even more vicious than those of ravenous wolves. He had thick hair, though he was bald in the middle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them were dressed in the robes of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect. Chu Feng noticed that the old man was carrying a token bearing the words &lsquo;Enforcement Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Who are you? Why are you in our forbidden land?&rdquo; the woman asked as she exerted her oppressive might on Chu Feng, crushing him onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng knew right away that she was Xia Xingchen&rsquo;s maid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hold it right there.&rdquo; The bald elder stopped her with a wave of his hand. He walked into the stone hall and first examined the inscriptions on the walls before personally helping Chu Feng up from the ground. &ldquo;Young friend, may I know your name?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng.&rdquo; Chu Feng knew that there was no point concealing his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo; The bald elder took a moment to assess Chu Feng from head to toe before his eyes suddenly lit up. &ldquo;I know you! You&rsquo;re good friends with Long Chengyu, the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s young master. I didn&rsquo;t expect you to be a good friend of our sect&rsquo;s Xia Xingchen too.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xia Xingchen&rsquo;s maid widened her eyes in realization, as she pointed her finger at Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Were you the one who saved Xia Xingchen?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bald elder glared at Xia Xingchen&rsquo;s maid with such menacing eyes that the latter trembled and quickly zipped her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Xia Xingchen. I came here by coincidence,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I see. Since you&rsquo;re acquainted with the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s young master, I shan&rsquo;t pursue this matter. You may leave now,&rdquo; the bald elder said.</span></p></div>
