        <h1>Chapter 5611: Someone Familiar</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to head there?&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> and </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span> looked at Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There are two roads before us. One is to head to that mountain, but the rewards are limited based on what I have observed. The alternative is to use our tokens. These tokens are an entrance too, but we&rsquo;ll have to activate them. It&rsquo;ll be tougher, but the rewards are higher too,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> took out an exquisite compass with a flick of his wrist. The compass emanated an extremely old aura that indicated that it was a treasure from the Immemorial Era.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is this the compass that allowed him to reach this boulder before me?&rdquo; Chu Feng could tell that the compass was an invaluable treasure harnessing immense power. It was likely to be even stronger than his Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The compass&rsquo; needle was wavering among three points, namely Chu Feng, </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span>, and </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;These tokens are really entrances,&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> exclaimed in delight. He turned to Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Do you know how to decipher the tokens?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Channel your consciousness into your token; there should be a trial awaiting you there. However, I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;ll be able to cooperate on the trial. We&rsquo;ll have to clear it with our own capability,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give it a try, but let&rsquo;s not enter the entrance if you figure out the way to clear the trial. Return here and share your insights with the others instead,&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I suspect that we&rsquo;ll be pulled into the entrance as soon as we clear the trial, but I&rsquo;ll try my best to return </span><span>here</span><span> if possible,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he inspected the token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, his consciousness was pulled into another dimension reminiscent of a labyrinth. There was a huge incense stick floating above the labyrinth, which most likely served as a timer. He had roughly two hours to clear the labyrinth judging by the rate it was burning down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The labyrinth was harder than Chu Feng had expected. He failed to figure a way out of the labyrinth before the incense stick burned down, and his consciousness was sent back to his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> and </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span> staring at the tokens in their hands, but their bodies were stiffened. Clearly, they had projected their consciousness into their tokens too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not too long later, the two of them began to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> turned to Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Did you enter a labyrinth with a time limit of two hours too?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I did, but I failed the trial,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. I failed the trial too, but I think we&rsquo;re able to attempt it again. Why don&rsquo;t we share what we found first?&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He constructed a formation to share his findings from the labyrinth. He also drew out the path that he thought was the right one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not right. Why are our labyrinths different?&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> said with a frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weng!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span> used his martial power to draw out the labyrinth. His mapping of the labyrinth was incomplete, but it was clearly different from Chu Feng&rsquo;s.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This is the one I saw earlier,&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This is bad. Our labyrinths are different. We can&rsquo;t exchange insights like that,&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> said with a frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let me give it another try,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he projected his consciousness into his token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his astonishment, the labyrinth he entered this time around was different from the one he had entered. It didn&rsquo;t match the ones </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span> and </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> drew too. It would appear that the labyrinth would change every time they entered it, rendering whatever they learned from the previous time useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that it&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This challenge didn&rsquo;t shake Chu Feng&rsquo;s confidence; if anything, it only made him even more determined to pull it through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours passed in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> and </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span> regained consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This is too much! The labyrinth is different from before!&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same for me too,&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span> replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This is too difficult. I don&rsquo;t think I can clear it. I&rsquo;ll be counting on you for this,&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can do it either.&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span> shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, is it the same for you too? Did you enter a </span><span>brand new</span><span> labyrinth?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Much to </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian&rsquo;s</span><span> surprise, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng isn&rsquo;t out yet? He went in earlier than us!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Chu Feng transformed into a whiff of smoke and seeped into his token. Then, his token vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;My gosh. Did he succeed?&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s incredible,&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span> said with a sigh. He was certain that Chu Feng had gotten in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s indeed formidable,&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> remarked with a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, the two of them frowned upon sensing something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Damn it! Why now?&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> frowned worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We knew that they would discover our absence when we came out. What are you so surprised by,&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I find it a pity that they found us so early. Just a little longer, and we would have been able to explore the Nine Realms Immortal Region. How annoying!&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> was displeased, but he quickly thought of something and turned to </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span>. &ldquo;Since we have been found anyway, why don&rsquo;t we complete our exploration before heading back?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being too optimistic. The punishment will be lighter if we return right now,&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;But this is the Nine Realms Immortal Region. It&rsquo;s a rare opportunity! We have been trapped there from a young age, and it wasn&rsquo;t easy for us to get out. </span><span>Tianxue</span><span>, let&rsquo;s play a little longer.&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> looked at </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span> with pleading eyes, as if the latter was the only one who could decide for them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m heading back. You do whatever you want,&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span> replied before leaving the area. He headed not for the mountain peak but another direction, presumably where he had identified as the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Seriously&hellip;&rdquo; </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> was indignant, but he rose into the air and chased after </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span> too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng had entered another dimension, where he found himself floating above a clearwater lake that spanned the size of an ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is that the water of the Immortal Stream?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Looks like it,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he heaved a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng?!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng suddenly heard an awfully familiar voice behind him that jolted his heart. It was someone whom he recognized. He quickly turned around and took a look&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone he knew was indeed standing not too far away, staring at him with a look of surprise.</span></p></div>
