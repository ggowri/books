        <div> - The Mysterious Wasteland<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>Ying Mingchao extended his hand and grabbed tightly onto Zi Xunyi.<br>Right now, there was only a single light vortex left. He felt that one among them would definitely not be able to escape from the calamity.<br>He did not wish for anything to happen to Zi Xunyi. Thus, he decided that if the person to be sucked into the light vortex was Zi Xunyi, he would follow Zi Xunyi into the light vortex.<br>However, if he were the one to be sucked into the light vortex, he would immediately let go of Zi Xunyi so that he could face this unknown danger alone.<br>&ldquo;Xunyi, you&hellip;&rdquo; Right at that moment, Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>He discovered that Zi Xunyi had tightly grabbed onto the corner of his clothes with her other hand.<br>It seemed that Zi Xunyi was thinking the same thing as him.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Finally, the last light vortex arrived. It was coming straight for them.<br>Merely, the attractive power from the light vortex was not only restricting one of them. Instead, it was restricting both of them.<br>It was not that Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi were tightly holding onto one another. Rather, that attractive power had enveloped both of them at the same time. Just like that, the two of them were sucked into the light vortex.<br>After the two of them entered the light vortex, that light vortex immediately disappeared.<br>This place turned pitch-black once again. Only the starlight in the distance could be seen.<br>Although that starlight was beautiful, their lights were very weak. As such, they were unable to illuminate the vast Outer World.<br>Thus, darkness became the main hue of the Outer World.<br>However, that darkness did not represent something being dismal and gloomy. Rather, it represented the mysteriousness of the unknown, and how vast and boundless the Outer World was.<br>.............<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~~&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng was sucked into the light vortex, he felt that his head was completely blank.<br>However, he soon discovered that he had broken free from the power restricting him.<br>With a &lsquo;putt,&rsquo; Chu Feng landed on the ground.<br>Chu Feng discovered that he had landed somewhere.<br>Where he landed was a desolate plain. It was completely barren, and without a single blade of grass. There was a scorching sun above it. Furthermore, that desolate plain was vast and boundless.<br>Chu Feng raised his head, and discovered that there was a light vortex in midair.<br>That light vortex was the same as the one he saw in the Stairway to Heaven. The only difference was that this light vortex was smaller.<br>It was much smaller. The light vortex before was like a sun capable of engulfing everything. As for the current light vortex, it could only allow several people to enter it simultaneously.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng soared into the sky. He was flying toward that light vortex.<br>Chu Feng felt that he had exited from that light vortex. In that case, that light vortex should be connected to the Stairway to Heaven.<br>Chu Feng felt that if he were to enter it now, he might be able to return to the Stairway to Heaven and meet Wang Qiang and the others again.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo;<br>A loud noise was heard. Chu Feng grabbed his head and started to grimace in pain.<br>That light vortex was like a steel plate. Chu Feng was simply unable to enter it at all. However, his attempt to enter it left a large bruise on his head.<br>One must know that Chu Feng was currently a True Immortal. He possessed an undying and indestructible body. As long as his soul remained, he would not feel pain even if his body was torn to pieces and his bones were crushed.<br>This was the greatness of True Immortals. They had already surpassed the limits of humanity, and would not be limited by their bodies.<br>However, a large bruise actually appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s head. Furthermore, it was very painful.<br>This could only mean one thing.<br>That is, the light vortex was simply too strange. It was actually capable of injuring Chu Feng.<br>It was as if the indestructible bodies of True Immortal-level experts were ineffective before the light vortex.<br>&ldquo;I refuse to believe this.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng suddenly took out his Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler. He aimed it at the light vortex and thrust forth.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>A loud noise was heard, and Chu Feng was actually knocked away. The Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler he held in his hand was trembling nonstop. Even Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand had turned numb.<br>&ldquo;It seems that you won&rsquo;t be able to return,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! Exactly what is this? This is simply too strange!&rdquo; Chu Feng knew that he would not be able to do anything to that light vortex with the power he possessed.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve most likely entered another world, another realm. You should rejoice that you haven&rsquo;t been drawn into the vast Outer World, the boundless starry sky. You were already extremely lucky,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng agreed with Her Lady Queen. If he were truly drawn into the endless starry sky, that vast and boundless place, then, with the strength that he possessed, he would likely not be able to reach a single world in his entire lifetime. Just like that, he would continue to drift through the darkness till the day he died.<br>With no other option, Chu Feng decided to inspect his surroundings. He discovered&hellip; that if the light vortex was ignored, then there was nothing distinctive about the place.<br>It merely resembled an ordinary wasteland.<br>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed. He discovered a book.<br>That book was buried in the soil. If he didn&rsquo;t pay close attention to it, he would&rsquo;ve simply not found it. However, Chu Feng had discovered it.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng extend his hand and grabbed. Immediately, attractive power emerged from his palm. The soil surrounding the book started to fly, and then that book that was buried among the soil flew into Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>Chu Feng blew away the remaining soil and dust around the book and then opened it up.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding.&rdquo;<br>Immediately, Chu Feng revealed a dumbstruck expression.<br>There was nothing on the cover of the book.<br>However, after opening the book and reaching the first page, there were several large characters written on it.<br>Immortal Taboo Martial Skill. Immortal Taboo: Blood Lightning Technique.<br>Immortal Taboo Martial Skill? The book that he had discovered in the soil in such a place was actually an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill?<br>Although Chu Feng was astonished by it, he did not believe that it was an actual Immortal Taboo Martial Skill.<br>That said, it remained that Chu Feng was curious. Thus, he began to flip through the pages.<br>Once he started reading its contents, Chu Feng grew more and more astonished.<br>Based on his own judgement, Chu Feng felt that the book was real. It really was an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill.<br>Heavens! It was an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill, something that had never appeared in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm before. He had actually managed to randomly discover a legendary martial skill in that place.<br>This was simply too unimaginable.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what sort of place is this? Could it be that this is a treasure deposit?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng began to survey his surroundings again. However, he discovered that it did not resemble a treasure deposit at all. It was clearly a desolate plain, a barren wasteland.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, continue to look around. Perhaps you might discover more treasures,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen was so excited that her eyes started to shine. She was much more excited than Chu Feng himself.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; this time around, Chu Feng decided to activate his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to carefully search his surroundings.<br>Sure enough, Chu Feng soon discovered another item. It was an earthen jar. It too was buried in the soil.<br>However, Chu Feng felt that the jar was most definitely a treasure. The reason for that was because he was unable to see through the jar even with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>This time around, Chu Feng did not directly use his power to suck the earthen jar into his hand. Rather, he decided to walk toward the jar and carefully open up the soil surrounding it to personally pick up the jar.<br>The jar was completely black in color. It looked very simple and unadorned, and was also a bit shabby in appearance.<br>There was a lid on the jar. That lid was very tight.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, do you think&hellip; I should open this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course you should. There might be treasures inside. It might even be an actual Immortal Armament,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;How could such a small jar contain an Immortal Armament?&rdquo; Chu Feng was skeptical. The jar he held in his hand was not very large. It was about the same size as an ordinary person&rsquo;s head. Such a size would not be able to hold an Immortal Armament.<br>&ldquo;Are you stupid? What if there&rsquo;s an isolated space inside the jar?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Then let me try opening it,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he extended his hand and planned to attempt to open the jar.<br>However, right at that moment, Her Lady Queen shouted, &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;<br>Nervousness filled her voice. It was as if Chu Feng had made an enormous blunder.<br><br></p></div>
