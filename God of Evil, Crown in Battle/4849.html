        <div>: Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s Affair<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve underestimated this fellow. Brother Chu, stay away. Don&rsquo;t worry, she won&rsquo;t be able to hurt you as long as I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said as he released an even stronger burst of power.<br>It looked like he was determined to teach the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple a lesson.<br>However, the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple had no intention of backing down. She even glared at Duan Liufeng with killing intent in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Hold it right there!&rdquo; a voice suddenly boomed.<br>Following that, the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple suddenly turned obedient. There was even an aggrieved look on her face, as if she had been bullied.<br>She was reacting in such a way because the person who had just spoken was the sectmaster.<br>The sectmaster had regained her consciousness, and she standing not too far away, looking at Duan Liufeng and the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple. She seemed to be in a good condition.<br>It was just that her appearance was still that of an old grandmother. She didn&rsquo;t regain her youthful look.<br>&ldquo;Master, Elder Duan bullied me!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the sectmaster was fine, the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple rushed to the sectmaster&rsquo;s side and lodged a complaint.<br>&ldquo;You dare to put on an act before me?&rdquo;<br>However, the sectmaster glared at the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple with sharp eyes.<br>&ldquo;Master, please forgive me.&rdquo;<br>The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple was intimidated by those eyes that she actually kneeled down subserviently despite her usual arrogant personality. She was completely different from how she usually acted.<br>She looked like a young child who was afraid of being punished after doing something wrong.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, you&rsquo;re fine!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng and Duan Liufeng rushed to the sectmaster&rsquo;s side, delighted to see that she was doing well.<br>As for the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple, they didn&rsquo;t have to worry about her anymore now that the sectmaster was here to settle the matter.<br>&ldquo;You need not worry about my condition. Chu Feng, tell me what happened,&rdquo; the sectmaster ordered.<br>Chu Feng quickly filled her in on the situation.<br>&ldquo;Wen Xue, tell me the truth. What is it that you have left inside Chu Feng&rsquo;s body? If you lie to me, I&rsquo;ll lock you up once again,&rdquo; the sectmaster said.<br>Even though her eyes were directed on the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple, Chu Feng and Duan Liufeng could sense the pressure from her gaze.<br>&ldquo;Master, it&rsquo;s my Life Soul. I was afraid that Chu Feng would find out about it and refuse to return it to me, so I didn&rsquo;t tell him about it. I just wanted to take back my Life Soul; I had no intention of hurting him at all!&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple said.<br>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me that your Life Soul is with Chu Feng?&rdquo; the sectmaster asked.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip; didn&rsquo;t want master to know what I&rsquo;ve done to Chu Feng. I&rsquo;m afraid that you would berate me,&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple said.<br>&ldquo;You also know that you&rsquo;ve done wrong?&rdquo; the sectmaster berated.<br>&ldquo;Master, that was before I met you! I&rsquo;m already a changed person now. I won&rsquo;t do evil anymore,&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple clarified.<br>&ldquo;Still, you have to pay the price of your previous folly. Since your Life Soul is with Chu Feng at the moment, he should have the right to decide whether to return it to you or not,&rdquo; the sectmaster said.<br>She turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the decision up to you.&rdquo;<br>But at the same time, she sent a voice transmission into Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears, &ldquo;Chu Feng, the fact that her Life Soul is with you means that she won&rsquo;t be able to live if you lose your life. As long as you grasp tightly onto her Life Soul, she won&rsquo;t be able to take it away from you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng understood the sectmaster&rsquo;s drift right away. She didn&rsquo;t want him to return the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple her Life Soul.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if I entrust her Life Soul into your hands?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied through voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t work. You know about her origin too. She isn&rsquo;t as simple as you appears on the surface. She should be able to sense where her Life Soul is. If you hand her Life Soul to me, she&rsquo;ll start bothering me for it. It&rsquo;ll put me in a spot. It&rsquo;s much better to leave it with you instead,&rdquo; the sectmaster replied via voice transmission.<br>Chu Feng knew what to do, so he revealed his decision aloud, &ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, I also think that a person has to be punished for his mistakes. Otherwise, it won&rsquo;t be fair for others.&rdquo;<br>He turned to the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple and said, &ldquo;My apologies, but I can&rsquo;t return your Life Soul to you yet.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple gritted her teeth furiously upon hearing those words. She turned to the sectmaster and hugged her arm.<br>&ldquo;Master, look! Chu Feng doesn&rsquo;t want to return me my Life Soul! How can I leave my Life Soul in the hands of another person? I&rsquo;ll die if something happens to him!<br>&ldquo;Do you know how much of a troublemaker that Chu Feng is? What if he bumps into an expert who kills him in a single palm? I&rsquo;ll die along with him! If that were to happen, I&rsquo;ll never be able to rest in peace! Master, you need to stand up for me!&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple complained pitifully.<br>Chu Feng frowned upon hearing those words.<br>Me, a troublemaker? I have never been the one causing trouble. It&rsquo;s others who keep trying to provoke me!<br>The sectmaster shook her head and replied, &ldquo;That Life Soul is Chu Feng&rsquo;s property now. I don&rsquo;t have the authority to interfere with his decision. You should head back now. Also, consider this a warning. I&rsquo;ll overlook your act of aggression against a fellow sect member today, but I won&rsquo;t go easy on you if you dare do it again!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I understand, master. I won&rsquo;t dare to do it ever again.&rdquo;<br>As indignant as the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple felt, she seemed to be truly frightened of the sectmaster, such that she obediently stood up and started walking away.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, heed my words. One day, I&rsquo;ll make you return my Life Soul to me willingly!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes yes, I heard you, Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple. Ah, should I call you Wen Xue instead?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.<br>&ldquo;Bastard, that name is not something you&rsquo;re worthy of calling! Only my master can call me that!&rdquo;<br>The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple shot a glare at Chu Feng before quickly leaving the area.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, if you knew that lass is a demon, why do you still keep her by your side?&rdquo; Duan Liufeng asked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny that she&rsquo;s a problematic one, but she&rsquo;s also a valuable talent to our sect. Our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect needs to bulk up. We can&rsquo;t just rely on Chu Feng and Zi Ling for that. Don&rsquo;t worry, I can keep her in check,&rdquo; the sectmaster said.<br>Duan Liufeng was still worried about it, but since the sectmaster had already made up her mind, there was no point harping on this issue anymore.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you love Long Xiaoxiao?&rdquo; the sectmaster suddenly turned to Chu Feng and asked.<br>&ldquo;I do not love Long Xiaoxiao,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, you shouldn&rsquo;t interfere in her business,&rdquo; the sectmaster replied.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, while I don&rsquo;t harbor any feelings for Long Xiaoxiao, she&rsquo;s still my friend. I can&rsquo;t just turn a blind eye to her plight when she&rsquo;s in danger.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, do you know what happened to Long Xiaoxiao? Can you tell me about it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Are the two of you really just friends?&rdquo; the sectmaster asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re just friends,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>The sectmaster eyed Chu Feng intently, as if trying to determine whether he was lying or not. It was only a moment later that the sharpness in her eyes finally vanished.<br>&ldquo;That lass is indeed in trouble. Her father wishes her to marry into the Holy Light Clan, but she refuses to abide by his wish. So, she ruined her own appearance to the extent where it&rsquo;s no longer reparable. However, the Holy Light Clan still refuses to let her go.<br>&ldquo;The entire Dragon Clan is currently at risk of destruction,&rdquo; the sectmaster said.<br></p></div>
