        <h1>Chapter 1484</h1>
        <div> - Exterminating Qin Lingyun<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Absolute silence. Other than the sound of heartbeats, even the sound of breathing could not be heard.<br>Chu Feng had forced Qin Lingyun to kneel. This scene had stunned and frightened a lot of people.<br>However, the ones who were the most frightened would be Bai Yunxiao, Zhao Jingang, Qi Yanyu, Tao Xiangyu and the others with them.<br>They had been no match for Chu Feng long ago. However, they had firmly believed that Qin Lingyun was an existence who Chu Feng feared, and that as long as Qin Lingyun was present, Chu Feng would never be the number one disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain. He would always have an obstruction, someone that he feared. In turn, he would not dare to act wantonly.<br>However, the scene before them had completely and utterly destroyed their final hope, their final faith, their final trump card.<br>&ldquo;All of you, kneel!&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed to Bai Yunxiao, Zhao Jingang, Qi Yanyu, Tao Xiangyu and the others.<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words from Chu Feng, not to mention Tao Xiangyu and the others, even the remaining disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain instantly knelt onto the ground.<br>It was not that they did not have integrity. Rather, it was that Chu Feng&rsquo;s words were filled with deterrence that cowed them, and they did not dare to not kneel upon hearing his words. As Chu Feng had said to Qin Lingyun: &lsquo;When I want you to kneel, you must kneel. Even if you refuse to kneel, you must still kneel.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;A bunch of trash with no backbone,&rdquo; Seeing how Bai Yunxiao, Tao Xiangyu and the others knelt this quickly, Qin Lingyun was so enraged that his complexion turned deep red. It was as if he could explode at any moment.<br>Bai Yunxiao, Tao Xiangyu and the others lowered their heads in silence. They did not dare to look at Qin Lingyun, nor did they dare to look at Chu Feng. Although they felt that they were extremely humiliated right now, there was nothing they could do.<br>&ldquo;Well well well, see how you all dare to act arrogant again. Weren&rsquo;t you all so aggressively arrogant before? So why are you all kneeling right now? Seems like you&rsquo;re a bunch of trash that will only bully the weak but are afraid of the strong! Pah!!&rdquo;<br>Sima Ying started to jump and hop around Tao Xiangyu and the others. In fact, she even started to clap and cheer. She was truly overjoyed. It was as if Tao Xiangyu and the others were kneeling to her.<br>&ldquo;Qin Lingyun, I&rsquo;ll give you a chance. You either take out the banner key, or else I&rsquo;ll exterminate you right now.&rdquo; Chu Feng was still holding onto Qin Lingyun&rsquo;s head as he coldly said those words.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. Chu Feng, while you might be able to scare others, you cannot scare me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exterminate me? If you dare to kill me, don&rsquo;t you think you can continue to live. Do you dare?&rdquo; Qin Lingyun started to laugh loudly. He was certain that Chu Feng did not dare to kill him.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying I don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s brows narrowed as he coldly asked.<br>&ldquo;I bet you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Qin Lingyun said without the slightest hesitation.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Qin Lingyun&rsquo;s words left his mouth, a muffled explosion was heard. Blood started to splatter everywhere. Qin Lingyun&rsquo;s body had been completely torn apart. Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack exploded from within his body, shattering it completely.<br>&ldquo;In this world, there is nothing that I, Chu Feng, do not dare to do,&rdquo; After killing Qin Lingyun, Chu Feng acted as if nothing had happened. There was not the slightest trace of change to his expression. In fact, there seemed to be a bit of delight.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&hellip; you actually killed him&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The crowd was terrified. Even Lin Yezhou, Fu Feiteng and the others had turned pale with fright. Killing a fellow disciple, this was a capital offense that one would be beheaded for!!!<br>&ldquo;Merely trash. So what if I&rsquo;ve killed him? I shall see whether the Cyanwood Mountain will, for the sake of trash like him, kill me,&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke with confidence.<br>He firmly believed that Dugu Xingfeng was already aware of his value. Even if he killed Qin Lingyun, Dugu Xingfeng would, at the very most, punish him, and definitely not kill him.<br>Even if Dugu Xingfeng truly decided to kill him because of external reasons, Chu Feng firmly believed that the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master, Miao Renlong and Hong Qiang would definitely not sit and watch without doing anything.<br>Chu Feng had most definitely not killed Qin Lingyun on impulse. He had already calculated this beforehand. Before he even entered this Ancient Era&rsquo;s Remnants, he was already prepared to kill Qin Lingyun.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s fine to kill a scourge like Qin Lingyun. However, you should have left some bits of him. With that banner key gone, how are you going to obtain the banner?&rdquo; Sima Ying said.<br>Compared to the fearful expression that the others had, Sima Ying was extremely calm. Not only was she calm, she even had a joyous smile on her face. Evidently, she was very happy that Qin Lingyun had been killed by Chu Feng.<br>Once Sima Ying said those words, the crowd became even more speechless. What sort of person was she? How could she say this sort of thing?<br>However, upon further thinking, what Sima Ying said was not without reason. If the final banner key was really on Qin Lingyun, then the banner key would&rsquo;ve been turned to bits alongside Qin Lingyun. Wouldn&rsquo;t this mean that the banner platform could not be opened any longer? That the Nine Powers Hunt this time around would end with no victor?<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>However, at the moment when everyone was guessing, Chu Feng did an astonishing action. He completely shattered all eight of the banner keys in his hand.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on with this fellow? Has he gone insane, or did he give up?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s action came as a great shock to many people.<br>Right at this moment, Chu Feng walked over to the banner platform. With a single thought, boundless spirit power covered the entire banner platform.<br>After that, Chu Feng began to form hand seals with his rapidly changing hands. Following that, his boundless spirit power began to change. In an instant, a spirit formation was created.<br>Not only was that spirit formation flickering with golden light, there were also insect-like marks flowing through it.<br>&ldquo;Royal-cloak world spiritist!&rdquo;<br>At this moment, many of the knowledgeable people recognized that this was no ordinary spirit formation. Instead, it was a spirit formation that only royal-cloak world spiritists could set up.<br>&ldquo;That guy is actually a royal-cloak world spiritist? Why did he set up that formation? Could it be that he plans to use his spirit formation to undo the spirit formation that&rsquo;s covering the banner platform?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But&hellip; the spirit formation covering the banner platform is something a Snake Marked Royal-cloak World Spiritist set up. Even though he&rsquo;s a royal-cloak world spiritist, he is only an Insect Mark. How could he be able to undo a Snake Mark spirit formation?&rdquo; Although the crowd was surprised by Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength, there were, nevertheless, people who doubted Chu Feng.<br>They all knew that although Insect Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists and Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists were both royal-cloak world spiritists, there was an enormous difference between them. The difference was just like the gap between Martial King and Half Martial Emperor.<br>&ldquo;Huu, huu, huuu~~~&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the crowd were all speculating, Chu Feng suddenly closed his palms. His spirit formation started to spin like a golden vortex. When the spirit formation disappeared, the spirit formation that covered the banner platform also disappeared alongside it.<br>Chu Feng had managed to break apart the spirit formation!!!<br>After he broke apart the spirit formation, he did not bother with the gazes from the crowd. Instead, with a leap, he arrived on top of the banner platform and grabbed onto the banner, holding it in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Is there anyone who wishes to fight me for this banner?&rdquo; Chu Feng held the banner high and swept his gaze over the crowd below.<br>At this moment, not to mention there being people that dared to challenge him, only few among the crowd even dared to look at his gaze head-on.<br>It was as if Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze was a sharp blade capable of killing them. The majority of the people either turned their heads to the side or lowered them. They had hurried to escape his gaze.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng jumped off the platform. He returned to where Su Mei and the others were.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, where do you plan to go now?&rdquo; Lin Yezhou and the others immediately rushed over and asked with low voices.<br>Chu Feng had killed Qin Lingyun. This was an enormous crime. If Chu Feng were to return like this, it would definitely not be good.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m naturally going to return to receive my prize,&rdquo; However, Chu Feng confidently shattered their worries. Holding onto the banner, he proceeded toward the exit.<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>As the crowd watched Chu Feng&rsquo;s back, which gradually grew more and more distant, they all stood there in shock. Especially for the people who were not familiar with Chu Feng, their expressions were truly marvelous.<br>At this moment, they were uncertain whether that Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s disciple by the name of Chu Feng was a human or not.<br>However, in terms of courage, what he possessed was definitely not something that ordinary people possessed.<br>Could it be that he truly did not fear death?<br></p></div>
