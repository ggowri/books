        <h1>Chapter 3337</h1>
        <div> - The Arisal Of Bad Things<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior, right now, it&rsquo;s not only the Wuma Heavenly Clan that is confronted with a crisis; our Chu Heavenly Clan is also confronted with a crisis. We face the danger that the Li Heavenly Clan could attack us at any moment.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for me reaching the Exalted realm, we have no idea when that will happen. But right now, we do not have much time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although these cultivation resources cannot match up to the cultivation treasure snatched away by the Moon Immortal, they remain rare cultivation treasures. For us to be able to obtain these cultivation resources in the time of our clan&rsquo;s calamity is simply a favor and hope from the heavens.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the one that&rsquo;s capable of utilizing this hope is definitely not me. Instead, it is senior.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, senior, for the sake of our Chu Heavenly Clan, there&rsquo;s no time to think. Senior, you should not be thinking of me right now. Instead, you should be considering the future of our Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had a difficult expression on his face.<br>On the one hand, what Chu Feng said was very correct. Their Chu Heavenly Clan was indeed confronted with a calamity, and needed someone to contend against the Li Heavenly Clan. As for those cultivation resources, they might be the only opportunity they had.<br>On the other hand, those cultivation resources were simply too precious.<br>He had cultivated for many years in order to reach rank five Exalted. However, those cultivation resources were actually capable of allowing him to advance his cultivation by leaps and bounds in a short period of time, to possibly reach rank eight or even peak Exalted.<br>Exactly how precious were those cultivation resources?<br>Those cultivation resources were most definitely capable of giving rise to a bloody battle over them.<br>Fortunately, those experts from the various powers did not know that those cultivation resources were that powerful. Otherwise&hellip; even if Chu Feng was backed by an Exalted-level expert, those people would likely not be willing to let him get away with them.<br>Cultivation resources like those were simply things that could only be encountered by luck, and not sought after. Perhaps the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would only encounter this sort of cultivation resource once in his entire life.<br>Suddenly, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief heaved a deep sigh. He had made his decision.<br>With a wave of his sleeve, he retrieved all of the cultivation resources into his Cosmos Sack.<br>&ldquo;I truly never would&rsquo;ve expected that this old man would be granted such an opportunity by a later generation of my clan,&rdquo; although he had accepted the cultivation resources, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had a very ashamed expression on his face.<br>After all&hellip; those cultivation resources were not things that he had obtained himself. Instead, they were obtained by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, actually, this journey has not been completely in vain for me either. That Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant was extremely mysterious, and contained martial comprehension left behind by experts of the Ancient Era all over it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once this junior returns to the clan, I plan to enter closed-door training. Perhaps I might even be able to make a breakthrough to rank six Martial Immortal,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve actually managed to gain sufficient comprehension to attempt to make a breakthrough to rank six Martial Immortal by yourself, without foreign assistance, in such a short period of time?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief revealed a joyous look.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve managed to gain the comprehension all by myself. It&rsquo;s really that I&rsquo;ve gained a truly great harvest from that Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Alas, Chu Feng, you don&rsquo;t have to act so modestly. It&rsquo;s not normal for people to obtain enough comprehension to make a breakthrough just by entering an Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant. You must know that you have only become a rank five Martial Immortal not long ago.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boy, you have perfectly inherited your grandfather and father&rsquo;s talent. I truly never would&rsquo;ve imagined for the heavens to give our Chu Heavenly Clan three such heaven-defying cultivation geniuses in succession. Truly, the heavens are showing grace upon our Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was very excited, and unable to keep himself from exclaiming emotionally.<br>Although the matter regarding the Wuma Heavenly Clan had caused the Chu Heavenly Clan to feel very downcast, his mood had grown much better now.<br>Not only had Chu Feng given him hope for the future, but he had also shown him a hope for the present.<br>After they returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan, another joyous matter awaited them.<br>The effect of the Bloodline Cultivation Formations activated by Chu Feng was simply superb. In merely a short period of days, everyone had managed to benefit greatly from being inside them.<br>There were even people that managed to make a breakthrough in their long-stagnant cultivation.<br>After learning about this matter, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief felt even more joyous.<br>The Bloodline Cultivation Formations were capable of advancing the cultivations of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s peak experts. Looking at it in a long-term manner, this would allow the Chu Heavenly Clan to flourish more and more.<br>As for Chu Feng, he had shown the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief hope for the future.<br>Thus, even though the crisis of the Li Heavenly Clan was still present, Chu Feng had managed to neutralize over half of it already.<br>The appearance of the Moon Immortal had caused the Li Heavenly Clan to feel restraining fear against the Chu Heavenly Clan. Even if they were to be truly daring enough to attack the Chu Heavenly Clan with the threat of the Moon Immortal, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would not be afraid of them either.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had given him another pleasant surprise, the cultivation resources he brought back from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant.<br>Those cultivation resources were capable of allowing him to increase his cultivation by leaps and bounds in a short period of time.<br>With all of this, the future of the Chu Heavenly Clan was extremely optimistic. Whilst the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would not dare to be certain about other matters, he was certain that their Chu Heavenly Clan would definitely become one of the Ten Great Heavenly Clans sooner or later.<br>Most importantly, regardless of whether it might be the Bloodline Cultivation Formations or those cultivation resources, they were all things obtained by Chu Feng.<br>Because of this, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had enormous faith in Chu Feng. He even felt that Chu Feng would be able to surpass Chu Xuanyuan.<br>Although Chu Xuanyuan was very powerful, he had flourished too brightly too soon, and was caught as a thorn by the Starfield Master Realm early on.<br>As for Chu Feng, he was different. The speed of his growth was much slower than Chu Xuanyuan's. Yet, his growth was equally enormous. Generally, it was people like Chu Feng that posed the greatest threat.<br>That said, whilst the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was filled with confidence, and felt that Chu Feng would one day lead their Chu Heavenly Clan to unprecedented heights, he had no idea that there was a very detrimental matter toward Chu Feng being plotted within their Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Inside a very ancient palace of the Chu Heavenly Clan. That palace was a forbidden area. Generally, no one would go there.<br>However, at that moment, there were over a dozen very influential individuals of the Chu Heavenly Clan meeting secretly in that forbidden area.<br>Two among them were even the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elders.<br>One was Chu Hanqing.<br>Due to some conflicts from the past, Chu Hanqing deeply detested Chu Xuanyuan and, subsequently, Chu Feng.<br>The other Supreme Elder was named Chu Hanyouyou.<br>Chu Hanyouyou was an aged old lady. She was the only female among the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s nine Supreme Elders.<br>Chu Hanyouyou&rsquo;s many daughters had all died in various military campaigns. She only had a single grandson that was still living. She pampered that grandson of hers like a treasure. If anyone dared to provoke her grandson, she would spare no effort in taking care of that person. Even fellow clansmen were no exception.<br>Because of that, her grandson was spoiled to the point where he was a tyrant, and had done all sorts of misdeeds in the clan.<br>Although they were of the same generation, Chu Hanyouyou was a bit younger than Chu Hanxian, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Chu Hanpeng and Chu Hanqing. Thus, she could be said to be the youngest of their generation.<br>However, her grandson was over a dozen years older than Chu Hanxian&rsquo;s son, Chu Xuanyuan.<br>Back then, her son had committed a crime, and was captured by Chu Xuanyuan. However, instead of admitting his mistake, he provoked Chu Xuanyuan and ended up having his soul destroyed through a palm strike by Chu Xuanyuan, killing him.<br>Because of that, Chu Hanyouyou possessed enormous hatred for Chu Xuanyuan. When Chu Xuanyuan and Chu Feng were expelled from the Chu Heavenly Clan and imprisoned in their forbidden area, that Chu Hanyouyou contributed enormously to the cause.<br>Apart from Chu Hanqing and Chu Hanyouyou, the others present were all people of the older generation too. All of them had a single common ground. That is, they all detested Chu Xuanyuan.<br>They were all ministers that had contributed greatly to Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s banishment and imprisonment.<br>And at that moment, that group of people had gathered together. Naturally, it was not for something good.<br></p></div>
