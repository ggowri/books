        <div> - Need Help?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng felt as if he had arrived in a different world after entering the dark black gate.<br>The world was pitch-black. There was no light at all.<br>The mountain ranges were black. The flowing waters were black. The earth was also black. Even the sky was black.<br>Not a single blade of grass or tree could be seen.<br>Even the word &lsquo;desolate&rsquo; would not be enough to describe the world inside the gate. It was so desolate that it had reached a bizarre level.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, countless blood-colored lights appeared in the pitch-black world.<br>In uniform, they rushed toward Chu Feng.<br>It turned out that it wasn&rsquo;t that the place didn&rsquo;t have any creatures. On the contrary, there were a lot of creatures.<br>It was just that those creatures were all spirit formation beasts.<br>From a glance, an endless amount of spirit formation beasts could be seen. They were up in the air, standing on the ground, inside the water and deep beneath the earth. Spirit formation beasts were everywhere.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s arrival was akin to a giant boulder landing in a tranquil lake. He had immediately created an enormous commotion.<br>&ldquo;Roar---&rdquo;<br>Terrifying, ear-piercing roars sounded from all over.<br>Like a bee colony, the spirit formation beasts swarmed Chu Feng from all directions.<br>Those spirit formation beasts were each over a hundred meters tall. Such a vast swarm of giant creatures was truly terrifying to behold.<br>Before such an attack, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body appeared extremely small.<br>However, Chu Feng was not afraid. He didn&rsquo;t even cower. Instead, he continued to proceed further into the pitch black world.<br>From the moment that Chu Feng had entered the pitch black world, his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes had been activated.<br>He had discovered that there was a spirit formation core within the strange black world.<br>The formation core was very important. All the spirit formation beasts there had been created by the formation core. Even the pitch black world itself had been created by the formation core.<br>Naturally, the sensation that caused Chu Feng to tremble had also come from the formation core.<br>Chu Feng felt that if Zhuge Yuankong had truly left treasures behind, they would most definitely be hidden within the formation core.<br>The location of the formation core had been locked onto by Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>As for the incoming spirit formation beasts, Chu Feng merely waved his hand, and all of them were obliterated.<br>Unfortunately, that place was simply packed full with an endless amount of spirit formation beasts.<br>In the beginning, those spirit formation beasts were effortlessly eliminated by Chu Feng. But, later on, Utmost Exalted-level spirit formation beasts actually appeared.<br>After that came rank two Utmost Exalted-level spirit formation beasts.<br>And after that came rank three Utmost Exalted-level spirit formation beasts.<br>This made Chu Feng realize that he might very possibly not be able to reach the location of the formation core if he continued on like that. Instead, he would be attacked by even more powerful spirit formation beasts.<br>What made Chu Feng feel helpless was the fact that he had already attempted to conceal himself with a concealment formation.<br>Unfortunately, it was ineffective. Those spirit formation beasts acted as if they had locked onto his position. He was unable to avoid them, and unable to conceal himself.<br>&ldquo;It would seem that I cannot proceed further. I must think of another way,&rdquo; Chu Feng was forced to stop proceeding further.<br>Whilst he was not afraid of rank three Utmost Exalted and rank four Utmost Exalted, and could even fight against rank five Utmost Exalted, what about rank six Utmost Exalted?<br>Chu Feng was very far from the formation core.<br>Chu Feng suspected that ahead of him would not only be rank six Utmost Exalteds, but even rank seven and rank eight Utmost Exalteds. Even having peak Utmost Exalted could be possible.<br>Trying to charge through using brute force was simply impossible for Chu Feng. He would only be throwing his life away.<br>&ldquo;Bang---&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bang---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, rumbles sounded. The earth shook violently with every rumble.<br>Looking toward the source of the rumbles, Chu Feng saw ten spirit formation beasts.<br>Each of them were tens of thousands of meters tall. They were like mobile mountains that stood between heaven and earth. With great roars, those mountains walked toward Chu Feng.<br>The auras emitted by those spirit formation beasts were those of rank four Utmost Exalted.<br>But, Chu Feng had clearly stopped moving forward.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that they&rsquo;ll come at me even if I decide to stop going further?&rdquo;<br>When this thought crossed Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind, he did not resign himself to fate.<br>He immediately set up a spirit formation.<br>Soon, ten giant spirit formation swords appeared in the sky.<br>Those spirit formation swords were each a hundred meters long. Emitting bright light, they illuminated the pitch-black world.<br>Those ten swords flew toward the ten rank four Utmost Exalted-level spirit formation beasts.<br>Whilst the size of the swords could not compare to the spirit formation beasts, they were extremely powerful.<br>The spirit formation beasts were simply unable to resist them.<br>Not only were they all destroyed in an instant, but the ten spirit formation swords also turned into ten guardians that surrounded Chu Feng, protecting him.<br>Whenever a spirit formation beast dared approach Chu Feng, the spirit formation swords would immediately eliminate them.<br>&ldquo;Roar---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a roar sounded far in the distance. That roar caused the surroundings to undergo a massive change.<br>The might of the roar caused not only the sky and the earth to tremble, it also violently shook even space itself.<br>Chu Feng looked over with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes. He saw several figures over ten thousand meters in height in the distance.<br>Even though they were still very far away, Chu Feng was able to determine that they were rank five Utmost Exalted-level spirit formation beasts.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, even if I don&rsquo;t proceed further, they&rsquo;ll come to attack me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is simply not a place that one can breach,&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed a deep frown.<br>The Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk was not reacting at all.<br>Chu Feng was unable to obtain any assistance from it.<br>Even if he were able to defeat the incoming rank five Utmost Exalted-level spirit formation beasts with his martial abilities, what if rank six Utmost Exalted-level spirit formation beasts appeared afterwards?<br>How was Chu Feng supposed to fight them?<br>Even though he was very unwilling, Chu Feng turned around. He intended to leave this.<br>&ldquo;Boy, it seems like you need help.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a woman&rsquo;s voice entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>Hearing that voice, Chu Feng was immediately overjoyed.<br>He couldn&rsquo;t possibly forget that voice.<br>It was the Divine Deer&rsquo;s voice.<br>The Divine Deer had come from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Secret Skill that Chu Feng had obtained from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s race, the Galewind Hunting Clan.<br>Chu Feng had no idea exactly what sort of existence the Divine Deer was. He also didn&rsquo;t know exactly how powerful it was.<br>But, Chu Feng knew that the Divine Deer was enormously fast.<br>When Chu Feng had been chased by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms in Mount Ivory Valley, it was the Divine Deer that had saved him.<br>The speed of the Divine Deer was the fastest that Chu Feng had ever seen.<br>If it were willing to aid him, he might be able to continue penetrating the dark black world.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you&rsquo;ve finally reappeared.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This junior wants to penetrate deep into this place. Senior, are you able to help me?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was wild with joy. Yet, he was also slightly worried.<br>The Divine Deer was a very mysterious existence. It also had a very eccentric temperament. When Chu Feng had encountered danger in the past, he had sought its help, but had been unable to receive a response.<br>Even though the Divine Deer had spoken to him of its own accord this time around, Chu Feng was still uncertain if it was willing to help him.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, light began circulating through Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>Not only was the light incomparably divine, it also began to transform. Soon, the light took the shape of an incomparably divine deer.<br>Chu Feng immediately mounted the deer.<br>&ldquo;This place has an extraordinary power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although you are simply unable to handle that power, this Divine Deer is very curious as to exactly what that power is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boy, go and have a look for this Divine Deer. Check out exactly what is hidden deep in this place,&rdquo; said the Divine Deer.<br>&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; Chu Feng answered without hesitation.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng answered, the Divine Deer began moving on its own. With rapid speed, it started flying into the depths of the dark black world.<br>The Divine Deer was extremely fast. Those spirit formation beasts were simply unable to even reach Chu Feng. Just like that, they were left far in the dust.<br>Even though this was Chu Feng&rsquo;s second time experiencing the power of the Divine Deer, he was still extremely shocked.<br>Who could possibly stop this sort of speed?<br>Whilst Chu Feng was delighted by the Divine Deer revealing itself to aid him, he was unable to keep himself from wondering exactly what sort of power was hidden within the formation core that would be able to interest even the mysterious and powerful Divine Deer?<br></p></div>
