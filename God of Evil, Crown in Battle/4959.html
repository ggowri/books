        <h1>Chapter 4958</h1>
        <div>: The One Who Blocks the Way<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve succeeded!&rdquo;<br>Princess Xiaoxiao walked up to Chu Feng with an excited look on her face. Even though the crowd had already mostly figured out what was going on, most of them were still waiting for Chu Feng to affirm their guesses.<br>&ldquo;Mmhm. However, I wasn&rsquo;t able to reach rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation, presumably due to the limitation of my talent. It looks like this is my limit,&rdquo; Chu Feng said shamefully.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you need not be so humble. Many juniors of our Zhuge Clan have entered the legacy formation, but none of them has been able to obtain it. Yet, you managed to do it within less than fifteen minutes after entering the legacy formation. That shows that your talent far surpasses that of others. As for reaching rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation, that is nothing but a rumor,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;My apologies, elder. This formation was something Lord Situ Qi left for your Zhuge Clan, but I ended up claiming it for my own. I will repay this debt to you in the future,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I take those words as a personal insult. If not for the helping hand you have offered us, we would have been obliterated. What does a mere legacy formation compare to that? Besides, Lord Situ Qi has also said that only the capable is worthy of inheriting the legacy formation.<br>&ldquo;In truth, our Zhuge Clan has already prepared ourselves to leave this land. It&rsquo;s just that transporting the legacy formation is rather troublesome, but we can&rsquo;t bear to just leave it here. Your arrival has solved our dilemma, so we can leave with ease of mind now,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, it sounds like you&rsquo;re aware that those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan are coming from you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;Yes. A month ago, someone tipped us off that the Situ World Spiritist Clan might be knocking on our doors in the near future and advised us to leave this place as soon as possible,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;A month ago? Who is it?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s interest was piqued.<br>Shengguang Baimei, Daoist Niantian, and the others also looked at the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief intently, interested to know who was the one who managed to discern the intent of the Situ World Spiritist Clan beforehand.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know either, but the letter contains reasons which left us with no choice but to believe in its authenticity. It isn&rsquo;t convenient for me to divulge those reasons, so I have to ask for your understanding,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t blame the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief for withholding information from him. He might have saved the Zhuge Clan, but he wasn&rsquo;t so arrogant as to demand the Zhuge Clan to bend their back over toward him for that.<br>In any case, the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief must have his own reasons for not talking about it.<br>&ldquo;When are you planning to leave this place?&rdquo; Master Yin Ren suddenly asked.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re planning to leave right now,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief replied.<br>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t the Zhuge Clan still have many other major formations here?&rdquo; Master Yin Ren asked.<br>&ldquo;Those are nothing more than worldly possessions,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief replied.<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re intending to leave, why don&rsquo;t you lend your Soulhealing Formation to me?&rdquo; Master Yin Ren asked.<br>&ldquo;Oh? What are you planning to do with it?&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>Instead of answering the question, Master Yin Ren turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, even though you have obtained the legacy, you&rsquo;re only at rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation at the moment. Even if you are able to raise your spirit power up to a level comparable to rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation with your means, that still doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have reached that level. Under normal circumstances, it&rsquo;s impossible for you to save Princess Miaomiao. However, if we could use the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Soulhealing Formation, there might just be a way to pull it off.&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing those words, Chu Feng turned to the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and asked, &ldquo;Elder, could we borrow your Soulhealing Formation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to be so courteous. We&rsquo;re already planning to leave this place, so young friend Chu Feng, feel free to use whatever you want to.&rdquo;<br>The Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief tossed a formation key and a map of the area to Chu Feng. They talked for a while longer before the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief departed from the area together with his clan members.<br>In just a few moments, the only ones left in the vast territory of the Zhuge Clan were Chu Feng and his group. The buildings were still standing tall and mighty, but there was an air of bleak emptiness looming around.<br>Using the map that he received, Chu Feng was able to quickly find the Soulhealing Formation.<br>According to Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s explanation, the Soulhealing Formation was constructed by Zhuge Guangyao. It was a formation to heal one&rsquo;s soul, but it had the power of enhancing a person&rsquo;s soul power too.<br>That wouldn&rsquo;t have been useful under most circumstances, but it was an invaluable aid in helping them extract Xian Miaomiao from Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s body. It was just that they required certain means to put it to good use.<br>Master Yin Ren provided a formation blueprint and worked together with Daoist Niantian, Shengguang Buyu, and Shenggaung Baimei to make some preparations on top of the Soulhealing Formation.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng and Princess Xiaoxiao entered the formation and waited inside.<br>Once the preparations were ready, Shengguang Buyu, Shengguang Baimei, and Daoist Niantian would be working in unison to activate the Soulhealing Formation. Through the powers of the Soulhealing Formation, they should be able to extract Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s soul from Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s body.<br>Just constructing the formation was quite a lengthy process.<br>&hellip;<br>Meanwhile, those from the Zhuge Clan had left their homeland. To ensure that no one would learn of their whereabouts, they made sure to take a detour toward a slightly further ancient teleportation formation.<br>If they left through this ancient teleportation formation, they would be able to avoid leaving any trails which pursuers could use to track them down.<br>They had managed to avert a calamity, but most of them had awful complexions, especially the juniors. Most of them were sobbing uncontrollably.<br>After all, they were permanently leaving a place where they had called home for many years. It was inevitable that they would get emotional about it.<br>&ldquo;What are you crying for? As long as we&rsquo;re alive, we can easily make a new home for ourselves. We have already survived the worst; all that we&rsquo;re doing now is moving places. So what are all of you crying for? Don&rsquo;t you find it embarrassing? Anyone who continues to cry can get lost!&rdquo; a bellow echoed.<br>The juniors immediately zipped up their mouths, not daring to even let loose a whimper. They wouldn&rsquo;t dare to defy the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;How scary, Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief,&rdquo; an aged voice suddenly echoed out of nowhere.<br>The crowd quickly turned their eyes over, only to pale in the next moment. All of the elders quickly stepped out of their respective floating warships. Even the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief also stepped out as well.<br>The entire Zhuge Clan was prepared for battle.<br>A person had just appeared in the path of the Zhuge Clan.<br></p></div>
