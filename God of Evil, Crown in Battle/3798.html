        <div> - A Forced Marriage?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Asura.&rdquo;<br>Song Ge suddenly called out to Chu Feng enroute.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. I am merely calling out to you.&rdquo;<br>Song Ge shook her head. However, her little face was smiling brilliantly.<br>She sighed. &ldquo;This is simply like a dream.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Song Ge moved her head to the side and her face upward. Even her footsteps became somewhat mischievous.<br>&ldquo;Girl, what is wrong with you?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I already knew that you were very powerful. However, never did I imagine you to be this powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster and the others must address you as senior respectfully. Yet, I am able to address you by name. I truly feel like I am even more amazing than the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster and those other grand characters," Song Ge said proudly.<br>&ldquo;You will become more amazing than all of them in the future,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to comfort me. I know very well how capable I am,&rdquo; said Song Ge.<br>&ldquo;What I said is the truth," Chu Feng spoke with great determination.<br>After all, Song Ge was Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s daughter. Her own talent had also been fully revealed. She had inherited Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s talent.<br>&ldquo;Forget it. You really don&rsquo;t have to comfort me. Although I am incompetent, I am already very content to be able to know you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, Asura, where do you live? Can you give me your address?&rdquo; asked Song Ge.<br>&ldquo;I am not from here. I am merely passing by this place. Soon, I will be leaving again. Thus, you don&rsquo;t have to search for me. If the opportunity presents itself in the future, I will come see you," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Very well. That said, Asura, I am truly sorry, but I have some things that I need to take care of. Thus, I might have to leave first.&rdquo; Song Ge had a face filled with reluctance as she said those words.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. Go ahead and do what you need to do.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Are you free in two days&rsquo; time?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Song Ge replied immediately.<br>&ldquo;In that case, go to your Void Cleanse Monastery&rsquo;s Fate-changing Bell in two days and wait for me. I need you for something,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;The Fate-changing Bell? Why must I go to the Fate-changing Bell? Wouldn&rsquo;t other places be fine?&rdquo; asked Song Ge.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Are you unwilling to go to the Fate-changing Bell?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Even though Song Ge did not expressly display her reluctance, Chu Feng was able to determine from her reaction that she did not wish to go to the Fate-changing Bell.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. You&rsquo;re going to find me in the Void Cleanse Monastery? That would truly be great.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well, I will see you at the Fate-changing Bell in two days,&rdquo; said Song Ge.<br>Then, Song Ge left. Chu Feng did not journey with her. Instead, he secretly followed her.<br>To Chu Feng&rsquo;s surprise, after Song Ge parted with him, her joyous expression was soon replaced with a worried frown. Grief filled her face.<br>The grief she expressed was not from parting ways with Chu Feng. Instead, it was due to something else.<br>Furthermore, Song Ge also did not return to the Void Cleanse Monastery. Instead, she returned to Autumnfall Village.<br>She returned to her home.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng came to a sudden realization.<br>It turned out that Song Ge had already learned that her mother was terminally ill, and would not be able to live for much longer.<br>Song Ge wanted to spend as much time with her mother as she possibly could. Even when she'd went to the city earlier, she had only done so to purchase some things that her mother liked.<br>The scene of Song Ge accompanying her mother was also completely witnessed by Old Freak Tang.<br>Chu Feng arrived at the smithy and found Old Freak Tang.<br>At that moment, Old Freak Tang seemed to have a dying flash, and appeared particularly spirited.<br>He was even smiling as he looked at Song Ge and her mother.<br>It was as if he was also standing there and having a reunion with them.<br>&ldquo;Senior, why must you wait two more days? Why don&rsquo;t you go and meet Song Ge now? Isn&rsquo;t it better for your family to reunite sooner?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt that since Old Freak Tang and Song Ge&rsquo;s mother were both going to die soon, it would be better for them to be reunited sooner, and make up for the regrets of the past.<br>&ldquo;Two days is a short period of time that will pass very quickly." Old Freak Tang smiled. Then, he looked to Chu Feng with a look of appreciation.<br>&ldquo;Senior, why are you looking at me like that?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt extremely uncomfortable being looked at with such a gaze.<br>&ldquo;Did you know why I cursed you that day?&rdquo; asked Old Freak Tang.<br>&ldquo;Did senior not do that to warn this junior?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. That curse of mine had a testing effect. After being cursed, you entered a semi-conscious state. During that period of time, I did some tests on you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After testing you, I&rsquo;ve discovered that you, brat, truly possess a good moral character,&rdquo; said Old Freak Tang.<br>&ldquo;No wonder I felt like someone was questioning me when I was unconscious. Strangely, I was conversing with that person, yet do not remember anything I said, and also have no idea what that person said to me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Turns out, the person conversing with me was actually you, senior.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng came to a sudden realization.<br>&ldquo;Haha. Of course it was me.&rdquo;<br>Old Freak Tang burst into loud laughter.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, my daughter is pretty decent, no?&rdquo; Old Freak Tang asked.<br>&ldquo;She is pretty decent," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Then what do you think about taking her as your wife?&rdquo; asked Old Freak Tang.<br>&ldquo;Ah? Senior, that wouldn&rsquo;t do, no?&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? You don&rsquo;t fancy my daughter, don&rsquo;t think that she&rsquo;s a match for you?&rdquo; asked Old Freak Tang.<br>&ldquo;Senior, that is not this junior&rsquo;s implication at all. Song Ge is a very good woman. She is also very outstanding. However, I&rsquo;ve only considered her a friend and have never had that sort of feeling for her,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Feelings are things that can be nurtured with time," said Old Freak Tang.<br>&ldquo;Senior, for some feelings, they are determined the moment people meet. They are very difficult to nurture," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;If you are to marry my daughter, I will teach you the curse techniques that you wish to know.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Trust me. No matter what sort of curse your friend might be inflicted with, as long as you learn my curse techniques, you will be able to lift that curse.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should also be able to tell that I am going to die soon. I am unable to personally go and lift the curse on your friend. Furthermore, I also do not have a successor to my techniques.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The best method would be for you to personally learn my curse techniques and lift your friend&rsquo;s curse on your own,&rdquo; Old Freak Tang said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this sort of thing cannot be forced,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re refusing? In that case, you can scram, the farther the better. Before my death, I will destroy my curse techniques. Don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;ll be able to gain them after my death.&rdquo; Old Freak Tang turned hostile faster than the flip of a book&rsquo;s page.<br>&ldquo;Senior, although I am unable to marry Song Ge, I am&hellip; able to take Song Ge as my older sister," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Take your grandma and fuck off! Scram immediately!&rdquo;<br>Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s face turned purple with anger. Then, he waved his sleeve and unleashed his oppressive might.<br>He actually used his oppressive might to force Chu Feng out of his smithy.<br></p></div>
