        <div>: Warmth in the Heart<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pained look on Zi Ling&rsquo;s face slowly alleviated, and her cheeks began to regain their healthy glow. Some kind of power appeared to be nourishing her body. Judging from her reaction, it was apparent that her suffering had finally come to an end.<br>Chu Feng was relieved to see that Zi Ling was doing well now, and his heart was set at ease. However, he couldn&rsquo;t help but turn his sights toward the now unconscious Song Yun.<br>Song Yun was safe for now, but her condition wasn&rsquo;t too optimistic. She was in a feeble state.<br>He was angry that Song Yun had tried to harm Zi Ling, but he still considered Song Yun a friend of his. Putting aside how she treated the others, there was no denying that she had helped him greatly in the past.<br>He felt uncomfortable and guilt-ridden seeing Song Yun&rsquo;s current state. To look at it from another perspective, this had happened to her due to Zi Ling.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly heard Zi Ling&rsquo;s voice.<br>Chu Feng turned around and saw that Zi Ling was still deep in her cultivation, but the voice transmission had definitely come from her. She was being discreet about this because Chu Xuanyuan had reminded her not to tell anyone about the existence of the Blood-red Ancient Tower, so she only told Chu Feng about it.<br>Even the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster was kept in the dark. She thought that Zi Ling was just afflicted with some kind of mysterious illness.<br>It was not that Zi Ling didn&rsquo;t trust the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, but this was simply a promise she had made with Chu Xuanyuan.<br>Thus, even though she was already done cultivating, she continued to put on an act so as to tell Chu Feng about the current situation with the Blood-red Ancient Tower.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Zi Ling?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied via voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, a slit has appeared in the first door of the Blood-red Ancient Tower. I can feel something, and my instincts are telling me that the door will open if I can comprehend it. The elder hasn&rsquo;t said anything, but I sense that the elder wouldn&rsquo;t make things hard for me anymore as long as I can open the door. She might even offer me help.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m unable to comprehend it yet,&rdquo; Zi Ling said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if I can help you later on,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll get up first.&rdquo;<br>Zi Ling finally opened her eyes and rose to her feet. The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster immediately rushed forward to ask about her condition.<br>Zi Ling neglected to mention anything about the Blood-red Ancient Tower, only saying that her illness had alleviated and that she had received something good out of it. She said that there was a power lying dormant in her, and her cultivation could advance significantly if she could tap into it properly.<br>The power was naturally referring to the Blood-red Ancient Tower, just that it wasn&rsquo;t convenient for her to go into details.<br>The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster wasn&rsquo;t too concerned about the power too. What was important to her was Zi Ling&rsquo;s safety. It was a good thing if Zi Ling could receive additional benefits out of that, but that was of secondary concern.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s return then,&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster said.<br>The joy on Zi Ling&rsquo;s face halved the moment she heard those words.<br>&ldquo;Master, may I&hellip; not return to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect first?&rdquo; Zi Ling asked.<br>She had worked hard for the sake of catching up with Chu Feng, and the notion of having to part with him pained her.<br>&ldquo;You wish to accompany Chu Feng? You need not seek my opinion about that. I have no qualms if Chu Feng is willing to take you with him,&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster said.<br>Zi Ling&rsquo;s face immediately erupted in joy. She believed that Chu Feng would agree to it.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s subsequent words made her heart sink.<br>&ldquo;Zi Ling, you should return to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect together with Lord Sectmaster first,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;But big brother Chu Feng, I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Zi Ling tried to argue with him on it, but Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind was made up.<br>&ldquo;Zi Ling, listen to me on this.&rdquo;<br>Those words put Zi Ling at a loss.<br>In truth, she was aware that Chu Feng was going to do something dangerous, and it was for her own good that he didn&rsquo;t want to involve her in it. Thus, she gave in.<br>&ldquo;You have to look for me once you&rsquo;re done settling your affairs,&rdquo; Zi Ling said with an indignant tone.<br>&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ll definitely return to your side even if you don&rsquo;t welcome me. Wait for me, alright?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng gently stroked Zi Ling&rsquo;s hair. He felt guilt-ridden seeing how she was always compromising for his sake.<br>The two of them had braved through many difficulties together, forging deep feelings between them. Yet, the time they could spend with each other was continuously decreasing. It wasn&rsquo;t easy for them to reunite with each other, but he was unable to spend much time with her due to his personal affairs.<br>He felt like he had let Zi Ling down.<br>But there was no way around it. He wouldn&rsquo;t be him if he could turn a blind eye to his friend&rsquo;s plight.<br>Following that, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster made two announcements.<br>First and foremost, she declared that she would bring Yaoyao back with her to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Regarding that, Chu Feng expressed his full approval, knowing that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect could provide the highest level of safety for Yaoyao.<br>The next announcement was directed toward the Godwish Grandmother and<br>Lady of Dao Sea. Even though the two of them attempted to harm Zi Ling, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had no intention of pursuing the matter. Instead, she gave them an opportunity to make amends.<br>She wanted them to follow Chu Feng and protect him. They would have to follow Chu Feng wherever he went till he had the strength to protect himself.<br>Naturally, the Godwish Grandmother and<br>Lady of Dao Sea accepted those instructions.<br>Chu Feng felt a surge of warmth in his heart.<br></p></div>
