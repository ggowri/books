        <div> - All Because Of Chu Feng<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, Your Highness Princess, we&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Shut it! If you dare utter another word, I&rsquo;ll tear apart your mouth!&rdquo;<br>The Flying Feather Heavenly Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster attempted to explain things. But, before he could finish saying anything, he was shouted down by Long Xiaoxiao.<br>Once Long Xiaoxiao said those words, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s guards immediately took out their weapons and aimed it at the faces of the people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect. Those weapons were right next to their mouths.<br>They seemed to be saying that they will cut off their tongues if they dared to say anymore.<br>With the situation like this, not even the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster dared to say anything anymore. Like the others from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, he had a miserable and anxious look.<br>Seeing the expression of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster, Chu Feng was unable to contain his laughter.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t call it offending me. Merely, their manner of conduct was truly vile. While I have no idea what they&rsquo;ve done in the past, they&rsquo;ve decided to bully the Ancestral Martial Dragon City today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Ancestral Martial Dragon City has shown grace to me in the past. They are my benefactors. Thus, I, Chu Feng, naturally cannot tolerate my benefactors being bullied. That&rsquo;s why we ended up having conflict,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, exactly what sort of malicious deed had they done? Is it possible for you to tell us about it?&rdquo; asked the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t bother to beat around the bush either. He directly informed them what happened.<br>Of course, there was no need for Chu Feng to add details to the story. Merely by telling the truth was enough to ignite vast killing intent in Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Long Xiaoxiao was not the only one. Even the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s eyes were overflowing with killing intent.<br>&ldquo;Utterly impudent!&rdquo;<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief shouted loudly. The surrounding air turned bone-chillingly cold.<br>Everyone could feel the chilliness emitted by the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>It was as if, as long as he willed it, the surrounding will instantly perish.<br>The people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City and Starfield Holy Land have simply never before seen such a sight. Even though this matter had to do with them, they were still utterly terrified.<br>&ldquo;As a Supreme Elder of my Dragon Clan, how could Long Yinfeng fail to distinguish right and wrong like so?! How could he help these filthy things?!<br>&ldquo;Pass my order! Long Yinfeng is to be stripped of his Supreme Elder status the moment he comes out of his closed-door training!&rdquo; loudly said the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Once he said those words, Long Daozhi and others felt even more astonished.<br>As for the people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, their faces turned even more ashen with despair.<br>Even Long Yinfeng, the person they were relying on, has been stripped of his Supreme Elder position. They were all able to imagine exactly what sort of end would come down to them, insects in the eyes of the Dragon Clan.<br>&ldquo;Father, how do you plan to punish these people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect?&rdquo; asked Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;People of the Dragon Clan, heed my command.<br>&ldquo;The Flying Feather Heavenly Sect relied on Long Yinfeng to commit outrageous acts. Their behavior has brought slander upon our Dragon Clan&rsquo;s reputation. Their punishment shall be death on the spot. Leave none alive,&rdquo; said the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Father, I think that punishment isn&rsquo;t suitable,&rdquo; said Long Xiaoxiao.<br>Hearing those words, the crowd thought that Long Xiaoxiao was planning to ask for leniency for the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect.<br>After all, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief has already sentenced the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect to death.<br>But, surprising everyone, Long Xiaoxiao said, &ldquo;The reason why these people dared to act with disregard for everything was all because they were relying on Elder Long Yinfeng&rsquo;s backing..<br>&ldquo;I believe that Elder Long Yinfeng shall be the person to take care of these people.<br>&ldquo;Thus, I think that using Elder Long Yinfeng&rsquo;s invention, the Thousand Punishments Platform, to take care of these people would be most suitable,&rdquo; said Long Xiaoxiao.<br>Hearing those words, many people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect fainted from fear.<br>As for those that didn&rsquo;t faint, they began to howl in grief and beg for forgiveness.<br>Earlier, they do not even dare to beg for forgiveness. But now, they had no choice but to do so.<br>In fact, they were not the only ones terrified. After hearing Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s suggestion, even Long Daozhi and others couldn&rsquo;t help but suck in a mouthful of cold air.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what sort of punishment is that Thousand Punishments Platform?&rdquo;<br>Curious, Chu Feng went over to Long Daozhi&rsquo;s side and quietly asked him about it.<br>Long Daozhi knew a lot about the Dragon Clan. Thus, he knew about the Thousand Punishments Platform too.<br>After hearing Long Daozhi&rsquo;s explanation, Chu Feng learned the so-called Thousand Punishments Platform was a type of punishment.<br>Those receiving the punishment will undergo a thousand different kinds of punishment in a seven day period.<br>Even if someone managed to survive the seven days and the thousand different punishments, they will still not be spared. Instead, they will be beheaded.<br>In simpler terms, the Thousand Punishments Platform was meant to give those on death roll a miserable death.<br>&ldquo;That girl is truly ruthless.&rdquo;<br>Chu Fenglooked at Long Xiaoxiao.<br>After all, it was Long Xiaoxiao who raised that proposal.<br>Truth was, Chu Feng had experienced first-hand how ruthless Long Xiaoxiao was on their first meeting. But, it just so happened that Chu Feng did not dislike her ruthlessness. On the contrary, he admires it.<br>&ldquo;Very well, let&rsquo;s do as Xiaoxiao suggested.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bring back the people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect to our Dragon Clan and imprison them for the time being. Once Elder Long Yinfeng exits his closed-door training, he shall personally carry out their punishment,&rdquo; ordered the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Plop, plop, plop---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a series of muffled explosions were heard. It was the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect&rsquo;s elders. They were committing suicide by expanding their bodies.<br>Seeing that their death were certain, they do not wish to go through a hellish torture and decided to end themselves.<br>After witnessing the suicide of some elders, the others began to imitate them. Even the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster and his younger brother Dian Kuang were planning to commit suicide.<br>Unfortunately, before they could kill themselves, a power enveloped them.<br>Enveloped by that power, they were unable to even kill themselves.<br>Turned out, that was the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s power.<br>&ldquo;Properly watch over them. Before receiving their punishment, they must be kept alive,&rdquo; ordered the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>At this moment, the anguished wailings of the people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect had reached an extreme level.<br>If one didn&rsquo;t know where those miserable screams came from, one might even think that they&rsquo;re hearing the sound of people being tortured in hell.<br>The people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect were not only begging nonstop for forgiveness from the Dragon Clan, they were even begging Chu Feng for forgiveness.<br>They all knew that their current situation was all due to them having offended Chu Feng.<br>But, Chu Feng showed no sign of mercy toward them.<br>The Flying Feather Heavenly Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster possessed an exceptionally awful moral quality and had committed all sorts of evil.<br>As for the elders and disciples, they knew how wicked their Sectmaster was yet were still wholeheartedly following him.<br>Thus, they were nothing more than jackals of the same tribe. If they were allowed to live, they will definitely continue to harm others. Their deaths were well justified.<br>It was not only Chu Feng and the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City that felt no sympathy for them, even the bystanders like the Starfield Holy Land did not feel any sympathy for them.<br>They were all enraged merely by hearing what the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect did to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City. They all felt that the people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect all deserved to die.<br>What the crowd didn&rsquo;t notice was that there were some other people feeling frightened after witnessing how the people from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect were arrested by the Dragon Clan.<br>Standing among the crowd, Wuming Doutian was repeatedly wiping away the cold sweat on his forehead.<br>He couldn&rsquo;t help but covertly examine Chu Feng with his eyes. All the while, he was wiping off his cold sweat and sighing in relief.<br>&ldquo;Fortuna, fortunately, fortunately he&rsquo;s not an enemy now.&rdquo;<br>&hellip;<br>With the arrival of such important guests, Long Daozhi would naturally not show any neglect.<br>After he invited the people from the Dragon Clan into the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, he immediately began to show the utmost amount of hospitality.<br>Truth be told, this level of hospitality was never shown by the Ancestral Martial Dragon City before. They were simply trying to present all the goods that their Ancestral Martial Dragon City possess to entertain the Dragon Clansmen.<br>But, although they were doing that, they were not feeling distressed from the wealth and resources they&rsquo;re consuming. Instead, they were extremely happy.<br>Excitement filled all the people in the Ancestral Martial Dragon City. It was a scene of joy and liveliness never before present in the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.<br>After all, returning to the Dragon Clan was something that they dreamed for generations.<br>But, whether it might be the elders of the normal clansmen, the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City were all discussing one person -- Chu Feng.<br>They all knew that it was all due to Chu Feng that they were able to return to the Dragon Clan.<br>After Chu Feng met with the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, he took out the black shadow, the picture scroll his clansmen were imprisoned in.<br>He wanted to see if any of the experts of the Dragon Clan knew the location on the picture scroll.<br>To his disappointment, even the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and numerous other experts do not recognize the location indicated by the scroll.<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was originally planning to accompany Chu Feng to pay the Chu Heavenly Clan a visit.<br>But, Chu Feng refused them.<br>He did not mention the current situation of his Chu Heavenly Clansmen. The reason for that was because he felt that the Dragon Clan would not be able to help him in that matter. He also did not wish to worry them. Thus, he decided to undertake everything himself.<br>As for the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, he was not particularly interested in the Chu Heavenly Clan anyways. The reason why he wanted to pay them a visit was all so to befriend Chu Feng.<br>Since Chu Feng refused, he didn&rsquo;t bother insisting either.<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s arrival at the Ancestral Martial Dragon City and inviting them to return to the Dragon Clan was also done to win Chu Feng&rsquo;s favor.<br>Because of that, the Dragon Clan decided to stay in the Ancestral Martial Dragon City for several days.<br>During this period of time, they&rsquo;ve classified the Ancestral Martial Dragon City as a branch of their Dragon Clan. Furthermore, Long Daozhi was to continue to manage the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.<br>During the days Chu Feng was staying in the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, a lot of his friends were accompanying him. There were no mutual deception or life and death battles. This brought relief upon his tense mood and the pressure he was shouldering.<br>Unfortunately, happy times were always be short-lived.<br>Judging from the timing of things, the tournament for juniors held by the Holy Light Clan was about to begin.<br>Ignoring the fact that Chu Feng wanted to prove himself and win honor for the Chu Heavenly Clan, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t want to miss out on the prize the Holy Light Clan prepared for the victor of the tournament.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng would not allow himself to miss this first tournament no matter what happens.<br>Not only did he need to obtain the Holy Light Bloodline Essence, Chu Feng also had to make the people from the Holy Light Galaxy remember his name.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng set off for the tournament with the Dragon Clan.<br>Long Daozhi, Wuming Doutian, Long NIng, Kong Tianhui and many other friends of Chu Feng also accompanied him.<br>They&rsquo;ve actually heard about this tournament for juniors too.<br>It was just that a grand occasion like that was something too far from their reach. None of them had ever thought about going to spectate the tournament.<br>But, things were different now...<br>They now knew of Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength. They wanted to witness for themselves how Chu Feng would display his brilliance on the stage known as the entire Holy Light Galaxy!<br></p></div>
