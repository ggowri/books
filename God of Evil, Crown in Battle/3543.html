        <h1>Chapter 3542</h1>
        <div> - The Undead And Wang Qiang<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;The appearance of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen most definitely means an enormous conspiracy is at hand. Everyone, we must be extra careful. It is best that we do not split up,&rdquo; said the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Right. It is better that we stay together,&rdquo; The crowd nodded in succession.<br>After personally witnessing the might of a Blood-devouring Demon Clansman, they were already terrified.<br>There were only two peak Exalted-level individuals amongst the vast crowd. One was the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder, Tantai Yinjian. As for the other, he was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Evidently, the two of them were the strongest guardians among all the people present.<br>And now, one of those two peak Exalted experts was with them. It was only natural that they would not be willing to part with him. To be exact, they would refuse to leave the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s side even if they were to be beaten to death.<br>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief turned his eyes to the golden fruit.<br>&ldquo;It seems like we will have to spend a lot of effort in order to obtain this fruit. We cannot continue to waste our time here.&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief began to walk towards the golden fruit.<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...<br>Time passed. Chu Feng had been trapped in the illusion for over a dozen days.<br>The scene of the illusion did not change in the slightest. However, Chu Feng became extremely weak, so much so that his life was in danger.<br>That said, even with that being the case, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes were still burning like a torch. He was trying his best to keep his cool, and still search for a way to breach the illusion.<br>What Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know was that what was happening inside the illusion was being witnessed clearly at a certain place.<br>That place seemed like a palace hall. However, it would be somewhat rough to call it a palace hall, as the surroundings were all composed of trees. It would be more accurate to call it an enormous tree cave.<br>There was a small lake in the center of the tree cave. The surface of the lake was very calm. However, Chu Feng's situation was being displayed in the center of the lake.<br>There were two people on the shore of the lake looking at the image before them.<br>Of them, one was watching the scene very earnestly, seemingly unable to take his eyes off the lake.<br>Although that individual had a humanoid figure, he did not look like a human. Instead, he looked more like a monster.<br>His entire body was covered in white bandages, that were themselves covered in bloodstains. Only a pair of very lifeless eyes could be seen. However, those eyes appeared very terrifying. It was impossible to determine what was terrifying about that individual&rsquo;s eyes. Merely, upon seeing those eyes, one would tremble with fear.<br>Normally, being wrapped in blood-stained bandages would make one appear to be seriously injured, and would not make one be described as a "monster."<br>The reason why that individual resembled a monster was because there was a green light being emitted from his body. Furthermore, one could continuously smell a rotten odor from him.<br>His appearance simply did not resemble that of a person. Instead, he looked more like a corpse, a living corpse.<br>To be exact, he should be undead.<br>As for the other person present, he was very normal. At the very least&hellip; he appeared to be alive.<br>Normally, if one were a normal living person, even if one were not afraid, one would still keep a distance should there be an undead emitting a rotten odor from head to toe beside them.<br>However, that person not only did not keep his distance, but he was also standing there and eating green fruits by the mouthful.<br>Those were all Sacred Tree Fruits!!!<br>Precious Sacred Tree Fruits were actually piled up into a little hill several tens of meters tall beside him.<br>He was eating those precious Sacred Tree Fruits like seeds - one down with every bite.<br>Perhaps he was enjoying the fruits too much, but he was merely taking a couple glances at the scene on the surface of the lake, and placing the majority of his attention on eating more fruits.<br>One thing worthy of mentioning was that that person was&hellip; the same person Chu Feng and the others had encountered earlier.<br>He was that man who possessed an identical look to Wang Qiang, yet was wearing tree bark armor.<br>&ldquo;Hey hey hey, say, little brat, didn&rsquo;t you say that this is your good brother? He&rsquo;s on the verge of collapse, yet you&rsquo;re not even bothering to look at him. Are you not afraid that he&rsquo;ll die?&rdquo; the undead man as he looked to the man who looked exactly like Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;I-i-it&rsquo;s pre-precisely be-because he&rsquo;s my b-bro-brother that I&rsquo;m n-not looking,&rdquo; said that man. This time around, the way he spoke was exactly the same as the way Wang Qiang would normally speak.<br>&ldquo;So you two are fake brothers?&rdquo; the undead man asked.<br>&ldquo;W-what do y-you mean by f-fake brothers? T-the two of us a-are close b-brothers who h-ha-have gone t-through life a-and death together,&rdquo; Wang Qiang cast a side eye at the undead man.<br>&ldquo;Brothers that have gone through life and death together?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, why don&rsquo;t I see you, little brat, showing concern for him?&rdquo; The undead man did not believe that Wang Qiang had a deep relationship with Chu Feng due to the way he was acting.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s b-because he-he&rsquo;s my go-good brother that I-I-I know t-that i-ill-illusion will not be-be able to baffle him,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite confident in him,&rdquo; said the undead man.<br>&ldquo;G-go on a-and continue w-watching. I-I know best how s-strong my brother is,&rdquo; Wang Qiang spoke confidently.<br>Hearing those words, the undead man&rsquo;s gaze changed somewhat. Then, he looked back to the lake.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. That little brat is quite capable. He&rsquo;s actually able to maintain his calm the entire time, even in that sort of situation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With how confident he is, what he lacks is merely a bit of luck. After all, he has passed by the exit many times. All he lacks is touching the exit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, if he is to continue, he will sooner or later be able to escape from the illusion formation,&rdquo; said the Living Dead.<br>&ldquo;Well d-d-duh! He-he&rsquo;s my b-brother, okay?&rdquo; Wang Qiang spoke proudly.<br>&ldquo;Strange!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the undead man who was sitting on the ground stood up abruptly.<br>A shocked expression appeared in his previously lifeless eyes.<br>&ldquo;O-old fart, w-what&rsquo;s w-wrong? Why a-are you so sh-shocked?&rdquo; Wang Qiang rolled his eyes at the undead man.<br>&ldquo;That brat is stealing my fruits!!!&rdquo; the undead man said.<br>&ldquo;S-st-stealing your f-fr-frui-fruits? Old fart, what d-do you m-mean by that?&rdquo; Wang Qiang also stood up upon hearing those words. He looked to the surface of the lake with curiosity.<br>&ldquo;The source of the illusory formation comes from the power of thirty-six golden fruits. Combined with the power of the Void Sacred Tree, the illusory formation becomes something that not even world spirit techniques could see through.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Logically, if that brat wanted to breach the illusory formation, he would merely need to find the exit. However&hellip; he has passed by the exit many times, yet he has not touched it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Originally, I had thought that he did not manage to find the exit, and was lacking a bit of luck in order to leave the illusion.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, judging from it now, he is deliberately staying in the illusory formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;His purpose is simply not to exit the illusory formation at all. Instead, he wants to snatch away all of the fruits that I used to set up the illusory formation!!!&rdquo;the undead man said.<br></p></div>
