        <h1>Chapter 4305</h1>
        <div> - Scared Breathless<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, the space around Chu Feng began to tremble.<br>Then, two figures appeared.<br>One left and one right, they stood on either side of Chu Feng.<br>They were a middle-aged man and an aged old ape.<br>While that ape looked very old, his gaze was so very fierce.<br>That gaze of his does not resemble a gaze that an ordinary monstrous beast could possess.<br>Anyone with experience could tell from that old ape&rsquo;s gaze that he was a monstrous king level existence.<br>As for the man, unlike the fierce looking old ape, he had a gentle gaze.<br>From a glance, he looked very mediocre. But, should one pay close attention, one would feel him to be unfathomable.<br>As for this man, he was none other than Chu Feng&rsquo;s father Chu Xuanyuan.<br>As for that aged old ape, he was Chu Xuanyuan's partner of many years, Old Ape.<br>Compared to when they were imprisoned in the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s forbidden area, the sensation Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape gave off had changed enormously.<br>Although the two of them have yet to unleash their oppressive might, one could tell merely by looking at them that they were people not to be trifled with.<br>But, Xianhai Renhu and the red-haired leader were not afraid.<br>After all, the two of them were also people with extraordinary origins themselves. Furthermore, behind them was the powerful Demon Morph Clan.<br>What was the Demon Morph Clan? It was a wicked power capable of bringing terror to the various major powers of the martial cultivation world.<br>&ldquo;If I am correct, you must be this youngster&rsquo;s father?&rdquo; Xianhai Renhu spoke with a stern voice.<br>While Chu Xuanyuan did not introduce himself, Xianhai Renhu was able to tell from their physical resemblance that they were father and son.<br>Chu Xuanyuan did not answer Xianhai Renhu&rsquo;s question.<br>He was acting as if he did not hear anything.<br>Seeing that, Xianhai Renhu frowned. A look of displeasure appeared on his face.<br>But, he didn&rsquo;t say anything.<br>The reason for that was because he had a faint feeling that his opponent&rsquo;s strength might not be weaker than his own. In fact, it was very possible that his opponent was stronger than him.<br>If that wasn&rsquo;t the case, he couldn&rsquo;t possibly fail to detect them.<br>To attack recklessly against an opponent like that was not a sensible act.<br>But, while Xianhai Renhu had determined Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape to not be people that should be trifled with, the others of the Demon Morph Clan clearly did not.<br>As Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape had not unleashed their oppressive mights, the others from the Demon Morph Clan had no idea how strong they were.<br>On top of that, Xianhai Renhu mentioned that Chu Xuanyuan and Chu Feng were father and son.<br>Because of that, the others from the Demon Morph Clan determined Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape to be from the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>What sort of place was the Holy Light Galaxy? In their eyes, it was nothing more than a desolate galaxy.<br>The martial cultivators of this place were all low level creatures to them.<br>How could such low tier individuals dare to ignore their Lord Xianhai Renhu? In their eyes, that was simply something that cannot be forgiven.<br>&ldquo;Insolent bastard! Are you deaf or what?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Lord is asking you a question! Why are you not answering at once?!&rdquo;<br>Because of that, a member of the Demon Morph Clan pointed at Chu Xuanyuan and lashed out angrily.<br>The tone of his voice was not only extremely arrogant, it was also filled with contempt toward Chu Xuanyuan.<br>&ldquo;Woosh---&rdquo;<br>But, right after that person said those words, the Old Ape disappeared.<br>When Old Ape reappeared, he had arrived within the Demon Morph Clansmen and was standing before the person that lashed out at Chu Xuanyuan.<br>&ldquo;Pow!---&rdquo;<br>Before the Demon Morph Clansmen could react to what was going on, Old Ape grabbed that Demon Morph Clansman&rsquo;s head and raised him up.<br>&ldquo;Wuuu---&rdquo;<br>At this moment, that Demon Morph Clansman began to howl in pain while struggling violently.<br>But, no matter how he struggled, it was all useless.<br>Before the Old Ape, he was akin to a chick that was powerless to break free.<br>&ldquo;Courting death!!!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, the other Demon Morph Clansmen all revealed their weapons and oppressive mights. They were planning to attack the Old Ape.<br>Suddenly, Old Ape clenched his grasp.<br>&ldquo;Puchi,&rdquo; blood splattered everywhere.<br>He had crushed apart the head of that Demon Morph Clansman.<br>Then, the headless corpse of that Demon Morph Clansman fell into the boundless starry sky below.<br>Seeing that scene, the Demon Morph Clansmen that had unleashed their weapons all stood stunned with their weapons in hand. None of them dared to rashly attack the Old Ape.<br>Merely that Old Ape&rsquo;s simple action had made them realize that seemingly very aged old ape was an extremely terrifying homicidal fiend.<br>Even if they all attacked him together, they will not be able to last many bouts against that homicidal fiend.<br>&ldquo;Two sirs, is it possible to let us live?&rdquo; Xianhai Renhu spoke again.<br>As matters stood, he was practically certain that Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape were extremely difficult opponents.<br>He doesn&rsquo;t wish to have a complete fall out against Chu Xuanyuan and the Old Ape at a time like this.<br>Even though one of their Demon Morph Clansman has been killed, he still wanted to reconcile.<br>&ldquo;You dared to touch our young master, yet you still wanted to leave here alive?&rdquo; Old Ape sneered.<br>&ldquo;Are you planning to refuse the face that we&rsquo;re giving you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you know who we are?!&rdquo; shouted the red-haired leader.<br>&ldquo;Boom---&rdquo;<br>Right after his words left his mouth, Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s clothes fluttered in the wind. Then, boundless oppressive might swept forth from his body. Like an invisible tornado, it instantly engulfed this region.<br>The moment that oppressive might arrived, the people from the Demon Morph Clan, including even Xianhai Renhu and that red-haired leader, all had an enormous change in their expression.<br>Shock and fright filled their eyes.<br>The reason for that was because they felt themselves to be nearly suffocating under Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>No matter what, when they were against Chu Feng who had his bloodline in a berserk state, they were able to fight against him.<br>But, facing Chu Feng&rsquo;s father, they simply do not even possess the qualification to stand off against him!!!<br>Although Xianhai Renhu was utterly terrified by Chu Xuanyuan, he still tried his hardest to contain his emotions and put up a calm front.<br>&ldquo;You two should know who we are.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Demon Morph Clan can be considered to be quite reputed in the martial cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even without me mentioning it, you should know of the way our Demon Morph Clan does things.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, our Demon Morph Clan&rsquo;s main army is already here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even our Lord Clan Chief is in this galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are willing to drop this matter at this, we will not look further into what happened here today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, if you insist on taking things to the extreme&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, it will not only be you all that will die, all the people in the entire Holy Light Galaxy will be buried with you,&rdquo; Xianhai Renhu threatened Chu Xuanyuan.<br>Realizing that he would not be able to defeat Chu Xuanyuan, he was forced with no other choice but to bring up his backing.<br>Of course, what he said was also the truth. The Demon Morph Clan&rsquo;s main army were indeed already in the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>Furthermore, if they were to die, the people from the Holy LIght Galaxy will most definitely suffer a calamity at the hands of the Demon Morph Clan.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing those threatening words, Chu Xuanyuan chuckled.<br>That laughter of his was so very mocking, so filled with contempt.<br>Seeing and hearing that laughter, Xianhai Renhu realized that the man before him seemed&hellip; to not place their Demon Morph Clan in his eyes at all.<br>&ldquo;What are you laughing at?!&rdquo; asked the red-haired leader furiously. He even unleashed his oppressive might as he spoke.<br>He was infuriated by Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s ridiculing attitude and was planning to attack him.<br>As for Chu Xuanyuan, he did not even bother to look at that furious red-haired leader. Instead, he looked to Xianhai Renhu.<br>&ldquo;Are you talking about them?&rdquo; asked Chu Xuanyuan.<br>&ldquo;Them? What do you mean by that?&rdquo; Xianhai Renhu was confused.<br>Right after he asked that question, Chu Xuanyuan raised his arm and a dark-black colored spheroid was tossed into the air behind him.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the sphere rapidly expanded in size. It expanded to the size of an entire world and covered this region of the starry sky.<br>That was a world filled with lightnings. Once that world was expanded to its full size, countless screams could be heard from within it.<br>That world simply resembled hell itself. It was terrifying to witness.<br>And, upon closer inspection, Xianhai Renhu, the red-haired leader and the others of the Demon Morph Clan all felt their scalps go numb with fear. They&rsquo;ve been scared breathless.<br>Some of the more cowardly individuals began to shiver in fear.<br>There were even several that fell unconscious from witnessing the sight.<br>Turned out, there were hundreds of millions of people inside that world.<br>All those people were being cruelly tortured.<br>They were all tied up and being struck by the terrifying lightnings inside that world in an orderly succession.<br>Those terrifying lightnings were breaking down their bodies and forcibly stripping them of their bloodline&rsquo;s powers.<br>What was deemed as the most cruel thing to do in this martial cultivation world was happening right before their eyes.<br>Furthermore, it was happening to hundreds of millions of people simultaneously.<br>But, if that was all, the vicious and ruthless Demon Morph Clansmen would not become this terrified.<br>The reason for their utter terror was because those hundreds of millions of people were all their Demon Morph Clansmen.<br>All of their Demon Morph Clan&rsquo;s top experts were in there.<br>Even their Lord Clan Chief was in there...<br></p></div>
