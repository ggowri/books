        <h1>Chapter 5694: Why Don’t You Try Unraveling This Formation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What truly shocked the crowd was that none of these guards were weaklings. How did Chu Feng find the strength to do so?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Could it be?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had witnessed Chu Feng clearing the Seven Stars Gravity Towers quickly put the two together, especially since his starlight energy resembled the constellation formation that had appeared when he reached the top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span>, as one of the witnesses, quickly became certain of that fact, and he couldn&rsquo;t hold himself back anymore despite his attempt to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You bastard! You&rsquo;re using our formation to kill our people? Die!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span> pointed a finger at Chu Feng, a massive hand manifested out of spirit power crushed down on Chu Feng. The entire square shook from the impact. This was an attack from a Saint-tier elder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t flustered at all. He changed his hand seal, and the starlight energy converged to form a massive light pillar that stopped Ling </span><span>Mouzi&rsquo;s</span><span> attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Saint-tier elder? Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span>, I overestimated you,&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span> didn&rsquo;t say a word, but he secretly channeled even more spirit power into the formation. His intensifying attack strained the Bloodline Square, causing many cracks to appear on its surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the power of the Saint-tier elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Chu Feng remained unfazed. On the contrary, his sneer widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He changed his hand seal once more, and the light pillar morphed into a sharp sword that pierced through the spirit power hand. He flung his arm backward, and the sword sliced right through the spirit power hand and surged toward the spectators in the stand behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those on the spectator stand couldn&rsquo;t possibly deal with an attack that had sliced through a Saint-tier elder&rsquo;s attack. To make things worse, the attack was targeted at where the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s juniors were gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this attack landed, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion wouldn&rsquo;t have a future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span> quickly flitted forth to stop Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack. It took him only two steps to reach the spectator stand where the juniors were gathered. Forming a hand seal with his left hand while pointing at the sky with his right, he released a surge of spirit power that morphed into a massive shield that spanned over ten thousand meters in length.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The starlight sword fell on the shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Astonishingly, the starlight sword shattered upon contact. It was reduced to starlight specks and scattered down from the sides of the shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span> was gleeful at having blocked Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack, only to turn pale a second later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scattered starlight specks that had fallen off the shield suddenly morphed into countless smaller starlight swords and whizzed toward him. They moved so fast that it was already too late for him to dodge them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this desperate moment, another person wielding a formation spear rushed forward to protect Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span>. He brandished his spear and stopped every single one of the smaller starlight swords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Saint-tier Elder Jie </span><span>Qinghe</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jie </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> looked at Chu Feng with conflicted eyes. There were many words he wanted to say, but he held himself back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elders, why are you dawdling around? Work with me to kill that bastard!&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span> roared as a peculiar light glowed from his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five elders quickly positioned themselves at the outer perimeter of the Bloodline Square. They simultaneously formed a series of hand seals, constructing a barrier around Chu Feng. This barrier served to trap him while protecting those from the </span><span>spectator stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Fu Xing and the others, who were previously on stage with him, had run to the safer spectator stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five elders behind the barrier were all Saint-tier elders, with Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> being one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Stop now, Chu Feng. We can still talk things out,&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> told Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span> interjected, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late. He has already killed our people. The only fate awaiting him is death. Elders, work with me to kill that bastard!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span> infused a peculiar surge of spirit power into the barrier, and a few other Saint-tier elders did the same as well. Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> and Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> were hesitant to do so, but with the others coming to an implicit consensus, they had no choice but to follow suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless marks formed on the surface of the barrier. They were odd patterns resembling birds and swords, but they emanated incomparable killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Feather Sword Massacre Formation?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion identified the formation right away, but they didn&rsquo;t think that they would have to resort to such a formation just to kill a mere Chu Feng, not to mention that there were seven Saint-tier elders collaborating on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Looks like it&rsquo;s the end,&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> said as she closed her eyes, not wanting to watch on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn&rsquo;t just her. Practically everyone thought that Chu Feng was a goner too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grar</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chirps could be heard, as the marks on the barrier morphed into weird feathered birds that shot at Chu Feng like arrows. Their sheer destructive might </span><span>produced</span><span> terrifying shockwaves that cracked even the barrier itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, when the attack finally stopped, Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice echoed, &ldquo;Is that all there is to your lousy massacre formation?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful gale blew away the dust cloud on the stage, revealing an unharmed Chu Feng. By then, the starlight energy around him had already morphed into countless arrows. With a raise of his arm, the starlight arrows shot out on command to strike the barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Break!&rdquo; Chu Feng roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of the starlight arrows simultaneously exploded, blowing the barrier into bits. If not for the seven Saint-tier elders swiftly forming another barrier, the shockwaves from the explosion would have killed countless people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Bastard!&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span> looked as if he wanted to eat someone alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, he took out a talisman that emanated the aura of the Ancient Era. The other six Saint-tier elders took out similar talismans as well. They were planning to use the power of the talismans to construct an even more powerful offensive formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; an aged voice echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Mansion Master, are you </span><span>all</span><span> right?&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span> asked concernedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What can possibly happen to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The face of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master remained pale, but his aura was unfazed. The earlier shock had caught him off guard, but as someone who stood at the top of the world of cultivation, it didn&rsquo;t take him long to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Mouzi</span><span> and the others stowed away their talismans, knowing that it was time for them to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng turned to look at the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master as well. Even though he had already proved his talent, the latter still looked at him with eyes filled with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of attacking Chu Feng, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master asked, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you kicked up such a fuss because you want me to acknowledge you?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking too much. I don&rsquo;t need your acknowledgment,&rdquo; Chu Feng scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo; The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master harrumphed. &ldquo;You asked if your father is unworthy of my daughter earlier? I&rsquo;ll answer your question. He&rsquo;s unworthy as long as I deem it so! How dare someone with a mere Heavenly Lightning Bloodline sully my </span><span>Ranqing</span><span>? You ought to be kneeling down in gratitude! It was my daughter who gave you that bloodline of yours!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master exerted his oppressive might on Chu Feng. His attack was blocked by the starlight energy, but the starlight energy began shaking, a sign that it was on the verge of crumbling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn&rsquo;t take much effort for him to construct a massacre formation several times stronger than the one from the Saint-tier elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the strength of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, Chu Feng remained unmoved. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t worthy of having me kneel before you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You lowly thing. Even my daughter&rsquo;s Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline can&rsquo;t change the lowliness in your blood. Do you think you can do as you please in my Seven Realms Sacred Mansion just because you obtained the Seven Stars Gravity Towers&rsquo; protection formation?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master raised his hand and drew out all of the starlight energy Chu Feng had been imbued with, thus unraveling his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Chu Feng was left vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Did you know I was the one who constructed the Seven Stars Gravity Towers?&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion raised their hands high and cheered, celebrating their Mansion Master&rsquo;s overwhelming strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chu Feng was unmoved. &ldquo;Ah, so you were the one who constructed the Seven Stars Gravity Towers. How formidable. What about this? Did you construct this too?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm began to glow, then he abruptly stomped his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blinding golden light swept into the surroundings, instantaneously shattering the </span><span>Bloodline Square. Even the elders spewed blood in the face of the sudden attack, let alone the juniors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd squinted their eyes and saw Chu Feng floating in mid-air. There were countless golden imprints on his body, and they overlapped with one another to form a radiant golden armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Chu Feng raised his palm up. All of his energy originated from his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were rendered speechless. How could they not recognize the imprint on his palm? It was from the World Spiritist Immortal King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn&rsquo;t believe Chu Feng had received the World Spiritist Immortal King&rsquo;s recognition!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chu Feng paid no heed to the crowd. With his hand raised toward the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master, he sneered, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try unraveling this formation of mine then?&rdquo;</span></p></div>
