        <div> - This Sort Of Terror<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to save her? What makes you think you can save her?&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law asked. His eyes were burning with deep rage.<br>As matters stood, he had reached a point of being utterly incapable of tolerating Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng chuckled. Then, he said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Just because you don&rsquo;t have the balls to go and save your woman, you&rsquo;re refusing to allow me to go save her now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; you dare say this sort of thing to me?!&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law gnashed his teeth furiously. As a man, he felt that he had received an enormous humiliation.<br>&ldquo;Bastard, you must be a spy from the Monstrous Clan! You will be killed!&rdquo; Suddenly, Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law shouted angrily. Then, he raised the Incomplete Ancestral Armament in his hand and hacked down toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s head.<br>He was trying to kill Chu Feng with that one attack. Furthermore, he was planning to hack Chu Feng in two.<br>Seeing that scene, Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s expression changed enormously. After all, his brother-in-law was a rank seven Half Martial Ancestor.<br>Although Chu Feng was very powerful and capable of easily killing a rank six Half Martial Ancestor, Zhan Lingtong still had no idea as to what Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was.<br>As for his brother-in-law, Zhan Lingtong knew very well how powerful he was. Else, his older sister would not have taken a fancy to him.<br>Thus, at that moment, Zhan Lingtong was uncertain as to whether or not Chu Feng would be able to safely block the attack.<br>As for the people from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan, they all revealed smiles of joy as they awaited the disaster that would befall Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng had been insulting them the entire time since he had arrived. Thus, they felt very displeased with him to begin with. They were delighted that Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law would attack Chu Feng.<br>Furthermore, they felt that since Chu Feng was not someone from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan, he must be an ordinary commoner.<br>For ordinary commoners, how could they possibly match Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law? Thus, they felt that Chu Feng would definitely die.<br>Right at the moment when the Incomplete Ancestral Armament was about to strike Chu Feng&rsquo;s head, Chu Feng suddenly raised his hand.<br>&ldquo;Clank!&rdquo; Sparks fluttered about as energy ripples surged forth. The surrounding bystanders were all forced back repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?!!!&rdquo;<br>When the crowd managed to stabilize themselves and turned to look, they were all stunned.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had actually managed to stop the Incomplete Ancestral Armament with his palm.<br>&ldquo;Is he even a human?!&rdquo;<br>The crowd were unable to calm themselves. They were filled with incomparable shock.<br>That was an Incomplete Ancestral Armament. Furthermore, it was being used by a rank seven Half Martial Ancestor.<br>How could that guy before them be able to stop the Incomplete Ancestral Armament with his hand? Exactly how powerful was he?<br>&ldquo;Scared of going to fight against the people from the Monstrous Clan, and instead starting to show your might to me here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately for you, your granddaddy Chu Feng is not accustomed to your shortcomings.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he waved his sleeve, and Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law was thrown to the ground with his Incomplete Ancestral Armament like a scarecrow.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Surging energy ripples were formed from the enormous power behind the collision. An enormous ravine appeared on the previously flat earth.<br>As for Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law, he was smashed deep underground. From this, it could be seen how powerful Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack was.<br>&ldquo;Milord!!!&rdquo;<br>Witnessing that scene, the people from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan all started to panic. One by one, they flew toward the ravine that was still filled with thick surging dust.<br>The reason for that was because they had no idea whether or not their lord was still alive at that moment.<br>After all, Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack appeared to be so fierce and ruthless.<br>Even Zhan Lingtong was stunned. Even though he had already experienced how fierce and ruthless Chu Feng was, he had never expected that Chu Feng would remain so fierce and ruthless against his brother-in-law.<br>Of course, as the person was, after all, his brother-in-law, Zhan Lingtong was worried.<br>&ldquo;Stop being stunned. Come, follow me to save your sister.&rdquo;<br>At the moment when Zhan Lingtong was in a daze, Chu Feng grabbed him. Then, a strong wind surged past, and Chu Feng and Zhan Lingtong disappeared.<br>Together with them, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clansman that had escaped also disappeared.<br>&hellip;...<br>The location where Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s older sister was imprisoned was actually not far from the final territory of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan.<br>Being guided by that escapee, Chu Feng and Zhan Lingtong soon arrived at the place where that Yao Liutian was resting.<br>It was a base camp, a gold, dazzling, glorious, and imposing camp.<br>In the past, it used to be a branch camp for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan. But at that moment, it was occupied by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Monstrous Clan.<br>&ldquo;He actually chose to set up camp here. How are we supposed to find my older sister?&rdquo;<br>Zhan Lingtong was so anxious that he teared up. Although they had arrived at that place quickly with the help of Chu Feng&rsquo;s secret skill, Zhan Lingtong knew that former branch camp of their Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan very well.<br>Each and every one of the buildings there was infused with spirit formations.<br>Not only were there defensive formations on them, but there were also sound-proofing and concealing formations on them.<br>Even if one were to increase the power of one&rsquo;s sight through special methods, one would still be unable to see through those spirit formations. As such, it was simply impossible for them to find his older sister.<br>Furthermore, Yao Liutian was a famous lecher. He had lusted over his older sister Zhan Lingling for more than a day or two.<br>Perhaps he might be planning to sexually assault his older sister. If they were to delay in the slightest, his sister&rsquo;s innocence might be ruined.<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;Found her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Found her?!&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong and that injured War Clansman both revealed astonished expressions.<br>&ldquo;Is your sister wearing silver armor with a head of black hair in a ponytail tied with a silver band?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to ask Zhan Lingtong.<br>&ldquo;Right, right, right. That is my sister,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong nodded repeatedly. He also revealed even greater astonishment in his eyes. Originally, he had been skeptical. However, after hearing what Chu Feng said, he was certain that Chu Feng had discovered his sister.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, your sister has only suffered some minor injuries right now. It is nothing major. Furthermore&hellip; as of now, she is still safe.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, that Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s animal is conspiring to attack. If I do not act now, I fear that your sister&rsquo;s innocence will be ruined,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I beg of you, please save Lady Ling.&rdquo;<br>Hearing what Chu Feng said, that War Clansman kneeled in midair with a &ldquo;putt.&rdquo; Then, he actually started to kowtow to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Even without you begging me, I would save her. Merely, the two of you do not have to get involved in this. It will do if you just stay here and wait for my return.&rdquo; After Chu Feng finished saying those words, lightning flashed in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Zzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment,<br>Lightning<br>Wings extended from Chu Feng&rsquo;s back, and<br>Lightning<br>Armor covered his body.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation increased from rank nine Half Martial Ancestor to rank two Martial Ancestor.<br>The Magma Emperor Sword covered with rising flames also appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Then, with the Magma Emperor Sword in hand and his body covered with<br>Lightning<br>Armor and<br>Lightning<br>Wings, Chu Feng streaked down from the sky toward the direction where Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s older sister and that Yao Liutian were like a divine eagle capturing its prey.<br>&ldquo;Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Rumbles sounded nonstop as surging energy ripples rushed into the sky.<br>However, that situation only persisted for a short moment before Chu Feng soared back into the sky, returning to where Zhan Lingtong and that injured War Clansman had remained.<br>At that moment, not only was Chu Feng completely unscathed, there was also a beautiful woman beside him. As for that woman, she was naturally Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s older sister, Zhan Lingling.<br>At that moment, it was not only Zhan Lingtong and that injured War Clansman that had stunned expressions on their faces; even Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s older sister had the same sort of stunned expression.<br>The reason for that was because she had discovered that she had been saved before she even knew what was going on. As for the person who had saved her, he was not someone that she knew, but rather a very handsome and foreign man.<br>&ldquo;That is?!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s gaze changed enormously. He was shocked to discover that Chu Feng was also holding a head in his hand. As for that head, it was actually Yao Liutian&rsquo;s head.<br>It meant that Chu Feng had already killed Yao Liutian. But, who was Yao Liutian? He was a grand, vicious and imposing rank one Martial Ancestor.<br>Countless people in their Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan did not dare to confront him. Even their elders that also possessed cultivations of rank one Martial Ancestor might not necessarily be able to defeat Yao Liutian.<br>Yet, Chu Feng had actually managed to behead Yao Liutian in such a short period of time. As such, how could he not be astonished?<br>&ldquo;Fearless humans! You dare intrude upon our Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s territory?!!!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the monstrous beasts of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Monstrous Clan discovered Chu Feng and the others. A large group of troops began to surround Chu Feng and the others from all directions.<br>At that moment, Zhan Lingtong subconsciously grew nervous. After all, Yao Liutian&rsquo;s subordinates were all extraordinary individuals.<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;My mood right now is not good. As such, I cannot let you all live.&rdquo;<br>Then, Chu Feng swept his Magma Emperor Sword across the sky.<br>In an instant, flames raged as magma sprung forth. Blazing light burned through the sky, igniting their surroundings.<br>&ldquo;Ahhh!!!&rdquo;<br>In an instant, screams began to sound nonstop.<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s army of thousands that were approaching from all directions were all devoured by the blaze, and died when their bodies exploded. In an instant, they were all killed by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Zhan Lingtong and the injured War Clansman were completely stunned. It was as if they were petrified.<br>It was only at that moment that they truly realized how frighteningly powerful the man before them was.<br>Even Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s older sister was looking to Chu Feng with complicated emotions in her eyes.<br>If one must describe her gaze, it would be the gaze of a woman who felt great adoration and admiration toward a man.<br>After all, the more powerful a man was, the more women would be fond of him.<br><br></p></div>
