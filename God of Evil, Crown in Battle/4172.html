        <h1>Chapter 4171</h1>
        <div> - Poisonous Pellet Of Certain Death<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Lord Tonghe waved his arm, and boundless martial power rushed out from his sleeve.<br>The martial power transformed into countless flying swords that surrounded Long Busheng and Long Xiao, who were suspended in the air.<br>He was not joking around. If Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t reveal himself, those flying swords would pierce into Long Busheng and Long Xiao.<br>Those martial power swords were extremely strong. They were most definitely going to take the lives of the grandfather and grandson.<br>Seeing this, Chu Feng was simply unable to continue to watch with folded arms.<br>His conscience wouldn&rsquo;t allow it.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, please take care of senior Long&rsquo;s injuries.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words to Grandmaster Liangqiu, Chu Feng stood up and soared into the sky. He was flying towards Lord Tonghe.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what are you doing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mess around. Quickly, come back!&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng flying towards Lord Tonghe, Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others that did not know about the relationship between Chu Feng and the grandfather-grandson pair thought that he was planning to seek justice for Long Daozhi.<br>Because of that, they were all urging him to return.<br>However, not only did Chu Feng not pay any attention to their dissuasions, he instead spoke with a stern voice, &ldquo;I alone take responsibility for my actions. If you all wish to settle things, then come at me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The grudges between myself and the Nine Principles Dragon Sect have nothing to do with them.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words immediately caught the crowd&rsquo;s attention.<br>The eyes of everyone present all turned to Chu Feng.<br>Even those aloof and remote members of the Dragon Clan were looking at him.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the main culprit?&rdquo;<br>The crowd began to size him up. Surprise and curiosity filled their eyes.<br>After all, apart from the involved parties, no one knew what had happened between the Nine Principles Dragon Sect and Chu Feng.<br>Not even Long Daozhi and the others knew.<br>&ldquo;You are not the person I&rsquo;m looking for. Are you trying to become a scapegoat by coming out here?&rdquo;<br>The Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s young sectmaster Long Shangsong carefully inspected Chu Feng, and then shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Not me? Have a proper look.&rdquo;<br>When Chu Feng spoke again, his voice had changed.<br>Then, his appearance began to change.<br>The appearance he changed into was none other than the appearance he'd worn when he had toyed with the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s young sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No wonder I couldn&rsquo;t find you. You disguised yourself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Despicable bastard! You dare to mess with me?! I&rsquo;ll have you dead today!&rdquo;<br>Once he recognized Chu Feng, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s young sectmaster immediately started gnashing his teeth furiously. He revealed his Incomplete Exalted Armament as he spoke and intended to kill Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Mn?&rdquo;<br>However, when he was about to attack Chu Feng, an ice-cold gaze landed on his body.<br>Upon sensing that gaze, he immediately closed his mouth and retrieved his oppressive might. He was so frightened that he did not even dare to raise his head.<br>The reason for that was because that ice-cold gaze had come from Lord Tonghe.<br>Regardless of how despicable of a person Lord Tonghe was in the shadows, he put forth an upright outward appearance.<br>Since he'd said that he would not take the main culprit&rsquo;s life should he show himself, he would naturally have to keep his word.<br>Thus, how could he possibly allow the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s young sectmaster to directly kill Chu Feng?<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a sudden slap landed on the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s young sectmaster&rsquo;s face.<br>That slap was not light at all. It was so strong that it deformed the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s young sectmaster&rsquo;s face.<br>However, although he was slapped, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s young sectmaster did not even dare to utter a single fart.<br>The reason for that was because the person that had slapped him was his father, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;You absolute disgrace! Since when are you qualified to speak here?!&rdquo; the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster shouted angrily.<br>He was actually doing this for the good of his son. If he didn&rsquo;t teach his son a lesson, someone else would.<br>After all, his son was acting with no regard for Lord Tonghe.<br>&ldquo;Let it pass. We&rsquo;re all people from the Dragon Clan, we should not make things difficult for fellow clansmen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Have your son examine him carefully, and be certain that that man is the culprit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Dragon Clan has always been distinct in our rewards and punishments. We will definitely not willfully slaughter innocent people,&rdquo; said Lord Tonghe.<br>&ldquo;Lord Tonghe, that&rsquo;s him alright. Even if he is to be turned to ash, I would still recognize him,&rdquo; said Long Shangsong.<br>&ldquo;Recognize him even if he was turned to ash?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, why didn&rsquo;t you manage to find him amongst the vast crowd earlier?&rdquo; asked Lord Tonghe.<br>&ldquo;Milord, that man is simply too cunning. Else, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been toyed with by him,&rdquo; said Long Shangsong.<br>&ldquo;Enough. I will uphold justice for you.&rdquo;<br>As Lord Tonghe spoke, he turned to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You could be considered to be courageous. I will also honor my word.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will not take your life today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, whilst you can escape death, you cannot escape punishment.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be too excessive on you either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Swallow this medicinal pellet, and then scram.&rdquo;<br>As Lord Tonghe spoke, he took out a medicinal pellet.<br>When Chu Feng saw the medicinal pellet, he cursed in his heart.<br>As a world spiritist, he was able to tell that that medicinal pellet would not just torture him.<br>That medicinal pellet was extremely terrifying. If Chu Feng were to take it, he would be tortured for a very long time.<br>Unless he was given an antidote, he would be tortured to death.<br>What bullshit &lsquo;escape death&rsquo;?<br>He was simply planning to take Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.<br>Furthermore, he wanted Chu Feng to die miserably on top of that.<br>&ldquo;Lord Tonghe, no matter what, you&rsquo;re someone with prestige.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To openly hand a poisonous medicinal pellet to me and then say that I will be spared death, this is rather unsuitable, no?&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;While this is indeed a poisonous pellet, it will not take your life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You had the courage to toy around with our Dragon Clan, yet you lack the courage to take this pellet?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that this old man has thought too highly of you,&rdquo; Lord Tonghe mocked.<br>&ldquo;That is clearly a poisonous pellet of certain death. There are so many world spiritists present, all of us can tell what it is,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>However, after hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, Lord Tonghe suddenly narrowed his eyes. He said, &ldquo;Oh? Then have them tell me what sort of medicinal pellet this is.&rdquo;<br>Once Lord Tonghe said those words, before Chu Feng could even say anything, many voices sounded from below.<br>&ldquo;That medicinal pellet is not fatal. This old man can vouch for it with my life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is indeed not fatal. It&rsquo;s merely a simple medicinal pellet used for punishing people.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That coward is afraid of the punishment. For him to dare frame Lord Tonghe, he should be beheaded.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, you should kill him. A despicable man like that should not be kept alive.&rdquo;<br>However, none of the voices from below were speaking up for Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng knew that they must&rsquo;ve all noticed how powerful that poisonous pellet was.<br>However, they did not dare to go against Lord Tonghe. Thus, even though they knew the truth, they did not dare speak it.<br>&ldquo;Lord Tonghe, whilst it is true that he had toyed with the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s young sectmaster, it was the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s young sectmaster who stole our Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Dragon Vein Yin Yang Stone is extremely important to us. We could not allow it to be taken away like that. That&rsquo;s why, with no alternative, this benefactor here decided to dupe the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s young sectmaster.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is not our fault. He was the one in the wrong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if he is a member of your Dragon Clan now, you shouldn&rsquo;t invert right and wrong to side with him like this.&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the majority of the crowd did not dare to speak the truth, Long Xiao suddenly spoke.<br>Then, Long Xiao&rsquo;s grandfather also began to reveal what had happened.<br>The grandfather-grandson pair wanted to catch the crowd&rsquo;s attention and reverse the situation with the truth.<br>However, they were simply too naive.<br>They had no idea that the truth didn&rsquo;t matter anymore.<br>What mattered was that no one present dared to go against Lord Tonghe.<br>No one present cared about what the truth was. They only wanted to flatter Lord Tonghe.<br>Regardless of the decision that Lord Tonghe made, they would be in favor of it as long as it didn&rsquo;t harm them.<br>Even if he was going to willfully slaughter the innocent, they wouldn&rsquo;t care.<br>Thus, they would care less when it was someone that had actually offended the Dragon Clan.<br>&ldquo;Irredeemable criminals. To dare to argue at a time like this, you shall all be severely punished!&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, the words spoken by Long Xiao and his grandfather incurred the ire of Lord Tonghe.<br>Right after Lord Tonghe finished saying those words, the countless martial power swords that surrounded Long Xiao and his grandfather immediately changed form. They turned into countless whips that began to lash the grandfather-grandson pair.<br></p></div>
