        <h1>Chapter 5297</h1>
        <div>: I&rsquo;ll Kill You Too<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief!&rdquo;<br>The elders of the Situ World Spiritist Clan turned to Situ Kunye with pale faces, only to find that the latter had gone completely silent. Not even Situ Kunye could have imagined that things would turn out like this.<br>&ldquo;Escape!&rdquo;<br>Someone amidst the Situ World Spiritist Clan suddenly shouted. The following instant, many Situ World Spiritist Clansmen fled in all directions.<br>They were being intimidated into fleeing despite being on their home turf!<br>Gahh!<br>Cries of agony ensued. Those who tried to run away exploded into bits.<br>Situ Kunye had already sealed off the surroundings with his formations. No one could have escaped under his watch. It was just shocking how he had killed his own clansmen without any mercy.<br>&ldquo;Deserters will be executed as traitors!&rdquo; Situ Kunye roared without turning around.<br>No Situ World Spiritist Clansmen dared to flee anymore after hearing those words, especially not after witnessing Situ Kunye&rsquo;s act of cruelty. They could only turn their attention to Chu Feng and pray that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to grasp the &lsquo;Offense&rsquo; formation within two hours&rsquo; time.<br>To their surprise, the rate at which Chu Feng grasped control of the &lsquo;Offense&rsquo; formation remained slow despite having severed Situ Kunye&rsquo;s connection with it. At this rate, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to control the formation even after a month&rsquo;s time, let alone two hours.<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen were relieved to see that.<br>&ldquo;Even though the connection was severed, we did manage to pose an obstruction to Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Long live our clan chief!&rdquo;<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen sang praises for Situ Kunye.<br>A smile also surfaced on Situ Kunye&rsquo;s face. He didn&rsquo;t think that he would be able to pose an obstruction to Chu Feng despite having lost his connection to the &lsquo;Offense&rsquo; formation.<br>On the other hand, Chu Feng was getting more and more flustered with each passing second. Cold sweat drenched his face, and he began fumbling around.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, weren&rsquo;t you acting all smug earlier? Why don&rsquo;t you tell us who calls the shots now?&rdquo; Situ Kunye sneered.<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t answer the question. Just trying to grasp control over the &lsquo;Offense&rsquo; formation was already a headache to him.<br>Two hours passed in a flash.<br>Chu Feng did make progress with the &lsquo;Offense&rsquo; formation during this period of time, but it was far from sufficient. Those who were hoping that he could overthrow the Situ World Spiritist Clan had already fallen completely silent by now.<br>As much as they were impressed with Chu Feng&rsquo;s means and guts, the tides were favoring the Situ World Spiritist Clan. It was not that Chu Feng was inept, but that the Situ World Spiritist Clan had the decisive advantage here. After all, they were on the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s home turf.<br>Moments later, the protection formation began to dissipate.<br>Without the protection formation to shield him, Chu Feng was like a fish on a chopping board. He was helpless against the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>Woo!<br>Deafening cheers filled the air, relaying the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen&rsquo;s joy, anger, and killing intent.<br>&ldquo;Kill! Kill! Kill!&rdquo; they chanted.<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen couldn&rsquo;t wait to end Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.<br>Situ Kunye&rsquo;s eyes had also turned blood-red. He had devised countless ways to torture Chu Feng over the past two hours, and it was about time to put them to practice. He would show everyone the fate of those who dared to make an enemy out of the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>Boom!<br>All of a sudden, Chu Feng raised his palm up high. Terrifying might descended from the sky, forcing all of the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen to the ground. Even Situ Kunye wasn&rsquo;t spared from the might.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>Situ Kunye widened his eyes in horror. The pressure crushing down on him was not one that he could fight against. But this shouldn&rsquo;t have been possible. Chu Feng should have not been able to&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Haa. It sure was hard to maintain the act,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked with a faint smile.<br>As he wiped off the sweat from his face, a contemptuous smile formed on his lips. At the same time, the &lsquo;Offense&rsquo; formation that he had struggled to grasp control of earlier fused into his body.<br>The powerful might he had exerted earlier came from the &lsquo;Offense&rsquo; formation.<br>In other words, Chu Feng had successfully grasped control over the &lsquo;Offense&rsquo; formation!<br>&ldquo;H-he did it on purpose!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He was putting on an act! We were deceived by him!&rdquo;<br>It finally dawned on the crowd that Chu Feng had been putting on an act thus far. He was toying with the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>Smiles faded from the faces of the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen. Their killing intent dissipated in the face of despair. They could sense how terrifying the pressure crushing down on them was. It was a force that could instantaneously reduce them to meat paste.<br>&ldquo;Milord!&rdquo;<br>Yue Lian&rsquo;s subordinates turned to Yue Lian.<br>&ldquo;That brat is more dangerous than I thought. We shouldn&rsquo;t stay here any longer. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Yue Lian said in a fluster.<br>&ldquo;Stop hiding and come out!&rdquo;<br>Just as Yue Lian was about to make his escape, Chu Feng suddenly waved his sleeves. Yue Lian&rsquo;s concealment immediately shattered, bringing him and his subordinates out in the open. They tumbled down from the sky and fell right before Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;<br>None of the crowd recognized Yue Lian and the others.<br>&ldquo;Old thing, do you think that I&rsquo;ll allow you to escape? I&rsquo;ll send you to your doom with the Situ World Spiritist Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He turned to the deceased members of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect and bowed. &ldquo;Elders, I shall redress your grievances today and eradicate the Situ World Spiritist Clan on your behalf!&rdquo;<br>Killing intent flared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Knowing that Chu Feng was going to make a move, Situ Kunye cried out, &ldquo;Milord, save me!&rdquo;<br>At the same time, Chu Feng channeled the &lsquo;Offense&rsquo; formation to kill Yue Lian and everyone from the Situ World Spiritist Clan. But before his attack could land, a powerful force suddenly deflected his attack.<br>Chu Feng was stunned. His attack, harnessing the power of the &lsquo;Offense&rsquo; formation, was comparable to a pinnacle Half-God level cultivator. A person who could deflect his attack would have to be a pinnacle Half-God level cultivator at the very least.<br>A split moment later, an elder appeared on top of Situ Kunye and the others.<br>An uproar broke out amidst the crowd.<br>The elder was dressed in the robes of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, but more than that, the elder was a well-known figure.<br>&ldquo;Lord Jia, save me!&rdquo; Yue Lian looked as if he had seen his savior.<br>&ldquo;Shut up, you disgrace.&rdquo; Lord Jiu glared at Yue Lian.<br>&ldquo;Lord Jia.&rdquo;<br>Situ Kunye and the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen rose to their feet. It was clear that Situ Kunye knew that Lord Jia was here all along. That was also why he wasn&rsquo;t afraid despite knowing that Chu Feng had tricks up his sleeves.<br>He also had his own ace too.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll resolve this issue,&rdquo; Lord Jia said before turning to Chu Feng. &ldquo;Young friend, could you let this matter go?&rdquo;<br>Situ Kunye couldn&rsquo;t accept such a conclusion. How could he let Chu Feng get away scot-free after how the latter humiliated their Situ World Spiritist Clan?<br>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; Lord Jia glared at Situ Kunye. &ldquo;Do you know who he is?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was stunned to hear those words. Wasn&rsquo;t it already a known fact that Chu Feng was Song Luoyi&rsquo;s grandson? Did he still have other identities that they didn&rsquo;t know about?<br>&ldquo;A bunch of countryside bumpkins. He is the champion of the Trial of the Strongest&rsquo;s late Martial Exalted level category,&rdquo; Lord Jia said.<br>&ldquo;Trial of the Strongest?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was initially stunned to hear those words.<br>However, someone amidst the crowd soon asked, &ldquo;Milord, are you referring to the Trial of the Strongest hosted by the Totem Dragon Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Would I have mentioned it if it wasn&rsquo;t hosted by the Totem Dragon Clan?&rdquo; Lord Jia asked.<br>Boom!<br>The crowd felt goosebumps all over their bodies.<br>Chu Feng&hellip; is the champion of the Trial of the Strongest&rsquo;s late Martial Exalted level category? Is he actually that powerful?<br>Even Situ Kunye found it hard to believe too. As someone coming from the Totem Galaxy, there was no way he wouldn&rsquo;t have heard of the Trial of the Strongest.<br>&ldquo;This young friend over here defeated both Ouyang Canjian and Xu Tianjian, the two frontrunners in the tournament. There&rsquo;s no questioning the legitimacy of his victory. News should have already spread by now, but I guess it takes time to reach this backward place. Do you finally understand who he is now?&rdquo;<br>Lord Jia shot a glance at the crowd.<br>Respect could be seen in the eyes of the crowd when they looked at Chu Feng. At the same time, fear colored the faces of the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen.<br>Situ Kunye was at a loss for words.<br>It was one thing if Chu Feng had won the tournament by chance, but he had defeated Ouyang Canjian and Xu Tianjian, the two individuals recognized to be the strongest cultivators beneath Half-God level in the Totem Galaxy. That added to the prestige of Chu Feng&rsquo;s victory.<br>A junior who possessed this much talent would surely be highly regarded by the Totem Dragon Clan. Many top powers would fawn on him too. Perhaps, Chu Feng might already have many people backing him up.<br>Situ Kunye had to admit that the Situ World Spiritist Clan was not in a position to do anything to Chu Feng anymore.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, I am Jia Dongqi, an elder from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. I know about your grudges with the Situ World Spiritist Clan, but that&rsquo;s a matter of the past. You have killed many people in the Situ World Spiritist Clan. As the saying goes, &lsquo;an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.&rsquo; Why don&rsquo;t you bury the hatchet with them on my account? I promise you that the Situ World Spiritist Clan won&rsquo;t find any trouble with you from this day onward,&rdquo; Jia Dongqi said.<br>Chu Feng laughed in contempt.<br>&ldquo;Bury the hatchet? Would you have been able to bury the hatchet if your family members had been killed?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, I understand that you&rsquo;re a sentimental person. All right, I&rsquo;ll have the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen apologize to you and the deceased members of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect. Would that be fine?&rdquo; Jia Dongqi asked.<br>That only made Chu Feng&rsquo;s face turn colder. He spat, &ldquo;Scram.&rdquo;<br>The crowd lurched in horror when they heard Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>Jia Dongqi was not small fry like the Situ World Spiritist Clan. This was an elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect they were talking about here! Just the influence he wielded at his disposal was a terror to deal with, let alone the fact that he was a powerful cultivator!<br>Yet, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t showing him any respect at all!<br>While the crowd was still shocked by those words, Chu Feng spoke up once more, &ldquo;Continue yapping away and I&rsquo;ll kill you too.&rdquo;<br></div>
