        <h1>Chapter 4087</h1>
        <div> - Li Mengyue<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master let out a loud roar.<br>Heaven and earth trembled with the roar. Visible sound waves emerged from his mouth and swept violently toward Chu Feng.<br>Enveloped by the sound wave, Chu Feng&rsquo;s giant dragon of light began to crumble.<br>The giant light dragon that was able to suppress a rank two Exalted Taboo was destroyed in the blink of an eye.<br>Ravaged by the might of the sound wave, Chu Feng, although not injured, was forced back repeatedly.<br>That said, the sound wave that landed on Chu Feng was merely the remnants that had destroyed the giant light dragon.<br>This made the crowd realize one thing -- no matter how strong Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power might be, he was still unable to contend against the Demonized Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>&ldquo;Terrifying!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is that the power of Demonization?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although his cultivation is still that of a rank four Utmost Exalted, his battle power is already infinitely close to that of a rank five Utmost Exalted, no?&rdquo;<br>Looks of sympathy appeared in the crowd&rsquo;s eyes as they looked to Chu Feng again.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng shouldn&rsquo;t have forced the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master into a corner. That man is simply a rabid dog. He&rsquo;s so crazy that he&rsquo;s determined to pull Chu Feng down with him even in death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Pity. This is truly a pity. Must a genius like that really fall here?&rdquo;<br>Practically everyone felt that Chu Feng was doomed.<br>Faced with the Demonized Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master, Chu Feng simply had no chance of survival.<br>&ldquo;Brat, I&rsquo;ll have you die!&rdquo;<br>The Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master spoke again. The tone that he spoke with had changed enormously.<br>His voice no longer sounded human at all.<br>That voice was even more terrifying than a beast&rsquo;s voice.<br>After he finished saying those words, he waved his arm toward the sky.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>A dark black sword ray was released from his arm.<br>That sword ray measured ten thousand meters long. As it swept through the air, it split through everything in its path. With a might seemingly capable of obliterating everything, it rushed to attack Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right when the black sword ray was about to reach Chu Feng, it suddenly dissipated into thin air.<br>No, to be exact, that sword ray had encountered a power stronger than itself. It was that power that had forcibly cancelled out the sword ray.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that Chu Feng is able to take on even the Demonized Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master?&rdquo;<br>The crowd looked to Chu Feng with eyes filled with shock.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you?&rdquo;<br>However, to their surprise, even Chu Feng had a look of shock on his face.<br>The only difference between Chu Feng and the crowd was the direction that their shocked eyes were looking at.<br>For the crowd, they were looking at Chu Feng. But Chu Feng was looking directly ahead.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the space before Chu Feng began to squirm. Then, a figure appeared before him.<br>It was a woman.<br>She was the female elder tasked to enter the Purple Star Variance Realm with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her?&rdquo;<br>Many people outside were surprised to see that female elder.<br>This was especially true for the people from the Purple Star Hall.<br>&hellip;...<br>In fact, after seeing the appearance of that female elder, even the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was greatly shocked.<br>Because of that, he turned his gaze to Pang Youyang, the Supreme Elder standing behind him, and asked, &ldquo;Why is she in there?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall master, I&hellip; I also have no idea.&rdquo;<br>Pang Youyang also had a look of confusion.<br>It turned out that that woman was no ordinary female elder at all.<br>She was the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s strongest genius.<br>In fact, she was deemed to be the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s future master.<br>Sooner or later, the position of the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master would be handed to her.<br>She was the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s third daughter, Li Mengyue.<br>&ldquo;That girl, why is she helping Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is she trying to die?&rdquo;<br>A look of anger covered the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s face. However, his eyes were filled with worries.<br>For the sake of obtaining the legendary treasure, his Purple Star Hall should not participate in the struggles between any powers.<br>Because of that, he was worried that his daughter&rsquo;s interference would change the composition of the Purple Star Variance Realm.<br>And, more than that, he was worried about his daughter&rsquo;s safety.<br>After all, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master had already undergone Demonization.<br>His death was certain. With that, who knew what he might do.<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, I&rsquo;ll go and bring back Third Young Miss at once.&rdquo;<br>By the time Pang Youyang&rsquo;s words left his mouth, his figure had disappeared from the palace. He was proceeding toward the Purple Star Variance Realm&rsquo;s entrance.<br>&hellip;...<br>Li Mengyue&rsquo;s appearance surprised everyone.<br>After all, Li Mengyue not only possessed great strength, but she also possessed an extraordinary status.<br>However, even though this exceptionally talented third young miss was a weird individual, she was also extremely proud.<br>Reportedly, her relationship with her siblings wasn't that good.<br>She was a cold figure that almost no one beside the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master could approach.<br>Thus, why would she come to Chu Feng&rsquo;s aid at that moment?<br>Could it be that they were acquainted?<br>What the crowd didn&rsquo;t know was that even Chu Feng was surprised to see Li Mengyue standing before him.<br>Even though Chu Feng was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he had not discovered that she was actually so powerful when he'd interacted with her.<br>She was actually a rank four Utmost Exalted.<br>But, with how she was able to effortlessly block the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master&rsquo;s slash attack, one could tell that she possessed an exceptionally strong battle power that ordinary rank four Utmost Exalteds couldn&rsquo;t possibly compare to. After all, the slash attack had come from the Demonized Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>&ldquo;This matter has nothing to do with you. You should leave,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Li Mengyue.<br>&ldquo;Nothing to do with me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This matter has occurred in our Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s territory.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Things that occur within our Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s territory couldn&rsquo;t possibly be unrelated to our Purple Star Hall.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should leave this matter to me instead. A brat like you should hide behind this big sister and watch how I handle things,&rdquo; after saying those words, Li Mengyue turned her gaze to the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>&ldquo;Hey! Old codger, you know who I am?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Li Mengyue. I&rsquo;m the daughter of the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about you give me face and drop this matter here?&rdquo; Li Mengyue said to the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Scram!&rdquo;<br>Surprisingly, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master refused to give face to Li Mengyue.<br>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re refusing the face that&rsquo;s given to you?&rdquo;<br>Even more surprising, Li Mengyue showed no trace of fear towards the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master&rsquo;s fierce attitude. Instead, her expression changed.<br>The sweet smile disappeared from her face, and was replaced with a fierce expression.<br>&ldquo;A deathwish? Very well, this old man will send you off.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master unleashed his attack.<br>His body shifted and turned into overflowing black flames that rushed straight towards Li Mengyue.<br>As for Li Mengyue, she was not afraid in the slightest. With a flick of her wrist, an Incomplete Exalted Armament appeared in her hand. Then, she flew towards the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>In the blink of an eye, the two of them collided.<br>That said, even though Li Mengyue possessed extremely strong battle power, she was still forced to retreat repeatedly when confronted with the Demonized Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master. In merely a couple exchanges, she had fallen into a disadvantaged state.<br></p></div>
