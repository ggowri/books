        <div> - The First Manifestation Of Might<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such a powerful Demon Armament in this world? This is simply many times more powerful than even Ancestral Armaments. Chu Feng is actually able to use such a powerful Demon Armament?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng&hellip; exactly what is his origin?&rdquo;<br>As the crowd praised in admiration, they began to ponder Chu Feng&rsquo;s origin again.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you alright?&rdquo;<br>Compared to the overwhelming might emitted by the Evil God Sword, Her Lady Queen was more concerned about Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had officially unleashed the power of the Evil God Sword.<br>&ldquo;For the time being, this sword has yet to go out of control. It has given its power to me, allowing me to use it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I now have a rough sensation of its power. If my guess is correct, I will be able to contend against True Immortals as long as I have it,&rdquo; Chu Feng grew excited.<br>&ldquo;Really? Then quickly activate your<br>Lightning<br>Armor and<br>Lightning<br>Wings to increase your cultivation so that you can kill those Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s old farts,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;No. right now, I have only obtained the strength of the Evil God Sword, and my cultivation isn&rsquo;t really at the True Immortal realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, not only am I unable to use the Heavenly Bloodline&rsquo;s power, I am also unable to use my martial power to unleash my martial skills and secret skills.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng looked at the Evil God Sword he held in his hands, he said, &ldquo;Right now, this sword is the only thing that I can use.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Evil God Sword is the only thing you can use?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen revealed an astonished expression.<br>&ldquo;However, I feel... that this sword by itself is sufficient.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng pointed the Evil God Sword in his hand toward one of the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elders.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>At that moment, a strange and ear-piercing voice sounded. Then, a crimson sword ray was shot directly toward that Supreme Elder.<br>&ldquo;This aura, damn it!&rdquo;<br>Faced with the sword ray unleashed by the Evil God Sword, that Supreme Elder revealed a panic-stricken expression. He simply did not even dare to block the attack. Rather, he immediately moved aside to dodge it.<br>However, Chu Feng did not give up just like that. He continued to brandish his Evil God Sword, and unleashed several sword rays toward that Supreme Elder.<br>&ldquo;Damn!&rdquo;<br>In Such a situation, that Supreme Elder could only try to dodge continuously.<br>It was not that he did not want to fight back. Rather, Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks were simply too fast.<br>Furthermore, it wasn&rsquo;t that he didn&rsquo;t want to block the attacks. Rather, the crimson sword rays emitted by the Evil God Sword were simply too frightening.<br>Those sword rays brought that Supreme Elder a sensation, that... he was simply unable to block them.<br>Thus, he naturally did not dare to block them.<br>In merely a blink of an eye, that Supreme Elder was forced many thousands of meters away by Chu Feng.<br>As for Chu Feng, he did not continue to chase after that Supreme Elder. Rather, he arrived beside Kong Shunlian.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, that sword of yours!!!&rdquo; Kong Shunlian was also astonished by Chu Feng&rsquo;s Evil God Sword.<br>&ldquo;Senior Kong, I will tell you about the origins of this sword in detail in the future.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, we must get through this crisis first. As you&rsquo;re already injured, you should not battle anymore. Leave with Wang Qiang first, I&rsquo;ll handle them,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Kong Shunlian revealed a surprised expression.<br>However, Chu Feng completely disregarded Kong Shunlian&rsquo;s expression.<br>Instead, Chu Feng looked at the mysterious individual and said, &ldquo;Senior, I do not know who you are. However, this Chu Feng is truly thankful that you have placed your life on the line to come to my assistance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Might you be willing to leave me your distinguished name? If this Chu Feng is able to live past today, I will definitely repay senior&rsquo;s kindness today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young Master Chu Feng, this old man is your servant,&rdquo; That mysterious individual said.<br>&ldquo;Servant?&rdquo; The response from that mysterious individual came like a sudden clap of thunder in the hearts of all the crowd present.<br>&ldquo;Servant? That unknown True Immortal actually declared himself to be Chu Feng&rsquo;s servant?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens, a True Immortal-level expert is actually Chu Feng&rsquo;s servant?! Sure enough, Chu Feng possesses an extraordinary origin, a truly extraordinary origin!&rdquo;<br>The word &lsquo;servant&rsquo; was caught by Zhuge Mingren. He immediately cried out in alarm.<br>Once he muttered those words, the rest of the bystanders all heard it too.<br>&ldquo;True Immortal servant?! Chu Feng&rsquo;s servant is a True Immortal?! Heavens! Chu Feng not only possesses such a powerful Demon Armament, what sort of huge monster does Chu Feng have behind his back too?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He is most definitely not someone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. He must be a Young Master from a certain Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Haha, Kong Heavenly Clan&hellip; oh Kong Heavenly Clan, you all have truly met your match now, no?&rdquo;<br>Upon finding out the matter of that True Immortal being Chu Feng&rsquo;s servant, the crowd was completely astonished. However, they all burst into laughter too.<br>They were all people standing on Chu Feng&rsquo;s side. Thus, to them, this news was extremely great.<br>At that moment, they were all certain that Chu Feng was not someone from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>Although there were indeed some hidden True Immortal-level experts in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, they were all proud and arrogant individuals, and would definitely refuse to submit to others as servants.<br>Thus, merely from one word from that mysterious True Immortal, the crowd was certain that Chu Feng must be someone from an Upper Realm.<br>As for the Upper Realms&rsquo; huge monsters, how could a mere Kong Heavenly Clan possibly contend against them?<br>At that moment, everyone felt that the Kong Heavenly Clan had kicked an iron plate, that they would definitely suffer enormously in the future.<br>In fact, even the destruction of their Kong Heavenly Clan was possible.<br>&ldquo;Servant?&rdquo;<br>In fact, Chu Feng was also very astonished right now. No matter how hard he thought about it, he was unable to think of a True Immortal-level servant.<br>&ldquo;Senior, regardless of who you might be, I still thank you for your grace today. However, what happened here today is caused by me, Chu Feng. As such, I truly do not wish to implicate you. Thus&hellip; please leave too. You can leave the rest to me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Kong Shunlian&rsquo;s expression grew increasingly shocked. He simply did not dare to believe his own ears.<br>Chu Feng was actually planning to take on three True Immortals by himself?<br>&ldquo;What shameless boasting. Do you really think that you can contend against True Immortals with a mere weapon?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will let you experience exactly how powerful the might of a True Immortal is right now.&rdquo;<br>The remaining Supreme Elder who was fighting against Kong Shunlian grew extremely furious and rushed to attack Chu Feng.<br>He brandished the Ancestral Armament he held in his hand and shot a slash toward Chu Feng.<br>That slash was no ordinary attack. Rather, it was a martial skill, an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill.<br>A True Immortal unleashing an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill with an Ancestral Armament, oh how powerful must that be?<br>It was so frighteningly powerful that even Kong Shunlian, a fellow True Immortal, would not dare be careless toward it. Kong Shunlian raised his Ancestral Armament with the intention of blocking that attack.<br>However, right at the moment when Kong Shunlian was about to act, Chu Feng suddenly thrust forth his Evil God Sword.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>A crimson sword ray was once again shot forth from Chu Feng&rsquo;s Evil God Sword.<br>The very next moment, the crimson sword ray collided with the Emperor Taboo Martial Skill unleashed by the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder.<br>To the crowd&rsquo;s astonishment, the collision did not end in a loud explosion, nor did it create energy ripples wreaking havoc through the surroundings.<br>Instead, like a stream assimilating into the sea, it quietly and completely disappeared.<br>That&rsquo;s right, it was like a stream assimilating into the sea.<br>That Supreme Elder&rsquo;s Emperor Taboo Martial Skill was devoured, devoured by the Evil God Sword&rsquo;s sword ray.<br>At that moment, not only did that crimson sword ray not grow weaker, it instead became more powerful than before.<br>That scene stunned everyone present.<br>One should know&hellip; that the people involved, with the exception of Chu Feng and Wang Qiang, were all True Immortals.<br>When even True Immortals were stunned, one could tell how astonishing what had just happened was.<br><br></p></div>
