        <h1>Chapter 3849</h1>
        <div> - Practically A Benefactor<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Mystic Cave Saints, since you have lost, you should honor your promise, no?&rdquo; said the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured. We, the Mystic Cave Saints, have always kept our word.&rdquo; as the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints spoke, he took out the Yin-Yang Soulsealing Rope.<br>However, he did not directly hand it to the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster. Instead, he first looked to Chu Feng with a bitter and grude-filled gaze.<br>&ldquo;Fuck it all! Never would I have expected that I&rsquo;d be screwed by you again, damned brat.&rdquo; the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; Eldest said with great displeasure.<br>After he finished saying those words, he flipped his sleeve and threw the Yin-Yang Soulsealing Rope to the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>&ldquo;Do you want to have another go?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the Mystic Cave Saints with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Another go my ass. Little brat, I&rsquo;ve remembered you.&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints with great displeasure.<br>&ldquo;Since the outcome has been decided, you all can leave." said the elders of the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>This was actually the first time they&rsquo;d met the Mystic Cave Saints in the flesh.<br>In the past, they&rsquo;d only heard rumors about them. Only their Lady Headmaster had been in direct contact with them.<br>At that moment, the Mystic Cave Saints had left a very deep impression on them.<br>It was precisely because of that deep impression that they wanted the Mystic Cave Saints to scram out of their Red-dress Holy Land right away.<br>In fact, merely having them scram was already being very polite and courteous.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for taking etiquette into consideration, they would&rsquo;ve rushed out to teach them a lesson by beating them up, and then kicking them out afterwards.<br>After all, the Mystic Cave Saints were simply too shameless.<br>Fortunately Chu Feng had been present. Otherwise, they would&rsquo;ve suffered major losses.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, even if you all wanted to keep us here, we would not stay in your lousy place. We shall never meet again." The Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; Eldest prepared to leave after saying those words.<br>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; The Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster spoke all of a sudden.<br>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could you be planning to restrain us here, and then handing us over to Yuan Shu?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let me tell you this explicitly. It was not us who cheated to get into the World Spirit Mansion Gate. You should not believe that little brat&rsquo;s framing of us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you all insist on believing him and falsely accusing us, I will tell you this&hellip; we, the Mystic Cave Saints, are not so easily bullied." said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken. That is not my intention.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As the saying goes, those who come are guests. Since you all have come here, we, the Red-dress Holy Land, shall naturally act as hosts, and treat you all with due respect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone, why don&rsquo;t you stay in our Red-dress Holy Land for several more days?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Red-dress Holy Land just so happens to possess several treasures related to world spirit techniques that we would like to ask Grandmasters to help decipher.&rdquo; said the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>Chu Feng noticed that the Mystic Cave Saints had originally showed no intention of staying. However, once they heard the word &lsquo;treasures.&rsquo; their gazes immediately changed.<br>They all turned their gazes to their Eldest brother, and were seemingly waiting for him to make a decision.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Although your Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders truly lack manners, they are, in the end, only elders. We will not lower ourselves to their level.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since Headmaster Red-dress intends to invite us to stay as guests, we will naturally have to give Headmaster Red-dress face,&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>Once he said those words, the expressions of the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders all turned very ugly.<br>Even Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from cursing the Mystic Cave Saints for being shameless in his heart.<br>He had clearly stated that they would not stay even if the Red-dress Holy Land invited them to stay. Yet, right after the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster spoke, they immediately decided to stay.<br>Even though Chu Feng knew that they were only interested in the treasures that the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster spoke of, their skin was still simply too thick.<br>That being said, the curtains had finally dropped on the matter.<br>Being miserably defeated, Zhang Duotuo found it embarrassing to continue to stay around.<br>He found it even more embarrassing to mention the marriage again.<br>Because of that, he had taken Meng Rufei and left with his tail between his legs on the same day.<br>The Red-dress Holy Land did not have any intention to urge him to stay either.<br>After all, if it wasn&rsquo;t for Chu Feng&rsquo;s help, they would have suffered major losses all because of Zhang Duotuo.<br>As for Chu Feng, due to his involvement and winning twice against all odds, allowing the Red-dress Holy Land to become the final victor in the gamble, he became someone who had contributed great merit to the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Unavoidably, the Red-dress Holy Land prepared a major feast and an ample amount of gifts to express their thanks to him.<br>All of the elders were present at the feast. Even the elite disciples were present. Naturally, Yin Zhuanghong and the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster were also present.<br>One thing worthy of mentioning was that the Mystic Cave Saints were actually also present.<br>Furthermore, they arrived unsolicited, and were eating and drinking with glee. It was as if they were the main characters of the feast.<br>It truly must be said that they possessed extremely thick skin.<br>After the feast, the Mystic Cave Saints really ended up staying in the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>That said, Chu Feng did not have any interactions with them. Thus, he was rather indifferent to the matter of them staying.<br>Chu Feng felt that the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster&rsquo;s decision to have the Mystic Cave Saints, dangerous as they might be stay, was most definitely not because of needing their help for simply deciphering some treasures.<br>After all, if she needed help to decipher treasures, she could very much ask for Chu Feng&rsquo;s help. There was simply no need to request the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; help.<br>The Mystic Cave Saints were completely devoid of morality and baseline. Their eyes had shone upon hearing the word &lsquo;treasures.&rsquo;<br>As the ruler of the Red-dress Holy Land, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster couldn&rsquo;t possibly not know how dangerous the Mystic Cave Saints were. Asking them to stay was simply akin to inviting tigers into one&rsquo;s home.<br>Thus, Chu Feng suspected that the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster must have her own reason as to why she wanted the Mystic Cave Saints to stay. Merely, he had no idea what her reason was.<br>That being said, after that day, Chu Feng&rsquo;s treatment in the Red-dress Holy Land had changed enormously.<br>In the past, Lil Xin was the only one who would bring him dimsum every day, and Yin Zhuanghong was the only person who would come to see him every day.<br>However, after Chu Feng defeated the Mystic Cave Saints, the elders of the Red-dress Holy Land came to pay him a visit every day.<br>In fact, even the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster would occasionally visit him.<br>Most amusing of all, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders would sometimes bring their own personal disciples to pay Chu Feng a visit.<br>Although they would speak rather ambiguously, they were implying that they wanted to introduce their disciples to him in the hopes of creating a connection for a potential marriage.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or cry.<br>After all, not every elder&rsquo;s disciple was an outstanding beauty. Some&hellip; were difficult to describe with words...<br>Of course, Chu Feng had no interest in them regardless of their looks.<br>It had been a very long time since he had been attracted to anyone.<br>Ever since he had Zi Ling, Su Rou and Su Mei in his heart&hellip; his heart seemed to be completely full, unable to contain anyone else.<br></p></div>
