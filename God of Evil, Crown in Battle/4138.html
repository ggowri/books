        <div> - Taking On Disasters Together<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Elder Hanxun, is it possible to unseal the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation?&rdquo; asked the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>One could even hear the sound of him grinding his teeth as he spoke.<br>He was at the end of his patience. He wanted to personally set off to kill Chu Feng.<br>Unfortunately, the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation was simply too powerful. It was impossible for him to charge inside.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, once the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation is activated, one can only wait for its power to dissipate on its own. It is impossible to unseal it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation is only able to stop us. If we are to use this, people of the younger generation within a hundred years old would be able to enter it.&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Hanxun took out a title plate as he spoke.<br>That title plate was made of stone.<br>That stone title plate gave off an identical aura to the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>It was as if the title plate and the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation were one.<br>After taking out the title plate, Zuoqiu Hanxun looked to Zuoqiu Daoyi.<br>Although Zuoqiu Daoyi&rsquo;s talent was inferior to Zuoqiu Tiancheng&rsquo;s, he was still a fully-deserving genius.<br>Not only was he still a person of the younger generation, but he also possessed the cultivation of rank three Utmost Exalted.<br>In this situation where the majority of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen would not be able to rescue Zuoqiu Tiancheng, Zuoqiu Daoyi became the only candidate capable of rescuing him.<br>&ldquo;Daoyi, are you confident?&rdquo; The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked Zuoqiu Daoyi.<br>&ldquo;Lord Father, please rest assured. Once I enter, I definitely won't allow Chu Feng to leave alive.&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Daoyi took the title plate as he spoke.<br>&ldquo;Bring him back alive. I will make him wish he was dead,&rdquo; said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;As you desire,&rdquo; Zuoqiu Daoyi answered.<br>With that, he was ready to enter the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>However, before he could enter, Zuoqiu Hanxun stopped him.<br>He was holding a Cosmos Sack in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Young master Daoyi, just in case, please bring this with you,&rdquo; said Zuoqiu Hanxun.<br>&ldquo;Hah&hellip;.&rdquo;<br>After seeing the Cosmos Sack, Zuoqiu Daoyi suddenly laughed.<br>He recognized that Cosmos Sack, and knew what was inside.<br>It had originally been prepared for Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>What was inside the Cosmos Sack could not help Zuoqiu Tiancheng withstand the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>However, it was able to help him increase his battle power inside it.<br>Unfortunately, Zuoqiu Tiancheng had felt that there was no need to use it, since he&rsquo;d be fighting against Chu Feng who wouldn't be able to use his world spirit techniques, and had not brought it with him.<br>Zuoqiu Daoyi was confident that he would be able to defeat Chu Feng with his own strength.<br>As such, he felt even more unwilling to use it.<br>Zuoqiu Hanxun knew Zuoqiu Daoyi&rsquo;s strength very well.<br>Because of that, Zuoqiu Daoyi felt that he was being humiliated when Zuoqiu Hanxun handed the Cosmos Sack to him.<br>&ldquo;Elder Hanxun, even my younger brother said there&rsquo;s no need for that. Yet, you want me to take it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you perhaps think that I won&rsquo;t be a match for that Chu Feng?&rdquo; asked Zuoqiu Daoyi.<br>&ldquo;Young master Daoyi, that is not what this old man is implying at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a safety measure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation might disintegrate at any moment.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t use it, there won&rsquo;t be another chance to use it. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a complete waste then?&rdquo; said Zuoqiu Hanxun.<br>Zuoqiu Daoyi became even more displeased upon hearing those words.<br>He thought to himself, &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t say anything when my younger brother refused to take it, yet you have so many reasons when I refuse to take it.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it obvious that you&rsquo;re looking down on me?&rsquo;<br>Although the relationship between Zuoqiu Daoyi and Zuoqiu Tiancheng was pretty good, people would inevitably have times when they felt insecure.<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan had spent an enormous financial sum and exhausted countless treasures so that they could activate the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation. They didn&rsquo;t do that for him, Zuoqiu Daoyi. Instead, they had done it for his brother, Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>In fact, Zuoqiu Daoyi knew very well that the future clan chief would be his younger brother, not him.<br>However, things hadn't been like that at the start.<br>At first, Zuoqiu Daoyi had been a giant among men.<br>He had been the hope of their Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan.<br>He was the person that would succeed their father as the future Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>But, as his younger brother Zuoqiu Tiancheng grew up, as his talent was revealed to the world, everything began to change.<br>Especially after Zuoqiu Tiancheng learned the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. Everything had changed completely.<br>Even though he still had a cultivation that was superior to his younger brothers, he was no longer viewed as their clan&rsquo;s strongest genius in the eyes of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen. The title of the strongest genius had shifted to his younger brother, Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>Even though he appeared to have accepted the reality, he actually felt immense dissatisfaction in his heart.<br>Because of that, he had worked extra hard in his training. It was all so that he would not be overtaken by his younger brother.<br>He was fighting for himself.<br>He was proving with his accomplishments that he was still the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s strongest genius.<br>As such, since his younger brother felt it to be beneath his dignity to use that item, he would naturally also feel the same.<br>&ldquo;Just take it. It would be best if you don&rsquo;t have to use it,&rdquo; right at that moment, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief suddenly spoke.<br>Zuoqiu Daoyi was immediately stunned upon hearing those words. He found himself caught in a very difficult position.<br>Even though he felt an endless unwillingness in his heart, he did not dare to go against his father.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Lord Father.&rdquo;<br>In the end, he accepted the cosmos sack and placed it in his bosom.<br>Then, Zuoqiu Daoyi arrived before the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation with the stone title plate in his hand.<br>After the stone title plate was placed on the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation, it immediately disappeared. Zuoqiu Daoyi also disappeared with it.<br>When Zuoqiu Daoyi appeared again he was inside the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>After entering the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation, he saw Chu Feng torturing his younger brother at close range.<br>Whilst he felt pain from seeing the torture his younger brother was suffering, Zuoqiu Daoyi also felt somewhat refreshed.<br>However, he knew that he could not linger for long.<br>After all, his father was watching him.<br>As such, Zuoqiu Daoyi spoke, &ldquo;Chu Feng, kneel and beg for forgiveness right now. Do that, and I will consider letting you live for a while longer.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had been fully immersed in torturing Zuoqiu Tiancheng. As a result he'd only realized that Zuoqiu Daoyi had entered after hearing his voice.<br>&ldquo;Another one.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You two are truly brothers willing to face disasters together,&rdquo; laughed Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words, Zuoqiu Daoyi narrowed his brows.<br>&lsquo;Even you, someone who doesn't know me, thinks that I&rsquo;m the same as my younger brother?&rsquo;<br>With this thought in his mind, the anger in Zuoqiu Daoyi&rsquo;s heart surged violently.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Zuoqiu Daoyi moved.<br>He did not bother with superfluous words, and also did not unleash his martial power.<br>Using the most primitive method, he shot towards Chu Feng.<br>His speed was extremely fast, and he arrived before Chu Feng in the blink of an eye.<br>With his palm held like a blade, he cut through the air and thrust toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s dantian.<br>Although his father had told him to keep Chu Feng alive, he felt that it would do as long as Chu Feng was barely alive. There was no need to keep his cultivation intact.<br>Most importantly, he was determined to prove himself to all of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>He wanted to show them that, under the same cultivation, his battle power surpassed his younger brother&rsquo;s.<br>The result of his attack was what he desired. He had successfully struck Chu Feng&rsquo;s dantian.<br>However, when his palm had finally struck Chu Feng&rsquo;s dantian, he was suddenly stunned.<br>Not even Chu Feng&rsquo;s clothes had been damaged by his palm thrust. Instead, it was his fingers that had ended up becoming badly mangled and broken.<br>It was as if his hand had struck a steel plate.<br>The impact from the thrust had completely mutilated his fingers.<br></p></div>
