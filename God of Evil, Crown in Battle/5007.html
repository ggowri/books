        <h1>Chapter 5006</h1>
        <div>: Infusing the Netherworld Embryo Into the Soul<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The grounds shattered and mountains collapsed. Even the forest in the distance started toppling over. Black smoke puffed into the sky as though signaling the arrival of doomsday.<br>It looked like the world would collapse at this rate, and it was all because of the rampaging black gaseous flames and martial power.<br>The two forces intersected with each other, creating massive devastation. Were it not for those crossing blows intentionally holding back, even the shockwaves would have been enough to obliterate Chu Feng and the others.<br>Both the Netherworld Envoy and the little girl were exerting strength that surpassed Martial Exalted level. Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t tell for sure how powerful they were, but they had to be at Half-God level at the very least.<br>Even powerhouses like Shengguang Baimei, the Godwish Grandmother, and the others felt utterly insignificant before such force.<br>This was how merciless the world of cultivation was. Those who stood on higher grounds could easily dictate the life and death of those beneath them.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you recognize that little girl?&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother asked with irreconcilable astonishment on her face.<br>The others were also curious about it too. They could tell that the little girl was the &lsquo;being&rsquo; whom the Netherworld Envoy was trying to capture, and it was likely that she had been hiding in this Ordinary Realm for a very long time. The only reason why she had chosen to appear at a moment like this was to save Chu Feng.<br>But how did Chu Feng get acquainted with such a terrifying individual?<br>The aura that was emanated by that little girl was so terrifying that it deeply intimidated them. Even if she was a monstrous beast, there was no way she was any ordinary monstrous beast.<br>&ldquo;I have met her once before, but we hardly interacted at all. I don&rsquo;t know why she has chosen to step forward to save me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a look of confusion.<br>&ldquo;Where did you meet her? I don&rsquo;t think that she&rsquo;s human. Do you know what she is?&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother asked.<br>&ldquo;I met her back in the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. I&rsquo;m not sure whether she&rsquo;s human or not, but she has been rather friendly to me all this while.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could still remember his first encounter with the little girl. The latter had also demonstrated terrifying strength and killing intent, but she held herself back due to him.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not bother about who she is right now. We need to get out of here right now while she&rsquo;s keeping the Netherworld Envoy busy!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei exclaimed.<br>He didn&rsquo;t think that they were out of danger yet. It was one thing if the little girl won the battle, but what if she lost?<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you leave first. I&rsquo;ll find a way to contact you later on,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother said.<br>She had chosen to stay here before she dared not to offend the Netherworld Envoy. After all, Song Yun was going to join the Netherworld Sect, which would put her under the care of the Netherworld Envoy.<br>&ldquo;Take care, elder.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng understood where the Godwish Grandmother was coming from, so he didn&rsquo;t say anything about that. He turned his sights toward Shengguang Baimei, and the latter immediately caught his drift. Without any hesitation, he wrapped Chu Feng and Daoist Niantian in his martial power and began rushing off.<br>The Lady of Dao Sea quickly followed them.<br>She still remembered the mission the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had entrusted to her, so she chose to leave with Chu Feng instead of staying behind with the Godwish Grandmother.<br>Even as Chu Feng and the others left, they couldn&rsquo;t help but sneak glances backward with worried looks on their faces. The clash between the Netherworld Envoy and the little girl was simply too intense.<br>Despite Shengguang Baimei&rsquo;s swift movement speed&mdash;the surroundings were literally zipping past them&mdash;the massive congregations of gaseous flames and martial power remained well within sight.<br>Most likely, the gaseous flames and martial power would remain visible no matter where they escaped to in this Ordinary Realm. That was how huge they were.<br>&ldquo;So this is the strength of a Half-God. I never thought that I would encounter experts of such caliber in the Eastern Region. Shit! I feel like utter trash before them,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei cursed under his breath as he continued rushing toward the teleportation formation.<br>He was both awed and fearful of the prowess displayed by the Half-Gods. It was the same for the others too.<br>On the other hand, Chu Feng was feeling apologetic. He wasn&rsquo;t close with the little girl, but the latter had only come out of her hiding in order to protect him. Yet, he was turning his back on her right now, abandoning her.<br>While he was powerless to do anything, he still felt deeply guilt-ridden about it.<br>Weng!<br>All of a sudden, the scenery that was still zipping them by a moment ago came to a halt. To be more exact, it was Shengguang Baimei who had stopped moving.<br>A force was holding him in place.<br>&ldquo;Where do you think you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo; a voice echoed ahead of them.<br>Chu Feng and the others looked frontward and immediately realized that the situation had turned awry.<br>The person who was blocking their path was none other than the Netherworld Envoy. The little girl was lying unconscious over his shoulders with blood trialing from her lips.<br>It was clear who the victor of the battle was.<br>As powerful as the little girl was, she wasn&rsquo;t a match for the Netherworld Envoy. This sight left Chu Feng feeling even more conscience-stricken.<br>The little girl must have chosen to hide because she knew that she wasn&rsquo;t a match for the Netherworld Envoy. She could have made her escape after the formation sealing off the entire Ordinary Realm was lifted, but she ended up getting captured in a bid to save Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll accept anything you wish to do to me, but can you let her off?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Child, you don&rsquo;t have any say over this matter. Besides, this is good news for the two of you. You&rsquo;ll have a chance to join our Netherworld Sect, and you&rsquo;ll thank me for that in the future,&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy replied.<br>He whipped out his dagger and began approaching Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I am Shengguang Baimei from the Holy Valley. Young friend Chu Feng is the benefactor of our Holy Valley. If you dare to hurt him, our Holy Monarch will hunt you down and kill you!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei uttered threats.<br>However, the Netherworld Envoy turned a deaf ear to those words and walked right past Shengguang Baimei. Using the dagger, he slit an incision in Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead.<br>This time, there was no one else who could step in to save him. Chu Feng could only watch helplessly as everything happened.<br>He could clearly feel something opening up his forehead, but the mysterious dagger inhibited his sense of pain.<br>Following that, the Netherworld Envoy took out the Netherworld Embryo and inserted it into his head. To be more exact, it was inserted into his soul.<br>A bizarre power emanated from the Netherworld Embryo, threatening to devour Chu Feng&rsquo;s entire soul. However, the bizarre power soon started receding before vanishing altogether. Fortunately, there was no other side effect other than that.<br>Meanwhile, the Netherworld Envoy erased Chu Feng&rsquo;s wound with a wave of his hand. He continued to stare at Chu Feng intently, seemingly worried that he would suffer a backlash.<br></p></div>
