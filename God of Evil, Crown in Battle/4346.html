        <h1>Chapter 4345</h1>
        <div>: Master Is Going To Die?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Ox-nosed Old Daoist began setting up a formation in order to manipulate the divine energy in the air.<br>Even though Chu Feng was some distance away, through his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, he was still able to see the situation the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was in clearly.<br>The energy released by the Qilin&rsquo;s egg grew stronger and stronger, such that the situation was swiftly becoming more and more precarious.<br>On the other hand, however, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was no longer shoved aside by the pulses of energy anymore. He had begun working on setting up a double-layered formation simultaneously.<br>The first layer of the formation served to fend away the energy that was being released by the Qilin&rsquo;s egg, and the second layer was to channel the divine energy in the air to suppress the Qilin&rsquo;s egg.<br>It was just that the formation that was used to suppress the Qilin&rsquo;s egg was extremely difficult to set up. Even someone of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s caliber was unable to do it within a short span of time.<br>As time ticked by, Chu Feng noticed that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s face had not only turned pale, but blood was even flowing out of his seven apertures.<br>Following that, cracks began appearing all over his body, and blood seeped out from those cracks too.<br>Seeing the state of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, words couldn&rsquo;t begin to describe just how worried Chu Feng was.<br>But before Chu Feng could even make a move, the voice of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had already sounded in the air. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come over, or else everything will be in vain! Both you and I will die!&rdquo;<br>Given the current situation, no matter how worried Chu Feng was, he had no choice but to hide in a corner. There was nothing he could do to help at all.<br>Soon, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was completely cloaked in a layer of blood, and lacerations could be seen all over his body. His aura was beginning to wither as well.<br>Time seemed to go by extremely slowly in a situation like this.<br>Chu Feng really couldn&rsquo;t tell how long the Ox-nosed Old Daoist could hold on in his current state.<br>Weng!<br>However, after three hours that felt like an eternity, a ray of hope finally arrived.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had successfully set up the formation to suppress the Qilin&rsquo;s egg.<br>The powerful formation enveloped large swathes of land after forming before abruptly contracting on the Qilin&rsquo;s egg, pouring its energy into it.<br>In an instant, the pulsations of energy from the Qilin&rsquo;s egg stopped altogether, and runes and symbols appeared on its surface.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, come here.&rdquo;<br>It was only when the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said those words that Chu Feng dared to head back to where the Qilin&rsquo;s egg was.<br>&ldquo;Infuse your energy into the Qilin&rsquo;s egg,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>Not daring to hesitate for even the slightest moment, he quickly carried out the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s instructions and infused his energy into the Qilin&rsquo;s egg.<br>As soon as he infused his energy, he could feel a unique connection being forged between him and the Qilin&rsquo;s egg.<br>It was just that this connection felt a little bizarre and unnatural to him. It was very different from the connection he had with his world spirits.<br>&ldquo;Release formation!&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng infused his energy into the Qilin&rsquo;s egg, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist bellowed loudly, and that divine yet powerful formation that was sealing off the Qilin&rsquo;s egg vanished without a trace.<br>It was just that the Qilin&rsquo;s egg no longer rampaged as it did before. In fact, it seemed to be even quieter than before.<br>On the other hand, however, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist fell backward and collapsed to the floor on his bottom.<br>&ldquo;Master!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng immediately rushed forward and used his spirit power to treat the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>But to his shock, he found himself utterly helpless before the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s current condition.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing much. I just need to rest for a while.&rdquo;<br>Even though the Ox-nosed Old Daoist claimed that he was fine, blood was still trickling down his face and body. He looked like a severely injured individual who was already standing before death&rsquo;s door.<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but feel his heart ache watching such a sight.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, that Qilin won&rsquo;t break out of its egg for the time being under the effects of the formation. Even if it does so, under the effects of the formation, it won&rsquo;t be able to hurt you either. However, this formation only prevents it from hurting you. You still won&rsquo;t be able to control it yet.<br>&ldquo;This Qilin will surely become a formidable beast in the future. Even if it doesn&rsquo;t become a Divine Beast, it won&rsquo;t be too much weaker than them. If you could use it well, it&rsquo;ll surely become a powerful aid to you in the future,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Master, I didn&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;d have to pay such a heavy price to set up this formation. If only I had known, I would have thrown this Qilin&rsquo;s egg away a long time ago!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt deeply guilty inside. He didn&rsquo;t expect that this matter would deal such a heavy blow to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>The entire time, he could only stare helplessly by the side as the Ox-nosed Old Daoist grew weaker and weaker.<br>&ldquo;This has nothing to do with you. My old wounds are simply relapsing. Your master is, after all, a person who has died once before. The body I&rsquo;m currently in is incomplete, so whenever I set up overly powerful formations, my body will tear open.<br>&ldquo;I know that it might look painful to you, but in truth&hellip; Yeah, it&rsquo;s actually that painful. Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Speaking up to this point, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist burst into laughter.<br>Even though it might seem like he was joking, Chu Feng could tell that he wasn&rsquo;t kidding around when he said those words.<br>&ldquo;Master, I&rsquo;ll avenge you. I&rsquo;ll make the Dao Enlightenment Sage Exalted and Sima Xiangtu experience the pain you felt a thousand times over,&rdquo; Chu Feng said determinedly.<br>&ldquo;Good. As expected of my good disciple! I believe that you&rsquo;ll definitely do it one day. It&rsquo;s just a pity that I might not be there when that day comes,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Master, you&hellip; What are you saying?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt a clench in his heart when he heard those words from his master. An ominous premonition loomed in his heart.<br>&ldquo;My incomplete body won&rsquo;t be able to hold on for too long. Perhaps suppressing that egg might be the last thing I&rsquo;ll ever do for you as your master,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said with a light smile.<br>But Chu Feng felt a sour feeling in his nose when he saw the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s smile, and his eyes grew a little moist.<br>There was a trace of bitterness on the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s smile. It was a smile filled with helplessness and powerlessness.<br>This drove in the fact for Chu Feng that his master really wasn&rsquo;t kidding around. His master&rsquo;s days were truly numbered&hellip;<br></p></div>
