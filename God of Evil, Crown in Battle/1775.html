        <div> - Believe In Chu Feng<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Seeing Chu Feng acting in this sort of manner, a serious expression flashed through Yan Xie&rsquo;s eyes. This was the first time that Chu Feng had stopped since he had entered.<br>Upon closer inspection, Yan Xie discovered that the path ahead was covered by many enormous trees that reached the sky. There was only a single path which could be taken.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how do you know that this is the final hurdle?&rdquo; Yan Xie asked in a puzzled manner. He did not discover any danger in the little pathway through the forest.<br>&ldquo;Trust me. The other end of this pathway will be the center of the fort. However, you must definitely follow me closely. Otherwise, you must distance yourself from me. The further away you distance yourself from me, the better it would be. In fact, distance yourself from me before we enter.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng said those words, he began to walk forward. He did not use any movement martial skills. Instead, he slowly walked forward with a normal pace.<br>Yan Xie was confused by what Chu Feng meant by those words. However, he would naturally not distance himself from Chu Feng. Thus, he hurriedly followed Chu Feng in.<br>After they entered, other than seeing the dense tree branches and leaves that blocked the sunshine, being covered with special spirit formations that made them indestructible, Yan Xie did not discover anything unusual.<br>Dangerous? He was unable to find any trace of danger at all.<br>Yan Xie was truly confused as to why Chu Feng would be so carefree toward those dangerous hurdles, yet extremely cautious in this place.<br>&ldquo;Huu~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Huu~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Huu~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Huu~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Huu~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, dazzling golden-light shot forth from the dark depths of the forest. Upon closer inspection, a total of five golden rays of light were surging toward them with roaring wind like five golden dragons.<br>At this moment, Yan Xie and the others were all alarmed. They finally realized what Chu Feng had meant.<br>Those five golden rays of light were five streams of oppressive might, five visible rays of oppressive might. At this moment, they were coming to crush Chu Feng, Yan Xie, Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish.<br>All five of these rays of oppressive might were extremely powerful. Furthermore, they were not aimed at a single person. Rather, the five of them were aimed at Chu Feng and the others respectively.<br>In other words, the number of rays of oppressive might that this place would release was based upon the number of people present.<br>However, most importantly, these rays of oppressive might were so powerful that, not to mention Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish, even Yan Xie felt an enormous pressure from them.<br>While the rays were was not strong enough to injure Yan Xie, if one were to descend on him, it would cause him to feel enormous pressure and make it very difficult for him to walk onward. His speed would diminish enormously, and he would end up using a lot of physical strength.<br>However, if those rays of oppressive might were to land on Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish, the three of them would definitely explode on the spot and die without a soul or body remaining.<br>Chu Feng had Yan Xie stay close to him. It was evident that Chu Feng was planning to withstand all five streams of oppressive might by himself.<br>&ldquo;Haaahh~~~&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, Chu Feng suddenly shouted. Then, his<br>Lightning<br>Armor and<br>Lightning<br>Wings appeared, and lightning covered his body. Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura also instantly increased from rank seven Half Martial Emperor to rank nine Half Martial Emperor.<br>At the same time as he increased his cultivation to rank nine Half Martial Emperor, Chu Feng had also unleashed his strongest defensive technique --- the Black Tortoise Armor Technique.<br>&ldquo;Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom~~~&rdquo;<br>The five rays of oppressive might crashed into Chu Feng simultaneously. Ear-piercing rumbles were instantly heard. Even the indestructible trees in their surroundings began to sway left and right from the aftermath of the oppressive might&rsquo;s descent. The trees actually began to fracture and emit cracking sounds.<br>However, even though their surroundings were as frightening as hell, Yan Xie and the others who were close to Chu Feng were not affected in the slightest.<br>They felt a sense of comfort, as if they had found refuge among howling winds and torrential rain.<br>&ldquo;Gulp~~~&rdquo;<br>As they saw Chu Feng, whose body was covered with flickering bolts of lightning, Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish all gulped down a mouthful of saliva. They were truly awed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s enormous display of strength.<br>Chu Feng really did possess the power that he was rumored to have, and could instantly increase his cultivation by two levels.<br>In other words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was not only that of a rank seven Half Martial Emperor. Instead, he was a rank nine Half Martial Emperor.<br>Although Chu Feng possessed a similar age to them, and in fact, he was even a bit younger than Chili Pepper and Big Radish, he was already a rank nine Half Martial Emperor, while Chili Pepper and Big Radish were still only Martial Kings.<br>Chu Feng was only a bit away from entering the Martial Emperor realm and becoming a supreme Martial Emperor-level expert.<br>As such, how could they not be in awe and shock? The enormous gap between them had caused them to feel extremely complicated. However, their feelings could be described with a single word: stunned.<br>They were all stunned by Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>Right at this moment, Yan Xie suddenly said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, are you really able to do this? If not, I can go out.&rdquo;<br>Originally, Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish were overwhelmed by shock at how powerful Chu Feng, was and did not notice anything wrong with the current situation. However, after hearing what Yan Xie said, they were immediately baffled and began to feel an indescribable sort of uneasiness.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I can still withstand this,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled.<br>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Yan Xie did not believe Chu Feng.<br>Even though Chu Feng had not revealed that anything was wrong with him, Yan Xie was able to sense how powerful those five streams of oppressive might were.<br>If the five rays of oppressive might were to split apart, Yan Xie would be able to withstand one of them.<br>However, if the five rays of oppressive might were gathered together, their combined power would be five times as enormous. Before such oppressive might, even Yan Xie would be extremely fearful. At the very least, he would not be able to withstand them, and might actually die because of them.<br>Thus, even though Chu Feng appeared to be fine, Yan Xie was still worried for him.<br>At this time, Yan Xie had realized why that mysterious middle-aged man had warned them to not bring others with them when trying to crash through the hurdles.<br>The reason for that was because if one wished to bring anyone with them to take on the hurdle that they were undergoing right now, its difficulty would increase as many times as the number of people there were.<br>At this moment, they were only able to pass through because the person undergoing this was Chu Feng. If it were anyone else, they would definitely not be able to withstand the combined power of five oppressive mights.<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Chu Feng continued to smile.<br>&ldquo;However, these five oppressive mights being gathered at one location is truly too frightening. I think it&rsquo;s better that I step out.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I am to step out, the oppressive might that has come for me will also follow me away.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although it will not help you enormously, it will at least lessen the pressure on you by one fifth,&rdquo; Yan Xie still didn&rsquo;t trust Chu Feng. As he spoke, he planned to exit Chu Feng&rsquo;s defensive barrier.<br>&ldquo;Brother Yan Xie, this place is no ordinary spirit formation. This place is not as simple as it seems to be. If you are to insist on leaving now, not only will you not be able to help me, you will instead bring harm to Chili Pepper, Big Radish, Little Radish and me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for you, you will also be met with death,&rdquo; Chu Feng said seriously.<br>&ldquo;Taa~~~&rdquo;<br>After hearing those words from Chu Feng, Yan Xie&rsquo;s body stiffened. It was as if he had been struck by lightning.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words had given him a sudden realization!!!!<br>The five oppressive mights had already fused together. If he were to leave Chu Feng&rsquo;s defensive barrier, what would attack him would not be a single ray of oppressive might. Instead, it would be five. As such, how could he possibly withstand them?<br>Furthermore, it was very possible for other changes to occur at that time. He might even really bring harm to Chu Feng and the others. Perhaps Chu Feng would be fine. However, Chili Pepper, Big Radish, and Little Radish would definitely die.<br>Thinking of those things, Yan Xie smiled a self-mocking smile. He finally realized how stupid he was being. Furthermore, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Chu Feng stopping him, he would&rsquo;ve brought about his own death and harmed his friends due to his stupidity.<br>&ldquo;Trust me. Although this place is dangerous, it&rsquo;s still within my ability to withstand. I will be able to safely bring you all over,&rdquo; Seeing Yan Xie&rsquo;s mood growing gloomy, Chu Feng smiled and patted Yan Xie&rsquo;s shoulder.<br>Yan Xie raised his head and looked to Chu Feng, who was worried about him and had a smile on his face. Yan Xie smiled again. This time around, Yan Xie&rsquo;s smile was one of feeling relieved.<br>Yan Xie finally realized how enormous the gap between him and Chu Feng was. This gap was not only a gap between their talents. He had discovered that, even in other aspects, he was greatly inferior to Chu Feng.<br>Before such a Chu Feng, there was simply no need for him to worry. After all, there was nothing he could do to help Chu Feng. The only thing he could do now was to put his trust in Chu Feng.<br>He had to believe that Chu Feng would be able to pass through this trial while bringing them with him.<br></p></div>
