        <h1>Chapter 3726</h1>
        <div> - The Injured Old Daoist<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;But senior, you clearly like and have feelings for senior Chu Xuanzhengfa,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;So what if I do? It is one thing to like someone and have feelings for them, but it&rsquo;s another thing to acknowledge and approve of that person.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Gu Mingyuan, would rather marry someone that I acknowledge than marry someone weaker than me that I like and have feelings for.&rdquo; said Gu Mingyuan.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng no longer knew how to persuade Gu Mingyuan. He was able to tell that she was extremely determined.<br>Furthermore, he knew that this was a matter between Gu Mingyuan and Chu Xuanzhengfa, While he could offer simple words of persuasion, he was unqualified to meddle in their business.<br>Thus, in an apologetic manner, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;Senior, this junior was rude. I shouldn&rsquo;t have said these things to senior.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. I know that you&rsquo;re only thinking for our and Lingxi&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, things like affection and feelings are truly not something that one can force one&rsquo;s way with.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Take your father for example&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Gu Mingyuan stopped talking. She forced a smile and shook her head.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng realized something...<br>It was no wonder Gu Mingyuan was so nice to him. It seemed like she had special feelings for his father, even though it seemed like they did not have a close relationship at all.<br>Suddenly, Gu Mingyuan said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, promise me this. If something is to happen to me, you must protect Lingxi.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, please rest assured. I will protect Lingxi with my life.&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I am very assured. I&rsquo;ve already seen you do it." Gu Mingyuan smiled in a very gratified manner.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Then, Chu Feng and Gu Mingyuan chatted a bit more. However, they did not chat for too long, because it seemed like Gu Mingyuan was really in a rush to leave.<br>When Chu Lingxi, Gu Mingyuan and Chu Xuanzhengfa left, Chu Feng naturally had to see them off.<br>Even though he could not see them all the way to the teleportation formation, he needed to at least see them off with his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Chu Lingxi!!!&rdquo;<br>However, at the moment when Chu Lingxi and the others were about to leave, a voice sounded from within the palace that Chu Feng was training in.<br>That voice belonged to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;I will give you one final chance, are you really going to give up?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you plan to give up, do not think of obtaining this old man&rsquo;s help again for the rest of your life. Likewise, do not think about obtaining Divine Power for the rest of your life.&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s voice sounded again. He knew that Chu Lingxi was planning to leave. Thus, the tone of his voice was slightly angry.<br>Hearing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s voice, Chu Feng felt a slight hint of sadness.<br>Although the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was someone who laughed and joked around a lot, someone who did not resemble a senior at all. Chu Feng knew very well that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had been helping them in the past month and a half.<br>Chu Feng knew that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist thought very highly of Chu Lingxi. The reason why he asked her those questions was because he did not want her to leave.<br>Unfortunately, Chu Lingxi&hellip; was determined to leave.<br>&ldquo;Senior, thank you for looking after me. Also, thank you for bringing my father and Chu Feng out from the Gate of Death. However, in regards to becoming a Divine Body, I am truly incapable of enjoying it. Senior, farewell.&rdquo; Chu Lingxi replied loudly.<br>Hearing those words, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s voice did not sound again.<br>With that, Chu Lingxi, Gu Mingyuan and Chu Xuanzhengfa left.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu, on the other hand, stayed.<br>After seeing Chu Lingxi and the others off. Chu Feng hurriedly returned to the palace where the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was.<br>The most external palace hall inside the palace was the location where Chu Feng trained.<br>As for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, he had been in the inner hall the entire time.<br>Normally, unless the Ox-nosed Old Daoist called for him, Chu Feng would not take the initiative to set foot into the inner hall.<br>However, this time around, Chu Feng directly pushed through the door and entered the inner hall.<br>After pushing open the inner hall&rsquo;s doors, he discovered the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. However, the instant he saw the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, he was immediately stunned.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng had a very pained expression in his eyes.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was currently naked and sitting cross-legged in a tub.<br>That tub was created with a spirit formation. It was a healing formation.<br>Chu Feng was able to hear from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s voice earlier that he was slightly weak.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng was worried about him, and decided to directly enter the inner hall.<br>And now, the situation of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was much more severe than he had imagined.<br>&ldquo;Why did you come in here?&rdquo; The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was slightly displeased to see Chu Feng in the inner hall.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please don&rsquo;t say anything for now.&rdquo; Chu Feng ignored his displeasure and directly arrived before him. He released his spirit power to help the Ox-nosed Old Daoist treat his injuries.<br>Chu Feng was feeling very complicated. A look of guilt and shame filled his face.<br>Although the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had an ugly appearance and was very old, he was someone who spoke with great confidence, great strength and a lot of laughter.<br>However, the current Ox-nosed Old Daoist was extremely weak.<br>Chu Feng knew that the reason why the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was so weak was due to him helping him and Chu Lingxi in the tempering of their bodies.<br>Chu Feng had realized from the very start that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist would wear out his body by helping them increase the speed of their tempering process.<br>However, it was only after seeing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist that Chu Feng discovered that the exhaustion to his body was much more severe than he had imagined.<br>Chu Lingxi had wrongly blamed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had most definitely not deceived them. Otherwise, there would be no reason for him to become like that by helping them.<br>Whilst treating the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Chu Feng was unable to take his gaze off his body.<br>Although the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was extremely weak, the wounds that covered his body were even more shocking to the eyes.<br>Those were old wounds. His wounds covered his entire body. It seemed like the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s body was once shattered to pieces, and then gradually put back together.<br>Those wounds were no ordinary wounds. Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to not heal, for them to remain so clear and vivid.<br>Chu Feng suspected that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist must&rsquo;ve been seriously injured in the past.<br>His injuries must have been extremely destructive. Even though the wounds were old, Chu Feng was able to imagine what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had suffered back then.<br>In fact, Chu Feng even felt that it was a miracle that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was still alive.<br>Perhaps&hellip; that was what it truly meant to survive by the skin of one&rsquo;s teeth.<br></p></div>
