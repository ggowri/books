        <div> - Flowers Of The Three Cities<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Exactly what is going on? Can you explain things more clearly?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, this matter is a little complicated. Hear me out, I&rsquo;ll slowly explain things to you.&rdquo;<br>Kong Tianhui began to inform Chu Feng about everything that happened.<br>That said, it was actually not as complicated as Kong Tianhui said it to be.<br>In Divine Body Royal City, due to the fact that Kong Tianhui&rsquo;s father was simply too licentious, Kong Tianhui ended up having a lot of siblings, mostly older siblings.<br>Furthermore, amongst his siblings, many of them were known to be geniuses.<br>Among them was a man who was Kong Tianhui&rsquo;s half older brother by the same father. This man was named Kong Feiyang.<br>Although Kong Feiyang was no longer a person of the younger generation, he was only fifty years older than Kong Tianhui, and not even two hundred years old.<br>However, he had the same cultivation as Kong Tianhui. He too was a rank one Exalted.<br>That Kong Feiyang and Kong Tianhui had never gotten along with one another since their childhood.<br>Although the two of them were brothers, they could be said to be old enemies.<br>By pure coincidence, when Chu Feng was fighting Linghu Hongfei in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm, both Kong TIanhui and Kong Feiyang were present.<br>At that time, there were actually many elders from Divine Body Royal City present. Furthermore, those elders were all praising Chu Feng.<br>Kong Tianhui wanted to show off. Since he had that compass that was capable of suppressing spirit power, he declared on the spot that he would definitely be able to defeat Chu Feng should he and Chu Feng fight.<br>Originally, Kong Tianhui was merely speaking without thinking, merely trying to show off.<br>However, to his surprise, that Kong Feiyang actually stood forward and began to insult Kong Tianhui, saying that he was overestimating his capabilities.<br>The two of them started quarreling on the spot. As they continued to quarrel, Kong Tianhui, under enormous rage, decided to declare that he would challenge Chu Feng, and even bet his life that he would defeat him. That&hellip; was the reason why he traveled to the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Originally, Kong Tianhui was confident that he would be able to defeat Chu Feng.<br>Merely, he never expected Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation to have increased to rank one Exalted.<br>He knew that it would be very difficult for him to defeat Chu Feng now. Thus, with no alternative, he decided to reveal the truth to him.<br>&ldquo;And here I was thinking that you were truly in some sort of crisis. Turns out, you merely decided to make a gamble with someone,&rdquo; Chu Feng took a glance of contempt at Kong Tianhui. He felt that Kong Tianhui was making an enormous fuss over an extremely minor issue.<br>Earlier, Chu Feng was even wondering what it was that could threaten Kong Tianhui&rsquo;s life. However upon learning the truth, he felt extremely helpless.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, this is not a simple gamble,&rdquo; Kong Tianhui explained with a serious expression.<br>&ldquo;In that case, if you are to win, would that Kong Feiyang kill himself?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;With how shameless he is, he would definitely not kill himself,&rdquo; said Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;There you go,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the same. If I am to defeat you, Kong Tianhui will lose all his face and be completely humiliated.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, this is extremely important. There&rsquo;s a fifty year age difference between him and I. Logically, I am more talented than him. Yet, he has been unwilling to accept that the entire time, and continued to go against me in everything. I have truly been oppressed by him for too long,&rdquo; said Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;In that case, why don&rsquo;t you fight him directly and defeat him? Wouldn&rsquo;t you be able to prove yourself even better that way?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;If I were able to defeat him, I wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered with all this. The crucial aspect is that I was unable to defeat him when I was younger, and ended up being defeated by him every time. In recent years, although my cultivation has caught up to his, I'm still unable to defeat him. At the very most, we would only tie.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The current situation is that he has defeated me before, whereas I have never managed to defeat him,&rdquo; said Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;Your talent surpasses his. As time passes, you will sooner or later be able to defeat him. Why bother seeking victory right now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;While that makes sense and I was indeed acting too impatient, the issue is that we already decided to make a bet with one another. Furthermore, many of my fellow clansmen and elders were present. If I cannot defeat you, I will be the one that&rsquo;ll be completely humiliated,&rdquo; Kong Tianhui&rsquo;s eyes were flickering nonstop. His eyes resembled the eyes of a little girl; they were filled with grievance and very pitiful.<br>However, no matter how Chu Feng looked at those eyes, he felt them to be disgusting.<br>Nevertheless, Chu Feng still agreed to help him. &ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, are you serious?&rdquo; Kong Tianhui simply did not dare to believe his ears.<br>Kong Tianhui knew very well that requesting a top genius to lose publicly lose to him was something very few people were willing to do. After all, that was something that would ruin one&rsquo;s reputation.<br>That was the reason why he decided to coax and pester Chu Feng, why he would get off his high horse to worm his way into being friends with him.<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;But, you&rsquo;ll have to return to Divine Body Royal City with me,&rdquo; said Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not an issue,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;Haha. Brother Chu Feng, you are truly good to me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, you can rest assured too. I will not have you journey with me in vain. Once we&rsquo;re there, I will introduce two great beauties to you,&rdquo; said Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that. You also do not have to prepare any gifts either. Also, don&rsquo;t bother trying some honey trap. I'm merely helping you because I want to help,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No no, that&rsquo;s not it at all. Those two beauties that I mentioned are no ordinary beauties,&rdquo; as he said those words, a very proud expression appeared on Kong Tianhui&rsquo;s face. Not only that, but he even raised his brows twice at Chu Feng. &ldquo;Those two beauties I mentioned are little sister Xian Yun and little sister Long Ning.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh? Who are they?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Wha?&rdquo; Kong Tianhui was stupefied. His mouth hung wide open. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not tell me that you don&rsquo;t know Xian Yun and Long Ning.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. Who are they?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I give up. Brother Chu Feng, you must&rsquo;ve been infatuated with cultivating and turned yourself into a fool, right?&rdquo; Kong Tianhui looked at Chu Feng with concern. However, he then began to explain who Xian Yun and Long Ning were.<br>It turned out that Xian Yun was the strongest person of the younger generation from Monstrous Holy City.<br>As for that Long Ning, she was the strongest person of the younger generation from Ancestral Martial Dragon City.<br>The two of them not only possessed exceptional talent that Kong Tianhui described to be existences comparable to Linghu Hongfei and Chu Feng, but they were also rare beauties.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, let me tell you, it&rsquo;s not that easy to meet the two of them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, they don't allow others to paint their portraits.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, most people have only heard of their beauty, and very few have actually managed to witness it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, in the upcoming days, it just so happens to be the time for the gathering of the Three Cities&rsquo; younger generations. Thus&hellip; you will be able to enjoy a treat for the eyes. At that time&hellip; I will also introduce that disappointing little sister of mine. Although I do not think my little sister is good looking at all, that girl is slightly pretty. An innumerable amount of men have also fallen for her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, I even gave them a title. It&rsquo;s a very graceful title - Flowers of the Three Cities.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo; Chu Feng was originally quite interested as he continued to listen. However, all of a sudden, he burst into laughter.<br>&ldquo;Flowers of the Three Cities? Are you serious with that?&rdquo; he asked.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Was that title so graceful that it shocked you?&rdquo; Kong Tianhui had a proud look on his face. He seemed to not have realized that Chu Feng was ridiculing him.<br>&ldquo;Graceful, graceful,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded repeatedly. However, he was unable to conceal his smile.<br>He had to admit that that fellow Kong Tianhui, after discarding his rude and unreasonable outward appearance to reveal his true character, was quite interesting to be around.<br>In fact, he even gave Chu Feng a feeling of familiarity.<br>If Chu Feng had to describe it, then he could only say that Kong Tianhui resembled Wang Qiang.<br></p></div>
