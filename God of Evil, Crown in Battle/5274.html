        <div>: The Legacy of the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant?<br>While Chu Feng was figuring out the situation, the monk scanned their surroundings and asked, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Long Chengyu? Why isn&rsquo;t he here yet?&rdquo;<br>Just then, the white-haired woman returned.<br>&ldquo;Who are you? Are you from this remnant?&rdquo; the monk asked.<br>Instead of replying, the woman showed the silver token she had received from the white spirit formation gate she had walked out of. She was telling them that she had come here from the Trial of the Strongest too.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Long Chengyu? How surprising. I didn&rsquo;t expect Long Chengyu to be as beautiful as a woman,&rdquo; the monk remarked.<br>The white-haired woman frowned upon hearing those words. She looked at the monk as if he was a fool.<br>Chu Feng was also rendered speechless. With a sigh, he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s Long Chengyu.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t Long Chengyu?&rdquo; the monk asked in surprise.<br>&ldquo;She is a woman no matter how I look at her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Hm? Are you telling me that she is a woman and thus isn&rsquo;t Long Chengyu?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that obvious?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My apologies. I heard that Long Chengyu was participating in the Trial of the Strongest, so I assumed that he would be the champion for the early Half-God level category. Please forgive me for my discourtesy,&rdquo; the monk said with an awkward smile.<br>The white-haired woman coldly glared at the monk. She was clearly bothered by his remark.<br>&ldquo;Miss, I must say that I&rsquo;m surprised that you defeated the greatest prodigy of the Totem Dragon Clan, Long Chengyu. May I know your name?&rdquo; the monk asked.<br>The white-haired woman didn&rsquo;t answer the question. She tossed her token toward Chu Feng and the others before sitting cross-legged on the ground to cultivate.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, that woman seems to be looking down on you,&rdquo; Eggy remarked with a chuckle.<br>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied. He wasn&rsquo;t interested in the woman&rsquo;s opinion of him.<br>However, he did understand what the woman was trying to get at. The latter must have explored the forest and found no clues too, so she figured that combining the key might lie in the tokens they had received.<br>Thus, Chu Feng reached into his Cosmos Sack to retrieve his golden token.<br>&ldquo;What the hell? Golden?! Brother, your token is golden in color!&rdquo; the monk exclaimed. &ldquo;Golden, silver, and bronze&hellip; You must have been the first one to clear that test earlier! Heavens! No wonder they say not to judge a book by its cover. I would have never been able to tell from your appearance that you are such a talented individual!&rdquo;<br>It was apparent from the color of the tokens that they were alluding to some kind of ranking, which led the monk to deduce that it was related to how fast they had cleared the earlier test.<br>Upon hearing the monk&rsquo;s words, the white-haired woman opened her eyes. She was visibly stunned to see that Chu Feng&rsquo;s token was golden in color, but she quickly retracted her gaze afterward.<br>On the other hand, Long Xiaoxiao felt a little awkward as her token wasn&rsquo;t even bronze in color. It looked more like a piece of scrap metal.<br>&ldquo;Miss, there&rsquo;s no need to hide your token. I have already seen it. It&rsquo;s made out of iron, right?&rdquo; the monk said.<br>&ldquo;You sure have good eyes.&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao rolled her eyes before taking out her token too.<br>The four tokens were finally placed together, but it didn&rsquo;t generate any reaction at all. Perplexed, Chu Feng exerted his spirit power to check if there were any secrets hidden in the four tokens.<br>&ldquo;My gosh! You&rsquo;re a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist! To think that your spirit power is even stronger than your martial cultivation! It&rsquo;s no wonder you&rsquo;re the strongest in the late Martial Exalted level category. I can&rsquo;t think of anyone more qualified for that position other than you. It looks like it wasn&rsquo;t without reason that my junior lost in the tournament," the monk shouted.<br>The white-haired woman opened her eyes once more and earnestly assessed Chu Feng, but she soon retracted her gaze and turned her attention back to her cultivation.<br>&ldquo;Can you stop kicking up a huge fuss over everything? It&rsquo;s scaring me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Heh, my apologies. I was born with a loud voice. Please bear with it a little,&rdquo; the monk said.<br>&ldquo;I am Chu Feng. How should I address you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am Wang Luan&rsquo;s senior, Liu Kuo.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wang Luan? Is it the monk who was in the same field as me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s that ugly little baldie who can&rsquo;t even match a tenth of my dashing looks,&rdquo; Liu Kuo replied with a wide grin.<br>&ldquo;Pft! Who gave him the confidence to say those words?&rdquo; Eggy spat.<br>In terms of appearances, Wang Luan was definitely more of a looker than Liu Kuo was. It was not to say that Liu Kuo was ugly, but it would be more accurate to say that he looked masculine rather than dashing.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only saying that because they are on good terms,&rdquo; Chu Feng told Eggy.<br>It was clear that Liu Kuo and Wang Luan were on very close terms, similar to how he was with Wang Qiang. While those two might tease each other a lot, they wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to crack the skull of anyone who dared to harm them.<br>&ldquo;What about the young miss?&rdquo; Liu Kuo looked at Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Long Xiaoxiao pays respect to Master Liu,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao said with a bow.<br>&ldquo;Miss, please just call me Liu Kuo. Otherwise, big brother Liu would do too. Just don&rsquo;t call me master. It gives me goosebumps,&rdquo; Liu Kuo said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you Liu Kuo then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Big brother Liu is perfectly fine with me too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I got that, Liu Kuo.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng continued attempting to fuse the tokens together but to no avail. In the end, he shook his head and said, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t working.&rdquo;<br>So, Chu Feng, Long Xiaoxiao, and Liu Kuo took back their respective tokens. Long Xiaoxiao picked up the silver token and returned it to the white-haired woman.<br>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;<br>The white-haired woman raised her head and even thanked Long Xiaoxiao. It looked like her hostile attitude was mainly reserved for only men.<br>&ldquo;I am Long Xiaoxiao. How should I address you, big sister?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked courteously.<br>The woman didn&rsquo;t reply.<br>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t disturb you from cultivating then,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao said with a smile before walking away.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, what happened? How did you advance to rank five Martial Exalted level?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Long Xiaoxiao via voice transmission.<br>He had already noticed the change in Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s cultivation from the moment she stepped out of the spirit formation gate, and he didn&rsquo;t think that it made sense for her to make so many breakthroughs within such a short span of time.<br>Long Xiaoxiao explained to him via voice transmission that the drastic change in her cultivation was related to the test in the ancient palace. While undergoing the test, she received a powerful surge of energy that allowed her to advance her cultivation to rank five Martial Exalted level.<br>On top of that, she hadn&rsquo;t fully assimilated the surge of energy yet, which meant that she could potentially raise her cultivation even further. It was just that she noticed that she needed time to make the energy hers.<br>She could also choose to continue with the breakthroughs, but it would affect her foundation. Thus, she decided to slowly assimilate the remaining energy until she fully depleted it.<br>&ldquo;Let me take a look.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng grabbed Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s wrist to check if the energy she had absorbed was safe, but he was unable to detect it at all.<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find it.&rdquo; Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to find the energy even with his current observation ability.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dragon silhouette lurking inside my dantian. It&rsquo;s proactively seeking to fuse together with my bloodline.&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng was unable to detect anything, Long Xiaoxiao took the initiative to elaborate on the matter.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, how far do you think you can advance your cultivation if you fully assimilate the energy?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be difficult for me to reach Half-God level,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao replied.<br>&ldquo;What incredible energy. I heard that we&rsquo;re currently in the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant. Is it possible that you have been acknowledged by the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>It was bewildering how Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t receive any benefit despite clearing the test, whereas Long Xiaoxiao received such a huge gift.<br>She received a bulk of energy that advanced her cultivation to rank five Martial Exalted level straight away, and it could sustain her all the way till she reached Half-God level. On top of that, there was a dragon silhouette that was actively seeking to fuse together with her bloodline.<br>Most likely, this was the Saint Dragon Ancient Remnant&rsquo;s legacy.<br></div>
