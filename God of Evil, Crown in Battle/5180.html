        <h1>Chapter 5179</h1>
        <div>: Young Master Wolf&rsquo;s Master<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;A sneak ambush? Despicable! Free me right now and fight me like a man!&rdquo;<br>Young master Wolf felt indignant, being bound before he could even showcase his skills.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still talking big? I haven&rsquo;t settled the scores with you for disrespecting my friend,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>As he spoke, he manifested a spirit formation sword that dashed toward young master Wolf.<br>&ldquo;What are you doing? Stop it right now!&rdquo; young master Wolf shrieked in horror.<br>He was reacting in such an exaggerated manner before Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation sword was directed at young master Wolf&rsquo;s third leg. There was nothing more important to a man than that. Should it be severed, he would have to spend his life as a eunuch.<br>But no matter how young master Wolf shrieked, the spirit formation sword didn&rsquo;t slow in the slightest.<br>Psh!<br>The sudden onslaught of pain made young master Wolf grit his teeth, but his shrieking stopped. In fact, relief could be seen on his frowning face.<br>The spirit formation sword had plunged into his left thigh instead of his third leg.<br>Needless to say, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t have possibly missed the target. It was an intentional move to frighten young master Wolf into submission, just that it proved to be futile. After a moment of fluster, young master Wolf&rsquo;s face warped in fury.<br>&ldquo;Bastard! Are you toying with me now? You can hide all you want, but the friend you spoke of is in the Nameless Sect, right? Even if you&rsquo;re able to get away scot-free, the rest of them won&rsquo;t be that lucky. I&rsquo;ll make them vanish from the face of the world. Your friend will regret ever being acquainted with you!&rdquo; young master Wolf roared murderously.<br>Chu Feng narrowed his eyes as killing intent gushed out from him.<br>&ldquo;Looks like I have no reason to spare you anymore.&rdquo;<br>He gathered his spirit power into a massive hand that sought to crush young master Wolf flat. He had already given young master Wolf a second chance, but the latter had already made it clear that he was determined to exact vengeance.<br>Even if Chu Feng spared young master Wolf today out of the kindness of his heart, the latter would surely go after the Nameless Sect. Since that was the case, he had no choice but to sever the problem at the root.<br>Weng!<br>The massive hand squeezed down on young master Wolf, distorting his body. Just before he was about to be crushed into bits, golden light suddenly rushed out from his body. It quickly expanded outward, pushing away Chu Feng&rsquo;s massive hand.<br>Chu Feng still had young master Wolf under his control, but it was no longer possible for him to kill him anymore. He could tell that the golden light was a barrier harnessing the power of a Half-God level cultivator.<br>If this defensive barrier was fully released, its sheer might would have easily obliterated Chu Feng and everyone else present.<br>Shortly after the formation appeared, a towering silhouette formed out of spirit power emerged from the golden light. It was dressed in a long cloak that completely covered him up, making it impossible to make out his appearance.<br>The first thing the silhouette did was scan the surroundings. It was likely that the protective formation was linked to the person who had constructed it, allowing him to observe the situation here.<br>This also hinted that the person who had constructed the formation wasn&rsquo;t too far away, possibly in the Bittersea Lower Realm too or a neighboring realm. Even the strongest of formations were limited by distance. It would have been hard for him to project his consciousness into the formation if he was too far away.<br>This was not an advanced technique. Most world spiritists could do it as long as they were in the vicinity of their formation. Still, it would be foolish to make light of the person because of this. The protective formation had already shown that he was at least a God-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t be too worried if he still had the Asura World Spirit with him, but the Asura World Spirit Army had been sealed off and Lord Yuwei was severely injured. It would be difficult for him to even deal with ordinary Half-Gods.<br>Naturally, he couldn&rsquo;t make light of the situation.<br>While Chu Feng was assessing the situation, the towering silhouette was also trying to find the person who had harmed young master Wolf. He could easily tell that none of those present had the ability to hurt him.<br>Thus, he asked, &ldquo;Who is the one who tried to kill my disciple? Show yourself!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart shook.<br>He recognized that voice! It belonged to someone whom he knew, or to be exact, a cat.<br>Old Cat!<br>The towering silhouette projected in the formation was nothing like Old Cat&rsquo;s short stature, but Old Cat had always been one to tread carefully. It wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising for it to falsify its own appearance.<br>So, he hurriedly sent a voice transmission to Yue Ling and her master, instructing them not to reveal his name. It was only after receiving their promise that he finally spoke up, &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t qualified to make me show myself. Your disciple harmed my friend but showed no repentance about it, even swearing to kill her once I&rsquo;m gone. He left me with no choice but to take his life.&rdquo;<br>Suspecting the towering silhouette to be Old Cat, Chu Feng had altered his own voice to conceal his identity.<br>&ldquo;It sounds like my disciple is the one in the wrong here, but it&rsquo;s only normal for youngsters to err. Why don&rsquo;t I apologize to you on his behalf and compensate you with some treasures? I hope that you can be gracious enough to spare him with that,&rdquo; the towering silhouette said.<br>&ldquo;As his master, it&rsquo;s your responsibility to keep him in line. Your indulgence is the reason behind his arrogance. If you want me to spare him, you&rsquo;ll have to come here and personally apologize to me. Otherwise&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng manifested countless spirit formation daggers. With a fling of his sleeves, these daggers flew toward the army of the Nine Levels Pavilion.<br>Blood spurted everywhere.<br>Yue Ling shrieked out of shock, and the face of Yue Ling&rsquo;s master turned livid. The Nameless Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster froze in place, momentarily forgetting about the pain he was in. The two arrogant masters even peed their pants.<br>In just a matter of moments, everyone from the Nine Levels Pavilion and the witnessing powers had been killed. With just a single move, he obliterated all of them.<br>&ldquo;Master, save me!&rdquo; young master Wolf cried in fright.<br>He realized that he had provoked the wrong person today. If Chu Feng was able to take millions of lives with a fling of his sleeves, there was no reason he would hesitate to take one more. The only one who could save him now was his master.<br></p></div>
