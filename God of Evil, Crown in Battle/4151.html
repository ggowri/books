        <div> - Change In Attitude<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Why are you still standing there? Quickly, apologize to Grandmaster Liangqiu,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to the four world spiritists.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The four world spiritists&rsquo; faces twitched.<br>Although they were extremely astonished by how Chu Feng was able to breach that protective formation, they found it very difficult and humiliating to actually kowtow and apologize to Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>After all, he was someone that they&rsquo;d looked down on the entire time.<br>Who would be willing to kowtow and apologize to someone that they looked down on?<br>&ldquo;Kneel!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a furious shout was heard. It was Long Daozhi.<br>At the same time as Long Daozhi shouted angrily, he also released his killing intent.<br>This frightened the four world spiritists greatly. They all turned to the four leaders with a cry-for-help look present in their eyes.<br>&ldquo;Grandmasters, one should keep one&rsquo;s promise,&rdquo; said the four leaders.<br>Hearing those words, the four world spiritists found themselves helpless. They had no choice but to accept fate.<br>&ldquo;We were in the wrong earlier. We hope that Grandmaster Liangqiu won&rsquo;t take offense,&rdquo; said the four world spiritists.<br>Although they apologized, they had not knelt, nor had they kowtowed. In fact, there was no sincerity in their voices at all.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you all to kowtow as you apologize!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am not telling you to act indifferent and relaxed as you apologize!&rdquo; shouted Long Daozhi again.<br>His killing intent became even more intense.<br>It was as if Long Daozhi would kill them if they still refused to do as he ordered.<br>Most importantly, the attitudes of those four leaders were the same as before.<br>With the situation like that, even though they were unwilling, the four world spiritists had no choice but to obey.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, we were wrong.&rdquo;<br>Although they had knelt and kowtowed, they only did the motion, and still showed no signs of sincerity.<br>In fact, after kneeling and kowtowing, they immediately stood up and looked at Chu Feng. &ldquo;This is fine now, right?&rdquo;<br>Even the tone of their voices contained annoyance.<br>&ldquo;This is fine?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng chuckled with contempt. Then, he said, &ldquo;The conditions earlier were not limited to just these.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, we&rsquo;ve already apologized! Don&rsquo;t you be too excessive!&rdquo;<br>The four world spiritists were finally at the end of their patience. They actually shouted angrily at Chu Feng.<br>They were willing to tolerate the act of apologizing and kowtowing. But cutting out their own tongues was simply something impossible for them to do.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, what happened earlier was a misunderstanding. We are allies, there&rsquo;s no need for things to become this serious.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Since the protective formation has been breached, we should quickly enter the Endless Abyss. After all, many people have already entered it before us. We need to hurry up and catch up with them.&rdquo;<br>The four powers&rsquo; leaders started speaking out against it.<br>However, there was an enormous change in their attitude compared to before.<br>They were extremely courteous as they spoke to Chu Feng. There was no sign of their earlier arrogance and contempt. In fact, they spoke as if they were pampering Chu Feng, and were deeply afraid that they might end up saying something that could bring displeasure to him.<br>&ldquo;Since I&rsquo;m the one that opened this entrance, I am naturally also able to seal it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whilst you all might not be able to tell, I&rsquo;ve already set up my own sealing formation around this entrance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unless I am to remove it, none of you can enter. The spirit formation I&rsquo;ve set up is even stronger than the original protective formation,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words, the expressions of many of the people present changed greatly.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s action was no different than blackmailing the people present.<br>One of the four world spiritists pointed at Chu Feng and lashed out. &ldquo;Impudent little thief, we are currently fighting for time to enter the Endless Abyss! How could you seal the entrance and block Milords from entering?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should know that Milords sought us to help them, and not cause trouble for them instead!&rdquo;<br>It was the same yellow-haired world spiritist that first had started accusing Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Earlier, he had been extremely afraid of Chu Feng.<br>After all, they had been the ones in the wrong whereas Chu Feng had managed to breach the spirit formation.<br>But, after Chu Feng declared that he had sealed off the entrance with his spirit formation, the yellow-haired world spiritist thought that he had found an opportunity to turn things around.<br>He knew very well what sort of people the leaders of the four powers were.<br>Although they had been banished from the Dragon Clan, they remained very arrogant, and hated being threatened by others.<br>Because of that, he believed that Chu Feng&rsquo;s behavior was akin to committing a massive crime. He wanted to use the opportunity to take care of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, did you really seal the entrance with a spirit formation?&rdquo;<br>The four leaders all looked to Chu Feng. A slight amount of ill-intent could be seen in their eyes.<br>Seeing that, the yellow-haired world spiritist became immensely proud of himself.<br>He felt that his scheme had worked.<br>Sure enough, the four leaders would not allow Chu Feng to threaten them.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chu Feng answered in a manner that was neither servile nor overbearing.<br>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the four leaders looked to one another.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Then, the four of them attacked at the same time.<br>Blood splattered and screams followed suit. The blood and screams had come from the four world spiritists&rsquo; mouths.<br>At that moment, the four world spiritists had all fallen to the ground and were wailing miserably as blood continued to flow from their mouths.<br>The four leaders had attacked them.<br>&ldquo;Bunch of trash.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We asked for you all to come here to breach the spirit formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, not only did you fail to breach the spirit formation, but you instead wrongly accused others. Your moral qualities are truly lacking.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;People like the four of you shall be taught a lesson.&rdquo;<br>After attacking them the four leaders began to fiercely lash out at the four world spiritists.<br>Even though the four of them had been speaking up for their world spiritists earlier, when the question became their world spiritists or their own interests, they did not hesitate to choose their own interests.<br>After lashing out at them, the four leaders turned to Chu Feng. &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, they&rsquo;ve received their punishment. Are you able to remove the spirit formation so that we can enter the Endless Abyss now?&rdquo;<br>They removed their stern and fierce looks once they turned to speak to Chu Feng again. Not only were they smiling, but their voices had also become extremely gentle.<br>Seeing that, Grandmaster Liangqiu and the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City all sighed with deep emotions.<br>Only a while before they had been very arrogant and aloof. They had not placed Chu Feng in their eyes at all. Yet now, a massive transformation in their attitudes had occurred. They acted extremely respectful, and were even filled with humility towards Chu Feng, fearing that they would offend him.<br>This was the power of one&rsquo;s ability.<br>Chu Feng, through his ability, had changed the attitude that those people had toward him.<br>Faced with the respectful attitudes of the four leaders, Chu Feng suddenly revealed a mischievous and joking smile.<br>&ldquo;Four seniors, you all are simply too cruel.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I was merely trying to scare them. How could the four of you really cut out their tongues?&rdquo;<br>The expressions of the four leaders grew slightly ugly as Chu Feng said those words.<br>But, Chu Feng actually continued on, &ldquo;Well then, let&rsquo;s enter. I never set up a spirit formation blocking the entrance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I came here to help. How could I possibly inconvenience everyone instead?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I Chu Feng, wouldn&rsquo;t possibly do something like setting up a spirit formation to seal off the entrance.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the four leaders turned green in the face.<br>Wouldn&rsquo;t this mean that they had been toyed with by him?<br>They had been truly angered. They were so furious that they felt like their internal organs were about to explode with rage. In fact, they even started harboring killing intent towards Chu Feng.<br>In all the years that they&rsquo;d lived, very few people had dared to play them like Chu Feng had.<br>What made it worse was that Chu Feng was from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>However, even though they were raging with anger and on the verge of exploding, they still put forth a smiling face.<br>As matters stood they were all able to tell that even though the young man before them had come from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, he actually possessed true abilities.<br>If they wanted to obtain the Dragon Vein Source Stones and return to the Dragon Clan, they would have to depend on him Thus, although they were displeased, they didn&rsquo;t dare express their displeasure.<br></p></div>
