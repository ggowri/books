        <h1>Chapter 4969</h1>
        <div>: It&rsquo;s Yaoyao<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the girl intimately calling him &lsquo;daddy&rsquo;, a person floated into Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind.<br>Yaoyao, that was the name of the female infant whom Chu Feng brought out of the Asura Graveyard.<br>However, it hadn&rsquo;t even been a year since Yaoyao&rsquo;s birth, but the girl in front of him was already the size of a three years old child. It wasn&rsquo;t just her appearance; Chu Feng had taken a close look at her skeletal structure, and it was that of a three years old child.<br>The age didn&rsquo;t tally here.<br>&ldquo;Daddy, daddy!&rdquo;<br>While Chu Feng was deep in thought, the girl had already arrived before him. She leaped forth and dived straight into Chu Feng&rsquo;s embrace. She wrapped her little arms around Chu Feng&rsquo;s neck and started snuggling up to him.<br>What she said afterward affirmed Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess.<br>&ldquo;Daddy is finally here for Yaoyao!&rdquo;<br>Despite the little girl&rsquo;s astounding strength that allowed her to smash even an Ancient Era being into minced meat with a single strike, her childlike voice was still adorable.<br>Her words proved that she was indeed Yaoyao, the female infant from the Asura Graveyard. But how did she grow so old?<br>It hadn&rsquo;t been that long since they had parted ways.<br>&ldquo;Yaoyao, how did you grow so big?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Ah? How big should Yaoyao be?&rdquo;<br>Yaoyao stared at Chu Feng with her large eyes, clearly confused by his question. Her response amused Chu Feng, and he let out a chuckle.<br>She&rsquo;s still a child. What answer am I expecting from her?<br>In truth, Chu Feng already had some conjectures in mind.<br>In the first place, Yaoyao was no ordinary child. She was from the Asura Graveyard, so it was only normal for her to be different from others. It shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise if her growth differed from others.<br>&ldquo;Yoayao, what are you doing here? Did grandma bring you here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He assumed that the Lady of Dao Sea had brought her here since the latter was taking care of her. On top of that, he couldn&rsquo;t think of anyone who had the ability to uncover this place other than the Lady of Dao Sea.<br>&ldquo;Yup! It&rsquo;s grandma who brought me here. Grandma told me to find things to eat here!&rdquo; Yaoyao replied.<br>&ldquo;Find things to eat? Are you referring to the beast you just defeated?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Yup yup! Daddy is really smart! Heehee&hellip;&rdquo; Yaoyao replied with a grin.<br>Most people would have been shocked to hear those words from a little girl, but Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think much of it. He remembered that Yaoyao fed on origin energies to grow, so she was probably killing those beasts to assimilate their origin energies.<br>He was just surprised that the Lady of Dao Sea would bring her to such a dangerous place and allow her to hunt on her own.<br>&ldquo;Yaoyao, is there anyone else here other than grandma?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>While he was happy to have met Yaoyao, he was more worried about the situation with the ancient remnant here.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s also big sister Lele, big sister Feifei, big sister&hellip; A lot of the big sisters from the Dao Sea are here! There are also some strangers whom Yaoyao doesn&rsquo;t like too,&rdquo; Yaoyao said with a pout.<br>&ldquo;Strangers?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured contemplatively.<br>Then, he asked, &ldquo;Yaoyao, do you know where grandma is? Can you lead me to them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yup! But grandma told Yaoyao to stay here. She said that she&rsquo;ll fetch Yaoyao later on,&rdquo; Yaoyao replied obediently.<br>It looked like she was very heeding of the Lady of Dao Sea&rsquo;s words. However, she soon added with a mischievous grin, &ldquo;But Yaoyao will listen to daddy more than grandma!&rdquo;<br>Her smile was extremely sweet, and it brought a smile onto Chu Feng&rsquo;s face too.<br>Even though Yaoyao wasn&rsquo;t his real child, he still felt like a father to her.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s like to be a father. It&rsquo;s no wonder why most parents are willing to give everything to their own children.&rdquo;<br>It would be a stretch to say that Chu Feng was close to Yaoyao&mdash;they had barely spent any time together&mdash;but somehow, he felt a strong urge to protect this child, even at the expense of his own life.<br>&ldquo;Yaoyao, let&rsquo;s go look for grandma and big sister Lele,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;<br>Yaoyao happily grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm and began leading the way for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, is she really your daughter? Who is her grandma?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian asked.<br>They didn&rsquo;t show themselves, choosing instead to communicate with him via voice transmission.<br>Chu Feng honestly told them about Yaoyao&rsquo;s origin and the Lady of Dao Sea.<br>&ldquo;Lady of Dao Sea? How did she find this place? Furthermore, based on what the little girl has said, it seems like others have also found this place too? This is weird. Our Holy Valley has set up barriers along the way, and none of them have been breached. Unless&hellip; there are other paths leading here,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei murmured doubtfully.<br>Chu Feng had the same doubts too.<br>After some discussion, Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian decided to remain hidden and follow Chu Feng for the time being. It was not to guard against the Lady of Dao Sea but the others.<br>If the Lady of Dao Sea was the only one here, they could still talk things over.<br>However, if there were outsiders around who coveted the ancient remnant, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t willing to yield this opportunity to them.<br>On top of that, Shengguang Baimei mentioned that the Holy Valley didn&rsquo;t dispatch anyone to guard this place because the previous Holy Monarch had set up some formations around the area, making it hard for outsiders to find this place and get to the ancient remnant.<br>Shengguang Baimei had just checked on the formation, and it was still intact. This meant that no one had accessed the ancient remnant yet.<br>If so, there were two possibilities.<br>One, the people who found this place were unable to breach the formation.<br>Two, the people who found this place only knew about the underground world but hadn&rsquo;t discovered the ancient remnant yet.<br>Chu Feng was still feeling hopeful about the situation.<br></p></div>
