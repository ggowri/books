        <h1>Chapter 3149</h1>
        <div> - The Grudges Between The Two Clans<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This matter was caused by Chu Hongyi.<br>To out it simply, during a time when the Chu Heavenly Clan followed the Dongguo Heavenly Clan to train, the Chu Heavenly Clan, under the leadership of Chu Hongyi, took a cultivation resource that they shouldn&rsquo;t have.<br>That matter ended up angering the Dongguo Heavenly Clan. They demanded that Chu Hongyi admit his mistake and apologize.<br>However, Chu Hongyi not only refused to admit it, but he even insisted that he was not wrong, and instead said that the Dongguo Heavenly Clan was wrongly accusing them.<br>Chu Hongyi's shameless behavior completely enraged the Dongguo Heavenly Clan.<br>The Dongguo Heavenly Clan indicated that unless Chu Hongyi knelt before them and admitted his mistake, they would no longer take care of the Chu Heavenly Clan in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>That was how the Chu Heavenly Clan ended up being abandoned by the Dongguo Heavenly Clan, and were gradually reduced to their current state.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that Chu Hongyi again. He is truly a scourge.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. How could he be so unreasonable?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Haoyan was unable to contain himself from cursing out loud.<br>&ldquo;Actually, the brothers and sisters that have come afterwards all do not know about this.. The reason for that is because Hongyi forbade us to speak of it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the brothers and sisters that are already in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm all know about this matter deep in their hearts. After all, without the protection of the Dongguo Heavenly Clan, our Chu Heavenly Clan would have truly ended up suffering miserably in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, due to Chu Hongyi&rsquo;s cultivation, whilst people are angry, they don&rsquo;t dare to voice their anger, and can only swallow it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I now think that we need to take the initiative to request reconciliation with the Dongguo Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Only with their help will we be able to avoid the coming calamity,&rdquo; Chu Ping said.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Ping, you want me to go and raise the issue of reconciliation, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The one to start the trouble should be the one to end it. Back then, the Dongguo Heavenly Clan did not make things difficult for Chu Hongyi. In fact, they did not even attack him. They only wanted him to admit to his mistake himself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, judging from the tone of the Dongguo Heavenly Clan back then, they seemed to be willing to continue to look after our Chu Heavenly Clan should Chu Hongyi be willing to admit to his mistake,&rdquo; Chu Ping said.<br>&ldquo;They merely demanded an apology, and nothing else?&rdquo; Chu Huanyu asked.<br>&ldquo;They merely sought for an apology from our own accord. Of course&hellip; if Chu Hongyi himself is unwilling to apologize, our clan could force him to apologize for his mistake. However, it must be done by our Chu Heavenly Clan. The Dongguo Heavenly Clan will definitely not forcibly make Chu Hongyi apologize,&rdquo; Chu Ping explained.<br>&ldquo;Merely an apology, yet that Chu Hongyi is actually unwilling to do so. He is truly an unyielding fellow,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan sighed.<br>&ldquo;Unyielding? He&rsquo;s unyielding only against our allies. When faced with hostile powers, he would most likely be terrified and completely witless,&rdquo; Chu Huanyu spoke with contempt.<br>Chu Ping smiled wryly at Chu Huanyu&rsquo;s words.<br>His helpless expression verified what Chu Huanyu said to be true.<br>It could be seen that Chu Hongyi was an individual who would take advantage of the weak, but fear the strong. He would not appreciate another&rsquo;s kindness toward him, but would instead accept another&rsquo;s maltreatment.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Ping, since you know of Chu Hongyi&rsquo;s character, you should not be shielding him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If someone like him is able to change for the better, it would be for the best. However, if he is unable to change for the better, even if he is to leave this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm and return to our Chu Heavenly Clan in the future, he will only be a malignant tumor to our clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we do not remove this tumor, he might end up bringing a disaster upon our Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Chu Ping sighed and said, &ldquo;In the past, whilst we were angry, we did not dare to voice our anger because we were no match for Chu Hongyi, and would have to rely on him to find cultivation resources.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, little brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re here now. You are able to replace Chu Hongyi and lead our Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Ping, you mean to say that you want me to force Chu Hongyi to apologize to the Dongguo Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, that is the only feasible option at hand,&rdquo; Chu Ping said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, big brother Chu Ping, I wish to ask you this: although Chu Hongyi was the one to make the decision back then, did you all follow him and enjoy the cultivation resources with him?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The great majority of our clansmen followed him and enjoyed quite a benefit back then. However, I felt that the cultivation resource did not belong to us, and thus I did not partake of it,&rdquo; Chu Ping said.<br>&ldquo;In other words, it&rsquo;s not only Chu Hongyi who is at fault. Instead, there are many other individuals too. Have those clansmen of ours ever gone to apologize to the Dongguo Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;No. Due to Chu Hongyi&rsquo;s deterrence, everyone decided to stubbornly cling to the view that we weren&rsquo;t at fault. No one attempted to apologize,&rdquo; Chu Ping said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, big brother Chu Ping, the one at fault back then was not only Chu Hongyi alone. Thus, did you really think that this matter would be settled should Chu Hongyi alone apologize?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, in that case, what should we do?&rdquo; Chu Ping asked.<br>&ldquo;The Dongguo Heavenly Clan would not have made their decision back then if they were angry at Chu Hongyi alone. They were disappointed with our Chu Heavenly Clan as a whole.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Leave this matter to me. Tell me where the Dongguo Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory is located. I will go and seek them out,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Chu Ping did not hesitate, and immediately told Chu Feng where the Dongguo Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory was.<br>However, due to where it was, Chu Feng would have to return to their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory in order to reach the Dongguo Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory.<br>After deciding upon what to do, Chu Feng began to return the same way they came from.<br>As the undercurrent of the Immortal River had disappeared, the power restricting their way back had disappeared as well. Thus, it was a smooth journey.<br>Chu Feng and the others first returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory. Upon returning, they discovered that there were only a few people left in the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory. Chu Hongyi and the others were nowhere to be seen.<br></p></div>
