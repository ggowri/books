        <h1>Chapter 3330</h1>
        <div> - Hundred Year Promise<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior Qing Xuantian?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze changed, and his expression turned very serious upon hearing the name of the person mentioned by the Moon Immortal.<br>&ldquo;Mn, it&rsquo;s precisely that person that you&rsquo;re thinking of,&rdquo; the Moon Immortal verified.<br>At that moment, an enormous wave shook Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart. The name Qing Xuantian simply meant too much to him.<br>He was the master of the Four Symbols Divine Beasts.<br>He was the legend of the Nine Provinces Continent.<br>He was the strongest of the Holy Land of Martialism&rsquo;s Five Emperors.<br>When Chu Feng was in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, he had heard legends of Qing Xuantian wherever he went, and had matured under his halo.<br>In fact, there was a time that Chu Feng considered Qing Xuantian to be an existence that he could not surpass.<br>However, later on, things were no longer as simple as he had imagined them to be. With that, his impression of Qing Xuantian had been completely slipped upside down.<br>Furthermore, Qing Xuantian had long since left the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. In addition to that, Qing Xuantian, whose fame was renowned in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, was completely unknown in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>In fact, Chu Feng&rsquo;s father had also mentioned that Qing Xuantian&rsquo;s talent was actually not that strong, and that it was normal for him to not be able to raise waves in the Outer World.<br>However, Chu Feng felt that he shouldn&rsquo;t be completely unknown.<br>Thus, there could only be one possibility. That is, Qing Xuantian had simply never arrived in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Perhaps he had directly proceeded to another starfield.<br>That said, as it had been that many years since Qing Xuantian&rsquo;s era, and martial cultivators were people with finite lifespans, it was hard to determine whether he was even still alive.<br>While it might be easy to seek out other people, it would be extremely difficult to find Qing Xuantian.<br>&ldquo;Senior, do you really think that senior Qing Xuantian is still alive?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I am also uncertain about that. However, I must find him, for there are certain things that I must have a proper face-to-face talk with him about.&rdquo;<br>The Moon Immortal actually became emotional as she said those words. It would appear that the relationship between her and Qing Xuantian was not as simple as the rumors said it was.<br>After hearing those words, Chu Feng frowned slightly. The more extraordinary their relationship was, the more uneasy Chu Feng felt.<br>If Qing Xuantian was truly no longer alive, if he had died many years ago, even if someone knew of him, they would&rsquo;ve already forgotten about him. Besides, with how vast the starfields were, it was simply impossible to know where he was in the first place. As such, where exactly were they to go to find Qing Xuantian?<br>Most importantly, how long must they continue to search for Qing Xuantian?<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I know what you&rsquo;re worried about. How about this&hellip; counting from the time when I occupied Lil&rsquo; Rou and Lil&rsquo; Mei&rsquo;s bodies in the Holy Land of Maritalism, give me a hundred years. If I still cannot find Qing Xuantian in a hundred years&rsquo; time, I will stop searching for him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, not only will I return Su Rou and Su Mei&rsquo;s bodies to them, but I will also impart my cultivation to the two of them completely,&rdquo; the Moon Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this&hellip;&rdquo; At that moment, Chu Feng started feeling a sense of discomfort.<br>To martial cultivators, a hundred years was actually nothing at all. The Moon Immortal&rsquo;s request was not excessive at all.<br>Besides, the Moon Immortal would be imparting her cultivation to Su Rou and Su Mei at that time. To Su Rou and Su Mei, that would be extremely good.<br>Thus, why would Chu Feng be feeling uncomfortable upon hearing it?<br>Firstly, Chu Feng could tell from the attitude of the Moon Immortal that she was most likely very serious when she said those words. After all, there was no reason for her to deceive him. If she didn&rsquo;t want to return Su Rou and Su Mei&rsquo;s bodies, she could very well forcibly occupy them. There was no need for her to make things so complicated for herself.<br>It was precisely because Chu Feng knew that the Moon Immortal was serious that he felt a sense of sadness in his heart. He had a faint feeling that&hellip; should that day arrive, what the Moon Immortal would lose might not only be her cultivation.<br>&ldquo;Senior, although I do not know what there is between senior Qing Xuantian and you, if you are able to find him, I hope that senior would be able to inform me where senior Qing Xuantian is. The reason for that is because there are also some things that I wish to ask senior Qing Xuantian face-to-face.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng did not continue to ask about the matter between the Moon Immortal and Qing Xuantian. The reason for that was because it was likely something personal to the Moon Immortal. Thus, there was no reason for him to probe into that sort of thing, and it was also unsuitable for him to do so.<br>However, Chu Feng must ask Qing Xuantian about the matter regarding the Four Symbols Divine Beasts. Was the truth of what had happened back then truly as the Magma Emperor had said?<br>&ldquo;Very well, I will inform you,&rdquo; the Moon Immortal accepted Chu Feng&rsquo;s request without the slightest hesitation.<br>&ldquo;That said, senior, I cannot decide for Lil&rsquo; Rou and Lil&rsquo; Mei regarding that hundred-year promise that you&rsquo;ve proposed. Thus, you should consult with them about it,&rdquo; Chu Feng added.<br>&ldquo;They have already agreed to it,&rdquo; the Moon Immortal said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled lightly. Even without the Moon Immortal saying that, Chu Feng knew that Su Rou and Su Mei would agree to it. After all, those two girls were the ones that were trying their hardest to dissuade Chu Feng earlier.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you should continue to chat with them for a bit longer. I will be leaving this Ancestral Martial Starfield. Furthermore, I will be doing so tonight,&rdquo; the Moon Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;So soon?&rdquo; Chu Feng was surprised to hear that. Evidently, he was not prepared to bid farewell to Su Rou and Su Mei. Thus, he asked, &ldquo;Senior, where are you going?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am uncertain as to my destination. I am actually&hellip; relying on my intuition to find him. As for my intuition, it has been changing the entire time,&rdquo; the Moon Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;Intuition?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart tensed. It was truly too unreliable to rely on one&rsquo;s intuition to find someone.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you can rest assured. I will protect Su Rou and Su Mei and guarantee their safety. At the very most, in a hundred years&rsquo; time, I will safely return them to your side,&rdquo; the Moon Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;This junior believes in senior. Merely&hellip;&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;Forget about it.&rdquo;<br>In the end, Chu Feng sighed a helpless sigh. As matters stood, even if he refused to compromise, what could he possibly do?<br></p></div>
