        <h1>Chapter 5631: Fairness</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Elder </span><span>Zhenfu&rsquo;s</span><span> words, the managerial elder suddenly felt weak in the knees. He nearly lost his balance and fell to the ground, but he held on with gritted teeth and said, &ldquo;Milord, the chain of events is as I have previously mentioned. I&rsquo;m unsure of Chu Feng&rsquo;s background, but he has indeed&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pah!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tight slap was inflicted on the managerial elder&rsquo;s face, causing his face to distort. Three teeth flew out of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> flicked his wrist and shoved a token into the managerial elder&rsquo;s face, saying, &ldquo;Take a good look at what this is!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn&rsquo;t the Saint-tier Elder&rsquo;s token but a token reserved for the entrance examination. Inscribed on the back of the token was the word &lsquo;Fairness&rsquo;, and the front &lsquo;Enforcer&rsquo;.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the five persons in charge of the entrance examination were issued the enforcer token. This token granted the individual the power to freely deal with anyone whose rank was beneath that of a Saint-tier elder on the spot, including immediate execution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask one last time. Tell me what happened earlier,&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Milord, I deserve to die a thousand times over!&rdquo; Not daring to lie anymore, the managerial elder kneeled on the floor and furious banged his head on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, you do deserve to die a thousand times over. Since you have already admitted to that, I shan&rsquo;t waste my breath with words and send you on your way,&rdquo; Lord </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The managerial elder was stunned. He hurriedly looked at Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> and attempted to plead for mercy, thinking that his crimes didn&rsquo;t deserve death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Elder, I&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he was beheaded before he could finish his words. It was so fast that no one saw what happened, but the crowd knew that it was Lord </span><span>Zhenfu&rsquo;s</span><span> doing. They could sense an immense power coming from Lord </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span>, and it was the power that took the managerial elder&rsquo;s life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was shocking. The managerial elder was a pinnacle God-cloak World Spiritist, an </span><span>expert who was just a step away from becoming a True Dragon World Spiritist. Yet, Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> killed him just like that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> didn&rsquo;t seem too concerned about the kill he had just made. He held the managerial elder&rsquo;s head in his hand as he looked at the other elders present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This is a trial to bring in talents for our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. It&rsquo;s your duty as elders to uphold fairness in the trial. If anyone dares to do anything like that again, I&rsquo;ll kill not just the culprit but his descendants too,&rdquo; Lord </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> sent out a resounding warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone, be it the elders, Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>, or Song Yuping, fearfully kneeled on the floor and lowered their heads, not daring to look Lord </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> in the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> walked over to Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> and Song Yuping and stopped right in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Elder, this matter has nothing to do with it. It&rsquo;s the managerial elder&rsquo;s own doing!&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> hurriedly explained. He thought that he could just push all the blame to the managerial elder now that the latter was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I must look dumb to you.&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> sent Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> flying with a kick. He pointed to himself and growled, &ldquo;Open your dog eyes and look at me. Do I look blind or deaf? I heard what you told Chu Feng loud and clear! Are you taking me for a fool right now?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Elder, I was wrong! I was ignorant! I know my mistakes now. Please, give me a chance!&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> cried out in a fluster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dearly regretted speaking his words out loud earlier. His arrogance had backfired on him, becoming proof of his cheating. He couldn&rsquo;t even deny it now even if he wanted to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he recalled how someone in the managerial elder&rsquo;s position was killed without a second thought, his body began trembling in fear. Before he knew it, he had already burst into tears. Song Yuping was crying even more pitifully beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrogance they had displayed before was nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Crying? Pathetic. You said you are going to put others in their place? How did a coward like you find the courage to spout such arrogant words? Do you even know your own place at all? Useless!&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> sneered at Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> was unable to do anything but cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> formed a series of hand seals before releasing a powerful surge of spirit power into the ground. The scrolls that were distributed earlier to those who had cleared the trial began to glow brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Song Yuping and Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao&rsquo;s</span><span> scrolls vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> turned to Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> and said, &ldquo;You have a good father, but you think too highly of yourself if you think that you can have your way in our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion too. Let&rsquo;s see how many times he can protect you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> turned to the elders behind him and declared, &ldquo;Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> and Song Yuping are disqualified from the entrance examination.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; the elders replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span>, is there anything you&rsquo;d like to add on?&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You have already said everything that has to be said. What else can I add on?&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Eyy</span><span>, you should at least say something. Lord Mansion Master tasked us to carry out this mission together. Others might think that you&rsquo;re slacking off on your duty if you don't at least say a word or two,&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> replied with a chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> and Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> had received a scroll each, the contents of their scrolls were the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> turned to the elders and said, &ldquo;Some words of reminder. Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> and I have come here to check on Chu Feng, but there&rsquo;s nothing more than that. You aren&rsquo;t to accord him special treatment because of this. Remember what Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> has said&mdash;fairness is key.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; the elders replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> nodded in satisfaction. With a wave of his hand, he disintegrated the elders pinning Chu Feng down. Then, he constructed a recovery formation that instantaneously healed Chu Feng&rsquo;s injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once that was done, he looked at Chu Feng with a smile and said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, we&rsquo;re looking forward to your performance.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words left the crowd in a dilemma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, should we be impartial or accord him special treatment? I mean, look at how fawning Elder </span><span>Qinghe&rsquo;s</span><span> smile is! That&rsquo;s a Saint-tier elder right there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The entrance examination will commence this afternoon. I wish all of you the best of luck,&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> said before enveloping the crowd with a surge of teleportation energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Chu Feng knew it, he had already been transported to a vast field. Many silhouettes appeared one after another in the vicinity, crowding out the area. These people were all junior world spiritists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some had a sickle in hand, but there were also those with a spear, a sword, or a dagger. Only a small proportion of them had a scroll in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those in possession of a scroll excitedly awaited the entrance examination, whereas those without a scroll lamented their disqualification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng unfurled his scroll and saw that the ranking had been changed. He was in first place, followed by Chen Hui and Tang Wan&hellip; Other than that, he noticed that his scroll contained a storage formation, and he could sense an exceptionally potent World Spiritist Pearl inside it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Heaven-tier World Spiritist Pearl.</span></p></div>
