        <h1>Chapter 1125</h1>
        <div> - Wooing Bai Ruochen?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Bai Ruochen&rsquo;s sense of observation was very powerful. Due to the fact that she was doubtful to begin with, she had been observing the change in Yuan Qing&rsquo;s expression the entire time.<br>Under her strict observation, even though Yuan Qing pretended very well, a mistake was still discovered by Bai Ruochen - Yuan Qing&rsquo;s reaction was abnormal, as if he was trying to hide the truth.<br>&ldquo;Lil Sis Ruochen, congratulations on obtaining the General Flag.&rdquo; However, right at this moment, a voice suddenly sounded into Bai Ruochen&rsquo;s ears. Hearing this voice, Bai Ruochen displayed a pleasantly surprised expression. That was because it was Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice.<br>Turning toward the direction of the voice, as expected, Bai Ruochen discovered Chu Feng outside of the vast crowd.<br>With a movement of her delicate body, Bai Ruochen flew like a fairy and arrived beside Chu Feng. Her beautiful eyes turned toward him and, with a puzzled expression and a questioning tone, she asked. &ldquo;What exactly is going on here. This is something that you did, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heh, sure enough, I can&rsquo;t hide anything from you. Follow me, I&rsquo;ll show you something.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled helplessly. After that, he displayed a movement martial skill and flew around the enormous rock toward the faraway distant place. Seeing this, Bai Ruochen also hurriedly followed Chu Feng.<br>Due to the fact that the gazes of the crowd were all focused upon Yuan Qing, no one took note of the actions of those two.<br>Chu Feng and Bai Ruochen flew far away from the crowd and arrived at a remote location. First, Chu Feng created a concealing spirit formation and then turned his hand to his Cosmos Sack.<br>&ldquo;Buzz.&rdquo; As the light flickered on his Cosmos Sack, a large banner that shone with golden light and had the word &lsquo;Commander&rsquo; written on it appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>That banner appeared to be extremely domineering. It was several times taller than Chu Feng himself. However, being held by Chu Feng, it was simply a perfect match; it was as if this banner was created solely for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This is&hellip; the Commander Flag?!&rdquo; Even though she already guessed that this matter might be related to Chu Feng, Bai Ruochen was still unable to contain her astonishment after seeing the Commander Flag in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand. Her beautiful eyes shone like the starry sky.<br>The Commander Flag was the ultimate goal of participating in the Commander Contest. Even though she already anticipated that Chu Feng might be able to obtain the Commander Flag, she was still, nevertheless, shocked when Chu Feng actually obtained it.<br>&ldquo;What exactly is going on here? Did you deliberately give the honor of obtaining the Commander Flag to Yuan Qing?&rdquo;<br>After being shocked, Bai Ruochen asked with sharpness, &ldquo;If my guess is correct, you did not only casually teach Yuan Qing a lesson. The sack that you were carrying before, it was Yuan Qing inside it, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re truly intelligent. All your guesses are correct.&rdquo; Chu Feng shrugged his shoulders and nodded.<br>&ldquo;In that case, why did you do all this? What are your intentions? For this many people to be striving for this glory, it naturally meant that there was a considerable amount of benefit to it. How could you just casually give this glory to someone else? Furthermore, you&rsquo;ve given it to someone that you do not like.&rdquo; Confusion was written all over Bai Ruochen&rsquo;s face. She was even complaining a bit. As she had a very bad impression of that Yuan Qing, she did not wish for Yuan Qing to obtain the glory.<br>&ldquo;I am the one holding the Commander Flag. All of the benefits that comes with it are within my grasp. How could you say that I gave it all to someone else?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, since you&rsquo;ve asked, I can tell you why, since I trust you.&rdquo; Chu Feng looked at Bai Ruochen and said with a beaming smile. &ldquo;Actually, there are grievances between Yuan Qing and I since a long time ago. Regardless of whether it was him or me, both of us wanted to settle the grievances in the Cyanwood Mountain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My conduct today is merely to add some interest when settling the debt with him later.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Interest?&rdquo; Bai Ruochen&rsquo;s eyes flickered, evidently, she was still confused and did not understand Chu Feng&rsquo;s purpose.<br>&ldquo;I wish to kill him. Actually, it&rsquo;s very simple, I don&rsquo;t want him to die in a painless manner. To speak in simpler terms, I plan to completely ruin his reputation and make him experience disdain from the entire world, making it that even those who are closest to him will become thorns in his side. All of this is to make him experience true pain.&rdquo; Chu Feng casually said those words. However, a flash of fierceness shone through his eyes.<br>Hearing till this point, Bai Ruochen finally understood Chu Feng&rsquo;s intentions. However, a complicated expression appeared on her ice-cold face. She asked, &ldquo;Exactly how enormous of a grievance is there between you two, for you to use this sort of scheme to push him down to the bottomless abyss?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lil Sis Ruochen, you&rsquo;re thinking too much about it. Just because I am using schemes does not mean that there is an enormous grievance between he and I. Merely, I will never let those who declare themselves my enemy live well. This is merely the way I handle things; it is not related to how deep the hatred and grievance I have with any individual.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s go. We have already obtained what we came here for. There is no need for us to linger here anymore. Let&rsquo;s return and bid our farewells to our seniors.&rdquo; As Chu Feng said those words, he retrieved the Commander Flag and removed the concealing spirit formation. Then, he began to fly toward the direction that they had come from; he was planning to leave the forest of stone.<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s rear view, that was gradually growing further in distance, Bai Ruochen started to frown. She had a grave expression on her face, and her beautiful eyes were flickering indefinitely. Only after some time did she softly sigh and say. &ldquo;Fortunately, I have made this guy into a friend. Otherwise&hellip;&rdquo;<br>After she said those words, the complicated expression she had on her face was easily explained. It turned out that it was actually restraining fear for Chu Feng, a fear that came from the bottom of her heart.<br>However, the fear did not condense itself within her, because she felt that Chu Feng was a person who was clear-cut in his distinguishment of friend and foe. If it was to be said that she was rejoicing that she was not Chu Feng&rsquo;s enemy, then she rejoiced even more that she was Chu Feng&rsquo;s friend.<br>In short, regardless, she now had a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng. This youngster that was only a couple of years older than her had caused her, a very conceited individual, to feel inferior.<br>It could be said that Chu Feng was the most outstanding person among all the people in her generation that she had met so far.<br>After this, Bai Ruochen caught up to Chu Feng and the two of them left the stone forest together.<br>At the moment when the two of them left the stone forest, they were immediately met with applause and cheers. The cheering did not only come from the Ascension Sect, it also came from the other sects. Even the elders from the Cyanwood Mountain were applauding with their hands.<br>This was a sort of acknowledgement. As the first person to obtain a General Flag, Bai Ruochen, the genius who was previously unknown by others, had now obtained the acknowledgement of the crowd.<br>There were many people who felt that Bai Ruochen was able to compete with Wang Yan, Jiang Hao, Huang Juan and even Yuan Qing. With the existence of a genius like her, the Ascension Sect would not be the weakest among the five first-rate subsidiary powers.<br>At this moment, Bai Ruochen was surrounded by the elders and disciples of the Ascension Sect as if she were a revered leader.<br>As for Chu Feng, he was completely ignored by the crowd. Not only did he appear to be isolated, he also appeared to be a bit pitiful-looking. Only Sikong Zhaixing came to welcome his return.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re soon to enter the Cyanwood Mountain. I have already notified the elders that our Southern Cyanwood Forest has here in the Cyanwood Mountain; they will give their all to protect you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I must say still say these words. For some things, if you can restrain yourself, it is better to restrain yourself. Do not try to show off too excessively. After all, the people that you are truly able to rely on in the Cyanwood Mountain are not the elders of our Southern Cyanwood Forest, but instead the elders from the Ascension Sect. However, even with the Ascension Sect&rsquo;s strength, it is not certain that they can protect your safety. Furthermore, I cannot guarantee that they will give their all to protect you either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, you must definitely get along with Bai Ruochen. That girl is very remarkable. Not only is she the beloved daughter of the Ascension Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, she is also the hope of the Ascension Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you maintain a harmonious relationship with her, the Ascension Sect will definitely give their all to protect you. This would also strengthen our Southern Cyanwood Forest&rsquo;s alliance with their Ascension Sect.&rdquo; Sikong Zhaixing cast a glance at Bai Ruochen, who was surrounded by the crowd, and then said those words to Chu Feng using voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;Heh, Senior Sikong, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly be wanting me to woo Bai Ruochen, right?&rdquo; An indecent smile appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br></p></div>
