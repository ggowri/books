        <div>: An Unexpected Development<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Chu Feng was still inside the ancient castle. After everyone had left, the only ones left in there were him and the Sagacious Grandmaster.<br>It was at this moment when the box floating in the air finally opened, and the treasure of the tournament fell into Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands.<br>It was a compass, an extremely small one. It fitted nicely into Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands.<br>It had an exquisite design, and all it took was one glance for Chu Feng to realize that it was extraordinary. Be it its material or the power it harnessed, it would be rare to find an equivalent in the world.<br>It was indeed a precious treasure, and it could be used to track down treasures and pinpoint the location of ancient remnants.<br>On top of that, this treasure didn&rsquo;t require spirit power to activate, so<br>even those who weren&rsquo;t world spiritists would be able to use this treasure.<br>That being said, forChu Feng who possessed Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, it was indeed not of much use.<br>Holding the treasure in his grasp, Chu Feng turned to the Sagacious Grandmaster and asked, &ldquo;Grandmaster, there&rsquo;s one thing that I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the Sagacious Grandmaster asked.<br>&ldquo;This treasure is originally yours, so why did you task me to retrieve it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Those words caused the Sagacious Grandmaster to pause for a moment before he asked, &ldquo;Young friend, what are you talking about?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was also a little surprised by the Sagacious Grandmaster&rsquo;s response.<br>Based on his deduction, the Sagacious Grandmaster should have been the mysterious expert whom he had met by the lakeside. Otherwise, why would the other party go to such lengths to protect him?<br>He had been hearing the discussions from those around, and it would appear that it was very unnatural that the Sagacious Grandmaster acted the way he did today. The other party was not someone who would go all out to protect a person unrelated to him.<br>Besides, before Chu Feng killed Zhao Xuanhe, that mysterious expert had sent a voice transmission to him, promising to protect him. Following that, the person who protected him afterward was the Sagacious Grandmaster.<br>It was due to this that Chu Feng made the link between the two.<br>But from the current reaction of the Sagacious Grandmaster, that didn&rsquo;t appear to be the case. Had he made a mistake here?<br>&ldquo;Elder, was it not you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, I see that you have come here on another person&rsquo;s request,&rdquo; the Sagacious Grandmaster remarked in realization. He chuckled softly before answering, &ldquo;You have gotten the wrong person.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My apologies, I have gotten ahead of myself.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt a little embarrassed. He didn&rsquo;t think that he would get the wrong person.<br>It was fortunate that the Sagacious Grandmaster didn&rsquo;t ask too much about it, or else Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t know how he should respond either. After all, he didn&rsquo;t know much about that mysterious expert too.<br>More importantly, it was obvious that the mysterious expert was unwilling to reveal their real identity for some reason, going to the extent of concealing their appearance and voice.<br>As such, his earlier slip-up should have been extremely problematic.<br>If the mysterious expert were to refuse to tell him the whereabouts of the black streak due to this, he would be in deep trouble.<br>&ldquo;Since you have gotten your treasure, you should take your leave now,&rdquo; the Sagacious Grandmaster said.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>Before Chu Feng could react, the Sagacious Grandmaster had already waved his sleeves.<br>In an instant, Chu Feng could sense his surroundings warping around him, and before he knew it, he was already out of the ancient castle.<br>The area outside the ancient castle was filled with huge crowds, be it in the sky or on the ground.<br>And amidst the crowd, Chu Feng immediately saw the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster and the others standing not too far away from where he was.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?!?!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance immediately caught everyone&rsquo;s attention, and their faces swiftly warped in astonishment.<br>Wasn&rsquo;t Chu Feng under the protection of the Sagacious Grandmaster? Why would he suddenly appear out here too?<br>At the same time, Chu Feng felt his heart clenching tightly together in anxiety.<br>What was going on here? What did the Sagacious Grandmaster mean by this?<br>The other party was still protecting him a moment ago, so why would the other party suddenly teleport him to where the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster and the others were?<br>Wasn&rsquo;t the other party practically delivering him right into the face of his enemies?<br>&ldquo;You beast, I&rsquo;ll kill you!!!&rdquo;<br>A furious bellow echoed in the air. Following that, an immense pulse of martial power and killing intent immediately swept right toward Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng was unable to fully gauge the extent of the martial power, but he could sense the overwhelming killing intent it possessed. He knew that if the martial power were to reach him, he would definitely die without a shred of doubt.<br>So, Chu Feng immediately shouted out for the mysterious expert to save him, &ldquo;Elder, save me!&rdquo;<br>To his surprise, a figure really appeared right before him to block down the attack of the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster. However, the one who had saved him was not the mysterious expert but the servant of the Sagacious Grandmaster, Ordinary.<br>&ldquo;Ordinary, you&rsquo;re going to go against me too?&rdquo; the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster howled with reddened eyes.<br>It was clear that he wasn&rsquo;t going to let this matter go easily.<br>&ldquo;The Sagacious Grandmaster has instructed me to escort Chu Feng out of this city safely. At least during this period of time, I won&rsquo;t allow you to lay your hands on him,&rdquo; Ordinary said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, are you going to just escort me out of this city? Can&rsquo;t you bring me a little further away than that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The Sagacious Grandmaster has only told me to escort you out of the city,&rdquo; Ordinary replied.<br>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s the point of that?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng really had no idea whether he should laugh or cry at this bizarre situation.<br>He knew that with his current strength, it would only take a single slap from the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster to utterly decimate him. Just taking the earlier assault for example, he couldn&rsquo;t even sense the attack at all. All he could perceive was the overwhelming killing intent directed toward him.<br>Had it not been for the Sagacious Grandmaster and Ordinary protecting him all this while, he would have already been dead by now.<br>Faced against such a powerful enemy, it was impossible for Chu Feng not to panic. The circumstances were simply too pessimistic to him.<br>What left Chu Feng feeling even more helpless was that the mysterious expert who had promised to help him was suddenly not responding at all. And when he tried to ask the divine deer inside of his body for help, it wasn&rsquo;t responding either.<br>This meant that he was really a helpless prey on a chopping board for the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>At this rate, as soon as the was out of this city, the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster would claim his life right away.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, it&rsquo;s time for you to leave,&rdquo; Ordinary told Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I don&rsquo;t intend to leave the city for the time being&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng tried to protest.<br>Of course he couldn&rsquo;t leave the city right now, the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster was right on his tail! Leaving this city entailed immediate death for him!<br>&ldquo;Are you finally getting scared, little beast? Do you think that you&rsquo;ll be able to delay the inevitable just by staying here? Let me tell you, even if the Sagacious Grandmaster is backing you, he can&rsquo;t protect you forever!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was refusing to leave the city, the elders and disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo began to insult him.<br>&ldquo;This young man over here, you might be talented but you lack principles. You have stolen the treasure of the Soaring Flower Gazebo and killed their disciples. Even if not for all that, you have gone too far killing Zhao Xuanhe, whom you have no personal grudge with. You have it all coming unto you.&rdquo;<br>Even the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea were criticizing Chu Feng too.<br>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t bother explaining to you just what kind of people those from the Soaring Flower Gazebo are like. Go back and listen to what Wang Yuxian and the others have to say yourselves!&rdquo; Chu Feng shot a disdainful glance at the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea.<br>Chu Feng still had a fair impression of them earlier, but gradually, seeing how they had chosen to side themselves with this bunch of human trash, his view of them was gradually worsening by the moment.<br>&ldquo;You know our little junior?&rdquo;<br>However, what that made Chu Feng a little surprised was that his mention of Wang Yuxian had caused a slight change in the expression of a person amongst the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea.<br></p></div>
