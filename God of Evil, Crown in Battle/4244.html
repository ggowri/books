        <h1>Chapter 4243</h1>
        <div> - Battle Of Glory<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lu Jie was stunned after hearing Chu Feng's words.<br>He had a completely baffled look on his face.<br>It was as if he couldn&rsquo;t believe what he had just heard.<br>That fellow who had only appeared at that moment actually dared to tell him, Lu Jie, that he wasn't qualified to challenge him?<br>&ldquo;Who do you think you are? You&rsquo;ve merely successfully challenged the Ancient Compliance Castle&rsquo;s Talent Steps. Do you really think that you&rsquo;re unrivaled in the entire world?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are countless artifacts that test one&rsquo;s talent in the martial cultivation world. But, never have I ever heard of any senior who seized power by relying on how talented they are. What martial cultivators and world spiritists rely on is actual strength.&rdquo;<br>Lu Jie&rsquo;s tone was no longer as calm as before. Everyone could tell that he had been angered by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I admit, being able to successfully challenge the Talent Steps in the Ancient Compliance Castle does not amount to much. But, at least I&rsquo;m better than someone who only dares to challenge the first step, and did not even dare to step onto the second step.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is the reason why you aren't qualified to challenge me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, disregarding everything else, merely in terms of our achievements on the Talent Steps, I&rsquo;m much superior to you.&rdquo;<br>Different from Lu Jie, Chu Feng responded with indifference, and even had a faint smile on his face.<br>His smile was filled with contempt.<br>He simply didn't place Lu Jie in his eyes at all.<br>Seeing Chu Feng acting like that, Lu Jie was so furious that the corners of his mouth started twitching.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that there were too many people there, he might&rsquo;ve attacked him directly.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s attitude had not only infuriated Lu Jie, it had also shocked the others.<br>After all, that was the renowned Lu Jie.<br>Even though he was extremely conceited, considered everyone else to be beneath him and would not even show respect to his seniors, he was still Lu Jie, the person that was renowned as the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s most outstanding world spiritist of the younger generation.<br>Lu Jie&rsquo;s reputation came not only from him being the disciple of the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.<br>He had gained his reputation with his own strength.<br>For Chu Feng to say that he wasn't qualified to challenge him, was indeed excessively arrogant.<br>But, it just so happened that the crowd were unable to reprimand Chu Feng for his attitude.<br>Ignoring the fact that Lu Jie&rsquo;s arrogance had brought dissatisfaction to the crowd, merely the fact that Chu Feng had conquered the Talent Steps&rsquo; third step was itself an unrivaled achievement.<br>Practically everyone knew how difficult the Talent Steps were. Even for those that hadn't experienced it themselves, had heard about it.<br>As such, Chu Feng&rsquo;s achievement of conquering the Talent Steps&rsquo; second and third steps was something with a lot of bearing.<br>Perhaps Chu Feng&rsquo;s current strength might be weaker than Lu Jie&rsquo;s. But, his talent most definitely surpassed Lu Jie's. Furthermore, it was not by a slight bit, but rather by a lot.<br>&ldquo;That kid is also someone with quite a personality.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, true geniuses are all haughty individuals.&rdquo;<br>Many people gave Chu Feng this sort of evaluation.<br>But, what Lu Jie and the others present didn&rsquo;t know was that Chu Feng would not have been treating Lu Jie with such an attitude had it not been for Lu Jie&rsquo;s disrespect toward Yuan Shu.<br>Chu Feng was not easily bullied. Generally, Chu Feng would always take revenge.<br>But, when someone&rsquo;s ill intention was aimed at him, Chu Feng could sometimes tolerate it<br>However, if someone aimed their ill-will at his friends, Chu Feng definitely wouldn't watch with folded arms.<br>That was the reason why Chu Feng was giving Lu Jie tit for tat.<br>&ldquo;A verbal argument is meaningless. If you&rsquo;re a man, then come and fight me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We can speak with our world spirit techniques. That&rsquo;s the way world spiritists should act,&rdquo; Lu Jie said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Listen carefully. Ignoring whether or not you&rsquo;re qualified to challenge me, the fact remains that you&rsquo;re the one challenging me. As such, I can either accept or refuse your challenge.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve trained in world spirit techniques for so many years. Yet, you&rsquo;re challenging me? Do you not think this is unfair?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could you have the shame to actually challenge me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, if you want to challenge me, that&rsquo;s simple. Go ahead and enter the Ancient Compliance Castle. Ascend the Talent Steps. If you&rsquo;re able to replace my name with your own, it&rsquo;ll be your win.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for a match in world spirit techniques&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can ask the people present whether or not that&rsquo;ll be fair.&rdquo;<br>Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, the crowd nodded in agreement.<br>Although both Chu Feng and Lu Jie were of the younger generation, Chu Feng wasn't even a hundred years old, whereas Lu Jie was much older than him.<br>In terms of fairness, it was indeed unfair for Lu Jie to challenge Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re worried about. So that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re afraid to accept my challenge.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I, Lu Jie, will not take advantage of you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will suppress my world spirit techniques to your level.&rdquo;<br>After Lu Jie said those words, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions changed.<br>If Lu Jie was really willing to do that, the difference in age could be ignored.<br>At the same level of strength, what one would compete in would be true ability. A match like that would not be unfair.<br>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I, Lu Jie, always keep my word,&rdquo; said Lu Jie.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Then, how do we confirm that you&rsquo;re suppressing your strength?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Right at that moment, a voice sounded from the direction of the Ancient Compliance Castle. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s simple. Step onto the Dragon Disclosure Stone, and your true strength will be revealed.&rdquo;<br>The crowd looked over towards the voice and were all shocked.<br>A person had appeared outside the Ancient Compliance Castle. That person was none other than Old Man Compliance.<br>Old Man Compliance was known for his eccentric nature. Very rarely did he leave the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>He was also rarely interested in the matters of the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>But, at that moment, he had not only appeared, he had even proposed a solution for the showdown.<br>Because of this, the crowd realized that Old Man Compliance was also looking forward to the showdown.<br>The crowd found this to be quite understandable.<br>One was a renowned genius of the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>The other was a supernova with unbounded talent who had conquered the Talent Steps&rsquo; third step.<br>Everyone wanted to know exactly which of them was stronger.<br>This was a battle for the glory of the strongest member of the younger generation.<br>Who wouldn&rsquo;t look forward to such a match?<br></p></div>
