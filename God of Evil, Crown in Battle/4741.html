        <h1>Chapter 4740</h1>
        <div>: Failure<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Life life life, all you know is to put your life on the line! Are you even worthy of betting your life against Senior Xu?&rdquo;<br>The others quickly spoke up for Xu Langzhi upon seeing that the latter was unable to argue against Chu Feng, though they only dared to speak up against Chu Feng because Li Muzhi clearly reserved some reservations toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s suggestion.<br>This made them think that Li Muzhi wasn&rsquo;t fond of Chu Feng either. The only reason why he wasn&rsquo;t rejecting the idea was only because he was the one who had invited Chu Feng over and was sparing him some face. They felt that they could win Li Muzhi&rsquo;s approval if they were to speak up against Chu Feng at a time like this.<br>Their doubts were further affirmed when Li Muzhi didn&rsquo;t respond to their act of criticizing Chu Feng, which made them believe that they were making the correct choice here.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going too far here. Junior Chu Feng is someone who has broken Lord Dugu Lingtian&rsquo;s record. Who else could be worthy if he&rsquo;s unworthy? Has any of you broken Lord Dugu Lingtian&rsquo;s record? Even if you might be stronger than him at the moment in terms of cultivation, that&rsquo;s only because you&rsquo;ve entered the sect ahead of him. Do you dare say that you wouldn&rsquo;t be overtaken by him in a few years&rsquo; time?&rdquo; Lu Long spoke up angrily.<br>Lu Long wasn&rsquo;t close to Chu Feng in any way, but he was an extremely righteous person. He couldn&rsquo;t stand watching these personal disciples acting all smugly just because their cultivation was a little stronger here.<br>&ldquo;Senior Lu, it&rsquo;s not our intention to make things difficult for Chu Feng either. It&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;ve put in a lot of effort into this forging. We can&rsquo;t allow the forging of the treasure to fail because of him!&rdquo;<br>The other disciples explained.<br>Lu Long turned to Li Muzhi and asked, &ldquo;Junior Li, what are your thoughts on this?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All of you are here to help me, and I consider you all my friends. So, let&rsquo;s stop arguing for the time being. I know that it has been hard on all of you over the last few days, but I believe that you can tell that we won&rsquo;t be able to finish forging the treasure prior to the opening of the Vicious Beast Hellworld at this rate. Rather than to persist on something that&rsquo;s clearly unfeasible, I think that we ought to take a gamble here.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made up my mind. Let&rsquo;s try out Junior Chu Feng&rsquo;s solution. Regardless of whether it works out or not, I&rsquo;ll accept the outcome. If anyone is unwilling to work with Junior Chu Feng, feel free to back down now. I&rsquo;ll not force you to do anything you don&rsquo;t wish to,&rdquo; Li Muzhi said.<br>&ldquo;Junior Li, what are you saying? It&rsquo;s not that we&rsquo;re unwilling to work with Junior Chu Feng. It&rsquo;s just that we don&rsquo;t wish to see the failure of the forging of the treasure after everything you&rsquo;ve done for it. However, since you&rsquo;ve already made up your mind, we&rsquo;ll heed your bidding,&rdquo; Xu Langzhi quickly said.<br>&ldquo;Senior Xu is right. We&rsquo;ll heed Junior Li&rsquo;s directives.&rdquo;<br>The others nodded in agreement too.<br>&ldquo;Since we have an agreement here, I hope that you can do your best here. However, I have a request here. If the forging succeeds based on what Junior Chu Feng mentions, I hope that you can apologize to him,&rdquo; Li Muzhi said.<br>Xu Langzhi and the others hesitated upon hearing those words, but they eventually nodded quietly. They dared not to go against Li Muzhi&rsquo;s will.<br>After that, Li Muzhi and the others worked together to remove the second formation before adding a new formation core on the forging formation so that Chu Feng could join in. Once the preparations were ready, they began channeling the forging formation once more.<br>What was different this time around was Chu Feng&rsquo;s participation. They were going to channel the forging in accordance with Chu Feng&rsquo;s method this time around, and the latter had guaranteed the success of it.<br>However, two hours soon passed, and the forging still wasn&rsquo;t complete yet. Li Muzhi and the others ran out of energy and took a quick rest. After which, they dived back into the channeling and spent yet another two more hours on the formation, but they were still unable to finish the forging.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng, didn&rsquo;t you mention that things would work out as long as we do as you said? We&rsquo;ve already tried it out twice, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like we&rsquo;re anywhere close to succeeding yet,&rdquo; Xu Langzhi sneered.<br>There was no way he was going to give up on this opportunity to mock Chu Feng.<br>As for the others, they didn&rsquo;t say a word at all, but the scornful looks they were directing toward Chu Feng said it all. They wanted to see Chu Feng embarrassed and humiliated.<br>Unexpectedly, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t appear awkward at all. He was unfazed by their remarks, and it only further infuriated them.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng, you were the one who said that things would work out as long as we did as you instructed. We&rsquo;ve already given it two tries, but nothing is happening at all. Shouldn&rsquo;t you give us an explanation here?&rdquo; one of the female disciples questioned Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy for Junior Chu Feng to control the energy coming in from the supporting formation. It&rsquo;ll take him some time to adapt to the forging process, so there&rsquo;s no need to panic just yet. Let&rsquo;s give it a few more times,&rdquo; Li Muzhi spoke up on Chu Feng&rsquo;s behalf.<br>However, Xu Langzhi didn&rsquo;t back down on Li Muzhi&rsquo;s account this time around. He continued pushing on, &ldquo;Junior Li, Chu Feng was the one who declared confidently that he would be able to do it earlier on. I didn&rsquo;t say anything when we failed the first time and gave him a second chance, but we can&rsquo;t just allow him to do as he pleases again and again!<br>&ldquo;The fact that we failed twice shows that his method doesn&rsquo;t work. Things will not work out even if we continue on trying! It took us a lot of effort to construct the second formation, but we dispelled it just because of what Chu Feng said. Even if we reconstruct it right now, we won&rsquo;t be able to make it in time anymore. We have to get Chu Feng to give a satisfactory explanation to us for this!&rdquo;<br>Even Li Muzhi was put in a spot after hearing what Xu Langzhi said.<br>He was indeed the one in command here, but Xu Langzhi and the others had put in a lot of effort to help him too. Nevertheless, he still tried to help Chu Feng out.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng has only joined us, so it&rsquo;s only normal for him to be unable to adapt to it. We&rsquo;ve already worked on this for several days now, and what&rsquo;s the harm of giving it a few more tries?&rdquo;<br>But all of a sudden, Chu Feng spoke up and said, &ldquo;Senior Li, I&rsquo;ve already adapted to this formation. The responsibility for failing to forge this treasure doesn&rsquo;t lie on me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who else is responsible if not you? Are you going to say that we&rsquo;re responsible for it instead?&rdquo; Xu Langzhi sneered.<br>&ldquo;Indeed! Are you going to pin the blame on us then? Are we the pens who suggested the dispelling of the second formation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How hilarious! I knew that he couldn&rsquo;t be trusted, and it was exactly as I'd thought! As soon as he realizes that his method doesn&rsquo;t work, he turns around and tries to shirk off responsibility! What a despicable scum he is!&rdquo;<br>Seeing how Chu Feng was unwilling to admit to his mistakes, the others also began criticizing Chu Feng too. Their attitude was far more hostile than before.<br>To make things worse, Li Muzhi and Lu Long were not in a good position to speak up for Chu Feng either. After all, he was the one who gave the guarantee earlier on.<br></p></div>
