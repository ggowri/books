        <div> - Controlling Life And Death<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>The fist and the palm collided.<br>Zhao Hong fell ten steps back.<br>As for the man, he fell several hundred steps back before barely stabilizing himself.<br>Furthermore, at that moment, the crowd were all able to see that a bright red palm imprint had appeared on his chest.<br>Everyone could tell that their confrontation had ended in Zhao Hong&rsquo;s favor.<br>&ldquo;Damn it.&rdquo;<br>Being beaten back by Zhao Hong, the man became even more furious.<br>&ldquo;Clank,&rdquo; a long sword appeared in his hand.<br>It was a top quality Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>Blue gaseous flames were emitted by the sword. The gaseous flames then fused with the man.<br>It was as if the sword had been a part of him to begin with.<br>With the sword aura fused into his body, the man&rsquo;s battle power also grew stronger.<br>Just when he was about to attack Zhao Hong again, an aged voice sounded from within the war chariot.<br>&ldquo;Lian Xi, you&rsquo;re no match for that young lady.&rdquo;<br>That voice was very peaceful, and did not contain the slightest amount of oppressive might. Yet, when it was heard, the hearts of everyone present shivered.<br>Even Chu Feng and Zhao Hong were no exception.<br>Even though they had not seen the owner of the voice and did not feel his oppressive might, they were all able to sense how powerful of an existence he was merely by his voice.<br>That person was an existence more powerful than everyone present, an existence that could easily obliterate everyone.<br>Even Zhao Hong was insignificantly weak before that person.<br>Astonishment, unease, fear&hellip; those were the emotions present in everyone&rsquo;s hearts.<br>Even though they had anticipated that those mysterious people would be very powerful, they'd not thought they would be powerful to such an extent.<br>Those mysterious people were existences they simply could not contend against.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, you all need not be too nervous. We have not come here today with ill intent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We are very thankful to you all for looking after Zhuanghong for all these years.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, after all is said and done, she does not belong here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, allow us to bring her away from this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is not only for Zhuanghong&rsquo;s sake, but also for your own sakes.&rdquo;<br>The old man&rsquo;s voice sounded from the war chariot once again.<br>He was completely different from the man outside.<br>His tone was very good-natured. It sounded like he was simply talking with the crowd.<br>However, when he spoke, the fear in the crowd&rsquo;s hearts reached its peak.<br>The oppressive sensation brought forth by the old man was many times stronger than that of the man outside.<br>Han Xiu gathered her courage to say, &ldquo;You all want to take away Zhuanghong? In that case, you&rsquo;ll have to provide us with sufficient justification for us to allow you to do so. At the very least, you need to let us know who you are.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you all are Zhuanghong&rsquo;s family, we will definitely not obstruct you in taking her away.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Zhuanghong is my disciple, and I must take responsibility for her. As such, I need to know the reason why you all want to bring her away.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At the very least, I should know why her parents abandoned her.&rdquo;<br>Even though she had realized that the opposing party were people that they could not afford to provoke, she still wanted to know the facts of the matter out of her concern for Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;Wherever we go in this Holy Light Galaxy, people always submit to us respectfully. When have we ever needed to introduce ourselves?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The fact that you all do not recognize us means that you are ignorant, and are not qualified to know who we are.&rdquo;<br>The man who had been beaten back by Zhao Hong began walking towards Yin Zhuanghong as he spoke. He intended to forcibly take her away again.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, Zhao Hong let out a cold snort and anger appeared in her eyes.<br>Zhao Hong had a fiery temper and a fearless nature. She did not care who they were.<br>If they did not explain things properly, she would not allow anyone to take Yin Zhuanghong away.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, heaven and earth began to change.<br>An enormous aura had suddenly enveloped the entire region.<br>At the moment that aura appeared, no one was able to move in the slightest. They all felt that they were about to die.<br>That aura had come from the war chariot.<br>The difference between their cultivations was simply too enormous. No one was able to determine what level of cultivation the person emitting that oppressive aura had.<br>The crowd only felt themselves to be very small and weak before that overwhelming aura. At the same time, they felt great fear.<br>Even though the aura was only restricting them and did not contain the slightest bit of killing intent, many people were still scared witless, and began sweating cold sweat. Some of the more cowardly individuals even began to cry in fear.<br>Their reactions were understandable.<br>After all, the old man inside the war chariot was simply too powerful.<br>He was capable of killing everyone present with a single thought.<br>He was truly an existence capable of determining the life and death of everyone present.<br>&ldquo;She is someone that does not belong here. Do not obstruct us.&rdquo;<br>The old man&rsquo;s voice sounded again. His voice was still very peaceful. However, the moment he unleashed his oppressive might, everyone understood that&hellip; even though he spoke with a very good-natured tone, he was just as oppressive and tyrannical as those three men.<br>Whilst all this was happening, that man had arrived before Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Seeing Zhao Hong who stood beside Yin Zhuanghong, he let out a mocking laugh.<br>Even though he was no match for her, she had been restricted by the oppressive might of the old man inside the war chariot. As such, she could only look on helplessly as the man took Yin Zhuanghong away.<br>As such, in the eyes of that man, Zhao Hong was still inferior to him.<br>That said, the man did not cause any harm to her. He also did not intend to forcibly bring Yin Zhuanghong away.<br>&ldquo;Come, leave with me,&rdquo; he said to Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who you are, I will not leave with you!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve grown up here my whole life! This place is my home!&rdquo; Yin Zhuanghong spoke angrily.<br>Compared to Han Xiu and others, she simply didn&rsquo;t care about asking about the identity of those people and whether or not they knew her parents.<br>It was clear that Yin Zhuanghong did not care about her origins at all. She only wanted to remain loyal to the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>&ldquo;Stop being foolish, you do not belong here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could a place like this be worthy of being your home?&rdquo; said that man.<br>&ldquo;Please leave. I do not care who you all might be, I will not be leaving with you.&rdquo; Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s attitude was very resolute.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really not leaving?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not leaving, I&rsquo;ll kill everyone here.&rdquo;<br>The man&rsquo;s tone changed. It was one filled with threat.<br>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the strong-willed Yin Zhuanghong was suddenly stunned.<br>She knew the man was not joking. They were indeed capable of killing everyone present.<br>&ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s go. Consider it to be for their sake.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t possibly want to watch them all die before you, right?&rdquo;<br>As the man spoke, he grabbed Yin Zhaunghong&rsquo;s arm.<br>Then, he pulled her towards the war chariot.<br>Yin Zhuanghong did not struggle. She hadn&rsquo;t given in. It was just that she was afraid that she would implicate Han Xiu and others should she attempt to struggle.<br>Seeing Yin Zhuanghong being forcibly pulled away, even though the people from the Red-dress Holy Land were very unwilling, no one said anything.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that they did not want to stop them. It was simply that, as matters stood, they knew very well that they were simply unable to stop those people.<br>Even if they attempted to stop them, it would all be for naught.<br>If they truly ended up provoking those people, their Red-dress Holy Land might cease to exist from that day forward.<br>&ldquo;Release her!&rdquo;<br>Right when the crowd had all given in to fate, a voice sounded in the sky.<br>Looking towards the voice, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions changed. Even the three men were no exception. In fact, compared to others, the surprise in the eyes of those three men was even more intense.<br>The reason for that was because the person who had let out that shout was Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
