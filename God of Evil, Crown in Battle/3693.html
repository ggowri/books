        <div> - Fire Qilin Talisman<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Thus, from now on, you must address me as big sister,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said to Chu Feng in a very complacent manner.<br>Why?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt somewhat puzzled.<br>&ldquo;Have you forgotten? The two of us have made a promise that whoever is stronger will be the elder one.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;m stronger than you, you should address me as big sister,&rdquo; said Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;When was there such a promise? How come I don&rsquo;t remember it?&rdquo; Chu Feng frowned. He had no impression of the matter at all.<br>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve nearly forgotten. I dreamed of that promise whilst I was training,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi suddenly revealed an embarrassed smile.<br>&ldquo;Say girl, you shouldn&rsquo;t bully someone like this, no? That&rsquo;s your own dream, how could that count?&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke with a look of helplessness.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I was muddle-headed. That dream was simply too realistic, so much that I thought it had actually happened.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, you cannot blame me for it. You also understand that sometimes its very difficult to determine what are illusions and what are real while one&rsquo;s in closed-door training,&rdquo; said Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, I forgive you,&rdquo; Chu Feng waved his hand indifferently. Then, he continued to walk.<br>With her hands behind her back, Chu Lingxi skipped after Chu Feng, &ldquo;But, you still have to address me as big sister.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean by why? I&rsquo;m older than you to begin with. Judging by our ages, you should be addressing me as big sister,&rdquo; said Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Is that so? You&rsquo;re older than me?&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed a confused look.<br>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m older than you,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi raised her chest and lifted her head. With her hands on her waist, she appeared particularly serious.<br>Subconsciously, Chu Feng lowered his gaze from her face.<br>&ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi spoke with a glare.<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip; cough cough&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not talk about age. Instead, let&rsquo;s talk about the way you look.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You look much younger than me. How could I address you as big sister?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about this: let us do away with the seniority. You can just address me as Chu Feng,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Then what are you going to address me as?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll address you as little sister Lingxi,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Scram!&rdquo; Chu Lingxi raised her fist and shot forth a punch.<br>&ldquo;Woah! Help! I&rsquo;m getting beaten up! A little sister is beating her big brother!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng avoided Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s attack and began to shout as he laughed.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big sister beating up her little brother,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi corrected. She was also smiling brilliantly.<br>&ldquo;I am your big brother. Earlier, you were calling me big brother. That&rsquo;s something that everyone heard,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>[1. Yes, Chu Lingxi was addressing Chu Feng as big brother since she came back with her mother. I thought wtf because that&rsquo;s not how she spoke back then and she&rsquo;s clearly some 15 years or so older than Chu Feng. So I ended up dropping the big brother part. Apologies.]<br>&ldquo;Pah! I was muddle-headed from my dream. Damn it! Did you really just accept it just because I addressed you as such? How shameless could you be?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi chased after Chu Feng and began beating him up even more ferociously.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, you&rsquo;re a grown woman, is this how you should behave?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a figure appeared and blocked Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s path. It was Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;Mother, how could you criticize me? Why didn&rsquo;t you say anything when I addressed Chu Feng as big brother earlier?&rdquo; asked Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;How could I know what sort of relationship the two of you possess?&rdquo; said Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re standing on his side! You&rsquo;re my mother!&rdquo; complained Chu Lingxi.<br>Gu Mingyuan ignored Chu Lingxi. Instead, she looked to Chu Feng. &ldquo;Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, I never bullied little sister Lingxi,&rdquo; Chu Feng immediately explained.<br>Hearing those words, Gu Mingyuan revealed a faint smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested in the business between the two of you. I have something else that I need to talk to you about.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, what is it?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;The people of the younger generation all rely on treasures to increase their cultivation. You, on the other hand, do not possess such a treasure. Because of that, you are disadvantaged against them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Here, take this,&rdquo; as Gu Mingyuan spoke, she handed a jade pendant to Chu Feng.<br>The pendant was completely red. It seemed to be made of flames, and looked very beautiful.<br>The pedant was extremely extraordinary. It contained an extremely strong Exalted-level martial power.<br>Just by looking at the pendant, Chu Feng knew that it was a treasure capable of increasing his cultivation.<br>Furthermore, the pendant was of excellent quality. It was a treasure of the highest quality.<br>&ldquo;This jade pendant is called the Fire Qilin Talisman.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are able to fuse with it, you will be able to increase your cultivation by a level whilst you&rsquo;re an Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, one can only rely on oneself on the path of martial cultivation. The power of this treasure is, ultimately, limited. Should your cultivation surpass the Exalted realm, it will lose its effect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That holds true for not only that Fire Qilin Talisman. Lingxi&rsquo;s Ancient Clan&rsquo;s Inner Armor also can only help her in the Exalted realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s Cyan Nethersoul that he spent such effort to fuse with is the same. Its effect is limited to the Exalted realm. Upon surpassing the Exalted realm, it will lose its effect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although the effect will ultimately be lost, at least they are still useful in the Exalted realm. As they possess such treasures, you should have one too,&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this treasure of yours is simply too precious.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had already realized how useful treasures were after fighting against Nangong Yifan and the others.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor could only increase his cultivation by two levels.<br>Nangong Yifan and the others, on the other hand, were capable of increasing their cultivations by three levels.<br>The reason why they were able to increase their cultivations by a level more than him was because they had treasures capable of increasing their cultivations by a level.<br>Chu Feng, on the other hand, did not possess such a treasure.<br>It was as Gu Mingyuan had said, he was at a disadvantage against them.<br>However, treasures like those were simply priceless. This was especially true in regards to the Fire Qilin Talisman Gu Mingyuan held in her hand. Chu Feng could tell how precious it was. Likely, it was even more precious than ordinary treasures. It was truly a priceless treasure.<br>&ldquo;During my youth, I coincidentally entered a mysterious realm with your father.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This Fire Qilin Talisman was obtained from that mysterious realm. However, it is not because of my own strength that I obtained this Fire Qilin Talisman. Instead, it was because of your father.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have always wanted to return this Fire Qilin Talisman to him. Unfortunately, I never had the chance to do so.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Giving it to you today could be considered returning it to its rightful owner,&rdquo; said Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you should just accept it. What my mother said is true. That pendant truly belongs to your father,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi added.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are destined to battle Linghu Hongfei again. You need it,&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan said.<br>What Gu Mingyuan said was precisely what Chu Feng was thinking.<br>Chu Feng had a premonition that business between him and Linghu Hongfei was still unfinished.<br>Sooner or later, they would fight again. Chu Feng did not know what sort of abilities Linghu Hongfei would possess then.<br>However, without a doubt, he needed more abilities capable of increasing his strength in order to defeat him.<br>&ldquo;Senior, thank you.&rdquo;<br>Ultimately, Chu Feng accepted the Fire Qilin Talisman.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to thank me. This is something that belonged to your father to begin with. You can consider it as me giving it to you on behalf of your father,&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; suddenly, Gu Mingyuan spoke using voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng realized that Gu Mingyuan had something very important to tell him.<br></p></div>
