        <div> - How Could I?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Chu Feng was able to understand their reaction. They had most definitely thought that Chu Feng would suffer once Chu Xianshuo arrived.<br>Chu Feng knew what they were thinking. However, they had no idea exactly how powerful Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques were.<br>&hellip;....<br>After roughly half a day passed, a brilliant radiance began to emerge from afar.<br>Following that brilliant radiance was an enormous power. A power was so strong, it even shook the earth.<br>The closer that light got, the more the earth trembled.<br>Through his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to clearly see that within the golden radiance were the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>It was possible that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations captured by Chu Feng had sent out distress signals.<br>That might be the reason why those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations came prepared.<br>The reason why Chu Feng thought that they came prepared was because they practically all came together.<br>How could there be such a coincidence?<br>There could only be one explanation as to why they would all arrive at the same time. That is, they had gathered beforehand.<br>At that moment, they came majestically, not merely to see their friends, but more so that they could take care of Chu Feng.<br>As expected, once they saw the arrival of the magnificent radiance, those ten Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations standing behind Chu Feng all revealed joyous expressions.<br>In fact, they would even stare at Chu Feng from behind every now and then.<br>It was as if they were trying to tell Chu Feng, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re going to suffer soon. Watch how we&rsquo;ll take care of you later.&rsquo;<br>Not long afterward, all of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations had arrived.<br>They were all standing atop a grand formation that resembled a giant lotus flower.<br>That grand formation was a movement formation. The golden radiance was emitted by that grand formation.<br>Through the spirit power and the veined patterns flowing through the grand formation, Chu Feng was able to tell that there was an Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist among them.<br>&ldquo;Brat, is it you who caused this?!&rdquo;<br>Soon, a person stood forth from the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations that had arrived.<br>He was a very handsome man. His face was fair like snow. Even his skin was extremely glossy and smooth.<br>At a glance, he simply resembled a woman. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that his voice was clearly that of a man, many people would likely have mistaken him for a woman.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell that the movement formation shining brightly with golden light was set up by that man.<br>That person was most likely the person with the strongest world spirit techniques among the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations present at the moment.<br>However, Chu Xianshuo was not there.<br>&ldquo;Where is Chu Xianshuo?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>The little pretty boy pointed at Chu Feng and ordered, &ldquo;I am the one questioning you here! Answer honestly!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If Chu Xianshuo doesn&rsquo;t show up, I&rsquo;m afraid that you all will likely end up like them today,&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed to the ten Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations behind him.<br>&ldquo;What are you trying to say?!&rdquo; The little pretty boy asked.<br>&ldquo;Like them, you will all be defeated by me,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled lightly.<br>&ldquo;Courting death!&rdquo;<br>The man was immediately furious. As he spoke, he formed an enormous slaughtering formation and unleashed it toward Chu Feng to attack him.<br>While he unleashed his attack at Chu Feng, he was actually even shouting loudly, forcefully and righteously, &ldquo;You who dared to attack the people of our Chu Heavenly Clan have committed a capital offense! Today&hellip; I, Chu Chengkun, will execute you on the spot!&rdquo;<br>Chu Chengkun&rsquo;s voice was very resounding. Furthermore, his oppressive might was radiating all around. His voice carried his awe-inspiring might into the crowd&rsquo;s ears, causing them to feel a sort of fear.<br>It was as if he were the law, and what he had declared would all become reality.<br>However, right after his voice entered the crowd&rsquo;s ears, Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and that ferocious slaughtering formation turned into rays of golden light that dispersed into thin air.<br>&ldquo;This!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could this be?!&rdquo;<br>Witnessing this scene, not only was that pretty boy stunned, but even the ten Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations who had attacked Chu Feng earlier were stunned.<br>None of them had expected Chu Feng to be so overwhelmingly powerful.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re capable of using your martial power?&rdquo;<br>That little pretty face uttered the same sort of question those ten Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations did earlier.<br>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Then you possess a treasure?&rdquo; The little pretty boy asked again.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it either,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Impossible. You most definitely possess some sort of treasure. Else, how could you, how could you possibly disperse my attack with a mere gesture?&rdquo; That man asked.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking me how? Very well, I shall allow you all to know exactly how I managed to do it.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he waved his sleeve again.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, surging spirit power emerged from Chu Feng&rsquo;s sleeve. Like glorious sunshine, it immediately enveloped the entire region.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were completely stunned.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng was not utilizing any special formations. Instead, he was directly displaying his spirit power.<br>Thus, all the people present were able to clearly see the brilliant light that enveloped the region.<br>It was&hellip; Snake Mark Immortal level spirit power.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; you&rsquo;re a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>That little pretty face reacted as if he did not dare to believe what he had just witnessed. He asked Chu Feng again, seemingly to verify what he had seen.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already said to call that Chu Xianshuo over. Else&hellip; you will all end up like them.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he grasped his palm. Then, like a magnificent army that had just been given a command, the spirit power that sealed the region began to move to oppress the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations present.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>In merely an instant, all of those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were forced to the ground.<br>&ldquo;You dare attack us?! Are you trying to die?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, that little pretty boy and the rest of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations that had arrived with him all began to curse and threaten Chu Feng. The tones of their voices were exactly the same as those of the ten Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations from earlier.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anymore, quickly, stop talking! He really will kill us. He simply does not fear our Chu Heavenly Clan!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, those ten Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were unable to contain themselves. One by one, they shouted for the rest to quiet down.<br>After hearing the shouts from the ten Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations that had arrived later were first stunned. Then, they all closed their mouths.<br>They all knew very well what sort of personality those ten Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations possessed. They were not people that would submit to another easily.<br>Yet, they were actually speaking in such a manner and reacting in such a frightened manner.<br>There could only be one explanation for this. That is, the Chu Feng before them would really kill them.<br>&ldquo;The one who attacked you back then is Chu Xianshuo. It is unrelated to us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if you want to settle the debt and take revenge, you should find Chu Xianshuo,&rdquo; that little pretty boy said.<br>Compared to the others, he was quite quick-witted.<br>He did not directly beg for forgiveness. Instead, he pushed the blame to Chu Xianshuo.<br>Of course, what he had done was an act of betrayal for the sake of self-preservation.<br>Although that pretty boy was quick-witted, his moral character was inferior to even those ten Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations from before.<br>&ldquo;Go and call Chu Xianshuo over, and I will settle my debt with him,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;It is not that I do not want to help you call him over. Merely, big brother Chu Xianshuo is simply not in the hunting grounds,&rdquo; that little pretty boy said.<br>&ldquo;Not in the hunting grounds?&rdquo; Chu Feng was surprised.<br><br><br></p></div>
