        <div> - What&rsquo;s Happened?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;This backlash is truly powerful.&rdquo;<br>After Grandmaster Feng You examined Chu Feng&rsquo;s condition, he narrowed his brows.<br>Seeing such a reaction from someone like Grandmaster Feng You, Zhao Hong and others became even more uneasy.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, perhaps you can try using this.&rdquo;<br>Just when the people around Chu Feng were at their wits&rsquo; end, a voice sounded.<br>Looking over, a figure could be seen treading on the air and walking over.<br>It was the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. He had actually left with the Miao Heavenly Clansmen earlier. However, at that moment he'd returned and even held an item in his hand. Evidently, he had returned for Chu Feng&rsquo;s sake.<br>As for the item the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief held in his hand, it was a medicinal herb -- a ginseng.<br>Whilst it was a ginseng, it looked like a piece of jade. It possessed a magnificently beautiful appearance, and emitted a very strong medicinal aroma.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Miao, are you really planning to use it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Asura&rsquo;s backlash is very serious. If you are to truly use your Ancient Era&rsquo;s Revival Ginseng, its spiritual energy will likely be sucked dry, rendering it useless,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Feng You.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, saving a life is of the utmost importance. Please, go ahead and use it,&rdquo; said the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Very well. You can leave the matter to this old man.&rdquo;<br>After hearing the response from the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Grandmaster Feng You realized his intentions.<br>Thus, he began using his world spirit techniques to cautiously extract the spiritual energies from the ginseng and use them to replenish Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>Han Xiu did not recognize the ginseng. However, after she saw the spiritual energy entering Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, and how his withered body began to rejuvenate and his appearance recovering, she knew that the ginseng was most definitely of extraordinary origin.<br>&ldquo;As expected of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Revival Ginseng. It is truly capable of bringing someone back from the verge of death.&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura recovering, the Mystic Cave Saints were overjoyed, and began to praise it nonstop.<br>They all knew about the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Revival Ginseng.<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Revival Ginseng was a medicine especially used to treat people suffering from a backlash.<br>Furthermore, it was said to be miraculously effective.<br>However, it was something from the Ancient Era, and extremely rare.<br>How rare was it?<br>It was so rare that even the Mystic Cave Saints, although deeply wanting to obtain one, had never been able to obtain one even with their abilities.<br>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s recovery, Zhao Hong bowed respectfully at the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>After recovering her memories, Zhao Hong also had an impression of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Revival Ginseng. However, even in her memories, she had only heard about the ginseng and had never seen it before.<br>Because of that, she knew very well how precious the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Revival Ginseng was.<br>For the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to be willing to use that item, he was most definitely sacrificing a lot.<br>Most importantly, the ginseng had saved Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young Hero Asura was totally capable of killing us today. Yet, he was benevolent enough to spare our lives. I, Miao, will forever engrave his kindness in my heart.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, Young Hero Asura possesses exceptional talent, and is a rare genius. If he is to truly fall like this today, it would be a great misfortune for us cultivators.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for this ginseng of mine, it is an item to save others. It could be considered to be this Miao&rsquo;s honor to be able to save Young Hero Asura with it,&rdquo; the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Miao is truly a virtuous person. I, Feng You, feel great admiration.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Feng You actually clasped his hand and bowed respectfully to Clan Chief Miao.<br>&ldquo;Us brothers will remember your kindness.&rdquo; The Mystic Cave Saints patted their chests.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, there&rsquo;s no need for all this courtesy. I, Miao, brought this ginseng over to return the favor to Young Hero Asura. It is most definitely not for anything else. Since the ginseng was effective, this Miao will be taking his leave.&rdquo; The Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief clasped his fist and bowed respectfully. Then, he turned around and left.<br>Actually, everyone knew that the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s decision to come to Chu Feng&rsquo;s aid at such a time, especially when they'd had conflicts earlier, was because he wanted to befriend Zhao Hong, Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>He was also very smart. After helping Chu Feng, he did not make any demands. This made him appear very magnanimous.<br>However, it was as the Mystic Cave Saints had said, all of them had remembered the kindness he had shown them.<br>Chu Feng had also witnessed this. He too remembered the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief coming to his aid.<br>Chu Feng was originally conscious. He was maintaining his consciousness with sheer willpower.<br>He knew that he had to keep himself awake. He knew that if he decided to sleep, his soul would scatter, and he would die.<br>Now that his condition was stabilized, Chu Feng was finally able to relax.<br>As such, overwhelmed with exhaustion, Chu Feng quickly fell unconscious.<br>When he opened his eyes again, they had already left the All-heaven Sect.<br>Chu Feng had returned to the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>He was laying on a bed.<br>There were two people inside the room. One was Yin Zhuanghong, and the other was Zhao Hong.<br>The both of them stood by his bedside. Thus, they were immediately discovered when he woke up.<br>&ldquo;Asura, you&rsquo;ve awakened.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How do you feel? Are you alright?&rdquo;<br>Yin Zhuanghong became very emotional the moment Chu Feng woke up.<br>Seeing Ying Zhuanghong like that, Chu Feng revealed a faint smile.<br>&ldquo;Rarely do I see you act like this.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Yin Zhaunghong seemed to realize something. Her little face turned red, and she wanted to explain, but didn&rsquo;t know how.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that he&rsquo;s fine now. You can withdraw for now,&rdquo; said Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br>Yin Zhaunghong bowed and hurriedly left. However, when she pushed open the door to the room, she was unable to keep herself from taking a glance at Chu Feng. Seeing that he had sat up, the worry in her eyes finally dulled. With that, she left with ease.<br>&ldquo;That girl is truly quite worried about you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still the same as before, still able to gain the affection of young girls.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you&rsquo;ve created a lot of love affairs again in the days that we were separated.&rdquo;<br>Zhao Hong looked at Chu Feng and ridiculed him with a smile on her face.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean by love affairs? Am I someone like that?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled wryly. He felt that Zhao Hong seemed to have some sort of misunderstanding about him.<br>&ldquo;Then&hellip; what about that guy? Has he been messing around?&rdquo; asked Zhao Hong.<br>The &lsquo;guy&rsquo; that Zhao Hong spoke of was naturally Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Right now, even if he wanted to mess around, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Why do you say that? Could it be that he&rsquo;s in some sort of trouble?&rdquo; Although Zhao Hong appeared calm on the surface after hearing those words, her tone and her gaze clearly revealed how deeply worried she was.<br>She was very worried about Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story. Let me slowly tell you in detail.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng then began to explain to Zhao Hong how they had been separated on their journey to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, and how he ended up encountering Wang Qiang at the Void Sacred Tree.<br>Of course, to keep Zhao Hong from worrying, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t tell her about how dangerous that Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was. He naturally also didn&rsquo;t tell her how the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted had tried to kill him.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined my husband to be so fortunate.&rdquo;<br>After learning that Wang Qiang was fine, and that he'd obtained a favorable opportunity, Zhao Hong&rsquo;s face turned into one of joy.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about you. Exactly what did you experience all this time?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, what&rsquo;s your relationship with Han Xiu?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng was very curious about Zhao Hong&rsquo;s experience.<br></p></div>
