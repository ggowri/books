        <div> - Handling Chu Feng<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>In terms of having an ugly expression on their face, the one with the ugliest expression would be none other than Han Yu.<br>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this? Are you trying to deliberately make things difficult for me?&rdquo; An enormous amount of resentment emerged in his eyes. Even his voice had grown much louder.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder asked.<br>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you mention this rule when I lost my glass ball to Chu Feng earlier?&rdquo; Han Yu asked.<br>&ldquo;One can present the glass ball to another as a gambling bet. However, one cannot use it as currency in a transaction,&rdquo; that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such a rule? Who are you trying to deceive?&rdquo; Han Yu spoke in a very unaccepting manner.<br>&ldquo;Young master Han Yu, these are the rules. This old man is merely doing things according to the rules. Thus, I hope that young master Han Yu will follow the rules too, and not make things difficult for this old man,&rdquo; that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br>At that moment, the crowd all looked at one another. After all, even fools could tell that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder was deliberately making things difficult for Han Yu.<br>At that moment, many people began to worry for Han Yu. With how that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder was acting against him, they feared that he would likely not be able to enter Buried Spirit Lake.<br>&ldquo;Very well, I will act according to the rules then,&rdquo; Han Yu nodded his head while gnashing his teeth furiously. Then, he walked over to the chessboard again. He said, &ldquo;Is there anyone that is willing to play a round of chess with this Han Yu? If you are to lose, you can use your glass ball as the gambling stake.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, he added, &ldquo;I, Han Yu, will remember this kindness.&rdquo;<br>Seeing Han Yu&rsquo;s reaction, many people started to praise him in their hearts. They felt that he was truly intelligent.<br>&ldquo;Me! Brother Han Yu, I am willing to gamble with you.&rdquo;<br>At that moment there were many people present that stepped toward the chessboard. They were actually starting to fight over who got to gamble with Han Yu.<br>That being said, even though they were calling it a gamble, it was clearly an act to present their glass ball to Han Yu free of charge.<br>This was a normal reaction. After all, with Han Yu&rsquo;s reputation in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, there were a lot of people who longed to befriend him.<br>And now, the opportunity to do so had actually emerged before them. Naturally, the crowd would not want to miss that opportunity.<br>&ldquo;The glass balls are not allowed to be used as gambling stakes. If you do not wish to enter the mountain, you can leave voluntarily. However, you must leave your glass ball behind,&rdquo; Right at that moment, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder spoke again.<br>The people that were proceeding toward the chessboard immediately stopped.<br>They were at a complete loss as to what to do.<br>&ldquo;There are no grievances or hatred between you and I, why must you deliberately make things difficult for me like this?&rdquo; Han Yu turned to ask that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, you are simply conducting an act of intolerable bullying,&rdquo; Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi added.<br>It was not only the three of them that felt that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder was deliberately making things difficult for Han Yu. A great majority of the people all felt that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder was deliberately making things difficult for Han Yu. After all, this was simply too obvious.<br>Earlier, he had said that the glass balls could be used as gambling stakes. Yet now, he said that they were not allowed to be used as gambling stakes. He was clearly targeting Han Yu.<br>&ldquo;This old man does not understand how I am making things difficult for you. This old man has only been following the rules,&rdquo; that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder had an innocent expression on his face. He was acting as if he truly did not know what he had done wrong.<br>&ldquo;You said earlier that the glass balls could be used as gambling stakes. Why is it that they cannot be used as gambling stakes now?&rsquo; Han Yu asked.<br>&ldquo;Oh, so that&rsquo;s the question. I can answer your question.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When you were competing with little friend Chu Feng earlier, betting one&rsquo;s glass ball was indeed allowed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it is not allowed now,&rdquo; that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo; At that moment, Han Yu was so furious that he was on the verge of vomiting blood.<br>This was simply too much of a deliberate ruse of making things difficult for someone. Furthermore, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder was deliberately making things difficult for him so obviously. He was simply against Han Yu.<br>Even if someone was to be deliberately making things difficult for another, there would never be one to do it this openly and obviously.<br>&ldquo;I demand to see the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, I demand to see your clan chief!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is simply too excessive. You are simply too excessive!<br>&ldquo;I demand to see your clan chief!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who the hell do you think I, Han Yu, am?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you really think that I, Han Yu, am someone who&rsquo;s easily bullied and humiliated?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I demand to see your Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief! You all must provide me with an explanation!&rdquo;<br>Han Yu exploded. He started to let out loud and ear-piercing shouts.<br>He was truly and utterly enraged by that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder.<br>He must definitely get justice for himself.<br>&ldquo;Little friend, do you need something?&rdquo;<br>Han Yu had only shouted a couple times before an enormous figure appeared in the palace hall.<br>That person was none other than the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>After that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief appeared, Han Yu&rsquo;s furious expression finally eased.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, this elder of yours, for some unknown reason, is deliberately making things difficult for me. I hope that Lord Clan Chief is able to uphold justice for this junior,&rdquo; Han Yu greeted the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and then reported his grievances.<br>&ldquo;Oh? There&rsquo;s such a thing?&rdquo; The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief took a glance at that elder. Then, he said to Han Yu, &ldquo;How has he been making things difficult for you?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, joy emerged in Han Yu&rsquo;s eyes. Then, he began to narrate in full detail what had happened to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>After Han Yu finished reporting the matter, many of the people present felt that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder was going to suffer.<br>The reason for that was because the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan had always been a very strict race. They had to follow the rules established by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief absolutely. If someone dared to go against it, they would definitely be punished. In more serious cases, they would even be executed on the spot.<br>&ldquo;Oh? So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re concerned about. This is an order that I had transmitted to him,&rdquo; the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke indifferently.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually your order?&rdquo; Han Yu&rsquo;s expression changed greatly.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, it is my order,&rdquo; the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>At that moment, the crowd all came to a realization. It turned out that it was not the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder who wanted to deliberately make things difficult for Han Yu. Instead, it was the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief himself.<br>But, why was he doing this? Exactly what did Han Yu do to offend the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to make him target him so obviously?<br>At that moment, the crowd began to guess nonstop. As for Han Yu, he stood there speechlessly for a very long time.<br>&ldquo;Puuu~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Han Yu opened his mouth, and a large mouthful of blood sprayed out. Following that, he took several steps back and nearly fell to the ground.<br>Han Yu was actually enraged to a state of vomiting blood. Not only that, but his complexion had turned paper pale. He was simply akin to a dying man. It was a very shocking appearance.<br>&ldquo;Very well. I, Han Yu, will remember what has happened here today.&rdquo;<br>Han Yu coldly left those words and wiped away the blood at the corner of his mouth and on his clothes. Then, he did not bother to utter another word to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clans&rsquo; clansmen and turned his gaze to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, oh Chu Feng, I have truly underestimated you. Never would I have expected that you were this cunning, that you actually possessed the backing of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Haha, I was a fool to actually believe you when you said that you were from the Lower Realms earlier.&rdquo;<br>After Han Yu finished saying those words, he proceeded toward the direction that they had arrived from. He was planning to leave.<br>The reason for that was because it was not only that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder who was making things difficult for him. Instead, it was the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. At that moment, he was powerless to do anything. He must endure the humiliation regardless of whether or not he wanted to. Even though Han Yu was so furious that he felt his heart, liver, spleen and lungs were all about to explode, he could only endure this anger.<br>After all, this was the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s territory.<br>Seeing that Han Yu was planning to leave, the people from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan did not attempt to stop him.<br>It was actually Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi that rushed toward Han Yu. The two of them wanted to leave with him.<br>&ldquo;Why are the two of you following me?&rdquo; Han Yu asked through a voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;This Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan is simply bullying you intolerably. We will leave with you,&rdquo; Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi said.<br>&ldquo;While I cannot enter, the two of you are still able to enter. As long as you enter, you will have the opportunity to take care of Chu Feng. Are the two of you planning to miss out on this opportunity?&rdquo; Han Yu asked through another voice transmission.<br>Hearing those words, Yuwen Hualong and Yuwen Tingyi&rsquo;s expressions both changed.<br>They suddenly recalled that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan would not concern themselves with the battles of others in the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain.<br>Every year, there would be conflicts within the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain. In fact, there were people who lost their lives in there.<br>After entering the maze formation, if they were to encounter Chu Feng, it would truly be a great opportunity to take care of him.<br>&ldquo;But, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan will most definitely be monitoring the maze formation. If they are truly determined to protect Chu Feng, the two of us will be powerless to do anything,&rdquo; Yuwen Hualong said though voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;That is indeed possible. However, even with that possibility, the two of you must still try. This is still a rare opportunity,&rdquo; Han Yu said.<br><br><br>Check out the June Giveaway for a chance to win $200, $100 or $50 Visa Gift Card<br><br><br></p></div>
