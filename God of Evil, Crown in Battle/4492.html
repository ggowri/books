        <h1>Chapter 4491</h1>
        <div>: Talent<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The young man also noticed that something was amiss. Even though he was the one with superior fighting prowess here, Chu Feng had a way with attacking from angles that threw him off his momentum.<br>Unless he were to use martial skills, he would surely lose at this rate.<br>However, he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to use his martial skills. He felt that doing so was no different from admitting his defeat.<br>As a result, the tides of the battle gradually moved over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side, resulting in the young man being cornered further.<br>Shoosh!<br>All of a sudden, the wooden stick in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands darted right toward the young man&rsquo;s neck with frightening momentum.<br>Knowing that it would be bad if he were to be struck by that attack, the young man quickly backed away.<br>But in the next moment, the trajectory of the wooden stick&rsquo;s swing suddenly altered and fell toward the young man&rsquo;s wrist instead.<br>&ldquo;This is bad!&rdquo;<br>The young man realized that he had been tricked. The earlier attack was just a feint; Chu Feng&rsquo;s real target was his wrist!<br>By the time he realized this, it was already too late for him to do anything.<br>Pah!<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s wooden stick struck the young man&rsquo;s wrist with such great strength that the wooden stick he was holding onto ended up flying out.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s offense didn&rsquo;t stop there. Making use of this momentary opening of the young man, he swiftly followed up with yet another strike directed toward the young man&rsquo;s dantian.<br>The young man immediately knew that it was impossible for him to dodge this attack, so he hurriedly released the suppression on his cultivation, causing his cultivation to swiftly revert back to Martial Exalted level.<br>It was just that in the same moment as he regained his cultivation, Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack had also come to a halt. From the start, he had never intended to follow through with the attack.<br>&ldquo;Brother, I&rsquo;m grateful for your leniency.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng dissipated the wooden stick in his grasp and clasped his fist toward the young man.<br>However, the young man&rsquo;s complexion didn&rsquo;t look too good at the moment. He was unable to accept the fact that he had lost to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Cough cough. A loss is a loss. Don&rsquo;t embarrass me here,&rdquo; the old man spoke up.<br>Hearing that, the young man turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve underestimated you. We&rsquo;ll count this match as your victory. However, you should know that I was only playing around you after having suppressed my cultivation. Otherwise, in a real fight, I would have crushed your soul before you could do anything at all!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right. I have taken advantage of you today,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>Seeing how Chu Feng was accepting all of his comments with a smile, the young man found that there was nothing more he could say. So, he harrumphed coldly before falling silent.<br>&ldquo;Elder, if there&rsquo;s nothing else, I&rsquo;ll be taking my leave,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist and bade the old man farewell.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment. Do you not intend to take this away with you?&rdquo;<br>The old man reached his hand forth, and the waterlike pearl that was absorbing the hidden energies all around fell into his hand.<br>&ldquo;Elder, do you really intend to give it to me?&rdquo;<br>It was not that Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t want to have the pearl, but he didn&rsquo;t dare to claim it even though it was part of their earlier bet.<br>&ldquo;Of course. However, I have a condition. You have to clear my test first before I&rsquo;ll give this pearl to you. Don&rsquo;t say that I didn&rsquo;t hold the end of my promise; after all, if you were to fight my disciple in a proper battle, you wouldn&rsquo;t have been a match for him at all.<br>&ldquo;You might have won the fight, but it wasn&rsquo;t a fair battle. Naturally, my promise to allow you to leave together with the pearl doesn&rsquo;t hold either. However, I am not an unreasonable person, so I&rsquo;m willing to give you another chance. As long as you can clear my test, I&rsquo;ll give the pearl to you,&rdquo; the old man told Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I&rsquo;m grateful to the generosity you have shown to me, but the pearl belongs to you. I dare not lay claim to a possession of yours.&rdquo;<br>At this very moment, Chu Feng only wanted to get out of this place as quickly as possible. He had noticed that these two were just fooling around with him.<br>He was nothing more than their plaything.<br>If they were in a good mood, they might choose to let Chu Feng off. If they were in a bad mood, they could obliterate him from the face of the world with a wave of their sleeves.<br>&ldquo;Brat, are you trying to turn down my goodwill?&rdquo;<br>Even though Chu Feng had tried to turn the old man down humbly, the old man&rsquo;s face still turned livid after hearing his words.<br>At the same time, Chu Feng suddenly felt the area around him turning unbearably chilly. It was as if the hostility of the world was suddenly directed toward him.<br>This was a blatant threat toward him.<br>Chu Feng had no say at all. He could only abide by the arrangements of the old man.<br>&ldquo;Elder, may I know what kind of test it is?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be competing with me. If you can defeat me, I&rsquo;ll give the pearl to you,&rdquo; the old man said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, are you intending to lower your cultivation to fight with me too?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a hint of disbelief in his tone.<br>&ldquo;Nay, how boring would that be? It would be meaningless even if I were to win you in a fight. Since we&rsquo;re going to compete with one another, we should do something more fun. How about&hellip; pitting our bloodline against one another?&rdquo; the old man said.<br>&ldquo;Pit our bloodline against one another? How does that work?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Simple. I have an item here that is used to assess the strength of one&rsquo;s bloodline,&rdquo; the old man said as he took out a wooden elliptical object.<br>This object had a lot of small holes in it, but it was impossible to peer into it.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll infuse your consciousness into this object and channel your bloodline power into it. I&rsquo;ll be doing the same as well, and you should be able to feel some pressure coming from my bloodline power. To put it simply, we&rsquo;ll be using our bloodline power to suppress each other.<br>&ldquo;Lest you say that I am taking advantage of you, I don&rsquo;t expect you to defeat me with your bloodline power. That would be asking too much of you. As long as you can withstand my bloodline power for an incense&rsquo;s time, I&rsquo;ll consider it as your victory.<br>&ldquo;Not only will I allow you to leave this place, but that pearl will be yours to take too,&rdquo; the old man said.<br>&ldquo;I understand. Elder, I&rsquo;ll go with your arrangements.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng began to infuse his consciousness into the object. Soon, he sensed mysterious energy within the object that allowed him to imprint his bloodline power into it.<br>Here, Chu Feng had the option of choosing to channel the Four Symbols Divine Power or his Heavenly Bloodline in. After some consideration, Chu Feng eventually decided to channel both into the object together.<br>And just as Chu Feng was in the midst of doing so, the old man looked at Chu Feng and shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Brat, what are you in such a rush for? I haven&rsquo;t even finished my words yet. I should have you know that my bloodline power is still considerably powerful. If you fail to withstand the pressure from my bloodline power, you might very well lose your mind and explode from its sheer power,&rdquo; the old man said.<br>It was just that Chu Feng could no longer hear his words anymore.<br>&ldquo;Forget it! Let me take a peek into your talents then!&rdquo;<br>As he said those words, the old man began to channel his bloodline power into the object too.<br>Initially, Chu Feng was unable to sense anything special from the object. Nothing peculiar happened even after he channeled his bloodline power into the object.<br>But all of sudden, he felt a terrifying power wrapping around him. A crease formed on his forehead, and his heartbeat hastened.<br>It was a powerful pressure that made it difficult for Chu Feng to even breathe.<br>&ldquo;Is that the elder&rsquo;s bloodline power?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
