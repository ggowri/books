        <div>: Chu Feng&rsquo;s Decision<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Why do you have such an expression on your face?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you really are&hellip; Haa, you shouldn&rsquo;t just pick it just because it&rsquo;s a rank eight Exalted Taboo! There&rsquo;s no use picking a rank eight Exalted Taboo if you can&rsquo;t grasp it. You might as well pick a rank seven Exalted Taboo that would be useful to you instead,&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian said.<br>&ldquo;What makes you think that I won&rsquo;t be able to practice this rank eight Exalted Taboo? I&rsquo;ve already said that it&rsquo;s suited for me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking nonsense. There&rsquo;s not a single person who has managed to fully grasp Hellfire Quick Draw. Even our Holy Monarch was only able to grasp the basics of it when he tried to learn it back then.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m not saying this because I'm worried about our Holy Valley&rsquo;s Exalted Taboo being leaked out. To be honest with you, this martial skill doesn&rsquo;t even come from us. I just don&rsquo;t want you to waste this precious opportunity.<br>&ldquo;Forget it, there&rsquo;s no point talking about all this now. You&rsquo;ve already made your choice anyway,&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian said helplessly.<br>&ldquo;You seem to know quite a bit about this martial skill. You have learned it before?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never learned it before, but I know about it. Isn&rsquo;t this the martial skill created by the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor?&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian said.<br>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.<br>That was precisely the reason why he thought that the Exalted Taboo was suited for him. He was the successor of the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor, and that led him to think that the Holy Light Martial Skill Compendium had specially picked out the manual for him.<br>&ldquo;It looks like you&rsquo;re really fond of that Exalted Taboo,&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian said helplessly when she saw the excited look on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>She knew that Chu Feng had his eyes set on the martial skill.<br>&ldquo;I know how tempting that Exalted Taboo is, but it&rsquo;s extremely difficult to master. Never mind, it&rsquo;s already too late for regrets now. You can give it a try, but don&rsquo;t force yourself too much. You might suffer a cultivation deviation if you get too obsessed with it.<br>&ldquo;There are many ancestors of our Holy Valley who sustained severe injuries after practicing this martial skill. Even the closed-door disciple of our Holy Monarch, Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an, gave up on it after giving it a try,&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian said.<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an? Could the Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an you spoke of refer to this person?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng began drawing out a portrait using his spirit power. That was the Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an he had met previously at Conquerstar Mountain Villa.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him. You know him?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xintian was surprised to find out that Chu Feng knew of Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met him before. He&rsquo;s the Holy Monarch&rsquo;s closed-door disciple?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was surprised too.<br>He had a good impression of Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an. He was a refined person who didn&rsquo;t hesitate to help others. He showed none of the arrogance that a young master from a powerful clan would usually show.<br>Yet, who could have thought that Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an would actually be a member of the Holy Valley and the esteemed disciple of the Holy Monarch?<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was acquainted with Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an, Shengguang Xintian ignored Chu Feng&rsquo;s question and enquired about something else first, &ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, how is your relationship with Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t close, but I have a good impression of him,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;I see. Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an is the only closed-door disciple of our Holy Monarch. He&rsquo;s outstanding in all aspects, boasting the greatest talent amongst us juniors. Even big sister Menglai isn&rsquo;t a match for him.<br>&ldquo;Strictly speaking, he isn&rsquo;t a member of our Holy Valley. He only obtained the Holy Light Bloodline through a series of coincidences. He has no kin and grew up in our Holy Valley, so it isn&rsquo;t too far-fetched to say that he&rsquo;s one of us.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that many in the Holy Valley think of him as an outsider and aren&rsquo;t very fond of him. I&rsquo;m one of the few who are on close terms with him,&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian said.<br>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng nodded comprehendingly.<br>When he heard that Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an wasn&rsquo;t liked by others and was viewed as an outsider, he couldn&rsquo;t help but think about himself. He was also oppressed by the other members of the Chu clan back then because they viewed him as an outsider.<br>It didn&rsquo;t feel good to be in such a position.<br>Weng!<br>The surroundings suddenly began trembling, causing the bookshelf in front of them to shake intensely.<br>&ldquo;Ahh! I got too engrossed with talking to you that I nearly forgot our purpose here. There&rsquo;s a limit to the time you can remain in the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium, so you need to quickly pick the other two manuals,&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ve already made up my mind.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng floated toward two of the rank seven Exalted Taboo Martial Skills placed on the bookshelf.<br>Even as he was chatting with Shengguang Xintian, his eyes had been scanning the manuals on the bookshelf. By now, he had already looked through all of the manuals and decided on what he wanted to take.<br>Shengguang Xintian walked over to look at those two books. They were the Storm Dragon Footwork and Storm Dragon Obliteration.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re interested in these two manuals?&rdquo;<br>Her voice sounded like she was hoping for Chu Feng to deny it.<br>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve already made up my mind.&rdquo;<br>It was just that Chu Feng answered her question affirmatively. He even reached out to grab those two manuals.<br>This time around, before he could come into contact with the manuals, Shengguang Xintian suddenly grasped his wrist to stop him.<br>&ldquo;My gosh, are you a masochist? Look at the kind of martial skills you&rsquo;re picking!&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian exclaimed in bewilderment.<br>&ldquo;Is there something wrong with the martial skills I picked? If I&rsquo;m not wrong, these two martial skills are created by the same person, so they should be related to each other. Cultivating two martial skills that synergize well with each other can usually bring about unexpected gains,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right to say that the two martial skills are created by the same person and are related to each other. It&rsquo;s just that you&rsquo;ll be disappointed if you&rsquo;re hoping for unexpected gains. These two martial skills are known to be incredibly weak,&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ll judge it myself,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He determinedly placed his hands on those two martial skills and took in their information.<br>Storm Dragon Footwork was a rank seven Exalted Taboo Martial Skill. Practitioners of this Exalted Taboo would produce a thunderous roar with every step taken. It was much weaker than other rank seven Exalted Taboos, but that was because it was just a simple movement skill. Its true prowess would only be shown when used together with Storm Dragon Obliteration.<br>Storm Dragon Obliteration was a rank seven Exalted Taboo Martial Skill. Practitioners of this Exalted Taboo would produce a dragon&rsquo;s roar when channeling their martial energy into their dantian. It was an offensive martial skill that would be greatly enhanced when used together with the Storm Dragon Footwork.<br>These two Exalted Taboos were created by the same person who went by the name of &lsquo;Storm&rsquo;.<br>&ldquo;Why are you smiling? You can&rsquo;t really be thinking of learning these two martial skills, are you?&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian asked in horror upon seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s satisfied smile.<br>&ldquo;I think they look pretty decent,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Wait wait wait! You really shouldn&rsquo;t choose these two martial skills. They are definitely the weakest ones amongst the other rank seven Exalted Taboo Martial Skills available for selection. There are a few cultivators who didn&rsquo;t believe in it and tried to learn them&hellip; including me. However, it turned out to be an utter waste of time.<br>&ldquo;Even when those two martial skills are used simultaneously, all it does is to produce a thunderous rumbling when moving around. You&rsquo;ll just look like a fool.<br>&ldquo;If you trust me, you should pick this Flaming Beast Slash instead. It boasts tremendous destructive prowess. It&rsquo;s not easy to learn it, but I believe that you&rsquo;ll definitely be able to pull it off,&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian said as she pointed to another rank seven Exalted Taboo on the bookshelf.<br>However, Chu Feng picked up the Storm Dragon Footwork and Storm Dragon Obliteration manuals and absorbed them into his mind. He chose to persist in his choices.<br></p></div>
