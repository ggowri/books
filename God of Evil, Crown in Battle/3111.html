        <h1>Chapter 3110</h1>
        <div> - The Appearance Of The Exceptional Genius<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That old man was called Wuming Xiuyi. He was extremely powerful. He could be said to be the strongest individual amongst everyone present. [1. Wuming = nameless.]<br>This old man also enjoyed an extraordinary status in the Starfield Master Realm.<br>That said, even an expert like him still addressed Exalted Heavenly Fate as &lsquo;lord.&rsquo; That was because Exalted Heavenly Fate was extremely important to the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Even after Wuming Xiuyi spoke, Exalted Heavenly Fate still did not provide a direct answer. Instead, he pointed his finger eastward.<br>&ldquo;A conclusion has been obtained from this prophecy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the near future, an exceptional genius will appear out of our Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s eastern region,&rdquo; Exalted Heavenly Fate said as he pointed to the planetary stars in the east.<br>&ldquo;Exceptional genius? Another exceptional genius is going to be born? This is great, it is truly a great thing for our Ancestral Martial Starfield!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the many grand characters present all revealed joyous expressions. After all, the appearance of a genius was not a bad thing. In fact, to them, geniuses were capable of strengthening their Ancestral Martial Starfield, something beneficial to their Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>However, at the moment when the crowd were all joyous and even laughing, the people from the Starfield Master Realm were completely expressionless.<br>At that moment, the crowd came to a sudden realization.<br>The Starfield Master Realm was located in the center of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. The appearance of a genius in the eastern region of the Ancestral Martial Starfield should naturally be unrelated to the Starfield Master Realm.<br>To the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the birth of an exceptional genius was a good thing. However, to the Starfield Master Realm, it might not necessarily be a good thing.<br>Because of that, the crowd immediately stopped their laughter.<br>No one continued to mention the matter. They were afraid of angering the people from the Starfield Master Realm.<br>&ldquo;Lord Heavenly Fate, which Upper Realm will that genius emerge from? What sort of accomplishments will he or she obtain in the future? Was there any mention of that information in the prophecy?&rdquo; The Starfield Master Realm&rsquo;s Wuming Xiuyi asked.<br>&ldquo;I do not know exactly which Upper Realm that person will emerge from. Right now, that child is still not grown. However, he will soon reveal his outstanding talent. Furthermore, his growth will be lightning fast. Not long from now, his strength will catch up to that of Linghu Hongfei,&rdquo; Exalted Heavenly Fate said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually a genius of the same caliber as Linghu Hongfei?!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, many people revealed astonished expressions.<br>If it were only an exceptional genius, it would be one thing. However, if that person was an exceptional genius on par with Linghu Hongfei, that would truly be world-shocking news.<br>Who was Linghu Hongfei?<br>Linghu Hongfei was a clansman of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>The Linghu Heavenly Clan was the strongest of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s Ten Great Heavenly Clans.<br>Disregarding his background, Linghu Hongfei himself was an extremely astonishing individual.<br>Linghu Hongfei was the strongest of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, the current strongest person of the younger generation in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Furthermore, his strength was much superior to that of the second strongest individual among the Ancestral Martial Decastars.<br>It would not be excessive to say the second strongest among the Ancestral Martial Decastars was light-years apart from him.<br>As for Linghu Hongfei, he was only forty-three years old.<br>Even though he was clearly the strongest, he was the youngest of the Ancestral Martial Decastars.<br>Because of that, Linghu Hongfei was wholly accepted as the strongest genius in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Over the years, Linghu Hongfei began to make achievement after achievement. Each and every one of his achievements was astonishing.<br>In fact, there were many people in the Ancestral Martial Starfield that felt that Linghu Hongfei would end up surpassing Chu Xuanyuan from back then, and bring their Ancestral Martial Starfield to a completely new height.<br>And at that moment, one such genius on par with Linghu Hongfei had actually appeared in the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s eastern region. With this, how could the people not be astonished?<br>Whilst the others were astonished upon hearing this news, the expressions of the people from the Starfield Master Realm turned even uglier.<br>A single Linghu Hongfei was already a headache to them. If another genius of Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s caliber were to appear, it would make their headache even worse.<br>Right at that moment, Exalted Heavenly Fate spoke again, &ldquo;This old man also prophesies that the exceptional genius that will emerge from the eastern region of the starfield is destined to fight against Linghu Hongfei. Only one of them will live.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The two exceptional geniuses will fight, and only one will live?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the astonishment on the crowd&rsquo;s faces grew even stronger.<br>Only one of the two exceptional geniuses would live. To the Ancestral Martial Starfield, it was most definitely something sad.<br>As people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, they all did not wish for such a thing to happen.<br>That said, when compared to the others from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the expressions of the people from the Starfield Master Realm, the ruler of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, had taken a turn for the better.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Heavenly Fate, for your troubles,&rdquo; Wuming Xiuyi clasped his fist respectfully.<br>After him, the others also clasped their fists respectfully at Exalted Heavenly Fate to bid their farewells. Exalted Heavenly Fate also returned their gesture to them.<br>After the crowd bid their farewells, they all began to descend. There was an enormous formation below the Heavenly Fate Stage. There were many entrances to the enormous formation. Each entrance connected to a different world. The crowd all left through the enormous formation.<br>In the blink of an eye, the sky that was filled with powerful experts earlier only had two people remaining.<br>One was Exalted Heavenly Fate, who stood on the Heavenly Fate Stage.<br>As for the other, it was a middle-aged woman standing below the Heavenly Fate Stage.<br>That woman had a very ordinary appearance. She had a birthmark that covered half of her face. It caused the woman to appear very ugly, and even slightly frightening.<br>Strangely, the woman&rsquo;s aura was exceptionally good. Even though her appearance was ugly, the aura she emitted not only caused others to not feel antipathy toward her, but others would instead have a good impression of her.<br>That woman was Exalted Heavenly Fate&rsquo;s subordinate. She was known as Aunt Blackface.<br>After the crowd left, Aunt Blackface flew up to the Heavenly Fate Stage and stood behind Exalted Heavenly Fate.<br>&ldquo;Actually, I did not mention all of the prophecy this time,&rdquo; Exalted Heavenly Fate said.<br>&ldquo;Milord, what might you have concealed?&rdquo; Aunt Blackface asked.<br>&ldquo;This old man had prophesied which Upper Realm that exceptional genius will emerge from. I&rsquo;ve even become aware of which clan he will emerge from,&rdquo; Exalted Heavenly Fate said.<br>&ldquo;Milord, might you be willing to inform me of it?&rdquo; Aunt Blackface asked.<br>&ldquo;There is naturally no need for me to hide it from you,&rdquo; Exalted Heavenly Fate looked to Aunt Blackface. Trust filled his eyes.<br>He said, &ldquo;That child is from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually the Chu Heavenly Clan?!&rdquo; Aunt Blackface&rsquo;s expression changed upon hearing those words. Then, she smiled and said, &ldquo;It would appear that the Chu Heavenly Clan will be able to emerge in power once again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the battle that I&rsquo;ve prophesied is also real. Thus, to the Chu Heavenly Clan, that might not necessarily be a good thing,&rdquo; Exalted Heavenly Fate sighed. Then, he asked, &ldquo;Have you returned with news of Sacred Tiger and Sacred Deer?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, Milord and Milady have been discovered,&rdquo; Aunt Blackface said.<br>&ldquo;Discovered?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Exalted Heavenly Fate revealed a cheerful look.<br>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; Aunt Blackface hesitated.<br>&ldquo;But? What happened?&rdquo; Exalted Heavenly Fate asked.<br>&ldquo;The two Exalted have gone insane,&rdquo; Aunt Blackface said.<br>&ldquo;Insane?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, deep shock emerged in Exalted Heavenly Fate&rsquo;s deep eyes.<br></p></div>
