        <h1>Chapter 5574: Chaotic Era Scholar</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;The passage of time sure is heartless. You don&rsquo;t even recognize your own master?&rdquo; the silhouette asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Master? I have no master. Who are you?&rdquo; The evil power remained terrified, but there was a tinge of doubt in its voice too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him?&rdquo; Chu Feng immediately recognized the silhouette as soon as he heard the voice.</span><br><span>This was the person who reminded him that Long Chengyu and the others would be in danger when he entered the treacherous assimilation formation together with the Totem Dragon Clan, Totem Phoenix Clan, and the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan. That person gave him a compass, giving him a chance to raise his cultivation and overcome the assimilation formation.</span><br><span>Chu Feng never could have imagined that that person was hiding in his body, and he didn&rsquo;t notice a thing at all!</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who am I? You really don&rsquo;t remember me?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The light shrouding the silhouette faded, revealing a man of an ordinary appearance. He wore a spotlessly clean white robe, but it was not made out of extravagant silk or treasures but ordinary cloth. However, he carried a sword behind him that made Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes light up.</span><br><span>The sword had an ordinary, silver hilt, and its blade was concealed by a leather sheath. Nevertheless, Chu Feng could tell that it was no ordinary weapon, as he could feel that the leather sheath contained the aura of a conqueror. It appeared to be from the same lineage as the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s bloodline, just much stronger.</span><br><span>It was a sword sheath made out of real </span><span>dragonskin</span><span>!</span><br><span>Furthermore, the insides of the sheath contained random patterns that were actually runes harnessing incredible sealing power. It went without saying that it was to seal that sword. Just how powerful must the sword be that it needed to be sealed by such a powerful sheath?</span><br><span>The owner of such a formidable treasure was bound to be an incredible person too.</span><br><span>While Chu Feng was assessing the white-robed man, Little Fishy, Jie Tian, and the evil power were doing the same too. Other than fear, confusion was reflected in the blood-red eyes of the evil power.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It looks like you have lost your memories due to that incident. It matters not. I&rsquo;ll </span><span>restore your memories.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The white-robed man waved his sleeves, and a painting flew above the head of the evil power before unfurling. A powerful formation then descended from the painting and enveloped the evil power.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him?&rdquo; Chu Feng could deduce who the white-robed man was based on the painting formation and the aura it was emanating.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, is that the master of the All Lives Are Equal Palace, Chaotic Era Scholar?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s him. He&rsquo;s still alive&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured.</span><br><span>Back then, when Chu Feng was in the All Lives Are Equal Palace, the World Spiritist Painter had asked him to look at a painting. In the painting, Chu Feng saw a coffin encasing a powerful individual. As that powerful individual had an aura similar to the All Lives Are Equal Palace, he deduced that person was Chaotic Era Scholar.</span><br><span>Considering that the white-robed man had manifested a formation from a painting, and his aura was similar to the powerful individual Chu Feng had encountered inside the coffin back then, there was little doubt that he was Chaotic Era Scholar.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How did he slip into your body? Was it during your time in the All Lives Are Equal Palace?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not then,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Eggy was perplexed.</span><br><span>Gah!</span><br><span>Before Chu Feng could answer that question, the evil power suddenly let out a piercing howl. Its face warped in pain as a surge of energy resonated in its mind.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You snuck into this realm and spent many years trying to assimilate into it so as to avoid getting sealed off, but do you remember who helped you sneak into here? Do you remember who was the one who ordered you to steal the secrets of the Immemorial Star Sea?&rdquo; the white-robed man&rsquo;s voice echoed throughout the entire realm.</span><br><span>His voice contained spirit power.</span><br><span>The evil power&rsquo;s demeanor immediately changed. It kneeled on the floor and cried out, &ldquo;Milord! Lord Chaotic Era Scholar!&rdquo;</span><br><span>It showed no hints of subservience earlier despite having realized how powerful the white-robed man was, but as soon as it learned of his identity, it immediately got to its knees and paid respect to him. This showed that the white-robed man was truly the evil power&rsquo;s master.</span><br><span>Those words also verified Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess that the white-robed man was Chaotic Era Scholar.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Chaotic Era Scholar?&rdquo; Jie Tian was taken aback.</span><br><span>He had also heard about Chaotic Era Scholar. It wasn&rsquo;t surprising since Jie Tian was from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, which had information about many ancient remnants.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re finally here!&rdquo; the evil power cried.</span><br><span>It wasn&rsquo;t out of fear but yearning. It must have been on close terms with Chaotic Era Scholar, or else it wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten so emotional.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why are you crying? What a disgrace,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar scoffed at the evil power before turning to Chu Feng. &ldquo;Is there anything you would like to ask?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, was our first meeting at the All Lives Are Equal Palace?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, I was inside the coffin,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar replied with a nod.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is the Demon Crane your treasure too?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>He had been wondering how Chaotic Era Scholar had gotten into his body. The only answer he could think of was the Demon Crane. They had undergone tempering inside the Demon Crane, and Chu Feng even took in a tremendous amount of black aura. Yet, he received no benefits in the end.</span><br><span>He was previously confused why that was the case, but he could tell now that the Demon Crane was searching for a suitable individual to house Chaotic Era Scholar.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. The Demon Crane is a means I have specially prepared to fuse myself into you so as to avoid detection,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Avoid detection? Are you referring to the Immemorial Star Sea&rsquo;s formation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>There weren&rsquo;t many people or things that could threaten a person of Chaotic Era Scholar&rsquo;s strength. The only thing Chu Feng could think of was the Immemorial Star Sea&rsquo;s formation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar nodded.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, were you the one who paved the road into the Immemorial Star Sea?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;You were also the one who turned me into a formation entity. The reason behind that is to avoid the detection of the formation here.&rdquo;</span><br><span>A smile formed on the Chaotic Era Scholar&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You hit the nail on the head.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, you have put such elaborate plans into motion with the goal of entering the Star Sea Realm. I&rsquo;m guessing you are after the secret of the Star Memorial Domain?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar nodded.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, are you confident now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar replied.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was taken aback.</span><br><span>Despite having overcome the Star Sea Realm&rsquo;s sealing power earlier, Chaotic Era Scholar still wasn&rsquo;t confident of reaching the Star Memorial Domain&rsquo;s secret. Did this mean that the power of the Immemorial Star Sea was even greater than Chaotic Era Scholar&rsquo;s?</span><br><span>&ldquo;Now that you have asked so many questions, it&rsquo;s time for me to pose mine,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, please feel free,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Those who know about my secret aren&rsquo;t permitted to live. Do you think I&rsquo;ll allow you to live?&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar asked with a smile, but his smile sent shivers down Chu Feng&rsquo;s spine.</span></p></div>
