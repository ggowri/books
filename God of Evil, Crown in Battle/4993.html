        <h1>Chapter 4992</h1>
        <div>: With Lives on the Line<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Daoist Niantian? What are you doing here?&rdquo;<br>The Godwish Grandmother and<br>blurted out. It was clear from their expressions that they were acquaintances with Daoist Niantian.<br>&ldquo;We came here together with Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Those words informed the two women of his stance. Both the Godwish Grandmother and<br>immediately revealed a strong hostility toward them.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Niantian&rsquo;s means are as formidable as ever. It&rsquo;s no wonder why I couldn&rsquo;t sense a thing at all till you made your appearance. Niantian, since you have been here all along, you should be able to tell that we&rsquo;re on close terms with young friend Chu Feng. We harbor no hostility toward him, and we wish to keep it that way.<br>&ldquo;Given so, may I ask you not to interfere in this matter?&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother asked.<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re on close terms with young friend Chu Feng, shouldn&rsquo;t you have a good idea what kind of person he is? There&rsquo;s no way you would be able to remain on close terms with him after hurting Miss Zi Ling. If young friend Chu Feng ever learns of this, he&rsquo;ll definitely take your lives!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei bellowed.<br>He released his rank eight Martial Exalted level oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;Who do you think you are to butt in on our conversation?&rdquo;<br>However, the Godwish Grandmother sneered coldly in the face of Shengguang Baimei&rsquo;s intimidation. It looked like she didn&rsquo;t think that he was a threat at all.<br>&ldquo;Cut the crap. Anyone who dares to show disrespect to young hero Chu Feng deserves to die!&rdquo;<br>With a furious bellow, Shengguang Baimei activated his bloodline power, causing his cultivation to rise to rank nine Martial Exalted level.<br>He was confident in his own strength, but he wasn&rsquo;t so conceited as to let his guard down against famous experts like the Godwish Grandmother and<br>. He knew that he should have remained hidden, but he was too angry that he couldn&rsquo;t just turn a blind eye to it.<br>He had no intention to make peace with the two of them at all.<br>As soon as he raised his cultivation, he charged at the Godwish Grandmother and<br>, wanting to teach the two of them a lesson.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng and Zi Ling were still playing with Yaoyao, unaware that a battle had occurred.<br>The Godwish Grandmother and<br>had set up a formation to seal off the vicinity, such that it was impossible to hear anything no matter how intense the fight was.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, hurry up and escape with Zi Ling!&rdquo; a voice transmission was suddenly delivered into Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>It was from Song Xue&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask about useless stuff and leave right now!&rdquo;<br>Song Xue&rsquo;er chose not to respond to Chu Feng anymore after saying her piece. From her urgent tone, Chu Feng could tell that something huge must have happened. So, he pushed the door open and glanced in the direction where the Godwish Grandmother and<br>were.<br>The formation they had set up isolated voices and blocked off any oppressive might from leaking out, but its transparency still allowed those outside to see what was going on.<br>Chu Feng could see Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian inside the barrier, held firmly in place. Daoist Niantian was only kept captive, but Shengguang Baimei was lying on the ground with a bloodied hole in his chest. Blood was spurting out from his mouth, indicating that he was severely injured.<br>&ldquo;Zi Ling, hurry up and leave.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng urged Zi Ling to leave upon sensing that something was amiss. However, the Godwish Grandmother sensed Chu Feng and presence and turned her sights over.<br>Boom!<br>Overwhelming oppressive might poured out from the formation, sealing off the surroundings.<br>The Godwish Grandmother was actually at rank nine Martial Exalted level! On top of that, she had the power to raise her cultivation by an additional rank.<br>It was no wonder why the Godwish Grandmother dared to enlist the help of those from the Totem Galaxy, It turned out that she was confident of suppressing them.<br>&ldquo;Elder, what do you mean by this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, hurry up and take Miss Zi Ling away with you. They&rsquo;re intending to take away Zi Ling&rsquo;s soul power so as to give it to Song Yun!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei shouted with a feeble voice.<br>Upon hearing those words, Chu Feng turned to the Godwish Grandmother.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right. Yun&rsquo;er needs the soul power inside Miss Zi Ling in order to survive. Young friend Chu Feng, we can be considered as old acquaintances now. I&rsquo;ve helped you once, so strictly speaking, you do owe me a favor. Why don&rsquo;t you repay the favor today?&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother said.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t listen to her words. Take Miss Zi Ling away right now! They&rsquo;re planning to forcefully draw out the soul power inside Miss Zi Ling&rsquo;s body. That&rsquo;ll inflict grievous harm onto her!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>While the Godwish Grandmother was far more powerful than they had expected, he knew that Chu Feng did possess special means that would allow him to escape from this situation.<br>&ldquo;You sure are full of nonsense.&rdquo;<br>The Godwish Grandmother clenched her fist, and a huge pit formed where Shengguang Baimei was. He was forcefully crushed into the bottom of the pit.<br>Chu Feng could sense that Shengguang Baimei was still alive, but he had gotten even more injured that it was no longer possible for him to talk anymore.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, this man was arrogant to attempt to take my life. If not for my strength, I might have already lost my life to him. I could have taken his life easily, but it&rsquo;s on your account that I chose to spare him. I&rsquo;m aware that he&rsquo;s with you,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother said.<br>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Song Yun? Tell her to come out and meet me.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could tell that the Godwish Grandmother had already made up her mind, so he decided not to waste his breath with useless words. Instead, he started calling out for Song Yun.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; Song Yun replied from the rooftop of a nearby palace. &ldquo;You need not ask any further. It&rsquo;s my intention as well. I hope that you can fulfill my wish.&rdquo;<br>Song Yun didn&rsquo;t bother beating around the bush, choosing to get straight to the point.<br>Chu Feng then turned his eyes toward<br>and asked, &ldquo;Elder, is this your intention too?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, my older sister doesn't intend to harm Miss Zi Ling. It&rsquo;s just that Yun&rsquo;er is critically ill and requires the complete soul of the Monstrous King in order to recover,&rdquo;<br>replied.<br>&ldquo;You need not tell me that. I&rsquo;ll only ask you one question. When I saved Lele back then, you said that you owe me a debt of gratitude and that you would help me if I ever ask for it. Right now, I want you to convincethe Godwish Grandmother to let me, Zi Ling, Elder Baimei, and Elder Niantian go,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, that&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Lady of Dao Sea<br>was put in a spot.<br>&ldquo;Say no more. I understand. The adage rings true. Only in times of crisis will you see a person&rsquo;s true heart,&rdquo; Chu Feng scoffed before sighing lamentably.<br>Then, he looked at the Godwish Grandmother with icy-cold eyes.<br>&ldquo;Elder, are you determined to take the soul power inside Zi Ling&rsquo;s body?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I promise you that I won&rsquo;t hurt Miss Zi Ling as far as possible. I&rsquo;ll also try my best to look for other sources of soul power to treat Miss Zi Ling&rsquo;s illness,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother said.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>However, Chu Feng only replied with a scoff. When he finally raised his head once more, resolve could be seen in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, don&rsquo;t blame me for getting nasty.&rdquo;<br>The Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Four Symbols Divine Power appeared simultaneously. At the same time, the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword also manifested in his hand.<br>He was prepared to fight for the hope of breaking free. As powerful as the Godwish Grandmother was, he still had to give it a try.<br>Pah!<br>But just as Chu Feng was about to go all out, someone suddenly grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s wrist and pressed his hand down. Following that, a voice sounded.<br>&ldquo;I can see the feelings you carry for Zi Ling are true, but it&rsquo;s not time for you to put your life on the line yet.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
