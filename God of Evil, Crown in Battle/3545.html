        <h1>Chapter 3544</h1>
        <div> - Starfall Eight Immortals<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Little brat, you&rsquo;re powerless to even protect yourself, yet you dare to threaten me?&rdquo; The undead man looked to Wang Qiang like he was a joke.<br>&ldquo;If y-you d-dare to d-do anything to my bro-brother, your d-daddy I will commit s-suicide,&rdquo; Wang Qiang spoke with a determined expression.<br>Seeing how serious Wang Qiang was, the undead man actually started to panic slightly. Rarely had he ever seen Wang Qiang acting so seriously. He did not seem to be joking around at all.<br>The undead man laughed mischievously, &ldquo;Okay, okay, okay. I&rsquo;m merely joking around. After he resurrects me, I will release them.&rdquo;<br>However, even after hearing those words from the undead man, Wang Qiang&rsquo;s eyes were still filled with suspicion. He could be said to have been living with that old monster for quite some time now. Thus, he knew very well how cunning the old thing was.<br>Then, Wang Qiang turned his eyes to the lake.<br>After seeing that Chu Feng was rapidly moving, Wang Qiang&rsquo;s tensed expression eased up a lot.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>&hellip;...<br>Chu Feng had no idea that his every action was currently being seen by Wang Qiang.<br>He was currently traveling at a high speed. He didn&rsquo;t know where he should go. But, he wanted to know exactly what had happened in the Void Sacred Tree. Naturally, he was most worried about Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;This aura&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng came to a stop, and turned his gaze southeastward.<br>At the direction Chu Feng was looking at, eight figures were rapidly moving toward his location.<br>They were eight old men. They were all wearing white gowns and giving off an extraordinary air like celestial immortals. Most shockingly, those eight white-gowned old men all looked identical.<br>They were like eight clones of a single person.<br>Those eight individuals were all Martial Immortals.<br>Although they had identical looks, their aura were not the same.<br>The strongest amongst them was only a rank five Martial Immortal, whereas the weakest was a rank one Martial Immortal.<br>Because there was quite a difference in their cultivations, the reason why the eight of them were able to travel with identical speed was because they were all being carried forward by that rank five Martial Immortal old man.<br>&ldquo;It really is them.&rdquo;<br>In the beginning, Chu Feng only felt their auras. However, as the eight old men approached, Chu Feng was able to see their appearances.<br>Upon seeing them, Chu Feng immediately revealed a joyous look. The reason for that was because they were people that Chu Feng knew.<br>Although the Chu Heavenly Clan was the publicly accepted overlord of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, other powers were also able to take root there.<br>Among them, the publicly accepted strongest power beneath the Chu Heavenly Clan was the Starfall Holy Land.<br>Back when Chu Feng had first arrived in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, he had yet to be recognized by the Chu Heavenly Clan. At that time, he was journeying throughout the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm all on his own, and ended up having quite a few disputes with people from the Starfall Holy Land.<br>He made enemies of many individuals. One such example would be the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Son, Song Yunfei.<br>Of course, Chu Feng also befriended some people. For example, there was the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter, Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>The Starfall Eight Immortals were also people that he had befriended.<br>The eight people that had appeared before Chu Feng were precisely the Starfall Eight Immortals.<br>Although Chu Feng had actually not been in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm for a long time, it had been some time since he had last met them.<br>Most importantly, Chu Feng had experienced a lot of things in this short period of time. Thus, even though it had not been a long time since they had last met, it still felt like years.<br>To meet old friends was something that brought forth joy to begin with. This held even more true for old friends that held special meaning in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart.<br>Chu Feng planned to fly toward the eight of them to greet them.<br>&ldquo;Trash, stop struggling, you won't be able to escape!&rdquo;<br>To Chu Feng&rsquo;s surprise, several cold and sinister-sounding voices sounded from behind the Starfall Eight Immortals. Then, thirteen black-cloaked figures appeared and surrounded them.<br>Covered in black cloaks, one simply could not see the appearance of those thirteen individuals.<br>However, their auras caused the Starfall Eight Immortals to frown.<br>Those thirteen individuals were all Martial Immortals. Furthermore, all of them possessed cultivations that surpassed those of the Starfall Eight Immortals.<br>&ldquo;Who might you all be? Why do you pursue us like this? Why are you so unwilling to let us go?&rdquo; Elder Xing Yi asked with his fist clasped.<br>&ldquo;Trash like you are unqualified to know who we are. Obediently submit yourselves to us. Otherwise&hellip; don't blame us for becoming impolite,&rdquo; said a black-cloaked individual.<br>As that person spoke, he made a grabbing motion with his palm, and martial power immediately gathered, forming a rope in his hand.<br>It was not only him. The other black-cloaked individuals present also formed ropes with their martial power.<br>There were precisely eight ropes. They were planning to tie up the Starfall Eight Immortals.<br>Witnessing that scene, the Starfall Eight Immortals knew that the situation was bad. Those people clearly held ill-intentions towards them.<br>Most depressing of all, those people had cultivations above their own. Even if they wanted to resist, they would not be able to.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, a burst of oppressive might appeared out of thin air. Then, like dying dogs, all thirteen black-cloaked individuals crashed onto their stomachs.<br>Their appearances were extremely sorry.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! There&rsquo;s a helper?!&rdquo; a black-cloaked individual cried angrile. Following that, crimson radiance started to emit from the thirteen black-cloaked individuals&rsquo; black cloaks.<br>&ldquo;Bang, bang, bang~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, all thirteen black-cloaked individuals exploded.<br>At the instant the thirteen black-cloaked individuals exploded, powerful energy ripples swept forth.<br>The Starfall EIght Immortals felt that they were doomed. After all, the energy ripples caused by the detonations of the black-cloaked individuals were extremely powerful.<br>If the energy ripples engulfed them, they would all definitely die.<br>However, to their surprise, before the powerful energy ripples could approach them, they disappeared.<br>It was that oppressive might. That oppressive might had forcibly eliminated the power caused by the self-detonation of the black-cloaked individuals.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, benefactor, for helping us.&rdquo;<br>The Starfall Eight Immortals stood in a circle, clasped their fists and bowed to eight different directions at the same time.<br>The reason why they were acting like this was because they knew that an expert had saved them. However, they did not know which direction that expert was in.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, I am no expert.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice sounded from the trees above.<br>Looking up, the Starfall Eight Immortals all revealed joyous looks. This was especially true for Elder Xing Yi, who started grinning from ear to ear.<br>The reason for their reaction was because they saw a young man sitting on a thick tree branch above them. As for that young man, he was someone that they all recognized. He was none other than Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng pays his respects to seniors Eight Immortals,&rdquo; Chu Feng leaped down from the giant tree branch, clasped his fist and bowed to the Starfall Eight Immortals.<br>&ldquo;You must not, you must not. You are currently the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s young master, how could you pay respects to us?&rdquo; Elder Xing Yi hurriedly stepped forward to help Chu Feng back up.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, you all will forever be this Chu Feng&rsquo;s seniors. As such, I will naturally have to greet you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words, the Starfall Eight Immortals smiled even more amiably.<br>They had thought highly of Chu Feng back then. And now, his actions proved to them that they had not misjudged his character.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re by yourself?&rdquo; Elder Xing Er asked Chu Feng after looking around.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I am alone,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;In that case, did you use a treasure earlier?&rdquo; Elder Xing Er asked.<br>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that oppressive might&hellip; was yours?&rdquo; Elder Xing Er&rsquo;s expression became somewhat strange as he asked that question.<br>It was not only him. The other seven of the Starfall Eight Immortals were also looking at Chu Feng with complicated gazes.<br>Faced with the focused eyes of the Starfall Eight Immortal, Chu Feng nodded and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, that oppressive might was mine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng said those words, the Starfall Eight Immortals who had complicated expressions on their faces immediately opened their mouths wide. Perhaps because they were too shocked, even their faces grew distorted.<br>They clearly felt that the oppressive might from earlier&hellip; seemed to have belonged to an Exalted!!!<br></p></div>
