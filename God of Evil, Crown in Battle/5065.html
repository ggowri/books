        <div>: Falling Into a Disadvantage<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What do I have to fear since I&rsquo;m already cornered? I just hope that you can hold to the end of your promise and release my master and the others if I win,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Of course, but do you really think that you stand a chance here?&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai said with a laugh.<br>His body began to glow brightly from the spirit power it was emanating. It was just pure spirit power, but it was enough to astonish all of the cultivators from the Nine Souls Galaxy. The might his spirit power commanded was comparable to a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator, meaning to say that he was at rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation!<br>Following that, the world suddenly tremored. Jiang Yuantai started releasing his martial power too, revealing his rank eight Martial Exalted level cultivation.<br>Holy flames started appearing on his body right after, raising his cultivation by a rank to rank nine Martial Exalted level. The flames morphed once more, and his aura raised even further. His strength had now far surpassed that of ordinary rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivators.<br>Jiang Yuantai was able to raise his cultivation by two ranks at rank eight Martial Exalted level, and he was a rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist too.<br>This was the caliber of a prodigy from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect!<br>While the cultivators of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan knew that the Eastern Region was probably hardly worth a mention compared to the powerhouse known as the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, they were still shocked by the prowess displayed by Jiang Yuantai.<br>It felt like they were standing before a rift that couldn&rsquo;t be bridged, and it filled their hearts with fear.<br>Sima Xiangtu breathed a sigh of relief after witnessing Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s prowess. He knew that Chu Feng was talented too, but he couldn&rsquo;t imagine any way Chu Feng could win this battle.<br>In fact, Chu Feng had a tight frown on his forehead.<br>If Jiang Yuantai was only at rank nine Martial Exalted level, he might still stand a chance with the Second Slash of his Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes. However, Jiang Yuantai was able to raise his cultivation by a rank above that of rank nine Martial Exalted level, which made him beyond Chu Feng&rsquo;s current means to deal with.<br>Chu Feng was the top prodigy of the Eastern Region, but he didn&rsquo;t stand a chance against Jiang Yuantai.<br>&ldquo;You need not panic. You would indeed stand no chance against me under normal circumstances, but I&rsquo;ll give you a chance today. Let&rsquo;s compete in another format,&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai said.<br>&ldquo;Another format?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your real cultivation level?&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai asked.<br>&ldquo;Rank four Martial Exalted level,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai sneered in disdain.<br>He glanced at Jiang Kongping, as if mocking the latter for being defeated by a mere rank four Martial Exalted level cultivator.<br>Jiang Kongping shrugged in response. He didn&rsquo;t say a word, but his movements were telling his older brother not to underestimate Chu Feng.<br>Jiang Yuantai thought nothing of his warning and turned his attention back to Chu Feng, saying, &ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll suppress his cultivation level down to rank four Martial Exalted level. We&rsquo;ll cross blows in the most primitive way, not using any martial skills, secret techniques, or means to raise cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You want to fight with me bare-handed?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it.&rdquo;<br>Jiang Yuantai reached into his Cosmos Sack and pulled out a wooden crate. The wooden crate flew into the sky and automatically opened itself, revealing eighteen different weapons within. These weapons were all made out of wood, not harnessing the slightest power in them. However, they were incredibly resilient.<br>They were actually treasures, just slightly peculiar ones.<br>Shoosh!<br>Jiang Yuantai raised his hand, and a wooden spear flew into his grasp.<br>&ldquo;Feel free to choose any of the weapons here,&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai said.<br>&ldquo;Are you sure you want to fight with me in such a manner? It&rsquo;ll be unfair for you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t. I can easily claim your life in a heartbeat in a normal fight, but I want to prove that you&rsquo;re inferior to me on all grounds. I want to show everyone from the Nine Souls Galaxy how helplessly weak their so-called strongest prodigy is!&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai said.<br>Chu Feng initially still had a fair impression of Jiang Yuantai since the latter&rsquo;s appearance had brought him a ray of hope, but those words made him realize that the latter was just plain arrogant. Jiang Yuantai simply had low self-esteem and wanted to validate his own self-worth here. It would be unwise to expect Jiang Yuantai to hold to the end of his promise.<br>Nevertheless, Chu Feng still wanted to give it a try here since this was his only hope.<br>Shoosh!<br>Chu Feng raised his hand, and a wooden sword flew into his grasp. He could tell right away that the wooden sword had no additional enhancements to it. Rather than a weapon, it would be more accurate to call it an artwork or a collectible.<br>That being said, its resilience was truly no joke. In that aspect, it was still possible to use it as a weapon.<br>&ldquo;Are you done choosing? You won&rsquo;t be able to swap your weapon once you have made your choice,&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take this,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;<br>With a flick of his sleeves, the wooden crate filled with weapons closed by itself and returned to Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s hand. By this point, Jiang Yuantai had already retracted his spirit power. His aura also started weakening till his cultivation was finally lowered to rank four Martial Exalted level.<br>&ldquo;Young master Yuantai.&rdquo;<br>Sima Xiangtu wanted to dissuade Jiang Yuantai from his decision.<br>Jiang Yuantai would have no problem defeating Chu Feng in a normal fight, but he was foolishly crippling himself for the sake of his needless pride. To get complacent against someone like Chu Feng was no different from courting death!<br>&ldquo;Shut your mouth! Say a word more and I&rsquo;ll terminate our partnership!&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai bellowed.<br>He pointed his spear toward Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll repeat it once more. No martial skills or secret techniques are allowed. You can&rsquo;t resort to any treasures either. We&rsquo;ll fight using the most primitive means till one of us admit defeat or lose the ability to continue fighting. If you break your promise, I&rsquo;ll immediately revert back to my original cultivation level and end your life,&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai said.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.<br>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai asked.<br>&ldquo;Come at me whenever you want to,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip; You&rsquo;re one confident lad. Let me see if your strength matches up to your words!&rdquo;<br>Shoosh!<br>Jiang Yuantai rushed toward Chu Feng with a spear in his hands, moving so quickly that he was able to reach Chu Feng within the blink of an eye.<br>Shoosh!<br>Jiang Yuantai propelled his spear toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart with a swift pierce that was both powerful and accurate. All experts present could tell that even though Jiang Yuantai had suppressed his cultivation, he was still one of the strongest ones among rank four Martial Exalted level cultivators.<br>Without resorting to martial skills, secret techniques, or treasures, no other rank four Martial Exalted level cultivator, be it a junior or an elder, would have been able to deal with that attack. That was simply how powerful Jiang Yuantai was!<br>Chu Feng dared not to get careless before Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s attack. He quickly took a step back and twisted his body to block that pierce. He chose to dodge instead of confronting Jiang Yuantai.<br>&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo;<br>Jiang Yuantai didn&rsquo;t lose his composure just because his spear had missed. Without any hesitation, he stopped the propulsion of his spear and swung it sideward instead, changing it into a sweeping motion.<br>Shoosh!<br>Given how close the two of them were and the large radius of the sweeping spear, it was impossible for Chu Feng to dodge the attack.<br>However, Chu Feng seemed to have predicted this follow-up attack from Jiang Yuantai. Just as the spear was about to strike Chu Feng, his sword suddenly moved in place to stop the spear.<br>Bam!<br>Both weapons were made out of wood, but their collision produced a resounding explosion, followed by furious shockwaves and diffused into the surroundings. Chu Feng was unable to hold his ground and ended up being sent flying.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?!&rdquo;<br>Wang Yuxian, the Lady of Dao Sea, the Godwish Grandmother, and the others were shocked to see that. They noticed that Chu Feng&rsquo;s arms were trembling ever so slightly the moment he was sent flying.<br>While Chu Feng had quickly stabilized his own arm right after, the experts present were still able to notice this subtle movement. It showed that Chu Feng, despite being unmatched in terms of strength amongst his peers all this while, was actually being overpowered!<br></p></div>
