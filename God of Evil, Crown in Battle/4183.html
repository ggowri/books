        <h1>Chapter 4182</h1>
        <div> - Lady Gusu<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Night time. The majority of people were resting.<br>Although martial cultivators no longer needed sleep and subsistence to survive after they reached a certain level of cultivation, resting would still restore their stamina, and was beneficial to cultivators.<br>Because of that, the great majority of cultivators would choose to rest at night. This was especially true for people with relatively weaker talent.<br>At that moment, there were two people in the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s camp that were not asleep.<br>Those two people possessed very strong talent.<br>They were the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Law Enforcement Elder Long Ruiyun and genius cultivator, Long Nanxun.<br>The two of them had their own respective sleeping chambers within their palaces to rest in.<br>Yet, they were currently resting inside the same sleeping chamber.<br>Furthermore, they were the only two people present.<br>&ldquo;Young master Nanxun, why are you so passionate about Princess Xiaoxiao?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t forget the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s current state of affairs,&rdquo; said Long Ruiyun.<br>&ldquo;I know. But, Xiaoxiao has helped me a lot.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t just disregard her after her mother lost power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead, I should be helping her at a time like this. Only at a time like this would I be able to win her heart,&rdquo; said Long Nanxun.<br>&ldquo;The struggles within the Dragon Clan are extremely cruel. At times, you need to learn to let go.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truth is, if it wasn&rsquo;t for Long Shengbu being willing to continue to protect Long Xiaoxiao, how could she have the nerve to act so mighty before us?&rdquo;<br>As Long Ruiyun said those words, she let out a cold snort.<br>Evidently, she held a grudge because of the way that Long Xiaoxiao had ordered them around today.<br>&ldquo;Grandma Ruiyun, please rest assured. I, Long Nanxun, am no fool.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though my affection for Xiaoxiao is real, I know propriety too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I have to choose between Xiaoxiao and my family&rsquo;s future prospects, I will choose my family&rsquo;s safety and my own future without any hesitation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, the state of affairs right now is still in doubt. Perhaps things will take a turn for the better.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, many people would have already distanced themselves from Long Xiaoxiao. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, this is the most optimal opportunity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, only I am still by her side. Only I am still willing to work for her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If things do turn for the better in the future, even if she doesn&rsquo;t return my love, she&rsquo;ll definitely remember my loyalty to her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll definitely put me in an important position under her,&rdquo; said Long Nanxun.<br>&ldquo;Mn. What you say is reasonable too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But regardless, you need to make sure to look out for yourself,&rdquo; said Long Ruiyun.<br>Suddenly, a voice was heard, &ldquo;What a great &lsquo;look out for yourself!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>It was a woman&rsquo;s voice. Furthermore, the voice was extremely mocking.<br>When the voice was heard, both Long Ruiyun and Long Nanxun had a huge change of expression.<br>Ignoring the fact that they&rsquo;d set up a spirit formation and that it should be impossible for others to enter, their earlier conversation had been extremely disrespectful.<br>If their conversation were known, especially if it ended up reaching Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s ears, they would end up suffering enormously.<br>But, no matter how they examined their surroundings, they were unable to find the person that had spoken to them.<br>This made them even more scared.<br>They were clearly the only two people in the palace, so why would another person&rsquo;s voice arise?<br>&ldquo;Who are you? Stop trying to be mysterious and get out here!&rdquo; Long Ruiyun shouted angrily after being unable to find the culprit.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve forgotten about me so soon?&rdquo;<br>The voice sounded again. However, when the voice sounded again, a beautiful woman also appeared.<br>Upon seeing the woman, shock filled Long Nanxun and Long Ruiyun&rsquo;s faces. Their expressions grew complicated.<br>At the same time, they felt disbelief.<br>The reason for that was because the person that had appeared before them was someone they had never expected.<br>The person was Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you? How? How did you get in here?&rdquo; Long Ruiyun asked with a stern voice.<br>She even looked around as she said those words.<br>She was trying to find Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s accomplice.<br>After all, she felt that it would be impossible for her to enter the palace on her own.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Old bitch, do you still remember what I told you today?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A loose tongue can cause a lot of trouble.&rdquo;<br>As Fumo Xin&rsquo;er spoke, her eyes narrowed, and a cold glint flashed through her eyes.<br>Long Ruiyun did not think much of Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s words.<br>She said nothing, and directly attacked her. She had unleashed her boundless oppressive might. Like a formless ferocious beast, her oppressive might swept forth to devour Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>But, after she released her oppressive might, Long Ruiyun was stunned.<br>A startled look appeared in her eyes. Then, it was replaced with fear.<br>At the beginning, she had been skeptical. However, at that moment she was certain.<br>Her oppressive might had been blocked by Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>Furthermore, she had not been helped by anyone this time around. Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was the one who had blocked her oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>But Long Ruiyun did not cease her attacks because of that.<br>Instead, she moved her hand towards her hair and pulled out the golden hairpin on her head.<br>The golden hairpin turned then into a golden ray of light the moment it left her hair, and shot straight for Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>The golden hairpin was very powerful.<br>As it shot forth, it even let out a dragon&rsquo;s roar.<br>It turned out that the hairpin was actually an Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>Furthermore, Long Ruiyun had used a very powerful martial skill to attack with her hairpin.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>Even though the hairpin was terrifying, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er merely extended her hand and grabbed at the hairpin. Just like that, she snatched the hairpin out of the air.<br>&ldquo;Insignificant trick.&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er clenched her first.<br>With a &lsquo;snap,&rsquo; the golden hairpin was crushed to pieces.<br>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;<br>Both Long Nanxun and Long Ruiyun were completely terrified by this scene.<br>The golden hairpin was an Incomplete Exalted Armament. It was extremely tough.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next instant, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s clothes fluttered and she released her oppressive might.<br>Once she released her oppressive might, the surrounding space began to collapse.<br>Both Long Nanxun and Long Ruiyun felt fatal danger.<br>That oppressive might was many times more terrifying than Long Shengbu&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;You, exactly who are you?&rdquo; asked Long Ruiyun. Fear filled her voice.<br>She and Long Nanxun had finally realized that the girl that they had thought to be rather weak was actually such a terrifying existence.<br>Not to mention the two of them, even if Long Shengbu were there, he would definitely not be a match for the girl either.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, you&rsquo;re frogs at the bottom of a well.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the panic and shock on Long Ruiyun and Long Nanxun&rsquo;s faces, the corners of Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s mouth rose into a sneer.<br>But the killing intent in her eyes did not decrease in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;Prepare to die.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er raised her arm and grabbed towards Long Ruiyun.<br>She was planning to tear Long Ruiyun&rsquo;s mouth to pieces with her very hands.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>But, when her hand was about to reach Long Ruiyun, another hand suddenly appeared and grabbed her wrist, stopping her attack.<br>Looking over, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s expression changed enormously.<br>Panic appeared on her face.<br>The person that had grabbed her wrist was Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandma.<br>&ldquo;Lady Gusu!&rdquo;<br>But, after seeing her grandma, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er did not address her as grandma. Instead, she addressed her as Lady Gusu.<br>Furthermore, her voice no longer had the intimacy from before. Instead, it was filled with reverence and fear.<br></p></div>
