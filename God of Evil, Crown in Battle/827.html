        <div> - Using Violence to Suppress Violence<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>At that moment, Chu Feng was standing still, blank-faced.<br>Not to mention looking with his naked eyes, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t even detect anything with his Spirit power.<br>However, Chu Feng knew Taikou wouldn&rsquo;t have said those words for no reason. So, he could only use the Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes and when he did, he was immediately shocked. He discovered a hidden person. Although he had intentionally concealed himself&mdash;thus his outline and shape were very blurry&mdash;with the powerful observational strength of the Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, Chu Feng was still able to identify him as the Earth King.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s waited here for a long time. He must have something to discuss with you, so I won&rsquo;t disturb you anymore.<br>&ldquo;However, Chu Feng, if you need anything in the future, you can find me at any time. But, remember, do not come to the Four Seas Academy again after today.&rdquo;<br>As Taikou spoke, he gave a palm-sized crystal to Chu Feng. It was a Sphere of Sealing, and within it there was strange energy that supported a creature&mdash;a Delivery Bird. Clearly, that Delivery Bird could find Taikou and would help Chu Feng send messages to him.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Senior Taikou.&rdquo; After receiving the Delivery Bird, Chu Feng once again expressed his gratitude towards Taikou.<br>Taikou didn&rsquo;t say anything more. With a smile worn on his face, as he waved his hand in farewell, he drifted away.<br>&ldquo;This person called Taikou truly is not simple. Chu Feng, do you know where he comes from?&rdquo; After Taikou left, the Earth King also appeared and came to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side.<br>&ldquo;I only know that this Senior Taikou is a Divine Instructor in the Four Seas Academy. As for anything else, I&rsquo;m not too certain either,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied truthfully.<br>&ldquo;Divine Instructor? &hellip;I truly didn&rsquo;t expect such a person to be hidden inside the Four Seas Academy.&rdquo; The Earth King remained looking in the direction of Taikou&rsquo;s departure, his eyes full of graveness and surprise.<br>&ldquo;Senior Earth King, is this Senior Taikou very powerful?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in an attempt to salvage more information. As a Martial King, and a Gold-cloak World Spiritist, the Earth King could likely understand Taikou&rsquo;s power much better than him.<br>&ldquo;This person&rsquo;s strength is far above mine,&rdquo; the Earth King responded.<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; After hearing those words, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but gasp deeply. Even though he already guessed that Taikou&rsquo;s strength was above the Earth King&rsquo;s, after he personally confirmed it, Chu Feng still felt disbelief, especially on the &ldquo;far&rdquo; word he spoke of&mdash;its meaning was extraordinary.<br>At that instant, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help looking back at Taikou, but only then did he discover that he had already disappeared. A question unavoidably popped into his mind at the same time it did to the Earth King&rsquo;s: Who exactly is this Taikou?!<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you know about the current circumstances of the Eastern Sea Region, right?&rdquo; the Earth King suddenly asked.<br>&ldquo;I do understand it a bit, but I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s accurate or not.&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded, then told the Earth King what he knew about the present situation.<br>&ldquo;Mm, it&rsquo;s not too far off. The present situation is as you said: the Immortal Execution Archipelago has formally declared war against the Crippling Night Demon Sect, and they are rallying allies from various place.<br>&ldquo;However, the Crippling Night Demon Sect will still be able to handle it. Actually, the reason I came to look for you is because there&rsquo;s something related to you. After a discussion between me, the Gold King, and the Wood King, we decided it&rsquo;s better for you to personally take care of this,&rdquo; the Earth King said.<br>&ldquo;Senior Earth King, what is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly asked. When he heard it was related to him, he subconsciously felt the news was nothing good.<br>&ldquo;Right now, the Immortal Execution Archipelago feels overwhelming hatred for my Crippling Night Demon Sect, but their hatred for you alone is in no way inferior to the hatred they feel towards entire Crippling Night Demon Sect, because the things you did were indeed enough to put them in a very difficult spot.<br>&ldquo;And, right now, they are unable to find you. The fury in their hearts cannot be released, so they redirect it towards those related to you.<br>&ldquo;At present, they already know you come from a place called the continent of the Nine Provinces. So, they know that there are definitely people close to you in the Nine Provinces. They&rsquo;ve decided to point their blades towards it and vent their hatred by destroying the Nine Provinces.<br>&ldquo;However, the Immortal Execution Archipelago still puts up a righteous appearance to the public, so due to their name, they cannot do too heartless of an action. As such, they&rsquo;ve set up a plan,&rdquo; the Earth King said.<br>&ldquo;What are they planning to do?&rdquo; Chu Feng quickly asked.<br>&ldquo;Heh.&rdquo; The Earth King first smiled proudly, then said, &ldquo;Members of the Crippling Night Demon Sect have been scattered throughout the Eastern Sea Region. Although this does cause the Crippling Night Demon Sect to be split, &lsquo;there are advantages for all disadvantages&rsquo;. The members in various areas have become a powerful net of information for us.<br>&ldquo;According to the report from one of our members, we have confirmation that the Immortal Execution Archipelago has hiddenly instructed a dynasty in the Eastern Sea Region. They want them to eradicate the continent of the Nine Provinces, using the excuse of seizing power.<br>&ldquo;As for that dynasty, they are merely a small force. Naturally, they don&rsquo;t dare to go against the intentions of the Immortal Execution Archipelago. So, several days ago, they have already started their journey. They are leading their entire clan&rsquo;s experts towards the continent of the Nine Provinces with the aim of commencing a massacre.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Dammit!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed greatly when he heard that. His fists subconsciously tightened, and on his face, what appeared coincident with his anger was worry. At this moment, in the continent of the Nine Provinces, there were indeed many people of importance to Chu Feng. Su Rou, Su Mei, Jiang Wushang, and Zhang Tianyi were at the Nine Provinces right now as well.<br>The Immortal Execution Archipelago had truly made a fierce move, and Chu Feng also knew who leaked the information to the Immortal Execution Archipelago, telling them he came from the Nine Provinces&mdash;the filthy Zi family.<br>&ldquo;Although the Immortal Execution Archipelago has made a fierce move, there&rsquo;s no need to panic. The Crippling Night Demon Sect has already prepared a response, and the reason I wanted to meet you so soon is to discuss this with you,&rdquo; the Earth King said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Senior Earth King, then what should I do?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo; He leapt forward and up, flying away from the Four Seas Academy. Chu Feng followed.<br>After they left the territory of the Four Seas Academy, they arrived above a vast sea. The waves of that sea were so high they could touch the sky. The violent gales wreaked havoc, and other than the surging sounds of waves, it was the roars of sea beasts.<br>But to the vast Eastern Sea Region, a sea like this was no more than usual. One could even say it was one of the most typical seas.<br>At first, Chu Feng felt confused as to why the Earth King brought him to this place. Just as he was about to ask, he heard a huge explosion. From the sea below, an enormous wave sprayed up.<br>As the surging wave rose into the sky and rolled around, an enormous thing also appeared within Chu Feng&rsquo;s line of sight.<br>It was a warship&mdash;a black-coloured warship. It flew out from the sea and gradually rose into the air.<br>That warship was extremely large. On the surface, there were not only many Spirit Formations that could both attack and defend, there were even many large palaces and towers. It was simply as if it were a small castle made by steel.<br>Most importantly, Chu Feng could see, at the very front steel deck of the warship, over a thousand people standing orderly. The weakest was in the seventh level of the Heaven realm, while the strongest was in the ninth level of the Heaven realm. All of them were at the peak of the Heaven realm.<br>*bang, bang, bang&hellip;*<br>Quickly after, nine more huge waves soared into the sky, and after the waves returned below, nine more enormous black-coloured warships had shot out from the sea. When they rose into the air, they slowly drifted up to Chu Feng, forming a line.<br>Not only did the nine other warships have the exact same layout as the first ship, even the number of people and their strength were extremely similar to the first warship&rsquo;s.<br>Ten warships, and over ten thousand experts at the peak of the Heaven realm, currently stood before Chu Feng.<br>*whoosh whoosh whoosh* Just at that moment, another thirty-eight people flew over from nearby, and orderly stood in front of Chu Feng and the Earth King. They were thirty-eight Martial Lords, and even though their cultivations were only at the early stages of the Martial Lord realm, they were Martial Lords nonetheless.<br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to Lord Earth King! We pay our respects to Lord Chu Feng!&rdquo; After coming up to them, the thirty-eight Martial Lords all half-knelt in the air simultaneously, and greeted the Earth King and Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to Lord Earth King! We pay our respects to Lord Chu Feng!&rdquo; At the same time, all of the Heaven realm experts on the ten warships simultaneously knelt onto the ground as well, greeting the Earth King and Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior Earth King, this is&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t really even know what to do when he saw that.<br>As for the Earth King, he lightly smiled and said, &ldquo;This is the response I&rsquo;ve prepared for you: using violence to suppress violence!&rdquo;<br></p></div>
