        <div> - What Is Your Motive<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Lord Valley Master, Chu Luyang was precisely killed by this child,&rdquo; Li Rui&rsquo;s master replied.<br>&ldquo;However, with his cultivation, how could he possibly possess the strength to kill Chu Luyang?&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master revealed a puzzled expression.<br>&ldquo;Lord Valley Master, this child used despicable means to murder Chu Luyang,&rdquo; Li Rui&rsquo;s master said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng wished that he could spit at Li Rui&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s face.<br>He thought to himself, &lsquo;This old fart truly dares to say anything. He actually started to put the label of despicable on my head.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;You really killed Chu Luyang?&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master turned to ask Chu Feng.<br>It was not as simple as a mere question; the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master was also observing Chu Feng. He was trying to see whether or not Li Rui&rsquo;s master had used any special martial techniques to forcibly restrict Chu Feng.<br>If Li Rui&rsquo;s master had truly used some sort martial technique to restrict Chu Feng, this Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master would naturally be able to tell with a single glance.<br>However, this was also the reason why Li Rui&rsquo;s master was clever. He seemed to knew this Valley Master very well, and knew that he would observe Chu Feng to determine whether or not Chu Feng had been restricted.<br>As such, he had not used martial techniques to suppress Chu Feng, and instead meticulously prepared that medicinal pellet for Chu Feng to be forced to take.<br>As for the result, it would naturally be the same as what Li Rui&rsquo;s master had anticipated. The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley master did not manage to detect the existence of the medicinal pellet.<br>&ldquo;I am asking you whether or not you killed Chu Luyang,&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master asked once again.<br>Upon seeing this, Li Rui&rsquo;s master tried to speak so that he could decide Chu Feng&rsquo;s crimes. However, to his surprise, Chu Feng actually nodded.<br>He had pleaded guilty?<br>Li Rui&rsquo;s master was very shocked to see that Chu Feng had actually nodded to it. Originally, he thought that even if Chu Feng couldn't speak, he would definitely not plead guilty.<br>However, Chu Feng had actually pleaded guilty. This made Li Rui&rsquo;s master very confused. He did not understand what Chu Feng was thinking.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng have nodded, the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master sighed and said, &ldquo;Chu Luyang is, after all, a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan. As he was a subordinate of our Sunset Cloud Valley, I must provide him with justice,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is why this subordinate wished to ask Lord Valley Master to convict this Chu Feng,&rdquo; Li Rui&rsquo;s master pleaded.<br>&ldquo;Is there even a need for me for something like this? According to the laws of our Sunset Cloud Valley, those that dare to kill people of our Sunset Cloud Valley are all to&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Before the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master could finish his words, an aged old lady hurried out from within the palace. She said, &ldquo;Lord Valley Master, this is bad! Lady Yan&rsquo;s illness has relapsed again!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s illness has relapsed again?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master hurriedly and worriedly stood up from his seat.<br>He had had an extremely calm expression earlier. However, at this moment, his face was covered with panic.<br>It could be seen that this Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master was a filial son. Else, he would not panic like that after finding out that his mother&rsquo;s illness had relapsed.<br>&ldquo;Elder Tuoba, I have ordered you to ask for an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, have you managed to find one?!&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master asked Li Rui&rsquo;s master.<br>&ldquo;Lord Valley Master, regarding this&hellip; Immortal-cloak World Spiritists are truly too difficult to find. This subordinate is incompetent. So far, I have yet to manage to successfully petition one,&rdquo; Li Rui&rsquo;s master said with an ashamed expression.<br>However, no one noticed that Li Rui&rsquo;s master took a stealthily glance at Chu Feng when he said those words.<br>Chu Feng noticed his gaze. From that gaze, Chu Feng saw a sinister smile.<br>He was smiling in complacence.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng came to a realization. Not only was the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master a person fond of talents, he was also someone who urgently needed the assistance of an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist to help cure his mother&rsquo;s illness.<br>In this sort of situation, if the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master found out that Chu Feng was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, Chu Feng would definitely be saved.<br>However, Chu Feng was unable to speak. He could only watch as the opportunity to survive slipped past him without him being able to grab onto it.<br>That was the reason why Li Rui&rsquo;s master was so complacent. He was feeling proud of how quick-witted he felt himself to be.<br>&ldquo;Go, go and ask for for an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist again. No matter what, you must successfully petition one,&rdquo; After the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master said those words, he followed that old lady and began to proceed toward the inside of the palace. Evidently, his mother was located inside the palace.<br>&ldquo;Lord Valley Master, then, what about this child?&rdquo; Li Rui&rsquo;s master hurriedly asked.<br>&ldquo;Is there even a need to ask? Kill him!!!&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master shouted.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Milord,&rdquo; At this moment, Li Rui&rsquo;s master once again revealed an extremely complacent smile.<br>Right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly spoke. &ldquo;Lord Valley Master, you wish to help cure your mother&rsquo;s illness, no? Perhaps myself would be able to help,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This!!!&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng spoke, Li Rui&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s expression immediately changed. He was frightened green in the face.<br>He truly could not understand how Chu Feng was able to speak after he was fed that medicinal pellet.<br>He had clearly heard that medicinal pellet to be something that even Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists would not be able to undo.<br>As for Chu Feng, he had only just become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Furthermore, he was also an Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. No matter what, he should not be able to undo the effects of that medicinal pellet.<br>Exactly what was going on? Why was he able to speak?<br>&ldquo;What did you say? You can cure my mother&rsquo;s illness?&rdquo; At this moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master turned his sharp gaze toward Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng felt killing intent in the gaze of that Valley Master.<br>Evidently, this Valley master did not believe that Chu Feng possessed the ability to treat his mother&rsquo;s illness. Thus, the first thing that came into his mind was that Chu Feng was deceiving him.<br>Furthermore, as he was worried and vexed for his mother&rsquo;s illness, his mood was extremely bad. As such, he would not be able to tolerate anyone deceiving him at such a time.<br>&ldquo;Lord Valley Master, do not listen to the crazy and unfounded ravings of this child. How could he possibly be able to treat Lady Yan&rsquo;s illness?&rdquo;<br>At this moment, Li Rui&rsquo;s master started to panic. He hurriedly walked toward Chu Feng and used his boundless martial power to restrict Chu Feng, preventing him from babbling nonsense again.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at this moment, boundless spirit power suddenly burst forth from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>It was Immortal-level spirit power. At this moment, not only was the spirit power hovering around Chu Feng, it was also being controlled by Chu Feng.<br>Being enveloped by this spirit power, Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura became completely different. It was as if he were a grand expert.<br>&ldquo;Lord Valley Master, do you recognize this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked loudly.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng had actually unleashed his Immortal level spirit power, Li Rui&rsquo;s master started to panic even more. He unleashed his surging martial power with the intention of beating down Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power.<br>&ldquo;Stop!!!&rdquo;<br>However, right at this moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master shouted furiously.<br>Once that furious shout was heard, a boundlessly powerful oppressive might swept forth. It not only forcibly scattered Li Rui&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s oppressive might, it also forced Li Rui&rsquo;s master back several steps, nearly knocking him to the ground.<br>&ldquo;Tuoba Shangshui, is this how you handle things?!!!&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master pointed at Li Rui&rsquo;s master and shouted furiously.<br>Seeing that the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master was furious, Li Rui&rsquo;s master hurriedly kneeled to the ground. He said, &ldquo;Lord Valley Master, this subordinate does not know what he did wrong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You do not know what you did wrong? I asked you to go and petition an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist to treat my mother&rsquo;s illness.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the end, after seeking and asking for so long, you&rsquo;ve yet to successfully request an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. If that was even true.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, right now, there is clearly an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist standing right before you. Why did you not tell me about this?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly what is your motive?&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master stared at Li Rui&rsquo;s master furiously.<br>This Valley Master was truly angered.<br><br></p></div>
