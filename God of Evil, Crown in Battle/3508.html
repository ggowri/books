        <h1>Chapter 3507</h1>
        <div> - Exalted-level Sacred Temple Bead<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior, although it sounds very absurd, I believe that big sister Liluo is still alive,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This old man also hopes that young lady Liluo is still alive,&rdquo; said Wuming Xingyun.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I'm afraid that I will have to leave. That said, before leaving, I must bid my farewells to Clan Chief Tantai,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well, this old man will accompany you,&rdquo; then, Chu Feng and Wuming Xingyun found the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>When the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief learned that Chu Feng planned to leave immediately, he tried his best to urge him to stay. However, after he learned that Chu Feng had an important matter that he had to leave to take care of, he knew that he had no choice but to let him leave.<br>That said, he prepared a grand gift, and insisted that Chu Feng accept it.<br>It was an extremely generous gift.<br>To be exact, they were multiple gifts.<br>The reason the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief gave for preparing those gifts for Chu Feng was very simple. He stated that since Bai Liluo had disappeared in their Tantai Heavenly Clan and they did not know if she was still alive, he, like Wuming Xingyun, felt ashamed and guilty.<br>Although he was given such generous gifts, Chu Feng actually did not want them.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that he was acting haughty. He was not that sort of person. Had it been before, he would accept those gifts. At the very most, he would return them when he became capable of doing so in the future.<br>However, Chu Feng could not accept those gifts.<br>He does not wish to receive those gifts because of Bai Liluo&rsquo;s disappearance.<br>That would instead make him feel that he had betrayed Bai Liluo, and make him feel guilty.<br>However, to Chu Feng&rsquo;s surprise, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief insisted that he accept the gifts.<br>Furthermore, he stated that he would not let Chu Feng leave should he refuse to accept the gifts.<br>Judging from the way he behaved, he was not just putting on airs. Instead, he was really planning to detain Chu Feng.<br>Helpless, Chu Feng symbolically accepted the gifts.<br>The gifts were composed of four beads.<br>Chu Feng had seen similar sorts of beads before. Not only that, but he had even used them before.<br>It was something that Li Yue&rsquo;er had given him.<br>The beads were called Sacred Temple Beads. The Sacred Temple Beads were composed of two types - locking beads and opening beads.<br>Should the two beads be placed together, one would be able to enter a special place - the Sacred Heavenly Temple.<br>Furthermore, Sacred Temple Beads differed by levels.<br>Back then, the Sacred Temple Bead that Li Yue&rsquo;er gave Chu Feng was a True Immortal-level Sacred Temple Bead.<br>As for the four Sacred Temple Beads that the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had prepared for Chu Feng, they were much more precious than the one that Li Yue&rsquo;er had given him back then; they were Exalted-level Sacred Temple Beads.<br>In fact, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had prepared more than only four Exalted-level Sacred Temple Beads for Chu Feng. He had prepared ten locking beads and ten opening beads for a total of twenty Exalted-level Sacred Temple Beads.<br>Apart from that, there were also Martial Immortal-level Sacred Temple Beads. The number of those were even greater, numbering a total of a hundred.<br>However, Chu Feng only accepted four Exalted-level Sacred Temple Beads.<br>The reason for that was because he planned to return Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s favor. This was especially true upon thinking that he might be able to meet her soon.<br>Thus, even though Chu Feng did not wish to accept the gifts, he still ended up taking four Exalted-level Sacred Temple Beads.<br>&ldquo;Senior, can you allow this Chu Feng to leave now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that young friend Chu Feng is truly not a greedy person. Since that&rsquo;s the case, I will no longer try to make things difficult for you,&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said with a sigh.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you are mistaken. I, Chu Feng, am a very greedy individual. However, my greed depends on the situation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;As the saying goes, one should not be rewarded if it&rsquo;s undeserved. Senior, you don't owe me anything. I should not be accepting gifts from you to begin with. I'm already acting excessively by accepting the four Sacred Temple Beads, how could I accept more?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, that cannot be considered to be an underserved reward. After all, there is one thing that I will need young friend Chu Feng and Lord Wuming Xingyun&rsquo;s help with,&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, could you be talking about the Black-feathered Specter?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Chu Feng had already managed to guess that the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief actually wanted Chu Feng and Wuming Xingyun to maintain confidentiality in the matter regarding the Black-feathered Specter.<br>After all, to the Tantai Heavenly Clan, this matter would not be something brilliant and honorable. Furthermore, if someone were to learn that such a terrifying monster was imprisoned beneath the Tantai Heavenly Clan, it would definitely affect the Tantai Heavenly Clan. For the people that viewed the Tantai Heavenly Clan as their enemy, the effect would be even greater.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng is an intelligent man. Since that&rsquo;s the case, I will have to trouble you,&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief clasped his fist.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please believe in this Chu Feng&rsquo;s character. I will definitely not mention this matter to anyone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, before leaving, this junior also has a presumptuous request,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, there's no harm in saying what&rsquo;s on your mind,&rdquo; the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;I would like to see that Black-feathered Specter again,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>The Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief hesitated upon hearing those words. However, ultimately, he agreed to Chu Feng&rsquo;s request.<br>Then, Chu Feng and the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief went underground, and arrived before the formation core of the grand demon suppression formation. They were once again before the Black-feathered Specter.<br>The power of the grand demon suppression formation had increased. The aura of the Black-feathered Specter had grown slightly weaker. Apart from that, there were no changes at all.<br>The Black-feathered Specter was still completely tight-lipped. It refused to utter a single word besides its strange low growls.<br>This time around, Chu Feng did not stay too long. After a short moment, he proceeded to leave.<br>However, after leaving, Chu Feng&rsquo;s mood became even better.<br>Chu Feng returned to the palace that served as his residence in the Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>As Chu Feng was really planning to leave, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and elders were all determined to see him off.<br>However, after a short exchange of words of farewell, as he was leaving the palace, Chu Feng suddenly spoke.<br></p></div>
