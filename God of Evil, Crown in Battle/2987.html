        <div> - Harming Chu Feng<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Chu Qing did not attempt to strike up a conversation with Chu Feng. He merely left a simple and polite farewell before leaving.<br>Rather than saying Chu Qing had come to challenge Her Lady Queen, it would be more accurate to say that Chu Qing had come to call to Chu Feng's attention that he was already the strongest member of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm's younger generation.<br>"Milady Queen, are you alright?"<br>Although Eggy had not suffered any injuries, Chu Feng was still worried for her. Chu Feng was worried about Eggy's frame of mind.<br>After all, Her Lady Queen was a very proud individual. Ending today's confrontation in a tie would not suit Her Lady Queen's expectations.<br>"If I were to tell you that this Queen still hasn't gone all-out, would you believe me?" Her Lady Queen asked.<br>"I would. Of course I would believe you. Thus, Milady Queen, you deliberately went easy on him?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"Why would I go easy on him? I merely..."<br>"Forget about it. You'll understand one day," Her Lady Queen spoke in a proud manner. She hesitated for a moment, and then laughed out loud. "It's alright, this Queen is not that overly sensitive. It's merely a tie, there's nothing wrong with it. You don't have to worry."<br>Seeing such a reaction from Her Lady Queen, Chu Feng became even more worried. He decided to sit cross-legged and cast his awareness into his world spirit space so that he could chat with Her Lady Queen face-to-face.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Yue's mother was searching for Chu Yue.<br>That startled expression still remained on her face.<br>The scene earlier was simply too astonishing.<br>She felt that Chu Feng and Chu Qing's future potential were simply unbounded.<br>She ignored Chu Qing. After all, Chu Qing did not possess any friendship with Chu Yue. But Chu Feng could not be ignored, as his relationship with Chu Yue was most definitely much more intimate than his relationship with any other Chu Heavenly Clansman.<br>As Chu Yue's mother, she had to make sure that Chu Yue seized this opportunity. That was why she was in such a rush to find Chu Yue; she wanted to inform her of the matter as soon as possible.<br>However, when Chu Yue's mother arrived at the location where the Chu Heavenly Clan's younger generation retrieved their Yin Yang Fate Pearls, she discovered that Chu Yue had already left.<br>However, she also did not encounter Chu Yue on her way here. This caused Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother to become very puzzled.<br>Confused by where Chu Yue went, Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother began to search for her. She even activated a special sort of observation technique.<br>Finally, Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother found Chu Yue at a hidden location.<br>It was not only Chu Yue she found. She also discovered someone she disliked greatly, Chu Haoyan.<br>When Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother discovered her, Chu Haoyan was leaving. As for Chu Yue, she was standing there with a difficult expression on her face. Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother had no idea what had happened between them.<br>&ldquo;Chu Haoyan, stop right there!&rdquo; Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother shouted and landed beside Chu Yue.<br>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Chu Haoyan turned around and asked with a very disdainful attitude.<br>&ldquo;What did you do to Yue&rsquo;er?&rdquo; Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother asked.<br>&ldquo;What did I do to her? Isn&rsquo;t she standing there completely unharmed? Rather than asking me what I did, why don&rsquo;t you ask her?&rdquo; Chu Haoyan said with contempt. Then, he turned around.<br>Even though Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother was his senior, he did not respect her in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;Yue&rsquo;er, are you alright?&rdquo; Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother asked Chu Yue. Chu Yue was, after all, her child. As such, how could she not worry for her?<br>&ldquo;Mother, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Chu Yue said.<br>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother grabbed Chu Yue and left.<br>When they appeared again, they appeared in Chu Yue&rsquo;s home instead of Chu Feng&rsquo;s residence.<br>&ldquo;Did Chu Haoyan threaten you?&rdquo; Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother asked.<br>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Chu Yue shook her head.<br>&ldquo;Then tell me honestly, why did Chu Haoyan come looking for you?&rdquo; Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother asked.<br>&ldquo;Mother, I&rsquo;m really fine,&rdquo; Chu Yue said.<br>&ldquo;Yue&rsquo;er, you absolutely must not allow yourself to be exploited by that Chu Haoyan,&rdquo; Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother told her in a very serious manner. As Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother was a member of the Law Enforcement Hall, she realized that Chu Haoyan must have sought her for some sort of conspiracy.<br>Hearing what her mother said, Chu Yue&rsquo;s little face immediately changed somewhat. She seemed to be confessing even without being pressed to do so.<br>&ldquo;Yue&rsquo;er, I know that you&rsquo;ve always wanted to get closer to Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu, Chu Ruoshi and Chu Lingxi.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, after all these years, you should know what sort of people they are. You will never be able to get close to them. The reason for that is because they simply feel that you do not possess the qualifications to be near them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Chu Feng is different. Chu Feng did not look down on you. Instead, he considered you as his family, his older sister.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Moreover, Chu Feng possesses potential even stronger than theirs.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You must know this: today, Chu Feng&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother wanted to tell Chu Yue what she had witnessed today.<br>However, before Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother could explain to her what she had seen, Chu Yue interrupted her. &ldquo;But, Lady Mother, Chu Feng is alone and weak. No one in our Chu Heavenly Clan is backing him. How far could he possibly go by relying only on himself?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is my Law Enforcement Hall&rsquo;s Lord Vice Hall Master not Chu Feng&rsquo;s backer?&rdquo; Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother asked.<br>&ldquo;How could Senior Zhengfa compare to Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather, an Supreme Elder, by himself?&rdquo; Chu Yue said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather?&rdquo; Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother smiled slightly. Then, she said, &ldquo;Not to mention Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandfather, just Chu Feng&rsquo;s father was absolutely not someone that Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather could be compared to.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mother, I&rsquo;ve heard about Chu Feng&rsquo;s father from you many times already. But, if his father is truly that powerful, why would he be imprisoned in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm&rsquo;s forbidden area?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why would he look on as his son&rsquo;s forehead was branded with the word &lsquo;trash?&rsquo; Why would he submit to humiliation like that?&rdquo; Chu Yue asked.<br>&ldquo;That is something that the people of our clan have never been able to understand. We cannot guess exactly what someone like Chu Xuanyuan is thinking,&rdquo; Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother said.<br>&ldquo;No, I think I&rsquo;ve figured it out,&rdquo; Chu Yue said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve figured it out?&rdquo; Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother revealed an astonished expression.<br>&ldquo;I think Chu Xuanyuan was indeed very powerful at one point. However, that is in the past, and not now,&rdquo; Chu Yue said.<br>&ldquo;Yue&rsquo;er, you are truly foolish,&rdquo; when Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother said those words, anger was present in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Lady Mother, please don&rsquo;t get angry. I am merely stating my opinion. However, that is not merely my opinion, that is also the opinion of many people in the clan right now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If Chu Feng&rsquo;s father and grandfather truly possessed such deterring power, no one in our clan would dare to make things difficult for Chu Feng. However, the situation at hand is the complete opposite of that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even back then, if Chu Xuanyuan was truly as powerful as you say, how could the people of our Chu Heavenly Clan dare to punish him so severely?&rdquo; Chu Yue asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re planning to be exploited by Chu Haoyan and help him take care of Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do not forget who helped you obtain your qualifications to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain in the first place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yue&rsquo;er, mother can understand your desire for a better future. However, a person must not break faith and abandon what&rsquo;s right. One must not repay kindness with hatred,&rdquo; Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s tone had grown heavier and heavier. It would appear that she was truly angry.<br>She was afraid, afraid that Chu Yue would bring harm to Chu Feng for the sake of her own self-interest.<br>&ldquo;Lady Mother, how could I not know the assistance little brother Chu Feng has given me? Rest assured, I will definitely not help Chu Haoyan harm little brother Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Yue said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, Chu Haoyan indeed sought your help to harm Chu Feng? What does he want you to do?&rdquo; Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother revealed a worried look.<br>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell me anything because I refused him the moment he brought it up.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior Zhengfa has treated me very well. Little brother Chu Feng has also treated me very well. However, that Chu Haoyan looked down on me in the past, and started to deliberately make things difficult for me when I got close to little brother Chu Feng. How could I help a person like him?&rdquo; Chu Yue said.<br>&ldquo;Yue&rsquo;er, mother is reassured to hear you say those words,&rdquo; at that moment, Chu Yue&rsquo;s mother finally heaved a sigh of relief.<br><br><br></p></div>
