        <div>: The Scheme Against the Moon Immortal<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From the moment that Chu Feng plunged his sword into Hun Lei&rsquo;s dantian, Hun Lei&rsquo;s life was already in his grasp.<br>No matter how powerful Hun Lei might be, he didn&rsquo;t stand a chance against Chu Feng anymore.<br>Faced with the tearful Hun Lei, Chu Feng actually felt a little gladdened at the moment.<br>Due to Song Yun fooling him to consume the Conquerstar Soul Poison, he ended up losing his cultivation temporarily. It was for this reason that he was unable to do anything about the arrogant disciples of the Locksoul Sect earlier on.<br>However, his cultivation had already started to recover by then, which was also the reason why he didn&rsquo;t fear them at all. He knew that he would be able to deal with them very soon.<br>It was just that Shengguang Jin&rsquo;an ended up interfering before he could do anything. That being said, it might have been a good thing since his cultivation wasn&rsquo;t fully recovered then.<br>While they made their way over to the Divine Cavern and Demon Cavern, his cultivation was still swiftly surging back up, and it was only when he noticed that something was amiss with Hun Lei and Hun Yong that his cultivation finally returned back to normal.<br>It was fortunate that the recovery was in time, or else he would have never been able to follow Hun Lei all the way here, let alone assault him.<br>It was true that Hun Lei had his guard down, but ultimately, he was still a rank eight Utmost Exalted level cultivator, allowing him to travel at incredible speeds. If Chu Feng&rsquo;s recovery had been any slower, Hun Lei would have very well given him the slip.<br>For that reason, Chu Feng felt deeply gladdened.<br>Otherwise, if Su Rou and Su Mei were really harmed by Hun Lei, he would have never been able to live with it.<br>With such thoughts in mind, Chu Feng glared at Hun Lei with even greater rage than before.<br>The person standing before him was someone who had just tried to kill Su Rou and Su Mei.<br>Putong!<br>Sensing the increasing hostility in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes, Hun Lei quickly kneeled down and exclaimed, &ldquo;This brother over here, please don&rsquo;t kill me! I&rsquo;m begging you, please let me off!<br>&ldquo;I know that the disciples of our sect have treated you with disrespect earlier, but that has nothing to do with me! As long as you let me off, I swear that I&rsquo;ll teach those fools a lesson for you! I&rsquo;ll kill them for you! Or if you want to kill them with your own hands, I&rsquo;ll help you too! I&rsquo;ll capture them and place them before you so that you can do as you please to them.<br>&ldquo;So, brother, please spare me! I have many people that I need to take care of!&rdquo;<br>Hun Lei&rsquo;s face was dripped with tears and snot, making him very pathetic and humble. He was no longer the lofty genius that stood above the others anymore.<br>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t feel any sympathy for such a Hun Lei at all.<br>The other party had said with his own mouth that he would capture his own peers over so that Chu Feng could have his way with them. He might have been begging for mercy, but his words revealed just how much of an unscrupulous person he was.<br>&ldquo;You were thinking of assimilating those two women inside, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>It was none of his business what kind of person Hun Lei was. The only ones he was concerned about were Su Mei and Su Rou.<br>&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hun Lei&rsquo;s face froze up. He suddenly realized that Chu Feng was not doing this because of the other disciples of the Locksoul Sect offending him. It was because of the two women!<br>&ldquo;This brother over here, are you acquainted with the two women in there?&rdquo; Hun Lei asked fearfully.<br>If Chu Feng was doing this because of his grudge with the other disciples of the Locksoul Sect, he might still be able to wiggle his way out of it by putting on a subservient attitude.<br>However, if Chu Feng was doing this because of the two women&hellip; he could very well lose his life here.<br>He knew that he had the bad habit of talking to himself when he was alone. Putting aside what he had been doing all this while, just the words he had said was more than enough to reveal the malicious intentions he had toward those two women.<br>On the other hand, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t respond right away. Instead, he shot a glance at Su Rou and Su Mei for a moment before finally replying, &ldquo;They are my wives.&rdquo;<br>Wives?!<br>Holy shit!<br>Those two words rumbled in Hun Lei&rsquo;s ears like a deafening peal of thunder, leaving his heart feeling as if it was sinking deep into despair.<br>It was at this moment that he realized that he had screwed up badly.<br>&ldquo;Brother, I&rsquo;m really sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean what I said earlier. Please, spare me!&rdquo; Hun Lei begged desperately for mercy.<br>&ldquo;Brother, I am only doing this under the order of another person. I have no grudge with your wives at all! It&rsquo;s all the orders of the Conquerstar Mountain Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master!&rdquo; Hun Lei explained frantically out of fear.<br>&ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;S-speak&hellip; what?&rdquo; Hun Lei was stunned.<br>&ldquo;Tell me everything that you know about this. Don&rsquo;t hide anything from me, or else I&rsquo;ll make you suffer a fate worse than death!&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Hearing those words, Hun Lei immediately told Chu Feng everything he knew without daring to hide anything at all.<br>As it turned out, the Moon Immortal wasn&rsquo;t a burglar at all.<br>She had met the Conquerstar Mountain Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master by a stroke of coincidence, and the latter found out that the Moon Immortal possessed the peculiar ability to awaken the true immortal energy within the Conquerstar Immortal Grass.<br>The only issue with that was that the Moon Immortal would die from the backlash if she were to attempt to do so.<br>Knowing that there was no way the Moon Immortal would sacrifice herself to help him, the Conquerstar Mountain Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master hatched a scheme to exploit the Moon Immortal&rsquo;s ability.<br>On the surface, he invited the Moon Immortal into the Divine Cavern, offering the Conquerstar Immortal Grass to the Moon Immortal to raise her cultivation.<br>But in truth, he was planning to make use of the power of the formation to assimilate the Moon Immortal and turn the Conquerstar Immortal Grass into a supreme cultivation treasure.<br>Everything proceeded quite smoothly at the start. In the moment that the Moon Immortal consumed the Conquerstar Immortal Grass, he would activate the formation to suppress the Moon Immortal and assimilate the Moon Immortal instead.<br>However, who could have thought that he would have ended up underestimating the Moon Immortal?<br>The Conquerstar Immortal Grass was, in fact, one of the sources of energy behind the formation cast over this forbidden cultivation ground, and after consuming it, the Moon Immortal managed to acquire partial control over the formation.<br>And as soon as the Moon Immortal realized that something was amiss, she immediately used the power of the formation to oppose the Conquerstar Mountain Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master, resulting in the plan to fall through.<br>In order to turn the tables on the Moon Immortal, the Conquerstar Mountain Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master tried to send his juniors to the forbidden cultivation ground to strengthen his control over the formation by activating the other formation core located at the bottom of the mountain range.<br>However, it was also then that he realized that activating the formation core was no easy feat. One would have to pay a heavy price for it.<br>The juniors of the Conquerstar Mountain Villa were simply too lacking in cultivation. Not only were they unable to control the power of the formation core, but they even ended up suffering a severe backlash from it too.<br>Of the seven juniors dispatched, five had died and the other two suffered severe injuries.<br>They might not have been the strongest juniors of their Conquerstar Mountain Villa, but they were still their elites.<br>Left with no choice, the Conquerstar Mountain Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master ended up approaching the Locksoul Sect&rsquo;s Hun Lei and Hun Yong for help. As they had cooperated on various other matters in the past, he still trusted the two of them quite a bit.<br>Like they said, birds of the same feather flock together.<br></p></div>
