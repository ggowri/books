        <h1>Chapter 3157</h1>
        <div> - Reignited Fighting Spirit<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Henceforth, we shall be the ruler of that territory, and they shall be our slaves!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words were akin to thunder. His words continued to echo through the surroundings.<br>However, in the hearts of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, Chu Feng&rsquo;s words were many tens of thousands of times more resounding than thunder. Even their souls were shaken by Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>They had truly never expected the way Chu Feng would take revenge to be like this. He was actually planning to retrieve their former territory. That was something that they had never imagined before.<br>However, did they never want to retrieve their lost territory?<br>That was territory that had originally belonged to them.<br>&ldquo;Humph, you are truly indulging in fantasy. The strongest individual in the Burnfield Monstrous Clan is a rank nine Heavenly Immortal. How exactly are you supposed to retrieve our territory from them?&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, someone immediately poured cold water all over him. As for that person, he would naturally be Chu Hongyi.<br>However, Chu Feng completely ignored him.<br>Chu Hongyi was someone who acted extremely tyrannical, unyielding and even completely unreasonable toward his relatives and friends.<br>However, he was a coward against his enemies, so much so that he did not even dare to offend those weaker than him.<br>Chu Feng felt that someone like Chu Hongyi was not even qualified to speak to him. He was simply trash, through and through.<br>Chu Feng looked down on Chu Hongyi from the bottom of his heart. As such, he acted as if he did not hear Chu Hongyi&rsquo;s ridicule, and turned to ask the crowd, &ldquo;Is there anyone that is willing to accompany me to the Burnfield Monstrous Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, have you gone crazy?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing for you to throw away your own life, but you actually want everyone to accompany you in death? Chu Feng, have you gone insane? Go on and get away from here. No one is going to willingly throw their lives away with you,&rdquo; Chu Hongyi continued to ridicule Chu Feng. Furthermore, he was extremely confident when he said those words.<br>He knew those Chu Heavenly Clansmen extremely well, and knew that they were all cowards, that they wouldn&rsquo;t possibly follow Chu Feng and risk their lives.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I am willing to accompany you!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, bring me along!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Add me to the list!&rdquo;<br>However, right after Chu Hongyi&rsquo;s words left his mouth, there were immediately several Chu Heavenly Clansmen that loudly voiced their desire to accompany Chu Feng. As they did so, they moved toward him. They were really planning to accompany him.<br>Originally, the ones that had voiced their desire to accompany Chu Feng were all people that Chu Feng had rescued earlier, people that felt grateful toward him, and thoroughly disappointed with Chu Hongyi.<br>However, as those people began to follow Chu Feng, more and more people chose to follow him.<br>In the end, even those that were not rescued by Chu Feng that day decided to follow him.<br>In the blink of an eye, the great majority of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were standing beside Chu Feng. Looking toward Chu Hongyi&rsquo;s side, there were actually only several people remaining there.<br>&ldquo;Have you all gone insane?! You&rsquo;re really planning to throw your lives away following him?!&rdquo;<br>Chu Hongyi&rsquo;s eyes turned perfectly round with shock. Disbelief and puzzlement filled his eyes.<br>&ldquo;So what if we are to throw our lives away? I&rsquo;ve had enough of this sort of life, of lowering our heads and being trampled upon by others. Even if I am to throw away my life today, I will still accompany Chu Feng. I will have them know that our Chu Heavenly Clan is not a bunch of cowards!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Well said! Even if we are to throw away our lives, we will still go!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Chu Hongyi, if you want to continue to act like a turtle, then you can continue to do so. Your daddy has no time to play with you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. From today on, with a word from little brother Chu Feng, even if I am to climb a mountain of blades or descend into a sea of flames, I will still be willing to follow him. As for you, Chu Hongyi, no matter what you say, I will never again listen to you. For you are someone who refused to save your brothers and sisters of the same clan. You are not qualified to lead us, not qualified to criticize little brother Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>Chu Hongyi had originally thought that he would be able to change the crowd&rsquo;s hearts with his words. However, never did he expect that he would instead be lashed out at by the crowd.<br>&ldquo;You all, you all&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Hongyi turned green in the face. He was completely baffled by the crowd&rsquo;s reprimands.<br>These were all people that used to obey his every word in the past, people that did not dare to say no to him. Yet now, they actually dared to publicly lash out at him. He found this to be completely unacceptable.<br>Chu Hongyi had no idea that Chu Feng&rsquo;s words had reignited the hearts of those Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>They were not nobodies to begin with. In the past, they were all proud and unyielding geniuses.<br>They had only become so weak and cowardly after being led around by Chu Hongyi after coming here.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s words had awoken them.<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, will not force everyone here today, for I am not fighting for myself. Instead, I am fighting for our Chu Heavenly Clan. For those that are willing to follow me, regardless of victory or defeat, I, Chu Feng, will share our future glory, splendor and wealth with everyone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, those that are unwilling to accompany me, my apologies, but your life and death from now on will no longer have anything to do with me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the reason why, it is simply because I look down on trash that only dares to be tyrants at home, but become complete cowards against our enemies.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was looking at Chu Hongyi and the others as he said those words. After he finished saying those words, he turned around.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, please wait.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will also accompany you.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, of the few people beside Chu Hongyi, five stood up and arrived beside Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, only two people remained beside Chu Hongyi.<br>Seeing this, Chu Hongyi&rsquo;s complexion immediately turned from green to white. His expression was very ugly. Those people&hellip; were his trusted aides.<br>&ldquo;You all, you&rsquo;re really planning to follow him?! If you all are to follow him today, you will no longer be brothers of I, Chu Hongyi!&rdquo; Chu Hongyi shouted angrily<br>&ldquo;Big brother Hongyi, we&rsquo;re sorry. We don&rsquo;t wish to remain cowards our whole life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Big brother Hongyi, I feel what little brother Chu Feng says to be very correct. We have not come to the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm to become cowards and disgrace our Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all these years, I seemed to have forgotten about my lofty aspirations when I first entered this place. I turned into someone that was no longer myself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We have suffered enough lowly days. Even if we are to be striking a stone with an egg and attempt the impossible this time around, I still wish to stand strong for once.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I would rather die standing than live kneeling.&rdquo;<br>Chu Hongyi&rsquo;s trusted aides were also affected by Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. At that moment, they appeared to be burning with fighting spirit, and had gained an enormous amount of courage.<br>&ldquo;Very well, go on then, all of you, go on then! After you all die, I, your daddy will not go and retrieve your corpses!&rdquo; Chu Hongyi shouted with incomparable rage.<br>&ldquo;Chu Hongyi, you can continue to remain here. However, you must not set foot into the Burnfield Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s territory again. The reason for that is because from today on, that place will belong to the people of our Chu Heavenly Clan that possess moral backbone and not cowards like you all,&rdquo; after Chu Feng finished saying those words, he soared into the sky.<br>After Chu Feng soared into the sky, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen also soared into the sky and began flying toward the Burnfield Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s territory following Chu Feng.<br>The sky was extremely large. With only a little more than a hundred people flying in the sky, they looked very insignificant. Furthermore, as they were flying very fast, they soon disappeared over the horizon.<br>At that moment, the two people that remained beside Chu Hongyi asked simultaneously, &ldquo;Big brother Hongyi, do you think Chu Feng will succeed?&rdquo;<br>There was a deep sense of unease and worry in their eyes. They were not worried about the safety of Chu Feng and the others. Instead, they were afraid that Chu Feng would succeed.<br>&ldquo;Humph, be at complete ease. They will all become the Burnfield Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s slaves, and regret following Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Hongyi was extremely confident when he said those words. In fact, there was even a trace of hatred on his face.<br>More than anyone, he wanted Chu Feng to fail, and those people that had followed him to all be tortured by the Burnfield Monstrous Clan.<br>The greater the misery that would befall upon Chu Feng and the others, the more joyous he would be.<br>Chu Hongyi was not only a coward, he was also extremely despicable, and never cared about the honor and disgrace of his clan. He was simply an embodiment of absolute selfishness.<br></p></div>
