        <div> - Demon Armament Suppression Talisman<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><br>&ldquo;So what if it&rsquo;s the Demon Armament? Don&rsquo;t you have the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman?&rdquo; The Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Right, Demon Armament Suppression Talisman, I have the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman,&rdquo; The Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief came to a sudden realization.<br><br>Then, he put away one of his Ancestral Armaments. He took out the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman and held it in his hand. [1. I guess he was using both of his Ancestral Armaments earlier.]<br><br>After holding the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman, the expression of the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief changed instantly.<br>His body was no longer shivering. Even the expression of fear on his face disappeared. In fact, he actually revealed a proud smile.<br><br>Due to being overly scared earlier, he had completely forgotten about the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman.<br><br>However, once he held the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman in his hand, he was immediately filled with confidence.<br>The reason for that was because he discovered that the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman in his hand was completely different from before.<br>Enormous power was surging within it. It was as if it had discovered its mortal enemy, and was eagerly excited to battle.<br>This sort of sensation was not present in the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman before Chu Feng had revealed his Evil God Sword.<br>This most likely meant that the reaction of the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman was brought forth by Chu Feng&rsquo;s Evil God Sword.<br>Thus, the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief started to believe with even greater certainty that the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman possessed enormous effectiveness toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s Demon Armament. He felt that regardless of how powerful Chu Feng&rsquo;s Demon Armament might be, he would not be able to unleash its might should he use the talisman.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, did you really think that you could take care of our Kong and Zhou Heavenly Clans merely by relying on a Demon Armament?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you think you can, then give it a try. I will let you know how incompetent you really are,&rdquo; The Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said to Chu Feng.<br>The current Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief no longer possessed any of the fear he had displayed earlier. On the contrary, he now had an utterly confident expression on his face. His gaze seemed to be saying that Chu Feng was destined to be defeated by his hand today.<br>&ldquo;Why are you suddenly so confident?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed. Then, he looked to the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman that the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief held in his hand. He thought to himself, &ldquo;Could it be because of that?&rdquo;<br>Not only was the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman emitting a mysterious Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura, but the words &lsquo;Demon Suppression&rsquo; were also inscribed onto it.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that was most definitely an extraordinary treasure.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it seems that Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief has managed to obtain a treasure capable of restraining your Evil God Sword,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br><br>&ldquo;Even if that is the case, I have no way to retreat from this.&rdquo;<br><br>As Chu Feng spoke, he infused his power into the Evil God Sword.<br>The next moment, layer upon layer of crimson gaseous flames began to emit from the Evil God Sword nonstop. Then, they completely enveloped Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br><br>Right at that moment, rumbles began to sound from the sky.<br><br>Looking upward, crimson clouds were appearing above Chu Feng. Furthermore, they were rapidly spreading. In an instant, the clouds covered the entire Kong Heavenly Clan.<br>As the crimson clouds surged about, they only emitted a single sort of aura, a demonic aura.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At this moment, Zi Xunyi&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>&ldquo;Is that the power of a Demon Armament?&rdquo;<br>Even the Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the five Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elders revealed a change in expression.<br>They were all able to sense how powerful the aura coming from Chu Feng was. It was something that they were incapable of contending against.<br>&ldquo;This bastard.&rdquo;<br>Sensing the power of Chu Feng&rsquo;s Evil God Sword again, the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief stood there stunned.<br><br>His body started to shiver. Even though he was holding the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman, he was still extremely panicky. He was simply unable to control the fear deep in his heart.<br><br>Evidently, the Evil God Sword had already left behind an unerasable shadow in his heart two years ago.<br><br>In fact, frightened screams were sounding from all over the Kong Heavenly Clan at that moment, furthermore, the Kong Heavenly Clansmen were frantically flying away from their clan so as to escape into the distance.<br>Those were all Kong Heavenly Clansmen who had experienced the might of the Evil God Sword two years ago.<br><br>Not only did the massacre from two years ago leave a shadow in the heart of the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, it had also left a shadow in the hearts of those fleeing Kong Heavenly Clansmen.<br><br>The moment when they felt the aura of the Evil God Sword again, their hearts&rsquo; defenses instantly crumbled.<br><br>At that moment, the entire Kong Heavenly Clan entered a state of chaos.<br><br>&ldquo;Why are you still standing there blankly, use the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman!&rdquo; The Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief started to urge the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;No, it-it&rsquo;s useless. That Demon Armament is too powerful, even the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman will not be able to restrict it. We are doomed today.&rdquo;<br><br>The Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had lost his head in fear, and actually started to back away from Chu Feng repeatedly. The desire to escape filled his heart.<br>He had also crumbled before the might of the Evil God Sword. He discovered that his previous confidence was merely self-deception.<br>When he felt the destructive power of the Evil God Sword again, he once again felt fear from the bottom of his heart.<br>At that moment, he felt that regardless of what sort of aura the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman might be emitting in his hand, it would still not be able to suppress Chu Feng&rsquo;s Demon Armament.<br>Thus, he felt that that day would likely become their doomsday. Chu Feng had once again brought upon them the disaster of their clan&rsquo;s elimination.<br>&ldquo;Give it to me.&rdquo;<br>The Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief directly grabbed the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman from the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s hand.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t you act arrogant. This Demon Armament Suppression Talisman specializes in subduing Demon Armaments.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if your Demon Armament possesses overwhelming power, you will still not be able to unleash it today. The power of your Demon Armament will be purified by this. You will become completely powerless.&rdquo;<br>After the Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said those words, he instilled his martial power into the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman. Then, the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman started to glow with golden light, The Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief also started to glow dazzling gold.<br>It was as if the Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had fused with the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman.<br>Once that golden radiance appeared, the crimson gaseous flames emitted by Chu Feng were immediately suppressed.<br>At that moment, the crimson gaseous flames that covered the sky earlier had completely disappeared. Only the Evil God Sword in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand was still emitting crimson gaseous flames.<br>Chu Feng shouted &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; in his heart. Holding the Evil God Sword, he was able to sense that the power of the Evil God Sword was being suppressed. He was simply unable to unleash the power of the Evil God Sword.<br>That so-called Demon Armament Suppression Talisman was actually really capable of suppressing the power of the Evil God Sword.<br>&ldquo;Trash, hand your body over to this god, this god will extinguish them for you.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly heard a voice. It was the Evil God Sword&rsquo;s voice.<br>&ldquo;You want me to hand my body to you? Never!!!&rdquo; Chu Feng refused.<br>He understood what the Evil God Sword meant. Right now, Chu Feng was only using the Evil God Sword. Thus, he was still in control.<br>As for the Evil God Sword, what it proposed was for it to gain control.<br><br>Chu Feng knew very well how frightening the killing intent the Evil God Sword possessed was. It was an existence filled with murderous desire. It was a true demon.<br>No matter how fierce and malicious the people of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm might be, they would simply pale into insignificance when compared with the Evil God Sword.<br><br>If he were to truly hand his body to the Evil God Sword, Chu Feng would likely become the embodiment of the Evil God. At that time, an enormous disaster would truly befall the people of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng was unable to be certain whether or not the Evil God Sword would really be able to resist the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman if he were to truly hand his body to the Evil God Sword.<br>What if the Evil God Sword was simply no match for it?<br><br>Or what if it was capable of withstanding the Demon Armament Suppression Talisman but refused to do so? What if those enticing words spoken by the Evil God Sword were merely its evil scheme?<br>Perhaps it never planned to help Chu Feng to begin with, and only wanted to use this opportunity to devour Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br><br>After all, legends had it that the previous masters of the Evil God Sword had all mysteriously disappeared.<br><br>Furthermore, according to the rumors, they were all devoured by the Evil God Sword.<br>Thus, Chu Feng was very cautious when it came to the Evil God Sword.<br><br></p></div>
