        <div>: The Real God Here<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After overcoming the marsh, Chu Feng and his group began on their journey of looting everything valuable in sight.<br>Thanks to Chu Feng&rsquo;s sharp eyes, he was able to see through any treasures hiding in the area and unearth them. However, he didn&rsquo;t monopolize the treasures but shared a portion with them with Xia Yan and Xiao Yu as well. Even though those two hardly contributed anything at all in the acquiring of the treasure, he still obeyed the rules of their alliance.<br>Xia Yan accepted everything that came his way, but Xiao Yu adamantly refused the treasures. It would appear that Xiao Yu only wanted the Illusory Palace Soulwater. As long as she could obtain it, she was willing to forgo everything else.<br>However, even as they traveled from location to location where the Illusory Palace Soulwater had been found previously, they weren&rsquo;t able to find it. Most of the treasures they found along the way were also not very useful to Chu Feng too, and very few of them were able to raise his spirit power.<br>Nevertheless, they could still be considered as treasures to other world spiritists.<br>&ldquo;Ah, finally something that interests me!&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, Chu Feng&rsquo;s face lit up in joy. He quickly led Xiao Yu and Xia Yan into a cavern and hurried ahead. In the end, they found themselves arriving in a place reminiscent of a huge hall.<br>At the deepest part of the hall was a towering stone platform, which contained a small spring. The water in the spring was glowing with seven different colors.<br>This springwater was similar to a cultivator&rsquo;s origin energy in terms of properties, but it was even more concentrated than that. In other words, this springwater was a cultivation resource that could raise one&rsquo;s spirit power.<br>It was just unfortunate that there was a formation in the spring that sealed it off. If they wanted to acquire the springwater, they would have to breach the formation first.<br>To make things worse, someone had gotten to the spring ahead of them. There were two men standing on the stone platform, by the side of the spring.<br>They were the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan.<br>Of the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan, Gongsun Yuntian had reached rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation, three of them had reached rank four, and the last three were at rank three.<br>The two who were in the hall had reached rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation. They had already constructed a formation and activated it, hoping to undo the formation to obtain the springwater.<br>&ldquo;Ah, what a coincidence,&rdquo; Xia Yan subconsciously muttered beneath his breath.<br>At the same time, the two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan also noticed the arrival of the trio, and they were a little surprised to see that they were traveling together.<br>&ldquo;It looks like the three of you have decided to join hands with one another?&rdquo;<br>After a short moment of assessing one another, one of the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan spoke in a mocking tone.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, we have joined hands with one another. Anything wrong about that?&rdquo; Xia Yan replied forcefully, showing no fear before the two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan at all.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your own choice, but I just find it hard to understand why you would work together with a trash like that.&rdquo;<br>When the prodigy of the Gongsun Clan said the word &lsquo;trash&rsquo;, he intentionally shot a glance at Chu Feng. Needless to say, the trash he was referring to was no other than Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s a trash, you would be trash amongst trash amongst trash amongst trash!&rdquo; Xia Yan bellowed back indignantly.<br>&ldquo;You dare to insult us? Are you seeking death? Don&rsquo;t think that we dare not to touch you just because you have grasped rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation!&rdquo;<br>One of the prodigies pointed a finger at Xia Yan and roared angrily.<br>Xia Yan wasn&rsquo;t intimidated by the threat at all. But before he could come up with a retort, Chu Feng suddenly patted on his shoulder before speaking to the two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t come here to make an enemy out of you. You need not carry such great enmity toward us.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng took out all of the treasures he had gathered thus far and floated them in front of him.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean by this?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that we&rsquo;re being unreasonable here. I&rsquo;ll trade all of the treasures I have here for the springwater,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Looks like you still know your place well.&rdquo;<br>One of the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan took away all of the treasures Chu Feng brought out with a swipe of his hand before keeping them into his Cosmos Sack. However, the two of them showed no signs of leaving after accepting the treasures. Instead, they continued driving the formation, attempting to retrieve the springwater.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t say anything upon seeing this, but his gaze slowly turned cold.<br>On the other hand, however, Xia Yan struck the limits of her patience first and roared, &ldquo;You have already accepted the treasure! Shouldn&rsquo;t you leave right now? The value of the treasure far surpasses that of the springwater!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan suddenly sneered.<br>&ldquo;The three of you interrupted us here. I&rsquo;ll treat those treasures as a gift that trash gave us in order to turn a blind eye to your disrespect. You should leave right now. Otherwise, if you continue incurring our displeasure, we won&rsquo;t hold back against you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heh, a bunch of trash hoping to compete with our Gongsun Clan? Look in the mirror and see whether you&rsquo;re qualified or not first!&rdquo;<br>The words of the two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan were incredibly jarring. Putting aside Xia Yan, even the reticent Xiao Yu showed embers of rage in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re courting death,&rdquo; Xiao Yu muttered.<br>He released a huge burst of spirit power right away toward the two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan. Xia Yan also quickly did the same as well.<br>Pah!<br>Pah!<br>However, barely after they released their spirit power, Chu Feng suddenly placed his hands on their shoulders and said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to trouble the two of you. Leave the likes of these small fries to me.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was intending to make a move himself, Xia Yan chuckled softly before obediently retracting his spirit power.<br>As for Xiao Yu, his first reaction was to shake Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand off his shoulder, but he also chose to retract his spirit power too.<br>&ldquo;What? Surely I&rsquo;m not hearing things, am I? A trash like you wants to challenge us?&rdquo;<br>The two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan had an incredulous look on their faces for a long time before they burst into frenzied laughter.<br>&ldquo;It looks like we really need to put your back in your place!&rdquo;<br>The two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan stopped the formation to retrieve the springwater and turned their attention to Chu Feng. The two of them quickly formed a series of hand seals.<br>&ldquo;Activate!!!&rdquo; they shouted in unison.<br>The ground began shaking violently, and surges of light rose from the ground and intersected with one another to form a massive formation. A massive beast towering at a height of tens of meters that resembled a lizard rose from the formation.<br>&ldquo;This is&hellip; the formation of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace?&rdquo; Xia Yan exclaimed in astonishment.<br>All it took was a single glance for her to notice the aura of the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace gathering around the massive formation beast.<br>This formation wasn&rsquo;t created by the two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan. Rather, the two of them had used some sort of mysterious means to take control of the energy here, allowing them to activate the formations of the palace.<br>&ldquo;Are you afraid now? The two of you are naive to think that you would be able to put up a match against us just because you&rsquo;re at rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation! Let me tell you, we have long taken control of the defensive formations here. In here, we&rsquo;re gods!&rdquo;<br>The two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan boasted gleefully.<br>Pfft!<br>However, before they could finish their words, Xia Yan first caved in and burst out laughing.<br>&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo;<br>The two prodigies didn&rsquo;t think that their grand revelation would be responded to by Xia Yan&rsquo;s laughter of ridicule. It made them feel incredibly displeased, but at the same time, they were also confused as to why he would respond this way too.<br>Awoo!<br>All of a sudden, the massive formation beast bellowed furiously as it raised its claws to swipe at the two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan. The massive formation beast had acted so quickly that the two prodigies were caught in its claws before they could even react.<br>Even though the massive formation beast had grasped hold of the two of them, it didn&rsquo;t hurt them. Despite so, its hands were still filled with have thorns that punctured their skin, leaving them with small holes all over. The excruciating pain left them hissing sharply.<br>They tried their best to struggle free from the grasp of the formation beast while attempting to gain control over it, but it was to no avail.<br>The bewildering circumstances filled with confusion.<br>&ldquo;It looks like the gods here aren&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; Xia Yan spoke mockingly<br>&ldquo;Bastard! Are you the one who did this?&rdquo;<br>The two prodigies glared at Xia Yan furiously.<br>It was then that the massive formation beast suddenly kneeled down, but the one it was kneeling to was neither Xia Yan nor Xiao Yu but Chu Feng.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng had already walked to the center of the hall, straight to the sealed spring. His hand passed right through the formation which the two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan were unable to breach previously and touched the springwater.<br>Following that, the springwater began gushing forth like a water dragon before finally entering the gourd Chu Feng was holding in his hand.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>This sight left the two prodigies of the Gongsun Clan dumbfounded.<br>It finally dawned on them who the one controlling the massive formation beast was.<br></p></div>
