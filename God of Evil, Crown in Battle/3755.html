        <h1>Chapter 3754</h1>
        <div> - The Unexpected<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing such a scene, the crowd all felt completely astonished.<br>Merely by using a treasure, Chu Feng was actually able to render the most powerful individual in the Ancestral Martial Starfield powerless.<br>The crowd all wanted to know where such a treasure came from. Thus, they all turned their gazes to Chu Feng.<br>It was not only the bystanders; even Chu Lingxi, Gu Mingyuan and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief all looked at Chu Feng with a longing expression in their eyes.<br>They also all wanted to know where such a treasure had come from.<br>In fact, it was not only the others that were astonished. Chu Feng himself was also completely astonished.<br>Although he had sensed how powerful that spirit formation was, he had not expected it to be so powerful.<br>An existence like Linghu Zhishi was actually so weak and small before his spirit formation.<br>This made Chu Feng recall the words spoken by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Perhaps the Ancestral Martial Starfield was truly extremely weak.<br>The Ancestral Martial Starfield was not only deemed trash by the other starfields in the Holy Light Galaxy, but it was also the trashiest of them all.<br>Otherwise, how could the strongest person in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield be unable to contend against a single treasure?<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, stop immediately! Otherwise, I will definitely eradicate your entire Chu Heavenly Clan!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, an ear-piercing roar exploded throughout the surroundings.<br>It was Linghu Zhishi&rsquo;s voice. Accompanying that roar was a boundless amount of ice-cold and piercing killing intent.<br>Furthermore, the gaze that Linghu Zhishi was looking at Chu Feng with at that moment was exceptionally terrifying.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clansmen were so scared that they did not dare to look Linghu Zhishi in the eyes. As for the bystanders, their hearts all tensed up with fear upon seeing his gaze.<br>However, the expression of Chu Feng, the person that that terrifying gaze was focused on, remained completely unchanged.<br>Chu Feng knew why Linghu Zhishi had suddenly acted in such a manner.<br>Linghu Zhishi had been forced to desperate straits because Linghu Hongfei was on the verge of being crushed to death by Chu Feng. Yet he, Linghu Zhishi, was completely powerless to do anything.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Linghu, those words of yours are quite dull and meaningless, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, you&rsquo;d never planned to spare my Chu Heavenly Clan to begin with.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rather than making such foolish claims, you should instead quickly think of a way to save Linghu Hongfei. Otherwise, he will really be crushed to death.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng turned his gaze to Linghu Hongfei.<br>Hearing those words, the crowd all subconsciously turned their gazes to him as well.<br>Even Linghu Zhishi was not an exception.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the crowd&rsquo;s gazes all landed on Linghu Hongfei, a muffled explosion was heard.<br>Following that muffled explosion, white light scattered in all directions, along with a large pile of crimson blood.<br>All of it had come from Linghu Hongfei.<br>At that moment, the crowd were all astonished. They simply did not dare to believe their eyes.<br>After all, that person was Linghu Hongfei, the strongest genius of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the future clan chief of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>Linghu Hongfei was killed just like that?!<br>The manner in which Linghu Hongfei had died was simply too humiliating.<br>He was crushed to death by the protective formation!<br>If Chu Feng had killed him with his own hands, Linghu Hongfei would&rsquo;ve enjoyed a much more honorable death than being crushed alive.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m going to kill you!!!&rdquo;<br>After a brief moment of silence, an incomparably furious roar exploded again.<br>After that roar was heard, the whole region started to tremble violently. Even space itself was shattered.<br>Everyone could sense Linghu Zhishi&rsquo;s current killing intent!!!<br>He was truly planning to unleash a massacre!!!<br>However, faced with Linghu Zhishi&rsquo;s threat, Chu Feng revealed a mocking smile.<br>He was smiling in the same manner as the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen had towards him earlier.<br>&ldquo;You want my life?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re powerless to even defend yourself.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice was heard, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed enormously.<br>Even Linghu Zhishi, the person emitting overflowing killing intent, was no exception.<br>At that moment, the crowd were able to see protective formations appearing around all of the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen. Even Linghu Zhishi was covered in a protective formation!!!<br>At that moment, endless panic began to spread through all the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>They had already realized how terrifying that protective formation was after they personally witnessed Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s death.<br>And at that moment, that same terrifying spirit formation had enveloped every one of them.<br>To them, that was no longer an ordinary spirit formation. Instead, it was a spirit formation that demanded their lives.<br>Linghu Hongfei would not be the only death. All of the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen would die!!!<br>At that moment, the crowd felt extremely complicated.<br>Originally, they&rsquo;d come to witness Chu Feng&rsquo;s death.<br>They were planning to witness Linghu Hongfei obtaining the title of the strongest person of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>They were planning to witness how tyrannical and powerful the Linghu Heavenly Clan, the new overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, was.<br>None of them had expected that instead of that, they would end up witnessing the death of Linghu Hongfei.<br>And now, they would be witnessing the extermination of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Crack~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Crack~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Crack~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What is that sound?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Isn&rsquo;t that?!!!&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the crowd felt that the Linghu Heavenly Clan would perish, cracking sounds began to be heard nonstop.<br>Looking toward the direction of the sounds, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed enormously.<br>Even Chu Feng was no exception.<br>They were astonished to discover that the powerful protective formation was shattering.<br>It was not only the protective formations around the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen that were shattering; even the ones around Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were shattering!!!<br></p></div>
