        <h1>Chapter 969</h1>
        <div> - An Attack akin to a Natural Disaster<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;ANCESTOR&mdash;&rdquo; The expression of the Immortal Execution Archipelago&rsquo;s members turned ashen. They were completely stupefied, unable to come back to their senses until a brief moment later, which they began to heart-wrenchingly lament.<br>Murong Mingtian was simply too important to them. In their hearts, he was akin to a god&mdash;one that led them and one that ruled over the world.<br>Yet now, their god was killed. How could they accept such an outcome? Like a believer who lost their faith, they lost a direction in life.<br>&ldquo;We will avenge Ancestor&mdash;&rdquo;<br>Amidst such devastating sorrow, the Immortal Execution Archipelago felt their rage and woe merge. They started pouncing towards the Crippling Night Demon Sect in a complete disregard for their own lives. They started trading deaths and paid no heed to what they did so long as they killed.<br>However, though power arose from their blend of emotions, the Crippling Night Demon Sect too rose in might after seeing Murong Mingtian&rsquo;s death. They weren&rsquo;t scared by the suicidal Immortal Execution Archipelago, and instead, they began even more ruthless slaughters.<br>In a situation like that, it was very difficult for the already suppressed Immortal Execution Archipelago and Three Great Monstrous Clans to hold on.<br>&ldquo;This feeling&hellip; Could it be&hellip;?&rdquo;<br>However, after Murong Mingtian&rsquo;s body exploded, there was a faint power that poured into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. However, Chu Feng frowned after it entered. A hint of suspicion flashed into his eyes.<br>*aoo&mdash;* In Chu Feng&rsquo;s moment of distraction, Jiang Qisha took that chance to cast his Mortal Taboo martial skill. He wanted to pass Chu Feng&rsquo;s White Tiger Slaughtering Technique and launch a sneak attack as well.<br>*boom&mdash;* However, he had greatly underestimated the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique. Even though Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t been focusing completely, the Secret Skill still had its own will. It once again broke Jiang Qisha&rsquo;s Mortal Taboo martial skill.<br>*aoo&mdash;* The white tiger then let out a furious roar, and leapt towards Jiang Qisha.<br>*whoosh* Jiang Qisha started quickly flying backwards in the air. He didn&rsquo;t choose to continue releasing Mortal Taboo martial skills to forcefully meet Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack. He instead chose to escape.<br>But the white tiger kept chasing tenaciously and it was very quick. Even though Jiang Qisha had used a bodily martial skill, the distance separating the two continued to gradually shrink.<br>&ldquo;Is this real? The genius who comes from the Holy Land of Martialism, and even defeated a Divine Body, is being forced to flee because of Chu Feng?&rdquo; The observers were exclaiming endlessly at such a sight.<br>If the act of killing Murong Mingtian made them acknowledge Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength, then the act of Jiang Qisha forced to flee in such a pitiful state by Chu Feng&rsquo;s Secret Skill made them approve of Chu Feng&rsquo;s abilities, as, after all, everyone knew Jiang Qisha was much more powerful than Murong Mingtian.<br>So even though Chu Feng had suppressed Jiang Qisha, many people still held in their hearts a sliver of hope. They felt the genius Jiang Qisha was unfathomable. There existed an infinite number of possibilities on him, so Chu Feng might not truly defeat him.<br>But many people&rsquo;s sliver of hope had started to break. The situation before their eyes did not make it appear that Jiang Qisha had a trump card to deal with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Hmph.&rdquo; But just when many people thought Jiang Qisha was defeated already, he coldly snorted as a hint of resolution surfaced in his eyes.<br>He then flipped his palm and several Talismanic Pellets appeared on his hand. He opened his mouth and swallowed them all.<br>*hmm*<br>After consuming the pellets, Jiang Qisha had the same reaction as Murong Mingtian: runes and patterns appeared on his skin and his aura soared.<br>*bang* Jiang Qisha suddenly turned around and punched the incoming White Tiger Slaughtering Technique.<br>*boom* That fist was not to be underestimated. It simply contained the power to destroy this land, and that punch alone blew apart Chu Feng&rsquo;s White Tiger Slaughtering Technique.<br>&ldquo;So powerful&mdash;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As expected of a genius from the Holy Land of Martialism. It seems that<br>this<br>is his real strength.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is too horrifying. Has he finally brought out his true abilities? It seems that Chu Feng&rsquo;s going to have something heading his way!&rdquo;<br>Many people deeply gasped at the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique dissipating in the air. At the same time, many people who wished for Chu Feng&rsquo;s death had an eased smile on their faces.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Jiang Qisha is this terrifying! How will Chu Feng stop him?&rdquo; As for those who wished Chu Feng to live, they couldn&rsquo;t help but worry about him.<br>Regardless how much power remained in the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique, it was still a powerful ability that could destroy Mortal Taboo martial skills.<br>Yet, at this moment, Jiang Qisha had broken through it with his fist. That illustrated Jiang Qisha&rsquo;s current strength. At least, his former self was not even comparable to him right now.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, the number of people who can force me to this state are countable by my fingers even within the Cursed Soil Sect.<br>&ldquo;I admit. I, Jiang Qisha, have underestimated you. I underestimated the strength that would come out of a bumpkin like you. However, it&rsquo;s time for this to end. I&rsquo;ll let you see what a true genius is! I&rsquo;ll let you see what a true technique is!&rdquo; Jiang Qisha sneered as he looked at Chu Feng, then his expression changed and he released an explosive shout.<br>&ldquo;DIE&mdash;&rdquo;<br>He struck with his fist, palm, foot, and leg, all at the same time. Four fierce bursts of Martial power rushed out from those four places.<br>The strength those four bursts of power contained was very fierce. Typical martial skills simply could not compare to them; it was even several times stronger than the Mortal Taboo martial skill Jiang Qisha used before.<br>He was now not only casting four martial skills at the same time, he was casting four different Mortal Taboo martial skills at the same time.<br>*boom*<br>Then, they merged together in the air, and became a body of energy that enveloped the sky.<br>The body of energy traveled through the air. It was like an enormous wave as it surged forward, yet also like a horrifying black mass of clouds. It not only had four different colours, it brought with it lightning and a storm. It was akin to an apocalypse that would destroy the world.<br>&ldquo;My gods! Jiang Qisha has actually cast such a terrifying technique! Is this still a martial skill? Is this still a technique of a human? This is simply more like the work of a god!&rdquo;<br>As they gazed upon the body of energy covering the entire sky and surging towards Chu Feng, everyone was stunned. Regardless if they wished for Chu Feng&rsquo;s death, they were dumbfounded by Jiang Qisha&rsquo;s move. This was most definitely the strongest technique they had seen up until now. It was simply a natural disaster that could destroy everything!<br></p></div>
