        <h1>Chapter 4317</h1>
        <div> - Like A False Display<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground was located in a continuous mountain range.<br>If one were to look down from above, one will be able to shockingly discover there was a mountain that resembled a dragon in the continuous mountain range.<br>It resembled a giant dragon coiling in the continuous mountain range.<br>But, that was not an artificially constructed mountain. Instead, it was formed naturally.<br>That was the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground.<br>&ldquo;This place is truly astonishing.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist were standing in the sky.<br>Even though they&rsquo;ve yet to enter the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground, Chu Feng could already sense the exception aura emitted by it.<br>Even though that Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground was clearly a mountain, it was emitting an intangible sort of oppressive might.<br>That was not the ordinary oppressive might that martial cultivators possess.<br>Instead, it resembled the innate oppressive might possessed by ferocious beasts.<br>It was a sort of &lsquo;natural&rsquo; oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all. Entering it is extremely difficult to do too,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist as Chu Feng gasped in admiration.<br>&ldquo;Master, is it really that difficult to enter it?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than difficult. If we are to rely on our own abilities, trying to enter it within a short period of time would be practically impossible.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man had also underestimated this Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Master, what are we supposed to do then?&rdquo;<br>While Chu Feng realized that it would be very difficult to enter the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground, he also realized from the tone of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s words that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist possessed a method to enter.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always a method. Since the two of us, master and disciple, will not be able to easily enter the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground with our own abilities, we&rsquo;ll have to seek out a way through the Dragon Clan itself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;<br>As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said those words, he brought Chu Feng along and left the forbidden area.<br>They began to proceed toward the location of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s upper echelons.<br>In the end, they&rsquo;ve arrived at an extravagant palace.<br>This extravagant palace was located above the clouds. Not only was it a dazzling sight, it resembled the residence of immortals as it was offset by the clouds.<br>While the palace was located above the clouds, it was very difficult to reach it.<br>This place was also a forbidden area within the Dragon Clan. Not to mention outsiders, even within the Dragon Clan, only those with a certain level of status will be able to enter this place.<br>As such, it was only natural for a place like that to be tightly guarded.<br>Yet, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist entered this place effortlessly.<br>Regardless of what sort of spirit formations were present, they were all akin to false displays before him.<br>It was so much that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had already effortlessly breached those spirit formations before Chu Feng could even discover them.<br>Following such an Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Chu Feng felt extremely safe.<br>After all, this place was the Dragon Clan of all places.<br>To be able to move about the Dragon Clan completely unhindered, one could tell how exceptionally powerful the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s world spirit techniques were.<br>Chu Feng even doubted if the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s world spirit techniques were really only at rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>&ldquo;Master, is this how powerful rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation is?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How come the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s numerous layers of protections are all useless toward you?&rdquo; Finally, Chu Feng voiced his curiosity.<br>&ldquo;Rank five Dragon Transformation is extremely powerful. Back then, your master managed to firmly stabilize my throne as the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s number one galaxy using that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, like martial cultivation, a world spiritist&rsquo;s ability at a certain level also depended on the individual.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your master&rsquo;s world spirit techniques are naturally not something that others could rival,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist immensely pleased.<br>&ldquo;How come I feel that master&rsquo;s world spirit techniques are not merely rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation?&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed a look of suspicion.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that this old man&rsquo;s world spirit techniques had truly reached a level surpassing that of ordinary people.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Else, you, my genius disciple of a world spiritist, wouldn&rsquo;t fail to realize what level my world spirit techniques are either.&rdquo;<br>The look of compliance on the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s face grew even more intense.<br>&ldquo;Master, are you really not lying to this disciple? Are you really rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Why would I lie to you? If I&rsquo;m not rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation, I would&rsquo;ve gone seek out that Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted to settle the debt already. Why would I bother to conceal my identity?&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. It would appear that master is truly a genius then,&rdquo; said Chu Feng with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Enough with the flattering. Wait for me here.&rdquo;<br>As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke, he raised one arm and a concealment formation landed on Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Master, are you not planning to allow me to accompany you?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of experts in there. It&rsquo;s better that you wait for me here. It&rsquo;s safer here,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Master, you&rsquo;re able to see who's inside?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng had attempted to examine the palace using his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>Unfortunately, the spirit formations around the palace hall were very ancient and powerful. Chu Feng was unable to see through them with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>But, from what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said, it seemed like he already knew what sort of people were inside that palace.<br>&ldquo;A guess.&rdquo;<br>Ox-nosed Old Daoist smiled. Then, he turned around and left.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist did not open the entrance to the palace hall. Instead, he passed through the walls.<br>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re still saying you can&rsquo;t see the insides?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng frowned. He felt that he was deceived.<br>Chu Feng was incapable of even seeing through the spirit formation on the palace. Yet, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist managed to effortlessly pass through it.<br>Chu Feng does not believe that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was unable to see through that spirit formation, unable to see the situation within the palace.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always had a feeling that this master of mine is even more remarkable than my imagination.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could this be the abilities of the world spiritist that was once the strongest in the Holy Light Galaxy?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng still felt the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s true strength was more powerful than his imagination.<br>Ignoring the fact that he was able to help him fuse with his Divine Power, merely the various abilities the Ox-nosed Old Daoist displayed today was enough to make Chu Feng gasp in amazement.<br>In fact, it could even be said that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist weren&rsquo;t actually unleashing a display of his abilities at all.<br>After all, the various layers of protective formations were all akin to false displays. The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had never bothered to put forth the effort to set up any real spirit formation to breach those protective formations.<br>It was because the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was simply too powerful that Chu Feng began to doubt whether or not he was hiding his true strength.<br>Even though the Ox-nosed Old Daoist explicitly told him that he was not concealing his strength, Chu Feng felt those words to not be very trustworthy.<br></p></div>
