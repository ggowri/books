        <div> - No Response<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are truly unable to differentiate good from bad. You are truly blinded with arrogance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that you think your world spirit techniques surpass my grandfather&rsquo;s?&rdquo;<br>Asura Zhao Kun said in a very displeased manner.<br>&ldquo;I am naturally inferior to Senior Zhao in terms of world spirit techniques. However, I possess my own viewpoint. I couldn&rsquo;t possibly just insist that what he says is absolutely true and deny my own viewpoint just because his world spirit techniques surpass my own, no?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Forget about it, there&rsquo;s no need to bother arguing with him,&rdquo; right at that moment, Liangqiu Hongyue spoke. She then turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, if you insist on throwing away your life, we will not be able to stop you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, this match must continue. Even if you decide to choose a different gate from us, the outcome of the battle must still be determined.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s simple, the person who opens their gate first shall be the victor,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Liangqiu Hongyue shook her head.<br>"Then how do you want to determine the victor?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"Since it's the Life and Death Gates, naturally the person who chooses the Life Gate shall be the victor. Thus, deciphering and unlocking the gates is not important. After all, it is very possible that the Life Gate will be much more difficult to decipher and unlock than the Death Gate," Liangqiu Hongyue said.<br>"How do you want to determine the victor then? Go ahead and tell me."<br>Chu Feng had a very indifferent appearance. It was as if he was able to accept any sort of condition Liangqiu Hongyue might present to him. The reason for that was because he was certain that he was going to win.<br>"Firstly, we must unlock the gates. Then, we must enter them. The one that returns alive shall be the victor,&rdquo; Liangqiu Hongyue said.<br>&ldquo;That girl is truly vicious. She is determined that the gate on the right is the Death Gate. Yet, she still insists on having you enter it. Isn&rsquo;t she simply trying to have you lose your life here?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said in a very angry manner.<br>Even though Her Lady Queen was no longer in Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, one could tell how furious she was from her tone.<br>However, Chu Feng was very indifferent to it. With a smile on his face, he said, &ldquo;Sure, we&rsquo;ll do as you say.&rdquo;<br>Originally, Chu Feng had wanted to urge the Liangqiu sisters to not enter the gate on the left. After all, Chu Feng was certain that it was the Death Gate. However, after seeing how vicious this Liangqiu Hongyue was, how she actually wanted him to die, Chu Feng found it unnecessary for him to urge her against entering the gate on the left.<br>As for that Liangqiu Lanyue, she was not confrontational toward Chu Feng like her younger sister. However, she also did not say anything about her younger sister&rsquo;s behavior. From this, it could be seen that Liangqiu Lanyue was the same as her younger sister. The two of them were jackals of the same tribe.<br>Thus, Chu Feng did not possess the slightest bit of sympathy should the two of them die. He would only think their deaths to be lamentable.<br>&ldquo;In that case, let us begin.&rdquo;<br>Then, Chu Feng and the Liangqiu sisters began to decipher their respective spinning wheels.<br>Truth be told, the gate that Chu Feng had chosen was very difficult to decipher and unlock.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that Chu Feng had managed to reach a breakthrough in his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, he would likely not be able to decipher the gate he had chosen.<br>However, his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes were no longer the same as before. Perhaps this was fate; a stroke of luck.<br>Chu Feng had just so happened to reach a breakthrough in his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes at a time like this. His breakthrough could simply be said to have occurred for the sake of deciphering and unlocking the Life Gate.<br>Even though Chu Feng took a great amount of time this time around, in the end, he managed to discover the corresponding unsealing formation to the Life Gate.<br>After Chu Feng discovered the unsealing formation, Chu Feng immediately started setting up the spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, that&rsquo;s the Death Gate. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t possibly be able to decipher it this quickly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Look at those two Liangqiu sisters, they have clearly not managed to decipher their gate yet. From this, it can be seen how difficult the spirit formation that they have encountered is.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had began setting up his unsealing formation, the Nine Profound Sect&rsquo;s disciples began to speak mockingly.<br>Right at that moment, Xia Yun&rsquo;er said, &ldquo;You all are also Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, are you all unable to tell whether or not the gate Chu Feng chose is difficult or not?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it is truly as simple as you all have said, how come you all are unable to find the deciphering method?&rdquo;<br>Hearing what Xia Yun&rsquo;er said, the two Nine Profound Sect&rsquo;s disciples who spoke earlier turned red.<br>They were only making cutting remarks toward Chu Feng. If they were to truly be tasked with deciphering the gate Chu Feng chose, they would really not be able to decipher it. After all, just by looking at it, they were able to tell that the puzzle of that spinning wheel was extremely difficult.<br>&ldquo;That spirit formation little friend Chu Feng is setting up is quite complicated.&rdquo;<br>Outside the Inheritance Cave, Elder Xingyi asked curiously, &ldquo;Brother Zhao, if that is really the Death Gate, would there be a need for such a complicated spirit formation to unlock it?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Are you questioning this old man?&rdquo; Zhao Kuangfengyi spoke in a somewhat displeased manner.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. I am merely very puzzled. Since it&rsquo;s the Death Gate, the unlocking method should be easier by comparison. It shouldn&rsquo;t be that difficult, no? That is why I wanted to consult with Brother Zhao why this was the case,&rdquo; Elder Xingyi said.<br>&ldquo;It is acting opposite of what is expected, that&rsquo;s all. There&rsquo;s nothing profound about it,&rdquo; Zhao Kuangfengyi said.<br>Hearing those words, Elder Xingyi smiled lightly. Even though he did not question Zhao Kuangfengyi again, he did not agree with his theory.<br>At the same time, the worry he felt for Chu Feng actually lessened greatly. Indistinctly, he felt that Chu Feng&rsquo;s choice might not necessarily be the wrong one.<br>Even though Chu Feng had managed to decipher the spinning wheel very quickly, he was setting up his spirit formation very slowly.<br>It was not that Chu Feng&rsquo;s technique was inferior. Rather, the spirit formation he was setting up was simply a bit difficult.<br>After Chu Feng continued setting up his spirit formation for an entire hour, the Liangqiu sisters finally managed to decipher the contents of their spinning wheel, and began to set up their spirit formation.<br>The speed at which they set up their spirit formation was very fast. By the time the two of them finished setting up their spirit formation, Chu Feng also finally finished setting up his spirit formation.<br>They activated their spirit formations simultaneously, and began to unlock the two gates.<br>&ldquo;Snap.&rdquo; &ldquo;Snap.&rdquo; At practically the same moment, the two gates opened.<br>After the two gates were opened, within them was a spirit formation. The spirit formations isolated everything inside. One would not be able to see the aura within the gates or see its contents. Thus, no one knew what one would be confronted with upon entering the gates.<br>&ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s enter,&rdquo; Liangqiu Hongyue said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Chu Feng had a smile on his face the entire time. As he spoke, he walked toward the gate he had opened.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you really certain that is the Life Gate?&rdquo; Right at that moment, a voice transmission entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>Looking toward the source of the voice, Xia Yun&rsquo;er, that exceptional beauty, was looking at him. A rare expression of worry was actually present in her eyes.<br>That poisonous beauty was actually worried about him.<br>Faced with Xia Yun&rsquo;er who was worried about him, Chu Feng smiled lightly. He said, &ldquo;You all merely need to wait for me. If there is no issue with this gate, you all can follow me in later.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng took a step forward and entered that gate.<br>After Chu Feng entered his gate, the Liangqiu sisters did not rush to enter their gate. Instead, they wanted to wait and see.<br>As for Xia Yun&rsquo;er, she was so worried that her heart was suspended in her throat. She was truly afraid that Chu Feng had chosen the wrong gate.<br>This was especially true after Chu Feng had been the gate for some time. The worry she felt for Chu Feng grew even more intense.<br>She didn't know why she was so worried about Chu Feng. Even her palms were sweaty.<br>Perhaps it was because she would lose the inheritance should Chu Feng fail. Or perhaps she truly did not want Chu Feng to die.<br>Regardless, as Chu Feng did not walk out of the gate even after being in there for so long, her heart gradually started to sink,<br>This most likely meant that Chu Feng had chosen the wrong gate.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that Chu Feng has been defeated. This is truly a pity,&rdquo; a Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s male disciple said sentimentally.<br>&ldquo;One cannot escape the evils brought forth by oneself,&rdquo; Liangqiu Hongyue sighed and shook her head. Then, she walked into the gate on the left. Liangqiu Lanyue followed closely behind her.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xia, you all have entrusted your hopes in the wrong person. You all actually believed in Chu Feng&rsquo;s choice. It would appear that it would be our Nine Profound Sect&rsquo;s victory this time around,&rdquo; the Nine Profound Sect&rsquo;s disciples said mockingly.<br>They all possessed joyous expressions on their faces. After all, this meant that they would obtain that Legacy Inheritance.<br>However, not long after, the smile on their faces froze. A while after that, not only had the smiles on their faces disappeared, but they even started to panic slightly.<br>It was not only them, even the elders outside the Inheritance Cave were like this.<br>The reason for that was because it was not only Chu Feng that gave no response after entering his chosen gate. Even the Liangqiu sisters gave no response after entering their chosen gate.<br><br><br></p></div>
