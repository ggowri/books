        <h1>Chapter 5102</h1>
        <div>: Song Changsheng&rsquo;s Identity<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Your Highness, are you certain?&rdquo;<br>Those from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan were delighted to hear that.<br>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao replied affirmatively.<br>Some of the elders from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan stepped forward to check Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s condition. Even Chu Feng did the same too. The results were the same. Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s terminal illness had indeed vanished without a trace.<br>Clearly, the person who treated her was Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s master.<br>Chu Feng was now more curious than ever who Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s master was. He looked toward the palace of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>The Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was initially in deep sleep, but he started showing signs of awakening as soon as Chu Feng glanced over. It seemed too much of a coincidence how things were perfectly lined up, and he had his own guesses as to what was going on.<br>So, Chu Feng left Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s sleeping chamber and headed for the palace of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Just as Chu Feng was about to arrive at his destination, someone suddenly rushed over and blocked his path. It was Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother.<br>She looked flustered. It seemed like there were many words at the tip of her tongue, but she dared not to voice them aloud. She didn&rsquo;t even dare to look straight into Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, elder?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t have much feeling for the members of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, but he still harbored a level of respect for Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother.<br>&ldquo;I know that it&rsquo;s wrong for me to do this, but he&rsquo;s still my older brother. I won&rsquo;t stop you from punishing him, but could you spare his life?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother spoke with a lowered head.<br>She felt embarrassed saying those words since the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief nearly took Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s life, but she was pleading on his behalf now.<br>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t blame Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother for making such a choice. It was impossible for her to choose between the two since they were both her kin.<br>&ldquo;Elder, Miaomiao told me that she doesn&rsquo;t intend to pursue this matter. Since she has already made her choice, I&rsquo;ll respect her decision,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Miaomiao said that she wouldn&rsquo;t pursue the matter?&rdquo;<br>Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s mother started tearing up. She was deeply conflicted as she was glad that her older brother was spared from death, but she felt that she had wronged her own daughter.<br>&ldquo;Elder, it&rsquo;s impossible to avoid conflicts in the world of cultivation, but not all conflicts need to end in bloodshed. You have to take care of yourself now that Miaomiao isn&rsquo;t by your side anymore,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He then walked up to the palace of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. The palace doors opened as he approached, revealing the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief standing behind.<br>The Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief looked at him with a conscience-stricken face and said, &ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, please come in.&rdquo;<br>He gestured toward the table, where there was a freshly brewed pot of tea.<br>&ldquo;It looks like you knew that I&rsquo;d be coming,&rdquo; Chu Feng asked as he walked into the palace.<br>The Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief closed the palace doors and erected a barrier before answering, &ldquo;That lord was here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is he the person you were referring to when you said that someone could save the Nine Souls Galaxy?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng already had such a guess when Xian Miaomiao told him to find out more from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, but he was now more confident of his guess.<br>&ldquo;Yes, he is indeed the person I was referring to,&rdquo; the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief replied with a nod.<br>&ldquo;Why did that lord visit you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;We are forbidden from speaking about that lord&rsquo;s affairs, so there&rsquo;s no one else in the Nine Souls Sacred Clan other than me who knows about him. However, that lord told me that he has taken Miaomiao in as his disciple and instructed me to tell you the truth if you approach me. This matter concerns not just the reputation of our Nine Souls Sacred Clan but that lord&rsquo;s too, so we don&rsquo;t speak of this matter lightly,&rdquo; the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;That lord saved Miaomiao, which makes him my benefactor. I&rsquo;ll keep his secret,&rdquo; Chu Feng said before finally taking a seat.<br>Seeing that, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief also took a seat too.<br>&ldquo;That lord&rsquo;s name is Song Changsheng, but he&rsquo;s the ancestor of our Nine Souls Sacred Clan,&rdquo; the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br>That revelation piqued Chu Feng&rsquo;s curiosity. A member of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan went by the surname of &lsquo;Song&rsquo;?<br>Through the explanation of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Chu Feng finally understood the history of that unfathomably powerful expert of the Nine Souls Galaxy.<br>The story had to start from two heroic figures in the Nine Souls Galaxy.<br>Back when Nine Souls Galaxy was still an era of chaos, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan wasn&rsquo;t the strongest power. It was only when they finally grasped control of the Soul Fog that they rose through the ranks and conquered the Nine Souls Galaxy.<br>For a period of time after that, they steadily grew stronger as their understanding of the Soul Fog deepened, allowing them to grow stronger and stronger. Eventually, they reached a new peak.<br>The person who discovered the Soul Fog and pushed the Nine Souls Sacred Clan toward unprecedented honor was none other than the Fourth Clan Chief of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. As the man who changed the fate of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, he was revered by all clan members.<br>He was the first heroic figure of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>However, when the Nine Souls Sacred Clan was at its peak, the Fourth Clan Chief suddenly led a group of experts out of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan and disappeared altogether. Shortly after the departure of the Fourth Clan Chief, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan found itself losing control over Soul Fog.<br>There used to be an endless supply of Soul Fog, but it suddenly started depleting till it vanished altogether.<br>The elders of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan weren&rsquo;t too affected by the disappearance of Soul Fog, but the juniors were no longer able to reach the same heights as their ancestors. It was when the Sixth Clan Chief passed away that the Nine Souls Sacred Clan finally faced a rapid decline in their strength.<br>The decline of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan stoked the ambitions of the other powers they were suppressing. Other powers from the other galaxies also had their eyes set on the Nine Souls Galaxy. The threats coming from both within and outside brought about a dark period for the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br></p></div>
