        <h1>Chapter 3148</h1>
        <div> - Dongguo Heavenly Clan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng had no idea what Qingyu Dong was thinking. He also had no heart to bother to guess what he was thinking.<br>Currently, Chu Feng was worried about the safety of Chu Qing and the others.<br>Chu Feng could not be certain that Chu Ping, Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu were not discovered by the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.<br>Fortunately, when Chu Feng arrived at the Immortal River, although the Immortal River had disappeared, Chu Ping, Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu were all here.<br>Furthermore, the four of them had all managed to gain quite a harvest from the undercurrent of the Immortal River. All four of them managed to gain a breakthrough in their cultivation.<br>From this, it could be seen that even though the Immortal River had only lasted for a short period of time, it had provided quite some assistance to them.<br>As it was all thanks to Chu Feng's discovery of the undercurrent, Chu Ping and Chu Qing were both very grateful toward Chu Feng.<br>Even Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu thanked him.<br>Regardless of whether their thanks were sincere or not, their attitudes were at least much better than before.<br>As for Chu Feng, he informed Chu Ping and the others of what Chu Shuangshuang had experienced, as well as what he did to Qingyu Fengming.<br>After all, what Chu Feng did could be akin to having completely antagonized the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan. As such, Chu Feng must have them prepare themselves mentally.<br>"I am truly sorry, I've caused trouble for everyone," Chu Feng said to Chu Ping.<br>"Little brother Chu Feng, please don't say it like that. There was originally no conflict between you and them. The only reason why you acted out against them was to save us. We should be the ones thanking you for it."<br>"Moreover, the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan has always been tyrannical and oppressive. Even if you did not teach them a lesson, they might not necessarily spare us either," Chu Ping immediately comforted Chu Feng.<br>"Little brother Chu Feng, what big brother Chu Ping said is correct. This is not your fault. You only acted that way because of us. Even if they are to truly come looking for trouble, we will fight them with you," Chu Qing said.<br>"As a man, one can bow and submit, or stand tall. Should we hide ourselves for the time being? After all, the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm is so large; we will definitely be able to find shelter here. It will not be too late for us to find them and settle the debt when our cultivation increases."<br>"After all, with Chu Feng's talent, they will soon not pose a threat to us anymore."<br>"Right, I feel like Chu Huanyu's suggestion is feasible."<br>Even Chu Huanyu and Chu Haoyan voiced their ideas.<br>Although they did not state that they would take responsibility with Chu Feng, they had made a proposal as to how to deal with the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.<br>Furthermore, from their tone, it seemed that they were completely confident in Chu Feng.<br>Actually, that was understandable too. After all, the two of them could be said to have personally witnessed Chu Feng's growth in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>The speed of Chu Feng's growth could be said to be miraculous, and was deeply engraved in their hearts.<br>"Actually, things are not as terrible as everyone thinks them to be. There might still be a leeway to turn things around. Merely, if we want to redeem the situation and protect the safety of our clansmen, we will likely have to have little brother Chu Feng act," Chu Ping suddenly said to Chu Feng.<br>Hearing Chu Ping saying it like that, Chu Qing and Chu Shuangshuang asked nearly simultaneously, "Leeway to turn things around?"<br>"Big brother Chu Ping, I can tell that you have something in mind. Why don't you tell us what it is?"<br>"The Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan is indeed capable of being considered a very strong power in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm's Eastern Region. However, they are not the strongest power in the Eastern Region. There are other powers present that are capable of contending against the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan."<br>"One of them is the Dongguo Heavenly Clan," Chu Ping said.<br>"Dongguo Heavenly Clan?"<br>Hearing those words, the expressions of Chu Shuangshuang, Chu Qing and the others all changed. They seemed to have recalled something.<br>"Little brothers, I believe you all already know that the Dongguo Heavenly Clan has had a friendly relationship with our Chu Heavenly Clan for many generations."<br>"Originally, the Dongguo Heavenly Clan and our Chu Heavenly Clan also had a close relation with one another in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. We used to share both honor and disgrace with one another."<br>"This is especially true for our generation. There are a great amount of talents within the Dongguo Heavenly Clan's younger generations."<br>"Whilst our Chu Heavenly Clan is in a very sorry state in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, their Dongguo Heavenly Clan has been doing extremely well, and is publicly accepted to be one of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm's Eastern Region's Three Great Powers."<br>"Originally, after being looked after by the Dongguo Heavenly Clan, although our Chu Heavenly Clan was weak, no one dared to bully us. In fact, it could even be said that our days here were extremely decent," Chu Ping said.<br>"In that case, why is the Dongguo Heavenly Clan not looking after us now? Could it be because our Chu Heavenly Clan has been unable to grow stronger for so long that they have begun to look down on us, and decided to abandon us?" Chu Haoyan asked.<br>There was a trace of displeasure in his tone as Chu Haoyan asked those questions.<br>It was not only him; Chu Huanyu's expression also turned very ugly.<br>Their reactions were understandable. After all, their two clans were originally close allies. Yet now, just because a party grew weak, they decided to abandon their ally. That was truly insincere.<br>"This matter really cannot be blamed on the Dongguo Heavenly Clan. The Dongguo Heavenly Clan originally treated our Chu Heavenly Clan very well. What happened was our Chu Heavenly Clan's fault," when Chu Ping mentioned this point, he had a very ashamed expression on his face.<br>"Big brother Chu Ping, exactly what happened?" Chu Feng asked.<br>Afterwards, Chu Ping began to inform Chu Feng of what had happened in full.<br>Originally, the Dongguo Heavenly Clan not only looked after the Chu Heavenly Clan in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, but they would even bring the Chu Heavenly Clan with them when they encountered cultivation opportunities.<br>Although the Dongguo Heavenly Clan did not share the benefits with the Chu Heavenly Clan equally, they could still be considered to have given the Chu Heavenly Clan an enormous share of the cultivation resources from those places where the Chu Heavenly Clan was simply incapable of entering by themselves. They could be said to have been extremely sincere and generous.<br>However, faced with such a sincere and generous Dongguo Heavenly Clan, the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan actually ended up doing an insincere thing.<br></p></div>
