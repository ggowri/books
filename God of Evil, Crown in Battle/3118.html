        <h1>Chapter 3117</h1>
        <div> - Entering The Cultivation Realm<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;The two of you, listen carefully. The grudges and grievances between the previous generations are unrelated to you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are all people of the same clan. As such, you should all unite and help one another, and absolutely not kill one another.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you will be entering the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, you must all let go of the grudges in your heart, and unite against our external enemies.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If anyone dares to cause internal strife, it will be equivalent to betraying our clan. As for that, it is a serious crime.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if you all are able to hide in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, this old man will make you all suffer miserable lives upon your return,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief threatened Chu Haoyan and Chu Chu Huanyu with a stern voice.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, please quell your anger. This junior understands,&rdquo; with the situation being like that, how could Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu dare resist? The two of them both expressed their desire to comply with the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s orders.<br>The reason for that was because they were able to tell that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was not joking around. He was serious. If they dared to do anything to Chu Feng in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm and were to be discovered by their Lord Clan Chief, they would truly end up suffering.<br>This was already obvious from the treatment of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief toward Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather and Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather.<br>&ldquo;Shuangshuang, Chu Qing, as elders, the two of you should look after the three of them, understand?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief looked to Chu Shuangshuang and Chu Qing.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, please rest assured,&rdquo; Chu Shuangshuang and Chu Qing both clasped their fists respectfully.<br>&ldquo;Well then, you all can go in.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There is no need to stay too long after entering. As long as you all feel like you&rsquo;ve received enough assistance from that place, you can come back out,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>Then, he handled the five bubble-like Cultivation Keys to Chu Feng and the others.<br>Chu Feng and the others did not hesitate. They directly pinched the Cultivation Keys they were given.<br>When the bubbles shattered, they immediately turned into a powerful surge of spirit energy that enveloped Chu Feng and the others.<br>The next moment, Chu Feng felt his surroundings moving at a rapid pace. He felt as if his head was spinning.<br>This lasted for an hour before stopping.<br>The power that had surrounded Chu Feng entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead. The place that Chu Feng was in was no longer the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, no longer inside the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s palace.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was in a completely new world.<br>He was above a mountain range. Below him was a formation. It was as if it was that formation had summoned him.<br>Furthermore, Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu and Chu Shuangshuang had also appeared beside Chu Feng.<br>In fact, even the positions that they were standing in were the same as when they were inside the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s palace hall.<br>Chu Feng knew that they had arrived in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve actually arrived so quickly? The power of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s formation is truly extraordinary,&rdquo; at that moment, even Chu Qing exclaimed in admiration.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, the power of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm is truly extraordinary,&rdquo; Chu Shuangshuang also smiled. Then, she said to Chu Feng and the others, &ldquo;Little brothers, I believe you all have sensed it too, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Cultivation Keys are not only capable of bringing us here, they are also capable of bringing us away from here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The power of that formation has entered our souls through our foreheads. As long as we will it so, we will be able to leave this place at any time. However, remember this: as long as we activate that power and leave this place, we will never be able to set foot in here again. Even if we are to obtain another Cultivation Key in three years&rsquo; time, we will still not be able to return.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We got it. Thank you for your reminder, big sis Shuangshuang,&rdquo; Chu Feng and the others clasped their fist respectfully.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I should do. We are all family, there&rsquo;s no need to be this courteous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Cultivation Keys have predetermined teleportation destinations. All the people in our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm that use the Cultivation Key will all be teleported to the same place. Thus, our Chu Heavenly Clansmen should be in the vicinity,&rdquo; Chu Shuangshuang said.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re over there,&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed to the southwest.<br>Through his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to see a vast group of palaces located to the southwest. On the tallest tower over there was a banner fluttering in the wind.<br>On the banner were the large words &lsquo;Chu Heavenly Clan.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well. In that case, let us proceed in that direction,&rdquo; as Chu Shuangshuang spoke, she soared into the sky and began flying southwestward.<br>Chu Feng and the others also soared into the sky and began flying after her.<br>&ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t there even a single formation around?&rdquo; Upon approaching, Chu Feng started to frown.<br>According to their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm was a very dangerous place.<br>Logically, even if it was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s headquarters, they would still be in danger of being invaded by other clans.<br>Thus, their territory should be protected by defensive formations.<br>However, after approaching the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory, Chu Feng discovered that there were no defensive formations at all.<br>Soon after, Chu Feng was no longer only surprised, but he even began feeling a bit disappointed.<br>They had already entered the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s headquarters. However, no one actually discovered them. The observational ability of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen training in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm was simply too lacking.<br>With the situation being like that, Chu Feng decided to spread his spirit power to inspect the region.<br>Under Chu Feng&rsquo;s inspection, the cultivations of all the Chu Heavenly Clansmen inside the headquarters was revealed to him.<br>Upon sensing those people&rsquo;s cultivations, Chu Feng started feeling even more disappointed.<br>Chu Feng came to realize why their Chu Heavenly Clan would have such a low status in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br></p></div>
