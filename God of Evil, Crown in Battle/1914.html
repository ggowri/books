        <div> - The Weakening Of The Spirit Formation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>After entering the Blood Devouring Killing Formation, Chu Feng was deeply shocked. Although the Blood Devouring Killing Formation seemed to be filled with mist when looking at it from the outside, the mist all disappeared the moment they entered it.<br>However, the ground, the mountain and even the rocks all became red. Looking high above, even the sky was red. The entire place was crimson red. It was truly dazzling to the eyes.<br>&ldquo;Blood Devouring Killing Formation, its reputation is well deserved,&rdquo; When Xian Miaomiao saw this scene, not only was she not afraid, she even looked extremely excited. She was running around as if he was enjoying a tour.<br>&ldquo;Haha, that girl is quite to this Queen&rsquo;s liking,&rdquo; Seeing Xian Miaomiao acting in such a manner, not only was Her Lady Queen not annoyed, she instead revealed a rare gaze of appreciation.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call her &lsquo;girl&rsquo; all the time. It&rsquo;s makes you sound like you&rsquo;re way older than her,&rdquo; Chu Feng snickered. Even though Chu Feng had already become a man after all these years, Her Lady Queen still possessed the appearance of a young girl.<br>Regardless of what sort of temperament she possessed, regardless of how ruthless she was in handling things, her young and tender face was still as perfect as before. It still gave off a sense of harmlessness. Even though Chu Feng had now seen her face for many years, he still deeply enjoyed it.<br>Her Lady Queen narrowed her eyes and feigned a sinister appearance as she said, &ldquo;If this Queen were to mention her age, you would be scared to death.&rdquo;<br>However, when those crescent shaped eyes of hers were placed on her beautiful face, no matter how one looked at it, one would feel that she was extremely adorable and be charmed by her beauty.<br>&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes, Milady Queen is the most amazing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Milady Queen, would you like to come out and enjoy this beautiful crimson scenery while holding hands with me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Pah! Who would want to hold hands with you? Go and walk around by yourself. This Queen will go to sleep,&rdquo; After Her Lady Queen said those words, she went silent.<br>Although Chu Feng felt a bit disappointed that Her Lady Queen had decided to not talk to him anymore, he did not feel lonely. Afterall, beside him was Xian Miaomiao. That girl&rsquo;s mouth was talking nonstop.<br>Xian Miaomiao looked to her surroundings. Then, with a curious expression, she asked Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, say, why would this place be this red? Did the person that set up this spirit formation do so deliberately to scare others?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Scare others?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Feng started to smile. Then, he said, &ldquo;The red color of this place is all caused by blood; this entire place was dyed red by blood.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who are you trying to deceive? If there&rsquo;s all this blood, how come there&rsquo;s no reeking smell of blood? Furthermore, blood will turn black after it dries. How could this place still remain this brightly red? Do you think that just because I am inexperienced you&rsquo;d be able to deceive me,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao said with a disdainful expression.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why this place is amazing. The blood here does not dry out, nor does it reek of the smell of blood. Instead, it was all sealed in this place. If you do not trust me, I can let you have a look.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he began to set up a spirit formation on the spot. He managed to set up a spirit formation the size of a fingernail. He placed the spirit formation onto a piece of rock and shouted, &lsquo;Open!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chii~~~:<br>In an instant, that spirit formation turned into a fountain&rsquo;s mouth, and blood began to spray out of it. Furthermore, there was so much blood spraying out of it that it looked like a pillar.<br>After that spirit formation stopped spraying blood, the piece of rock that Chu Feng had placed his spirit formation on actually returned to its appearance of a normal rock. Merely, the ground which had been sprayed with blood turned an even brighter red. The reason for that was because the blood that had sprayed out of the rock had all been soaked into the ground.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, it&rsquo;s actually real,&rdquo; After discovering that all the things in this place were dyed red with blood, Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s expression changed. She was not scared. Rather, she was extremely shocked.<br>Unable to contain herself, Xian Miaomiao asked, &ldquo;How many people have died here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A lot. Not only humans, but also monstrous beasts and even existences other than humans and monstrous beasts,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao asked.<br>&ldquo;I am able to tell with my eyes. Although the blood is all red, I can tell that there are essential differences in the nature of the blood.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For some of the blood, I can see how powerful their owners were using merely my eyes. They were existences that transcended Martial Emperors,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Above Martial Emperors are Half Martial Ancestors. Could it be that there were Half Martial Ancestor experts in this place?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao asked in a shocked manner.<br>&ldquo;Half Martial Ancestor?&rdquo; Chu Feng naturally knew about Half Martial Ancestors. It was a realm of cultivation above Martial Emperors. Above Half Martial Ancestors were Martial Ancestors, existences even more powerful than them. Reportedly, Martial Ancestors were the limit that a human could reach with their mortal body. Upon becoming a Martial Ancestor, their flesh would become unimaginably tough.<br>Martial Ancestor was an extremely distant realm. It was said that people in the Holy Land of Martialism were unable to go farther than Half Martial Ancestor.<br>However, the blood here indeed surpassed that of Martial Emperors. Perhaps it was the blood of Half Martial Ancestors. However, Chu Feng was unable to be certain of it.<br>However, what he was capable of being certain of was that there were indeed experts that surpassed Martial Emperors that had died here.<br>Merely, he was unable to determine the time of their death. The reason for that was because the blood sealed within this place was all kept totally fresh.<br>Right at that moment, Her Lady Queen suddenly spoke. &ldquo;The power of this spirit formation has weakened. It has weakened enormously. Otherwise, with the cultivations that the two of you possess, it would simply be impossible for you to be able to intrude into this spirit formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eggy, how do you know that?&rdquo; Chu Feng was astonished. Although his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes were extremely powerful, he was still unable to see the phenomenon that Her Lady Queen mentioned.<br>&ldquo;If this spirit formation was not more powerful before, how could so many experts have died in here?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, the sealing formation of this place is also very remarkable. Although you are capable of extracting the blood sealed within this place, you are unable to take it away with you. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded. What Eggy said was the truth. While he was capable of using his own spirit formations to extract the sealed blood, he was unable to use his own spirit formations to bring away the sealed blood. The reason for that was because the blood in this region belonged to the Blood Devouring Killing Formation. As for the Blood Devouring Killing Formation, it was a spirit formation that greatly surpassed the spirit formations that Chu Feng was capable of setting up. Thus, he would naturally not be able to bring the blood away from it.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, what sort of existence do you think set up this spirit formation? Could it be an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say. As this spirit formation has weakened to this extent, I am unable to ascertain the strength of its creator,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen shook her head.<br>Right at that moment, Xian Miaomiao suddenly asked with a beaming smile on her face, &ldquo;Chu Feng, Chu Feng, do you know about the matters concerning this Blood Devouring Killing formation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I know a bit. I&rsquo;ve heard that this Blood Devouring Killing Formation originated from the Ancient Era. Furthermore, hidden within it are treasures from the Ancient Era.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For the sake of those Ancient Era&rsquo;s treasures, after the Ancient Era passed, countless experts attempted to charge into this place. However, none of them managed to return. Furthermore, it is said that the traps and mechanisms of this place are extremely frightening. If one is to trigger them, one&rsquo;s body will explode, and they will die. That is why this spirit formation is called the Blood Devouring Killing Formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;All that you&rsquo;ve said is only general knowledge. Do you know anything else?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao asked.<br>&ldquo;I do not. Could it be that you do?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao raised her head up high. Then, in a complacent manner, she said, &ldquo;Let me tell you, the Blood Devouring Killing Formation used to be the number one Forbidden Area in the Holy Land of Martialism. Even the Realm of Gods and the Moonlight Maze were inferior to it. At that time, no one dared to enter the Blood Devouring Killing Formation. The reason for that was because this place was truly a place that one could enter but not leave.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, with the passage of time, the power of the Blood Devouring Killing Formation has gradually weakened. As matters stand, not to mention the surroundings, even the most frightening region of the Blood Devouring Killing Formation can be entered as long as we are wearing the Blood Devouring Armors. Think about it, how much has the power of this place weakened?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao said.<br>&ldquo;It seems that Her Lady Queen was correct,&rdquo; Chu Feng became certain of Eggy&rsquo;s opinion. The reason for that was because what Xian Miaomiao had just said had verified Eggy&rsquo;s opinion.<br></p></div>
