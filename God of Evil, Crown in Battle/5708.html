        <h1>Chapter 5708: The Mansion Master’s Preparations</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Chu Feng left, the woman with divine eyes appeared with the brush. This time, the brush appeared in the form of a girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master, I sense a peculiar aura from the imprint on Chu Feng&rsquo;s robe,&rdquo; the girl said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a god beast,&rdquo; the woman with divine eyes replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;A god beast?&rdquo; The girl was astonished to hear that. &ldquo;Why would Chu Feng have a god beast? Is he being exploited or possessed?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The power of the god beast has been suppressed. It was probably forced to follow Chu Feng.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;God beasts are incredibly proud, and they look down on humans. They would never submit to a human unless the human is stronger than them. Chu Feng is talented, but he hasn&rsquo;t unleashed his potential yet. Could the god beast be plotting something?&rdquo; the girl asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of our business. It&rsquo;s for Chu Feng to deal with,&rdquo; the woman with divine eyes replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her words, her eyes remained focused on the Constellation Gate. She was extremely curious to know why the god beast was following Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Traveling via the Nine Heavens Secret Domain&rsquo;s Constellation Gate, it didn&rsquo;t take </span><span>Chu Feng long to arrive at the Totem Galaxy. As soon as he stepped out from the teleportation formation, he heard two pieces of news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was regarding the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was surprised to learn that he had been invited since his cultivation was still limited even though he had caused a huge fuss in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. He was also taken aback when he learned about Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> and Wang Qiang&rsquo;s invitation too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no doubt the Nine Souls Galaxy&rsquo;s Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> was the one he knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the Divine Body Galaxy&rsquo;s Wang Qiang, he wondered if it was really his brother Wang Qiang or someone with the same name. He knew that his brother possessed the Four Fiends Divine Body, which was the tenth strongest Divine Body, and coupled with his talent for cultivation, it was possible for the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion to take him in as long as it valued talents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, it was just a conjecture at this point, though he hoped that it was indeed Wang Qiang. He was rather worried about the latter&rsquo;s safety due to the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the whole, he didn&rsquo;t bear too much hope about it since it was likelier that it was just someone with the same name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, he was more worried about Long Chengyu and Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span>, as he had already confirmed that a rebellion had broken out in the Totem Dragon Clan, leading to the overthrow of the previous clan chief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something bad might have happened to Long Chengyu and the others in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oblivious to Chu Feng&rsquo;s ties with the Totem Dragon Clan, the Heaven-devouring </span><span>Qilin</span><span> said, &ldquo;Little Feng, why are you so nosey? Let&rsquo;s not waste time on useless matters and get going.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You sensed something?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course. It&rsquo;s in the southeast,&rdquo; the Heaven-devouring </span><span>Qilin</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That happened to be where the Totem Dragon Clan was. It just so happened that Chu Feng wanted to find out what happened to Long Chengyu and the others, so he made his way over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Saint-tier elder responsible for guarding the saint beast&rsquo;s egg returned to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion together with the other elders and reported the matter to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master didn&rsquo;t punish them for that matter, for he knew that they were bound to be helpless before the World Spiritist Immortal King&rsquo;s formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he dismissed the elders and sat alone inside his palace with a livid expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought that Chu Feng was dead, but the latter was still alive and even ruined the saint beast&rsquo;s egg they had incubated for thirty thousand years. How could he not be infuriated?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never had the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion faced such humiliation ever since he took charge, and to make things worse, the person who inflicted such humiliation on them was someone whom he looked down on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, the palace door opened, and two figures entered. One of them was </span><span>Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span>, and the other was the world spiritist named Beast Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master had summoned them over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Mansion Master.&rdquo; The two of them bowed respectfully to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span>, is there something wrong with your nose?&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Mansion Master, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with my nose,&rdquo; Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span> replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Nothing wrong? Chu Feng is alive!&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master roared in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive?&rdquo; Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span> quickly grasped what was going on, so he formed a hand seal and sniffed around. Soon, his face stiffened up, and he murmured, &ldquo;He really is alive!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you know where he is?&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Mansion Master, he&rsquo;s in the Totem Galaxy.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is he on his way to the Totem Galaxy?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s already in the Totem Galaxy.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span>, there must be something wrong with your nose.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Mansion Master, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with my nose. I must have missed Chu Feng&rsquo;s scent because he was on the verge back then, but who could have thought that he would be so lucky as to survive the ordeal? I can smell his scent now, and he&rsquo;s indeed still alive.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I also know that he&rsquo;s alive, or else I wouldn&rsquo;t have called you here. But there&rsquo;s no way he could be in the Totem Galaxy. Check again,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on the Saint-tier elder&rsquo;s report, Chu Feng should still be in the Seven Realms Galaxy. There was no way he could have reached the Totem Galaxy so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span> gave it another try. He sniffed for four whole hours, and the sweat dripping from his head showed that he had exerted quite a bit of energy. However, he dared not to report his conclusion to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Speak! Where is he?&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span> wiped his sweat before replying, &ldquo;Lord Mansion Master, he r-r-really is in the Totem Galaxy. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Impossible. There&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;s in the Totem Galaxy,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span> was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span>, you don&rsquo;t want that item anymore?&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I do, Lord Mansion Master, but I am not lying. Chu Feng is in the Totem Galaxy at the moment. If I may ask, how are you certain that he&rsquo;s not in the Totem Galaxy? Do you have news on him?&rdquo; Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master thought about it, but he decided not to tell Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span> about the saint beast&rsquo;s egg. Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span> was an outsider, after all. It would further sully the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s reputation if others learned that Chu Feng had ruined the saint beast&rsquo;s egg they had been incubating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span>, I don&rsquo;t care if your nose is working properly, but this is your final chance. Capture Chu Feng alive. It&rsquo;ll do as long as there&rsquo;s a breath left in him. I&rsquo;ll give you what you want in return.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master decided to trust Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span> this time, knowing how the latter had never failed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Rest assured, Lord Mansion Master. I&rsquo;ll bring Chu Feng before you,&rdquo; Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span> said confidently. He was confident in his judgment that Chu Feng was in the Totem Galaxy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Beast Shadow, you tag along,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; Beast Shadow replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span> and Beast Shadow made their way to the Totem Galaxy, whereas the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master made his way toward one of their forbidden lands. He had more important matters to attend to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had hesitated for quite a while, but he decided to prioritize Jie Tian and personally construct a formation for the latter&rsquo;s trip to the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith. In his view, Jie Tian was the future of their Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, and the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith was an ideal opportunity to build his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held onto the view that Chu Feng was a small fry even though the latter had performed many astonishing feats. He believed that Daoist </span><span>Heavensniffer</span><span> and Beast Shadow would be enough to deal with Chu Feng.</span></p></div>
