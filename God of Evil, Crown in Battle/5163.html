        <div>: The Origin Energies of God-cloak<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shoosh!<br>With a wave of his sleeves, Chu Feng sent a flood of martial power toward the civilians of the ancient city. As soon as they came into contact with the martial power, they let out a pained cry before passing out.<br>Gah!<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t actually hurting them. Rather, he was using his martial power to erase their memories so that they would forget Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance and everything that had just happened. Otherwise, if someone divulged today&rsquo;s events, the Situ World Spiritist Clan would immediately retaliate against him.<br>After all was done, Chu Feng continued treating Song Yuwei. He managed to preserve Song Yuwei&rsquo;s cultivation, but she was simply too severely injured that she fell into a coma in the midst of treatment. It was unlikely that she would wake up anytime soon.<br>Chu Feng frowned at Song Yuwei&rsquo;s condition.<br>It might seem like she had already recovered from her injuries at first glance, but her soul was still in tatters. Unfortunately, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t confident of properly treating her.<br>The recovery formation he had constructed around Song Yuwei was already the most potent one he had. If this wasn&rsquo;t enough to treat Song Yuwei&rsquo;s soul either, there would be nothing he could do to help her. In other words, this was the crucial phase.<br>While waiting for the results of the treatment, Chu Feng walked up to City Lord Liang and said, &ldquo;My apologies, City Lord Liang. We have implicated you.&rdquo;<br>It was his desire to go after the Situ World Spiritist Clan that led to this chain of events. While he had saved City Lord Liang, the latter wouldn&rsquo;t be able to remain here anymore. Situ Tingye would surely turn his eyes toward City Lord Liang once he realized that the nine thousand Situ World Spiritist Clansmen dispatched here had gone missing.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, please don&rsquo;t say that. The vile ones are the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen. You have done no wrong. If not for your intervention, my family and I would have surely died here. I should be thanking you instead.&rdquo;<br>City Lord Liang kneeled down to Chu Feng to express his gratitude.<br>Those weren&rsquo;t just empty words. He was already prepared to die earlier, and he was deeply grateful to have been able to receive a second chance at life.<br>&ldquo;City Lord Liang, please don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng hurriedly helped City Lord Liang back to his feet. He already felt conscience-stricken for landing City Lord Liang in his current plight, so how could he receive such a formality from the latter?<br>&ldquo;This feeling?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng suddenly sensed the rank four Half-God level cultivation he had been imbued with had vanished without a trace. Mysteriously, his connection with the Asura King and those from the Asura World Spirit Army had disappeared too. It was almost as if they were gone from his World Spirit Space.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, come in and take a look!&rdquo; Yu Sha exclaimed in a panic.<br>Chu Feng quickly excused himself before projecting his consciousness into his World Spirit Space. There, he found that the gate leading into where the Asura King and the Asura World Spirit Army resided had completely closed off.<br>Without a doubt, the gate was the cause behind the sudden severance of connection.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, this gate suddenly closed on its own accord. Are you able to open it?&rdquo; Yu Sha asked.<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. My connection with the Asura World Spirit Army has also been severed too. This door is completely isolating me away from them,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Why would this happen?&rdquo;<br>Yu Sha understood the severity of the matter.<br>Chu Feng was only able to deal with the experts of the Situ World Spiritist Clan with the power of the Asura World Spirit Army. Now that their connection had been severed, he would no longer be able to obtain their help anymore.<br>In his current state, Chu Feng was no match for the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>&ldquo;It must be the image. I&rsquo;ve underestimated it,&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured.<br>The image had finally revealed its full form. It floated at the center of the gate, reminiscent of a lock.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that the appearance of the image would actually cause the gate to close up. He was still planning on unraveling its secrets once it fully revealed itself.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, can the image be deciphered?&rdquo; Yu Sha asked.<br>&ldquo;It should be possible. I can sense a secret hidden inside the image, but it won&rsquo;t be easy for me to figure out what it is. It should be safe to say that the image is the cause behind the gate&rsquo;s closing. The key to unlocking the gate should be hidden in the image,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Why would this happen?&rdquo; Yu Sha asked in confusion.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking that this might be an effect of God&rsquo;s Contract, possibly a trial from the Emperor of Massacre. It might be possible that there&rsquo;s a limit as to how many times I can use the power of the Asura World Spirit Army. Each time I use it, the image will show more of itself. By the time the image is fully revealed, the gate will automatically close up. To unlock the gate, I&rsquo;d have to prove myself worthy by deciphering the secrets behind the image,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;That does seem to be the case.&rdquo;<br>Yu Sha thought that Chu Feng&rsquo;s deduction sounded logical.<br>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Since it&rsquo;s a trial, all I have to do is to clear it. If I can&rsquo;t, it just means that I&rsquo;m unqualified to tap into the Asura World Spirit Army&rsquo;s power.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t worried. He knew that the seal was only temporary. As long as he obtained enough power, he would be able to remove the seal and regain the powers of the Asura World Spirit Army.<br>&ldquo;Really, why does the Emperor of Massacre have to create such a trial? Furthermore, why does this have to happen at this crucial juncture&hellip;&rdquo; Yu Sha grumbled.<br>Chu Feng was in dire need of the Asura World Spirit Army&rsquo;s power at the moment. Losing their help right now was the worst thing that could happen.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Yu Sha. It&rsquo;s my fortune to have received the help of the Asura World Spirit Army, but I can&rsquo;t possibly keep relying on them for everything. Ultimately, I have to grow stronger too. Since I can&rsquo;t rely on them at the moment, I&rsquo;ll just have to rely on myself,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>With a thought, he manifested a bundle of energies inside his World Spirit Space.<br>&ldquo;Are those the origin energies you have sapped from them?&rdquo;<br>Yu Sha&rsquo;s eyes lit up. As a world spirit, there was nothing she looked forward to more than origin energies. Not to mention, the origin energies Chu Feng had taken out came from the nine thousand elite world spiritists from the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>There were even ten White Dragon God-cloak and two Gray Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists amongst them. If she could consume all of it, her cultivation would surely advance by leaps and bounds.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s half of it. I&rsquo;m planning to keep the other half for Eggy,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>Had he followed his own selfish heart, he would have kept all of it for Eggy. There was no one in this world who could replace Eggy&rsquo;s position in his heart. However, he couldn&rsquo;t mistreat Yu Sha, not when the latter was now following him. The best way to deal with this situation was to split things equally.<br>&ldquo;There are so many origin energies here, and it&rsquo;s only half of it? It looks like God-cloak World Spiritists are really not to be looked down on. Their origin energies are incredible!&rdquo; Yu Sha exclaimed in a rare show of excitement.<br></p></div>
