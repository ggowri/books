        <h1>Chapter 3156</h1>
        <div> - Become The Ruler<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Chu Feng returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan's territory, he discovered that the vast group of palaces has been razed to the ground.<br>Their ruins covered the ground. It was a complete mess.<br>As for the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, they were gathered in the destroyed main palace.<br>They were all tied up by special ropes. The ropes were emitting flames and burning their bodies all over, causing them to scream repeatedly.<br>However, Chu Feng noticed that Chu Ping, Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan, Chu Huanyu and Chu Shuangshuang were not among the people that were tied up.<br>Upon landing, Chu Feng immediately removed the flame ropes from those Chu Heavenly Clansmen and began to treat their injuries.<br>"Was this done by the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen?" Chu Feng asked them after treating their injuries.<br>"You have the nerve to ask us that?! If it wasn't the Burnfield Monstrous Clan, who else could it be?!" After standing up, Chu Hongyi pointed at Chu Feng and shouted angrily.<br>His words verified Chu Feng's guesses.<br>"Where is big sis Shuangshuang and the others? Were they captured by the Burnfield Monstrous Clan?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"Of course they were captured. It's because they were so close to you that they ended up being captured. Right now, their life and death is unknown. Even if they're alive, they&rsquo;ve likely already been tortured insane."<br>"Chu Feng, you are truly a bringer of bad luck. Originally, our Chu Heavenly Clan had been doing completely fine in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. However, ever since you came, look at this! Properly look at all this! Look at what happened to our Chu Heavenly Clan's territory?! As for this... it is all thanks to you!!!" Chu Hongyi pointed at Chu Feng and reprimanded him nonstop.<br>As for the others, they lowered their heads silently. Although they did not say anything, Chu Feng was able to see expressions of blame from some people's faces.<br>"You all are blaming me for this?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"Bullshit! If we don't blame you, who else are we to blame? Me?"<br>"If it wasn't for you, how could we be reduced to such a state?" Chu Hongyi pointed at Chu Feng and lashed out.<br>"Little brother Chu Feng, what big brother Hongyi says is not without reason. If it wasn't for your recklessness back then, the Burnfield Monstrous Clan would not have gotten angry at us, they would not have come to destroy our city."<br>"Fortunately, we are in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm and protected by the special formation here. Had we not been in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, we would've likely had our souls destroyed and been killed by the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen."<br>Right at that moment, several people beside Chu Hongyi also stood up and began to speak.<br>Although their tones were not as rude and unreasonable as Chu Hongyi&rsquo;s, their words were filled with complaint.<br>&ldquo;According to you all, it was a mistake for me to save them back then?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Just because you all were unwilling to save them, you&rsquo;re blaming me for saving them?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng pointed to the Chu Heavenly Clansmen nearby. They were people that he had saved from the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen.<br>&ldquo;If you had held back, perhaps everything would have been fine. After all, we&rsquo;re in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, and cannot die,&rdquo; someone said. He was actually extremely confident when he said those words. It was as if what he said was the truth.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, you will not die. Since you won&rsquo;t die, why don&rsquo;t you tie this rope back on your body?&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed at the severed flame rope on the ground.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; That man&rsquo;s expression changed. He did not know how to respond. That flame rope was a tool for torturing people. Although it looked like simple flames, those flames were capable of burning one&rsquo;s soul. He did not want to experience the pain of his body being burned away repeatedly, did not want to be tied up by that rope again.<br>&ldquo;If the ones that were being tortured back then were you all, should I also have done nothing? Even if you all are to be tortured to a state of nervous breakdown and go insane, should I also do nothing?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>At that moment, not only did the people that had reprimanded Chu Feng earlier go completely quiet, but even the people that were only showing their blame toward Chu Feng on their faces revealed ashamed expressions.<br>If it were them that were being tortured, they would naturally hope for someone to save them. After all, no one wanted to go insane.<br>&ldquo;Chu Hongyi, earlier, you brought our clansmen into the Burnfield Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s territory. As a result, our clansmen were captured by the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen and publicly tortured.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though you were the main culprit behind all this and refused to save them, I did not do anything to you. Yet today, you started to blame me again?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned his gaze to Chu Hongyi.<br>&ldquo;The hell do you know? If you had contained yourself, perhaps everything would be peaceful now. However, you have now offended the Burnfield Monstrous Clan. How are we supposed to continue to exist in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm now?&rdquo; Chu Hongyi refuted him.<br>&ldquo;Oh? You&rsquo;re trying to tell me that we cannot offend anyone in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, right? Even if our clansmen are to be beaten up and tortured by others, we must look on and do nothing. If they are to be cursed at by others, we must tolerate it. Is that right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you all come to this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm with the intention of living like turtles?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you all come to the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm to disgrace our Old Ancestor?!&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke loudly.<br>At that moment, the crowd all went quiet. Even though Chu Hongyi wanted to refute Chu Feng, he ended up saying nothing in the end. Likely, even he was unable to find an excuse.<br>&ldquo;The ones to destroy our home are the Burnfield Monstrous Clan! The ones to injure you all are also the Burnfield Monstrous Clan!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, instead of blaming the Burnfield Monstrous Clan, you all instead came to blame me, Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you all only a tyrant at home, and completely meek and civil in public?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With how much you bully the weak and fear the strong, it&rsquo;s no wonder you are all looked down upon by others!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder the Dongguo Heavenly Clan has abandoned you!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice grew louder and louder. His tone was filled with anger and disappointment.<br>At that moment, not a single person from the Chu Heavenly Clan said anything. Instead, they lowered their heads even more. The expressions of shame on their faces grew even stronger.<br>Indeed, the ones that had humiliated them were the Burnfield Monstrous Clan. As for Chu Feng, he was the person that had stood up for them.<br>How could they not blame the Burnfield Monstrous Clan for bullying and humiliating them, and instead blame Chu Feng for standing up for them?<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, you all have kneeled before others for too long, and don&rsquo;t even know how to stand up anymore,&rdquo; seeing the silent crowd with their heads lowered, Chu Feng became even angrier.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, Shuangshaung, big brother Chu Ping and the others were all captured by people from the Burnfield Monstrous Clan. They declared that you should go over there. Otherwise, not only will big brother Chu Ping and the others suffer, but we too will not be able to be at peace.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, say, what should we do?&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, several Chu Heavenly Clansmen spoke up. Those people were all people that were tortured by the Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen earlier and rescued by Chu Feng.<br>They had never had any complaints toward Chu Feng. Instead, they were feeling very grateful toward him. And now, they were at a loss as to what to do, and could only seek guidance from him. Even though Chu Feng was the youngest among them, he had evidently become their pillar of support.<br>&ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he swept his gaze across the crowd. Suddenly, he stopped at one location. There was a banner there. The flagpole was already broken. As for the flag with the words &lsquo;Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo; on it, it was already destroyed.<br>Chu Feng extend his hand and made a grabbing motion. The broken flagpole arrived in his hand. With a thought, Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power surged forth. In a blink of an eye, the banner was restored to its original appearance, and began to flutter about even without wind.<br>Holding the Chu Heavenly Clan banner in his hand, Chu Feng ran his eyes across the crowd.<br>Loudly, he said, &ldquo;If you all don&rsquo;t know what to do, then I, Chu Feng, will teach you what to do!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;One must not silently endure humiliations and insults from others! Instead, one should return them with thanks!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, our home has been destroyed by the Burnfield Monstrous Clan! As such, we shall plant our clan&rsquo;s flag on their territory!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Henceforth, we shall be the ruler of that territory, and they shall be our slaves!&rdquo;<br></p></div>
