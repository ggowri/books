        <h1>Chapter 4753</h1>
        <div>: The Legendary Vicious Beast<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Activate the formation.&rdquo;<br>Noticing that the situation had gone awry, Zuoqiu Yanliang immediately shouted an order.<br>Li Muzhi and Song Qian quickly directed their beasts behind Zuoqiu Yanliang as they formed a series of hand seals and channeled two beams of light toward Zuoqiu Yanliang.<br>At this moment, their auras achieved synchronicity.<br>Li Muzhi and Song Qian&rsquo;s Hidden Dragon Swords came under Zuoqiu Yanliang&rsquo;s control, and they quickly flew over to the latter side. At the same time, the Duanmu Brothers and the other personal disciples also channeled the energy of the supporting formation into Zuoqiu Yanliang.<br>A brilliant light glowed from Zuoqiu Yanliang&rsquo;s body as his aura grew towering, reminiscent of an inviolable deity in the sky. No beings could hope to fight against him.<br>Whoosh!<br>However, a second terrifying howl coming broke his domineering aura, and this time around, a humongous beast tore through the sphere of wind to appear before everyone&rsquo;s eyes.<br>It was a demonic serpent with a peculiar appearance. It had two heads that looked oddly similar to that of a tiger, just much more terrifying. Its crimson eyes and teeth gave him a sinister appearance. Its size was also tremendous, such that even the part of its body that had broken through the sphere of wind was already more than fifty thousand meters huge.<br>All of the other beasts present were huge in their own rights too, but before this monster, they looked incredibly small and humble. As for the cultivators, they looked no more than specks of dust.<br>&ldquo;Could that monster be the legendary Twinheaded Tiger Serpent? It&rsquo;s no wonder why there are no witness accounts of it. It turns out that it&rsquo;s the legendary Hellking.&rdquo;<br>There were rumors of an incredibly powerful and intelligent monster with the head of a tiger and the body of a serpent lurking in the Vicious Beast Hellworld. Thanks to that, the disciples were able to recognize its identity of the bizarre beast even though this was the first time they were seeing it.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only at rank three Martial Exalted level. It looks like that&rsquo;s all there is to the Hellking. Brothers, we shall become heroes who have stopped this calamity today!&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Yanliang looked much more excited compared to the others. Even though the Twinheaded Tiger Serpent looked terrifying, its aura showed that it was only at rank three Martial Exalted level. He definitely had the means to deal with an enemy of such caliber.<br>Just the thought that he would be able to defeat the Hellking and stop the legendary Cleansing made him incredibly excited.<br>So, he quickly formed a series of hand seals which caused the three Hidden Dragon Swords to grow over ten thousand meters long, emanating the aura of a rank three Martial Exalted level cultivator.<br>He was intending to end things in a single blow.<br>&ldquo;Hold it right there!&rdquo;<br>But just as Zuoqiu Yanliang was about to make a move, a voice suddenly sounded in the air. Everyone was taken aback from the abrupt voice as they could tell that it hadn&rsquo;t come from any of them. It was coming from the ground.<br>They quickly turned their sights toward the origin of the voice, only to see a figure rising to the air.<br>Everyone was shocked upon seeing the figure, especially Li Muzhi and the others. They rubbed their eyes in bewilderment, wondering if they were seeing things.<br>The figure who had appeared was no other than Chu Feng.<br>However, this should have been impossible as Chu Feng was neither a Hidden Dragon Disciple nor a personal disciple. He wasn&rsquo;t qualified to enter this trial.<br>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Zuoqiu Yanliang asked.<br>At the same time, Li Muzhi also asked, &ldquo;Chu Feng, how did you get in here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng? He&rsquo;s that Chu Feng? How audacious! Is this a place where you can enter?&rdquo;<br>Upon learning who Chu Feng was, Zuoqiu Yanliang&rsquo;s gaze turned even more livid.<br>As there was no evidence whatsoever, he simply figured that Chu Feng had snuck in here on his own accord and sentenced him guilty.<br>To be fair, the others also had the same suspicions as well as they couldn&rsquo;t think of another reason why Chu Feng would appear here.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t sneak in here. I was cultivating in the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake when I stumbled upon a spirit formation gate that brought me here. This can be easily verified later on,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You got teleported here from Blackwater Sixfinger Lake? What kind of nonsense are you talking about? Do you take us for fools? Does this matter even need verifying? No matter how you try to explain things, you can&rsquo;t possibly talk your way out of this!&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Yanliang&rsquo;s attitude turned even viler than before. If not for the fact that he was fully focused on driving the Hidden Dragon Swords, he might have already attacked Chu Feng by now.<br>&ldquo;I heard rumors from an elder that the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake and the Vicious Beast Hellworld are linked, but that elder has only read about it in an ancient record and couldn&rsquo;t verify the authenticity of the information. Could the two places really be linked?&rdquo; Ma Yueyue muttered.<br>However, as soon as she said those words, she was immediately faced with Zuoqiu Yanliang&rsquo;s criticism, &ldquo;Ma Yueyue, are you out of your mind? How can you believe an excuse he fabricated on the spot?&rdquo;<br>After berating Ma Yueyue, he turned to Chu Feng and sneered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time for you now. Once I get rid of this Hellking, you&rsquo;ll have hell to pay for.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, he began channeling the three Hidden Dragon Swords to continue his attack toward the Hellking.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment, don&rsquo;t attack the Hellking carelessly!&rdquo; Chu Feng shouted.<br>Seemingly knowing that Zuoqiu Yanliang wouldn&rsquo;t just listen to him, he quickly began explaining, &ldquo;Listen to me, this beast is assimilated with the black tornado, and it&rsquo;s currently using the power of the tornado to raise its cultivation. The current prowess it&rsquo;s displaying is unlikely to be its true strength. If you attack it carelessly, you&rsquo;ll just anger it and direct its attention toward us. If so, we&rsquo;ll be in deep trouble.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng, how should we deal with this then?&rdquo; Li Muzhi asked.<br>He knew how capable Chu Feng was, so he figured that Chu Feng must have noticed something that led to him saying those words.<br>&ldquo;Hand your soul possession treasures to me. I can control it while it&rsquo;s still in the midst of cultivating. As long as we can put it under our control, we&rsquo;ll naturally be able to stop its rampage,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng, is that really fine?&rdquo; Li Muzhi asked.<br>&ldquo;Li Muzhi, are you out of your mind? How could you listen to the words of that trash? Someone like him has no right to command me! Don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;re the strongest disciple in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect just because you&rsquo;ve broken Lord Dugu Lingtian&rsquo;s record!&rdquo; Zuoqiu Yanliang harrumphed as he directed the three Hidden Dragon Swords toward the Twinheaded Tiger Serpent.<br>The prowess of the three Hidden Dragon Swords was nothing to scoff at. With the three of them striking simultaneously, even the black tornado surrounding them was immediately sliced into two. But shockingly, the three swords were unable to leave even a scratch on the Twinheaded Tiger Serpent!<br>Grarr!<br>The Twinheaded Tiger Serpent let loose a furious roar. Its body wiggled a little as yet another head rose out of its neck. The moment the third tiger head formed, the aura of the beast began rising from rank three Martial Exalted level to rank four.<br>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The hearts of all of the disciples clenched upon seeing this sight. None of them spoke a word, but they all subconsciously turned to look at Chu Feng.<br>If they thought that Chu Feng was talking rubbish before, they were wondering now if Chu Feng might have actually been right about this.<br></p></div>
