        <div> - I Possess The Evidence <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s descendant? That sort of talent is simply too frightening.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Genius, that&rsquo;s what an actual genius is, an actual genius is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan, such a genius actually appeared in the Chu Heavenly Clan again?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh how much the heavens have favored them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I get it now! That Prophesied Child is simply not that Wuma Heavenly Clansman. Instead, it&rsquo;s Chu Feng&hellip; it&rsquo;s definitely the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Chu Feng!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. With such talent, it must be him&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Apart from Linghu Hongfei, there&rsquo;s likely no one in the current Ancestral Martial Starfield that could match a genius like him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already guessed that child would be a demon-level genius. However, never would I expect for him to be a demon-level genius of such a caliber. It would appear that my trip here today has been well worthwhile.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone knows that Linghu Hongfei has surpassed Chu Xuanyuan. The only pity is that they are not from the same era, and cannot be compared against each another.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son has now come to a sudden emergence, and he also possesses demon-level talent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While Linghu Hongfei might not be able to contend against Chu Xuanyuan, he will be able to contend against Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even without that prophecy, these two demon-level geniuses are still destined to battle one another. If I can witness that battle, I will not have lived my life in vain.&rdquo;<br>After witnessing Chu Feng&rsquo;s might, the powers that were invited by the Fang Heavenly Clan were not only astonished, but they even began to look forward to the prophesied battle.<br>They were not feeling grief like the Fang Heavenly Clansmen. Instead, they were very excited.<br>Although they had originally hoped for the Fang Heavenly Clan to win against the Chu Heavenly Clan, they were unable to contain their emotions after witnessing Chu Feng&rsquo;s might.<br>There were countless geniuses in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. However, extremely few among them would be of a demon-level caliber like Chu Feng.<br>Those people all felt fortunate to be able to witness such a demon-level genius.<br>Hearing the discussions of the crowd, the Fang Heavenly Clansmen&rsquo;s expressions turned uglier and uglier.<br>They had invited those powers so that they could witness the humiliation of the Chu Heavenly Clan, not so that they could exclaim in admiration toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent, much less cheer for him.<br>Merely, as matters stood, there was nothing the Fang Heavenly Clan could do about it. After all, that Chu Feng was too unreasonably powerful.<br>They had been thoroughly defeated, and were able to completely accept their defeat.<br>&ldquo;Are you all still planning to continue fighting?&rdquo; Chu Feng stood in midair and asked loudly.<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the Fang Heavenly Clansmen all silently lowered their heads.<br>Facing Chu Feng, even their Fang Hualong was instantly defeated. As for them&hellip; how could they possibly fight him?<br>Although the Fang Heavenly Clansmen did not answer Chu Feng, they all began to move toward the exit of the grand formation. One by one, they left the grand formation.<br>They had already given up.<br>When they entered the grand formation, they were filled with morale and determined that victory was in their grasp.<br>When they left the grand formation, they were utterly defeated and completely dispirited.<br>Seeing this scene, the Fang Heavenly Clansmen all felt very pained.<br>That said, apart from the Fang Heavenly Clansmen, there was another group of people that were feeling very displeased. Those were the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that were fighting inside the grand formation, yet refused to fight alongside Chu Feng the moment he entered the grand formation.<br>They had fought so hard. Yet, they were unable to match the Fang Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s three thousand elites.<br>Chu Feng, on the other hand, defeated the Fang Heavenly Clan all by himself.<br>Naturally, they would be feeling very upset because of this.<br>After a short moment, only Chu Feng and the twelve other Chu Heavenly Clansmen remained in the grand formation.<br>All of the Fang Heavenly Clansmen had exited the grand formation.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng finally descended from the sky and inserted the banner he carried on his shoulder into the ground.<br>Even though the outcome of the battle had been decided, Chu Feng&rsquo;s actions still shook the hearts of many among the crowd.<br>After all, Chu Feng had won the victory all by himself.<br>&ldquo;Milord, will the Purpletree Ordinary Realm belong to our Chu Heavenly Clan from today on?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Wuming Fenghuo.<br>&ldquo;Of course. If the Fang Heavenly Clan dares to cause any trouble, I, Wuming Fenghuo, will definitely not spare them,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo guaranteed.<br>&ldquo;Thank you Milord,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist at Wuming Fenghuo. Then, he asked, &ldquo;Milord, there is another matter that I wish to seek Milord&rsquo;s assistance with.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What is it? Speak away,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo said.<br>&ldquo;This junior has not poisoned my clan&rsquo;s clan chief. This Chu Feng is being wrongly accused. I hope that Milord will be able to uphold justice for this Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Milord, you must not listen to his crazy and unfounded ravings. That Chu Feng had poisoned our Lord Clan Chief, it&rsquo;s something that we all personally witnessed. He cannot refuse to admit to it,&rdquo; seeing that Chu Feng actually brought up the matter of the poisoning of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Chu Hanqing and the others immediately spoke out against him.<br>They were truly panicking. With the talent that Chu Feng had revealed, if he were to be allowed to continue to grow, he would definitely become the second Chu Xuanyuan. At that time&hellip; they would be the ones to suffer.<br>Furthermore, it seemed that Wuming Fenghuo was rather interested in Chu Feng. For Chu Feng to redress an injustice, Wuming Fenghuo would likely side in his favor.<br>The situation at hand was very bad for them. As such, they had no choice but to incite the feelings of their clansmen to prevent Wuming Fenghuo from siding with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Milord, that Chu Feng had poisoned our Lord Clan Chief. We all personally witnessed it with our very eyes. The evidence is undeniable, how could he possibly say that he was wronged?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, please uphold justice and do not allow yourself to easily trust the lies of that child.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Hanqing, many other Chu Heavenly Clansmen began to speak. not only were Chu Hanqing&rsquo;s subordinates among them, but there were also Chu Heavenly Clansmen that had been completely deceived.<br>Even though they felt great appreciation for Chu Feng, they were still unable keep themselves from detesting him after seeing him poisoning their Lord Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;All of you, shut up!&rdquo;<br>However, the reports of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were instead met with a furious shout from Wuming Fenghuo.<br>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen all shut their mouths, as they were able to feel Wuming Fenghuo&rsquo;s anger.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, they said that they had personally witnessed you poisoning your clan chief, that the evidence is undeniable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet you say that you were wronged. In that case, do you have any evidence that you were wronged?&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo asked.<br>Chu Hanqing and the others were secretly delighted upon hearing Wuming Fenghuo&rsquo;s question.<br>They knew very well that Chu Feng could not present any evidence.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I possess the evidence.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice was heard. That voice caused Chu Hanqing and his accomplices&rsquo; hearts to tighten.<br>The reason for that was because that voice was not Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice.<br></p></div>
