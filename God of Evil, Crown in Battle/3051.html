        <h1>Chapter 3050</h1>
        <div> - Li Heavenly Clan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The light in the center of the Upper Realm Gate was changing nonstop.<br>Originally, it was white. Gradually, it started to form an image. Like a mirror, it reflected an image.<br>However, the image reflected by the mirror was not the plain that Chu Feng and the others were standing on. Instead, it was someplace else.<br>"Could it be that... that is the other Upper Realm?" Chu Feng already had his guesses in mind. Merely, he was unable to be certain.<br>"It would appear that the heavens want to bring ruin upon our Chu Heavenly Clan," Compared to Chu Feng's uncertainty, Chu Youyuan's face turned pale upon seeing the image reflected by that mirror. Fear filled his face.<br>"Milord, could it be that you know which Upper Realm that is?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"That is the Great Li Upper Realm. It is the Upper Realm governed by the Li Heavenly Clan," Chu Youyuan said.<br>"Is the Li Heavenly Clan really powerful?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"The Li Heavenly Clan is one of the Ten Great Heavenly Clans in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. They are stronger than our Chu Heavenly Clan," Chu Youyuan said.<br>"This..." Hearing those words, Chu Feng started to frown.<br>Looking at Chu Youyuan's reaction, Chu Feng was able to guess that the Li Heavenly Clan should be very powerful.<br>Otherwise, Chu Youyuan would not be so nervous.<br>Merely, Chu Feng had not expected the Li Heavenly Clan to be one of the Ancestral Martial Starfield's Ten Great Heavenly Clans.<br>Furthermore, judging by Chu Youyuan's behavior, Chu Feng was able to guess that their Chu Heavenly Clan was likely not among the so-called Ten Great Heavenly Clans.<br>"Li Heavenly Clan?"<br>"Chu Feng, could that possibly be the Heavenly Clan that Li Yue'er belongs to?" Suddenly, Her Lady Queen's skeptical voice sounded from beside Chu Feng's ears.<br>"Li Yue'er, was it?" Chu Feng was surprised upon hearing Her Lady Queen's words.<br>He suddenly recalled the little beauty, the girl who had dressed up as a man in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm and proclaimed herself to be Young Master Li Ming.<br>Back then, Li Yue'er had declared that she would enter the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm to train.<br>However, after Chu Feng arrived in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, he had heard no news regarding Li Yue'er, nor did he hear any news regarding Young Master Li Ming.<br>There could only be two possible explanations. One, Li Yue'er had entered closed-door training after arriving in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>As for the other, it would be that she simply did not arrive in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>Otherwise, it would be impossible for someone of Li Yue'er's talent to not cause a sensation after arriving in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>That said, whether or not Li Yue'er arrived in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was actually insignificant to Chu Feng. As long as she was safe, Chu Feng would be at ease.<br>After all, that girl Li Yue'er could be considered to have a friendly relationship with Chu Feng. In fact, when Chu Feng was suffering from the backlash of his Evil God Sword, it was that girl who had helped him, and saved him from his crisis.<br>As such, Li Yue'er could be considered to be Chu Feng's benefactor.<br>Furthermore, Li Yue'er's strength could not be underestimated either. Chu Feng felt that Li Yue'er's talent would not only shine in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. He felt that even if she were placed in the Upper Realms or the entire Starfield, she would still become everyone's focus.<br>That said, compared to Li Yue'er's personal talent, Chu Feng was also quite interested in her background.<br>After all, based on the various abilities and treasures that girl possessed, her background was definitely extraordinary.<br>That Li Heavenly Clan might very possibly be Li Yue'er's clan.<br>"Milord, I still wish to know exactly how powerful the Li Heavenly Clan is. How enormous of a disparity does our Chu Heavenly Clan have when compared to them?" Chu Feng asked.<br>As the saying goes, 'know yourself, know your enemy, and you will be ever-victorious.' Since the Li Heavenly Clan would very likely become their Chu Heavenly Clan's greatest enemy, Chu Feng must make certain of their strength.<br>"Being one of the Ten Great Heavenly Clans is already sufficient to prove how powerful the Li Heavenly Clan is. That said, we actually also do not know exactly how strong the Li Heavenly Clan's peak experts are right now."<br>"After all, they've been in closed-door training the entire time."<br>"That said, whilst our Chu Heavenly Clan's younger generations are still competing with our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm as their stage, the Li Heavenly Clan's younger generations are already demonstrating their extraordinary talent with the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield as their stage."<br>"Merely by the disparity in the younger generations' strength, you will be able to understand how vast a disparity exists between our Chu Heavenly Clan and the Li Heavenly Clan."<br>"Chu Feng, let's take you for example. With your current strength, you should be fully deserving of the title of being the strongest younger generation in our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm."<br>"However, if you are to be compared to the Li Heavenly Clan's younger generations, you will still be significantly weaker."<br>"This is especially true for that Li Heavenly Clan's Li Ming. Back then, he was even deemed to be an existence capable of becoming the next Chu Xuanyuan," Chu Youyuan gasped with admiration.<br>"Li Ming?" Chu Feng's heart immediately moved upon hearing those words. Li Ming, wasn't that the name Li Yue'er had used in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?<br>Furthermore, during Chu Feng's previous conversation with Li Yue'er, he had noticed that the name Li Ming held great importance to her.<br>This meant that the person named Li Ming had a special significance to Li Yue'er.<br>"Lord Youyuan, has that Li Ming ever used the name Young Master Li Ming?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"Chu Feng, could it be that you know him?" Chu Youyuan's eyes immediately changed upon hearing Chu Feng's question.<br>"I don't know him," Chu Feng said.<br>"In that case, how did you know that Li Ming used the title Young Master Li Ming before? Logically, not many people should know about this matter," Chu Youyuan asked.<br>"I have a friend. She used the title Young Master Li Ming and proclaimed herself to be Li Ming," Chu Feng said.<br>"Your friend?" Hearing those words, Chu Youyuan's eyes started to shine even brighter.<br>"It's impossible for that friend of mine to really be Li Ming. After all, she is a woman, and her strength is nowhere as powerful as what Lord Youyuan has described Li Ming's strength to be," Chu Feng said.<br>"Oh, this old man remembers now. You're talking about that girl with some relationship to you in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, right?"<br>"This head of mine, I actually forgot about that," Chu Youyuan patted his forehead with an expression of sudden realization.<br>"Senior, you know about that girl?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"This old man deliberately investigated what you experienced in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Thus, I've also investigated that girl."<br>"That said, that girl has concealed her identity extremely well. However, she would not have used the title Young Master Li Ming without reason."<br>"If this old man has guessed right, she should be Li Ming's younger sister, Li Yue'er," Chu Youyuan said.<br>After hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart jolted. Hearing till this point, even the names fit one another. This had practically verified Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s identity.<br>That said, Chu Feng wanted to make a final verification. Thus, he continued to ask, &ldquo;In that case, that girl is also a member of the Li Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Since she&rsquo;s Li Ming&rsquo;s younger sister, she would naturally be a Li Heavenly Clansman,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan said.<br>After saying those words, Chu Youyuan sighed. He said, &ldquo;Speaking of it, that girl is quite a pitiful person.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
