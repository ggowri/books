        <h1>Chapter 3645</h1>
        <div> - Chu Feng Is My Brother<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ever since Nangong Yifan came to the Divine Armament Villa, Wuming Yuanzhi, Kong Ci and many other people of the younger generation had challenged him. They had all wanted to experience the strength of the strongest person of the younger generation in the All-heaven Starfield.<br>Unfortunately, without exception, they were all ignored by Nangong Yifan.<br>His arrogance, indifference and condescending nature was deeply engraved in those younger generations&rsquo; hearts.<br>Before that moment, no one would&rsquo;ve imagined that, in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, a person of the younger generation apart from Linghu Hongfei would be able to make Nangong Yifan issue a challenge.<br>However, at that moment, they learned that someone was actually capable of that. Furthermore, that person was not only able to force Nangong Yifan to voluntarily issue a challenge, but he was also able to drive him mad with rage.<br>As for that person, he was none other than Chu Feng.<br>The crowd were all able to tell that the reason why Nangong Yifan had suddenly issued a challenge and moved to attack Chu Feng was not merely because he wanted to spar with him. Instead, it was because he had been completely humiliated by him in the chess formation.<br>Thus, he wanted to use the challenge as a pretext to get revenge.<br>It was also because of that that Lord Shoujian&rsquo;s gaze suddenly turned cold the moment Nangong Yifan rushed to attack Chu Feng.<br>He would naturally not allow him to act impudently in his Divine Armament Villa.<br>As for allowing him to injure Chu Feng, that would be even more impossible.<br>However, shortly afterward, Lord Shoujian&rsquo;s gaze changed. In the end, he did not interfere to stop Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>It turned out that someone had suddenly flown out from the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s crowd. That person not only flew past Chu Feng, but he was also rushing straight towards Nangong Yifan.<br>It was Wuming Yuanzhi.<br>Wuming Yuanzhi was rushing straight toward Nangong Yifan. He made a fist with one hand and smashed it toward Nangong Yifan.<br>Faced with Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s incoming fist, Nangong Yifan showed no sign of evading. Like Wuming Yuanzhi, he also shot forth a fist.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>The two fists collided. Energy ripples scattered all over. Even though the two of them were clearly composed of flesh and blood, the sound of their fists&rsquo; collision was many times more ear-piercing than a clash of steel.<br>The two of them were both rank two Exalted. After their fists collided, Nangong Yifan landed on the spot.<br>However, Wuming Yuanzhi was struck backward. When he landed, he took several steps back before finally managing to stabilize himself.<br>&ldquo;Sssss~~~&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, many people of the younger generation were unable to keep themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air as they gasped with amazement. At the same time, unease emerged in their hearts.<br>Wuming Yuanzhi was no ordinary person. He was one of the top geniuses of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>However, although he possessed the same cultivation as Nangong Yifan, he was at a disadvantage in the collision of fists.<br>That said, although the crowd were all worrying for Wuming Yuanzhi, Wuming Yuanzhi himself showed no signs of worry.<br>He still had a strong expression on his face. It was as if the one who had come out losing in the collision was not him, but Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;Nangong Yifan, you are not qualified to fight my brother Chu Feng. If you want to fight him, you must first defeat me: Wuming Yuanzhi.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Wuming Yuanzhi turned around and signaled to Chu Feng with his eyes.<br>That look was like a close friend of many years. This was completely different from the fellow who had forced Chu Feng to fight and decided to directly attack him.<br>&ldquo;Since when did my brother Chu Feng become your brother?&rdquo; asked Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; Wuming Yuanzhi replied loudly.<br>Seeing Wuming Yuanzhi like that, Chu Feng suddenly realized that he was not purely an arrogant, despotic and unreasonable fellow.<br>Rather, he was someone with a very irritable temper and overly frank, someone who would follow his heart&rsquo;s desires and do as he pleased.<br>At that moment, the displeasure Chu Feng held towards Wuming Yuanzhi decreased a lot.<br>Of course, this was most definitely not purely because he was standing up for him. Rather, it was because Chu Feng felt that he possessed an amusing personality.<br>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; Nangong Yifan snorted with contempt toward Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s words. Then, impatiently, he said, &ldquo;I will give you a word of advice. Don't interfere in this matter and disappear from my face right now. Do that, and I'll consider it as if nothing had happened. Otherwise&hellip; I will have you forever regret your decision today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh-ho. Never would I have imagined that you, Nangong Yifan, is someone who is either completely quiet, refusing to speak, or a boastful fellow who spouts bullshit all over should you start speaking. Furthermore, you boast with such confidence. You&rsquo;ve truly enlightened me of what being boastful means,&rdquo; Wuming Yuanzhi was not to be outdone, and mocked back.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already said everything that I should. If you insist on courting death, I will make you whole,&rdquo; Nangong Yifan said coldly.<br>&ldquo;Arrogant fellow, this young master has wanted to experience your strength since long ago. Why don&rsquo;t you show me exactly what sort of capability you possess today?&rdquo;<br>Wuming Yuanzhi let out a cold snort. Then, with a flip of his wrist, a sword appeared in his hand.<br>The sword was silver. It was not shining with light. On the contrary, it appeared very simple and unadorned.<br>However, the aura emitted by the sword revealed that it was no ordinary weapon. No one would dare to question its might.<br>The reason for that was because that sword was an Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>The appearance of an Incomplete Exalted Armament greatly increased Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s battle power.<br>However, Wuming Yuanzhi did not stop with only that. After revealing his Incomplete Exalted Armament, his body started to shine a dazzling golden light.<br>After that golden light appeared, an enormous image appeared in the sky.<br>That was a golden lion.<br>Divine Power!!!<br>After Wuming Yuanzhi revealed his Divine Power, his cultivation increased from rank two Exalted to rank three Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>After his cultivation increased, Wuming Yuanzhi took a step forward and turned into a flash of light that shot straight toward Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Faced with the incoming Wuming Yuanzhi, Nangong Yifan let out a cold snort. Dazzling light also appeared on his body, and the image of an enormous warrior appeared in the sky,<br>He too possessed Divine Power!!!<br>Needless to say, after Nangong Yifan unleashed his Divine Power, his cultivation also increased.<br>In the blink of an eye, the two men collided.<br>They did not use many martial skills. Instead, they were fighting head-on.<br>This time around, Wuming Yuanzhi and Nangong Yifan fought for ten whole bouts.<br>After ten bouts passed, Wuming Yuanzhi was knocked away.<br>At that moment, Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s expression had turned ugly.<br>Even though this time around, he had managed to fight Nangong Yifan for ten whole bouts before being knocked away, he had a very ugly expression on his face.<br>The reason for that was because he was holding an Incomplete Exalted Armament in his hand, whereas Nangong Yifan was empty-handed.<br>Even with the help of an Incomplete Exalted Armament, he was actually still no match for Nangong Yifan, and could only last ten bouts before being knocked away.<br>Even if he did not wish to admit to it, Wuming Yuanzhi realized that there was an enormous disparity between him and Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;Wuming Yuanzhi, it&rsquo;s best that you quickly beat it. Don't humiliate yourself here. We&rsquo;ve already told you that you're simply not on the same level as Nangong Yifan.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were all rejoicing at Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s humiliation, and started loudly shouting insults at him.<br></p></div>
