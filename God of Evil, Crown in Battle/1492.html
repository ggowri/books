        <div> - The Despair Of The Weak<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Hahahaha&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly, Qin Wentian burst into loud laughter.<br>His laughter was extremely ear-piercing and strange. This was no longer a laughter of arrogance; it was more like the frantic laughter of someone going mad.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, did you really think that you would be my match?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Earlier, I was merely playing with you. Right now, I&rsquo;ll let you know what despair means.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Qin Wentian spread open his arms. His shattered clothes began to rapidly flutter. Even his long black hair was dancing in the air. With him as the center, a gale surged forth.<br>However, soon, the crowd began to notice that Qin Wentians&rsquo;s black hair was turning red. More and more of his hair began to change in color, and it also began to grow redder and redder.<br>In merely a short moment, his black hair had all transformed into red hair. The red of his hair was not a fiery red. Instead, it was blood red; crimson. It appeared extremely strange and frightening.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Qin Wentian&rsquo;s body moved. He turned into a ray of red light and surged toward Chu Feng with a frightening amount of oppressive might.<br>Qin Wentian&rsquo;s speed was too quick. In an instant, he had arrived before Chu Feng. He pushed forth his palm, and a violent martial power was shot toward Chu Feng. He was planning to crush Chu Feng to death.<br>However, who was Chu Feng? He was someone who had obtained absolute mastery in world spirit techniques. Furthermore, his reactions in battle were extremely fast.<br>Facing Qin Wentian&rsquo;s frontal attack, Chu Feng did not decide to guard against the attack. Instead, he unleashed an offensive spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>His spirit formation came as an enormous hammer. The enormous hammer was so large that it appeared like a shield as it completely covered the space before Chu Feng when it successfully blocked Qin Wentian&rsquo;s incoming attack.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation was actually an offensive one, and that enormous hammer was actually used for attacking. Blocking Qin Wentian&rsquo;s attack was merely a trivial matter for the enormous hammer. The true purpose that Chu Feng had in using this enormous hammer was to attack Qin Wentian.<br>&ldquo;Insignificant talent.&rdquo;<br>However, Qin Wentian was not weak himself. After his hair color changed, all aspects of his strength were increased.<br>Regardless of whether it was his speed, his power or even his mental ability, they had all been increased many times compared to before.<br>At this moment, he had determined that Chu Feng&rsquo;s enormous hammer spirit formation was not something that could be looked down on. Thus, he did not face it head-on, and instead used a movement martial skill to dodge it.<br>Not only did he dodge Chu Feng&rsquo;s enormous hammer, he had also seized the opportunity to arrive behind Chu Feng in a flash. He was planning to launch a surprise attack at Chu Feng from behind.<br>Unfortunately, Chu Feng&rsquo;s reactions were truly too strong. Even if Chu Feng had closed his eyes, he would still be able to see each and every action of Qin Wentian. A surprise attack like the one that Qin Wentian used was simply unable to injure Chu Feng in the slightest.<br>Right at the moment when Qin Wentian was about to approach Chu Feng, Chu Feng suddenly turned around and dodged Qin Wentian&rsquo;s attack. At the same time he dodged the attack, he clenched his hand, and a spirit formation spear appeared within it. Pointing that spear toward Qin Wentian&rsquo;s throat, Chu Fent thrust it forward.<br>&ldquo;Break~~~&rdquo;<br>This attack came too suddenly. Qin Wentian was unable to hide from or dodge Chu Feng&rsquo;s spear. Thus, he could only meet it head-on and try to break it. He grabbed onto the incoming spear with his hands and began to instill martial power into them to activate a martial skill. &ldquo;Bang,&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s spear was shattered by Qin Wentian.<br>However, at the moment when the world spirit spear shattered, a dagger had appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand. With a speed even faster than before, he thrust toward Qin Wentian once again.<br>&ldquo;You dare to continue your attack, do you not fear that I&rsquo;ll crush your hand?&rdquo; A flash of coldness shone through Qin Wentian&rsquo;s eyes. He formed a claw with his hand and grabbed toward Chu Feng.<br>This time around, what he planned to grab was not the dagger, but Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand. He was planning to shatter Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand in front of all these people to avenge the humiliation he had received earlier.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at the moment when Qin Wentian&rsquo;s claw hand moved by Chu Feng&rsquo;s dagger and was about to grab onto Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand, Chu Feng&rsquo;s footsteps suddenly moved, and his entire body shifted backwards. At the same time, the dagger in his hand turned into a ray of light and was shot toward Qin Wentian&rsquo;s dantian like an arrow.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>In an instant, Chu Feng had attacked with countless changes. Chu Feng knew extremely well when to advance and when to retreat. Although Qin Wentian managed to react, his reaction was too slow.<br>&ldquo;Puuu,&rdquo; scarlet blood sprayed down from the sky. Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit dagger had pierced into Qin Wentian&rsquo;s body.<br>Although Qin Wentian had managed to avert his dantian from being pierced, he was still injured by Chu Feng; a large hole had been pierced through his waist.<br>&ldquo;Qin Wentian was actually injured again?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What amazing techniques! This Chu Feng has practically perfectly calculated all his attacks and defenses. But, a fight between experts is rapidly changing. How did this Chu Feng manage to think of all this in such a short period of time?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why&hellip; this child is a true demon level character.&rdquo;<br>The bout between Chu Feng and Qin Wentian lasted only an instant. Ordinary disciples were unable to see anything at all. They only managed to discover that Qin Wentian was injured. However, the true experts present were able to see the battle extremely clearly.<br>Qin Wentian was not weak. It could be said that his battle power was not at all inferior to Chu Feng&rsquo;s. However, in such a short period of time, he had been injured by Chu Feng. He had not been defeated by Chu Feng in terms of battle power. Instead, he had been defeated in terms of wits.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle intelligence was simply off the charts. He had managed to calculate each and every attack, defense, dodge, retreat and even which body turns and footsteps he should use. With each movement, he had already thought about what his next movement should be.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s calculation ability was something that even all the headmasters present found themselves to be inferior to.<br>They had only managed to see through Chu Feng&rsquo;s movements and attacks because they possessed high levels of cultivation. If they were at the same level of cultivation as Chu Feng, it was likely that they would not be a match for him.<br>&ldquo;Qin Wentian, I finally understand what you meant by despair. Indeed, you have given me great despair. I feel so much despair at how weak you are,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to Qin Wentian with a beaming smile. It was as if he was looking at a joke.<br>Chu Feng admitted that Qin Wentian was very strong, strong enough to be able to defeat Nie Wan&rsquo;er and Nie Xi&rsquo;er.<br>Unfortunately, his current opponent was Chu Feng. Before Chu Feng, no matter how strong Qin Wentian might be, he would still be weak.<br>Among those of the same cultivation, there had yet to be anyone capable of matching Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing those words, Qin Wentian&rsquo;s veins started to bulge explosively in anger, and his complexion turned a deep red.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo; As for Chu Feng, the smile on his face grew even denser and became filled with mockery.<br>&ldquo;Ahhh~~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Qin Wentian looked toward the sky and roared. Suddenly a crimson gaseous substance actually began to emit from within him. In an instant, the crimson gaseous substance completely submerged Chu Feng.<br>That gaseous substance was no ordinary substance, there were actually bodies moving about within it. The number of bodies were so great that they numbered several millions.<br>Those people were struggling, screaming and shouting miserably.<br>With this sort of change, an enormous aura began to emit from Qin Wentian&rsquo;s body. At this moment, Qin Wentian&rsquo;s battle power was no longer that of an ordinary rank four Half Martial Emperor. Instead, he was infinitely close to that of a rank five Half Martial Emperor.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; is a demonic technique. Qin Wentian actually trains in a demonic technique?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Dugu, exactly where has this disciple of yours been undergoing closed-door training for these past couple years? This technique of his does not seem like something that one would be able to learn with merely closed-door training,&rdquo; The Ten Thousand Flowers Garden&rsquo;s headmaster asked emotionally.<br>&ldquo;Bloodthirsty Demonic Technique, those crimson silhouettes are real living beings, creatures that he has killed and sealed within his body. They are what give him his current great power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is a demonic technique that can only be trained by killing others. If he has killed evil people, it would be fine. However, the people he&rsquo;s killed number several millions. How could they all be evil? He has most definitely willfully slaughtered the innocent. To increase his strength, he has taken several millions of innocent lives. Oh, how enormous of a crime this is!&rdquo; The Sword Crafting Villa&rsquo;s headmaster said. He had an expression of hatred all over his face.<br>The so-called demonic techniques were not righteous martial techniques. Generally, they relied on nefarious means to increase one&rsquo;s strength.<br>At this moment, the technique that Qin Wentian had unleashed was an archetype of the life-killing demonic techniques. It was a technique that relied on the lives of the people the user killed in order to increase the user&rsquo;s power.<br>This was the fastest method to increase one&rsquo;s power. However, it was also one of the most immoral methods, a method that the people of the world despised.<br>&ldquo;And here I was wondering how Qin Wentian, with his talent, was able to become a rank one Half Martial Emperor in such a short period of time. Turns out that he has actually trained in such a frightening demonic technique.&rdquo; Nie Wan&rsquo;er and Nie Xi&rsquo;er were unable to contain themselves and started cursing Qin Wentian too.<br>&ldquo;Headmaster Dugu, the way I see it, there is no need to continue on with this match. A disciple like him should be executed. Else, he will only bring harm in the future,&rdquo; The World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master said.<br>&ldquo;Headmaster Dugu, if you are unable to kill him yourself, I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; The Jadewater Temple&rsquo;s headmaster said.<br>&ldquo;No, I wish to continue watching,&rdquo; Dugu Xingfeng said.<br>&ldquo;Watching what? Could it be that you think a disciple like him is still worthy of your protection?&rdquo; The Eight Desolate Mountain Ranges&rsquo; headmaster asked.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, please rest assured. I, Dugu Xingfeng, am not someone devoid of sense. Qin Wentian has committed the greatest sin of martial cultivators. Even without you all suggesting this to me, I would still not let him off.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, before that, I wish to see if Chu Feng can handle the Qin Wentian who has unleashed his demonic technique,&rdquo; Dugu Xingfeng said as he looked to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing what Dugu Xingfeng said, the crowd all turned their gazes to Chu Feng. At the moment when their gazes landed on Chu Feng, all of their expressions changed to those of great shock.<br></p></div>
