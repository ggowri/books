        <h1>Chapter 4140</h1>
        <div> - Rank Four Exalted Taboo<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Using an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill, Chu Feng took on an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.<br>Then, using a rank one Exalted Taboo Martial Skill, he took on a rank two Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.<br>And after that, using the same rank one Exalted Taboo Martial Skill, he actually took on a rank three Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.<br>This scene completely astonished the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen, so much so that they were all standing there stunned.<br>The difference of a single rank in an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill was a disparity in power that was extremely difficult to make up.<br>Thus, how could it be possible for someone to use a rank one Exalted Taboo to take on a rank three Exalted Taboo?<br>This was simply an impossible matter.<br>Yet, this impossible thing happened before their eyes.<br>At the time when the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were all baffled, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke. &ldquo;It would appear that Chu Feng&rsquo;s Exalted Taboo greatly resembles our clan&rsquo;s Exalted Taboo: Black Lightning Attachment.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that his Exalted Taboo is even more profound than ours, and he concealed its strength even better.&rdquo;<br>Hearing their Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s words, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen came to a sudden reaction.<br>They realized what was going on.<br>Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal emitted a white light and appeared to be a rank one Exalted Taboo, it was actually not a rank one Exalted Taboo.<br>Instead, it was very possibly a rank two or even rank three Exalted Taboo.<br>It&rsquo;s just that Chu Feng&rsquo;s Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal was special. Not only had it changed its color, but it had also changed its might. Through that, it was able to confuse others.<br>&ldquo;Truly despicable.&rdquo;<br>Soon, all the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen took what they thought to be the case to be the truth.<br>Then, they actually began to insult Chu Feng.<br>They felt that Chu Feng was using a despicable trick to deceive them.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, there might still be some time before that Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation&rsquo;s power dissipates.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps we should not have young master Daoyi continue to fight that Chu Feng, and instead think of a way to rescue young master Tiancheng?&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Hanxun walked over to the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and spoke quietly.<br>He was actually afraid. He feared that Zuoqiu Daoyi would not be a match for Chu Feng. He feared that their clan&rsquo;s two top geniuses would both be trapped in that Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>It would be one thing if that Chu Feng decided to only torture their two young masters.<br>However, if he were to be crazed enough to directly kill them, it would be an enormous loss to their Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan.<br>It would not be excessive to say that it would be akin to having erased their Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s future.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Daoyi still hasn't used his full strength yet.&rdquo;<br>Compared to Zuoqiu Hanxun, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was extremely confident.<br>He felt that Zuoqiu Daoyi still held victory in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Hanxun was surprised upon hearing those words.<br>However, he soon thought of something.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, could it be that young master Daoyi managed to&hellip;?&rdquo; Zuoqiu Hanxun asked, feeling pleasantly surprised.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief nodded.<br>Seeing this, Zuoqiu Hanxun looked to the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation. The panic in his eyes disappeared, and was replaced with a look of expectation.<br>&ldquo;Do you have any other tricks up your sleeve?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you do, you should use them quickly. Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll be taking care of you,&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice sounded in the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>&ldquo;Take care of me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Arrogant fool, only you will be taken care of.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Zuoqiu Daoyi held his sword with both hands.<br>Then, flames emerged from his body.<br>Not only did the flames cover his entire body, but they also covered the sword in his hands.<br>Soon, the flames soared into the sky and turned into a giant silhouette over ten thousand meters tall.<br>That giant silhouette was Zuoqiu Daoyi.<br>Not only was its outward appearance the same, but even Zuoqiu Daoyi&rsquo;s sword had been copied to the giant.<br>Flames were surging violently through that giant. Merely by looking at it, without even sensing its might, one would be stunned by it.<br>&ldquo;Young master Daoyi actually managed to master that technique!&rdquo;<br>Seeing the change to Zuoqiu Daoyi, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were engulfed by excitement. Unable to contain themselves, they started shouting and cheering.<br>The reason for that was because the flames emitted by Zuoqiu Daoyi were cyan.<br>As members of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan, they knew very well what that ability was.<br>What Zuoqiu Daoyi had used was one of their Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s strongest martial skills, Exalted Taboo: Fiery Cyan Flames!<br>This Exalted Taboo: Fiery Cyan Flames was a rank four Exalted Taboo.<br>There was a restriction on one&rsquo;s cultivation if one wanted to learn a rank four Exalted Taboo.<br>No matter how talented of a genius one might be, one&rsquo;s real cultivation must reach rank four Utmost Exalted before one could learn a rank four Exalted Taboo.<br>If the person trying to learn a rank four Exalted Taboo had mediocre talent, they might have to wait till rank five or rank six Utmost Exalted before they could learn a rank four Exalted Taboo.<br>Yet, Zuoqiu Daoyi actually managed to successfully learn that rank four Exalted Taboo at a rank three Utmost Exalted-level cultivation.<br>This meant that Zuoqiu Daoyi&rsquo;s talent was exceptional, and had reached a point beyond imagination.<br>Most importantly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation earlier was only that of a rank eight Exalted.<br>Even though he had made two successive breakthroughs and become a rank one Utmost Exalted, he had made those breakthroughs just recently.<br>This meant that no matter how talented he might be, he would have no chance to have learned a rank four Exalted Taboo.<br>After all, his cultivation did not meet the requirements needed to learn a rank four Exalted Taboo.<br>As such, he simply possessed no technique that could possibly contend against Zuoqiu Daoyi.<br>After all, the power of a rank four Exalted Taboo far surpassed that of a rank three Exalted Taboo.<br>They were martial skills that only Utmost Exalted could learn.<br>&ldquo;Interesting.&rdquo;<br>Seeing gigantic Zuoqiu Daoyi surging with flames, Chu Feng could sense how powerful that martial skill was.<br>A rank four Exalted Taboo was surely powerful.<br>However, Chu Feng did not fluster before it. Instead, he placed his right hand onto his chest again.<br>&ldquo;This guy, he couldn&rsquo;t possibly&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen all felt disbelief upon witnessing Chu Feng&rsquo;s action.<br>That movement he made was very familiar to them now.<br>After all, he had made that movement twice already.<br>That was the movement Chu Feng made to unleash his Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal.<br>&ldquo;Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal!&rdquo; Chu Feng shouted as he shot forth his right hand explosively.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>As rumbles sounded, light scattered in all directions.<br>The giant hand of light measuring over ten thousand meters appeared again.<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen had guessed correctly.<br>Chu Feng had unleashed that Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal again.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had actually used that Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal again, Zuoqiu Daoyi shouted furiously, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re courting death!&rdquo;<br>He felt that he was being thoroughly looked down on by Chu Feng.<br>As he shouted furiously, the giant flame silhouette turned into flames that covered the entire sky and moved toward Chu Feng explosively.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>The giant hand of light collided with the enormous amount of flames.<br>In an instant, the light and the flames began to wreak havoc.<br>Surging energy ripples covered the entire Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>When the energy ripples began to gradually dissipate, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were all stunned.<br>Not even the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was an exception.<br>Zuoqiu Daoyi was completely uninjured.<br>Yet, Chu Feng was also completely uninjured.<br>Chu Feng had actually really managed to use that Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal to take on Zuoqiu Daoyi&rsquo;s rank four Exalted Taboo!<br>&ldquo;How is this possible?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng actually really used that Exalted Taboo emitting a white light to take on our clan&rsquo;s Exalted Taboo: Fiery Cyan Flames?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly what sort of ability is that? How could it possess such power?&rdquo;<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen realized that Chu Feng&rsquo;s Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal seemed to be even more extraordinary than they imagined it to be.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what rank is that martial skill you used?&rdquo; Zuoqiu Daoyi asked with a stern voice.<br>As matters stood, even he felt that Chu Feng&rsquo;s Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal was an extraordinary technique.<br>&ldquo;A rank one Exalted Taboo,&rdquo; replied Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Say what?&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Daoyi did not dare to believe his ears. He thought he had misheard Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng repeated himself. &ldquo;I said, the martial skill I used earlier is a rank one Exalted Taboo.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
