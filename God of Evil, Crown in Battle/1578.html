        <div> - The Reveal<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Do you still remember the stele that I mentioned? I think what is written on that stele is very likely related to the seemingly dangerous passage on the left.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While the passage on the right is indeed very safe, they will not be able to gain anything by going through that passage. However, if we are to choose the left passage, we will definitely be able to gain rewards.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is because the passage on the left is also a passage that leads to the Immortal Island. The danger that it is revealing right now is only there as a diversionary tactic.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is not just my guess. Instead, it is the conclusion I have come to after careful observation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ve already been in there. The danger of that passage is definitely not there as a diversionary tactic. There are really spirit formations capable of killing people there. They are extremely frightening. The passage on the left is most definitely not something that just appears to be dangerous. Instead, it is actually very dangerous.&rdquo; The Nangong Imperial Clan&rsquo;s people who had gone to probe that passage immediately rejected Chu Feng&rsquo;s theory.<br>&ldquo;If one wishes to obtain profits, one must brave dangers. After all, the sky doesn&rsquo;t rain meat pies.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, what I&rsquo;m going to say to you all is the same. I am only giving you all a suggestion of goodwill. In the end, it will be you all who get to decide which passage to take. Regardless, I am going to be entering this passage.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he said no more and entered the dangerous-looking passage on the left.<br>Tantai Xue did not hesitate and followed Chu Feng into it.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, I&rsquo;m going to follow Chu Feng. I wish to see exactly what sort of thing might be contained in there,&rdquo; Nangong Baihe also ran in. This time around, even though she knew that the left passage was dangerous, she still decided to follow Chu Feng&rsquo;s decision.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going too, I&rsquo;m going too,&rdquo; Nangong Moli also insisted on going. No persuasion was capable of stopping her.<br>Feeling helpless, Nangong Ya followed them into the left passage. However, he could not have the rest of the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan follow them into danger. Thus, he ordered the rest of the Nangong Imperial Clansmen to enter the right passage.<br>In fact, the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan also did not wish to follow them into that sort of danger. Thus, they would naturally not disobey Nangong Ya&rsquo;s command to have them take the safe passage.<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...<br>Originally, Nangong Ya wanted to lead the way, because he felt that he had the highest level of cultivation. However, Chu Feng firmly decided to take the lead.<br>Chu Feng had discovered that the dangerous appearance of this passageway was indeed all fake. This place was in itself a diversion.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng deduced that not only would this path be safe now, it would continue to be safe later. Specifically, there would not be any dangerous beings here.<br>Even if there were actually dangers in this passage, Chu Feng felt that they had definitely not been created by the Weaponry Refinement Immortal. Instead, they were the doings of other people, the doings of those that had came to participate in the Weaponry Bestowment Assembly like Chu Feng&rsquo;s group.<br>If Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess was correct, then the person who had used spirit formations to injure and kill the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan and Beitang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s joint advance party was most likely the person who had taken the stele.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s a spirit formation trap ahead. It&rsquo;s very difficult to get past, and hard to break apart. Likely, someone meticulously set it there,&rdquo; Suddenly, Tantai Xue warned with a very serious tone.<br>She had discovered that before Chu Feng was a spirit formation trap. Furthermore, it should be something that had required quite a lot of time to set up and was very difficult to unravel. Even she did not have the certainty in being able to get past that spirit formation safely.<br>&ldquo;I know. You all, follow me. I guarantee that there won&rsquo;t be an issue.&rdquo;<br>When even Tantai Xue had discovered this trap, Chu Feng had naturally discovered it long ago. This trap had been set meticulously. However, it was greatly inferior to the techniques of the Weaponry Refinement Immortal.<br>Furthermore, this spirit formation trap had not been set up for a long time. Compared to everything else in this passage, the world spirit formation trap was simply not from the same time period.<br>Thus, Chu Feng was even more certain that someone had arrived here before them and set up that trap. The reason why he had done so was so that he could prevent others from entering deep into this passage.<br>Chu Feng became more and more excited. He truly wished to see who it was that would do something this despicable.<br>Following Chu Feng&rsquo;s lead, Tantai Xue and the others really managed to pass through that spirit formation trap safely.<br>After this, Nangong Ya also had a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng. That was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques were extremely profound. At the very least, Nangong Ya knew that he, as a gold-cloak world spiritist, would not have been able to pass through such a powerful world spirit trap so effortlessly.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;Brother Nangong, protect Baihe and Moli. It might be a little problematic later on.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; Nangong Ya was no fool. As matters stood, he had already realized that something fishy was going on here. In fact, he had even guessed that someone must have done something here, and that there would be an unavoidable battle coming up.<br>Thus, before Chu Feng had even said those words to him, he was already following closely behind Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli and kept them within a meter&rsquo;s distance from himself so that he could offer them absolute protection.<br>After Chu Feng&rsquo;s warning, the group continued onward. However, the sky and earth suddenly started shaking. The path ahead and the path behind were both sealed off by golden world spirit formations. In the end, they had still fallen into a trap.<br>At this moment, both Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli were very nervous. That was because when the sealing formation appeared, the two of them realized that their opponent was a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, someone that would be extremely difficult to take care of.<br>However, compared to the two of them, Chu Feng was very calm and collected. That was because Chu Feng had entered the trap deliberately. His purpose was to lure the perpetrator out.<br>&ldquo;Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk ~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truly, there&rsquo;s a road to heaven that you all refuse to take. Hell has no doors, yet you all charged in,&rdquo; Sure enough, a strange voice sounded from outside that spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Hell? Merely a spirit formation that you set up can be considered hell? You are truly overrating yourself, no?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered. His tone contained some mockery.<br>&ldquo;Brat, I know that you have some skills. However, did you really think that someone like you will be able to break through my spirit formation?&rdquo; A voice filled with contempt was heard.<br>&ldquo;Break through your spirit formation? That&rsquo;s truly not hard,&rdquo; Right at this moment, Nangong Ya spoke.<br>At this moment, a golden-bright and dazzling &lsquo;emperor&rsquo; character was flashing on Nangong Ya&rsquo;s forehead. It was his Imperial Bloodline. After Nangong Ya unleashed his Imperial Bloodline, his aura instantly rose from rank three Half Martial Emperor to rank four Half Martial Emperor.<br>After his aura became that of a rank four Half Martial Emperor, he took out a weapon. It was a blue spear. That spear emitted emperor&rsquo;s might. It was an Incomplete Imperial Armament.<br>&ldquo;Mortal Taboo: Violent Dragon Thrust.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Nangong Ya attacked. The spear in his hand trembled and turned into a blue violent dragon. That dragon contained peerless might. Following a loud explosion, it pierced through that spirit formation.<br>At this moment, not to mention others, even Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes shone. This Nangong Ya&rsquo;s true battle strength was comparable to that of a rank seven Martial Emperor. He was truly a genius of the Nangong Imperial Clan. Indeed, he was extremely powerful. At the very least, he was more powerful than the current Chu Feng. Unless Chu Feng had Eggy come out and fight, otherwise the current him would be no match for Nangong Ya.<br>&ldquo;Tsk tsk, Nangong Ya, you progress at quite the lightning speed indeed. You&rsquo;ve surpassed my imagination. However, you are still too inexperienced to fight against me.&rdquo;<br>After that spirit formation was broken through, a figure appeared floating in the air. It was an old man. He was wearing a crimson gown. However, most importantly, that old man had an appearance akin to a ghost. He was truly frightening.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually you?&rdquo; Upon seeing this person, even Nangong Ya&rsquo;s expression changed. A deep sense of shock appeared in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Tsk tsk, my dear disciple, shouldn&rsquo;t you be kneeling upon seeing your master?&rdquo; The man said with a sneer.<br></p></div>
