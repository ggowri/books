        <div>: The Disappeared Undying Starfield<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You are really&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had no idea what to say to Long Xiaoxiao, but he was fond of how obedient she was. He still didn&rsquo;t harbor affection for her, but her standing in his heart had started undergoing some changes.<br>He brought Long Xiaoxiao to an ancient teleportation formation. He was intending to bring her to a place that was still in the Holy Light Galaxy but wasn&rsquo;t part of the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s territory&mdash;an Ordinary Realm in the Undying Starfield known as Flowersea Ordinary Realm.<br>Back when Chu Feng was in the Reincarnation Upper Realm, he found out that an extremely formidable figure had once risen from the All-heaven Starfield back in the Ancient Era. That person was known as the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor, and he was buried in the Reincarnation Upper Realm after his death.<br>Chu Feng ventured into the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s tomb together with the Mystic Cave Saints, where he met the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s fragmented soul.<br>He received the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s acknowledgment and his Monstrous Slaying Sword.<br>It was just that his real inheritance wasn&rsquo;t in that tomb but the Undying Starfield&rsquo;s Flowersea Ordinary Realm.<br>The key to unlocking the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s treasure there was the Monstrous Slaying Sword.<br>It was just that before the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s fragment soul dissipated, he reminded Chu Feng that he had to at least reach Martial Exalted level before heading there. That was also the reason why Chu Feng had never gone there.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t because he didn&rsquo;t want to but he wasn&rsquo;t strong enough yet.<br>However, he was sufficiently strong now.<br>Given how powerful the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor was, Chu Feng would surely grow much stronger if he could obtain his heritage.<br>To be honest, he wasn&rsquo;t confident about facing the Holy Light Clan with his current strength. However, he would stand a better chance at victory if he could obtain the heritage.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re heading to the Undying Starfield?&rdquo;<br>While Chu Feng was setting the location on the ancient teleportation formation, Long Xiaoxiao suddenly spoke up.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Have you been there before?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Despite the Undying Starfield&rsquo;s domineering name, it was actually a Lower Starfield. It was stronger than the Ancestral Martial Starfield, which was an Abandoned Starfield, but it was still not a place that someone of Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s standing would care about.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been there before. However, if you&rsquo;re heading there, does it mean that you have friends there?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart clenched up.<br>He noticed that there was something wrong with Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s face and tone, as if she was extremely worried about something.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any friends there, but I do have an important reason for heading there. Could it be that something happened to the Undying Starfield?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the important reason?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked anxiously.<br>Her reaction was making Chu Feng feel uneasy.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a tomb there that might allow me to eradicate the Holy Light Clan if I can obtain its heritage,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied honestly.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s really a coincidence. Is it possible that someone else has discovered the tomb you&rsquo;re speaking of?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked worriedly.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, are you saying that someone else has already headed to the Flowersea Ordinary Realm?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than that. Just a few days ago, the entire Undying Starfield vanished,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao replied.<br>&ldquo;The Undying Starfield vanished? What do you mean?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It was completely erased from existence. A few days ago, a huge phenomenon appeared in the Holy Light Galaxy. Numerous hands suddenly appeared in the direction of the Undying Starfield. Those hands were humongous enough to crush an entire world flat. They could be clearly seen even in the starry night sky.<br>&ldquo;The hands appeared for just a short period of time, but many people saw them. Initially, we thought that it was just a phenomenon, but news soon spread that the Undying Starfield has disappeared,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked.<br>&ldquo;To think that something like that happened! Could it be that a powerful expert has discovered the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s heritage?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured with a deep frown.<br>How powerful must those existences be to actually make an entire starfield vanish?<br>It was unlikely that this incident was related to the Holy Light Clan since they wouldn&rsquo;t have the power to pull off such a feat. It was likely to be the deed of a powerhouse in this massive world of cultivation.<br>To the current Chu Feng, those figures were no different from gods.<br>Even Shengguang Xuanye would be completely helpless against such existences.<br>Given so, it was probably impossible for him to obtain the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s heritage now.<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Yunyue might know something more about it,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao suddenly said.<br>&ldquo;Right! How did I forget about her?&rdquo;<br>The Holy Light Clan was bound to investigate this matter considering that they were the rulers of the galaxy. Shengguang Yunyue, as a grand elder of the Holy Light Clan, was bound to get firsthand information of the investigation result.<br>So, Chu Feng brought the bound Shengguang Yunyue out of the gourd to ask about that matter.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, a powerful expert probably discovered a formidable treasure in the Undying Starfield and made a move. Our Holy Light Clan doesn&rsquo;t know who the culprit is, and we dare not probe too deeply into it either. It might backfire on us if we put our heads where it doesn&rsquo;t belong.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already told you what I know, so don&rsquo;t torture me over this!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Yunyue seemed to have already been traumatized by Chu Feng. She called Chu Feng &lsquo;young hero&rsquo; and spoke in a humble tone.<br>&ldquo;Is there no clue at all?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>His tone wasn&rsquo;t particularly severe, but it still sent a jolt through Shengguang Yunyue&rsquo;s body.<br>&ldquo;I-I just recalled something! There was indeed a discovery, but we don&rsquo;t know whether it has something to do with the phenomenon or not!&rdquo; Shengguang Yunyue said anxiously.<br>&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; Chu Feng said impatiently.<br>&ldquo;Right before the Undying Starfield vanished, there were reports of cultivators wearing identical clothes being spotted in the vicinity. It was peculiar because those clothes didn&rsquo;t belong to any power in the Holy Light Galaxy, and they disappeared without a trace after the Undying Starfield vanished,&rdquo; Shengguang Yunyue said.<br>&ldquo;Describe their clothing!&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He felt that those people had something to do with this incident.<br>&ldquo;They are dressed in a red robe and a white straw hat. The words &lsquo;Netherworld Envoy&rsquo; are embroidered in black on their robes,&rdquo; Shengguang Yunyue said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s them?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured with a frown.<br></p></div>
