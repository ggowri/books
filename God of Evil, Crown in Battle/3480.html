        <div> - Becoming An Utmost Exalted Within Ten Years<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve wasted this exalted one&rsquo;s efforts. Drop dead.&rdquo;<br>Right after those words were said, boundless killing intent rushed out from the depths of the hidden path.<br>At that moment, both Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie felt that they&rsquo;d set one foot into the gates of hell.<br>Their opponent possessed power that they were incapable of rivaling. If it wanted to kill them, only death would await Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie.<br>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Sensing that the situation had turned bad, Chu Feng hurriedly spoke, &ldquo;Senior, please wait! This junior has something to say!&rdquo;<br>Although the killing intent did not disappear, the existence in the hidden path below actually ended up speaking. That said, its voice was filled with impatience, &ldquo;What do you want to say? Spit it out quickly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, was that abnormal sign in the sky caused by you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;What if it was and what if it wasn&rsquo;t? What does it have to do with you?&rdquo; That being became vile. Contempt toward Chu Feng filled its tone.<br>Suddenly, Chu feng sighed.<br>&ldquo;Why are you sighing?&rdquo; That existence asked.<br>&ldquo;This junior is very disappointed,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Disappointed? Since when is it time for you to be disappointed? The one to be disappointed is this exalted one,&rdquo; that existence replied.<br>&ldquo;Before this junior entered this place, I had sensed a pair of eyes hidden within the abnormal sign staring at me the entire time. Later on, I heard that the appearance of the abnormal sign was meant to choose a child chosen by the heavens. Because of that, I thought I must be the chosen individual. That is the reason why I decided to enter this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, I never expected that senior would hold me in such contempt after seeing me. If I had known that would be the case, I wouldn&rsquo;t have come in.&rdquo; Chu Feng sighed again.<br>&ldquo;A pair of eyes were staring at you? Are you serious?&rdquo; However, after hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, that being&rsquo;s tone suddenly changed. It who was originally filled with impatience began to question Chu Feng about details regarding the pair of eyes nonstop.<br>As for Chu Feng, he began to truthfully tell that existence of all that he felt.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited for so many years without it choosing anyone to come in. Now that it has finally chosen someone, it actually chose someone this weak? Nine Dragons Sage, are you toying with this exalted one?&rdquo; That existence below muttered in confusion.<br>&ldquo;Senior, could it be that the pair of eyes that were staring at me belonged to the Nine Dragons Sage, and not you senior?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That has nothing to do with you,&rdquo; that existence replied.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine if senior doesn&rsquo;t wish to inform me. However, you must tell this junior why you all chose me to come in here. No matter what it might be, this junior will have to give it a try, no? If this junior is truly incapable of it, it wouldn&rsquo;t be too late for senior to kill me then,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brat, you&rsquo;re quite courageous and insightful. You clearly know that this exalted one planned to kill you, yet you still dared to ask about all this. Although your cultivation is very weak, you&rsquo;ve made this exalted one have a slight change in his impression of you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, your current cultivation is simply too weak. You should go and train some more. You can return to find me once you&rsquo;ve become an Utmost Exalted,&rdquo; that existence said.<br>&ldquo;If that is the case, then it would be good too. Merely, senior, this junior does not know much about this place. I do not know how to get out from here. Senior, could you show me the way out?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This exalted one is able to bring you out. Merely&hellip; if you plan to leave, you will have to leave something behind. Otherwise, if you do not return, wouldn&rsquo;t this exalted one end up being toyed with by you?&rdquo; said that existence.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I must bring my friend out with me,&rdquo; Chu Feng sensed that the situation was bad and immediately stood closer to Wuma Shengjie.<br>&ldquo;That brat is even more trash than you. Why would this exalted one keep him? What this exalted one wants to keep is that egg in your hand,&rdquo; that being said.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; after hearing those words, Chu Feng tossed the Qilin&rsquo;s Egg in his hand out without any hesitation.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you!!!&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie was stunned upon witnessing that scene.<br>That Qilin&rsquo;s Egg was capable of devouring Evil Spirits. It was most definitely a priceless treasure. Yet, Chu Feng tossed it away without the slightest hesitation.<br>How could Chu Feng not know how valuable the Qilin&rsquo;s Egg was? However, no matter how valuable it might be, it was still only a treasure, and simply incomparable to Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s and his lives.<br>&ldquo;When this exalted one said that you must leave something behind, your first reaction was that you could not leave your friend. When this exalted one wanted your egg, you immediately handed it over without any hesitation. I can tell that you are one who cares for your friends a lot. Not bad. This exalted one is starting to appreciate you even more, brat.&rdquo;<br>After that being obtained the Qilin&rsquo;s Egg, it actually started laughing. Furthermore, its laughter was rather delightful. It could be seen that the hidden existence&rsquo;s mood had improved a lot.<br>&ldquo;Senior, in that case, can this junior leave now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; after that being finished saying those words, a spirit formation gate appeared before Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie.<br>Both Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie were overjoyed to see that spirit formation gate. This place was simply akin to hell. They were truly impatient to leave.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a rush to leave just yet. This exalted one is not really fond of you leaving this egg with me just like that. I am someone who is fond of fair deals. How about this: this exalted one will also leave a treasure with you,&rdquo; that being said all of a sudden.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you don&rsquo;t have to. This junior will feel very apologetic should you do that,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother with the formalities. Here, have it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>After those words were said, a crimson ray of light suddenly shot forth from within the depths of the hidden path, straight into Chu Feng&rsquo;s dantian.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>After that crimson ray of light entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, Chu Feng was immediately met with intense pain. Then, crimson veins filled his body. It was a very terrifying sight.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng,&rdquo; seeing that, Wuma Shengjie was extremely frightened. She immediately went over to support him.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic. The treasure will have a slight reaction since it has just entered your body. You will be fine soon,&rdquo; that being said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this junior is truly unable to enjoy this treasure of yours. It is best that you take it back,&rdquo; Chu Feng said while clenching his teeth in pain.<br>The reason why Chu Feng said that was because he had realized that the thing that was entering his body was simply not a treasure at all. Instead, it was a fatal poison.<br>That being was clearly afraid that Chu Feng would not return. That was why it decided to poison him, so as to force him to return.<br>&ldquo;I never said that I wanted you to enjoy my treasure. After all, you will have to return it to me in the future. Reach the Utmost Exalted realm within ten years&rsquo; time, and return to this place to find this exalted one. With that, this exalted one will retrieve the treasure from your body.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Let me remind you of this. This exalted one&rsquo;s treasure is quite intense. It&rsquo;s best that you don't try to seek out those trash world spiritists to help you remove it. Otherwise, you shall have to bear the consequences.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now then, you can go.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will take my leave then.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body shifted. He grabbed Wuma Shengjie and entered that spirit formation gate with her.<br>&ldquo;Huu, huu, huu~~~&rdquo;<br>After entering the spirit formation gate, Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie were immediately sucked into an enormously powerful current.<br>It was a spirit formation channel. The current within the spirit formation channel was extremely powerful. Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie were simply unable to move at all, and could only follow the current.<br>&ldquo;How could this resemble an exit at all? Could it be deceiving us?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie asked.<br>&ldquo;If it had wanted to kill us, it would have been able to do so effortlessly. If it wanted to force us to do anything, we wouldn't be able to resist it either. Thus, there's no need for it to deceive us,&rdquo; compared to Wuma Shengjie, Chu Feng was rather calm.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you alright?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie asked concernedly.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. I believe that nothing will happen to me within ten years&rsquo; time,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>Seeing Chu Feng like that, Wuma Shengjie didn&rsquo;t know what to say, and started feeling even more upset.<br>&ldquo;How could you hand over that Qilin&rsquo;s Egg, something that precious, just like that?&rdquo; she asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s merely a Qilin&rsquo;s Egg. How could it be as precious as our lives?&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke with an expression of indifference.<br>Hearing those words, Wuma Shengjie felt even greater heartache. After all, she had witnessed Chu Feng shielding her in the first instant, and declaring that she could not be the one to be left behind.<br>Countless people would fight and kill one another for the sake of a treasure. They would even become enemies with the people closest to them.<br>Yet, Chu Feng was able to give up priceless treasures without the slightest hesitation, and would instead risk his life to protect his friend. This made Wuma Shengjie feel an intense warmth at the same time as she felt heartache.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I am truly incomparable to you,&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie muttered softly.<br>&ldquo;Why would you suddenly say that sort of nonsense?&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to Wuma Shengjie with astonishment and deep concern.<br>&ldquo;Ever since we encountered the Evil Spirits, fear filled my heart. When we encountered that unknown existence, I was so scared that I became speechless. If it wasn&rsquo;t for you, I would&rsquo;ve likely already died,&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie said.<br>&ldquo;Foolish girl, I&rsquo;ve only done what I should do. It is a matter of course for a man to protect a woman. Besides, you&rsquo;re my friend,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled and patted Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s shoulder.<br>Had it been before, Wuma Shengjie would immediately avoid him. However, this time around, she did not.<br>In the past, she had detested being touched by men. However, when Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand landed on her shoulder this time around, she felt a sense of security that she had never felt before.<br></p></div>
