        <h1>Chapter 3498</h1>
        <div> - The Terrifying Chu Xuanyuan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Linghu Yuhua mentioned the name Chu Feng, Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s expression suddenly twisted. He immediately grabbed his chest.<br>At that moment, not only did he have an extremely pained expression on his face, but his body was also shivering violently.<br>&ldquo;Hongfei,&rdquo; Seeing that, Linghu Yuhua hurriedly supported Linghu Hongfei.<br>A faint light was being emitted from Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s chest. When the light disappeared, bean-sized beads of cold sweat covered Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s face. His complexion was paper pale, and his aura extremely weak.<br>That said, both Linghu Hongfei and Linghu Yuhua had anticipated this.<br>Linghu Hongfei finally released his hand that was tightly grabbing his chest. There was actually a stone in his palm.<br>That stone was only the size of a fingernail. Yet, it was pulsing and flickering with a faint blue light, as if it were alive. From a glance, one could tell that the stone was not an ordinary item. Unfortunately, the stone was currently shattered.<br>&ldquo;Snap~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Linghu Hongfei clenched his palm and crushed the stone completely.<br>His body started to tremble even more violently. It was no longer caused by his injury. Instead, he was trembling from anger, endless anger.<br>Seeing Linghu Hongfei like that, Linghu Yuhua revealed a look of pain.<br>It was common knowledge that the Linghu Heavenly Clan had assimilated the Cyan Nethersoul with Linghu Hongfei when he was born.<br>However, they didn&rsquo;t know that the Linghu Heavenly Clan had assimilated another item into Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s body before the Cyan Nethersoul.<br>The worth of that item was not at all inferior to the Cyan Nethersoul. As for that item, it was the stone that Linghu Hongfei took from his chest and then crushed to pieces. Its name was the Life-protector Soulstone.<br>The Life-protector Soulstone was capable of saving Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s life once.<br>The reason why the Linghu Heavenly Clan had assimilated the Life-protector Soulstone with Linghu Hongfei before the Cyan Nethersoul was because they were worried that he might fail the assimilation with the Cyan Nethersoul and end up having his consciousness seized by it.<br>Merely, no one had expected for his willpower to be so strong that he would easily subdue the Cyan Nethersoul.<br>Thus, from the day he was born, not only did he possess the Cyan Nethersoul, a power from the Ancient Era, but he also had an extra life.<br>Merely, no one would&rsquo;ve imagined that the Life-protector Soulstone that had accompanied Linghu Hongfei all his life since the moment he was born would be shattered.<br>Furthermore, it was shattered by a person of the younger generation with a cultivation that was much weaker than his own.<br>As for that person, he was Chu Feng.<br>Linghu Yuhua was able to imagine how Chu Feng was capable of such a feat. Likely, it was that grand formation Chu Feng had set up, the spirit formation that Chu Feng called the Octoforms Lightning Sealing Formation.<br>After that spirit formation was used, Linghu Hongfei was completely sealed and thoroughly suppressed. He was simply incapable of breaching that spirit formation.<br>In that situation, he had only had two options. He could either admit defeat, or enter a life and death struggle.<br>Linghu Hongfei had chosen the latter.<br>Thus, he had sacrificed the extra life that had accompanied him since birth, the Life-protector Soulstone.<br>To Linghu Hongfei, that was an extremely painful decision.<br>However, he had no choice but to do it. He couldn&rsquo;t possibly allow himself to be defeated by Chu Feng like that before all those people. If that were to happen, he would not be able to establish himself in the Ancestral Martial Starfield anymore.<br>Furthermore, Linghu Hongfei felt that he was merely careless, and that he would definitely be able to defeat Chu Feng should he be given another chance.<br>Although the price for a second chance would be the Life-protector Soulstone, he had felt that it was worth it.<br>Merely, he had never imagined; no one had ever imagined, that Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques would have reached such a terrifying level.<br>His world spirit techniques had far surpassed his martial power.<br>A rank one Exalted-level world spirit was actually able to force Linghu Hongfei to unleash all the abilities that he had. Yet, in the end, he was still unable to gain victory.<br>A tie?<br>That was not the result that Linghu Hongfei wanted. Yet, it was the ultimate outcome of the match.<br>After paying the price of the Life-protector Soulstone, he was only able to gain a tie in the match. To Linghu Hongfei, it was no different than being defeated.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please tell me the truth. Am I truly inferior to Chu Xuanyuan?&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei asked.<br>&ldquo;Hongfei, it is not necessary for one to compare oneself to another person one&rsquo;s entire life. It would serve as the best progress as long as you continue to make breakthroughs nonstop,&rdquo; said Linghu Yuhua.<br>&ldquo;While it is possible for me to not compare myself to others, if I want to become the strongest person in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, I cannot avoid being compared to him,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please tell me the truth. Back then, was Chu Xuanyuan really stronger than me?&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei looked to Linghu Yuhua with a gaze filled with longing for an answer.<br>He not only wanted an answer, he also wanted to remove the knot in his heart that had troubled him for many years.<br>Seeing Linghu Hongfei like that, Linghu Yuhua was unable to lie to him anymore.<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s performance back then surpassed even his father, Chu Hanxian. His son, Chu Feng, is also unable to compare to him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not to mention the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, likely in the entire Holy Light Galaxy, there has never been a person as powerful as Chu Xuanyuan,&rdquo; Linghu Yuhua said.<br>Hearing those words, Linghu Hongfei did not say anything. However, the light in his eyes had instantly disappeared. He seemed to have lost his soul.<br>However, immediately after, Linghu Hongfei heaved a long sigh of relief.<br>It was as if he had finally let go of an enormous stone that has been crushing him, and became much more relaxed.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, I had been deceiving myself the entire time,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei smiled bitterly and shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Hongfei, within a hundred years of age, no matter what you do, you will not be able to surpass Chu Xuanyuan. However, the future is long, and it is still hard to say what will happen then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, Chu Xuanyuan is not as fortunate as you are. Like him, you shine brilliantly, and have long been seen as a thorn by the Starfield Master Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, standing behind you is the Linghu Heavenly Clan, Even the Starfield Master Realm does not dare to touch you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, it was different for Chu Xuanyuan. Although he was matchlessly brilliant, the Chu Heavenly Clan is unbearably weak.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because he did not have any backing, Chu Xuanyuan was forced to escape from the Ancestral Martial Starfield at a young age. Upon his return, he was immediately met with threats from the Starfield Master Realm. Helpless, he ended up being imprisoned by his own clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Reportedly, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s forbidden area is capable of weakening his cultivation. Chu Xuanyuan is no longer a threat to the Starfield Master Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While it is true that he was born with matchless brilliance, and that no one could even be compared to him, he ended up suffering a miserable end.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;His martial cultivation path has long since reached its end, whereas yours is just starting.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, Hongfei, you do not have to cling to his past achievements. After all, in the future, you will definitely surpass Chu Xuanyuan,&rdquo; Linghu Yuhua said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you don&rsquo;t have to try to deceive me. Is Chu Xuanyuan really not a threat to the Starfield Master Realm anymore?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that really were the case, Lord Clan Chief would not have dispatched people to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm to search for him, no?&rdquo; said Linghu Hongfei.<br>Hearing those words, Linghu Yuhua&rsquo;s expression changed slightly, &ldquo;Hongfei, where did you learn of this matter?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, not only have I heard about it, but I have also heard that after our clansmen reached the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s forbidden area, they were unable to even meet Chu Xuanyuan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the reason why, it was because there was a barrier there. That barrier was so powerful that not a single person from our clan could breach it,&rdquo; said Linghu Hongfei.<br></p></div>
