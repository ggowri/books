        <h1>Chapter 5740: I Missed You to Death</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who emerged from the teleportation formation was a familiar face&mdash;Long Chengyu.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Long Chengyu is still alive? Wasn&rsquo;t there a revolt in the Totem Dragon Clan?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd discussed fervently amongst themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, an uproar broke out in the Pulse Ignition Village. There was a change in the ranking board. Long Chengyu had replaced Qin Shu as the tenth place in the test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Long Chengyu?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was taken aback to see that name, especially those from the upper echelons of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Long Lin actually let Long Chengyu go?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew what had happened to the Totem Dragon Clan, and their intention was to pluck out the root of the trouble lest it bite back at them. However, Long Lin insisted on imprisoning the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others, saying that he had a use for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Long Chengyu was here meant that Long Lin had deceived them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they had secretly helped Long Lin stage a revolt within the Totem Dragon Clan, they saw him as nothing more than a puppet. Needless to say, they had to teach their puppet a lesson for daring to defy their will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith, there was not a single person who stepped forward to greet Long Chengyu. On the one hand, Long Chengyu wasn&rsquo;t fond of making friends, so he was not on close terms with anyone here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, most people would take the initiative to befriend him, given his fame and identity. However, things were different now due to the change in his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Long Chengyu had survived the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s rebellion, there was no question that he had lost clout. On top of that, most people in the world of cultivation knew that he was on close terms with Chu Feng, and Chu Feng had offended the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even the previous Totem Dragon Clan dared to offend the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, let alone the current Long Chengyu. Similarly, no one here in the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith wanted to make an enemy out of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, no one dared to approach Long Chengyu.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, two little monks from the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith walked up to Long Chengyu and said, &ldquo;Congratulations on getting to the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith. We have specially prepared a place of respite for you. Please follow us.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Give me a moment. I&rsquo;m waiting for two people,&rdquo; Long Chengyu replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; The two little monks nodded before backing to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s waiting for two people? Are the other juniors from the Totem Dragon Clan here too?&rdquo; the crowd speculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, the teleportation formation lit up once more, and a woman walked out from within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span>?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned. In particular, Qin Shu looked at her with complicated eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> was famous in the world of cultivation, for a long time, there had been hardly anyone in the Totem Dragon Clan who had seen her real face, let alone outsiders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first time the world saw Long </span><span>Muxi&rsquo;s</span><span> true face was in Painter Mountain, and her portraits quickly spread across the world of cultivation. More and more people came to learn of her true appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Shu had met Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> before in the Ancient Realm, just that none of them knew her identity back then. Their reunion reminded him of the affairs that had happened then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> didn&rsquo;t get on the ranking board, so no one outside knew that she had entered the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, everyone outside widened their eyes in shock. There was another change in the ranking board, or rather, the entire ranking board had changed. Someone had taken first place, pushing the others down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Chu Feng! His name had appeared in first place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng? He&hellip; isn&rsquo;t dead?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s name caused a larger stir. Most people were convinced he was dead, but not only was he alive, but he even took first place in the test!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master, who had already known that Chu Feng was alive, was infuriated when he saw the ranking board. He clenched his fists in anger. He was the number one person in the world who didn&rsquo;t want to see Chu Feng in the limelight, but the latter actually slipped into the first place in the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith under his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he not be angry?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a huge commotion broke out in the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng had stepped out of the teleportation formation to enter the square. The juniors gathered here were also shocked to learn that Chu Feng was alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Shu glared at Chu Feng with eyes burning with hatred, as his lips curled into a sneer. He still remembered their grudge from the Ancient Realm. He thought that there was no chance for him to exact vengeance but who could have thought that an opportunity would present itself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big brother.&rdquo; Qin Shu looked at Qin Xuan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the time to make a move yet,&rdquo; Qin Xuan replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you afraid of Long Chengyu?&rdquo; Qin Shu asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of him, but we should keep a lookout first. There are people from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion here too. We don&rsquo;t need to rush into things,&rdquo; Qin Xuan replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Putting aside Ling Xiao and Jie </span><span>Baobao</span><span>, there&rsquo;s Jie Tian too. He is the real grandson of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master. There&rsquo;s no way he could tolerate Chu Feng&rsquo;s existence. There&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;ll walk out of here alive.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An expectant gleam flashed across Qin Shu&rsquo;s eyes. He wasn&rsquo;t worried even though Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> and Long Chengyu were exchanging pleasantries with Chu Feng. In his view, Chu Feng was a goner for crossing the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Putting aside the fact there were three formidable prodigies from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion here, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was also on good terms with other powers. Most powers would offer a helping hand if the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion requested for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Chengyu was already in a precarious position; he was in no position to protect Chu Feng. The only way for him to survive this ordeal was to turn against Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you were so arrogant in the Ancient Realm that you dared to make light of our Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect. Very well! I&rsquo;ll show you the standing of our Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect. You shall see the influence we wield!&rdquo; Qin Shu clenched his fists in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a sweet voice echoed, &ldquo;Chu Feng!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A person charged up to Chu Feng. It was Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span>? Are they acquainted?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that the two of them knew each other from Xian </span><span>Miaomiao&rsquo;s</span><span> bright smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Miaomiao</span><span>.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was overjoyed to see Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> too. He didn&rsquo;t think that they would reunite under such circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I heard many rumors about you since arriving here. I thought something bad had happened to you. I guess rumors are rumors, after all,&rdquo; Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was truly worried about Chu Feng. Despite her sweet smile, tears had started streaming down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Silly girl. Why are you crying? What could possibly happen to me?&rdquo; Chu Feng reached out and wiped Xian </span><span>Miaomiao&rsquo;s</span><span> tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> didn&rsquo;t reject his touch. Instead, she tilted her head as her smile further brightened. &ldquo;Those are tears of joy.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Damn! He&rsquo;s able to touch her as he pleases? Why does Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> not reject him?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s their relationship?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was perplexed to see how intimate the two of them were. Qin Shu also lost his previous excitement. He could tell that Chu Feng and Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> were close to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Look, </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> is coming out!&rdquo; a voice exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd quickly turned their attention toward </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s</span><span> residence, where they saw her glowing red name had been extinguished, indicating that she was leaving her residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s</span><span> had long made a name for herself in the world of cultivation. She was known not just for her beauty but her talent too, which was rumored to be above that of her older brother. However, few people had ever seen </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s</span><span> face before, so the crowd looked forward to seeing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wanted to know if she was as beautiful as the rumors put her out to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a beautiful figure emerged from the fog. It was Little Fishy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Heavens above! Is that </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>? The rumors don&rsquo;t do her justice at all. She&rsquo;s as beautiful as a fairy!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd, be it men or women, was enchanted by her beauty. Her appearance and </span><span>disposition were flawless. Even the ravishing Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> paled in comparison to </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>. She was like the moon&mdash;her very presence dulled the other stars sharing the sky with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;To think there&rsquo;s such beauty in the world.&rdquo; Even Qin Shu had forgotten the anger he had felt from Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> and Chu Feng&rsquo;s intimacy. He was infatuated with </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s</span><span> beauty. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d have been a worthwhile life if I could share a night with such a ravishing woman.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Qin Shu thought about it, the more excited he felt. He even began salivating, only to freeze in shock the next moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> saw Chu Feng, she vanished into thin air. By the time she reappeared, she had already leaped into Chu Feng&rsquo;s embrace, wrapping her arms around his neck. Not only that, she also nuzzled against Chu Feng&rsquo;s chest with her beautiful face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big brother, I knew that you would be fine!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Long Chengyu, Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span>, and Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> were shocked beyond words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Why would </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do they know each other?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How could a countryside bumpkin like Chu Feng possibly be acquainted with someone as noble as </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This shocking turn of events dealt a critical blow to the crowd. They could still somewhat accept that Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> and Chu Feng were acquainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>? How could this be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the purest existence in the world of cultivation, the goddess </span><span>that prodigies</span><span> like them dreamed about. How could she be so intimate with Chu Feng?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng!!!&rdquo; a voice suddenly echoed from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The noisy square immediately fell silent. It was </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span>, the person thought to be the strongest junior in the current world of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like you&rsquo;re going to die without the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion making a move.&rdquo; Qin Shu breathed a sigh of relief upon seeing </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span>, thinking that Chu Feng was dead meat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> allow someone like Chu Feng to defile his younger sister?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many others shared the same thought as well. Even Long Chengyu quickly stood at attention, fearing that </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> would attempt to hurt Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> vanished on the spot too, and by the time he reappeared, he was already standing in front of Chu Feng. He first dragged </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span> away from Chu Feng before diving into Chu Feng&rsquo;s arms himself to give the latter a tight hug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I missed you to death!!!&rdquo;</span></p></div>
