        <div> - A Sight Of Grievance<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng knew that something major had happened upon hearing Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s voice.<br>Sure enough, something major did happen.<br>It turned out that it was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and his condition.<br>Not even Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng, the two Saint-cloak World Spiritists, were able to stabilize his condition.<br>They needed Chu Feng&rsquo;s assistance.<br>As the matter concerned the life and death of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Chu Feng did not dare to hesitate, and immediately rushed over to where the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was being treated.<br>Once he entered, Grandmaster Liangqiu immediately set up a spirit formation.<br>After setting up the spirit formation, Grandmaster Liangqiu ordered that even if the heavens were to collapse, no one was to disturb them. Otherwise, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would end up dying.<br>After hearing what Grandmaster Liangqiu said, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others realized how serious their Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s condition was.<br>However, there was nothing they could do. After all, they were unable to help in the matter.<br>They could only place their hopes on Grandmaster Liangqiu, Liangqiu Chengfeng, and Chu Feng.<br>Thus, apart from complying with Grandmaster Liangqiu and sealing that place, there was nothing they could do.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s situation is extremely bad.&rdquo; Chu Lingxi also had a serious look on her face.<br>She had grown up in the Chu Heavenly Clan. Thus, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was like a grandfather to her. She was very close to him.<br>As such, she would naturally not hope for anything to happen to him.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief is worthy of heaven's help. He should be fine.&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa comforted her.<br>&ldquo;Milord, the situation is bad!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, an expert from the Law Enforcement Hall rushed in in a panic.<br>At that moment, nervousness filled his face. He had the look of someone facing impending doom.<br>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Linghu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; replied that expert.<br>&ldquo;Linghu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s expressions changed upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;Linghu Hongfei has arrived with the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s experts. They mentioned Chu Feng by name and demanded to challenge him," said that expert.<br>&ldquo;Challenge Chu Feng?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa frowned upon hearing those words.<br>What was the Linghu Heavenly Clan? They were an existence currently engaged in a battle against the Starfield Master Realm for the spot of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s overlord position.<br>It would not be excessive to say that they were the strongest power in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>And now, such a power had come to cause trouble. How exactly was he supposed to handle them?<br>Even if Gu Mingyuan was present, she would likely not be able to hold them off either.<br>&ldquo;They came this quickly?&rdquo;<br>Compared to Chu Xuanzhengfa, Chu Lingxi reacted as if she had anticipated it.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s body shifted. She headed outside the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, what are you doing?&rdquo; asked Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>&ldquo;Father, they&rsquo;ve come to challenge us. How can we cower before them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since Chu Feng is unable to accept the challenge, I will take on this so-called number one genius Linghu Hongfei on his behalf.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Lingxi spoke, her figure disappeared. Only her voice still resonated in the sky.<br>Even though her voice was filled with confidence, Chu Xuanzhengfa was still extremely worried for her. Thus, his body shifted, and he rushed after her.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>After Chu Feng entered the palace hall used for the treatment of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, he gave his all to cooperate with Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Once they began, they continued the treatment for three entire days.<br>After three days passed, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s condition had finally stabilized.<br>Even though the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was still unconscious and needed to be slowly nursed back to health, he was at least no longer in fatal danger.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, this kindness is not something that I can thank you enough for. But, I must still thank seniors for this kindness.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng bowed to Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng.<br>Chu Feng knew very well that it could be said that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was only able to live because Grandmaster Liangqiu had forcibly pulled him back from the gates of the afterlife.<br>What he had done was truly a grace of saving one&rsquo;s life.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu sighed, then said, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, this is only something that this old man should do. Based on our relationship, I cannot disregard your clan chief&rsquo;s life and death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, you yourself have helped enormously in the treatment. If you weren&rsquo;t here, your clan chief would not have been able to survive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what my master said is correct. In terms of contribution, your contributions cannot go unnoticed,&rdquo; Liangqiu Chengfeng added.<br>Facing those two people, Chu Feng felt endlessly moved. He could only say, &ldquo;Chu Feng will definitely repay seniors&rsquo; kindness and grace.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s enough. Your clansmen must be worried about your clan chief. You should go out and report this good news to them,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Chu Feng immediately got up upon hearing those words.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu waved his sleeve and removed the spirit formation that covered the palace hall.<br>When the spirit formation disappeared, Chu Feng discovered Chu Xuanzhengfa was standing outside the gate.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa had entered the palace. Merely, he did not dare to disturb Grandmaster Liangqiu, Liangqiu Chengfeng and Chu Feng. That was why he was standing outside the spirit formation.<br>However, Chu Xuanzhengfa had an extremely pale look on his face. Worry was written all over his visibly pale face.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how is Lord Clan Chief?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa stepped forth and asked. His voice was filled with nervousness.<br>This was the first time Chu Feng had seen Chu Xuanzhengfa like that.<br>&ldquo;Senior, Lord Clan Chief has escaped danger. He will be able to recover with time,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Chu Feng finished saying those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa suddenly knelt on the ground.<br>He began to kowtow to Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng were bewildered by Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s actions. Confused, they turned their gazes to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng had originally thought that Chu Xuanzhengfa was acting this way because he wanted to thank Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng for saving their Lord Clan Chief.<br>However, after Chu Xuanzhengfa spoke, Chu Feng realized that the situation was amiss.<br>&ldquo;Milords, you two have saved my Lord Clan Chief. You&rsquo;ve already shown us enormous grace.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Originally, I shouldn&rsquo;t trouble you two at a time like this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, my daughter is seriously injured. I truly have no choice but to seek seniors&rsquo; help in saving my daughter.&rdquo;<br>Not only was Chu Xuanzhengfa kowtowing nonstop, he was even weeping bitter tears as he said those words. He seemed like he was about to collapse.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what happened to Lingxi?&rdquo;<br>After learning that something had happened to Chu Lingxi, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed greatly. He immediately stepped forth to ask what had happened.<br>However, Chu Xuanzhengfa did not respond. He continued to kowtow to Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng, begging them to treat Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Quickly bring your daughter here,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Chu Feng had already rushed out by the time Grandmaster Liangqiu said those words.<br>However, when he arrived outside the entrance gate, Chu Feng stood stunned.<br>Chu Hanpeng and the other experts from the Chu Heavenly Clan were all present.<br>Chu Lingxi was also present.<br>Merely, Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s condition was extremely bad.<br>Not only was she covered in blood and deathly pale, but her aura was also extremely weak. It was so weak that it was on the verge of disappearing.<br>However, what was most shocking of all were her eyes.<br>Originally, Chu Lingxi had a pair of extremely spirited eyes. They were like two galaxies, and could be said to be the most charming aspect to her.<br>However, her eyes were now completely bloodied.<br>The places that were originally bright and spirited were completely empty.<br>Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s eyes were gone.<br>Someone had forcibly dug out her eyes!!!<br>Although Chu Feng still didn&rsquo;t understand what had happened, he felt his brain going numb and his head going blank upon seeing such a thing.<br>He felt like there were millions and millions of swords skewering his heart. The pain was simply unbearable.<br>Seeing such a seriously injured Chu Lingxi. Chu Feng felt so much pain that he felt like he was on the verge of death.<br></p></div>
