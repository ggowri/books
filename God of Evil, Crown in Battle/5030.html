        <h1>Chapter 5029</h1>
        <div>: Interesting Inclinations<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The black-robed man left the scene after roaring at the crowd.<br>The crowd dared not to make a single squeak or move in the least. They feared that a single movement from them would provoke the black-robed man into taking their life.<br>Chu Feng was the only one who dared to stare straight at the black-robed man.<br>He didn&rsquo;t notice the black-robed man at the start, but upon careful examination, he noticed that the black robe made from stitching multiple black cloths together was actually a treasure. He couldn&rsquo;t tell what it was, but it was unlikely to be anything ordinary.<br>&ldquo;I wonder if he is Jiang Kongping.&rdquo;<br>That was the first deduction Chu Feng arrived at. Even if that wasn&rsquo;t the case, the black-robed man was likely to be a member of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. It was hard to imagine that a junior as strong as him was from the Eastern Region.<br>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyebrows suddenly shot up.<br>He had been continuously gathering information from Lush Immortal City while this commotion was ongoing, but he just caught hold of an interesting piece of news.<br>The women who had been recently captured were currently being sent to a single location under the escort of guards. Chu Feng thought that there was a good chance that the young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect was at that location.<br>Without any hesitation, he began making his way there.<br>The black-robed man had already walked quite a distance away by then, but as soon as Chu Feng took his leave, he suddenly halted his footsteps and turned around. The gaze fell upon where Chu Feng was previously standing.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng had already arrived at where the women were gathered. Just as he had expected, these women were all quite young, and they were all ravishing beauties. It was just that their faces were stained with tears, as if they could already see the tragic fate awaiting them.<br>&ldquo;What are you crying for? What&rsquo;s awaiting you is a life filled with riches! This is an opportunity of a lifetime!&rdquo;<br>The guards were still trying to coax the women, but their words were far too domineering, not to mention that the women didn&rsquo;t trust them at all.<br>Chu Feng took a look around and saw that there were around a hundred women in the room. There were likely to be even more victims than this.<br>The realization of that left Chu Feng greatly angered. For a moment, he even thought about killing the young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. A beast like that shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to live on the face of this world.<br>However, he chose to suppress his anger for the time being. He hadn&rsquo;t found out the whereabouts of the young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect yet. Until then, he couldn&rsquo;t afford to make a huge commotion.<br>Thus, he concealed his own presence and followed the group.<br>Soon, they were brought to a majestic palace. It was protected by a treasure, such that Chu Feng was unable to peer through the walls to see what was going on inside.<br>He snuck into the palace and saw that there were over a thousand women inside. Most of them had weak cultivation, but they were all outstanding beauties. They were most likely the ones who had been captured earlier.<br>What was intriguing was that none of these women were crying. On the contrary, they were chatting harmoniously amongst themselves.<br>That was definitely not what Chu Feng was expecting.<br>From their conversation, Chu Feng soon stumbled upon the truth.<br>It turned out that the women were captured here not to serve anyone. Rather, they had to practice a peculiar dance for an esteemed guest. This dance was not easy to master, such that they had to practice hard on it even with a mentor guiding them along.<br>The esteemed guest was rumored to be a young master, but no one seemed to know his true identity, including the dance mentors. They only knew that the young master was of high standing and possessed great powers.<br>On that aspect, it did seem likely that he was the young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.<br>&ldquo;Did I make a mistake here? Is the young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect just playful?&rdquo; Chu Feng wondered.<br>Just then, a group of twelve people entered the palace. Their entrance immediately caught everyone&rsquo;s attention.<br>Ten of them were dressed in guard uniforms whereas the remaining two were young men. It was these two young men whom everyone&rsquo;s attention was centered on.<br>They had fair skin and dashing appearances, reminiscent of a typical gigolo. Their appearance was so beautiful that one wouldn&rsquo;t harbor any doubt even if they claimed to be women.<br>The only reason Chu Feng and the others could tell that they were men was due to their tall height and unclothed bodies.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please let us go. I have two old parents at home to look after. I&rsquo;m begging you, please let us go!&rdquo;<br>The two men began pleading hard as soon as they were brought into the palace. Their cries sounded even more tragic than the women from before.<br>Some of the women appeared to know what the two men were going to be put through, such that they looked at them with eyes filled with pity.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry. It&rsquo;s your fortune to be able to serve that young master. As long as you can make it out alive, you&rsquo;ll be entitled to a lifetime of glory and wealth!&rdquo; the guards consoled them with a smile.<br>It was just that his smile looked sinister, and his words sounded off. It suggested that there was a chance that the two men might lose their lives.<br>That brought a frown to Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>These two men are going to serve the young master? What kind of eccentricity is this?<br>The slight bit of goodwill he felt toward the mysterious young master dissipated in an instant.<br>The two men were brought deeper into the palace, and Chu Feng followed them as well. They passed through a long corridor before finally arriving at a sleeping chamber.<br>At first glance, there appeared to be nothing special about the sleeping chamber, but it was in fact suffusing with spirit power. In fact, the interiors of the sleeping chamber appeared to be a formation space.<br>While Chu Feng already had some idea about what to expect, he was still shocked the moment the doors to the sleeping chamber were opened. There were thirteen men inside the sleeping chamber, all unclothed.<br>Of them, twelve were lying lifelessly on the ground amidst puddles of blood.<br>The remaining one was completely unharmed. In his hand was a thorned whip, which had blood trickling down its length.<br>Chu Feng could tell with a glance that the man was none other than the young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, Jiang Kongping.<br></p></div>
