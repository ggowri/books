        <div> - The Curse Is Real?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With all of that happening, Tantai Yanfeng became the target of public criticism. After all, he was the one who had brought the curse to the Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>Feeling helpless, Tantai Yanfeng ended up gathering all of his close relatives and people with blood relationships to him in the Tantai Heavenly Clan and left.<br>It was only after Tantai Yanfeng left that the people from the Tantai Heavenly Clan discovered that they had thought of things too simply.<br>Even after Tantai Yanfeng left with his close relatives, the terrifying screams continued to resound throughout the Tantai Heavenly Clan nightly.<br>Because of that, everyone realized that since the curse had arrived, their Tantai Heavenly Clan would not be able to cast it off even if Tantai Yanfeng had left their clan.<br>Furthermore, one day, Tantai Yanfeng, who had already left their Tantai Heavenly Clan for many days, also disappeared. It was not only him who disappeared; all of his close relatives that had left the Tantai Heavenly Clan with him also disappeared with him.<br>No one knew where Tantai Yanfeng and his relatives went. The only thing that could be found was a floor full of black feathers, and an intense reek of blood in Tantai Yanfeng&rsquo;s residence.<br>Everyone knew that Tantai Yanfeng&rsquo;s retribution had finally arrived. All of his relatives had disappeared from the world along with him.<br>However, even with that being the case, that terrifying shriek continued to resonate in the Tantai Heavenly Clan nightly.<br>The entire Tantai Heavenly Clan was enveloped in fear.<br>Everyone felt that the Tantai Heavenly Clan had been cursed, and would never be able to break free from the curse.<br>However, as they were unable to change the situation, and only one person would disappear every night the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen gradually grew accustomed to the terrifying situation.<br>Although the disappearance of a person would be very painful for their relatives, it remained that one would feel unconcerned about matters that did not affect them. Thus, as long as it was not their own relatives that disappeared, many Tantai Heavenly Clansmen were not affected by the curse.<br>With how enormous the Tantai Heavenly Clan was and how many clansmen they had, even though they were all of the same clan, many people viewed one another as strangers, and had never associated with each other.<br>Besides, the world of martial cultivators was a world filled with constant disputes. Compared to the number of deaths from wars and battles, the nightly disappearance of a single individual was actually not very significant at all.<br>Thus, later on, the Tantai Heavenly Clan ended up accepting the situation as it was. After becoming accustomed to the nighty disappearances, their days returned to normal again. In fact, there were even people that began to gamble with one another as to which clansman would disappear.<br>Although this sounded extremely abnormal, it was truly happening in the Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>Later on, the people of the Tantai Heavenly Clan even gave that female corpse a name -- the Black-feathered Specter.<br>On the third year since the appearance of the Black-feathered Specter, after the people of the Tantai Heavenly Clan had grown accustomed to the curse, that Black-feathered Specter suddenly disappeared, and never reappeared in the Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>Merely, no one would&rsquo;ve imagined that the Black-feathered Specter that had disappeared for over twenty thousand years would suddenly reappear.<br>The curse that had disappeared for over twenty thousand years had engulfed the Tantai Heavenly Clan again.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually the re-emergence of the curse? But, my big sister Liluo is not from the Tantai Heavenly Clan. Why would she be the one to disappear?&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to Tantai Xing&rsquo;er with a serious expression.<br>Chu Feng felt that even if that Black-feathered Specter had truly existed in the past, only the Tantai Heavenly Clan knew about it.<br>Only the Tantai Heavenly Clan knew whether or not that Black-feathered Specter was real or not.<br>Because of this, Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from doubting the authenticity of this matter. In fact, he even felt that it was likely the Tantai Heavenly Clan that had kidnapped Bai Liluo, and deliberately brought forth a matter that had occurred over twenty thousand years ago to fool him and avoid suspicion.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re suspecting my clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible for us to do this sort of thing. Please believe me,&rdquo; Tantai Xing&rsquo;er explained.<br>&ldquo;As this matter is related to this old man, I will not avoid responsibility. I will definitely reach the bottom of this matter,&rdquo; Wumig Xingyun said with a serious expression.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this matter is truly unrelated to my clan. We would never do that sort of thing,&rdquo; Tantai Xing&rsquo;er hurriedly explained. She knew that it was not only Chu Feng who was suspecting them; even Wuming Xingyun was suspecting them.<br>Because of that, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er became rather nervous. After all, even if she wanted to explain, it was impossible for her to do so.<br>Not to mention Chu Feng, even she would likely have such suspicions should she be the one who experienced something like that.<br>How could a curse that had disappeared for over twenty thousand years reappear all of a sudden? Furthermore&hellip; why would it land on an outsider of all people?<br>One must know that although someone would disappear nightly when the curse had enveloped the Tantai Heavenly Clan over twenty thousand years before. The people that had disappeared were all people from the Tantai Heavenly Clan. Never had an outsider been affected by the curse.<br>Thus, what had happened was truly odd.<br>&ldquo;Miss Tantai, this old man has never said that it was done by you all. I will investigate the truth of this matter,&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun said.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, the black feather Tantai Xing&rsquo;er held in her hand exploded.<br>In an instant, crimson gaseous flames wreaked havoc and the reek of blood instantly filled the entire room.<br>The reek of blood was many times more intense than when Tantai Xing&rsquo;er released it from the black feather.<br>However, at that moment, Chu Feng and the others had no heart to focus on the reek of blood. Instead, they all raised their heads upward.<br>The reason for that was because the crimson gaseous flames had gathered to form large words.<br>&lsquo;Obtain first place in the Ancestral Martial Decastars, and Bai Liluo shall be returned to you!!!&rsquo;<br></p></div>
