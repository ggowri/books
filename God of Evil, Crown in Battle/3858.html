        <div> - Nearly Provoked A Calamity<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? You&rsquo;re trying to come and go as you please?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a very ill-sounding tone.<br>&ldquo;What else do you want?&rdquo; asked the elders of the All-heaven Sect angrily.<br>However, right after they spoke, Tuoba Chengan waved his hand to indicate for them to shut up.<br>&ldquo;Young master Asura, do you still have instructions?&rdquo; asked Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;Before your arrival, those elders of your All-heaven Sect had unleashed killing intent toward me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for Lady Headmaster of the Red-dress Holy Land acting promptly, I&rsquo;m afraid that I would&rsquo;ve died here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And now, you all want to storm off in a huff with but a single word of apology? Who did you take me, Asura, to be? Am I someone that you all can kill at will?&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng said those words, he narrowed his brows and unleashed an air of chilliness.<br>The chilliness wreaked havoc throughout the surroundings, and pierced through one&rsquo;s flesh and bones.<br>Not to mention the people of the younger generation, even the elders from the All-heaven Sect and the Red-dress Holy Land were shaken by that chilliness.<br>It had nothing to do with one&rsquo;s cultivation or oppressive might.<br>The grandeur of that chilliness was simply akin to the descent of a ruler, and a god becoming angry.<br>It was as if the experts from the All-heaven Sect were nothing more than ants in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>When ants dared to provoke a god, how could the god not possibly be furious?<br>Although it was very hard to believe, even the elders from the All-heaven Sect were panicking slightly.<br>&ldquo;Young master Asura, they did not know the whole situation, and had a momentary misunderstanding. I believe that they do not possess any malice towards young master Asura. This old man will apologize to them on your behalf here.&rdquo; As Tuoba Chengan spoke, he actually really bowed to Chu Feng to express his apology,<br>&ldquo;Why would you need to apologize for them when they&rsquo;re here?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Tuoba Chengan looked to the elders of the All-heaven Sect and shouted angrily. &ldquo;Why are you all still standing there?! Quickly apologize to young master Asura!&rdquo;<br>Helpless, those elders also began to apologize to Chu Feng.<br>If they hadn&rsquo;t witnessed it themselves, the elders of the Red-dress Holy Land would simply not believe what they were witnessing.<br>This person of the younger generation by the name of Asura beat up the most valued genius of the All-heaven Sect. Yet, not only was he not harmed in the slightest, he had even demanded that the All-heaven Sect elders apologize to him.<br>Most incredible of all, those All-heaven Sect elders actually really ended up apologizing to him.<br>Even Tuoba Chengan, who was renowned for his ferociousness, was extremely respectful to that Asura, fearing to disobey him.<br>At that moment, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders were simply unable to help themselves from pondering a question again -- perhaps this Asura truly possessed an enormous origin.<br>They were thinking that not only because of the attitude Tuoba Chengan displayed towards Chu Feng.<br>It was also because of how Chu Feng was able to keep his calm before a threat to his life, and remain arrogant the entire time.<br>He was simply acting like a crown prince that had decided to mingle with the common folk incognito.<br>With many experts protecting him, how could he possibly be afraid of a local tyrant?<br>Upon their return, Tuoba Chengan gathered all the elders and important disciples.<br>He needed to give everyone an explanation for what had happened.<br>They had also sealed off the palace hall, as if they were planning to discuss some important and confidential matter.<br>&ldquo;Yifan, what is wrong with you today? Why would you do such a thing?&rdquo; Tuoba Chengan asked sternly.<br>The reason why he asked that was because he knew Nangong Yifan was someone who had a lot of self-control, and would simply not do something so detrimental to his image.<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, it&rsquo;s not that I lacked self-control, it&rsquo;s just that that bitch Yin Zhuanghong is simply one who refuses the face given to her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve attended to her in every possible way and shown extreme affection for her. Even though she has always treated me coldly, I&rsquo;ve remained passionate about her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When have I, Nangong Yifan, ever treated a person in such a manner?&rdquo;<br>Nangong Yifan actually had a look of grievance on his face as he said those words.<br>&ldquo;Enough, I know of your hardships.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, restrain yourself for a while longer. At least, now is not the time to have a falling-out.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wait for Lord Sectmaster to exit his closed-door training. At that time, we will take care of the Red-dress Holy Land. At that time, you can play with that girl however you wish. She will become your slave." said Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, Lord Sectmaster has decided to eliminate the Red-dress Holy Land?&rdquo; An elder asked.<br>&ldquo;The Red-dress Holy Land is too stubborn, and continues to insist that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond is their sole possession.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond contains precious treasures left behind by the experts of the Ancient Era. Those treasures should naturally belong to our All-heaven Sect. The fact that they&rsquo;re trying to selfishly keep those treasures for themselves is a sign of their disloyalty.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If the treasures in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond are acquired by them, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s strength will increase by leaps and bounds. At that time, they will definitely become a formidable opponent to our All-heaven Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster wouldn&rsquo;t possibly allow such a thing to occur." said Tuoba Chengan.<br>Hearing those words, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s elders all realized what would happen to the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Thus, the burning anger in their hearts decreased enormously.<br>Since they knew that they would eliminate the people of the Red-dress Holy Land sooner or later, they naturally did not have to hurry to take care of them now.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s thorny right now is that irksome fellow who appeared out of nowhere.&rdquo; Tuoba Chengan frowned as he said those words.<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, are you talking about that Asura?&rdquo; asked an elder.<br>&ldquo;That child possesses superb talent and an unidentified origin. We cannot disregard him." said Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, could he be bluffing?&rdquo; asked an elder.<br>&ldquo;I actually arrived when Yifan was beaten up earlier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I arrived before you all were even alarmed by that boy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why I didn&rsquo;t show myself was because I wanted to observe that boy&rsquo;s reaction.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the outcome of my observation was extremely bad.&rdquo;<br>Tuoba Chengan&rsquo;s frown grew even worse as he said those words.<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, what do you mean by that? Did you discover something?&rdquo; the elders asked in unison.<br>&ldquo;That boy remained calm and continued to emit an imposing air even when confronted with death. Even though our All-heaven Sect is renowned for our strength and prowess, he did not place us in his eyes at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;His imposing behavior does not resemble a disguise.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, he is most likely backed by someone or some power. And, regardless of who that person or power might be, they are definitely not something that our All-heaven Sect can afford to provoke.&rdquo;<br>Once Tuoba Chengan said those words, those elders also narrowed their brows.<br>They were not only panicking, but they even had looks of lingering fear on their faces.<br>They had suddenly discovered after hearing Tuoba Chengan&rsquo;s words that they had nearly provoked a calamity.<br></p></div>
