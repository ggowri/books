        <div> - The True Identity Exposed<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was floating in midair.<br>He was pointing at the black cauldron with one hand and holding a paper talisman with the other. He was also chanting something that Chu Feng and the others were unable to understand.<br>Although what the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was doing did not appear imposing at all, Chu Feng and the others were fully concentrated on his actions.<br>They all knew that everything the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was doing was most definitely not as simple as it appeared to be.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted raised his arm, and the paper talisman in his hand flew toward the black cauldron.<br>&ldquo;Seal!!!&rdquo;<br>With a shout, the paper talisman started to shine brightly, and then landed on the opening of the black cauldron.<br>When the light dissipated, the crowd discovered that the paper talisman had disappeared. However, the complicated runes and symbols on the paper talisman were imprinted onto the black cauldron.<br>Chu Feng was able to see that the power of the Void Sacred Tree within the black cauldron looked like water. However, it was very berserk. It was like there were countless ferocious beasts struggling to break free from a cage.<br>They tried repeatedly to rush out from the cauldron. Unfortunately, whenever they approached the opening of the cauldron, countless runes would start to shine with light, forming a barrier that forced them back in.<br>Sure enough, it was as Chu Feng and the others had expected. The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s seemingly simple technique was actually very powerful. Otherwise&hellip; how could it possibly contain such a berserk black cauldron, and the power of the Void Sacred Tree within the black cauldron?<br>&ldquo;This power is simply too berserk. It still needs to be refined.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, we&rsquo;ve succeeded.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It's thanks to you young friends that we were able to successfully infuse that power into the black cauldron. Thank you,&rdquo; the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted clasped his fist at Chu Feng and the Zhang siblings.<br>&ldquo;Lord Demon Exalted, that is merely these subordinates&rsquo; duty,&rdquo; the three Zhang siblings would naturally not dare to accept thanks from the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. Immediately, the three of them half knelt and returned the courteous bow to the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Lord Demon Exalted, our clan has been framed and ruined by villainous scoundrels in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Milord, please uphold justice for us,&rdquo; Zhang Yanfeng took the opportunity to express their purpose.<br>&ldquo;The three of you are soon to become this old man&rsquo;s successors. I will impart the completed Blood-devouring Demon Technique to you three.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for your clansmen, they are allowed to train here. This place was specially created as a training ground for the Blood-devouring Demon Technique.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should you and your clansmen train here, your cultivations will all increase greatly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the grudges and grievances you all have outside will have to be settled by yourselves. This old man will not get involved with them,&rdquo; the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Demon Exalted.&rdquo;<br>The three Zhang siblings were overjoyed. Even though the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted told them to settle their grudges and grievances themselves, being able to learn the completed Blood-devouring Demon Technique was enough to make them extremely excited.<br>Furthermore, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was going to allow them to stay there to train.<br>At that moment, the three Zhang siblings felt that their future cultivation speed would increase by leaps and bounds. Thus, how could they not rejoice? How could they not be excited?<br>Suddenly, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted said to Wang Qiang, &ldquo;Little stutterer, there&rsquo;s something that I have to discuss with young friend Chu Feng in private. You can bring the three of them out first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah? O-ol-old fart, w-what are you pl-planning to do?&rdquo; A cautious look appeared in Wang Qiang&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;It has nothing to do with you. Go out now,&rdquo; as the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted spoke, he extended his hand and made a grabbing motion. The title plate Wang Qiang held in his hand was sucked into the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s hand.<br>Following that, a black spirit formation gate appeared.<br>Suction power emerged from the black formation gate, and Wang Qiang and the three Zhang siblings were all sucked into it.<br>At that moment, only Chu Feng and the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted remained.<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was completely covered in bandages. His appearance was truly quite terrifying. On top of that, there was his enormous power and his unpleasant-sounding name. Being alone with such an existence, even Chu Feng felt uneasy.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what might you need from me?&rdquo; he asked.<br>&ldquo;This old man wishes to know what happened after you entered that black gate,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>Chu Feng appeared calm upon hearing those words, but his heart was in a complete uproar.<br>He felt that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted would not ask about that without cause. He must have a purpose in mind.<br>&ldquo;Senior, the dark black gate was a test. There were some spirit formations inside. Apart from the spirit formations, there was nothing else,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, it turns out you also know how to lie.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man had thought that someone as loyal and upright as yourself would not tell lies,&rdquo; the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted let out a meaningful laugh.<br>After saying those words, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted bent his back and bowed to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what are you doing?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, this old man thanks you for helping me,&rdquo; after saying those words, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted stood back up. He continued, &ldquo;However&hellip; this old man did not wait in the Void Sacred Tree all these years for the sake of stealing its power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What this old man truly needs should be in young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re a benefactor to this old man. I am truly apologetic, but I need what you have in your body.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted finished saying those words, Chu Feng flipped his wrist, and a crimson sword appeared in his hand.<br>Once the Evil God Sword appeared, crimson gaseous flames immediately covered it.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Accompanying the appearance of the Evil God Sword was a sky full of crimson clouds, great power and a terrifying aura.<br>The aura of the Evil God Sword resembled something from the netherworld. Feeling it, one would become terrified.<br>At that moment, the aura emitted by the Evil God Sword appeared very imposing.<br>Chu Feng had unleashed the power of the Evil God Sword from the very start.<br>After all, he was confronted with the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, a monster that had lived since the Ancient Era. He did not dare to be careless in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;That sword's truly quite something. That little stutterer Wang Qiang didn't lie to this old man.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, being able to possess such a demon sword, you're no average individual either.&rdquo;<br>Even though the words spoken by the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted sounded like praises for the Evil God Sword, he did not show the slightest trace of fear. Instead, there was some contempt.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this junior has no intention to offend you. Merely, what senior said caused this junior unease. That is why I took out this sword to defend myself,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t overthinking things. Indeed, I plan to do something harmful to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should know how powerful that thing is. However, you are simply incapable of controlling it. You are also unqualified to obtain it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rather than wasting it on yourself, it's better you hand it over to this old man,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;In that case, it means that senior knows of her origin?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>As matters stood, Chu Feng realized that he was unable to deceive the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>To be exact, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted knew everything from the very start.<br>Rather than trying to continue lying, it was better to get to the bottom of things, and see if he could gain some information about that little girl from the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br></p></div>
