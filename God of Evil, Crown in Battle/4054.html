        <h1>Chapter 4053</h1>
        <div> - Clan Wiped Out<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, the blue-gowned man asked, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Have you investigated the location where that man was undergoing training? Are there treasures capable of increasing one&rsquo;s cultivation there?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, Chu Xuanyuan wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed himself to be deliberately punished so that he could enter closed-door training there, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve investigated that place. It only possesses power capable of restraining people with Heavenly Bloodlines. Normally, Heavenly Bloodline possessors will find their cultivations falling by staying there. It&rsquo;s impossible for their cultivations to increase.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have no idea why Chu Xuanyuan insisted on going there,&rdquo; said Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;Useless. Trash like you would naturally not be able to investigate anything. After I wipe out that Chu Heavenly Clan, I will personally go there and investigate it,&rdquo; said the blue-gowned man.<br>&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re planning to kill Chu Feng?&rdquo; asked Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;A small clan managed to produce three generations of outstanding geniuses in succession. Furthermore, they&rsquo;re a grandfather to grandson. That is not good at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I do not fear them, it remains that we will not frequently come here. During the times when I&rsquo;m not here, you will definitely not be able to handle them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re unable to take care of them, I&rsquo;ll have to help you get rid of them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Useless thing, if only you were able to live up to our standards, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to come and wipe your ass for you.&rdquo;<br>The blue-gowned man glared at Wuming Doutian with a mocking gaze.<br>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Wuming Doutian wanted to say something.<br>&ldquo;But what? You couldn&rsquo;t possibly be thinking that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to take care of a person of the younger generation?&rdquo;<br>The blue-gowned man's face became gloomy. He was slightly displeased.<br>&ldquo;This lowly one wouldn&rsquo;t dare doubt milord&rsquo;s strength.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip; that Chu Feng was able to kill me today. Yet, he spared me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If&hellip;&rdquo;<br>It turned out that Wuming Doutian was thinking that it would be unsuitable for them to go wipe out the Chu Heavenly Clan after he had been spared by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a palm ruthlessly landed on Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s cheek.<br>It was the blue-gowned man. His slap sent Wuming Doutian flying.<br>When Wuming Doutian finally landed, his cheek had changed shape.<br>Already in a weakened state, his health grew even worse.<br>However, he did not dare to utter a word. Instead, he hurriedly crawled up and half-knelt again.<br>One could tell from his actions how deeply afraid he was of the man before him.<br>&ldquo;Useless trash, who do you think you are? You&rsquo;re nothing more than our dog!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re actually talking about righteousness and benevolence now?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let me tell you this, if your Wuming Clan is unable to control the Ancestral Martial Starfield, we will simply replace you!"<br>&ldquo;At that time, your Wuming Clan will also disappear from this world. Not a single one of you shall think about living!&rdquo; The blue-gowned man shouted angrily. His voice resonated throughout the entire war chariot.<br>The Wuming Clansmen were so terrified by his words that they'd nearly collapsed.<br>After all, that man clearly had the power to wipe out their Wuming Clan.<br>Fortunately, the man did not attack them. After threatening them, he soared into the sky and flew off.<br>Right after that blue-gowned man flew away, two more figures flew out and towards the direction he'd left in.<br>They were Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>The two of them had only managed to fly out the palace entrance before letting out screams.<br>It turned out that the outside of the palace entrance had been sealed by an invisible power.<br>&ldquo;What are the two of you trying to do?!&rdquo; Wuming Doutian shouted angrily.<br>The power that had stopped Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo was Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s.<br>&ldquo;Lord Father, we are friends with Chu Feng, we cannot let him die like this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right, we must go rescue Chu Feng.&rdquo; Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo replied simultaneously.<br>&ldquo;Preposterous! You&rsquo;re trying to rescue him? You two think that you can rescue him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;By the time you two arrive, the Chu Heavenly Clan would have already been wiped out.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he sees the two of you, you will also be killed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not to mention the two of you, not even Long Daozhi would necessarily dare try to save Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you know who that man is?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He is&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Cough, cough~~&rdquo;<br>Perhaps because he was overly infuriated and extremely weak, before Wuming Doutian could finish his words, he started coughing violently.<br>&ldquo;Yuanzhi, Xiongmo, do not make a scene.&rdquo;<br>Seeing Wuming Doutian's condition, the Wuming Clansmen immediately rushed over to stop Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo. No matter how the two of them struggled, they were not allowed to leave.<br>At the same time, some other Wuming Clansmen went over to Wuming Doutian with the intention of treating his injuries.<br>&ldquo;No need,&rdquo; Wuming Doutian waved his hand. Then, he turned his gaze outside the palace entrance.<br>Through the destroyed palace entrance, he looked in the direction of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>His gaze was rather complicated.<br>&ldquo;This is the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s calamity. Whether or not they will be able to survive this calamity will be up to their fate,&rdquo; Wuming Doutian said in a low voice.<br>&ldquo;Lord Realm Master, this subordinate has a question that I do not know if I can ask,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo walked over to Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;As matters stand, what couldn&rsquo;t you ask? Go ahead and ask what you want to ask,&rdquo; said Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;Our clan has occupied the Starfield Master Realm for so many years. All this time, our clansmen have been using our special bloodline power to excavate the blue ore from the mine located in the depths of the Starfield Master Realm. Yet, we have never used that blue ore.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the past, I&rsquo;ve asked milord about it, but milord wasn&rsquo;t willing to tell me the reason why.&rdquo;<br>Before Wuming Fenghuo had even finished his question, Wuming Doutian interrupted him, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, the blue ores are supplied to them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is the mission our Wuming Clan was tasked with, the reason why we came here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why we rule over the Ancestral Martial Starfield is so that we can control the Starfield Master Realm and excavate the blue ores for them to train with.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Due to the special characteristics of the blue ores, only our Wuming Clan can use our special bloodline power to excavate them. That is why they need us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, our Wuming Clan originally had a surname that was erased by them.&rdquo; [1. Wuming means nameless.]<br>&ldquo;They said that since we&rsquo;re dogs, we shouldn&rsquo;t have surnames.&rdquo;<br>As Wuming Doutian said those words, he had a wry smile on his face.<br>The aloof and above Wuming Doutian had relinquished all of his pride and arrogance to tell the truth.<br>When the Wuming Clansmen learned the truth, they all felt very unwell.<br>It turned out that they who had ruled over the Ancestral Martial Starfield for so many years were nothing more than someone else&rsquo;s dogs.<br>&ldquo;Lord Realm Master, do you know the cultivation of that man?&rdquo; asked Wuming Fenghuo.<br>&ldquo;During our last meeting, he was a rank four Utmost Exalted. He should be a rank five Utmost Exalted now, or perhaps even stronger,&rdquo; said Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;Then, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that the Chu Heavenly Clan&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Wuming Fenghuo revealed a difficult expression. He had asked about the cultivation of the man because he'd thought that if his cultivation was not particularly strong, the Chu Heavenly Clan might still be able to survive with how talented Chu Feng was.<br>However, if the man&rsquo;s cultivation was that of a rank five Utmost Exalted, things would be hopeless for them.<br>&ldquo;Whilst his cultivation is not particularly powerful, the power behind him is extremely powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you know why the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, being clearly stronger than our Wuming Clan, does not dare to assume the position of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s overlord?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because our Wuming Clan is backed by them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as they exist, no one will dare to assume the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s overlord status. Regardless of who they might be, therefore, as long as they assume the overlord position, they will be killed,&rdquo; said Wuming Doutian.<br>Hearing those words, the crowd present suddenly recalled the words Wuming Doutian had said to Chu Feng when he'd been fighting him.<br>It turned out that their Lord Realm Master had not been trying to scare Chu Feng.<br>Instead, there really was a powerful existence secretly controlling the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Learning this, the Wuming Clansmen felt even more complicated.<br>The palace hall had become strangely quiet.<br>The conceited Wuming Clansmen had learned that they were nothing more than someone else&rsquo;s dogs. This information was extremely stifling and painful, so much so that they did not know what to do.<br>The silence was only broken by the sudden appearance of a man.<br>When they saw the man, everyone felt their hearts tensing up.<br>The man wore the same blue gown as the man who'd been there earlier.<br>Furthermore, he had the same sort of special long blue hair.<br>Most importantly, the man&rsquo;s aura was actually even stronger than that of the man before.<br>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Lanfu Jianpeng?!&rdquo; the man looked at Wuming Doutian and asked loudly the moment he appeared.<br>&ldquo;I pay my respects to Lord Longping.&rdquo;<br>Wuming Doutian immediately half-knelt and lowered his head respectfully.<br>Seeing that, the other Wuming Clansmen also half-knelt before him.<br>That man was the Lord Longping Wuming Doutian had mentioned earlier, the other person who had witnessed his battle with Chu Xuanyuan.<br>&ldquo;Wuming Doutian, I&rsquo;m asking you where Lanfu Jianpeng went!&rdquo; Lord Longping shouted angrily.<br>&ldquo;Lord Jianpeng left to the Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; replied Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s already left?&rdquo;<br>Lord Longping revealed a look of panic when he heard those words. He hurriedly asked, &ldquo;How long ago did he set off?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been nearly an hour now,&rdquo; said Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>Lord Longping immediately turned around and intended to leave.<br>However, he suddenly stopped after turning around. Then, he extended his arm and made a grabbing motion. Wuming Doutian was sucked over to his side.<br>Bringing Wuming Doutian along, he rapidly flew in the direction of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>En route, Wuming Doutian was unable to keep himself from asking, &ldquo;Long Longping, what has happened?&rdquo;<br>He knew that Lord Longping was different from Lord Jianpeng.<br>Not only was Lord Longping stronger, he also possessed a calmer temperament.<br>With how nervous Lord Longping was, it meant that something major had happened.<br>&ldquo;If Lanfu Jianpeng is to massacre the Chu Heavenly Clan today, not only will your Wuming Clan be wiped out, but even my Blue Talisman Clan will be wiped out,&rdquo; said Lord Longping.<br>[1. Blue Talisman Clan &rarr; Lanfu Clan]<br></p></div>
