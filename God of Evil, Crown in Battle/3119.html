        <h1>Chapter 3118</h1>
        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Cultivation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whilst there were a lot of palaces in the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s headquarters, there were very few people living there.<br>At the very least, the people there at present numbered only over a hundred.<br>Even though it was possible that some people had left to train, Chu Feng felt that even if everyone gathered there, their number would still not be a lot.<br>After all, the ability to enter the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm only presented itself once every three years. Furthermore, only a few people from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm could go there every three years.<br>Moreover, there would inevitably be people leaving too. As such, it was actually not strange for there to be few people present. It would instead be strange if there were a lot of people gathered there.<br>After inspecting the area, the cultivations of the people present were all revealed to Chu Feng.<br>The great majority of the people present were True Immortals. However, many among them were peak True Immortals.<br>That said, their ages were older than Chu Feng and the others. The great majority of them were over two hundred years old. In other words, they were people that had trained for over a hundred years longer than Chu Feng and the others.<br>Thus, peak True Immortal was actually not a strong level of cultivation for people their age. Furthermore, the ones that were given the opportunity to be there should all have a certain amount of talent, and be deemed as geniuses.<br>Fortunately, not everyone were True Immortals.<br>There were thirty-two people there that were Heavenly Immortals.<br>However, the majority of them were only rank one Heavenly Immortals. Even the strongest amongst them was only a rank three Heavenly Immortal.<br>With that strength, it was no wonder their status and prowess were very low in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>&ldquo;Who is it?!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded from ahead. Following that, many figures soared into the sky and surrounded Chu Feng and the others.<br>The people from the Chu Heavenly Clan finally discovered Chu Feng and the others. Merely, Chu Feng was still disappointed by how slow their reactions were.<br>When those people first appeared, they all had stern expressions. However, soon, someone among them recognized Chu Shuangshuang, and immediately revealed a joyous expression.<br>&ldquo;Little sister Shuangshuang, it&rsquo;s you?&rdquo;<br>The man that approached them first was about the same age as Chu Shuangshaung. However, he had a very old-looking face, and resembled a middle-aged man. Standing together with Chu Shuangshuang, the two of them looked very unsuited for one another.<br>That said, the two of them were looking at one another with very close and dear looks in their eyes. Evidently, they had known one another for a long time.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Ping, it&rsquo;s been a long time. I trust you have been well since we last met,&rdquo; Chu Shuangshuang smiled.<br>&ldquo;Shaugshaung, it really is you. After all these years, you&rsquo;ve finally entered the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I truly never imagined that you&rsquo;d be capable of reaching rank nine True immortal outside the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. Little sister Shaungshuang, you are truly amazing,&rdquo; the man called Chu Ping spoke with a joyous expression on his face as he looked to Chu Shuangshuang.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Ping, you&rsquo;re the amazing one. I&rsquo;ve heard that you&rsquo;re already a rank one Heavenly Immortal,&rdquo; Chu Shuangshaung smiled.<br>The reason why she said that was because Chu Ping was concealing his cultivation. With her strength, it was impossible for her to determine Chu Ping&rsquo;s actual cultivation.<br>The reason why she was so certain when she said Chu Ping was a rank one Heavenly Immortal was because that was what she had heard from the people that had returned from the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>&ldquo;Haha, I&rsquo;ve been here for so long, if I couldn&rsquo;t even reach rank one Heavenly Immortal, wouldn&rsquo;t I have wasted our clan&rsquo;s Cultivation Key?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little sister Shuangshuang, with your talent, I dare to guarantee that you will definitely be able to reach a breakthrough to Heavenly Immortal here. Even surpassing me is not an impossibility,&rdquo; Chu Ping said.<br>Faced with Chu Ping&rsquo;s praise, Chu Shuangshuang only smiled. Then, she began to introduce Chu Ping and the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen present to Chu Feng and the others.<br>Through Chu Shuangshuang&rsquo;s introduction, Chu Feng and the others came to find out that Chu Ping and the others had been there for some time now.<br>After introducing Chu Ping and the others, Chu Shuangshuang began to introduce Chu Feng and the others that had come with her.<br>However, before Chu Shuangshuang could begin her introduction, Chu Ping waved his hand with a smile on his face. He said, &ldquo;Little sister Shuangshuang, there&rsquo;s no need for you to introduce them. I know all these little brothers here.&rdquo;<br>Afterward, Chu Ping said to Chu Qing and the others in succession, &ldquo;You must be little brother Chu Qing, our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s strongest person of the younger generation right now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You must be little brother Chu Haoyan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You must be little brother Chu Huanyu. All of you are talents rarely seen in our Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little brothers, your cultivations are so strong at such a young age. Your reputations are truly well-deserved.&rdquo;<br>Even though Chu Ping had been training in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm for a very long time, even though the talents of Chu Qing and the others were not revealed when they entered the Chu Heavenly Clans&rsquo; territory, even though he did not know of Chu Qing and the others, it remained that people from the Chu Heavenly Clan would enter the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm every three years.<br>As such, whenever new Chu Heavenly Clansmen arrived in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, the people in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm would always ask them about the situation in the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Thus, whilst those people seemed to be completely cut off from the rest of the world training in there, they actually knew about things outside, and naturally also knew about Chu Qing and the others.<br>However, when Chu Ping looked to Chu Feng, he revealed a slightly embarrassed look.<br>He was carefully sorting through his memories of the portraits of their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s outstanding younger generations. However, no matter what, he was unable to recall Chu Feng.<br>After trying to figure out who Chu Feng was, Chu Ping laughed awkwardly. Then, he said, &ldquo;I am truly sorry. I&rsquo;m getting too old. My memory is getting bad. Little brother, I am unable to recall who you might be.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This little brother here is even more amazing. He is senior Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Shuangshuang introduced him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Upon finding out about Chu Feng&rsquo;s identity, all the people present, including that Chu Ping, revealed astonished looks.<br>Since they knew about even Chu Qing and the others, they naturally also knew about the matter of Chu Feng and Chu Xuanyuan being driven out of their Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>However, the information that they knew was information from three years ago.<br>According to that information, Chu Feng should be dead. As such, how could Chu Feng be alive, and here?<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Ping, little brother Chu Feng has received Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s acknowledgement and returned to our Chu Heavenly Clan. Like us, he is also a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Shuangshuang explained.<br>The people present were no fools. They immediately realized what was going on.<br>To put it simply, they already knew that Chu Feng had not only not died, but he should also be capable of cultivating. Because he was capable of cultivating, he had returned to their Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;In that case, it would mean that little brother Chu Feng is capable of cultivating?&rdquo; After saying those words, Chu Ping looked to Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, is it possible for you to put away the treasure that is concealing your cultivation so that we are able to know what level of cultivation you currently possess?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we know your cultivation, it will be easier for us to instruct you as to where to train.&rdquo;<br>The reason he asked that was because Chu Feng was concealing his cultivation. Chu Qing had no idea what Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was.<br>In fact, it was not only Chu Feng who was concealing his cultivation. Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu were all concealing their cultivations.<br>The reason for that was because concealing one&rsquo;s cultivation was not only a defensive method, but it was also a good custom. It was a sign of respect to others.<br>However, as Chu Ping was a rank one Heavenly Immortal, even though Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu had concealed their cultivation, they would still not be able to hide their cultivations from him.<br>Chu Feng, on the other hand, was able to successfully conceal his cultivation from Chu Ping and the others. Chu Ping and the others did not suspect that Chu Feng was able to successfully conceal his cultivation because it was above theirs.<br>After all, the Chu Feng that they&rsquo;d heard of was trash incapable of cultivating.<br>Even if Chu Feng was capable of training, Chu Ping and the others still did not feel that Chu Feng would be stronger than them.<br>In fact, they felt that Chu Feng was not only inferior to them, but he was definitely inferior to Chu Qing, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu, those three renowned geniuses.<br>That was the reason why Chu Ping was so determined that Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was being concealed from them through some sort of treasure.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Ping, little brother Chu Feng is truly amazing right now. His current cultivation&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing this, Chu Shuangshuang immediately started speaking. She wanted to reveal what Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was.<br>However, before Chu Shuangshuang could finish, a voice filled with mockery sounded from deep within the base.<br>&ldquo;Some trash exiled from our clan because he was unable to cultivate actually immediately forgot his status as exiled trash upon his return, and decided to be unnecessarily mystifying by concealing his cultivation before us with a treasure?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that this son of Chu Xuanyuan has not learned our clan&rsquo;s rule of respecting one&rsquo;s seniors.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng started to frown. A displeased expression appeared in his eyes.<br>It would be one thing if that person were to speak ill of him. However, that person actually involved his father.<br>This was not only an insult to him, but it was also an insult to his father.<br>Thus, Chu Feng felt extremely displeased.<br></p></div>
