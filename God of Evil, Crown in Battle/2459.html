        <div> - Martial Comprehension Ground<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>The pressure had reached a state that Chu Feng found unbearable now.<br>However, even with this being the case, Chu Feng continued to challengingly take another step forward.<br>&ldquo;Swoosh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before Chu Feng&rsquo;s feet could stabilize, he suddenly slipped. Chu Feng rolled down the flight of steps.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Benefactor!!!&rdquo;<br>Witnessing that scene, Zhan Lingtong and Zhan Lingling were immediately alarmed. They were deeply worried.<br>However, the two of them were simply unable to ascend that flight of steps. Thus, they could only watch impatiently and worry for Chu Feng helplessly.<br>&ldquo;Paaa~~~&rdquo;<br>When Chu Feng fell down the flights of steps until he reached the halfway mark, the pressure he felt had decreased so much that he actually managed to grab onto the steps to stabilize himself.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had managed to stabilize himself, Zhan Lingling and Zhan Lingtong heaved sighs of relief.<br>However, the expressions on their faces only managed to ease for a moment before they became nervous again.<br>Chu Feng had not walked down the steps. Rather, he wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and began to proceed upwards again.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, do not force yourself. That pressure is no small matter; it might even end up killing you,&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng refused to give up, Zhan Lingtong started to urge him to not continue.<br>However, Chu Feng did not pay attention to Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s warning, and continued onward. Soon, he returned to the spot where he had been previously.<br>This time around, Chu Feng was prepared. He did not urgently step forward. Rather, he took a long while to stabilize his breathing and allow himself to get used to the pressure there.<br>When he felt that he could continue onward, he took another step forward.<br>Chu Feng managed to successfully walk up. However, the pressure once again caused him to bleed from his seven facial orifices, once again causing his body to tremble.<br>Chu Feng had returned to the same state he was in when he fell before.<br>However, the location where Chu Feng currently stood was still a certain distance from the end of the flight of steps.<br>It was already extremely difficult for Chu Feng to resist the pressure there. Yet, the pressure upward would be more and more powerful. Thus, the two siblings felt that Chu Feng would not be able to successfully scale the steps and reach the top.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, I beg of you, please stop forcing yourself. You do not know how frightening those flight of steps are. It really has caused many people to die before. The injuries that my father sustained from it could already be considered light.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was risking his life, Zhan Lingtong grew so worried that tears began to flow out from his eyes.<br>The way he saw it, Chu Feng was someone that possessed superb talent, someone that would achieve greatness in the future even without reaching the third level. As such, there was simply no need for Chu Feng to take such a risk with his life.<br>&ldquo;Lingtong, let me ask you, what sort of situation was it like for senior Zhan Haichuan when he ascended the steps?&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly asked in a weak voice.<br>&ldquo;Lord Zhan Haichuan? I believe it was very effortless for him to reach the third level,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br>&ldquo;Then, since the time when your ancestor created the Martial Comprehension Ground, has there been anyone else other than senior Zhan Haichuan who managed to reach the third level?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked again.<br>&ldquo;No, there hasn&rsquo;t. Lord Zhan Haichuan is the only person. Apart from him, there has never been anyone that managed to ascend to the third level. In fact, there has never been anyone who managed to reach where you&rsquo;re standing right now, big brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, big brother Chu Feng, you are already extremely amazing. You are the second most amazing person apart from Lord Zhan Haichuan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are already extremely amazing to be able to accomplish all this. There is simply no need for you to force yourself like this,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br>&ldquo;What Lingtong says is correct. Benefactor, you have already proved yourself. There is no need for you to force yourself to continue onward. There is no need for you to take this risk anymore,&rdquo; Zhan Lingling echoed.<br>The way she saw it, if Chu Feng were to continue onward, he would definitely be seriously injured even if he wasn&rsquo;t killed by the pressure. As for that, it was not something that they wished to see.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that you all have most likely been deceived,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled and shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Deceived?&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong and Zhan Lingling&rsquo;s expression turned sluggish. They revealed puzzled looks.<br>&ldquo;If only senior Zhan Haichuan had managed to reach where I&rsquo;m standing, he&hellip; would definitely not have been able to easily ascend to the third level,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, what do you mean by that?&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong and Zhan Lingling asked in unison.<br>&ldquo;There are bloodstains here. Although they have already dried up through the passage of time, I am still able to see the bloodstains. The bloodstains continue all the way up until the third level,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, Lord Zhan Haichuan was also overwhelmed by the enormous pressure and seriously injured?!&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong and Zhan Lingling were startled.<br>After all, the Zhan Haichuan that they&rsquo;d heard about all their lives was the picture of utter perfection.<br>Zhan Haichuan had never been defeated in his entire life. Even for the flight of steps leading to the Martial Comprehension Ground&rsquo;s third level that no one was able to scale, he managed to easily ascend it.<br>However now, after hearing what Chu Feng said, it would appear that Zhan Haichuan&rsquo;s achievements were not true. At the very least&hellip; he had not managed to ascend the flight of steps to the third level with ease.<br>&ldquo;Lingtong, it is impossible for me to determine that the bloodstains here are most definitely senior Zhan Haichuan&rsquo;s. However, I am going to tell you one thing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the path of martial cultivation, one must go against the current. If you are to cower and stop, it will be very difficult to become strong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, this flight of steps is already no longer a mere flight of steps. It is also a path, a path to becoming stronger.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps it is not the only path to becoming stronger. However, I do not wish to waste time finding another path.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus&hellip; no matter what, I must surmount it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is the courage that a martial cultivator should possess.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he took another step forward.<br>Upon reaching a step higher, the pressure grew much stronger again.<br>However, this time around, the trembling on Chu Feng&rsquo;s body did not grow stronger. He had actually managed to withstand it.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you!!!&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong was stunned by Chu Feng&rsquo;s behavior.<br>He was already stupefied by Chu Feng. It was not the words that Chu Feng said to him. Rather, he was stupefied by Chu Feng&rsquo;s willpower.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s willpower was so unyielding and stubborn. To martial cultivators, this sort of willpower was extremely precious. Yet, it was also a sort of willpower that the great majority of people did not possess.<br>With each step forward, Chu Feng would take a short breather to adapt to the pressure.<br>Then, Chu Feng actually managed to, one step at a time, ascend to the top and reach the third level.<br>&ldquo;Success! Big brother Chu Feng actually succeeded!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Big sister, did you see that?! Big brother Chu Feng managed to successfully ascend to the Martial Comprehension Ground&rsquo;s third level!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens! That is the third level that only Lord Zhan Haichuan has ever managed to ascend to!&rdquo;<br>Zhan Lingtong was endlessly excited. He was so overjoyed; it was as if the person that had managed to ascend to the third level was him.<br>&ldquo;It would seem that geniuses are not only determined by their talent. More than that, it is by their effort.&rdquo;<br>Zhan Lingling&rsquo;s eyes were also filled with shock. At that moment, she was clenching her fists tightly.<br>The reason for that was because she had come to a sudden realization that it was not only her talent that was inferior to Chu Feng&rsquo;s; her effort was also inferior to Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>It was no wonder that she had lived for so many years more than Chu Feng, yet was so much weaker than him.<br>Chu Feng had managed to reach the third level. Upon reaching the third level, he felt relieved.<br>The frightening pressure that was capable of stressing his body and soul to the brink of exploding had disappeared at the same time.<br>The journey upward was truly difficult.<br>However, when Chu Feng saw the scene before him, the place where Zhan Haichuan had trained, and sensed the martial comprehensions contained in the walls, the ground and even the air, he felt that all of it was worth it.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve succeeded. Earlier, your eyes were so fuzzy that I was truly worried that you&rsquo;d fall down again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected those flight of steps to be so difficult to ascend. Even you nearly failed,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen was also overjoyed. The reason for that was because she was truly worried for Chu Feng earlier.<br>As for Chu Feng, he turned around and took a glance at the flight of steps he had just ascended.<br>Bloodstains were still present on the steps. That was Chu Feng&rsquo;s blood. Although there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of blood, it was still present on each and every step.<br>Thus, from a glance, one could tell that Chu Feng had walked through his own blood to ascend the flight of steps.<br>Seeing the flight of steps, Chu Feng sighed emotionally.<br>Suddenly, a smile appeared on his face. He said, &ldquo;The path to becoming stronger has never been that simple.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However&hellip; I am fond of that sort of path.&rdquo;<br><br></p></div>
