        <div> - Anxiety<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Milords, reportedly, it&rsquo;s like this&hellip;&rdquo; The messenger began to inform Chu Hanqing and the others about what had happened.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such a thing?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Hanqinq, Chu Hanyouyou and their accomplices were all shocked.<br>They simply had no information regarding the matter.<br>&ldquo;This matter was presided over by the Starfield Master Realm? In that case, did you manage to see anyone from the Starfield Master Realm?&rdquo; Chu Hanqing asked.<br>&ldquo;I have not seen anyone from the Starfield Master Realm. However, there is a war chariot from the Fang Heavenly Clan. That war chariot is protected by a spirit formation. This subordinate was unable to see through the spirit formation, and does not know if there might be someone from the Starfield Master Realm in there,&rdquo; The messenger said.<br>&ldquo;This is not good at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is no wonder Lord Clan Chief would bring Chu Feng back at a time like this. Evidently, he planned to have Chu Feng face them,&rdquo; At that moment, Chu Hanqing started to frown.<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, what are we to do now? That Fang Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Fang Hualong is not someone that&rsquo;s easy to deal with. There were reports of him being a rank six Martial Immortal in the past. Right now, it&rsquo;s very possible that he has become a rank seven Martial Immortal. Apart from Chu Feng, there is no one in our clan that could possibly contend against him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This matter concerns the control of the Purpletree Ordinary Realm. We cannot afford to lose. Otherwise, we will be cursed by future generations. Should we&hellip; release that Chu Feng first&hellip;&rdquo;<br>After finding out about the matter, the crowd realized that the only person among their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations that was capable of contending against Fang Hualong was Chu Feng.<br>Even though they all wished for his death, even though they were willing to even kill their Lord Clan Chief who shielded him, they still wanted to protect their own honor and reputation.<br>&ldquo;No. We have only managed to put Chu Feng onto the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform with great difficulty, how could we release him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, even if he is released, it&rsquo;s still impossible for him to be a match for Fang Hualong,&rdquo; Chu Hanqing shook his head.<br>&ldquo;This matter is not something that you and I can decide. As this matter concerns the control of the Purpletree Ordinary Realm, Chu Hanpeng will definitely not allow it to be lost so easily. Even if you and I do not wish to release Chu Feng, Chu Hanpeng might still do so,&rdquo; Chu Hanyouyou said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Hanqing&rsquo;s heart tensed. Actually, he was also very afraid that Chu Feng would be released to fight. It would be one thing if he was defeated. However, if he were to win, it would be a great service. With that, Chu Hanpeng might even refuse Chu Feng&rsquo;s punishment.<br>&ldquo;Lord and Lady Supreme Elders, Lord Chu Hanpeng has already left to receive the noble guests. He has ordered this subordinate to tell you all to head there with all haste as well,&rdquo; The messenger said.<br>Chu Hanqing was starting to panic. However, he had no time to think too much. Thus, he waved his sleeve and said, &ldquo;Everyone, leave separately, and then proceed to Chu Hanpeng&rsquo;s location. We cannot allow the fact that we met here to be known.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Hanqing left first.<br>Following that, the people present also began to leave in succession.<br>At that moment, the Fang Heavenly Clan and the other powers were all received into the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>This grandiose group of outsiders entering their Chu Heavenly Clan soon caught the attention of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>In addition to that, Chu Hanpeng had already given the order for the Chu Heavenly Clansmen to gather outside the plaza of the main palace.<br>Thus, in merely a short moment, the outside of the plaza was completely swarming with people. Not only were there people from the older generation present, but the people of the younger generation were also all present. Furthermore, more and more people were rushing over.<br>The main palace&rsquo;s plaza was one of the most sacred plazas of the Chu Heavenly Clan. The Chu Heavenly Clansmen would only be gathered there when something important was to happen.<br>That said, only a small amount of Chu Heavenly Clansmen were in the actual plaza. The great majority of them were outside the plaza. The reason for that was because there were noble guests in the main palace&rsquo;s plaza.<br>There was the Fang Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Supreme Elders.<br>Apart from the grand characters of the Fang Heavenly Clan, there was also the Zhao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the Song Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the City Master of Signal Fire Gate City, and the Sect Master of the Cyan Sword Sect.<br>Those people were all greatly renowned characters with very high status's and identity. Apart from their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Lord Clan Chief, Chu Hanpeng was the only one capable of standing on equal footing with them.<br>That said, these people were not the grand character, for that grand character was still inside the Fang Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s war chariot.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Finally, over a dozen silhouettes walked out from the war chariot.<br>Those people were all emitting extraordinary airs. From a glance, one could tell that they were no commoners, that they were all cultivation experts.<br>As for the leader among them, he was someone that no one dared to look down upon.<br>He was a white-haired old man. He possessed a very tall and strong stature, and was actually over three meters tall. His build simply did not resemble that of an old man. In fact, even his face was rather plump.<br>That old man had a ferocious appearance. Seeing him, one would feel fear. Seeing the title plate on his waist, the hearts of all the Chu Heavenly Clansmen tensed up.<br>&ldquo;Starfield Master Realm. Heavens! That&rsquo;s someone from the Starfield Master Realm! Why would someone from the Starfield Master Realm suddenly come to our Chu Heavenly Clan? Exactly what is happening?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were all very confused and panicky. This was especially true for the people of the younger generation.<br>They were already feeling very uneasy after seeing all those grand characters. Upon seeing the person from the Starfield Master Realm, they were scared witless.<br>After all, the Starfield Master Realm was the ruler of the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Whilst those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations might be very aggressive and overbearing in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they reacted as if they were ordinary civilians seeing an emperor when they saw that person from the Starfield Master Realm. They were so scared that they did not even dare to speak. Their nerves grew so tense because they were afraid that they would be beheaded on the spot should they end up offending that person from the Starfield Master Realm.<br>&ldquo;This subordinate is Chu Hanpeng, I pay my respects to Lord Gangxiong,&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng hurriedly stepped forth to welcome the white-haired old man with a grand show of respect.<br>&ldquo;He is Wuming Gangxiong?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, some of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen&rsquo;s expressions grew even more unsightly.<br>They had heard about Wuming Gangxiong&rsquo;s famous name. In simple terms, he was famous for one thing: being completely unreasonable.<br>If anyone dared to offend him, they would be beheaded on the spot in lesser cases, whereas in more serious causes&hellip; their entire clan would be beheaded.<br>While Wuming Gangxiong was most definitely not the strongest person in the Starfield Master Realm, he was the person whose name brought about the greatest amount of fear.<br>Why would someone as frightening as him appear in their Chu Heavenly Clan?<br>Although they did not know why, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen subconsciously felt that Wuming Gangxiong&rsquo;s appearance was not good.<br>At that moment, the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan were filled with anxiety.<br></p></div>
