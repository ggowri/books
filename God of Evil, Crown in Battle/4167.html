        <div> - Obliterating All<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Irredeemable bastards! If I&rsquo;d known that you would not know repent I would&rsquo;ve killed you all! I shouldn&rsquo;t have allowed you to live till now!&rdquo;<br>A voice sounded from beside Chu Feng.<br>It was not Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice.<br>Looking in the direction of the voice, Chu Feng revealed a look of joy. A familiar figure had appeared beside him. It was Long Daozhi..<br>Long Daozhi was also the person that had seriously injured the eight of them.<br>&ldquo;City Master Long, please spare us!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We were merely trying to scare Chu Feng. We never intended to actually kill him.&rdquo;<br>Realizing that things had gone bad, the four leaders and four world spiritists all knelt and began to beg for forgiveness.<br>They&rsquo;d given up on the idea of fleeing since Long Daozhi&rsquo;s oppressive might had sealed off the region.<br>The only thing they could do now was beg for forgiveness.<br>&ldquo;I can forgive your disrespectfulness towards me. However, to dare act disrespectful towards young friend Chu Feng, none of you shall live.&rdquo;<br>As Long Daozhi spoke, he raised his hand and planned to send forth a palm strike to kill all eight of them.<br>&ldquo;Senior Long, please wait.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly spoke to stop Long Daozhi.<br>Long Daozhi was surprised to hear Chu Feng stopping him.<br>The others were also shocked.<br>They hadn't thought that Chu Feng would plead for leniency for them.<br>But, there was no reason for Chu Feng to plead for them. Could it be that Chu Feng was such a benevolent person?<br>However, to their utter surprise, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;These people have quite strong cultivations. Their source energies will be very useful. Please remember to help me gather their source energies before killing them so that I can have Milady Queen use them when she awakens.&rdquo;<br>It turned out that Chu Feng was not pleading for leniency for them. Rather, he only wanted to collect their source energy.<br>Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, the eight people were so furious that they nearly vomited blood.<br>&ldquo;Very well, we&rsquo;ll do as young friend Chu Feng suggests.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Long Daozhi&rsquo;s palm struck down.<br>His martial power was like sickles and ferocious beasts as it struck the eight people, crushing them to pieces instantly. They had all been killed instantly.<br>After Long Daozhi retrieved his martial power, a spirit formation could be seen on each of his hands.<br>The spirit formations contained different things.<br>One spirit formation contained the treasures of the eight people.<br>As for the other spirit formation, it contained their source energies.<br>Long Daozhi&rsquo;s intention was clear. He wanted to give all of them to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, the items of those four world spiritists might be useful to me. So, I won&rsquo;t hesitate to take them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the other four, they&rsquo;re your fellow clansmen. Perhaps their possessions might be useful to you. Thus, I won&rsquo;t be keeping them.<br>&ldquo;As for the source energies, I need to keep them for Milady Queen. Thus, I won&rsquo;t hesitate to accept them too.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng put away the treasures of the four world spiritists and the eight source energies.<br>Long Daozhi accepted Chu Feng&rsquo;s decision without any objection. He knew Chu Feng&rsquo;s temperament, and knew that if Chu Feng didn't want the four leaders&rsquo; possessions, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to force them on him.<br>Because of that, he kept the treasures of the four leaders.<br>&ldquo;As the saying goes, one should return a gift upon receiving one.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since I&rsquo;ve accepted your gift, I should also return one in kind.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, please have a look at this.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he took out the Dragon Vein Source Stone.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you actually really managed to obtain the Dragon Vein Source Stone?&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi was so emotional upon seeing the Dragon Vein Source Stone that his body began to shiver.<br>Although emotional, he only took a single glance at the Dragon Vein Source Stone before hurriedly putting it away.<br>That Dragon Vein Source Stone was a treasure that could allow him to return to the Dragon Clan.<br>He had to handle it with extreme caution.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I think that the knowledge of this place and the clues should be fake. I believe that there is only one Dragon Vein Source Stone here. The remaining three other Dragon Vein Source Stones simply do not exist,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>According to what Long Daozhi had told him, there should be four Dragon Vein Source Stones.<br>Chu Feng had obtained one. Logically, there should be three more.<br>But, Chu Feng had concluded that the other three Dragon Vein Source Stones did not exist.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, why do you say that?&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi was rather confused by Chu Feng&rsquo;s proclamation.<br>He felt that the people from the Dragon Clan wouldn&rsquo;t have lied to them.<br>&ldquo;I sensed the Dragon Vein Source Stone&rsquo;s aura the moment I entered this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I only sensed the Dragon Vein Source Stone&rsquo;s aura from a single location.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At the beginning I'd thought all four Dragon Vein Source Stones were located here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But now I've found out that there&rsquo;s only a single Dragon Vein Source Stone here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now that we&rsquo;ve obtained this single Dragon Vein Source Stone, I no longer feel any Dragon Vein Source Stone&rsquo;s aura anymore.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of this, I concluded that there shouldn&rsquo;t be another Dragon Vein Source Stone here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course there&rsquo;s another possibility. That is, someone had obtained the other three Dragon Vein Source Stones before we came here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, I think that possibility is very slim.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, the Dragon Vein Source Stones are not so easily obtainable. Although we&rsquo;ve entered the Endless Abyss a bit later than the rest, it&rsquo;s only a bit later. Even if others had managed to discover the Dragon Vein Source Stones, they shouldn&rsquo;t be able to retrieve them so quickly,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That would indeed be quite strange.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, that doesn&rsquo;t matter to us. After all, I only need a single Dragon Vein Source Stone to return to the Dragon Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, it is all thanks to young friend Chu Feng today. Otherwise&hellip; I would have missed this Dragon Vein Source Stone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Long Daozhi, owe young friend Chu Feng an enormous favor. I truly don&rsquo;t know how to repay young friend Chu Feng for all that you&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo;<br>Gratitude filled Long Daozhi&rsquo;s eyes as he said those words.<br>After all, returning to the Dragon Clan had been a dream throughout generations of people of his Ancestral Martial Dragon City.<br>It was all thanks to Chu Feng that they would be able to achieve this dream.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you&rsquo;ve saved my life, and you are my benefactor. There&rsquo;s no need to mention some minor help like this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, senior, how did you find this place? Could you have passed by this place by coincidence?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>Chu Feng felt that it would be understandable to say that he had encountered those eight people by coincidence.<br>But for Long Daozhi to also appear there, it would be too unreasonable to say that his appearance was also a coincidence.<br>&ldquo;I was brought here by that strange tornado,&rdquo; said Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Senior, were you inside that tornado the entire time or did you encounter another tornado afterwards?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I encountered another one.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After being separated from you, I began searching for you. However, I was unable to find your whereabouts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not long afterward, I encountered that strange tornado again. When the tornado dispersed, I managed to sense your aura. Following that, I came here. It just so happened that I arrived at the exact time that those eight bastards tried to kill you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Speaking of it, this is truly quite strange.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It seemed as if that tornado was deliberately sending me here to rescue you,&rdquo; Long Daozhi also felt that things were too much of a coincidence.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. That tornado is truly quite strange.&rdquo; Chu Feng narrowed his brows. He entered a state of deep contemplation.<br>&ldquo;Perhaps it is a coincidence. After all, with how vast this world is, nothing is too strange.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of stories where people encountered strangers that looked the same as their parents, and even had the same names,&rdquo; said Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled upon hearing those words.<br>He felt what Long Daozhi had said was correct.<br>After all, regardless of whether or not that tornado might be a coincidence or some sort of hidden profound mystery, since it had helped them, it was something good.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, do you know how to leave this place?&rdquo; asked Long Daozhi.<br>Now that he had obtained a Dragon Vein Source Stone, Long Daozhi wanted to quickly leave and hand the Dragon Vein Source Stone to the Dragon Clan.<br>&ldquo;Senior Long, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about that. This place only seems dangerous, but it&rsquo;s actually not that dangerous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for leaving this place, the method is actually also very simple.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;According to my observation, all of us will be teleported out of here once the time comes. Even if we wanted to stay we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;How long must we wait?&rdquo; asked Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;It should be soon,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi was extremely happy.<br>Afterwards, they began to wait. Chu Feng and Long Daozhi did not chat excessively.<br>Chu Feng began to examine the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s blood-colored horsetail whisk.<br></p></div>
