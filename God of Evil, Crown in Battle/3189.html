        <div> - Eliminate Bai Liluo<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Say, little brother, didn&rsquo;t big sister already say that she would tell you about it in the future? It&rsquo;s still not the time to tell you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be anxious. When the time is right, big sister will definitely tell you what her origins are,&rdquo; Bai Liluo said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;In that case, do you know how the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen managed to find you?&rdquo;<br>The reason Chu Feng asked that was because he felt that it was very fishy that the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen were able to find them.<br>Furthermore, they were clearly sealed by Bai Liluo earlier. Yet, they were able to escape and find them. This made it even more fishy.<br>That said, Bai Liluo had not interrogated the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen regarding the matter. Instead, she had directly killed them.<br>Chu Feng felt that Bai Liluo might already have some guesses in her mind.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. So what if they discovered me? In the end, didn&rsquo;t they die?&rdquo; Bai Liluo curled her lips disapprovingly.<br>However, Chu Feng noticed a trace of hesitation in Bai Liluo&rsquo;s gaze before she spoke.<br>That hesitation revealed that Bai Liluo was not completely unconcerned about how the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen managed to discover her.<br>It might be that she already knew the reason why they had discovered her, but was deliberately hiding it from Chu Feng.<br>That said, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t continue to press the subject. Bai Liluo had an enormous amount of secrets. If she didn&rsquo;t wish to tell Chu Feng about them, there was nothing Chu Feng could do.<br>There was at least one thing that Chu Feng was certain of - Bai Liluo was not a threat to him at present.<br>Afterwards, Bai Liluo brought Chu Feng out of the underground palace. Furthermore, she sealed the entrance using a spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Well then, little brother Chu Feng, big sister has something to take care of. Thus, I&rsquo;ll be taking my leave first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Big sister will come and find you some time later,&rdquo; after saying that, Bai Liluo left directly.<br>Her speed was very fast. In the blink of an eye, she disappeared. Even now, Chu Feng had no idea what Bai Liluo&rsquo;s cultivation really was.<br>Even after Bai Liluo had left for some time, Chu Feng still showed no sign of leaving.<br>Chu Feng was still pondering. He was thinking and making guesses as to what Bai Liluo&rsquo;s origin was.<br>Unfortunately, with his understanding of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, Chu Feng was simply unable to determine what Bai Liluo&rsquo;s origin was.<br>He also had no idea how she came to possess such overwhelming power.<br>After pondering to no avail, Chu Feng decided to investigate the area. He wanted to see if he could find any clues regarding Bai Liluo&rsquo;s origin there.<br>Chu Feng inspected the surroundings with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes for a very long time. However, he was unable to find anything.<br>Even though Chu Feng knew very well that that place was a sealing ground that contained many secrets, Chu Feng was simply unable to see through it.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm is even more remarkable than I had thought.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng landed on the peak of a mountain and was staring at the vast and boundless mountain range that surrounded him. He had a feeling of powerlessness in his heart.<br>Powerless. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that he was powerless, it would be impossible for him to not obtain anything at a place like that.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, that monster Bai Liluo is exploiting you.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice was heard. It was that strange black silhouette&rsquo;s voice.<br>&ldquo;Who is it? Who is speaking to me?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked all around. However, he was unable to find anyone. That said, that black silhouette was not far from Chu Feng at all. It was merely that Chu Feng was unable to see him.<br>&ldquo;Who I am is not important. What&rsquo;s important is that Bai Liluo will one day kill you and all your friends. In fact, she will destroy the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield,&rdquo; that black silhouette said.<br>&ldquo;Why should I believe you?&rdquo; Chu Feng frowned. Then, he asked, &ldquo;The Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen, they were brought here by you, right?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was on high alert. He had realized that this fellow that he could not see possessed strength surpassing his own.<br>Although he had only spoken a few words to Chu Feng, he had revealed the fact that he wanted to take care of Bai Liluo.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;m the one who led them here. I had thought that they&rsquo;d be able to eliminate Bai Liluo. Never did I expect that Bai Liluo had become much more powerful now. Chu Feng, the only person that can eliminate her now is you,&rdquo; that black silhouette said.<br>&ldquo;Why should I eliminate her? Compared to you, I am more willing to trust her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;If you trust her, you will end up regretting it. Have you not experienced how frightening she is yet? She is capable of ignoring the rule of being unable to kill others in this place, capable of ignoring the power of that spirit formation and directly killing others. In this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, she&rsquo;s the only person capable of doing that. Can you still not tell how terrifying she is?&rdquo; The black silhouette&rsquo;s voice turned anxious.<br>What the black silhouette said was precisely what Chu Feng was thinking. Indeed, Bai Liluo possessed frightening power.<br>At the very least, she was capable of ignoring the protective formation in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. That in itself was something extremely dangerous.<br>&ldquo;I feel that you&rsquo;re quite powerful yourself. Why don&rsquo;t you go and take care of her directly?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;If I were a match for her, I wouldn&rsquo;t have sought out your help. However, if you&rsquo;re willing to help me, I will assist you in eliminating her,&rdquo; the black silhouette said.<br>&ldquo;Your words are only empty claims. No matter how you describe her, based on my own interactions with her, I&rsquo;ve never witnessed her to be a malicious or evil individual. Instead, I&rsquo;ve only witnessed her good side. In fact, she has even saved my life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, you need not say anything anymore. I will not follow your instructions.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng soared into the sky. Even though Chu Feng also wished to know about Bai Liluo&rsquo;s origin, he wouldn&rsquo;t go and take care of her just because of the words of that fellow of dubious origin.<br>&ldquo;Huu~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after Chu Feng soared into the sky, a black whirlwind appeared before him and completely enveloped him within it.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng reacted as if he had lost all strength. He was unable to control his body at all, and could only follow the whirlwind and spin about rapidly.<br>&lsquo;This guy, is he trying to kill me to silence me or what?&rsquo;<br>Although Chu Feng was unable to verify how powerful his opponent was, he was able to tell that his opponent was very strong.<br>Chu Feng felt that if his opponent wished for it, he would be able to kill Chu Feng at any moment.<br>Chu Feng was feeling the threat of death. It seemed that his opponent possessed the same sort of power as Bai Liluo, the power to ignore the protective formation of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm and kill the people inside.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was certain that the mysterious fellow definitely had an extraordinary relationship with Bai Liluo. Furthermore, Bai Liluo should know of his existence.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I truly don&rsquo;t possess any malice. I don&rsquo;t wish to see you being exploited by Bai Liluo and causing the death of more people. For the sake of making you realize the truth, I have no choice but to resort to emergency measures.&rdquo;<br>At the moment when Chu Feng felt that his life was no longer in his hands, that black silhouette&rsquo;s voice sounded again.<br>He did not seem to have the intention to take care of Chu Feng. On the contrary, his tone seemed to be slightly apologetic.<br>During this period of time, the black whirlwind formed by that black silhouette began to rapidly fly in midair.<br>The place where the black whirlwind was proceeding toward was precisely the direction that Bai Liluo had left in.<br></p></div>
