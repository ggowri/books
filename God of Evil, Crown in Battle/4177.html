        <div> - Relying On One&rsquo;s Own Ability<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes started shining when he saw the medicinal pellet.<br>That was no ordinary medicinal pellet used to treat injuries. There was a Dragon Clan&rsquo;s aura lingering around the medicinal pellet. To Long Daozhi and others with the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s bloodline flowing through their bodies, this sort of medicinal pellet would have extraordinary efficacy.<br>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Chu Feng did not refuse such a high quality medicinal pellet.<br>After receiving the medicinal pellet, he immediately fed it to Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;You can give this to him too. Consider it my compensation.&rdquo;<br>As Long Xiaoxiao spoke, she took out a stone and handed it to Chu Feng.<br>That was actually a Dragon Vein Source Stone.<br>&ldquo;Your Highness, you absolutely mustn&rsquo;t. Dragon Vein Source Stones are extremely precious things. This subordinate wouldn&rsquo;t dare accept such a precious treasure,&rdquo; Long Daozhi immediately spoke to decline the offer.<br>The others from Ancestral Martial Dragon City also began to echo him.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that they didn&rsquo;t want the Dragon Vein Source Stone. It was simply that they didn&rsquo;t dare accept it.<br>&ldquo;Take it. This is my compensation to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Apart from this, make sure to properly grasp the next opportunity to return to the Dragon Clan.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Long Xiaoxiao turned around. She was planning to fly to the floating war chariots.<br>&ldquo;Your Highness, please wait.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Long Xiaoxiao was planning to leave, Chu Feng called out to her.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, little benefactor? You need something?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Your Highness, what you said earlier, could you be implying that senior Long and the others will not be able to return to the Dragon Clan this time around?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That is precisely what I&rsquo;m implying. Was I not clear enough?&rdquo; asked Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing that, the expressions of Long Daozhi and the others from Ancestral Martial Dragon City all changed enormously.<br>When they had faced Long Xiaoxiao earlier, they had been too nervous. As such, they didn&rsquo;t think much about the things she said.<br>However, they had managed to hear the conversation between Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao clearly.<br>Since they&rsquo;d received justice and were deemed innocent, why then were they not allowed to return to the Dragon Clan?<br>&ldquo;Your Highness, this isn&rsquo;t right, no?&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong about it?&rdquo; asked Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Senior Long successfully obtained a Dragon Vein Source Stone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;According to the rules your Dragon Clan set in place, shouldn&rsquo;t Ancestral Martial Dragon City be allowed to return to the Dragon Clan?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;But, weren&rsquo;t they toyed with by that Long Tonghe?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for our appearance today, not only would they not have been able to return to the Dragon Clan, but they wouldn&rsquo;t even have been able to survive,&rdquo; said Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;But princess, Long Tonghe was from your Dragon Clan. His crimes could be said to be the fault of your Dragon Clan too,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I know. That&rsquo;s why I compensated him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is that Dragon Vein Source Stone not sufficient as compensation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should know that the reason why I&rsquo;m compensating him is all because I am giving you face.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for you, not to mention compensation, I wouldn&rsquo;t have even given him that medicinal pellet,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao added. She was pointing at Long Daozhi.<br>Her words were extremely frank.<br>She did not care about the feelings of Long Daozhi and the others from Ancestral Martial Dragon City at all.<br>Yet, Long Daozhi and the others from Ancestral Martial Dragon City did not blame this princess.<br>This was the disparity between statuses. None of them dared offend Long Xiaoxiao. From the bottom of their hearts, they felt a sense of servitude toward her.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that you think I must give them justice just because Long Tonghe wronged them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why must I give them justice?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t owe them anything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My hands are full with my own things, I have no time to bother with other people&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the world of martial cultivators, if one wants something, if one wants to obtain something, they&rsquo;ll have to strive and fight for it with their own strength.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He, Long Daozhi, lacked the strength. He cannot blame anyone for his own weakness.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve mentioned that our Dragon Clan will have a similar sort of talent selection to allow people to return to our Dragon Clan in the future.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, whether or not Long Daozhi and his Ancestral Martial Dragon City will be able to return will depend on their own abilities.&rdquo;<br>After hearing her words, Chu Feng was left speechless.<br>Even he felt what she said was very correct.<br>Indeed, in the martial cultivation world, one should not ask others for favors.<br>If one wanted something, one should strive for it, fight for it, with one&rsquo;s own strength.<br>&ldquo;But, if you&rsquo;re willing to help me with one thing, I can make an exception.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I can allow them to directly return to the Dragon Clan without having to go through another selection.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. A different sort of expression appeared in her eyes.<br>Seeing her gaze, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart immediately sunk.<br>It seemed like the girl had planned all of this in advance.<br>It seemed like he had fallen for it.<br>But, even though Chu Feng knew it was a trap, he still asked, &ldquo;What help?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Treat his injuries first. Come find me afterwards.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Long Xiaoxiao turned around and began to walk toward a floating war chariot.<br>As for Chu Feng, he began treating Long Daozhi&rsquo;s injuries. After confirming that his condition was stable, he left to find Long Xiaoxiao.<br>Originally, Long Daozhi didn&rsquo;t want Chu Feng to go and find Long Xiaoxiao.<br>He felt that he owed Chu Feng too much, and did not wish to make him help him again.<br>Furthermore, Long Xiaoxiao was a bizarre girl, and also had an extraordinary identity. Long Daozhi was worried that Chu Feng would encounter troubles.<br>But, Chu Feng insisted on meeting with Long Xiaoxiao. As such, Long Daozhi was unable to stop him.<br>Chu Feng had originally wanted to meet up with Long Xiaoxiao on his own, but Fumo Xin&rsquo;er insisted on following him.<br>Unable to stop her, Chu Feng ended up bringing her along.<br>Normally, outsiders wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed near the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s war chariots.<br>Yet, at that moment no one dared to stop Chu Feng and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>Ignoring the fact that what Long Xiaoxiao had said earlier was heard by everyone present, just the relationship between Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao was already completely obvious to the crowd.<br>Even though they still looked down on Chu Feng slightly, and couldn't comprehend why their noble princess would be so close to such a lowly fellow, they did not dare to stop him.<br>The reason for that was because they were afraid of Long Xiaoxiao.<br>After entering the floating war chariot, Chu Feng saw Long Xiaoxiao again.<br>Long Xiaoxiao told Chu Feng what she needed his help with.<br>Long Xiaoxiao spoke very intimately with Chu Feng. It seemed as if they were very close friends.<br>But, Long Xiaoxiao was extremely cool-headed in the way she handled things.<br>For example, she was totally capable of directly allowing Long Daozhi and the others from Ancestral Martial Dragon City to return to the Dragon Clan.<br>Yet, she did not take Chu Feng into consideration to directly allow them to return to the Dragon Clan.<br>Instead, she insisted on him helping her with one thing. Only then would she allow Long Daozhi and his Ancestral Martial Dragon City to return to the Dragon Clan.<br>Due to Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s personality, she also did not give Chu Feng the full details about what she needed his help with.<br>Chu Feng only knew that she needed his help with something concerning world spirit techniques.<br>Moreover, Long Xiaoxiao had a condition -- Chu Feng needed to successfully help her complete the task.<br>Only then would she allow Long Daozhi and Ancestral Martial Dragon City to return to the Dragon Clan.<br>If Chu Feng failed or did not help her much, Long Xiaoxiao would not allow Long Daozhi and Ancestral Martial Dragon City to return.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think too much of it, and accepted her conditions.<br>After all, he had always felt that he and his Chu Heavenly Clan owed Long Daozhi too much.<br>After all, Long Daozhi was someone that had saved them.<br>He was also able to tell how much Long Daozhi longed to return to the Dragon Clan.<br>Even though what Long Xiaoxiao said was very true, and returning to the Dragon Clan should be up to Long Daozhi&rsquo;s own abilities, that didn&rsquo;t mean that all the people in the Dragon Clan were extremely powerful.<br>That was absolutely not the case!<br>In terms of strength and cultivation, whilst Long Daozhi&rsquo;s strength would not be ranked amongst the top in the Dragon Clan, he was most definitely not the weakest either.<br>Flowing through his body was the blood of the Dragon Clan. He was a member of the Dragon Clan to begin with.<br>It was only because his forefathers had received unfair treatment that they had ended up being banished from the Dragon Clan.<br>Fate had been unkind to Long Daozhi and Ancestral Martial Dragon City.<br>Chu Feng only wanted to do what he could to help him.<br>Thus, even though he didn't know the details, Chu Feng still agreed to help Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;You really agreed to it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let me make things clear. This matter is dangerous, and could be potentially fatal. Furthermore, it is very troublesome.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to fail or die, I will not take you helping me or your death into consideration to aid Long Daozhi.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is a business transaction between you and I.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A transaction is a transaction. I will not bring personal feelings into consideration.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you fail to help, it will mean just that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will not show any sympathy to your cause.&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao emphasized her stance after seeing that Chu Feng agreed to help her without any hesitation.<br></p></div>
