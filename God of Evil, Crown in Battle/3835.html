        <div> - Red-dress Holy Land<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meng Rufei felt as if he was about to die from excessive anger. However, there was nothing he could do.<br>After all, the person Yin Zhuanghong had been waiting for was indeed Chu Feng.<br>Furthermore, the reason why Yin Zhuanghong was waiting for Chu Feng was because she wanted to invite him to visit the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>This caused Meng Rufei to feel even more displeased. Yet, he was still unable to say anything about it.<br>After all, he had already learned that Chu Feng was a person of the younger generation that was even more outstanding than him. Furthermore, Yuan Shu was his patron. No matter how displeased Meng Rufei might be, he would, at least on the surface, not dare to set himself against Chu Feng.<br>If he truly dared to cause trouble for Chu Feng at such a time, he would truly be asking for trouble for himself.<br>As for the invitation, since Yin Zhuanghong was so enthusiastic about it, something very rare for her, Chu Feng would naturally not refuse to give her face. Thus, he decided to accompany her.<br>Just like that, Chu Feng, Yin Zhuanghong, Meng Rufei and Zhang Duotuo journeyed together to the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>What sort of place was the Red-dress Holy Land? That was the power that Yin Zhaunghong belonged to.<br>The Red-dress Holy Land did not have any men. From headmaster to elders to disciples, they were all women.<br>The red dress was the symbol of the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Although the Red-dress Holy Land was composed of only women, they were not to be looked down upon. They were the fully-deserving overlords of the Reincarnation Upper Realm.<br>In fact, they were so powerful that they were acknowledged throughout the entire All-heaven Starfield.<br>As for Yin Zhuanghong, she was someone who possessed an extraordinary status in the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>She was the personal disciple of the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster, and also the only Holy Daughter of the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Her status had practically established her future position. She was basically the successor to the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>It was no wonder that Yin Zhaunghong was so popular in the All-heaven Starfield. Even geniuses like Nangong Yifan were completely infatuated with her.<br>Thinking about it, how could anyone not be fond of a woman who possessed status, talent, strength and beauty?<br>As for the reason why Zhang Duotuo and Meng Rufei were accompanying them, Chu Feng had asked Yin Zhuanghong. However, Yin Zhuanghong did not directly tell him the reason. She merely said that her master had invited them.<br>According to Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess, the Red-dress Holy Land wouldn&rsquo;t make such an invitation without reason. For Zhang Duotuo and Meng Rufei to be invited as guests, it was likely that the Red-dress Holy Land had something to ask of them.<br>Otherwise, with Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s personality, how could she be so courteous toward Zhang Duotuo and Meng Rufei?<br>Of course, this was merely Chu Feng&rsquo;s personal guess.<br>After journeying for some time, Chu Feng managed to catch sight of the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>The Red-dress Holy Land was a bizarre place composed of enormous floating interconnected islands.<br>There were many floating waterfalls on the islands. From a glance, they resembled silver dragons leaping down from the sky. It was truly a magnificent sight.<br>Compared to trees, there were more flowers on the islands.<br>There were many different types of flowers. However, without exception, they were all red.<br>Flowers filled the various floating islands. From afar, they seemed like a series of red flowers blooming in the skies within the clouds. They were so beautiful that one would be enchanted by them.<br>Although the scenery was extremely beautiful, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s disciples were also different from Chu Feng&rsquo;s imagination.<br>Chu Feng had thought that in a paradise-like place like that, the people would all be celestial fairies like Yin Zhuanghong.<br>However, the truth was different.<br>Take the elders guarding the extremities of the floating islands as an example; although they all wore red and were gorgeously dressed, they all had very robust builds, like a whole bunch of burly men. Furthermore, their facial appearances were simply unbearable to look at.<br>They appeared so fierce that &lsquo;tigress&rsquo; was no longer capable of describing them. It would be more suitable to address them as yakshas.<br>After entering the Red-dress Holy Land, Chu Feng encountered all sorts of women.<br>There were women so fat that they resembled balls, women so thin that they resembled sticks, women with skin so dark that it seemed like they were dyed in ink, and women with faces covered in pimples or pockmarks.<br>Although the Red-dress Holy Land was also abundant in beautiful women, there were more of these unprepossessing and even ugly women.<br>Truly too curious, Chu Feng was finally unable to contain himself, and asked Yin Zhuanghong after he was settled in a guest suite, &ldquo;Girl, as the saying goes, everyone loves beauty. Why doesn't your Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s women fix their appearances?&rdquo;<br>As martial cultivators, changing one&rsquo;s appearance was simply as easy as turning over one&rsquo;s hand.<br>Why were there so many beauties in the martial cultivation world?<br>Actually, the majority of them were women that had fixed their appearances using special techniques. It wasn&rsquo;t that there weren&rsquo;t any natural beauties. However, very few were as beautiful as Yin Zhaunghong.<br>It was precisely because altering one&rsquo;s appearance was such an effortless task that Chu Feng became very curious as to why the women from the Red-dress Holy Land were willing to face others using their actual appearances.<br>&ldquo;My master has taught us from a young age that we must be true to ourselves," said Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What else could there be?&rdquo; asked Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng let out a mischievous laugh. Then, he asked, &ldquo;Will they receive any punishment should they alter their appearances?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip;&rdquo; Yin Zhuanghong hesitated momentarily. Then, she said, &ldquo;They would.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the smile on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face grew more intense. He said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no wonder then. This is an enforced requirement. If the punishment were removed, do you think they&rsquo;d continue to maintain their current appearances?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s best that you don&rsquo;t meddle in other people&rsquo;s business," as Yin Zhuanghong spoke, she tossed a map to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng opened the map and discovered that it was a map of the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>However, the Red-dress Holy Land was enormous. As for the map, it showed less than a hundredth of the entire area of the Red-dress Holy Land. Thus, Chu Feng asked, &ldquo;Girl, what is this?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The places on the map are places you can go to. As for the places not on the map, you must not go there. Otherwise&hellip; not even I will be able to save you,&rdquo; said Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;Girl, I came here as a guest, not to be a prisoner," Chu Feng said with a look of grievance.<br>Yin Zhuanghong felt somewhat apologetic, and began to explain to Chu Feng after hearing his complaint, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing that I can do about it. This place is the Red-dress Holy Land. For some rules, even our headmaster will have to comply with them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough, I am merely joking with you. I am a rather well-behaved person, I will not run all over the place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead of that, how about you tell me why you sought out Grandmaster Yuan Shu? Furthermore, why were Zhang Duotuo and Meng Rufei invited over by you?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng. He was truly curious.<br></p></div>
