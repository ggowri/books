        <h1>Chapter 1871</h1>
        <div> - Absolute Expert<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Nangong Longjian?!!!&rdquo; Hearing that name, the crowd were all startled. This was especially true of the people of the Nangong Imperial Clan. At that moment, they displayed extremely excited expressions. They had already managed to recognize that enormous golden dragon sword.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the enormous golden dragon sword that was floating in the sky started to shrink. In a flash, it became much smaller. Although it was small now, the might it was emitting did not decrease in the slightest. Then, it shot toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Crap!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, Zhang Ming and the others were all alarmed. They shouted in their hearts. The reason for that was because that golden dragon sword was truly too frightening. When even they were incapable of withstanding it, if that sword were to strike at Chu Feng, even if Chu Feng possessed a hundred lives, he would still definitely be killed.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right when that sword was about to strike Chu Feng, it suddenly shifted directions. Then, a palm appeared from the space in front of Chu Feng. That palm grabbed the golden dragon sword.<br>Immediately afterward, a man walked out from the void and stood before Chu Feng.<br>This man had a head of hair that reached his waist. His hair was pitch-black, it was as dark as ink. As it fluttered in the wind, he appeared to be extremely extraordinary, and gave off an incomparably domineering air.<br>Merely by looking at him, one could tell that he was an absolute expert. As for this man&hellip; he was Nangong Longjian.<br>&ldquo;Nangong Longjian, it really is Nangong Longjian!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Then, that golden dragon sword is the legendary Heavenly Golden Dragon Sword?!&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing Nangong Longjian, many people became extremely excited. Today, they had truly managed to broaden their horizons. They had managed to see so many grand experts. One must know that those that they saw today were all legends they were incapable of seeing even if they wanted to.<br>&ldquo;This aura, Nangong Longjian, he actually reached a breakthrough and became a rank six Martial Emperor. Haha&hellip; today, Chu Feng is definitely going to be killed.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan were overjoyed. The reason for that was because they only knew Nangong Longjian as a rank five Martial Emperor. However, the aura that Nangong Longjian was emitting right now was that of a rank six Martial Emperor. This meant that Nangong Longjian had reached a breakthrough.<br>Nangong Longjian had always been the pride of the Nangong Imperial Clan. The more powerful Nangong Longjian became, the more powerful their Nangong Imperial Clan would be. Now that Nangong Longjian had stepped onto the stage, who could possibly do anything to them? No matter how many experts Chu Feng invited over to help him, they would all be killed here. As such, how could the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan not feel joy?<br>Not to mention the Nangong Imperial Clan, the people from the other three Imperial Clans were also extremely excited. After all, they were all Imperial Clans, and were of the same root.<br>&ldquo;Nangong Longjian, you actually dared to attack me. You are truly arrogant.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, seeing that you are also a talent, I will not bicker with you about it. Come, join our Dark Hall,&rdquo; The Dark Hall&rsquo;s expert said. Although he had possessed overflowing killing intent earlier, he had removed his killing intent right now. With a beaming smile on his face, he invited Nangong Longjian to join him. The change in his mood was astonishingly fast.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, at that moment, Nangong Longjian suddenly pointed his Heavenly Dragon Golden Sword at the people from the Dark Hall.<br>Although he merely pointed his sword at them casually, it caused all of heaven and earth to immediately begin to tremble. Following that, another dragon roar sounded, and an enormous golden dragon&rsquo;s image flew out from the Heavenly Golden Dragon Sword. With its mouth wide open, it arrived before the people of the Dark Hall. It was as if that golden dragon was going to devour them the very next moment.<br>&ldquo;Leave or die!&rdquo; Nangong Longjian said those words with a very cold tone.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well, Nangong Longjian, you have balls,&rdquo; Hearing those words, the expression of the man from the Dark Hall changed. However, in the end, he led the experts from the Dark Hall, turned around and left.<br>&ldquo;Longjian, you have come at the perfect time. Quickly, kill that Chu Feng and his accomplices! They have killed a lot of people from our Four Great Imperial Clans. Today, they must be killed!&rdquo; Nangong Beidou said with a loud voice.<br>However, Nangong Longjian suddenly narrowed his sword brows and shouted at Nangong Beidou, &ldquo;You, shut up!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Longjian, you!!!&rdquo; Being berated by Nangong Longjian in public, Nangong Beidou felt extremely humiliated. However, at that moment, he did not dare to say anything else. Merely, his complexion turned ashen, and his expression became extremely ugly.<br>He had always disliked Nangong Longjian. However, Nangong Longjian&rsquo;s strength was truly too powerful. Right now, he had become so powerful that the continued existence of the Four Great Imperial Clans would have to rely on him. Even though he deeply disliked Nangong Longjian, he had no choice but to yield to him.<br>&ldquo;I already know why the Four Great Imperial Clans are targeting Chu Feng. It&rsquo;s merely because you are all afraid of Chu Feng&rsquo;s power. In the end, it&rsquo;s the Four Great Imperial Clans that are in the wrong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While it is true that there have been some casualties among the Four Clans today, this is the result of forcing Chu Feng into a corner repeatedly. This is the result that you have all brought upon yourselves.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, there are a lot of people present. As such, I shall be the intermediary. You all will reconcile,&rdquo; Nangong Longjian said.<br>&ldquo;Nangong Longjian, what nonsense are you spouting? Are you still a fucking member of our Four Great Imperial...?!&rdquo; A Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder shouted angrily.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before he could even finish saying his words, Nangong Longjian waved his sleeve. Then, that Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder was swatted from the sky and ruthlessly smashed into the ground. After crashing into the ground, his body became badly mutilated and he fainted on the spot.<br>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m speaking, you are not to interrupt,&rdquo; Nangong Longjian said with a cold voice. His gaze was ice-cold and without the slightest trace of emotion.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo; Seeing this scene, the people from the Ximen Imperial Clan were so enraged that their complexions turned ashen. They clenched their fists tightly, but did not dare to say anything. The reason for that was because Nangong Longjian was truly too strong.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Nangong Longjian is actually not killing Chu Feng, and is instead urging for peace? Furthermore, he attacked the Ximen Imperial Clan?&rdquo; At this moment, the crowd were all confused by what had happened.<br>Not to mention the bystanders, even Zhang Ming, Duan Jidao and the others were confused as to why Nangong Longjian was helping Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, only Chu Feng had an idea as to why Nangong Longjian was helping him. When he saw the powerful black-haired man before him, Chu Feng recalled a single person: Bai Ruochen.<br>Unless it was because of Bai Ruochen, Chu Feng could not think of another reason why Nangong Longjian would help him.<br>&ldquo;Today, I, Nangong Longjian, shall say it like this: those who agree to reconcile shall live. Those who refuse shall die.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>After Nangong Longjian said those words, he suddenly raised the Heavenly Golden Dragon Sword in his hand high up into the air. The very next moment, that golden dragon&rsquo;s image appeared once again. Merely, this time around, that dragon was even more enormous. As it coiled above the skies, it covered the entire region.<br>The might of the dragon bathed the land below it and enveloped everyone present. That vast dragon&rsquo;s might caused the crowd to all feel extremely uneasy.<br>Although Nangong Longjian&rsquo;s action was different from those of that Dark Hall&rsquo;s expert, and did not possess overflowing killing intent, the crowd all knew very well that their lives were within Nangong Longjian&rsquo;s grasp. [1. I just noticed, Nangong Longjian&rsquo;s name is&hellip; South Palace, Dragon Sword. I guess that&rsquo;s why he has a dragon sword.]<br>With a single thought, he could kill hundreds of millions of lives. With a single sword, he could pierce through the vast heavenly dome.<br>This&hellip; was a rank six Martial Emperor. This&hellip; was Nangong Longjian. This&hellip; was a true absolute expert.<br>&ldquo;Four Great Imperial Clans, are you all willing to reconcile?&rdquo; Nangong Longjian asked.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo; The people from the Ximen Imperial Clan were all gnashing their teeth in rage. This was especially true for Ximen Baiyuan. At that moment, his complexion was both green and white and his expression was extremely ugly.<br>As for the people of the Nangong Imperial Clan, they were at a loss as to what to do. They truly did not expect that their own clansman would actually not help them after appearing, but would instead force them to reconcile.<br>However, upon thinking about it, this was also reasonable. Although Nangong Longjian was the Nangong Imperial Clan&rsquo;s pride, he had never been someone who cared about their Nangong Imperial Clan&rsquo;s honor and reputation. Else, the Nangong Imperial Clan would have already risen in power. How could they possibly still be standing on equal footing as the other three Imperial Clans?<br></p></div>
