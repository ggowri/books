        <div> - Eight Formations Forever Opened<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this old man&rsquo;s fault. It is this old man who told Chu Feng that he must choose to comprehend his bloodline&rsquo;s power should the choice present itself to him.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice sounded. Turning toward the voice, the crowd discovered that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Chu Hanpeng had returned.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s this old man&rsquo;s fault. I shouldn&rsquo;t have made that decision for you,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had an ashamed expression as he blamed himself.<br>He felt that the cause for the situation at hand was because of his reminder to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, how could you be blamed? That is clearly my decision. It had nothing to do with you at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I wanted to experience the true might of my bloodline&rsquo;s power to begin with.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, my talent is limited, and I only managed to gain very superficial enlightenment.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If someone must be blamed, then one can only blame me for having insufficient ability.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had no intention to blame the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had only advised him out of good intentions. There was no reason for him to blame the Clan Chief.<br>That said, Chu Feng&rsquo;s current state was not very good either.<br>Chu Feng was disappointed, disappointed in himself.<br>Chu Feng had thought that even if he was unable to activate seven Bloodline Cultivation Formations like his father and grandfather, he should be able to activate five or six Bloodline Cultivation Formations.<br>In fact, Chu Feng had still had this sort of confidence when he walked out of the Bloodline Cultivation Formation.<br>Although it was extremely difficult to comprehend how to control his bloodline&rsquo;s power, and practically impossible to gain complete mastery over it, he had managed to gain some results.<br>Merely, he never expected that even though he had gained results, he was unable to even activate a single Bloodline Cultivation Formation.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng realized how difficult it was to comprehend one&rsquo;s bloodline&rsquo;s power.<br>He felt that it would appear that he had only managed to gain superficial comprehension.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, regarding this&hellip;&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief still wanted to explain.<br>He wanted to place the responsibility on himself so as to not burden Chu Feng mentally.<br>&ldquo;As the Bloodline Altar has closed, we cannot continue to linger in this forbidden area.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All clansmen, you are to leave this forbidden area right now.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Hanpeng&rsquo;s stern voice was suddenly heard.<br>He was actually trying to help the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief out of that difficult situation.<br>Although the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had revealed the truth, was blaming himself and wanted to wholly take the fault of everything as his responsibility, it remained that he was their Clan Chief, the leader of their Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>As the leader, it was truly unbefitting for him to apologize to a person of the younger generation before all their clansmen. As such, Chu Hanpeng felt that he had to stop it.<br>Once Chu Hanpeng&rsquo;s words left his mouth, the crowd began to leave. Even Chu Feng left.<br>At that moment, only the upper echelons of the Chu Heavenly Clan who possessed both status and qualifications to remain in the forbidden area remained.<br>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s something you want to say, you can do that with Chu Feng privately. To say those words before all the clansmen, it&rsquo;s truly inappropriate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No matter what, Chu Feng is a person of the younger generation. How could you, before everyone, and especially the people of the younger generation, apologize to Chu Feng like that?&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng said to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. He did not try to conceal his feelings of rebuke toward him.<br>However, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief merely sighed. Then, his body shifted, and he disappeared.<br>The crowd present all knew that he must&rsquo;ve gone to seek out Chu Feng.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was truly feeling ashamed and apologetic regarding the matter. He truly blamed himself for all it.<br>&ldquo;Actually, this matter cannot be blamed on Lord Clan Chief. It can only be said that Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent is still insufficient.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Forget about it. What happened has already happened, it&rsquo;s useless for us to continue to linger on this topic. Everyone, it&rsquo;s time to disperse.&rdquo;<br>The others present all sighed. Afterwards, they began to leave.<br>At that moment, inside the entire forbidden area, apart from those people that were undergoing closed-door training within the forbidden area, only Chu Hanpeng and Chu Xuanzhengfa remained.<br>&ldquo;What happened today will be a major shock to Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng arrived beside Chu Xuanzhengfa and spoke with an emotional sigh.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, this will be a major shock to him. After all, this happened before so many people. Furthermore, everyone had placed such high hopes on him. However, I believe that Chu Feng, with his mentality, will be able to adjust to this. Merely&hellip;&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa turned his gaze toward the Bloodline Altar.<br>&ldquo;Merely, the Bloodline Altar today is truly acting strange,&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng also turned his gaze toward the Bloodline Altar.<br>Normally, the lightning that covered the Bloodline Altar would completely disappear after it closed. The lightning would only be present when the Bloodline Altar was active. However, there was still surging lightning covering the Bloodline Altar.<br>Although it was not a lot of lightning, it was still present.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a loud explosion sounded from below the Bloodline Altar.<br>Looking toward the direction of the explosion, Chu Hanpeng and Chu Xuanzhengfa noticed that there was thick smoke surging from below the Bloodline Altar.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Hanpeng&rsquo;s expressions changed enormously. They had no idea why such a thing was happening.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Immediately afterward, another explosion was heard. Furthermore, enormous cracks began to appear on the Bloodline Altar. The cracks were still spreading.<br>&ldquo;Oh no! Something&rsquo;s wrong with the Bloodline Altar!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I must inform Lord Clan Chief of this matter right away!&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa immediately planned to leave to inform the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>However, right after he finished saying those words, Chu Hanpeng lamented, &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t make it in time.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa immediately turned back around. Upon doing so, he heard another ear-piercing explosion. Following that, the Bloodline Altar collapsed completely. Soon, thick smoke filled the entire sky. As for the Bloodline Altar, it turned into a pile of yellow sandy soil that scattered onto the ground.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! How could this be?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Xuanzhengfa had an ashen expression. He was in utter panic.<br>The Bloodline Altar could be said to be one of the most important and most precious places in the Chu Heavenly Clan. Yet, it was actually shattered. Not to mention him, this was extremely dreadful for the entire Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>At the moment when Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Hanpeng were stunned by the scene before their eyes, the Bloodline Cultivation Formations began to shine with miraculous light.<br>The Bloodline Cultivation Formations were actually activated. Furthermore, it was not only a single one, but rather all eight of them simultaneously.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; exactly what is happening?&rdquo;<br>Not to mention Chu Xuanzhengfa, even Chu Hanpeng was completely bewildered by this scene.<br>The Bloodline Altar was the source that activated the Bloodline Cultivation Formations. Now that the Bloodline Altar had been destroyed, why would the Bloodline Cultivation Formations open? Furthermore, all eight of them opened simultaneously?<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>At the moment when Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Hanpeng had complicated expressions on their faces, and were completely confused as to whether they should rejoice or lament, the sandy yellow soil that the Bloodline Altar shattered into began to flicker with brilliant light and started to gather in the empty sky.<br>Soon, the shining yellow soil formed several large characters in midair in the center of the eight Bloodline Cultivation Formations.<br>&lsquo;The day when the bloodline is comprehended,<br>Shall be the day when the altar is invalidated...<br>And the eight formations&hellip; shall forever open!&rsquo;<br></p></div>
