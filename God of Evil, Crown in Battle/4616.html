        <div>: Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Holy shit! Brother, you can&rsquo;t really only be at rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation, can you?&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan looked at Chu Feng with his mouth agape as he spoke the words that the crowd wanted to ask themselves.<br>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.<br>Chu Feng was initially a little awkward about this, but when everyone found out about it, his awkwardness mysteriously vanished. Perhaps it was because he was thick-skinned, but he actually found the crowd&rsquo;s response interesting even.<br>However, the crowd shared very different thoughts about this matter.<br>They simply couldn&rsquo;t make sense of how someone of Chu Feng&rsquo;s prowess could have possibly obtained a slot in the trials.<br>&ldquo;Brother, how did you clear the trials? It can&rsquo;t be that you have connections here, right? Are you actually a relative of Lord Black Demon?&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan was quite a brave one to dare to run his mouth, asking all sorts of inappropriate questions.<br>&ldquo;Cough cough, it&rsquo;s probably just luck,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Nonsense! How could you possibly clear that kind of trials by luck? Hurry up and confess! How did you sneak in here?&rdquo;<br>Those of the Gongsun Clan looked at Chu Feng with deep displeasure as they interrogated Chu Feng with a sharp voice. It was clear that they were taking this matter very seriously.<br>After all, Chu Feng had taken away one of the slots that should have belonged to the juniors of the Gongsun Clan. There was no way they would view him favorably.<br>&ldquo;Sneak in here?&rdquo; Chu Feng repeated with a cold smile. &ldquo;Are you doubting Lord Black Demon&rsquo;s judgment over here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>The faces of the prodigies of the Gongsun Clan turned awful. They were intending to get back at Chu Feng for daring to steal the slots of their kin, but who could have thought that the latter would refute their claims so fearlessly and even bring the Wretched Black Demon into this.<br>How could juniors like them possibly dare question the Wretched Black Demon&rsquo;s judgment?<br>They didn&rsquo;t think that they would get roped in just like that and end up in this awkward situation.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for words. Focus on the test.&rdquo;<br>It was at this moment that an elder&rsquo;s voice sounded from the spectator stand where the Gongsun Clan was situated. The elder had white hair but a well-built body, which added to his authoritative presence.<br>He was no other than the clan chief of the Gongsun Clan.<br>It might appear that the Gongsun Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was berating his own clan members, but in truth, he was freeing them from the awkward situation they had put themselves in.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. Youngsters like them should be free to speak whatever they want. How stifling it would be if they were to watch everything that they say as the old ones do?&rdquo; the Wretched Black Demon spoke up with a smile, thinking nothing to the matter.<br>The test continued after this short intermission.<br>Six of the seven prodigies of the Gongsun Clan stepped onto the elevated platform, and surprisingly, they weren&rsquo;t as powerful as Chu Feng thought them out to be.<br>Of them, three were at rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation whereas the other three were at rank three.<br>From this, it could be seen that the Gongsun Clan had actually intentionally dispatched three of the stronger prodigies over to the Incubation Forest in order to secure the slots there.<br>It was just a pity that things didn&rsquo;t go according to their wishes. They ended up losing all three of their rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritists just like this.<br>&hellip;<br>Finally, it was time for the seventh prodigy of the Gongsun Clan to take the test.<br>When he leaped onto the elevated platform, Chu Feng noticed some changes in the gazes of the older generation experts. There was anticipation gleaming in their eyes.<br>Weng!<br>Weng!<br>Weng!<br>Weng!<br>Weng!<br>Five light dragons burst forth from the elevated platform, revealing the strength of the seventh prodigy. He was actually a rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist!<br>That would make him equivalent to a rank one Martial Exalted level cultivator!<br>&ldquo;As expected of Gongsun Yuntian. To think that he has already reached rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation!&rdquo; Xia Yan exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;Ah, he&rsquo;s Gongsun Yuntian? No wonder,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked.<br>He finally knew why everyone was waiting so expectantly for him to leap onto the elevated platform. Song Yun had once told him that there were two highly talented world spiritists in the Nine Souls Galaxy.<br>One of them was Zhuge Feiluan, and the other one was Gongsun Yuntian.<br>It was just that the two of them had gone into closed-door training for a long time, so no one knew exactly how strong they were right now. Who could have thought that Gongsun Yuntian had already come out of his closed-door training and even reached rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation?<br>His strength was more than enough for him to tower over all of his peers.<br>Chu Feng was glad that he wasn&rsquo;t interested in the Wretched Black Demon&rsquo;s granddaughter, or else he would really be despairing right now.<br>&ldquo;Brother, you can&rsquo;t possibly not know Gongsun Yuntian too, right?&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan looked at Chu Feng in astonishment. Even though Chu Feng was only muttering to himself, he still heard Chu Feng&rsquo;s words loud and clear.<br>&ldquo;Ah, I just remembered that you&rsquo;re from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. But even if you&rsquo;re from elsewhere, aren&rsquo;t you a little too ignorant for a world spiritist? Bro, it won&rsquo;t do for you to be like this! You&rsquo;re like a frog in a well, you know!&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan laughed heartily as he struck Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulder.<br>His words were spoken out loud, such that everyone present could hear him.<br>When everyone realized that Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t even know Gongsun Yuntian, all sorts of gazes began falling upon Chu Feng. The gazes coming from the Gongsun Clan carried a tinge of displeasure and hostility.<br>This left Chu Feng feeling a little helpless.<br>Xia Yan was really channeling the ire of the crowd onto him.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Yuntian, it&rsquo;s no wonder you&rsquo;re famed to be one of the most outstanding world spiritists of our Nine Souls Galaxy. However, I should tell you that you aren&rsquo;t guaranteed victory in this matchmaking convention just because you have reached rank five Dragon Transformation Sensation. The test I&rsquo;ve prepared is not as easy as what you all have in mind.&rdquo;<br>The Wretched Black Demon raised his hand, and a pillar of golden light rose to the sky. The pillar of golden light gradually expanded as its radiance grew more and more blinding.<br>It morphed into a massive palace that covered the entire sky.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wow. That would really make things interesting.&rdquo;<br>Looking at the humongous palace in the sky, Xia Yan remarked in wonderment.<br>&ldquo;Brother, what is the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>Gathering intelligence was part of the battle. It would definitely be to his benefit to gain some knowledge about the Thousand Transformations Illusory Palace beforehand.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I said that you&rsquo;re a frog in the well. To think that you don&rsquo;t even know this treasure from Lord Black Demon! Well, I can tell you if you really want to know, but don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s only fair for you to reciprocate? I have a condition,&rdquo; Xia Yan said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;A condition?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt that it was a little ludicrous. It was just a mere question, but Xia Yan wanted to raise conditions with him. Nevertheless, he was still interested to hear what Xia Yan had in mind.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your condition?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bro, let&rsquo;s work together.&rdquo;<br>Xia Yan relayed these words to Chu Feng through voice transmission.<br></p></div>
