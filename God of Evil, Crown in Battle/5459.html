        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;Plunder the world spirits of others? You mean you can turn other people&rsquo;s world spirits into yours?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s exactly it,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.</span><br><span>&ldquo;But what if the world spirit refuses to heed your command?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>Unlike martial skills and secret skills, world spirits were living beings that possessed a will of their own.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I can seal off the world spirit&rsquo;s will and control them like a puppet,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s interesting.&rdquo; Eggy&rsquo;s eyes widened in excitement. She was fond of such domineering means. However, she quickly thought of something and asked, &ldquo;Are there restrictions to it?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The more powerful a skill was, the more likely it would have restrictions attached to it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not too sure about it. I haven&rsquo;t gotten a chance to try it yet. I suspect that it might not be that easy to pull off, especially against enemies who are significantly stronger than I am. It might also fail on enemies who have a strong connection with their world spirit. It&rsquo;s hard to say till I really give it a try,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to see it. Chu Feng, why don&rsquo;t you find someone to try it on?&rdquo; Eggy </span><span>rubbed her hands together in anticipation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milady Queen, I can&rsquo;t just try it on</span><br><span>anyone</span><br><span>, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no big deal. Just compensate that person afterward or something then!&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was rendered speechless. He didn&rsquo;t think that he was a good person, but there were principles that he strictly abided by. He wouldn&rsquo;t steal other people&rsquo;s martial skills and world spirits without any reason. He would only make a move on someone when he was certain that the latter had done wrong.</span><br><span>Admittedly, he wanted to see the prowess of the secret skill too.</span><br><span>All of a sudden, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes lit up. &ldquo;Now that I think about it, I can try it on myself.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Try it on yourself?&rdquo; Eggy was confused. &ldquo;How does that work?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Eggy, do you still remember Descent of the Demon Exalted?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course I do. That&rsquo;s the secret skill Blood-devouring Demon Exalted imparted to you, right? That arrogant fellow kept calling you trash and refuses to bow to you even to this day,&rdquo; Eggy scoffed in displeasure.</span><br><span>However, she soon thought of something, and her eyes lit up in excitement. &ldquo;Are you thinking of imposing your control on Descent of the Demon Exalted through your secret skill?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Theoretically it should work. I&rsquo;ll have to try to know for sure,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he activated Dark Plunder once more.</span><br><span>Moments later, a sinister black aura furiously gushed out of his body till it reached a height of beyond a hundred meters. If not for the fact that he was in an enclosed space, the black aura would have likely expanded even larger.</span><br><span>A massive blue silhouette emerged from the black aura. It stood at more than a hundred meters in height, making Chu Feng look insignificant in comparison. It had a humanoid body covered in gashes, but its two hundred-meters-long bull horns and giant bat wings that spanned ten times its body width showed that it was a monstrous beast.</span><br><span>It was shrouded in a black aura different from that of Chu Feng&rsquo;s secret skill. It looked at Chu Feng with chilling cold eyes reminiscent of a death god, but the latter remained unfazed.</span><br><span>He looked at the monstrous beast and said, &ldquo;Descent of the Demon God, we meet again.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brat, did you think that you can control just because you have gotten yourself a secret skill? You&rsquo;re underestimating me. You still don&rsquo;t understand how big the world is. Don&rsquo;t even think that you can put me on a leash just because you have advanced your cultivation. I am not as weak as you think I am. I suggest you stop eyeing me, or else it&rsquo;ll just spell your doom.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Descent of the Demon God remained disdainful even though its attitude was slightly better than before.</span><br><span>Whoosh!</span><br><span>The metallic clanking of chains could be heard. It was Chu Feng&rsquo;s secret skill, Dark Plunder.</span><br><span>Dark Plunder initially surrounded the Descent of the Demon God in the form of a black aura, but a part of the black aura morphed into chains that bound the latter.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brat, how dare you make a move on this Exalted? You&rsquo;re courting death!&rdquo; the Descent of the Demon God roared in anger. It raised its hand to slap Chu Feng off.</span><br><span>However, the further tightening of the chains prevented it from landing its attack. In fact, its body started to twist and distort under the tight squeeze of the chains. It was finally starting to dawn on it that Chu Feng&rsquo;s secret skill was not to be trifled with, and its face turned grave.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I know that you are no ordinary secret skill, and that&rsquo;s why I desired you so much back then. But times have changed. You are no longer important to me. I won&rsquo;t force you to submit to me anymore.&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes turned cold. &ldquo;You can vanish from this world now.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng waved his arm.</span><br><span>Several more black chains manifested out of the black aura, but this time around, they had incomparably sharp tips. They impaled the body of the Descent of the Demon Exalted, causing blood to spurt everywhere.</span><br><span>Fear could be seen reflected in the Descent of the Demon Exalted&rsquo;s eyes. Somehow, it felt completely helpless against the secret skill, as if it was its natural bane. It wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do a thing at all even if the secret skill took its life.</span><br><span>Most important of all, it felt Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing intent. He wasn&rsquo;t just joking around when he said that he was going to kill it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Wait, Chu Feng! Don&rsquo;t kill me!&rdquo; the Descent of the Demon Exalted exclaimed.</span><br><span>Chu Feng ignored it. With a wave of his arm, several more chains manifested out of the black aura and pierced through the Descent of the Demon Exalted&rsquo;s body.</span><br><span>The Descent of the Demon Exalted weakly fell to its knees.</span><br><span>However, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t fazed in the least. He coldly waved his hand once more, and several more black chains manifested out of the black aura.</span><br><span>Seeing that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t going to let it off at all, the Descent of the Demon Exalted cried in a panic, &ldquo;Chu Feng, I had no choice! It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want to submit to you, but the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted doesn&rsquo;t allow me to do so! It&rsquo;s all his scheme! I&rsquo;m nothing but a pawn to him!&rdquo;</span><br></p></div>
