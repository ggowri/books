        <div> - Enormous Shock<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;We cannot sit and remain indifferent to big brother Chu Luyang being killed. No matter what, he is a member of our Chu Family.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why our Chu Heavenly Clan will not concern themselves with this matter is because of the rules set up by our Ancestor stating that we are not allowed to interfere with the matters that occur in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, us fellow clansmen who are also tempering ourselves in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm cannot disregard this matter,&rdquo; A middle-aged man said.<br>That man was over eighty years old. Although he could still barely be considered a member of the younger generation, his age was comparatively old among the people of the younger generation. As for his cultivation, it was inferior to even Chu Feng&rsquo;s; he was only a rank two Half Martial Ancestor.<br>&ldquo;We cannot disregard this matter? How are we supposed to concern ourselves with this matter? Our cultivations are inferior to big brother Chu Luyang&rsquo;s. As for that bastard Chu Feng, he was able to kill even big brother Chu Luyang. How are we supposed to avenge him?&rdquo; Another tan-skinned man said.<br>He was also a member of the younger generation. Merely, his cultivation was even weaker than the other man&rsquo;s; he was only a rank one Half Martial Ancestor.<br>&ldquo;You all are truly lacking in gathering intelligence,&rdquo; Right at that moment, a white-haired old man stood forth.<br>This old man&rsquo;s name was Chu Luotang. His cultivation was that of a rank three Martial Ancestor. Furthermore, he was close to five hundred years old. Among this group of people, he was the oldest member. He was also the most renowned individual among them.<br>Thus, after Chu Luotang stepped forward, the clansmen of the Chu Heavenly Clan that were ceaselessly debating with one another all quieted down.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Luotang, could it be that you&rsquo;ve received some sort of information?&rdquo; Someone asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Chu Luotang smiled lightly.<br>Then, he said, &ldquo;We will naturally have to avenge Chu Luyang. Merely, there is simply no need for us to act at all. The reason for that is because not only has that Chu Feng killed Chu Luyang, he has also killed Ying Liangchen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I believe that brothers and sisters all Know who Ying Liangchen is right? He is the most beloved son of the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, the Ying Heavenly Clan has already posted an order for Chu Feng&rsquo;s capture. They are determined to avenge Ying Liangchen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Regardless of how powerful that Chu Feng might be, it would be impossible for him to be a match for the Ying Heavenly Clan. After all, the Ying Heavenly Clan is a clan that wields a Heavenly Bloodline. Although they are incapable of matching our Chu Heavenly Clan, they possess some strength in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right. I have also heard of that matter,&rdquo; Once Chu Luotang said those words, many people began to confirm that they had also heard such news.<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, Chu Luyang is a member of the Sunset Cloud Valley. The Sunset Cloud Valley will not disregard the death of Chu Luyang. I&rsquo;ve heard that Chu Feng was arrested by people from the Sunset Cloud Valley that day.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that information is true, it might be possible that there would simply be no need for the Ying Heavenly Clan to act. Not long from now, the news of Chu Feng being killed by the Sunset Cloud Valley will start to spread,&rdquo; Chu Luotang continued.<br>&ldquo;What big brother Luotang says is very reasonable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, the Sunset Cloud Valley will definitely not remain indifferent. Perhaps there will simply be no need for us to worry about it and the Sunset Cloud Valley will take care of that Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, we have truly worried for nothing.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Luotang said those words, the rest of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen present all began to voice their agreement. Finally, smiles appeared on their previously worried faces.<br>Suddenly, someone asked, &ldquo;Merely, big brother Luotang, you said that Chu Feng was captured by the Sunset Cloud Valley. Is that really true?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have already had my men confirm that matter. Likely, we will know whether or not it is true very soon,&rdquo; Chu Luotang said confidently.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, it is big brother Luotang who thinks things through thoroughly,&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation began to praise Chu Luotang in succession.<br>After a series of praises, Chu Luotang revealed a complacent smile.<br>&ldquo;Milord,&rdquo; Not long afterward, a shout was heard from afar.<br>It was a black-clothed man. He was an expert with the cultivation of a peak Half Martial Ancestor. He was not a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan. Instead, he was Chu Luotang&rsquo;s subordinate.<br>Thus, even though the black-clothed man possessed a cultivation stronger than many of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation present, he still hurriedly greeted them with a respectful bow after approaching them.<br>&ldquo;How was it? Did you manage to gain any information?&rdquo; Chu Luotang asked. The rest of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen also looked to that black-clothed man with anticipating gazes.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I have,&rdquo; The black-clothed man said.<br>&ldquo;Has Chu Feng been captured by the Sunset Cloud Valley?&rdquo; Chu Luotang asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, that is absolutely certain. Chu Feng was indeed captured by the Sunset Cloud Valley,&rdquo; The black-clothed man said.<br>&ldquo;Good. That Chu Feng deserves to die. Like this, big brother Luyang can be considered to have been avenged.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng is truly daring. He actually dared to kill a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan. Likely, he also knew that our Chu Heavenly Clan would not concern themselves with the lives and deaths of our members in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. That is why he dared to act so unscrupulously.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately for him, he had no idea that big brother Chu Luyang had already obtained a backer in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. As for his backing, it was the Sunset Cloud Valley.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now that Chu Feng has been captured by the Sunset Cloud Valley, he will likely not be able to escape death. He has reaped what he has sown. Serves him right.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan present were all overjoyed. It was as if they had heard the news of Chu Feng&rsquo;s death.<br>It was only Chu Luotang that remained calm. He did not urgently come to a conclusion, and instead continued to ask, &ldquo;Then what is the situation of that Chu Feng now? Has he been killed by the Sunset Cloud Valley?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He has not,&rdquo; That black-clothed man said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng was actually not killed?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the expressions of the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan all grew stiff as their smiles instantly froze.<br>&ldquo;If the rumors are true, the people of the Sunset Cloud Valley should have arrived promptly that day, and witnessed Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing of Chu Luyang. With irrefutable evidence, why would the Sunset Cloud Valley still leave Chu Feng alive? Exactly what is up with the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Law Enforcement Department? Do they not know how to do their jobs?!&rdquo; Chu Luotang asked furiously.<br>He was unable to understand why the Sunset Cloud Valley would keep Chu Feng alive.<br>&ldquo;Milord, as for the exact reasons, this subordinate is also uncertain. Merely&hellip; the Sunset Cloud Valley has already made a declaration,&rdquo; The black-clothed man said.<br>&ldquo;What sort of declaration?&rdquo; Chu Luotang asked.<br>&ldquo;The Sunset Cloud Valley claims that Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing of Ying Liangchen was justified, that Ying Liangchen deserved to die. They have also declared that if the Ying Heavenly Clan insists on killing Chu Feng, the Sunset Cloud Valley is willing to declare war on the Ying Heavenly Clan on behalf of Chu Feng,&rdquo; The black-clothed man said.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Those words came like a sudden clap of thunder to the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan. They felt as if their brains were about to explode. Some of the members of the younger generation that lacked the ability to endure shock felt their bodies grow soft before falling down onto their butts.<br>What was going on?<br>Wasn&rsquo;t the Sunset Cloud Valley Chu Luyang&rsquo;s backer?<br>Why would the Sunset Cloud Valley not avenge Chu Luyang and kill Chu Feng, but instead start to stand up for Chu Feng?<br>Exactly what was going on?<br>At that moment, the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan were all struck dumb. They were truly unable to understand why such a thing would happen. They felt as if they had received an enormous shock.<br>&ldquo;Has the Sunset Cloud Valley gone mad? They are actually willing to declare war against the Ying Heavenly Clan for a mere Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if the Sunset Cloud Valley possesses a deep background in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, the Ying Heavenly Clan is also not a power that one can trifle with. If the two of them are to declare war on one another, both sides will suffer.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Sunset Cloud Valley is actually willing to declare war against the Ying Heavenly Clan for someone that they possessed no relationship with before? Have their heads been kicked or what?!&rdquo; Chu Luotang gnashed his teeth with rage as he shouted loudly.<br>&ldquo;Milord, that declaration was jointly declared by the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall; the Three Stars Hall is also planning to back Chu Feng,&rdquo; That black-clothed man added.<br>&ldquo;Three Stars Hall? The Three Stars Hall is actually also planning to help Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen present that were already shocked by the news earlier received an enormous shock once again.<br><br></p></div>
