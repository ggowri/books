        <h1>Chapter 5037</h1>
        <div>: Coerced<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sima Xiangtu stood with an air of majesty, as if he was the patriarch of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. At his command, the troops who had drawn their swords quickly sheathed their blades.<br>From their terrified expression, it was clear that Sima Xiangtu had obtained actual authority over the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>&ldquo;Young master Kongping, what brings you here?&rdquo;<br>Sima Xiangtu stepped forward and spoke with a respectful attitude.<br>This made the crowd realize that Jiang Kongping wasn&rsquo;t an impersonator. He was truly a young master from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, or else Master Yin Ren wouldn&rsquo;t have treated him so courteously.<br>A huge commotion broke out amidst the crowd.<br>News spread quickly. Even those who had never heard of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect swiftly learned about the behemoth through the discussions of those around them.<br>But why would a young master of the lofty Pill Dao Immortal Sect suddenly appear in the Nine Souls Sacred Clan?<br>&ldquo;Sima Xiangtu, do you still remember me?&rdquo; Jiang Kongping asked.<br>&ldquo;Who is Sima Xiangtu? Did he get the wrong person?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was confused as to how Jiang Kongping was addressing Master Yin Ren. After all, they were still unaware of Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s true identity.<br>Sima Xiangtu ignored the crowd and replied with a courteous smile, &ldquo;What are you saying, young master Kongping? How could I possibly not remember you?&rdquo;<br>That made the crowd realize that Jiang Kongping was indeed speaking to Master Yin Ren, but they weren&rsquo;t too surprised by that. It was just a name, after all. Sima Xiangtu could simply be an alias that Master Yin Ren used elsewhere.<br>Since Master Yin Ren had acknowledged it, there was no need for them to think too deeply into it.<br>&ldquo;Not bad. It looks like you still know your place. Stand there for a moment and wait for me. There are some things I need to tell this bunch of trash.&rdquo;<br>With that, Jiang Kongping cast his gaze toward the cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy who had traveled from far and wide to obtain Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s pill.<br>Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. He sensed that Jiang Kongping was going to do something inappropriate, but he chose not to stop him. In his eyes, the cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy were of little importance as compared to Jiang Kongping.<br>If Jiang Kongping wanted to kick up a fuss, so be it.<br>Jiang Kongping had no intention of holding back. Before everyone&rsquo;s eyes, he cleared his throat once more, pointed a finger at Sima Xiangtu, and said, &ldquo;Trash of the Nine Souls Galaxy, listen well. Sima Xiangtu is a despicable scum!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; What is he saying?&rdquo;<br>Everyone was shocked to hear those words. Even Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s complexion darkened as well. He couldn&rsquo;t understand why Jiang Kongping was suddenly turning against him.<br>&ldquo;Young master Kongping, what do you mean by this?&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu asked.<br>However, Jiang Kongping berated him coldly, &ldquo;Shut your mouth. Did I allow you to speak?&rdquo;<br>He then turned his gaze back to the crowd and continued, &ldquo;Did you think that he&rsquo;s feeding all of you pills to help you raise your cultivation? I can tell you frankly that he&rsquo;s going to use you as ingredients for his pill concoction after you consume what he gave you. He&rsquo;s treating you as nothing more than a cultivation resource!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s using us as ingredients for pill concoction? What a joke. We&rsquo;re cultivators! How could we possibly be used as ingredients for pill concoction?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why is that young master talking nonsense?&rdquo;<br>Despite Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s shocking revelation, there was hardly anyone who believed his words. Instead, most people thought that he was uttering nonsense.<br>After all, they were cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy. It was hard to believe that their overseers, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, would use them as ingredients for pill concoction. Such a thing had never happened before.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already said everything I want to. It&rsquo;s up to you whether you want to believe my words or not.<br>&ldquo;As for those from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, I want you to listen well. I don&rsquo;t know what Sima Xiangtu did to make all of you listen to him like loyal dogs, but your clan chief has become Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s prisoner and is currently being held in that prison over there.<br>&ldquo;Sima Xiangtu has imprisoned your clan chief, but you still chose to serve him as lackeys and aid him in harming the cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy. Touch your own conscience and ask yourself if you&rsquo;re worthy of being members of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan!&rdquo; Jiang Kongping spat.<br>&ldquo;Is he&hellip; out of his mind? How dare he utter such atrocities?&rdquo;<br>A huge commotion broke out amidst the crowd upon hearing those words.<br>However, the members of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan looked at one another with complicated looks on their faces. Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s words had sparked some thoughts in their minds.<br>In the first place, Sima Xiangtu was only able to command them due to an order from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. The latter had entrusted his Clan Chief Token to Sima Xiangtu, ordering everyone in the Nine Souls Sacred Clan to heed Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s orders.<br>Most of them thought that it was ridiculous and didn&rsquo;t want to submit to Sima Xiangtu. Not to mention, Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s deferential attitude toward a youngster who had put down their Nine Souls Galaxy further stirred their displeasure.<br>It was just that they didn&rsquo;t want to go against their clan chief&rsquo;s orders.<br>However, one had to remember that Jiang Kongping was a young master of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. There was no reason for him to utter such words without reason, no matter how illogical they sounded. Could there be some veracity behind them?<br>Such a thought surfaced in the minds of many members of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>Even Chu Feng was surprised by Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s performance.<br>He was the one who instructed Jiang Kongping to say those words as he thought that it would be better for the latter to make an appearance, but he was almost certain that the latter would pull some tricks to go against his order.<br>Yet, Jiang Kongping actually obediently did as he was told.<br>Furthermore, Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s attitude was much more arrogant than Chu Feng had expected. Sima Xiangtu appeared to be nothing more than a servant before him.<br>&ldquo;Why did Jiang Kongping obediently say whatever you told him to? This is weird.&rdquo;<br>Even the reticent Yu Sha was surprised by the happenings.<br>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t the kind to obediently listen to others&rsquo; orders. He&rsquo;s probably up to something. However, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. The formation linking the two of us is extremely stable. I&rsquo;ll make him pay the price if he dares to pull anything off,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Young master Kongping, I have no grudge with you. Why must you sully my innocence with such false accusations,&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu asked.<br>&ldquo;Sima Xiangtu, shouldn&rsquo;t you know better than anyone else whether what I&rsquo;m saying is true or not? To be honest, I can&rsquo;t care less about what you&rsquo;re doing, but someone coerced me into it,&rdquo; Jiang Kongping said.<br></p></div>
