        <div>: Chu Feng&rsquo;s Goal<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Fear? Could it be that&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantain revealed complicated looks on their faces. It was now clear to them that it was impossible for the Heavenly Bloodline inside the pearl to fuse together with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;There could only be one reason for a Heavenly Bloodline to show fear&mdash;the Heavenly Bloodline in Chu Feng&rsquo;s body must have been even stronger. In other words, he doesn&rsquo;t need this Heavenly Bloodline. Even if he wants it, the Heavenly Bloodline inside him wouldn&rsquo;t accept it,&rdquo; the Holy Monarch said.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng is indeed formidable,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said with a beaming smile.<br>He was initially frustrated by the notion of giving such a formidable Heavenly Bloodline to Chu Lingxi instead of Chu Feng, but it turned out that even this Heavenly Bloodline wasn&rsquo;t worthy of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng is the pride of our Holy Light Galaxy, but someone actually went to all lengths to kill him at the very start,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said with a rare mischievous smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;Oi, Niantian! It was just a lapse in judgment back then. I was too obsessed with trying to guard the honor of our Holy Light Clan that&hellip; Ha&hellip; I really have to rein in this hot temper of mine.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei rolled his eyes at Daoist Niantian before sighing at his own shortcomings. If there was one thing he regretted the most in his entire life, it would be nearly taking Chu Feng&rsquo;s life in a moment of folly.<br>If only he had been willing to befriend Chu Feng at the very start, their relationship might have been much closer.<br>&ldquo;Baimei, I understand how you feel. Chu Feng might be a prodigy, but he ultimately isn&rsquo;t a member of our Holy Light Clan. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be much better if our Holy Light Clansmen brought our Holy Light Galaxy to the peak of the world of cultivation instead?&rdquo; the Holy Monarch said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Holy Monarch, that would be for the best, but&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to be a wet blanket, but the juniors of our Holy Light Clan are indeed lacking compared to the top prodigies in the world of cultivation,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said with a sigh.<br>The Holy Monarch burst into laughter. He then turned his sights to Daoist Niantian.<br>&ldquo;Niantian, you should be able to tell that the items on the list are nourishing in nature. Aren&rsquo;t you curious to know who I am giving them to?&rdquo; the Holy Monarch asked.<br>&ldquo;Is Lord Holy Monarch not going to give them to Chu Lingxi?&rdquo; Daoist Niantian asked in surprise.<br>He thought that they were reserved for Chu Lingxi, but the Holy Monarch&rsquo;s words suggested something else.<br>&ldquo;They are prepared for the juniors of our Holy Light Clan,&rdquo; the Holy Monarch replied.<br>&ldquo;The juniors of our clan?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian were surprised to hear that. It was not to say that there was anything wrong with what the Holy Monarch was doing, just that it was a little abrupt.<br>&ldquo;Back then, before our ancestors departed, they left us with a clan-protection treasure. They sternly instructed us not to use the treasure unless many prodigies appear in the same era or an extremely talented individual emerges. That&rsquo;s how powerful the clan-protection treasure is.<br>&ldquo;Just like how the Heavenly Bloodline will allow Chu Lingxi to undergo a metamorphosis, the treasure left behind by our ancestors will allow our juniors to do the same too. Now that God&rsquo;s Era has already begun, I think it&rsquo;s time for us to use it,&rdquo; the Holy Monarch said.<br>&ldquo;Are you serious, Lord Holy Monarch?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei was exhilarated to hear that. It was his first time getting so excited. The current juniors in their Holy Valley were already outstanding as they were. If they were to be further buffed by the treasure, it was hard to imagine just how powerful they would get in the future.<br>This could be the chance for his Holy Light Clan to rise in the world of cultivation.<br>&ldquo;Of course I am serious. That&rsquo;s also the reason I have called you back. Our Holy Light Clan has lied low for far too many years; it&rsquo;s time for us to shine once more. Our juniors shall take back the glory of our ancestors!&rdquo;<br>The Holy Monarch looked at the sky and continued on, &ldquo;For many years, our Holy Light Clan has been neglected by the other powers, and that&rsquo;ll be even more so now that God&rsquo;s Era has begun. However, I&rsquo;ll show them who the true stars of God&rsquo;s Era are.&rdquo;<br>&hellip;<br>Chu Feng waited for more than ten days in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, but the phenomenon showed no signs of ending. It didn&rsquo;t look like Zi Ling was coming out of closed-door training any time soon.<br>Based on what he had observed, the results of Zi Ling&rsquo;s closed-door training would be extraordinary, but for the same reason, it was likely to take a long time.<br>Due to that, Chu Feng decided not to wait anymore. Instead, he entrusted two letters two Duan Liufeng. One was for Zi Ling whereas the other was an apology letter to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster. After all, he had taken Yaoyao without permission.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you need not feel too pressured by that. The day you took Yaoyao away, Lord Sectmaster didn&rsquo;t utter a word of criticism about you. She didn&rsquo;t even lose her temper,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said with a smile.<br>Chu Feng was moved to hear that.<br>While the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster always maintained a stern appearance, she treated him extremely well.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, feel free to do whatever you need to. I dare not guarantee anything else, but you can be certain that Zi Ling and Yaoyao will be safe in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said.<br>There were many things Chu Feng wanted to say to Duan Liufeng, but he didn&rsquo;t want to make it a sorrowful parting. He simply put on a grin and clasped his fist, saying, &ldquo;Farewell, Brother Duan.&rdquo;<br>Duan Liufeng smiled in response.<br>&ldquo;Go on. You have never been the type to idle about. No matter what you&rsquo;re up to, you must make sure to return safely,&rdquo; he said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;ll take a lot to bring me down,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>He left the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect and returned to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, where he reunited with Song Yuwei. However, they didn&rsquo;t head to the Totem Galaxy right away.<br>There was something Chu Feng wanted to do.<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s disfigurement had been bugging his mind for the longest time, but he finally had the ability to heal her now. Naturally, it was only right for him to do so before he set off.<br>Thus, he made his way to the Dragon Clan.<br>To his surprise, Long Xiaoxiao, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, and Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother were not in the Dragon Clan. It turned out that Long Xiaoxiao had been afflicted with a mysterious illness on the day Chu Feng left. No matter how they tried to treat her, it was futile.<br>She was mostly in an unconscious state, but every night, she would raise her hand and point at the starry sky above. For some reason, the direction she would point at every single time was none other than where the Totem Galaxy was.<br>It was one thing if such a matter only occurred once or twice, but it happened every single night. She would always point in the correct direction regardless of the celestial movements.<br>That led the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to think that the cure to Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s illness lay in the Totem Galaxy. Thus, he brought Long Xiaoxiao to the Totem Galaxy.<br>It was just that the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was unfamiliar with the Totem Galaxy. He told others that he was heading to the Totem Galaxy, but he wasn&rsquo;t sure where he was going. Naturally, he also didn&rsquo;t know when he would return either.<br>That put Chu Feng at a loss. He was worried about Long Xiaoxiao, but there was little for him to work with here.<br>It was fortunate that his goal also lay in the Totem Galaxy. If fate permits, he might just be able to gather some news about Long Xiaoxiao there.<br>Thus, he immediately set off to the Totem Galaxy with Song Yuwei. In contrast to the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Long Xiaoxiao, he had a clear destination in mind&mdash;the True Dragon Upper Realm of the Totem Galaxy&rsquo;s True Dragon Starfield.<br>The ruler of the True Dragon Starfield was the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>They entered an ancient teleportation formation, and after a long journey, they finally arrived at their destination. The moment Chu Feng&rsquo;s feet fell on the foreign land, he felt flames igniting his heart.<br>This was the land where the culprits who drove his grandmother insane dwelled in.<br>&ldquo;Situ World Spiritist Clan, I will be unworthy to be a human if I don&rsquo;t erase your name from the vast world of cultivation!&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured silently under his breath.<br>That was the next goal he had set for himself.<br></p></div>
