        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Challenge<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once Chu Feng said those words, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen&rsquo;s expressions all changed.<br>At that moment, they were filled with endless excitement. It was as if their long-silent passion had finally been roused.<br>Excited, how could they not be excited?<br>Become the ruler of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm?<br>That sort of thing was something that they had not even dared to imagine before.<br>After all, in the past, they were the most bottom-tier existence in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, and had received all sorts of bullying and humiliations.<br>To become the ruler and receive the reverence of the various powers, that was truly something that none of them had dared to imagine.<br>However, at that moment, the thing that they did not even dare to dream of appeared to already be within reach, and would soon become true.<br>Thinking of this, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen no longer hesitated. With excitement, they walked into the spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>However, when the Chu Heavenly Clansmen passed through the spirit formation gate and saw their surroundings, they all stood there stunned. Not only did panic fill their faces, but they also began to shiver involuntarily.<br>Fear. When they saw the scene before them, when they saw the people all around them, the excitement in their hearts disappeared. The only thing that remained was the feeling of fear.<br>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen felt as if they were lambs that had entered the tiger&rsquo;s den.<br>When they saw the experts from the Linghu Heavenly Clan, they suddenly started to doubt whether Chu Feng was truly capable of defeating those people.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve returned so quickly?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, a voice was heard. It was Linghu Tiemian.<br>Linghu Tiemian and the people from the various powers had all left their honored guest seats and had arrived at the center of the plaza.<br>They were all toasting, drinking and chatting merrily.<br>Of course, it was also Linghu Tiemian who gave the order to use their spirit formation to invade the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s main city.<br>According to his words, he wanted to gather that bunch of trash over there to liven things up.<br>When they saw the Chu Heavenly Clansmen walking out from the spirit formation gate in an orderly manner, many people from the Dongguo Heavenly Clan and the Li Heavenly Clan revealed worried expressions.<br>The reason for that was because they all knew that those Chu Heavenly Clansmen would end up suffering.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, one by one, figures flew out of the spirit formation gate.<br>After those people landed on the ground, they began to roll and crawl on the ground.<br>Upon seeing those people, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed. This was especially true for the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, as they immediately stood up nervously.<br>The reason for that was because the people that were tossed from the spirit formation gate were none other than their Linghu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>They were their fellow clansmen that Linghu Tiemian had ordered to capture the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?!&rdquo;<br>This question filled everyone&rsquo;s hearts.<br>Why would the people that were captured walk out of the spirit formation gate safely, whereas the people that had gone to capture them were tossed out in such a miserable manner?<br>&ldquo;Yoh, that food looks quite decent. Is that feast prepared to welcome me? If that&rsquo;s the case, why did you all begin to dine before I arrived? Such behavior is quite unacceptable, no?&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the crowd was astonished, a figure slowly walked out of the spirit formation gate and arrived before the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>Upon seeing that person, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed.<br>At that moment, it was not only the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen that were standing up. The others present also all stood up from their seats.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a furious shout was heard.<br>It was Linghu Tiemian. The reason he shouted was because the person that had arrived was none other than Chu Feng.<br>At this moment, Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s suppressed anger finally exploded.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Why are you so excited to see me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Linghu Tiemian.<br>At that moment, another person from the Linghu Heavenly Clan said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, never would I have imagined that you would dare to show up here.&rdquo;<br>The Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were all very surprised. They were surprised at how Chu Feng dared to walk right into their feast, knowing full well that they were looking for him.<br>Although they had no idea of what sort of purpose Chu Feng had in mind, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were determined to not let Chu Feng get away now that he had appeared before them.<br>&ldquo;Was it truly that unexpected? I clearly recall that I had someone pass on my message to you all, telling you all to obediently wait for me because I would soon come and find you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that he didn&rsquo;t pass on my message?&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng suddenly turned his gaze to a Heaven-reaching Beast Clansman. He asked, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you pass on my message?&rdquo;<br>The person Chu Feng questioned was precisely the person that Chu Feng had placed his spirit formation on.<br>When that Heaven-reaching Beast Clansman saw Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze, he immediately felt extremely afraid. When he heard Chu Feng&rsquo;s cold question, he became so scared that his face turned pale. Immediately, he explained, &ldquo;I passed on your message. I told them all what you wanted me to say.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, you have come here today to challenge us?&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian asked coldly.<br>Linghu Tiemian was no longer extremely furious. The reason for that was because he found it truly laughable after he verified that Chu Feng had truly come to challenge them.<br>The reason for that was because Linghu Tiemian felt that Chu Feng simply did not possess the capability to contend against him.<br>Even though Chu Feng had defeated many of their Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s geniuses, he would still be nothing more than trash before him; Linghu Tiemian.<br>&ldquo;Challenge? If you say it like that, it would be somewhat correct. However, it&rsquo;s not fully correct,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? In that case, why don&rsquo;t you tell me what about it is correct, and what about it is incorrect.&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian asked.<br>Linghu Tiemian considered Chu Feng to be nothing more than a clown. He did not mind if he bounced around a couple more times and played a couple more tricks. After all, in the end, Chu Feng would die by his hands.<br>The more arrogantly Chu Feng acted, the more humiliating his fall would be.<br>As for that, it was precisely what Linghu Tiemian wanted.<br>He, Linghu Tiemian, would retrieve all the disgrace that they&rsquo;d suffered at Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands.<br>&ldquo;It makes sense for you to say that I&rsquo;ve come to challenge you. After all, my purpose in coming here is very clear. I will drive your Linghu Heavenly Clan out of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s Overlord Region,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing what Chu Feng said, all the bystanders and Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were astonished.<br>What audacity. Chu Feng was truly audacious.<br>He actually dared to provoke the Linghu Heavenly Clan like that before all those people. That was simply too reckless, too daring, too audacious.<br>That said, Chu Feng reacted as if he was unable to see the shocked expressions of the crowd, and continued, &ldquo;Of course, if you all are willing to scram of your own accord, I will not have to personally make you scram. Should that be the case, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a challenge of any sort. Say, don&rsquo;t you think that what I said is correct?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng looked to Linghu Tiemian with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly, Linghu Tiemian burst into loud laughter.<br>Merely, Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s laughter was very cold and gloomy. In fact, when he laughed, killing intent was emitted from his laughing face.<br>Being affected by his killing intent, the sunny and cloudless sky became filled with black clouds and rolling thunder. It was as if doomsday had arrived.<br>The bystanders were all frightened by this. The Dongguo and Li Heavenly Clansmen all felt very worried for Chu Feng.<br>As for the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, they all turned pale with fright.<br>Only Chu Feng remained as calm and collected as ever. He continued to have that faint smile on his face.<br></p></div>
