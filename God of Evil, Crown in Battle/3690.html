        <div> - The Spar Begins<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, since you&rsquo;ve agreed to it, shall we begin now?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked. She was truly itching to spar with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment.&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he made hand seals and released spirit power from within his body. Like spring water, the spirit power moved throughout his body.<br>After being covered by his spirit power, the injuries that covered his body disappeared in an instant. Even his clothes were repaired.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, he was deliberately allowing himself to sustain injuries.&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing that, the crowd verified that the injuries Chu Feng had sustained fighting those experts were taken deliberately.<br>After all, since Chu Feng was able to so effortlessly cure those injuries, it meant that those injuries were not serious at all.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin,&rdquo; Chu Feng said after curing his injuries.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, let me experience your sword techniques first.&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi flicked her wrist, and a pink sword appeared in her hand.<br>That sword was extremely exquisite. It seemed like it was especially created for her.<br>Most importantly, that sword gave off an overwhelming aura. That sword was not only an Incomplete Exalted Armament, but it was a top quality Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>&ldquo;Come.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng held the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword and pointed it at Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, Chu Lingxi disappeared. When she reappeared, she had arrived before Chu Feng.<br>The pink sword in her hand was thrust towards Chu Feng&rsquo;s neck.<br>Her thrust was extremely fast, extremely accurate, extremely fierce and sharp.<br>Before the sword reached Chu Feng, the aura emitted by the sword had already arrived. Chu Lingxi was not playing around. She was serious in her match against Chu Feng.<br>However, Chu Feng was no ordinary individual either. He did not use the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword in his hand to block the incoming attack. Instead, he thrust his Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword toward Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s neck.<br>In the blink of an eye, Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s sword had arrived before Chu Feng. However, with a slight movement of his body, Chu Feng dodged the sword thrust.<br>At the same time as he dodged the attack, Chu Feng&rsquo;s own sword arrived before Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s neck.<br>Faced with such a fatal attack, Chu Lingxi only moved her body slightly, and also easily avoided it.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng praised her. &ldquo;Say, Lingxi, your techniques have gotten much stronger.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, it has only just begun. If you want to praise me, it wouldn&rsquo;t be too late to praise me later.&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi smiled sweetly. Confidence filled her beautiful face.<br>Although the two of them were talking cheerfully and sounding like they were play fighting, their weapons were not playing at all. The two of them were exchanging sharp attacks against one another. Momentarily, they were stuck in a stalemate.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng felt increasingly surprised.<br>Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s progress was simply too fast. Even though he did not go all-out, he still fully acknowledged her strength.<br>Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s sword techniques were extremely marvelous, and not ordinary attacks at all. It was obvious that she had fully focused herself on mastering sword techniques.<br>To be able to gain such a high mastery over sword techniques fully revealed how extraordinary her comprehension ability was.<br>However, that was not what was important. The main point was that Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s battle power was extremely strong.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword had a similar attribute to Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>However, even though their weapons were so similar, neither he nor she were beaten back when their weapons collided.<br>This meant that Chu Lingxi had extremely strong battle power. Even if her battle power was weaker than Chu Feng&rsquo;s, it would only be slightly weaker.<br>At the very least, her battle power was much stronger than those geniuses from the Three Cities.<br>In fact, her battle power was even much stronger than Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s.<br>Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s battle power had practically reached the peak of rank three Exalted.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that I cannot continue to go easy on you.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that it would be difficult to reach an outcome if the current situation were to continue, Chu Feng decided to go all-out.<br>&ldquo;Clank, clank, clank~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng changed his attack patterns. He began to force Chu Lingxi to have no choice but to block his Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword with her Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>With that, the two weapons began to collide and send forth sparks repeatedly. Chu Lingxi was also being beaten back.<br>Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power after using his full strength was only slightly stronger than Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s, it was sufficient to cause Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s arm to go numb. If this were to continue, she would find it very difficult to persist against Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a Heaven character started to flicker on Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s forehead.<br>Once the Heaven-level Lightning Mark appeared, Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s cultivation immediately increased.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>At practically the same time, a Divine-level Lightning Mark appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead.<br>The two of them had increased their cultivations from rank three to rank four Exalteds at the same time.<br>&ldquo;Damn it. Big brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re simply bullying me.&rdquo;<br>Even though their cultivations had both increased by a level, the battle only grew more difficult for Chu Lingxi.<br>There was nothing that could be done about that. After all, the Divine-level Lightning Mark had a suppressive ability towards Heaven-level Lightning Marks.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing that I can do about that. This is the Mysterious Technique that I trained in. You can&rsquo;t possibly tell me to not use it, no?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng replied with a beaming smile. That said, his smile was truly vile.<br>&ldquo;Humph, don&rsquo;t you act so pleased. Although I am no match for you in terms of my Heavenly Bloodline, I still have other tricks up my sleeve,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br></p></div>
