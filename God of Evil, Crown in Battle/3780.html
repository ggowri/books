        <div> - Could He Save Me?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng arrived at the Void Cleanse Monastery, and discovered that Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s daughter Song Ge was not in the monastery.<br>It turned out that the people from the Void Cleanse Monastery had left for an Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant.<br>That remnant was not far from the monastery.<br>Thus, Chu Feng decided to proceed there.<br>Sure enough, Chu Feng not only found the people from the Void Cleanse Monastery, but he also found Song Ge.<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant was located deep underground. It was very complicated, like a maze. Furthermore, it posed a certain amount of danger.<br>The people from the Void Cleanse Monastery had decided to split off to examine the monastery. Because of that, Song Ge ended up entering a hidden tunnel by herself.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng decided to secretly follow her. He did not reveal himself to directly converse with her.<br>The reason for that was because a thought had come to Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind.<br>He felt that it was very possible that Song Ge would encounter danger. If he were to save her when she encountered danger, she would definitely feel grateful toward him.<br>With that, Song Ge would lower her guard against him. In turn, which would make it easier to communicate with her.<br>It would not be too late for him to think of a way to bring up the matter regarding Old Freak Tang after growing familiar with Song Ge.<br>Although Chu Feng&rsquo;s scheme might be a bit despicable, he had no other alternative. After all, Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s curse techniques were simply too important for him.<br>Besides, Old Freak Tang would not be able to live for much longer.<br>If Chu Feng ended up missing this opportunity, he might never be able to learn the way to remove curses.<br>However, Chu Feng had underestimated Song Ge. While it was true that she encountered many hurdles on her way, she managed to breach all of them without needing his assistance.<br>After surmounting all the difficulties in her path, she finally arrived before a palace hall.<br>After entering the palace hall, one would notice that there were many entrances to the palace hall.<br>The path Song Ge took was merely one of the many entrances. However&hellip; that was not what was important.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something inside the palace hall.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was able to determine with a single glance that there was something inside the palace hall. He was also able to tell what that something was.<br>It was a secret skill, a conscious and masterless secret skill.<br>Although the secret skill was not a high-level one, it would still be rather difficult to handle for Song Ge.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, a roar sounded in the palace hall not long after Song Ge entered it.<br>Then, the palace hall started to tremble violently. Jade-green gaseous flames began to flow out from all around the palace hall. In the end, they gathered together and formed a giant beast over three hundred meters tall.<br>The giant beast floated in midair, and appeared very majestic. It seemed like a ruler overlooking mortals.<br>Seeing that giant beast, Song Ge stepped back repeatedly in fear.<br>&ldquo;This Exalted One is the secret skill, Jade Heavenly Beast.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am here awaiting a fated individual.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if you wish to obtain this Exalted One&rsquo;s power, you will first have to prove yourself,&rdquo; the secret skill said to Song Ge.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what must this junior do in order to obtain your power?&rdquo; Song Ge asked very courteously.<br>&ldquo;Another one came?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed. He discovered&hellip; another aura emerging from another entrance. Furthermore, that person was rapidly approaching.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected that someone actually arrived sooner than me.&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, a man soon entered from another hidden path.<br>That man was about the same age as Song Ge. Even his cultivation was the same as hers; he was also a rank one Heavenly Immortal.<br>Furthermore, that man was very handsome. However, judging from his outfit, he was not someone from the Void Cleanse Monastery.<br>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;<br>Song Ge did not know who that man was and she immediately raised her guard.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, there&rsquo;s no need to be so tense. Although I&rsquo;ve also come for the secret skill, since young lady has arrived before me, the secret skill will naturally belong to you.&rdquo; The man revealed a brilliant smile.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really planning to me have it?&rdquo;<br>Evidently, Song Ge did not expect the man to be willing to yield the secret skill to her.<br>&ldquo;Of course. I, Ma Liang, never lie.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Especially towards a beautiful young lady like yourself,&rdquo; said that man who proclaimed himself to be Ma Liang.<br>Hearing those words, Song Ge&rsquo;s face reddened slightly. However, she didn&rsquo;t say anything in response.<br>&ldquo;Brat, what did you take this Exalted One to be? Did you think that anyone could receive this Exalted One&rsquo;s power?&rdquo;<br>Song Ge and Ma Liang&rsquo;s conversation ended up angering the secret skill.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Ma Liang waved his arm, and a body of light rushed towards the secret skill.<br>&ldquo;Clash~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>As that body of light struck the giant beast, it immediately let out a pained roar.<br>At the same time, the giant beast of a secret skill started to emit white steam.<br>That was a spirit formation, a spirit formation capable of restraining the power of the giant secret skill beast.<br>&ldquo;Bastard! I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;<br>Struck by the spirit formation, the giant secret skill giant beast was completely enraged by Ma Liang. However, its power had been greatly weakened by the spirit formation. Even its body became very illusory.<br>It no longer possessed the imposing air it had emitted when it first appeared.<br>&ldquo;Clank, clank, clank~~~&rdquo;<br>Being prepared, Ma Liang took out his weapon and rushed towards the secret skill, colliding with it.<br>Already furious, the secret skill would naturally not hold back against him.<br>However, Ma Liang was not one to be reckoned with either. He possessed some ability as well.<br>As the two of them fought, they actually ended up in a stalemate.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, please assist me. After subduing this secret skill, it shall be yours.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that he was unable to defeat the secret skill on his own, Ma Liang turned to ask for Song Ge&rsquo;s assistance.<br>Hearing Ma Liang, Song Ge immediately took out her weapon and rushed towards the giant secret skill beast.<br>With their joint efforts, the secret skill was immediately put in a disadvantaged state. Even though it was still resisting tenaciously, Chu Feng knew that the secret skill had already lost, and would sooner or later be subdued by the two of them.<br>Seeing that scene, Chu Feng couldn't keep himself from remembering his time in the Nine Provinces Continent.<br>Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from remember that year...<br>That year, he was still a disciple of the Azure Dragon Sect.<br>Inside a remnant, he had encountered the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique and Zi Ling.<br>At that time, Chu Feng and Zi Ling were strangers. For the sake of obtaining the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique, Chu Feng had started fighting Zi Ling.<br>It could be said that he had made an enemy out of Zi Ling at that time.<br>However, who would&rsquo;ve thought that Zi Ling would end up becoming his fiance, his lover?<br>Recalling his own experience and seeing Song Ge and Ma Liang, Chu Feng felt that they were a rather ideal couple.<br>He felt that two more people would end up together because of a secret skill.<br>At the very least, that Ma Liang was much more magnanimous than he was back then. After all, Ma Liang was planning to give the secret skill to Song Ge.<br>&ldquo;Rooarr~~~&rdquo;<br>A scream was heard. The giant beast secret skill was defeated by Ma Liang and Song Ge.<br>At the same time, Ma Liang used a treasure to subdue the secret skill.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, this is yours.&rdquo;<br>Ma Liang handed the subdued secret skill to Song Ge.<br>&ldquo;Young master, are you really giving that to me?&rdquo;<br>Although Song Ge wanted the secret skill a lot, she still felt very apologetic.<br>&ldquo;First come first served. Young lady, there&rsquo;s no need to be so courteous," Ma Liang said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;In that case, thank you young master.&rdquo;<br>Although Song Ge felt apologetic, she truly wanted the secret skill too much. Thus, she accepted the secret skill.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>However, to her surprise, Ma Liang suddenly attacked her with a palm strike to her dantian the instant she accepted the secret skill from him.<br>Caught completely off-guard, Song Ge was struck wholly by the palm strike.<br>She was sent flying several meters before smashing ruthlessly into a wall.<br>When she fell, blood was flowing from the corners of her mouth, and her aura had become extremely weak. She had practically lost the ability to continue fighting.<br>That said, compared to her pained expression, Song Ge&rsquo;s eyes were filled with innocence.<br>&ldquo;Young master, why did you do that?&rdquo; Song Ge asked in confusion.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. Young lady, are you really unable to tell?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;From the very start, I never planned to give this to you.&rdquo;<br>As Ma Liang spoke, he picked up the secret skill and directly assimilated it with himself.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; you&rsquo;re shameless and despicable!&rdquo;<br>Song Ge&rsquo;s face turned deathly pale with anger. In too much rage, her mouth opened, and she ended up spraying out a mouthful of blood. At that moment, Song Ge became even weaker.<br>&ldquo;Void Cleanse Monastery. I never would&rsquo;ve imagined the Void Cleanse Monastery would possess such a beauty like yourself.&rdquo;<br>Ma Liang looked to the weak Song Ge. A cold smile appeared on his face.<br>As he spoke, he actually began to take off his clothes.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; what are you planning to do?!&rdquo;<br>Seeing Ma Liang taking off his clothes and walking towards her, the anger on Song Ge&rsquo;s face was immediately replaced by endless fear.<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you call me despicable and shameless? Naturally, I&rsquo;ll have to act despicable and shameless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you will definitely die here today, why don&rsquo;t you let your daddy I enjoy himself before your death? Your daddy will also allow you to have a taste of what a man is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Speaking of it, your daddy has yet to toy with a female elder of the Void Cleanse Monastery.&rdquo;<br>Ma Liang acted extremely wickedly.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Song Ge was completely stunned after hearing those words.<br>Soon, a look of determination appeared in her eyes.<br>Song Ge raised her hand and gathered all of her martial power into her hand.<br>However, the palm strike that she gathered all of her power for was not aimed at Ma Liang.<br>She knew that she would not be able to fight Ma Liang, being seriously injured.<br>Thus, her palm was meant for herself.<br>She was planning to commit suicide!!!<br>Even if it meant death, she was unwilling to allow herself to be stained by Ma Liang.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>To Song Ge&rsquo;s surprise, right after she raised her hand, before she could attack herself, a powerful hand grabbed her wrist.<br>Not only that, but all of her gathered martial power instantly dispersed.<br>This situation caused Song Ge to nearly collapse with despair.<br>She was unable to escape and unable to kill herself. What could she possibly do in such a situation?<br>Must she resign herself to fate and allow herself to be tarnished by Ma Liang before death?<br>&ldquo;Who are you?!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, an embarrassed yet angry shout was heard.<br>That shout jolted Song Ge awake. She discovered that the shameless and despicable Ma Liang still hadn&rsquo;t reached her yet.<br>It turned out that it was another person that had grabbed her wrist.<br>That person looked very ordinary. His looks were nowhere near comparable to the handsome Ma Liang.<br>However, the appearance of that ordinary-looking individual gave Song Ge a ray of hope.<br>At the very least, that person did not appear to be Ma Liang&rsquo;s accomplice.<br>Perhaps that person would save her.<br>That said, at the same time as this thought came to Song Ge&rsquo;s mind, another thought also came into her mind.<br>She wondered&hellip; &lsquo;Will this person really be able to save me?&rsquo;<br></p></div>
