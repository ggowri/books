        <h1>Chapter 3552</h1>
        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Methods<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Bastard! You utter disgrace!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that their own clansman had actually succumbed to Chu Feng&rsquo;s threat and ended up untying the ropes around the people of the Starfall Holy Land and Ghost Sect Hall in succession, the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen that were not tortured by Chu Feng all gnashed their teeth and angrily cursed out their fellow clansman.<br>They all felt that what that Blood-devouring Demon Clansman did was an act of betrayal toward their Blood-devouring Demon Clan. They felt that he had completely disgraced them.<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were shouting all sorts of malicious words towards their fellow clansman. They were acting as if they would dismember their fellow clansman that had reached terms with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You all best not stay there idly either. Speak, why did you all come here? Why were you trying to capture them?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen.<br>&ldquo;Humph, we're not people that lack moral backbone. You can kill or torture us at will. However, you can forget about getting half a word through our mouths,&rdquo; the Blood-devouring Demon Clansman who seemed to be the leader of the bunch spoke stubbornly.<br>&ldquo;Oh? In that case, I shall see exactly how much moral backbone you possess.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he waved his arm, and countless needle-shaped objects flew out of Chu Feng&rsquo;s sleeve. Then, they accurately pierced into the bodies of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen.<br>This time around, he was no longer targeting a single person. Instead, he decided to torture all of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen.<br>Once the flying needles penetrated their bodies, they immediately reached their souls, and began to emit a miserable pain that the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen felt difficult to endure. Immediately, they started screaming miserably.<br>If one did not know what was going on, one would think that they had arrived in hell, or a demonic practitioner was torturing the innocent.<br>However, the situation at hand was completely different from that.<br>These were clearly demonic practitioners that were being tortured instead.<br>Seeing this scene, many people felt their hair stand on end. Fear appeared in their eyes as they looked to Chu Feng.<br>Although the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were demonic practitioners, Chu Feng&rsquo;s method was simply cruel.<br>At that moment, the crowd were feeling slightly happy.<br>Fortunately, Chu Feng was their ally, and not their enemy.<br>If he was their enemy&hellip; he would simply be too terrifying of an enemy.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s useless. Our Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen will never betray our clan, even if we are to die.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No matter how much you threaten us, you won't be able to gain anything from us.&rdquo;<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Clansman who seemed to be the leader of the bunch spoke whilst gnashing his teeth in pain. His voice was trembling and very weak. It could be seen that he also found Chu Feng&rsquo;s torture very difficult to endure.<br>However, his tone was slightly provocative and mocking.<br>Furthermore, it seemed to be just as he said. The Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen seemed to all be quite stubborn.<br>They would all rather endure the torture, than answer Chu Feng&rsquo;s questions.<br>It could be seen that they were rather unyielding.<br>After all, compared to untying their prisoners, betraying their clan&rsquo;s secrets was much more serious.<br>That said, Chu Feng did not panic. Instead, with a smile on his face, he quietly observed the situation at hand.<br>Chu Feng was waiting. After all, being tortured was not merely physical pain, it was something that reached one&rsquo;s soul, and would break down one&rsquo;s mind.<br>Unless one&rsquo;s willpower was truly strong, it would simply be impossible for one to endure extended torture. Chu Feng was waiting for the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen to have a nervous breakdown.<br>At that time, all of their mental defenses would crumble.<br>Just like that, Chu Feng waited for an entire hour. It was only then that he spoke again.<br>&ldquo;Among all of you, only a single person will have the opportunity to live.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will spare the first person to speak your purpose in coming here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for all the others, you can all wait for death,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip; I&rsquo;ll speak, I&rsquo;ll speak.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak, I&rsquo;ll speak.&rdquo;<br>&hellip;&hellip;...<br>This time around, there were many people that answered at the same time.<br>In fact, one of the first people to speak was an Exalted-level expert.<br>Whilst it was true that they were unyielding and possessed integrity, when faced with a single opportunity, they still revealed their selfishness. That&hellip; was human nature!!!<br>Seeing that so many of them had reached terms, Chu Feng said to the person who seemed to be the leader of the bunch, &ldquo;It would appear that your Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen are not all as unyielding as you are.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bastards, all of you! You&rsquo;re utter trash, utter trash! A complete disgrace!!!!&rdquo; That Blood-devouring Demon Clansman shouted hysterically.<br>The crowd were all able to sense his killing intent. However, it was useless. After all, all of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were already bugs within Chu Feng&rsquo;s grasp. They did not even possess the ability to protect themselves. Thus, how could they possibly harm others?<br>Seeing that the leader of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen had been driven mad with anger, Chu Feng smiled in satisfaction. This was precisely the result that he wanted.<br>Thus, Chu Feng no longer bothered with him. Instead, he arrived before that rank one Exalted Blood-devouring Demon Clansman who was also the first to voice his desire to speak.<br>&ldquo;You were the first to declare that you would speak. Thus, this opportunity shall be yours. However, I&rsquo;ll give you a word of advice. You&rsquo;d best answer all my questions honestly. Otherwise&hellip; what awaits you will make you truly wish you were dead.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked at that Blood-devouring Demon Clansman with an ice-cold look. His expression made everyone realize that he was not joking around. Instead, that was truly something that he was capable of doing.<br>&ldquo;Of course, of course. I will definitely tell you everything. Please don&rsquo;t torture me anymore. I beg of you, I beg of you.&rdquo;<br>That Blood-devouring Demon Clansman was sobbing, trembling and even cowering from Chu Feng as he said those words. It could be seen that he was truly unable to endure the torture anymore.<br>Witnessing that scene, the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master and Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master looked to one another.<br>They did not say anything. However, an expression of admiration was present in their eyes.<br>They were at that moment, feeling deep admiration for Chu Feng.<br>When capable of doing so with sufficient strength, forcing the Blood-devouring Clansmen to speak was actually not difficult to accomplish for either the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master or the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>However, they were, after all, the leaders of their respective powers, and people that had trained for many years. With all the experience that they had, it was only natural that they would have some extraordinary means to force people to speak.<br>However, Chu Feng was only a person of the younger generation, and such a young one on top of that. Yet, he was able to easily crush the unyielding Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen. This came as a surprise to them.<br>At the very least, the methods that he had displayed did not seem to be something that someone of his age should possess.<br>As for Chu Feng, he began to question that Blood-devouring Demon Clansman.<br></p></div>
