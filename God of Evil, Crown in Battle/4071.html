        <h1>Chapter 4070</h1>
        <div> - Before The Purple Star Hall<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had no idea that Chu Feng was lying to him. He took his words to be true, did not seek help from anyone, and instead allowing Chu Feng to heal himself.<br>In fact, for the sake of not disturbing Chu Feng, he also left the palace with Chu Hanpeng.<br>That said, he still had a worried look across his face.<br>He was still extremely worried for Chu Feng.<br>Compared to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the worry on Chu Hanpeng&rsquo;s face was not only limited to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, perhaps we should wait a bit before proceeding for the Purple Star Hall?&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng said to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Wait? For what?&rdquo; asked the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;We should wait until Chu Feng&rsquo;s poison is removed before proceeding for the Purple Star Hall. Else&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief interrupted him before he could finish, &ldquo;Else, the Xuanming Family will definitely cause trouble for us. Without Chu Feng, we will not be able to handle them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng nodded.<br>&ldquo;The current Chu Heavenly Clan relies on Chu Feng too much.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, Chu Feng is only a child. How could he possibly shoulder such pressure?&rdquo; said the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Then, Lord Clan Chief, your intention is&hellip;?&rdquo; asked Chu Hanpeng.<br>&ldquo;We are to continue toward the Purple Star Hall.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I refuse to believe the Xuanming Family would dare to obstruct us before the Purple Star Hall.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Also, I refuse to believe that the organizer of this distinguished gathering, the Purple Star Hall, would allow the Xuanming Family to do as they please in their territory.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief added, &ldquo;Hanpeng, do not forget that we were originally not planning to bring Chu Feng to this grand occasion.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, we cannot depend on him completely. Besides, he is currently suffering from a serious poison. You&rsquo;ve also witnessed the intensity of that poison. Even if he is able to remove the poison, his health will definitely be very weak.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could we have the heart to put all the responsibility of our clan onto Chu Feng&rsquo;s weak body?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the behavior of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Chu Hanpeng had no choice but to agree, &ldquo;Lord Clan Chief is correct, we should rely on ourselves this time around.&rdquo;<br>Then, the Chu Heavenly Clan continued to proceed toward the Purple Star Hall.<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...<br>Purple Star Hall.<br>As an overlord, their territory was generally always sealed off. No one was allowed to approach them.<br>Unless one were to possess an invitation letter, not to mention intruding into their territory, just approaching their territory would cause one to be severely punished, and potentially lose one&rsquo;s life.<br>The Purple Star Hall was the publicly accepted forbidden area of the Purple Star Upper Realm.<br>However, on some special occasions, the entrance to the Purple Star Hall would be open to the public.<br>This was the case in recent days.<br>Although the Purple Star Hall did not have the qualifications to manage the Ten Abandoned Starfields, they had a duty to the Ten Abandoned Starfields.<br>Periodically, they would organize a grand occasion, a distinguished meeting, for the Ten Abandoned Starfields.<br>Furthermore, with them taking the lead, the Ten Abandoned Starfields would all behave obediently. No one would dare to disobey them.<br>In fact, none of the Ten Abandoned Starfields dared to not show up.<br>During the time when the grand occasion was in progress, the Purple Star Hall would open their protective formation and allow everyone to come and participate in the grand occasion.<br>That being said, the great majority of those people were nothing more than spectators.<br>Even though they received warm hospitality from the Purple Star Hall, only the overlords from the Ten Abandoned Starfields were able to participate in certain grand occasions and events.<br>That said, it remains that people love excitement.<br>Thus, whenever it came time for this distinguished meeting, practically all the major powers of the Purple Star Upper Realm would come to participate.<br>Currently, the appearance of a single power caught the attention of everyone present.<br>This power was different from other powers.<br>They were not only all wearing monotone red attire, but they were also all women.<br>This power was naturally the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>As the new overlord of the All-heaven Starfield, the Red-dress Holy Land had also received the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s invitation.<br>Furthermore, they kept to the appointment punctually.<br>&ldquo;This is the Red-dress Holy Land, the power that defeated the All-heaven Sect?&rdquo;<br>News traveled very fast. Many powers of the Purple Star Hall had already learned about the conflict between the Red-dress Holy Land and the All-heaven Sect.<br>Upon thinking of how the Red-dress Holy Land was a power that defeated the All-heaven Sect and were fully composed of women, the powers from the Purple Star Hall all felt a whole new level of respect for the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Subconsciously, they all believed the Red-dress Holy Land to be a strong power.<br>After all, the All-heaven Sect was ranked among the best within the Ten Abandoned Starfields&rsquo; overlords.<br>Since the Red-dress Holy Land was able to defeat them, it would naturally mean that they were even stronger.<br>&ldquo;Look! That&rsquo;s the Chu Heavenly Clan!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, someone looked afar.<br>Another group of people appeared, and were approaching majestically.<br>They were the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Chu Heavenly Clan, they actually really came.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although they&rsquo;re also a new overlord power, they&rsquo;re completely different compared to the Red-dress Holy Land.&rdquo;<br>There were actually well-informed people that recognized the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s different about them?&rdquo;<br>There were also people lacking in knowledge of recent events that did not know about the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;The difference is major. The Red-dress Holy Land obtained their overlord status by defeating the All-heaven Sect with their strength.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, the All-heaven Starfield will soon be renamed the Red-dress Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did that Chu Heavenly Clan not defeat the Wuming Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course not. The one that defeated the Wuming Clan is the Linghu Heavenly Clan. As for the one that defeated the Linghu Heavenly Clan, it is Ancestral Martial Dragon City.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Chu Heavenly Clan is nothing more than Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s puppet.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, while they&rsquo;re a puppet, they&rsquo;re extremely weak. Reportedly, the strongest among them is only a peak Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A power like them is nothing more than a nobody. How could they possibly be able to shoulder the responsibility of a starfield&rsquo;s overlord?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While the people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield will show outward respect toward them after taking into consideration their support from Ancestral Martial Dragon City, they're simply worth nothing after leaving the vicinity of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, the people that came to participate in this grand occasion are all the overlords of starfields. They are the strongest experts of their respective starfields. For them to come to participate in such a grand occasion, they&rsquo;re simply asking to be humiliated.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead of them, it should be Ancestral Martial Dragon City that came.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am truly unable to understand why they would come here.&rdquo;<br>Many people began to discuss the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Regardless of whether they were knowledgeable about the Chu Heavenly Clan or not, they all began to gesticulate at the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>Compared to the Red-dress Holy Land, the Chu Heavenly Clan was a much more interesting subject to discuss.<br>It was mainly because the Chu Heavenly Clan was too weak.<br>Most people possessed this sort of inferior nature. They did not dare to gesticulate at powers stronger than themselves because they felt that they did not possess the qualifications to point their fingers at those stronger than them.<br>However, when it came to powers weaker than them, it was completely different.<br>Facing people weaker than them, they would feel a sense of superiority. Their feeling of superiority gave them sufficient confidence to allow them to make comments at, point their fingers at and even insult them.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan just so happened to fit that mold completely.<br>Suddenly, a blue-gowned old man spoke from the crowd, &ldquo;The Chu Heavenly Clan is not as useless as you all imagine them to be.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
