        <h1>Chapter 3666</h1>
        <div> - Whole New Level Of Respect<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Oh no! If they&rsquo;re unable to enter, it would be useless even if they&rsquo;ve managed to approach the pagoda.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, the hearts of many people tensed up and nervousness filled their eyes.<br>There were many people that were so nervous that they clenched their fists tightly, and were dripping cold sweat.<br>The closer one got to the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda, the more concentrated the overwhelming attacks became. Thus, even though Yin Zhuanghong was able to evade the attacks, it was very strenuous.<br>If this were to continue, the crowd were truly afraid that she would make a mistake, and lead Chu Feng to death with her.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, surprisingly, right at that moment, Yin Zhuanghong and Chu Feng began to emit dazzling light.<br>To be exact, it was Chu Feng who was emitting a dazzling light. That light was coming from Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm. Furthermore, that light contained enormous power.<br>The power contained in the light was actually composed of lightning, wind blades and flames.<br>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, isn&rsquo;t Chu Feng holding the power of the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda in his hand?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the crowd came to a sudden realization.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Before the crowd could think much about it, Chu Feng shot forth his palm. The power containing lightning, wind blades and flames turned into a pillar of light that shot straight for the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>A loud sound was heard and an entrance was forcibly created in the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.<br>At the instant the entrance appeared, Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong flew into it.<br>After the two of them went inside, the wall that had been clearly shattered miraculously restored itself.<br>At the same time, the slaughtering formation that was attacking nonstop began to dissipate.<br>The Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda had returned to its previous look. Even the marks on the ground left by the vicious attacks had disappeared.<br>It was as if nothing had happened at all; as if the dangerous scene from before had not happened at all.<br>However, everyone present, including Lord Shoujian, had looks of shock on their faces. They were, at that moment, unable to calm themselves.<br>&ldquo;Lord Shoujian, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, Chu Feng seems to have used the power of the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda&rsquo;s slaughtering formation to breach the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda, no?&rdquo; Kong Tianhui and the others from the younger generation all looked towards Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s indeed the case,&rdquo; said Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;It really was the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda&rsquo;s power?! But&hellip; how did he do that?&rdquo;<br>The crowd grew even more astonished. Even the people from the All-heaven Starfield turned their eyes to Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a spirit formation. Young friend Chu Feng used a special formation to absorb the power of the slaughtering formation so that he could use it himself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, he began absorbing that power the moment he set foot into the grand slaughtering formation,&rdquo; said Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;In that case, it would mean that Chu Feng was not resting. Instead, he was gathering the power of the slaughtering formation for the sake of breaching the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda?&rdquo; asked Kong Ci.<br>&ldquo;That is indeed the case. Thus&hellip; one absolutely cannot look down on Saint-cloak World Spiritists. Although a Saint-cloak World Spiritist might be weaker than a martial cultivator in a battle of pure martial power, what a Saint-cloak World Spiritist can accomplish with their spirit power is far superior to what a martial cultivator can accomplish.&rdquo;<br>When Lord Shoujian said those words, he deliberately glanced at the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations that had insulted Chu Feng previously.<br>He was deliberately trying to make those All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations realize how ignorant they were.<br>At that moment, the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations had looks of embarrassment on their faces. After being glanced at in such a manner by Lord Shoujian, their embarrassment intensified.<br>The truth was before their faces. Even they knew that they had underestimated Chu Feng.<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong had entered the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.<br>Chu Feng was holding a stone in his hand.<br>Whilst his Saint-level spirit power had undoubtedly contributed greatly to him being able to absorb the grand slaughtering formation&rsquo;s power, the true reason why he was capable of that feat was that stone.<br>That stone appeared very unremarkable. However, it was capable of storing the power of the grand slaughtering formation.<br>As for that stone, it was something that Yin Zhuanghong had placed in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand when she was whispering into his ear.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng had discovered that Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s eyes were very extraordinary. She was most likely not a Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Yet, she was able to see through all of the grand slaughtering formation&rsquo;s attacks.<br>Seeing through the grand slaughtering formation&rsquo;s attacks was most definitely not something that could be done with a greater cultivation. Instead, one must possess special techniques.<br>As Chu Feng was a Saint-cloak World Spiritist and possessed the Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, he was naturally also able to see through the attacks from the grand slaughtering formation, and seek out a path of safety.<br>However, even if he was the one leading the way, he would, at the very most, only be able to do what Yin Zhuanghong had done. It would be impossible for him to avoid the attacks better than her.<br>However, Yin Zhuanghong was clearly not a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Thus, Chu Feng was certain that the reason why she was capable of such a feat was because of her eyes.<br>Even though he was unable to detect anything peculiar about her eyes, he was able to tell that her eyes were definitely different from ordinary people&rsquo;s eyes.<br>She had a pair of special eyes.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you possess quite a few secrets,&rdquo; Chu Feng returned the stone to Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Yin Zhuanghong received the stone from Chu Feng. Then, with a &lsquo;snap,&rsquo; she crushed it.<br>&ldquo;A senior of my clan had attempted to breach this place. Although she ultimately failed, she managed to determine its weakness. If one wishes to enter the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda, one can only do so with absolute power, or the power of the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, upon her return, she immediately began to gather materials and, after meticulous preparations for many years, created that stone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, after she finished making the stone, she died from exhaustion.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the stone, it can only be used once,&rdquo; said Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to destroy it, no? You could keep it as a keepsake,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That was my senior&rsquo;s final wish. She ordered the stone to be destroyed after it was used,&rdquo; after saying those words, Yin Zhuanghong scattered the dust from the crushed stone onto the ground.<br>&ldquo;Actually, compared to that stone, I am more curious about your eyes,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Yin Zhuanghong glared at Chu Feng upon hearing those words.<br>At that moment, the person standing before Chu Feng was no longer a marvelous celestial-fairy-like beauty.<br>Instead, it was a terrifying existence. She was not a monster, nor was she a demon. However, she was so terrifying that even Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart trembled with fear.<br>That said, that feeling only lasted for an instant.<br>When Chu Feng looked at Yin Zhuanghong again, he discovered that she had returned to being cold and indifferent. Her gaze had become very normal. He was unable to detect anything strange about her.<br>However, the overwhelming pressure he had felt earlier was firmly engraved into his heart.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng was certain that the enormous pressure had come from Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;Everyone has their own secrets. You also have secrets,&rdquo; Yin Zhuanghong said coldly.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng spread open his arms in a shrug.<br>What she'd said was indeed correct. Everyone had secrets. Chu Feng also had secrets. Furthermore, he would not allow his secrets to be known by others easily.<br>&ldquo;I was presumptuous,&rdquo; Chu Feng said apologetically.<br>Yin Zhuanghong did not bother with him. Instead, she turned her gaze look at their surroundings.<br>Chu Feng had actually inspected their surroundings already.<br>They were currently on the first floor of the Heaven-reaching Armory Pagoda.<br>There was not a single weapon on the first floor. To be exact, there was simply nothing on the first floor besides a single signboard erected in the center of the floor.<br>On the signboard were written some awe-inspiring words: &lsquo;One can only choose a single weapon from the pagoda!!!&rsquo;<br>It was simple and clear. It firmly told Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong that they were not allowed to take more than a single weapon.<br></p></div>
