        <h1>Chapter 4098</h1>
        <div> - The Arrival Of The Hall Master<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng turned his gaze to Li Mengyue.<br>Seeing his confused look, Li Mengyue didn&rsquo;t hesitate, and informed Chu Feng of what had happened.<br>Not long after the tribulation lightning entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, he started screaming miserably in pain.<br>At the same time, countless bolts of lightning were released from his body. Furthermore, he was emitting a light similar to that of the cultivation treasure.<br>Both the lightning and the light contained terrifying power. Because of that, Li Mengyue and others were unable to approach him at all.<br>However, the lightning and light soon disappeared.<br>Chu Feng also stopped screaming in pain.<br>Yet, a change then occurred to the Purple Star Variance Realm.<br>The sky started to shatter. The Purple Star Variance Beasts started dying. To be exact, all the creatures and plants, all living things in this world, were rapidly dying.<br>Even the Purple Star Variance Realm was on the verge of collapse, and could crumble at any moment.<br>Li Mengyue and others were uncertain as to why such a change had occurred.<br>But, they felt that this change was most likely related to Chu Feng.<br>After all, this change only occurred after he had stopped screaming in pain.<br>After learning of what had happened, Chu Feng knew why the Purple Star Variance Realm was collapsing.<br>The foundation of the Purple Star Variance Realm should be that cultivation treasure.<br>Since that cultivation treasure had been destroyed, this world would naturally cease to exist.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, how could you not know why the Purple Star Variance Realm has become like this?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You must&rsquo;ve obtained that cultivation treasure, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve obtained the cultivation treasure, there is no longer any reason for this Purple Star Variance Realm to continue to exist.&rdquo;<br>An extremely weak voice sounded. It was the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Supreme Elder, Pang Youyang.<br>This Pang Youyang had ignored Chu Feng&rsquo;s warning earlier and stubbornly challenged the lightning tribulation.<br>Not only did he trigger the tribulation, but he was also struck by lightning and ended up seriously injured.<br>Even though his injuries had stabilized somewhat, he was still seriously injured and hurt.<br>That said, Chu Feng could tell from the tone of his voice that he was not concerned with his condition at all.<br>What he was concerned with was that cultivation treasure, and whether or not Chu Feng had obtained it.<br>&ldquo;There was no cultivation treasure at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That so-called cultivation treasure was nothing more than a scam.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only dangers in this place and no treasure. We are all enormously fortunate to be able to survive,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no cultivation treasure, you say?&rdquo;<br>The crowd&rsquo;s expressions turned complicated after hearing Chu Feng.<br>They were somewhat skeptical. Yet, they were slightly convinced too.<br>After all, it was all thanks to Chu Feng that they were able to survive.<br>In terms of their understanding of the Purple Star Variance Realm, likely not even the people from the Purple Star Hall would have a better understanding than Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>A cold laugh sounded. It was Pang Youyang.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, if you&rsquo;ve obtained it, then you&rsquo;ve obtained it. Why bother to not admit to it?&rdquo; Pang Youyang said with an eccentric tone.<br>Hearing that, Chu Feng displayed his displeasure. &ldquo;I, Chu Feng, am always one to say one thing and do precisely that. That so-called cultivation treasure is indeed a dangerous object. Earlier, it tried to take my life. Apart from that, it did not present me with any benefit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I had truly obtained it, I would definitely admit to it openly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I dare to admit to it? If I obtained it, it would be mine. Should I be afraid of it being snatched away from me by someone?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was your Purple Star Hall that declared the cultivation treasure to be the possession of whoever obtained it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Pang Youyang.<br>Pang Youyang was left speechless. However, he still continued to smile coldly.<br>That smile not only brought displeasure to Chu Feng, but it also brought displeasure to the others present.<br>Everything Chu Feng had said was reasonable.<br>It was precisely the Purple Star Hall who had declared that the cultivation treasure would belong to whoever obtained it. All of them could bear witness to it.<br>Yet now, as a Purple Star Hall Supreme Elder, Pang Youyang said those words eccentrically. It was clear that he was thinking about that cultivation treasure.<br>Since that was the case, it would mean that the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s declaration of the cultivation treasure belonging to whoever obtained it was pure bullshit. They were deceiving them and exploiting them. It would only be natural for them to feel displeased.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, ear-piercing rumbles sounded nonstop from all directions.<br>At the same time, countless fragments fell from the sky. The Purple Star Variance Realm was on the verge of total collapse.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, how are we to leave this place?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the situation turned bad, the crowd&rsquo;s gazes all turned to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng was their savior now. Only he could bring them out of here.<br>&ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng did not disappoint the crowd. He waved his sleeve, and a layer of spirit power enveloped everyone.<br>Then, the crowd&rsquo;s surroundings started to sway.<br>When things stabilized, they had left the Purple Star Variance Realm.<br>&ldquo;Clamor~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, cheers sounded from all directions.<br>Those cheering voices were deafeningly loud. Their sudden arrival shocked everyone.<br>Turning toward the source, the crowd discovered that even though they&rsquo;d left the Purple Star Variance Realm, the place they&rsquo;d arrived at was not the entrance to the Purple Star Variance Realm.<br>Instead, they&rsquo;d arrived outside the Purple Star Hall.<br>People from everywhere were gathered here.<br>Even though the Purple Star Variance Realm had collapsed, the abnormal sign in the sky was still there.<br>The abnormal sign in the sky had shown the people outside everything that had happened in the Purple Star Variance Realm.<br>Because of that, the people outside had all witnessed everything that had occurred within the Purple Star Variance Realm.<br>Because of that, all the cheers right now were meant for Chu Feng.<br>All the praises and exclamations were also meant for him.<br>After all, it was he who had dictated everything in the Purple Star Variance Realm.<br>He was even the one who had saved everyone in the end.<br>Seeing the treatment Chu Feng was receiving, the Xuanming Family, Miao Heavenly Clan and the other powers all revealed complicated expressions.<br>In the past, the Ancestral Martial Starfield had always been the weakest among their Ten Abandoned Starfields.<br>When they learned of the Chu Heavenly Clan becoming the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s overlord, they had all felt that the Ancestral Martial Starfield was beyond help, and would grow weaker and weaker.<br>And, as they had expected, the Chu Heavenly Clan was pathetically weak. They were far inferior to their predecessor, the Wuming Clan, to the point where they could not even be discussed alongside them.<br>What they had never imagined was that the Chu Heavenly Clan actually possessed such an exceptional member of the younger generation.<br>At such a young age, he was already a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>His battle power was also so powerful that it was heaven-defying.<br>By relying on his world spirit techniques, he had defeated the strongest expert of the Ten Abandoned Starfields, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>However, none of those were that terrifying.<br>Most terrifying of all would be the lightning tribulation in the Purple Star Variance Realm. Not even the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Supreme Elder Pang Youyang was able to take a single lightning strike.<br>Yet, Chu Feng managed to forcibly take on the entire tribulation, and come out unscathed.<br>He had rescued all of them.<br>Seeing how Chu Feng was receiving praises and acknowledgement from powers all over the Purple Star Hall, even they felt that Chu Feng was worthy of them.<br>Suddenly, a voice was heard. &ldquo;Amazing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truly never would I have expected for the Chu Heavenly Clan of the desolate Ancestral Martial Starfield to actually produce such an exceptional member of the younger generation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the Ancestral Martial Starfield, that already forgotten starfield, will be remembered again sooner or later by the people of the Holy Light Galaxy because of you.&rdquo;<br>Once that voice sounded, the crowd immediately shut their mouths.<br>This place where countless people were gathered suddenly turned quiet. It was somewhat strange.<br>The reason for this was because the person who had come was the fully-deserving number one expert of this place, the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>He praised Chu Feng the moment he appeared.<br>However, Chu Feng narrowed his brows at the sight of him.<br>Chu Feng was not the only one. The others also cried out &lsquo;oh no&rsquo; in their hearts.<br>The reason for that was because there was a group of people behind the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>Those were the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>Even the still-injured Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was being carried over here.<br>This made everyone realize that the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had come with ill intentions.<br></p></div>
