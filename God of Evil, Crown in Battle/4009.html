        <div> - Zhao Hong&rsquo;s Defeat<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Facing the Mystic Cave Saints acting in such a manner, Chu Feng found himself at a loss as to what to do.<br>Out of desperation, he turned his gaze to the spirit formation gate again.<br>He wanted to see how much longer it could last.<br>However, upon doing so, he discovered that Zhao Hong&rsquo;s silhouette had reappeared in the spirit formation gate.<br>However, her current condition was not optimistic at all.<br>Zhao Hong&hellip; had lost an arm.<br>Furthermore, from her pained expression, Chu Feng knew that she was suffering from more than mere physical injuries.<br>Her soul had been seriously injured.<br>Looking towards the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, one could see that he was completely unharmed.<br>The battle between them was truly world-shaking. From this, one could tell that they were not holding anything back.<br>Because of that, Zhao Hong&rsquo;s injuries signified one thing.<br>Even though both of them were rank four Utmost Exalted, Zhao Hong was no match for the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m truly sorry. There&rsquo;s no alternative, please excuse my offense,&rdquo; as Chu Feng spoke, the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak appeared on his body.<br>Chu Feng released his spirit power and instantly engulfed the Mystic Cave Saints with it.<br>All of the Mystic Cave Saints were restricted by his spirit power, and were unable to move.<br>Then, Chu Feng forcibly pulled out the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; Eldest&rsquo;s hand and took the little golden person.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, wait,&rdquo; the Eldest said hurriedly. He knew that Chu Feng was planning to go.<br>&ldquo;Since you insist on going, allow us to accompany you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You will definitely not be able to withstand its backlash should you use it alone. You will definitely die once the backlash arrives.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We can help you. We brothers can help you withstand its power, and then transfer everything back to your body.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With that, even when the backlash comes, we brothers will be able to take it on together.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No matter how strong the backlash might be, you should be able to survive it.&rdquo;<br>After hearing the words spoken by the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints, Chu Feng felt a warmth in his heart.<br>But he didn&rsquo;t stop. Instead, he said to the Eldest, &ldquo;My restrictive formation is linked to this spirit formation gate. Once the gate disappears, my restrictive formation will also disappear on its own.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng grasped the little golden person and stepped into the spirit formation gate.<br>Chu Feng had refused the kind intentions of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>It was his own decision to rescue Zhao Hong. This was something that was unrelated to the Mystic Cave Saints to begin with.<br>As such, he did not wish for the Mystic Cave Saints to endure the risk; the potentially fatal danger, with him.<br>&hellip;...<br>&ldquo;Zhao Hong, is this all you&rsquo;re capable of?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The you from back then wasn&rsquo;t this weak.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that although you&rsquo;ve been reborn, your talent did not increase, but has instead decreased.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And here I thought you&rsquo;d become extremely powerful, seeing that you dared to find me for revenge. You also saw how I was truly terrified by you earlier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that you were actually this weak. You&rsquo;ve thoroughly disappointed me.&rdquo;<br>The All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster looked at Zhao Hong with a mocking expression.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, golden light shone brightly. Zhao Hong had attacked again.<br>The All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster rushed forth to take her on without any hesitation.<br>Their confrontation this time around lasted merely an instant.<br>When they reappeared in the crowd&rsquo;s eyes, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster&rsquo;s All-heaven Dragon Sword had pierced into Zhao Hong&rsquo;s body.<br>That All-heaven Dragon Sword was also emitting lightning that entered Zhao Hong&rsquo;s body with the sword, covering her completely.<br>Zhao Hong seemed to have lost the strength to continue fighting as a look of pain covered her face.<br>She was still enduring it. Even though everyone could tell from her facial expression that she was in immense pain, she did not let out a single groan of pain.<br>She was gritting her teeth tightly and enduring the pain that engulfed her body.<br>&ldquo;Zhao Hong, taking our previous affection into consideration, as long as you hand over the Reincarnation Pearl, I can leave your corpse intact,&rdquo; said the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>Even at that moment, he was still deeply interested in the Reincarnation Pearl.<br>&ldquo;In your dreams.&rdquo;<br>A look of determination appeared in Zhao Hong&rsquo;s eyes. She was unwilling to compromise even if the alternative was death.<br>&ldquo;Your temper remains the same. You&rsquo;re still fond of drinking a forfeit instead of a toast,&rdquo; the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster said with a cold smile.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The intensity of the lightning unleashed by the All-heaven Dragon Sword increased several-fold.<br>Like sharp blades, the lightning shuttled through Zhao Hong&rsquo;s body repeatedly.<br>In the blink of an eye, Zhao Hong was left completely mutilated and her body completely tattered.<br>Her miserable appearance caused many female members of the younger generation to turn away in terror.<br>Not only was Zhao Hong&rsquo;s body completely covered in wounds, but she had also grown abnormally weak. She was unable to even hold onto her Reincarnation Rune Sword.<br>However, when the Reincarnation Rune Sword fell from the sky, a hand suddenly appeared and grabbed it.<br>Then, that person held the Reincarnation Rune Sword and rushed towards the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>It turned out that it was the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster, Han Xiu.<br>&ldquo;Liu Shuo, prepare to die!&rdquo;<br>Anger filled Han Xiu&rsquo;s face and killing intent filled her eyes.<br>Even her body had undergone a special sort of transformation.<br>She had used an extremely powerful ability.<br>Han Xiu had unleashed all her strength with the intention of killing the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before Han Xiu could even approach the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, she let out a scream.<br>It was an oppressive might!<br>Without even moving, and merely by releasing his oppressive might, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had managed to restrict Han Xiu&rsquo;s movement.<br>Not only that, but his oppressive might turned into an invisible hand that forcibly tore apart Han Xiu&rsquo;s dantian.<br>In unbearable pain, Han Xiu screamed miserably.<br>&ldquo;Xiu&rsquo;er!&rdquo;<br>Zhao Hong&rsquo;s expression changed enormously upon witnessing such a scene, worry immediately filled her eyes.<br>&ldquo;My, it would appear that the master and servant have quite a deep relationship.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, you&rsquo;ll really have to hand over the Reincarnation Pearl.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, she&rsquo;ll not only be simply losing her cultivation,&rdquo; said the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Release her. As long as you release her, I will tell you the Reincarnation Pearl&rsquo;s whereabouts,&rdquo; said Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to deceive me again?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in no position to haggle with me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hand over the Reincarnation Pearl right now or else&hellip; I will take her life.&rdquo;<br>As the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster spoke, he made a grabbing motion towards the void, and a martial power spear appeared in his hand.<br>He was threatening Zhao Hong.<br>He planned to kill Han Xiu unless Zhao Hong handed the Reincarnation Pearl over right away.<br>&ldquo;Release her first. If you release her, I will definitely give you the Reincarnation Pearl,&rdquo; said Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you still don't understand your current situation.&rdquo;<br>With a smile on his face, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, he waved his hand, and the spear he held shot straight towards Han Xiu.<br>That spear was extremely powerful. Everywhere it passed, space crumbled.<br>Everyone could tell that the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had not been holding back with his attack at all.<br>He fully intended to kill Han Xiu.<br>Actually, the instant she saw the martial power spear, Han Xiu knew that her soul would shatter and she would definitely be killed should the spear reach her.<br>As such, she closed her eyes the moment she saw the spear being thrown towards her.<br>She had made her 'preparations' for death.<br>Ever since she had decided to accompany Zhao Hong, she had known the consequences of failure.<br>As such, there was no trace of fear on her face. Instead, she had a relieved expression.<br>It was as if she were going to return to her final resting place.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a violent gale swept forth, causing her clothes to flutter violently. The wind was too strong, so strong that she felt a stinging pain on her face.<br>However, her anticipated death did not come.<br>Furthermore, to Han Xiu&rsquo;s greatest surprise, she was able to hear voices of astonishment sounding from the crowd all around.<br>It seemed like another enormous change had occurred!<br></p></div>
