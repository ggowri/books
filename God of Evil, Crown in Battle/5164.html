        <h1>Chapter 5163</h1>
        <div>: Mysterious Life<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yu Sha had seen the feverish eyes that Chu Feng looked at Eggy with. That was a look that he didn&rsquo;t show even to Zi Ling. That showed just how special Eggy was to him.<br>That was why she expected Chu Feng to supply her with only a small portion of origin energies and reserve the bulk of it for Eggy. She wouldn&rsquo;t blame Chu Feng for it since she had already chosen to pledge loyalty to him. That was the life she had chosen.<br>Yet, Chu Feng was offering so many origin energies to her. How could she possibly not feel excited?<br>&ldquo;Yu Sha, how far do you think you&rsquo;ll be able to advance your cultivation with these origin energies?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Yu Sha was a formidable world spirit in her own rights too, though she paled in comparison to Eggy. Back then, when Chu Feng was weaker, he relied on her to deal with Linghu Hongfei.<br>If Yu Sha was able to significantly advance her cultivation, she would definitely be of great help to him.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, but I should be able to catch up with you at the very least. The origin energies belong to God-cloak World Spiritists, after all. That&rsquo;s much more nourishing to us than the origin energies of pure cultivators,&rdquo; Yu Sha replied.<br>&ldquo;Alright. You should consume them then,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;These origin energies are too powerful, unlike those from before. To bring out their full potency, I&rsquo;ll need some time to cultivate,&rdquo; Yu Sha replied.<br>&ldquo;I understand. You should focus on your cultivation and try to maximize your gains if possible,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;<br>With a nod, Yu Sha prepared to dive into cultivation. However, she was soon reminded of something, and she turned to look at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what are you planning to do next?&rdquo; Yu Sha asked.<br>&ldquo;The person whom I want to kill the most right now is Situ Tingye. He dared to torture Elder Yuwei; I&rsquo;ll return the favor to him. I&rsquo;ll make him kneel in front of me and ElderYuwei and have him beg us to kill him.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes suddenly turned vicious.<br>&ldquo;Of course, I won&rsquo;t recklessly barge into the Situ World Spiritist Clan, especially now that I don&rsquo;t have the Asura World Spirit Army with me. I&rsquo;ll first focus on acquiring Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s legacy. Lord Zhenlong was able to become the most respected world spiritist of the Totem Dragon Clan through the legacy, so it should be of great help to me too,&rdquo; Chu Feng added.<br>&ldquo;You must be careful, Chu Feng,&rdquo; Yu Sha said out of worry.<br>Chu Feng felt a tinge of warmth in his heart. He could still remember how much Yu Sha scorned him the first time they met. In fact, when she realized that Xue Ji was no longer around, she immediately made up her mind to return to the Asura Spirit World, adamantly refusing to serve him.<br>She only stayed in the end because she realized that it was impossible for her to return.<br>However, her attitude had completely changed now. He had become one of the people whom she sincerely cared for.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll be fine. Didn&rsquo;t you say that you&rsquo;ll be able to catch up with me earlier? You&rsquo;ll have to work hard for that. I won&rsquo;t just be idling around for you to catch up with me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>Yu Sha revealed a rare smile.<br>She wasn&rsquo;t the type who would often smile, but that made her occasional smiles look even more moving.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s both work hard together.&rdquo;<br>Yu Sha sat down with crossed legs and began cultivating with the origin energies.<br>As soon as her attention was on her cultivation, Chu Feng&rsquo;s smile immediately vanished. He had been forcing on a smile in order to reassure Yu Sha, but the situation wasn&rsquo;t good at all. He was no stranger to adversity, but Song Yuwei was in a terrible state.<br>While he had successfully retained her cultivation, her soul was so injured that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t sure when she could awake from her coma. On top of that, he couldn&rsquo;t tell whether there would be any lingering side effects afterward.<br>Most important of all, he was not out of danger yet. The Situ World Spiritist Clan already had their eyes set on City Lord Liang and the ancient city, so he couldn&rsquo;t afford to stay here for long. Thus, he quickly returned his consciousness back to his body.<br>&ldquo;City Lord Liang, Situ Tingye should be aware of your ties with Elder Yuwei. Even if he doesn&rsquo;t know your exact relationship, the chances are slim that he&rsquo;ll let you off. We should quickly leave this place,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;My thoughts exactly, young master Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>City Lord Liang had already made preparations. He quickly gathered his clan members and left the area together with Chu Feng.<br>Before leaving, Chu Feng made sure to transfer all of the civilians in the ancient city out and did some<br>special processing<br>on the corpses of the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen.<br>&hellip;<br>Upon leaving the ancient city, the group swiftly flitted across the air. They traveled for a long distance, only stopping when they arrived at a location City Lord Liang deemed to be safe.<br>The first thing Chu Feng did was to check on Song Yuwei. The formation was operating as intended, but her condition wasn&rsquo;t alleviating in the least.<br>Ultimately, Chu Feng was only at rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation. Even if he was able to boost his spirit power using the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk, there was only so much stronger his formations could get.<br>He had managed to stabilize Song Yuwei&rsquo;s condition for the time being, but if he couldn&rsquo;t properly treat her fast, it was only a matter of time before her condition deteriorated.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, Lord Yuwei is in a severe condition. She won&rsquo;t last long at this rate. I have a friend who is a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist specializing in medical treatment. If you&rsquo;re willing to trust me, I can bring Lord Yuwei over for treatment,&rdquo; City Lord Liang said.<br>He sharply noticed that Chu Feng was helpless before Song Yuwei&rsquo;s condition despite the tremendous power he wielded. At this rate, Song Yuwei would be in grave danger.<br>&ldquo;I trust you, City Lord Liang. I&rsquo;m just not sure whether your friend is willing to treat Elder Yuwei or not,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>Song Yuwei was not in a good position either. Her carelessness had exposed her to the Situ World Spiritist Clan, and it was only a matter of time before they placed her on a wanted list. No one would want to risk crossing the Situ World Spiritist Clan to help her.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, to be honest with you, my friend has also received help from Lord Luoyi. If he learns that Lord Yuwei is severely injured, he&rsquo;ll most definitely rush here right away. It&rsquo;s just that I have no way of contacting him, though I do know where he lives,&rdquo; City Lord Liang replied.<br>&ldquo;Is it convenient for you, City Lord Liang?&rdquo; Chu Feng glanced at the ten thousand clan members standing behind City Lord Liang as he asked.<br>City Lord Liang was no longer alone. He had over ten thousand clan members relying on him for survival.<br>&ldquo;You need not worry about my clan members. I have long made plans to retire in seclusion, and I have already prepared a place. I&rsquo;ll have my clan members head there first, and I&rsquo;ll meet up with them at a later date,&rdquo; City Lord Liang replied.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be counting on you then, City Lord Liang,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>Deeply worried about Song Yuwei&rsquo;s condition, he wouldn&rsquo;t pass on an opportunity to have her treated.<br>The group soon split into two.<br>City Lord Liang&rsquo;s clan members headed over to a secluded hiding place whereas City Lord Liang himself brought Chu Feng to the White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist who might be able to treat Song Yuwei.<br>City Lord Liang&rsquo;s friend was residing in another realm, so they had to pass through a teleportation formation. While City Lord Liang was setting up their destination in the teleportation formation, Chu Feng asked, &ldquo;City Lord Liang, is that where your friend lives?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Don&rsquo;t worry, young master Chu Feng. That starfield happens to be located right next to ours, so it won&rsquo;t take too long for us to get there,&rdquo; City Lord Liang replied.<br>It was not out of concern for the distance that Chu Feng asked that question. Rather, he was mystified by the machinations of fate. It just so happened that the realm City Lord Liang&rsquo;s friend was residing in was the Bittershore Starfield&rsquo;s Bittersea Lower Realm.<br>It was the same realm where Lord Zhenlong received his legacy, as well as the place Chu Feng was planning to head to.<br></p></div>
