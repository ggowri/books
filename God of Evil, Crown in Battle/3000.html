        <div> - Bloodcurse Demonic Technique<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>"Chu Feng, mark my words. Today, no matter what, you will definitely die here."<br>When Chu Zhiyuan said those words to Chu Feng, confidence filled his face.<br>"If that's the case, I am truly impatient to see what sort of ability you might have," Chu Feng said.<br>"As you wish," After Chu Zhiyuan said those words, the weather immediately changed as lightning galloped forth. Chu Zhiyuan had unleashed his Self-Punishment Mysterious Technique. With the Self-Punishment Mysterious Technique activated, a 'Heaven' character appeared on his forehead.<br>Once the Heaven-level Lightning Mark appeared, Chu Zhiyuan's aura immediately increased from rank eight True Immortal to rank nine True Immortal.<br>'It's actually also a Heaven-level Lightning Mark. His reputation as a genius is truly well-justified,' Chu Feng thought to himself.<br>Although he deeply disliked Chu Zhiyuan, Chu Feng had to admit that Chu Zhiyuan was a cultivation genius. After all, the Heavenly Punishment Mysterious Technique was second only to the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. It was most definitely not something that ordinary people were capable of learning.<br>If one were to successfully learn the Heavenly Punishment Mysterious Technique, it would be equivalent to them obtaining the title of genius.<br>"Woosh~~~"<br>After increasing his cultivation, Chu Zhiyuan flipped his wrist and revealed his Incomplete Immortal Armament. Needless to say, his Incomplete Immortal Armament was also of top quality.<br>That said, his Incomplete Immortal Armament was quite different from ordinary Incomplete Immortal Armaments.<br>Ordinary Incomplete Immortal Armament would generally be bladed weapons. After all, weapons would be able to unleash the most direct attacks, and could be used together with martial skills. They were very suited to martial cultivators.<br>However, the Incomplete Immortal Armament in Chu Zhiyuan's hand was actually a jar. The jar appeared to be very shabby-looking. However, it was emitting an extremely powerful aura.<br>When that jar appeared, Chu Feng actually started to have a faint feeling of unease.<br>For ordinary Incomplete Immortal Armaments, regardless of how strong they might be, they would all emit fierce Immortal power. However, the jar in Chu Zhiyuan's hand was emitting a completely opposite sort of aura. Its aura was similar to that of Her Lady Queen's aura.<br>To be exact, that jar was emitting a dark and sinister sort of power. Even though it was also very powerful, it was different from ordinary Immortal power.<br>That being said, Chu Zhiyuan's battle power still increased greatly after he unleashed that Incomplete Immortal Armament.<br>"If that's all you have, I'm afraid you will not be able to take care of me," Chu Feng said.<br>Even though Chu Feng was slightly surprised by Chu Zhiyuan's Heavenly Punishment Mysterious Technique and Incomplete Immortal Armament, the strength Chu Zhiyuan had revealed was only at the level of strength Chu Ruoshi had revealed before.<br>Such a level would not be able to even withstand a single attack from Her Lady Queen. Thus, how could he possibly take care of Chu Feng?<br>"Don't be so hurried, I'll let you know right away as to why I, Chu Zhiyuan, would still dare to take you on after witnessing the strength of your world spirit."<br>Chu Zhiyuan's gaze changed somewhat again after saying those words. It was an incomparably ruthless gaze. It was simply not a gaze that an ordinary human would have.<br>Soon, Chu Zhiyuan's eyes themselves started to change. His eyes actually turned crimson.<br>It was not only his eyes. Crimson symbols and runes also appeared on his body. The symbols and runes were so bright that their light actually penetrated through Chu Zhiyuan's clothes.<br>Even though Chu Zhiyuan was wearing clothes, one could still clearly see the crimson symbols and runes on his body.<br>With the appearance of the crimson symbols and runes, Chu Zhiyuan's body actually started to emit crimson gaseous flames. Not only that, but the size of Chu Zhiyuan's body also increased tenfold. He now resembled a small-scale giant as he stood not far away from Chu Feng.<br>Chu Zhiyuan simply no longer resembled a human. Instead, he resembled a demonic being.<br>Most importantly, Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s aura had increased once more. Following the appearance of the crimson symbols and runes, Chu Zhiyuan gained the heaven-defying battle power to surmount a level of cultivation.<br>The current Chu Zhiyuan was an entire level of cultivation stronger than Chu Ruoshi.<br>He was now capable of fighting on par against Her Lady Queen.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case. You&rsquo;ve actually trained in a demonic technique. Such a demonic technique, I bet you must&rsquo;ve killed many innocent people,&rdquo; Chu Feng narrowed his brows. Deep hatred and disgust was present in his eyes.<br>As a world spiritist, Chu Feng was able to clearly feel that the crimson gaseous flames emitted by Chu Zhiyuan were most definitely not an ordinary ability.<br>Chu Feng was able to smell an intense reek of blood, and hear miserable wails. There was even the sound of infants crying.<br>Ignoring the price that Chu Zhiyuan had to pay himself in order to learn that demonic technique, he must&rsquo;ve also taken countless innocent lives in order to obtain his heaven-defying battle power.<br>A person like him was simply scum among cultivators, someone that should be put to death.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. For the sake of this Bloodcurse, I have indeed killed quite a few people. However, what about it? The weaklings of this world are meant to be the stepping stones for the strong. It is their honor to die by my hand,&rdquo; Chu Zhiyuan said disapprovingly. It was as if what he had done was the truly correct thing.<br>&ldquo;You are truly scum. Even if you did not wish to eliminate me today, I, Chu Feng, would definitely eliminate you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Haha, Chu Feng, have you still not realized it upon seeing the current me? Did you really think that world spirit of yours will be capable of contending against me?&rdquo; Chu Zhiyuan burst into loud laughter that was filled with contempt.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after Chu Zhiyuan said those words, a stream of dark black gaseous flames suddenly burst forth from Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s body. In the blink of an eye, the dark black gaseous flames filled the entire vast cave.<br>When those dark black gaseous flames were emitted, Chu Zhiyuan and Chu Ruoshi&rsquo;s expressions immediately changed.<br>The reason for that was because they had both discovered that Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s crimson gaseous flames were actually retracting after Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s dark black gaseous flames appeared. Not only were they retracting, but the crimson gaseous flames that were originally very majestically imposing started to squirm nonstop.<br>The appearance of the crimson gaseous flames resembled the trembling of humans.<br>The demonic technique that Chu Zhiyuan had slaughtered countless innocent people to learn was actually revealing a state of panic and fear upon facing Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s Asura gaseous flames. <br></p></div>
