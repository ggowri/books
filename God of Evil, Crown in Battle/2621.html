        <div> - By Killing You<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Eeaahhh!!!&rdquo;<br>After his right arm was sliced off, Ying Mingchao immediately covered his wound with his left hand. Not only did he immediately move back, but his expression also grew distorted, and he started screaming.<br>When Ying Mingchao let out his scream, Zi Xunyi, Chu Feng and the others all felt that the situation was extremely bad.<br>Ying Mingchao was a man of steel. He was most definitely not someone who would scream like that just from a superficial wound.<br>There was only a single possibility as to why Ying Mingchao screamed like that. That is, the seemingly normal pain from having his arm sliced off was actually an unbearable pain. Otherwise, there would not be a reason for Ying Mingchao to act like this.<br>&ldquo;That weapon.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, Chu Feng also noticed the golden dagger the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster held in his left hand. It was not an ordinary weapon.<br>That was simply not an Ancestral Armament. The reason for that was because Chu Feng felt the same sort of aura from that dagger as the aura he felt from Li Yuer&rsquo;er&rsquo;s pink sword.<br>That dagger was an Immortal Armament. This Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster actually possessed an Immortal Armament.<br>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to escape.&rdquo;<br>Right at the moment when Ying Mingchao was retreating from the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster tossed away the Ancestral Armament he held with his right hand and grabbed toward Ying Mingchao with his palm.<br>&ldquo;Huu, huu, huu~~~&rdquo;<br>In an instant, overwhelming suction energy was emitted from the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster. In an instant, it completely enveloped Ying Mingchao, who was moving away.<br>Even though Ying Mingchao was extremely powerful, he was actually like a trapped chicken. No matter how hard he struggled, he was unable to break free from the suction energy. In the end, he could only look on helplessly as he was caught in the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster&rsquo;s grasp.<br>At the moment when Ying Mingchao was about to reach the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster did not capture Ying Mingchao. Instead, he closed his palm, forming a blade hand, and pierced it directly into Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s dantian.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>Ying Mingchao let out another painful scream. The reason for that was because the dark black gaseous flames that lingered around the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster were currently pouring into Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s body in a steady stream.<br>Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s skin started to turn purple. Black lines also started to appear on his purple skin. Those black lines were like veins as they covered Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s entire body.<br>In this sort of situation, Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s aura started to grow weaker and weaker. Not to mention rank two True Immortal, his current aura was inferior to even an ordinary Martial Ancestor.<br>The current Ying Mingchao was like a person suffering from an extreme poison. The sight was truly appalling.<br>&ldquo;Do you now know why I dared to come kill you all by myself?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because of this Incomplete Immortal Armament, the Dragonscale Dagger,&rdquo; The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said as he fiddled with his golden dagger.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s actually an Incomplete Immortal Armament?&rdquo;<br>After hearing what the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said, Chu Feng finally realized that powerful weapon was not an actual Immortal Armament, but rather an Incomplete Immortal Armament.<br>However, the weapon in the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster&rsquo;s hand possessed a very similar aura to Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s pink sword. This meant that Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s weapon was actually also only an Incomplete Immortal Armament, and not an actual Immortal Armament.<br>This made sense. After all, Immortal Armaments were extremely powerful. Even though True Immortals were powerful, they remained to only be at the beginning of the Immortal realms. As such, they would naturally not be able to handle a true Immortal Armament.<br>In fact, Chu Feng felt that even though that dagger was only an Incomplete Immortal Armament, that Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was still unable to completely master its control. Instead, he had merely unleashed a portion of its power.<br>However, even though it was only a portion of its power, it made him invincible in battle and allowed him to easily defeat Ying Mingchao.<br>From this, it could be seen how powerful Incomplete Immortal Armaments were.<br>They were weapons that mere Ancestral Armaments could not compare to.<br>Although it was only an Incomplete Immortal Armament, the disparity between it and Ancestral Armaments was as enormous as the disparity between True Immortals and Martial Ancestors. It was so wide that it was simply uncrossable.<br>&ldquo;Let go of Mingchao!!!&rdquo;<br>Zi Xunyi shouted anxiously and furiously.<br>She simply did not care about how the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster managed to defeat Ying Mingchao. All she cared about was Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s safety.<br>&ldquo;Yo, Mingchao here and Mingchao there. That&rsquo;s quite a close way to call him, no? Seems like you should be Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s sweetheart, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want Ying Mingchao to die? That&rsquo;s fine. Get on your knees and kowtow to me. Beg me to not kill him and I&rsquo;ll consider sparing his life,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;You promise?&rdquo; Zi Xunyi asked.<br>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;Xunyi, you must not! You cannot trust this animal! Do not kneel to this anim&hellip;&rdquo; Ying Mingchao shouted.<br>&ldquo;Eeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before Ying Mingchao could finish his words, the hand that the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster pierced into his dantian started to tremble. Following that, Ying Mingchao sprayed out a mouthful of blood.<br>That blood was black. Furthermore, it was very gooey, and was even emitting a stink.<br>After Ying Mingchao vomited out the blood, half of his pitch-black long hair turned white. Even his face aged greatly.<br>In an instant, his appearance went from that of a middle-aged man to an old man.<br>&ldquo;Ying Mingchao, I know that your ego is very big. Truth be told, what our Infant Soul Sect feared the most back then was you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for the Kong Heavenly Clan and the Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s plot to kill you back then, with the momentum that you had, our Infant Soul Sect would&rsquo;ve likely already ceased to exist in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, things are very different now. The current me is no longer the same as the me from back then. You are no longer a threat to me,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster looked to Ying Mingchao with a beaming smile on his face.<br>Although he was smiling, his eyes were filled with hatred. It could be seen how much he hated Ying Mingchao.<br>Chu Feng was able to imagine that Ying Mingchao must&rsquo;ve made the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster suffer greatly back then. Else, he would not detest Ying Mingchao so much now.<br>&ldquo;Release them! If you have the ability, then aim at me!&rdquo; Ying Mingchao shouted. However, not only was his voice no longer vigorous, but it was instead incomparably weak and hoarse. It was as if a dying old man were speaking.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Ying Mingchao said those words, the hand that had pierced into Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s dantian trembled once more. Then, Ying Mingchao once again vomited a mouthful of blood.<br>At this moment, Ying Mingchao aged enormously once again. His hair had turned fully white. Wrinkles covered his face. His flesh was gone, and his skin started to cling tightly to his bones.<br>The current Ying Mingchao simply no longer resembled a vigorous and heroic hero. Instead, he had become someone with one foot in the grave.<br>&ldquo;You are unable to even take care of yourself right now,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster mocked. Then, he looked to Zi Xunyi, &ldquo;His life is in your hands right now. You decide what you want to do.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kneel, I&rsquo;ll kneel. Please stop torturing him,&rdquo; Zi Xunyi&rsquo;s face was already covered with tears. As she spoke, she lowered her knees. She was truly planning to kneel.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at this moment, a hand held onto Zi Xunyi&rsquo;s arm and turned her around.<br>It was Chu Feng. Not only was Chu Feng currently standing beside Zi Xunyi, but he was also holding onto the Evil God Sword tightly.<br>&ldquo;Senior Zi, even if you are to kneel to someone like him, he will definitely not spare Senior Ying.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In fact, he simply never planned to spare any of us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There is only one way to save Senior Ying from his hands,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Zi Xunyi.<br>&ldquo;And what might that be?&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster asked with a beaming smile.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng turned his murderous-looking gaze toward the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>With an incomparably cold tone, he said, &ldquo;By killing you!!!&rdquo;<br><br></p></div>
