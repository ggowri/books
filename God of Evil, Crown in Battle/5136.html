        <h1>Chapter 5135</h1>
        <div>: Friends All Gone<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky that I set up a teleportation formation in advance just in case, or else I would have been dead meat. It wasn&rsquo;t easy for me to survive from the Ancient Era till now. Those in the present era haven&rsquo;t even heard of my great name yet. I would feel so aggrieved if I were to die just like that.&rdquo;<br>Lord Bai patted his chest in fright. However, he soon regained his composure and started thinking back about the earlier encounter.<br>Moments later, he widened his eyes in horror.<br>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not right. That formation was not made up of spirit power but martial power. Even back in the Ancient Era, there aren&rsquo;t many who can utilize martial power formations with such prowess, but to think that such talent would appear in the present era!<br>&ldquo;On top of that, the natural energies of Ancestral Martial Realm were clearly absorbed by the forbidden land, but it&rsquo;s impossible to sense it unless one advances into the depths of the Heavenly Road. If I hadn&rsquo;t followed Chu Feng to the forbidden land, I wouldn&rsquo;t have realized the truth either.<br>&ldquo;A mysterious forbidden land and a powerful protective formation made purely out of martial power&hellip; Just what in the world is the Chu Clan?&rdquo;<br>Lord Bai couldn&rsquo;t help but look in Chu Feng&rsquo;s direction.<br>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be good of me to keep following young friend Chu Feng, but I can hardly stifle my curiosity anymore&hellip; I&rsquo;ll just go and take a glance!&rdquo;<br>With those words, Lord Bai began making his way toward where Chu Feng was.<br>At this very moment, Chu Feng had arrived at Misty Peak, only to realize that those who were on good terms with him were no longer there. To be more exact, they had all disappeared&hellip;<br>What was bewildering was that the others were still safe and sound.<br>According to the other members of the Misty Peak, those whom he was on close terms with had vanished overnight. A scroll was left in the sleeping chambers of Lady Piaomiao, but none of the members were able to get close to it, let alone open it.<br>Upon hearing those words, Chu Feng hurriedly made his way to Lady Piaomiao&rsquo;s sleeping chamber. There was indeed a scroll floating in mid-air there.<br>There was a protective formation around the scroll that prevented other people from coming close, but surprisingly, when Chu Feng approached it, the protective formation unraveled and the scroll floated toward him.<br>Chu Feng received the scrolland unrolled it, revealing a scenery painting.<br>It depicted a tall volcano that towered above a mountain range, rising above the clouds. The surrounding mountains were all covered in greenery, but for some reason, the volcano was shrouded in snow.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart lurched when he saw the painting. The mysterious man who had taken away the Chu Heavenly Clansmen had left a painting behind too, and the content was the exact same.<br>It was likely that Lady Piaomiao and the others had been kidnapped by the same person who had kidnapped the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>Chu Feng proceeded to question those on the Misty Peak for details, and they replied that they had tried investigating the matter. Some of them even left the Misty Peak to request help from others.<br>However, they soon discovered that everyone whom Chu Feng was on close terms with in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm had vanished without a trace, leaving behind scrolls similar to the one in Lady Piaomiao&rsquo;s sleeping chamber.<br>Such was the case for the Azure Dragon School and the Cyanwood Mountain.<br>Chu Feng immediately made his way to the Azure Dragon School and the Cyanwood Mountain. There were indeed scrolls there too. All of them were imbued with a protective formation that automatically unraveled at his presence and floated toward him.<br>They depicted the exact same painting.<br>Unfortunately, there were no other clues aside from that.<br>The Ancestral Martial Lower Realm was the same as ever, but everyone whom Chu Feng was close with had disappeared, be it Chu Yuan, Chu Guyu, Chu Yue, the Azure Dragon School&rsquo;s Azure Dragon Founder, Monstrous Monkey King, Li Changqing, Zhuge Liuyun&hellip;<br>Or the Eastern Sea Region&rsquo;s Lady Piaomiao, Qiushui Fuyan, Qiu Canfeng, Huangfu Haoyue, Chun Wu, Qiu Zhu, Dong Xue, the Holy Land of Martialism&rsquo;s Dugu Xingfeng, Bai Ruochen, Tantai Xue&hellip;<br>Or Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang&hellip;<br>In any case, everyone whom Chu Feng was on good terms with had disappeared.<br>Even the experts from the Chu Heavenly Clan dispatched by the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had vanished without a trace.<br>&ldquo;Damn it, just what is he up to?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was infuriated. There was no grudge between him and that mysterious man, but why was the latter kidnapping everyone whom he cared for? It was almost as if the mysterious man had left behind those paintings to brag that he was the culprit.<br>According to those from the Azure Dragon School and Cyanwood Mountain, those whom Chu Feng was close with had vanished at the same time as when the Chu Heavenly Clansmen disappeared. That proved that they were kidnapped at the same time.<br>With that, Chu Feng returned to the Misty Peak, hoping to see if he could meet the terrifying giant face that came from the Ancient Era. It possessed terrifying strength and the Misty Peak was its territory, so there was no way it would have been oblivious when someone kidnapped the members of the Misty Peak.<br>However, the terrifying giant face refused to answer Chu Feng&rsquo;s calls. In the end, he could only give up on the notion.<br>While he was infuriated at the kidnapping of his family and friends, he had a feeling that they were still safe. On top of that, there was a good chance that they were currently on the volcano shown in the painting. As long as he could find the place, he would be able to find them.<br>So, Chu Feng left the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm and returned to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>What he didn&rsquo;t know was that someone had been following him while he was running about the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, and that person was none other than Lord Bai.<br>However, Lord Bai didn&rsquo;t return to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm with Chu Feng. Instead, he stayed at the Misty Peak and casually constructed a spirit formation gate before stepping through it.<br>On the other side of the spirit formation gate was the realm where the terrifying giantface dwelled.<br>&ldquo;Woah. I never thought that I would meet an old friend here.&rdquo;<br>The place was littered with white bones, but Lord Bai still looked exceptionally delighted as if he had met an old friend.<br>The dark clouds in the sky billowed, and a massive face that covered the entire sky soon came into appearance.<br>&ldquo;Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal, you&rsquo;re still alive?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
