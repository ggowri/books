        <h1>Chapter 2637</h1>
        <div> - Bitterly Disappointed<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Today, the Infant Soul Sect shall perish!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded from the heavens. That voice forcibly suppressed the unified shouts from the hundreds of millions of people.<br>The crowd present were all surprised upon hearing that voice.<br>The current Infant Soul Sect could be said to be everyone&rsquo;s light of dawn, a light that would increase their cultivations. As such, how could someone dare say these sorts of words at a time like this?<br>It was simply outrageous and insolent behavior.<br>&ldquo;Finally, you&rsquo;re here. Ying Mingchao&hellip; I knew that you would come.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster cast his gaze to the distant sky with a beaming smile on his face.<br>As the people present were mostly of a low level of cultivation, they were simply unable to see that far into the distance. However, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was, after all, a rank two True Immortal. With his strength, he would naturally be able to see very far into the distance.<br>Thus, he had already noticed the allied army that was proceeding toward Chen Heavenly City.<br>Soon, the allied army led by Ying Mingchao appeared before the crowd&rsquo;s field of view.<br>&ldquo;Ying Mingchao. It really is them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What? Ying Mingchao has come? Why did they come here?&rdquo;<br>Although not everyone present was able to see Ying Mingchao and the others, they all came to know of their arrival from the conversations of others.<br>&ldquo;Ying Mingchao, was the humiliation you received that day not enough for you? You actually still dare to come cause a disturbance?&rdquo; The Immortal Sword School&rsquo;s Headmaster said to Ying Mingchao.<br>&ldquo;Amitabha, Almsgiver Ying, why must you do this?&rdquo;<br>The Abbot of the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple also stood up. There was a trace of mockery in his tone.<br>&ldquo;Ying Mingchao, Lord Sectmaster has already spared you once. Yet, you dare to come stir up trouble again? How could there be someone as shameless as you?&rdquo;<br>More and more people present started to mock Ying Mingchao and the others.<br>They were all people who were ignorant of the truth. They were people that believed that the Infant Soul Sect was truly going to help them.<br>Furthermore, they had no idea that the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster went to secretly chase after Ying Mingchao and the others to kill them.<br>All they knew was that Ying Mingchao had led the allied army to attack the Infant Soul Sect, but was instead defeated by the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>However, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster decided to let Ying Mingchao go.<br>Thus, they felt that the fact that Ying Mingchao and the others dared to come create a disturbance today meant that they were shameless pests.<br>As such, they naturally started to look down on Ying Mingchao and the others. Some among them also started to verbally attack Ying Mingchao and the others.<br>&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t witnessed it myself, I truly would never have believed that the renowned Lord Ying Mingchao was actually this sort of man.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truly one may know a person for a long time, yet never understand their true nature.&rdquo;<br>More and more people started to mock Ying Mingchao. In fact, even those that did not witness what happened that day, and even people that were unable to even see Ying Mingchao and the others started mocking Ying Mingchao.<br>At that moment, the great hero in the eyes of countless people had become the target of criticism from all around. He had become the object of public disgust, and even the target of hatred.<br>&ldquo;Truly fools.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that bunch of fickle people, Ying Mingchao revealed deep disgust on his face.<br>Ying Mingchao had already witnessed a lot of selfish actions in his life. However, the scene before him caused him to be bitterly disappointed.<br>After all, many of the people that were verbally attacking him were people who had previously worshipped and admired him.<br>Yet, for the sake of self-interest, they immediately changed their attitudes.<br>Such a rapid change in attitude had caused Ying Mingchao to feel utterly disappointed.<br>Right at that moment, Wang Qiang walked out from the allied army. He walked to the front of the ally army and said, &ldquo;In-Infant Soul S-Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster, is it? W-W-Where is my B-Brother C-Chu Feng right now?&rdquo;<br>However, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster simply ignored him.<br>The reason for that was because the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster felt that even though Wang Qiang possessed some reputation in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, he was nowhere near qualified enough to talk to him.<br>He felt that the only person in the allied army that was qualified to talk to him was Ying Mingchao.<br>Seeing that the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was ignoring him, Wang Qiang revealed a large blade and pointed it at the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster. He shouted, &ldquo;Your g-granddaddy is questioning you right n-now! D-Don&rsquo;t you p-play d-deaf and mute w-with me! A-Answer me immediately!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This Wang Qiang&rsquo;s aura?&rdquo;<br>Once Wang Qiang spoke again, all the experts from the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s side revealed a change in expression.<br>Even the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster had a surprised expression in his eyes when he looked to Wang Qiang again.<br>They were all able to sense that Wang Qiang&rsquo;s aura was that of a rank two True Immortal.<br>Furthermore, they noticed that even though the weapon in Wang Qiang&rsquo;s hand resembled a kitchen cleaver, it was actually an Ancestral Armament. Furthermore, it was a top quality Ancestral Armament.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking about Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Chu Feng escape with Ying Mingchao that day? How would I know where he is?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you want to ask someone, you should be asking Ying Mingchao instead,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said with a confused expression on his face.<br>&ldquo;T-Truly to p-pretend to be s-stupid, is it? V-Very well, I&rsquo;ll beat the t-truth out of you!&rdquo;<br>Wang Qiang was disinclined to bother with superfluous words. He raised his Vegetable Cutting Edge and hacked it down toward the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>A slash was sent forth from the sky to the ground. Even the air and space itself were sliced in half by it.<br>That powerful slash could be said to be truly capable of splitting apart the heavens and cleaving apart the earth. It directly shot toward Chen Heavenly City, where hundreds of millions of people were gathered.<br>If that slash were to successfully reach the Chen Heavenly City, it would definitely cause countless people to lose their lives.<br>However, Wang Qiang did not care about that. He only wanted to avenge Chu Feng, and simply could not care about the lives of those selfish fools.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster also revealed his Ancestral Armament. With a wave of his hand, he also shot forth a slash. That slash managed to block Wang Qiang&rsquo;s incoming slash outside of the Chen Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;If you want to kill me, then come at me directly! Do not harm the innocent!&rdquo; The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster shouted. As he spoke, he actually had a faint trace of anger in his tone.<br>Hearing those words, the people that were previously enveloped by Wang Qiang&rsquo;s attack, those people that felt that a great catastrophe was about to befall them, were all moved to tears.<br>They actually all ended up really considering the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster as a great hero who considered their well-being.<br>&ldquo;Y-You&rsquo;re q-quite an actor. V-Very g-g-good, your daddy shall s-see how much longer you can c-continue your pretense!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was fond of being pretentious and putting on a show before the crowd, Wang Qiang decided that he might as well send forth countless more slashes with his Vegetable Cutting Edge.<br>Although the slashes Wang Qiang sent forth this time around were about as powerful as his previous slashes, the scope of his attack was many times larger than his previous attack.<br>Furthermore, not a single one of his slashes that he sent forth this time around was aimed at the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>Instead, the many slashes were all aimed at the people inside Chen Heavenly City.<br>Wang Qiang wanted to see exactly how much longer the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster could continue to put up his disguise for.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster reacted extremely fast. Right after Wang Qiang sent forth his attacks, he immediately sent forth counterattacks. Many slashes were also shot out from his Ancestral Armament.<br>As explosions sounded, he actually managed to really block Wang Qiang&rsquo;s slashes. He had successfully prevented those innocent people from being injured or killed by Wang Qiang&rsquo;s slashes.<br>&ldquo;Wang Qiang, you are truly too excessive! You actually planned to willfully slaughter the innocent!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, on behalf of all living things in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, I, Hun Poyuan, shall eliminate a scourge like you!&rdquo; The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster held his Ancestral Armament in hand and rushed to attack Wang Qiang.<br>That said, when he rushed to attack Wang Qiang, he even gave himself a title of being righteous and fighting for justice.<br><br></p></div>
