        <div><span>: Unfair Challenge</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;Are you saying that we&rsquo;re weak? Who do you think you are?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Infuriated, the juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion glared at Chu Feng and gritted their teeth. Some of them even released their spirit power to prove their own worth.</span><br><span>To be fair, these juniors were no pushovers. Even the weakest of them was at White Dragon God-cloak, but the strongest was only at Gray Dragon God-cloak. The strongest junior here was none other than Jie Yu.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why are you shouting at me? I&rsquo;m not the one who thinks that you&rsquo;re weak. It&rsquo;s Jie Yu who looks down on you! Why else do you think he&rsquo;s unwilling to form a team with you? It&rsquo;s obvious that he thinks that you&rsquo;ll drag him down!&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed at Jie Yu as he spoke.</span><br><span>The juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion turned to look at Jie Yu. They dared not to confront Jie Yu, but their eyes made it clear that they were waiting for an answer from him. All of a sudden, the pressure was on Jie Yu.</span><br><span>Jie Yu&rsquo;s complexion turned awful. He was so used to others fawning on them that he was blindsided by Chu Feng&rsquo;s brazenness to sow discord.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to his nonsense. How could I possibly think that you are weak? I only refused to accept the challenge because I&rsquo;m more than enough to deal with them. Others might think that we are bullies if we take advantage of them here!&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>He then turned to Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing and said, &ldquo;The two of you can join hands if you want, but I don&rsquo;t need any help.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng was surprised by Jie Yu&rsquo;s quick wits, but he didn&rsquo;t lose his nerves because of it. Instead, he calmly said, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that make us bullies then?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Jie Yu replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;But I do. Our reputation matters as much as yours. If we&rsquo;re going to have a competition, we might as well have a fair one. Since that&rsquo;s the case, why don&rsquo;t we compete one-on-one then, just you and me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You? Are you certain?&rdquo; Jie Yu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine with me&hellip; but the only reason I&rsquo;m not asking anything from Bai Yunqing is </span><span>due to him having lost to me in the past. I won&rsquo;t be giving you the same leeway,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Sure. What do you want if I lose?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hmm, I doubt that you would have anything good on you considering your poor appearance. Bai Yunqing calls you big brother, right? Well, I&rsquo;ll have you address me as &lsquo;grandpa&rsquo; whenever you meet me if you lose this duel,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even dream about it!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing exclaimed. He turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Big brother, don&rsquo;t accept his bet.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing knew that Chu Feng was standing up for him, which was why he couldn&rsquo;t allow the latter to be humiliated in such a manner. He knew that people like Chu Feng valued their dignity far more than material possession.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile. He then turned to Jie Yu and said, &ldquo;I told you that fairness is important to me.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng opened his palm and conjured a wisp of spirit power.</span><br><span>&ldquo;White Dragon God-cloak?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Some of the juniors were impressed upon learning that Chu Feng was a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. The fact that he could reach this height at such a young age showed that he was highly talented.</span><br><span>Chu Feng proceeded to manifest a longevity pendant with his spirit power.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a longevity pendant on top of calling you &lsquo;grandpa&rsquo; if I lose the bet. Conversely, if you lose, you&rsquo;ll have to hand over that longevity pendant and call me &lsquo;grandpa&rsquo; whenever you see me from this day onward,&rdquo; Chu Feng said. &ldquo;I hope you aren&rsquo;t getting intimidated.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Intimidated? You must be joking. Fine, let&rsquo;s do just that!&rdquo; Jie Yu sneered with confidence.</span><br><span>Chu Feng smiled. He had intentionally revealed that he was a White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist in order to bait Jie Yu into taking up the bet, and things went just as he had planned.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>The gate at the mountain peak slowly opened.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I hereby announce the commencement of the trial,&rdquo; the old woman said.</span><br><span>The juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion immediately began making their way into the gate. Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing did the same too, but the old woman suddenly stopped them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she asked.</span><br><span>The juniors halted their footsteps, curious to see what was going on.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re entering the trial,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing replied with an uncomprehending frown.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who told you that you&rsquo;ll be allowed to enter the trial together with the young masters and young misses of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion? You&rsquo;ll enter from there!&rdquo; the old woman said as she pointed toward another gate located at a remote corner of the </span><span>mountain peak.</span><br><span>This gate was much humbler than the grand gate that stood before them, spanning the height of only an adult man.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What do you mean by this?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This is Lord Shuang Yu&rsquo;s order. You&rsquo;ll be entering the trial from there,&rdquo; the old woman said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo; Jie Yu burst into laughter. &ldquo;All the best, Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing.&rdquo;</span><br><span>He proceeded to enter the trial from the huge gate.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You spoke about fairness? Hah! Fairness is not something to be demanded. You have to earn it!&rdquo; The other juniors also entered the trial amidst laughter.</span><br><span>All of them understood the significance of that little gate, which was why they knew that the bet was already over even before it had even started.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What does this mean? Aren&rsquo;t we supposed to take on the same trial as them?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing grumbled unhappily.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I did say that you can participate in the same trial as them, but I never said that you will be entering from the same entrance,&rdquo; the old woman said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you mention it when we were making a bet with Jie Yu then?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why should I interfere in your duel? I&rsquo;ll tell you right now that you&rsquo;ll have to walk a path that is at least many times longer and more dangerous should you enter through that gate, so if you want to back out, this is the time to do so. You were the ones who came looking for us. I didn&rsquo;t beg you to take this trial,&rdquo; the old woman said with a forceful attitude.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Milady Queen lost her temper. She didn&rsquo;t want Chu Feng to face this insult.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Calm down, Milady Queen. Hah, this is exactly the kind of challenge I like.&rdquo; Chu Feng smirked. He showed no signs of anger at all, unlike Bai Yunqing and Eggy.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you don&rsquo;t have to lower your pride for me. Let&rsquo;s not be humiliated in such a manner.&rdquo; Eggy knew that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t the type of person to swallow his pride. He was only doing this for her sake.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Eggy, we have already made a bet. I can&rsquo;t back down now. This is my first encounter with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. I have to win this battle.&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to the old woman and asked, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just ask one question. The winner of this trial, regardless of which entrance they enter from, will be entitled to the Life Crystal?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the old woman answered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How many?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How many?&rdquo; The old woman burst into laughter before answering, &ldquo;One.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Only one?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s face darkened. That was far from enough.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why? Is that not enough for you? That&rsquo;s big talk coming from someone who won&rsquo;t even be able to clear a trial. I&rsquo;m merely giving you a chance for the sake of it. I should also </span><span>remind you that the trial has already begun. You better hurry up if you want to participate in the trial, or else it&rsquo;ll be best for you to back out right now,&rdquo; the old woman said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing looked at Chu Feng with a displeased look. Had he not chosen to follow Chu Feng&rsquo;s decision, he would have already backed out of the competition by now.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Will it be dangerous inside?&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed to the little gate and asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes. I have already said that,&rdquo; the old woman replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;But the others who entered via the huge gate will be safe?&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed to the huge gate that the juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had entered through and asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the old woman replied with a smile.</span><br><span>She was explicitly conveying to Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing that they weren&rsquo;t entitled to the same treatment as the juniors of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked with a smile. He turned to Bai Yunqing and said, &ldquo;I was the one who made that bet with Jie Yu; it&rsquo;ll suffice for me to enter alone. Wait here for me.&rdquo;</span><br><span>He began making his way to the little gate after saying those words, but a silhouette caught up with him right away. It was Bai Yunqing.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing clicked his tongue at Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Big brother, you&rsquo;re thinking lightly of me. Brothers ought to brave difficulties together! How can you even think about leaving me behind?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng laughed upon hearing those words. &ldquo;Very well. Let us challenge the unfairness of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion together!&rdquo;</span><br></p></div>
