        <h1>Chapter 4284</h1>
        <div> - Wipe Out Your Entire Clan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That oppressive might came from beneath the ground.<br>By the time Chu Feng and the others sensed that oppressive might, their surroundings had been sealed off by it.<br>Without any more teleportation formations, Chu Feng and others were all trapped here.<br>In fact, it could even be said that their lives were in the hands of that experts from the Galewind Hunting Clan.<br>&ldquo;Say, everyone from the Galewind Hunting Clan, we were merely making some inquiries.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you all were unhappy with us entering your territory, we&rsquo;ve left immediately.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is it really necessary for you to go to this extent?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Must you chase us up here?&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Even Grandmaster Tang Chen was panicking from the terror of that oppressive might. Yet, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, regardless of what he might be feeling, was putting forth a calm demeanor.<br>It could even be said that he was showing no sign of fear at all.<br>Once the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said those words, that Galewind Hunting Clansman&rsquo;s voice also sounded.<br>&ldquo;Since when was our Galewind Hunting Clan a place where trash like you could come and go at will?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Last time, not only did you all infiltrate into our clan, you even injured my clansmen and threatened us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why you all were able to escape safely last time was because we were unwilling to look into it. Did you really think that you all are on equal footings with our Galewind Hunting Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, you all will pay for what you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;<br>That voice was extremely deep, resounding and filled with killing intent.<br>When those words were heard, Chu Feng and others felt that they were doomed.<br>But, right after those words were spoken, Chu Feng and others couldn&rsquo;t help but be surprised.<br>The oppressive might was still surrounding them. Yet, it was not showing any moment. The slaughter they were anticipating did not occur...<br>While there was no movement from the Galewind Hunting Clan, Ox-nosed Old Daoist and others did not think they were safe. Instead, they grew even more uneasy. After all, they were still restricted by the terrifying oppressive might.<br>Because of that, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke again.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen also spoke.<br>He revealed that he was the one who injured the Galewind Hunting Clansmen before.<br>He even apologized for that occasion.<br>But, the Galewind Hunting Clan still showed no response.<br>It seemed as if they cannot hear the words spoken by Grandmaster Tang Chen and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Because of that, both Grandmaster Tang Chen and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist didn&rsquo;t know what to do. They had no idea exactly what the Galewind Hunting Clan was planning.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the oppressive might surrounding them began to change.<br>It began to fluctuate in intensity.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen turned to ask the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;How would I know?&rdquo; answered the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;What are we to do then? Since they&rsquo;re not responding, should we try escaping?&rdquo; proposed Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Escape? How? Where to?&rdquo; asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen didn&rsquo;t know how to answer.<br>While that oppressive might was fluctuating, it was still very powerful. It was true, they would not be able to escape.<br>They would only be able to escape if that oppressive might continued to weaken to a state that they could flee from.<br>&ldquo;Master, what&rsquo;s below seemed to be rather remarkable.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was observing below using his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes. He wanted to determine what was happening.<br>But, he discovered that there existed a special barrier below. The power of that barrier obstructed his vision. Chu Feng was simply unable to see what was going on below.<br>Hearing those words, Grandmaster Tang Chen also used his ability to examine downward.<br>Upon doing so, he had a look of fear.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that what&rsquo;s below us is also the Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s territory?&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen looked to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Was there even a need to ask that question? That&rsquo;s most likely the case.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So they&rsquo;ve already discovered us long ago. It&rsquo;s no wonder Chu Feng and I were still discovered by them even though everything was going smoothly,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>What the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said was correct.<br>Beneath them was the Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s territory.<br>Furthermore, the Galewind Hunting Clan below were able to detect the movements aboveground.<br>As such, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and others were already discovered by them when they were setting up the teleportation formation here.<br>Their conversations were also all heard by the Galewind Hunting Clan.<br>They&rsquo;ve been exposed from the very start.<br>That was the reason why Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist were discovered the moment they entered the Galewind Hunting Clan.<br>The reason for that was because the people from the Galewind Hunting Clan were waiting for their infiltration.<br>At this moment, many experts from the Galewind Hunting Clan were deep in the ground beneath where Chu Feng and others were.<br>They were in a practically perfectly constructed world. Although it was beneath the ground, it was practically not different from the surface world. There were mountains, rivers and everything else.<br>The vegetations here were also very beautiful and magnificent. They were all emitting an intense Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura. Those auras were not fake. They really exist.<br>The experts from the Galewind Hunting Clan were all standing in the sky of this seemingly perfect world.<br>These experts from the Galewind Hunting Clan were all emitting extraordinary auras.<br>Practically everyone of them were existences that Grandmaster Tang Chen could not take on.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen guessed correctly. The Galewind Hunting Clan was indeed unfathomable.<br>Among these experts, one was emitting an especially powerful aura.<br>THis person was the Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>The oppressive might that sealed off the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and others was released by him.<br>He was also the person who spoke earlier.<br>But, at this moment, this Lord Clan Chief of the Galewind Hunting Clan was frowning slightly.<br>The experts from the Galewind Hunting Clan behind him all had complicated expressions. It seemed as if they were facing great enemies.<br>The reason for their reactions was because there stood three figures across from them.<br>These three people were completely different from the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and others outside.<br>Not even the Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was able to see through their cultivations.<br>Not only that, those three individuals were all covered in a layer of light.<br>The light covered everything. They were unable to even see the appearances of the three individuals.<br>But, everything points to&hellip; those three people being very powerful and did not come with good intentions.<br>&ldquo;Who are you all?&rdquo; asked the Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief with a stern voice.<br>Compared to the overbearing attitude he displayed when he spoke to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and others earlier, the tone of his voice had grown much softer.<br>This change in attitude caused the expressions of the Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s experts to change.<br>Very rarely do they see their Lord Clan Chief speaking to others in such a manner.<br>&ldquo;You all are not qualified to know who we are.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We came here with the intention to inform you all one thing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My friend is up there. If he wanted to know anything, you are to answer him honestly. Do not make things difficult for him,&rdquo; said the leader of the three individuals.<br>&ldquo;Who did you think you are?! You dared to speak of conditions toward our Lord Clan Chief?!&rdquo;<br>At this moment, a Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s expert shouted furiously.<br>He was truly enraged. He looked down upon the martial cultivators of the present era to begin with. As such, he simply cannot tolerate people that he looked down upon speaking to his Lord Clan Chief in such a manner.<br>But, the leader of the three mysterious individuals actually smiled at that Galewind Hunting Clansman&rsquo;s threatening words. He said, &ldquo;I am not speaking conditions here. You all must do as I say.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Arrogant claptrap! You are courting death!!!&rdquo;<br>That Galewind Hunting Clansmen grew furious. As he spoke, he unleashed his killing intent and were intending to attack those three.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>But, before he could do anything, the surrounding space suddenly trembled violently. Then, a powerful aura swep forth and engulfed the entire region.<br>After that aura appeared, fear appeared in the eyes of that Galewind Hunting Clansman. In fact, even the Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had a look of fear in his eyes.<br>Right at this moment, the leader of the three spoke again. But, compared to his words before, what he said now was much more tyrannic.<br>&ldquo;I will give you all two choices.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can either do as I say.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Or, I will wipe out your entire clan.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
