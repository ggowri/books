        <h1>Chapter 2286</h1>
        <div> - Clear Cut Contrast<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>According to a legend, there once appeared two Divine Beasts at a certain region in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. They were two Dragons!!!<br>One was an ice dragon, whereas the other was a fire dragon.<br>When the two dragons galloped in the sky, they appeared to be capable of causing the destruction of both the heaven and earth. Their might was truly imposing and intimidating.<br>By chance, an expert in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm managed to see this scene of the two dragons soaring into the sky.<br>Seeing that astonishing scene, his martial power surged forth violently. In that very instant, he came to a sudden enlightenment.<br>As a result, that expert began to devote the rest of his life to comprehend what he had felt that day. In the end, he managed to create two Emperor Taboo Martial Skills.<br>Emperor Taboo: Ice Dragon Transformation.<br>Emperor Taboo: Fire Dragon Transformation.<br>The two martial skills were ice and fire. They both possessed incomparable might. Both of them were high quality Emperor Taboo Martial Skills.<br>However, the strongest aspect of the two martial skills were not themselves. Rather, it was when they were fused together.<br>According to that legend, as long as one could successfully fuse the two martial skills together, the might that one would obtain would surpass that of Emperor Taboo Martial Skills.<br>As for that martial skill capable of surpassing Emperor Taboo Martial Skills, it was the Fire and Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation.<br>By pure chance, the Three Stars Hall managed to obtain the two martial skills. Furthermore, they deemed the two martial skills as their most valuable, their hall protection, treasures.<br>Although the outstanding disciples and elders of the Three Stars Hall were all allowed to cultivate the two martial skills, very few people were actually able to grasp the Fire and Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation.<br>However, at that moment, it seemed that not only had Kou Kang grasped the two Emperor Taboo Martial Skills, he had also mastered them, bringing them to the transcendent level of the Fire and Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation.<br>&ldquo;Fire and Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Kou Kang shouted loudly. The two vortexes of fire and ice that he held in his palm shot out.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Once the two vortexes left his hand, their size increased rapidly, and they turned into two enormous dragons of fire and ice.<br>The two dragons possessed devastating power. When the two dragons coiled with one another, the might that they gave off felt akin to a choking sensation.<br>Not to mention people of the younger generation like Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu, even the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and the others revealed serious expressions. They were deeply worried for Chu Feng.<br>The reason for that was because not only had that legendary martial skill, the Fire and Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation, been successfully unleashed by Kou Kang, the two enormous dragons that formed from the martial skills were also rushing straight towards Chu Feng.<br>They did not possess the appearance of fighting till victory and defeat was determined. Instead, they were simply planning to take Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.<br>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, everyone felt that the situation was very bad for Chu Feng. Even though Kou Kang&rsquo;s Fire and Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation was confined to the palace hall and not truly world-shaking, its might definitely surpassed that of ordinary Emperor Taboo Martial Skills.<br>Would Chu Feng be able to take on such a powerful Emperor Taboo Martial Skill?<br>No. No one felt that Chu Feng would be able to take it on.<br>However, at the moment when everyone was worried for Chu Feng, at the time when experts like Su Jingrui were planning to act to save Chu Feng, no one noticed that Chu Feng had already firmly clenched his right fist.<br>Furthermore, wave upon wave of frightening martial power was being gathered inside his fist.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng shot forth his fist.<br>There was no special prior indication. However, once Chu Feng&rsquo;s fist was shot forth, it immediately revealed world-shaking might.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Surging energy ripples instantly filled the entire palace hall. Enormous power caused even the palace hall to sway left and right. Ear piercing thunder could even be heard outside the palace hall.<br>Many of the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s elders that were ignorant of what was happening even thought that something had happened. One by one, they unleashed their weapons and arrived outside of the palace, surrounding it.<br>While the outside of the palace was very chaotic, quite a major disturbance occurred inside the palace too.<br>Other than Chu Feng, all of the people present had dumbstruck expressions.<br>That legendary Emperor Taboo Martial Skill, that Fire and Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation, had disappeared.<br>Everyone was able to clearly see that the overwhelmingly powerful Fire and Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation was destroyed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s punch.<br>&ldquo;That was an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill. But, why would it be so powerful? It managed to defeat even the Fire and Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation with a single strike?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is as if that Fire and Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation was simply unable to contend against it.&rdquo;<br>The Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s headmaster felt great disbelief. As the headmaster of the Three Stars Hall, he knew very well that his disciple Kou Kang had already managed to unleash the Fire and Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation perfectly with the cultivation that he possessed. It would simply be impossible for ordinary Emperor Taboo Martial Skills to contend against the Fire and Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation.<br>Yet, Chu Feng&rsquo;s punch had managed to defeat the Fire and Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation.<br>Furthermore, although the might of Chu Feng&rsquo;s punch had disappeared, the Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s headmaster, the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui were all able to tell that the might of Chu Feng&rsquo;s punch had not been canceled out by the Fire and Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation.<br>Instead, it had been dispersed by Chu Feng.<br>If Chu Feng had not dispersed the might of his attack, even if Kou Kang managed to live through it, he would have been definitely be seriously injured.<br>The way they saw it, with the might of that punch, Kou Kang would have most likely died.<br>&ldquo;Brother Kou Kang&rsquo;s strength is truly extraordinary. I, Chu Feng, am truly in admiration.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would seem that our sparring today would have to end in a draw,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist.<br>It was not that Chu Feng did not wish to teach Kou Kang a lesson. Merely, he wanted to give the Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s headmaster face. Likewise, he also wanted to give face to the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui.<br>Taking his three seniors into consideration, Chu Feng decided to stop. At the very least, when the outcome of the spar was a tie, it would not be too humiliating for the Three Stars Hall.<br>After all, Kou Kang represented the Three Stars Hall.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, this sparring match is still not over. Let&rsquo;s contin...&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Cough, cough~~~&rdquo;<br>Kou Kang did not plan to stop. Merely, before he could finish his words, he burst into a series of violent coughs.<br>It could be seen that even though Kou Kang had managed to successfully unleash the Fire and Ice Coiling Dragons Transformation, that martial skill seemed to have brought an enormous burden onto his body.<br>&ldquo;Are you certain?&rdquo; Chu Feng frowned slightly. He was slightly displeased.<br>Chu Feng discovered that Kou Kang was truly a shameless person that refused one&rsquo;s good intentions. Chu Feng had already yielded to him, yet he still wanted to continue.<br>If this Kou Kang insisted on continuing with this spar against Chu Feng, Chu Feng would definitely teach him a lesson.<br>&ldquo;Of course. Victory or defeat must be determined from this sparring match,&rdquo; Kou Kang said firmly.<br>However, right at that moment, the Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s headmaster shouted loudly, &ldquo;Kang&rsquo;er, it&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master, I wish to continue&hellip;&rdquo; Kou Kang was unwilling to give up.<br>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; The Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s headmaster glared at Kou Kang angrily.<br>The reason for that was because he knew very well that Chu Feng was giving his Three Stars Hall face. That was why he did not defeat Kou Kang earlier.<br>However, this disciple of his was truly incapable of differentiating good from bad. That was the reason why he was furious.<br>&ldquo;Enough, enough, it was only a sparring match to begin with. Let&rsquo;s just stop.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s continue to drink wine,&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui said with smiles on their faces.<br>Although the two of them both declared that this match had ended in a tie, their gazes were fixed on Chu Feng.<br>Those gazes were filled with pleasant surprise.<br>After all, they knew that the match had not actually ended in a tie. Rather, Chu Feng had won.<br>They were pleasantly surprised, not because of Chu Feng&rsquo;s overwhelming battle power being at the level of an exceptional genius...<br>&hellip; but also because of Chu Feng&rsquo;s character.<br>Kou Kang had been aggressive from the beginning. He had been planning to embarrass Chu Feng. They were able to see through all of Kou Kang&rsquo;s intentions.<br>However, even in such a  situation, Chu Feng was actually still able to act leniently toward Kou Kang. This character of his was truly extraordinary.<br>Especially when compared to Kou Kang&rsquo;s aggressive and undiscriminating behavior. It was simply a clear-cut contrast to Chu Feng&rsquo;s lenient way of handling things.<br>This not only caused the Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and Su Jingrui to think even more highly of Chu Feng, even Kou Kang&rsquo;s master began to admire Chu Feng even more.<br>As for Kou Kang, even though he was feeling unreconciled, he did not dare to say anything after being glared at angrily by his master. After that he became completely silent, and didn&rsquo;t say a single word.<br>As the focus had turned to Chu Feng, even though Kou Kang was extremely depressed, no one bothered to pay attention to him.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, Daoist Gold Star is not someone easy to deal with. He will likely bear grudges for what happened here today for the rest of his life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With his personality, he will definitely attempt revenge against you. In the future, it would be best that you avoid places where he is,&rdquo; The Sunset Cloud Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Although we have already threatened him, with his personality, he will most likely come to create troubles for you still,&rdquo; The Three Stars Hall&rsquo;s headmaster added.<br><br></p></div>
