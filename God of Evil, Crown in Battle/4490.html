        <h1>Chapter 4489</h1>
        <div>: Holy Valley<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng had always believed that opportunity and risk came hand in hand. For this reason, he had never feared danger.<br>From the Lower Realm, where Martial Emperor level was viewed to be a legend, he climbed his way up a step at a time. It was through triumphing over danger after danger that he managed to thus far and make a place for himself in this world filled with Utmost Exalted level and Martial Exalted level cultivators.<br>There were many times that he could have died, but through conquering over those difficult situations, he was able to grow faster than those around him.<br>But while Chu Feng was daring, he was not reckless.<br>While his talent and tenacity played a huge role in how he was able to come, it would be all futile if he was without wits.<br>In order to ensure his safety, he first used his means to conceal himself first before entering the Whitesky Star River once more carefully.<br>He had a very clear goal in mind. As soon as he got close to the hidden current, he swallowed the pill that the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had given him previously, and he immediately felt a mysterious power surging through his body.<br>Following that, he dived into the hidden current.<br>His surroundings immediately changed as soon as he was inside the hidden current. At the same time, the hindrance that prevented him from perceiving the bones clearly vanished.<br>He was finally able to clearly feel what the state the bones were in.<br>The bones stacked up inside the hidden current had their source energies sapped away, so there was no doubt that they were thoroughly dead. However, there was one thing that left Chu Feng feeling deeply uneased&mdash;it hadn&rsquo;t been long since these monstrous beasts had died.<br>Based on his deduction, it was no more than three days since they were killed.<br>This realization left Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart beating so fast that he thought it would leap out of his heart. It was one thing if the culprit had left, but if the culprit were to still be loitering around the area, he would be in deep trouble.<br>But in any case, since he was already here, he wasn&rsquo;t going to leave with his hands empty.<br>So, Chu Feng sat down and prepared himself to cultivate.<br>&ldquo;There is a high concentration of natural energies in here, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem like there is any martial comprehension here. Did something happen here?&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked in disappointment.<br>Despite the high concentration of natural energies in here, it was impossible to raise one&rsquo;s cultivation quickly in here. This was at odds with what the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had told him.<br>Unwilling to give up just like that, Chu Feng began to observe his surroundings in hopes that there might be something more to this place.<br>His efforts paid off.<br>There was indeed martial comprehension concealed within the hidden current, but it was just a pity that he was unable to use them.<br>As if someone was manipulating their movement, they were flowing toward a specific direction within this hidden current. It felt like there was something absorbing the essence of this hidden current.<br>Perplexed, Chu Feng followed the flow of martial comprehension, but he soon found himself blocked by something. There should have been nothing in front of him, but he was unable to proceed any further, as if there was an invisible wall ahead of him.<br>It was a barrier, an incredibly resilient one.<br>However, perhaps it was to allow the natural energies in the hidden current to flow in, there were some openings in the barrier which Chu Feng knew he could exploit to breach the barrier.<br>The only problem was that he had no idea what lay within.<br>If it was just a naturally-formed barrier, his worry would have been unfounded. However, if this barrier was manmade, the person who was inside was very likely to be the culprit who had massacred the race from the Ancient Era.<br>If Chu Feng were to bump into such a person, he would be doomed.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gamble on it!&rdquo;<br>In the end, Chu Feng still decided to give it a try. He wasn&rsquo;t willing to give up when the endpoint was already right ahead of him.<br>Having made up his decision, he began setting up for a spirit formation to breach the barrier.<br>Even though Chu Feng was taking a chance here, he did weigh his pros and cons before making this move. In his view, the culprit who massacred the race from the Ancient Era was bound to be a terrifying existence.<br>It was understandable that the other party couldn&rsquo;t notice Chu Feng when he was still some distance away, but now that he was standing right before the barrier, it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense for the other party to have still not noticed him yet.<br>Since nothing was happening to him yet, he felt that there was a good chance that the culprit wasn&rsquo;t inside the barrier.<br>Ultimately, it was just his deduction, making this whole thing a gamble. But to his fortune, it seemed like he had gambled correctly.<br>Upon breaching the barrier, he was able to see everything happening inside clearly.<br>There was a waterlike pearl inside the barrier. It was around the size of a fist, and it was rotating at a very fast speed, forming something reminiscent of a whirlpool that drew the natural energies within the hidden current into it.<br>The concentration of natural energies grew higher toward the pearl, to the point that they seemed to condense into a tangible gaseous form.<br>Taking a closer look at the waterlike pearl, Chu Feng noticed that other than the natural energies it had absorbed, it also contained martial comprehension too. Almost everything valuable within the hidden current was now within the waterlike pearl.<br>If Chu Feng could take the pearl and use it for his own, his cultivation would surely advance significantly.<br>&ldquo;You sure are brazen to dare walk in here!&rdquo;<br>But just as Chu Feng was about to reach out to grab the pearl, an old voice suddenly sounded from the direction of the pearl.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart thumped wildly upon hearing that voice.<br>&ldquo;Was I mistaken?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was alarmed by the presence of another person in here, but he didn&rsquo;t immediately turn tail to escape. He knew that he would never be able to get away from the other party.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I don&rsquo;t mean any harm,&rdquo; Chu Feng quickly bowed deeply and said.<br>&ldquo;I know that you don&rsquo;t mean any harm, but you sure have guts!&rdquo;<br>The old voice sounded once more, and soon, two silhouettes came to appearance.<br>It was an old man and a young man.<br>The young man had a thin figure but a decently dashing appearance with a roguish vibe. His complexion was unnaturally pale, which made him look a little eerie despite his good looks.<br>As for the old man, he had an unusually buff figure. He had a head of lush white hair that was fluffed out like a lion&rsquo;s mane. Paired with his stern eyebrows and sharp gaze, he looked like a lion beast who had cultivated into a human.<br>The young man was quite tall for a human, standing at around a height of two meters. Despite so, he was still dwarfed by the old man, who stood at an imposing height of at least nine meters.<br>Put together with his massive physique, the old man really looked like a giant.<br>However, what Chu Feng&rsquo;s attention was focused on were the clothes they were wearing.<br>The old man and the young man were dressed in similar clothes, an exquisite black robe with crimson bloodlike embroidery at the sleeves and collar.<br>There were two words embroidered on the chest area of their robes&mdash;<br>Valley.<br>There was also a black token hanging by their waist with the words &lsquo;<br>Valley&rsquo; written on it in red brushstrokes.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I have come here to cultivate. I didn&rsquo;t know that you were here, or else I wouldn&rsquo;t have dared to interrupt you,&rdquo; Chu Feng bowed deeply once more as he began explaining the reason why he was here.<br>It was not that Chu Feng was being too timid here, but he knew that the duo before him were people he couldn&rsquo;t afford to offend. Or else, he might become the latest addition to the mountain of bones all around.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to speak any more. I understand your intentions here, and I know that you bear no malicious will toward here. In fact, I admire your courage. Despite the mountain of corpses outside, you still dared to walk into this place.<br>&ldquo;It seems like you have a strong desire for power. Cultivators who actively seek power are worthy of respect. The only mistake you made was that you shouldn&rsquo;t have allowed the two of us to see you. Now that our eyes are already on you, we have no choice but to send you off to the netherworld!&rdquo;<br>As the old man spoke, a cold glint flashed across his eyes.<br>Boom!<br>The water in the hidden current suddenly began bubbling furiously as a surge of energy wrapped itself around Chu Feng, sealing off his surroundings.<br>Sensing the tremendous power surrounding him, Chu Feng suddenly felt as if he had been plunged into hell. His life and death were no longer his to control anymore.<br>The old man before him was so powerful that Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t even gauge his cultivation accurately. All it would take was a single thought from the old man to wipe him away from the face of the world.<br>&ldquo;Am I really going to die here?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could feel the clutches of death gradually creeping closer and closer to him.<br>&ldquo;This feeling&hellip;?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyebrows suddenly shot up in astonishment.<br>A bizarre sight happened right after. The terrifying might that had sealed off Chu Feng abruptly vanished without a trace!<br></p></div>
