        <h1>Chapter 4988</h1>
        <div>: Rank Four Martial Exalted<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng sat down on the ground. His eyes were closed shut as if he had gone into cultivation. But why would he suddenly start cultivating when they were already in such a desperate situation?<br>Shortly after, nine-colored heavenly lightning filled the sky. Before the prowess of nature, everything else in the world looked insignificant in comparison.<br>It was a phenomenon that would only appear when someone who possessed a Heavenly Bloodline made a breakthrough. More importantly, when the heavenly lightning appeared, all of the hidden fireballs were forced out of their hiding.<br>They were still moving, but it was much easier to avoid them now that they were in plain sight.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, it worked! Do we head there now?&rdquo; Song Yun asked in agitation.<br>She had no idea how Chu Feng managed to pull it off, but she knew that this was the ideal opportunity for them to clear the trial. A second opportunity like this might not come again.<br>&ldquo;This little sister over here, don&rsquo;t disturb him. He&rsquo;s in a crucial phase of his breakthrough. If you&rsquo;re in a hurry, you may head there first,&rdquo; Zi Ling said.<br>&ldquo;What about you, big sister?&rdquo; Song Yun asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here to accompany big brother Chu Feng,&rdquo; Zi Ling said.<br>&ldquo;Big sister Lele, let&rsquo;s head over then,&rdquo; Song Yun said.<br>&ldquo;Yun&rsquo;er, you can go on ahead.&rdquo;<br>Wang Yuxian was also planning to stay behind and accompany Chu Feng. Seeing that, Song Yun&rsquo;s eyes narrowed sharply.<br>&ldquo;Big sister Lele, are you in love with big brother Chu Feng?&rdquo; she asked.<br>Wang Yuxian chuckled upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;What are you saying? I&rsquo;m just curious because Chu Feng seems to have discovered a way to decipher the mechanism, judging from how he was able to make the fireballs appear. I want to see what he&rsquo;s going to do,&rdquo; Wang Yuxian said.<br>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;<br>Song Yun doubted her words.<br>She wasn&rsquo;t doubting Chu Feng&rsquo;s capability but whether Wang Yuxian harbored feelings for him or not.<br>&ldquo;You can stay behind and accompany big brother Chu Feng then. I&rsquo;ll head on first to scout the path.&rdquo;<br>Song Yun eventually decided to proceed first.<br>Perhaps out of fear of the fireballs, Song Yun decided to reveal her rank one Martial Exalted level cultivation. She used a movement skill that allowed her to flit ahead with incredible speed.<br>She was able to easily weave through the fireball maze and arrive at the volcano.<br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s able to reach such a level of cultivation despite her young age?&rdquo; Zi Ling was surprised.<br>&ldquo;That girl is a guarded one. I doubt that her real cultivation is only at rank one Martial Exalted level,&rdquo; Wang Yuxian said.<br>Those words suggested that Song Yun was far stronger than she showed. It reminded her of how Song Yun was able to see through her despite her concealment.<br>Furthermore, Song Yun had asked whether Wang Yuxian was fond of Chu Feng despite being aware of Chu Feng and Zi Ling&rsquo;s relationship. That appeared like an attempt to create a rift in their relationship.<br>Everything that had happened thus far was telling her to tread cautiously around Song Yun.<br>Boom!<br>The nine-colored heavenly lightning fell shortly after, and the fireballs started crumbling in its face. That very instant, Zi Ling and Wang Yuxian finally understood the way to overcome this trial.<br>It seemed like all they had to do was to make a breakthrough.<br>&ldquo;I never thought that there would be such an opportunity lying in wait here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He rose to his feet with a smile, delighted at the strengthened martial power within his body. He had successfully made a breakthrough to rank four Martial Exalted level.<br>He had come here with the intention to advance his cultivation. While the heritage in the other ancient remnant had been taken away by Dugu Lingtian, he still managed to stumble upon another fortuitous encounter while he was on his way to help Zi Ling.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, is the mechanism fully destroyed now?&rdquo; Zi Ling asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes. Look.<br>Chu Feng released a surge of martial power.<br>This time, the martial power gushed out without triggering any fireballs, proving that all of the fireballs had disappeared.<br>Following that, Chu Feng explained the situation to Zi Ling and Wang Yuxian.<br>The pearl that Song Yun had taken out earlier wasn&rsquo;t a defensive tool but a clue, just as the humanoid monster said. The clue revealed all of the fireballs, which formed a complete picture.<br>The picture contained profound comprehension of martial cultivation, such that anyone who managed to grasp it would be able to significantly raise their cultivation. That became an impetus for Chu Feng&rsquo;s breakthrough.<br>As long as one was able to make a breakthrough via the fireball mechanism, one would be able to remove all of the fireballs.<br>That was also the reason why Chu Feng suddenly sat down and started cultivating.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see any martial comprehension from the fireball mechanism all this while, but you were able to grasp it from just a momentary look? Is that the difference between a true prodigy and normal cultivators? It&rsquo;s no wonder why that elder had such a high opinion of you,&rdquo; Wang Yuxian exclaimed in astonishment.<br>She was not teasing Chu Feng but remarking out of true awe. If Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t explained the situation to her, she would have never known that there was profound martial comprehension hidden amidst the fireball mechanism.<br>&ldquo;Stop teasing me. Song Yun has already proceeded on ahead of us, so let&rsquo;s hurry over too. I&rsquo;m worried about leaving her alone.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was aware of Song Yun&rsquo;s cultivation, as well as the conversation she had with Wang Yuxian earlier.<br>By this point, Song Yun had already entered the volcano. There was some kind of power isolating the volcano from the world outside, disallowing Chu Feng from seeing what was going on inside.<br>So, he quickly flitted over together with Zi Ling and Wang Yuxian while chatting.<br>The volcano was relentlessly spitting out lava. Its heat could be felt even from a distance away, but it didn&rsquo;t deal much harm. What was even weirder was that even though lava was spilling out from the center of the volcano, there was no lava to be found in its close vicinity.<br>When they arrived, Song Yun was already standing at the edge of the volcano. It was not that she didn&rsquo;t want to proceed any deeper but she was unable to.<br>There was a formation in the depth of the volcano, and it was this very formation that was causing lava to spill out. However, the formation was located at the heart of the volcano, and it was protected by a transparent barrier.<br>It was due to the barrier that Song Yun was unable to advance any further.<br>Through the transparent barrier, they could see that a middle-aged man was sitting inside the formation. He looked fairly suave with long hair cascading down his shoulder. He was dressed in neat clothes.<br>However, there was a gray tail extending out of his robe, and there was a pair of wolf-like ears above his head.<br>He was not a human but a monstrous beast, possibly the Monstrous King.<br>The formation he was sitting in had already lost its energy, leaving behind nothing but its form. Nevertheless, it was apparent that it was an extremely delicate formation.<br>&ldquo;He has lost all signs of life. Even though his soul is still intact, he no longer possesses consciousness. All that&rsquo;s left is just a bundle of soul power,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you managed to make a breakthrough! That&rsquo;s incredible!&rdquo;<br>Song Yun was overjoyed when she noticed the rank four Martial Exalted level cultivation coming from Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re also an incredible one too. To think that you&rsquo;ve already reached rank one Martial Exalted level,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still lacking compared to you, big brother Chu Feng,&rdquo; Song Yun said.<br>&ldquo;Did your mother tell you anything about this volcano?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He was checking if Song Yun had anything reminiscent of a clue on her.<br>&ldquo;Nothing at all. She only gave me that pearl,&rdquo; Song Yun replied.<br>&ldquo;I see&hellip; It&rsquo;s alright. Based on what I&rsquo;m seeing, we should be able to get to the soul power as long as we&rsquo;re able to break the barrier. It&rsquo;s just that&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words trailed off.<br>&ldquo;What is it, big brother Chu Feng?&rdquo; Song Yun asked.<br>Chu Feng glanced at Song Yun and Wang Yuxian with an apologetic look on his face, but he chose to speak up in the end.<br>&ldquo;Song Yun, Lele, I&rsquo;ll get straight to the point since there are no outsiders here. Zi Ling is severely injured, and she needs soul power to treat her affliction. The soul power left behind by the Monstrous King is a good opportunity for her.<br>&ldquo;So, I hope to give all of the soul power to Zi Ling. I know that it&rsquo;s a selfish request, but I&rsquo;ll do my best to make it up to you in the future,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a lowered head.<br>He was aware that the request he was making was overboard, but he couldn&rsquo;t allow anything to happen to Zi Ling.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re being too distant. If not for you, we wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to come this far. You can say that we owe you our lives. Besides, I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;d have the capability to obtain the soul power, and I don&rsquo;t have much use of it anyway. You can take it if you need it; there&rsquo;s no need to feel embarrassed,&rdquo; Wang Yuxian said.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, is big sister Zi Ling very ill?&rdquo; Song Yun asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very serious,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m also very ill as well. Big brother Chu Feng, you know that too, right? It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want to help big sister Zi Ling, but I need this soul power to save my life too,&rdquo; Song Yun said with an indignant look on her face.<br></p></div>
