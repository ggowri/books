        <div> - The Appointment<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that Chu Feng was so excited, Grandmaster Liangqiu spoke again. &ldquo;World spiritists are capable of healing injuries, casting weapons, setting up spirit formations that martial cultivators are unable to create, and even establishing isolated spaces and remnants. Their abilities reach the heavens. They are simply omnipotent. If there are gods in this world, then, based on the abilities that world spiritists possess, they are gods in the eyes of the people.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, although world spiritists possess a lot of tricks, their battle power is simply too low. That is also the reason why there are a lot of people that are gifted in learning world spirit techniques, but decide to not bother spending any effort nurturing their talent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, after reaching Saint-cloak, a world spiritist&rsquo;s battle power will finally begin to rise.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists are comparable to rank one Exalted. Although it will depend on the world spiritist&rsquo;s own capabilities as to whether or not they&rsquo;ll really be able to defeat a rank one Exalted, they will be completely unmatched beneath the Exalted realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Upon reaching Snake Mark Saint-cloak, one&rsquo;s battle power will increase again, matching rank five Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for this old man, I&rsquo;ve stepped into Dragon Mark Saint-cloak now. I am able to sense that my spirit power&rsquo;s battle power has increased again.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes became incomparably bright. He stared at Grandmaster Liangqiu with a look of expectation. He was waiting for Grandmaster Liangqiu to reveal his battle power.<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s expectant look, Grandmaster Liangqiu did not keep him in suspense, and directly said, &ldquo;It is now comparable to a rank one Utmost Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sssss~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng sucked in a mouthful of cold air upon hearing those words. Then, he said, &ldquo;Never would I have imagined that world spirit techniques would possess such power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, what about God-cloak? Grandmaster, do God-cloak World Spiritists really possess power capable of utter destruction that could rip apart worlds?&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly asked.<br>&ldquo;I think that God-cloak World Spiritists should be capable of such a feat.&rdquo;<br>Then, Grandmaster Liangqiu began to tell Chu Feng all he knew about world spiritists, including matters regarding True Dragon-level world spiritists that he had learned from Grandmaster Long Xuan.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that there&rsquo;s actually an even more powerful realm above God-cloak.&rdquo;<br>Although Grandmaster Liangqiu explicitly stated to Chu Feng that the matter regarding True Dragon-level world spiritists was something that he had learned from Grandmaster Long Xuan, and he could not verify its validity, a deep sense of yearning had emerged in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Suddenly, Grandmaster Liangqiu started to cough violently.<br>He was coughing so violently that it seemed like every cough caused him to become weaker.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster,&rdquo; Seeing that, Chu Feng became extremely worried. At the same time, he felt very ashamed.<br>If he hadn&rsquo;t helped him remove the seal, Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s situation wouldn&rsquo;t be so severe.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu waved his hand. Then, after stabilizing his coughing, he looked to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Young friend, do you still have that Nine Dragons Saint Cloak?&rdquo;<br>The reason why Grandmaster Liangqiu asked such a question was because the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak had landed on Chu Feng of its own accord, making him extremely dazzling.<br>Yet, at that moment, there was no trace of it.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu had also learned of what had happened to Chu Feng from Liangqiu Chengfeng. He knew that it was all due to the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak that Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t respond to them, and had suddenly disappeared.<br>Because of that, Grandmaster Liangqiu became aware of how powerful the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was. It seemed that&hellip; the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak&rsquo;s power was even stronger than the current him.<br>That said, Grandmaster Liangqiu didn&rsquo;t know where the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak had gone off to.<br>&ldquo;I do not know if the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak is still on me or not. Senior, truth be told&hellip; I am able to faintly sense the aura of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak. However, that sensation is extremely faint, and I am unable to detect anything on me. Even the aura of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak that I feel comea from the surroundings, and not from my body,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak is an object with consciousness. That&rsquo;s quite normal too. After all, secret skills and even Imperial Armaments possess consciousnesses, how could a world spiritist saint cloak constructed by the World Spiritist Immortal King not possess a consciousness?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it. I think that the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak is still with you. Likely, because its powers are too strong, you must possess a certain amount of power in order to use it. When that time comes, it will most likely reveal itself,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu said.<br>&ldquo;What Grandmaster says is very correct,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I actually have another matter that I still don&rsquo;t have an answer to. Might young friend Chu Feng be willing to give this old man an answer now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man is sincerely hoping to take you as my disciple. Young friend Chu Feng, what do you think&hellip;&rdquo; After saying those words, Grandmaster Liangqiu, who had always remained calm and unflustered, actually had a slightly nervous expression in his eyes as he looked to Chu Feng.<br>From such a reaction, one could well imagine how nervous he was felt deep in his heart.<br>After all, to him, Chu Feng was not only a disciple that could make up for his life&rsquo;s regret, but he was also a hope, a disciple that he felt to be capable of reaching peaks that he could not.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, I&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng did not answer Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s question directly. However, he revealed a very difficult expression.<br>&ldquo;This old man already knows young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s answer. Merely, this old man wanted to know why you are unwilling to take a master. Could it be that&hellip; you already have a master?&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu asked.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this junior had once vowed never to take another master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Throughout my journey, there have been a lot of expert seniors that have wanted to take me as their disciple. However, because of my vow, I have rejected all of them,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Is there anyone with world spirit techniques surpassing my own amongst them?&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu asked.<br>&ldquo;In terms of both strength and status, Grandmaster Liangqiu, you are the strongest. But&hellip; this junior didn&rsquo;t reject those seniors because of their strength. I rejected those seniors in the past. If I am to agree to become senior&rsquo;s disciple today, then, ignoring what those seniors might think, I myself will feel very guilty,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, you&rsquo;ve also met Linghu Hongfei. Although that child appears to be very righteous, he is actually ruthless and cunning. Truth be told, it was them who spread the prophecy of the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Their intention was to consolidate Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s reputation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, you have seized Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s glory. He will definitely be unwilling to leave things at that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although this old man is not strong enough to contend against the Linghu Heavenly Clan, I have connections. If you become this old man&rsquo;s disciple, whilst I do not dare to say that I will help you fight the Linghu Heavenly Clan, I can guarantee that you will be safe from them,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, thank you for your kind intentions, merely&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend, don&rsquo;t be in such a rush to refuse just yet. Consider things properly. As long as you&rsquo;re willing to become my disciple, not only will I impart all of my abilities to you, but I am also willing to impart all of my treasures when you graduate from disciplehood under me,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu said.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, I am truly&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had wanted to refuse, but Grandmaster Liangqiu suddenly spoke, &ldquo;Young friend, please think it over.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Grandmaster Liangqiu began to cough violently again.<br>Seeing Grandmaster Liangqiu coughing like that, Chu Feng found it unsuitable to continue to refuse. Although he knew very well what his decision was, knew very well that he wouldn&rsquo;t take a master, he could only say, &ldquo;Okay, Grandmaster, I will properly think things over.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Cough, cough&hellip; good, this old man will wait for your response,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu was still coughing violently. However, his mood had clearly become much better.<br>Then, Chu Feng and Grandmaster Liangqiu chatted for a while. After that, Grandmaster Liangqiu continued treating the injuries caused by his backlash, whereas Chu Feng walked out from the healing formation to find Wuma Shengjie and the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Upon learning that Chu Feng&rsquo;s seal was removed, Wuma Shengjie and the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief both heaved a sigh of relief.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, in that case, are you going to participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars?&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very good, that is the decision that this old man was waiting for,&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was even more joyous than Chu Feng upon hearing his answer.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still some time before the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars. Where are you all planning to go to now?&rdquo; Liangqiu Chengfeng asked.<br>Both Wuma Shengjie and the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief turned their eyes to Chu Feng. Evidently, they were waiting for his decision.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find my big sister Liluo to see how she&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well, this old man will bring you all to the Tantai Heavenly Clan for the appointment,&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br></p></div>
