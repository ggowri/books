        <div><span>: One of the Strongest Existences in the Ancient Era</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>Despite having lost the black crystal, neither Li Wu nor Feng Ling showed any intention of taking it back. Fear covered their faces.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big sister.&rdquo; Feng Ling&rsquo;s lips were quivering as she looked at Li Wu. &ldquo;Is our lord really still alive?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;That didn&rsquo;t seem like a formation. Our lord might really still be alive,&rdquo; Li Wu replied with a frown.</span><br><span>Feng Ling nearly collapsed to the ground.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We plundered our lord&rsquo;s treasure when our lord was still alive. Will she kill us?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked worriedly.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We would have already been dead if our lord wished to take our lives,&rdquo; Li Wu replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It could be that the black crystal is just a transmission tool, and that our lord isn&rsquo;t here at all. Otherwise, there&rsquo;s no way she would have spared us. She wouldn&rsquo;t have permitted us </span><span>to covet her treasures,&rdquo; Feng Ling said.</span><br><span>Despite her fragmented memories, she still remembered their master to be a vicious person.</span><br><span>Li Wu chuckled at those words and said, &ldquo;Feng Ling, you&rsquo;re underestimating our lord. Even if the black crystal was just a medium of communication, the fact that she was able to see us through it means that she could have also killed us through it too.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Does this mean that&hellip; we&rsquo;re free?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo; Li Wu shook her head.</span><br><span>Feng Ling&rsquo;s complexion grew heavy. She was still worried even though their master had said that they weren&rsquo;t her subordinates anymore. Tens of thousands of years had already passed since then, but their master&rsquo;s terrifying might was still deeply imprinted in her soul.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Li Wu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That black crystal was headed in Chu Feng&rsquo;s direction. Big sister, do you think that he&rsquo;ll be able to withstand its powers?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a question I should be asking you. You should know him better than me,&rdquo; Li Wu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng is indeed talented, but the world inside the black crystal is simply too terrifying&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know whether Chu Feng will be able to withstand it or not,&rdquo; Feng Ling said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think too much about it. It&rsquo;ll be best for us to steer clear of our master&rsquo;s affairs,&rdquo; Li Wu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ah&hellip; Th-that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Feng Ling nodded, but her face remained awfully pale.</span><br><span>Li Wu patted Feng Ling&rsquo;s head and consoled her, saying, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to get so worried. Our master would have already killed us if she intended to do so. Since she has chosen to show us mercy, it could only mean that she doesn&rsquo;t blame us. Besides, it&rsquo;s a good thing that our master is still alive; that&rsquo;s the greatest backing we can ever dream of.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I understand, but I&rsquo;m still afraid,&rdquo; Feng Ling replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only normal for you to be afraid. Even the powerhouses of the Ancient Era fear our master!&rdquo; Li Wu said.</span><br><span>Feng Ling nodded in agreement. After all, their master was one of the strongest existences in the Ancient Era.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Speaking of which, how was the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith? The tournament should be over now that you&rsquo;re back, but it&rsquo;s weird that the results haven&rsquo;t been announced yet,&rdquo; Li Wu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It was postponed,&rdquo; Feng Ling replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Postponed? Why?&rdquo; Li Wu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Master Nine Zenith said that there are people missing from the invitation list this time around, and that would undermine the credibility of the tournament. Thus, he declared that it would be postponed for the time being,&rdquo; Feng Ling said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I see. Did you meet the other juniors?&rdquo; Li Wu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I did. One of them even followed me here, only to get stuck by our master&rsquo;s remnant.&rdquo; Feng Ling chuckled under her breath.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How are they? Is there anyone stronger than you?&rdquo; Li Wu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just a bunch of entitled kids who have benefited from the shade of the big trees behind them. However, there&rsquo;s one guy from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan who might be a threat to me. I was unable to see through him,&rdquo; Feng Ling said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Xianhai Shaoyu?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s him. He didn&rsquo;t cross blows with anyone, but I can sense that he&rsquo;s very powerful.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you think that you can defeat him?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d naturally be able to beat him if we&rsquo;re at the same cultivation level, but the thing is that I don&rsquo;t know what his current cultivation level is,&rdquo; Feng Ling replied confidently.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like the Feng Ling I know. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Li Wu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Mm!&rdquo; Feng Ling nodded.</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng was still trying to chase after Li Wu. Through the item he had received from Li Wu, he realized that she wasn&rsquo;t cursed by the Black-feathered Specter. Rather, she was the Black-feathered Specter herself.</span><br><span>That being said, he didn&rsquo;t think that Li Wu was a bad person based on his interactions with her thus far, which was why he wanted to find out more about her. It was a pity that he was unable to find her despite his best effort.</span><br><span>Shoosh!</span><br><span>A flash of black light suddenly rushed in his direction.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why is this item here?&rdquo; Taking a closer look, Chu Feng realized that it was the black crystal Feng Ling had stolen from him.</span><br><span>Just then, the black crystal released a powerful suction force that drew him in.</span><br><span>The next moment, Chu Feng found himself standing in the middle of vast space. There was light in his surroundings, but it came not from other realms but little specks of blue light.</span><br><span>The larger specks floated alone, whereas the smaller specks lined up to form little snakes and swiftly bolted around the realm. Each of these blue specks had a rune on them, suggesting that they carried something. All of them were revolving around an incomparably huge bundle of blue light.</span><br><span>Sitting in the middle of the bundle of blue light was the black crystal that had dragged Chu Feng in here, just that it was many times larger. Granted that it was still smaller than the bundle of blue light, but it still easily spanned the size of thousands of realms stuck together.</span><br><span>What truly unnerved Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t the colossal bundle of blue light but the black crystal.</span><br><span>There were countless chains on the colossal bundle of blue light, each of them plastered with a humongous talisman containing a powerful sealing formation. The chains and the talismans formed a complete set to seal off the bundle of blue light and the black crystal.</span><br><span>As a world spiritist, Chu Feng could sense just how powerful these seals were. Even a single one of these seals had more than enough power to obliterate him from the face of the world. It made him shudder just to imagine how powerful the black crystal was.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng sensed a gaze, which prompted him to turn around. There was a bundle of red aura behind him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, we have met again,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a chuckle.</span><br><span>While this bundle of red aura was only around ten meters in diameter, he immediately knew that this was the remnant&rsquo;s master. He was initially flustered by the situation, but the appearance of the red aura calmed him down. He sensed that the remnant&rsquo;s master was even stronger than the black crystal, such that the latter didn&rsquo;t seem that scary anymore.</span><br></p></div>
