        <h1>Chapter 5144</h1>
        <div>: White-robed Young Man<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You may check whether the sum is right.&rdquo;<br>Lord Tiger took a puff of smoke while tossing a Cosmos Sack to City Lord Liang.<br>&ldquo;Lord Tiger, the sum is right,&rdquo; City Lord Liang took a quick look at the Cosmos Sack and replied.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;<br>Lord Tiger took the map with another hand&mdash;or to be more exact, a cat claw. He took a glance at the map and asked, &ldquo;City Lord Liang, did you sell this piece of information to anyone else?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Tiger, I pride myself on my sincerity, so I shan&rsquo;t deceive you. I was intending to sell this piece of information to you only. After all, this matter concerns the Situ World Spiritist Clan. My head will roll if things go wrong. However, my benefactor happened to ask me about this matter, so I gave them this piece of information too,&rdquo; City Lord Liang replied.<br>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that mean that I&rsquo;ll have another competitor? What&rsquo;s the background of your benefactor?&rdquo; Lord Tiger asked.<br>&ldquo;I apologize, Lord Tiger, but I can&rsquo;t divulge that to you,&rdquo; City Lord Liang replied.<br>&ldquo;Does your benefactor know that I was here?&rdquo; Lord Tiger asked.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, Lord Tiger. You&rsquo;re my esteemed customer, so I wouldn&rsquo;t sell your information to anyone, not even to my benefactor,&rdquo; City Lord Liang replied.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like it. Alright, I&rsquo;ll be leaving now. See you next time. If I get something good out of this, I&rsquo;ll split a portion of it with you.&rdquo;<br>With a wave of his hand, Lord Tiger rose to his feet.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Tiger.&rdquo;<br>City Lord Liang also stood up to send his guest off. It could be seen from his attitude that both of them were on fairly good terms.<br>&hellip;<br>Chu Feng continued advancing according to the map. In order not to attract attention, he used a powerful concealment formation together with the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak&rsquo;s concealment ability.<br>Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power had been growing stronger, he found that the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak&rsquo;s concealment ability wasn&rsquo;t weakening in the least. Instead, it was growing more powerful along with him.<br>Due to that, the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak&rsquo;s concealment ability remained powerful.<br>With this double layer of concealment, even a God-cloak World Spiritist would struggle to find him.<br>Soon, Chu Feng and Song Yuwei arrived at the area indicated by the map. It was a barren mountain range with hardly anyone in sight. No one would have thought that the ancient remnant was at a place like this.<br>In fact, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t find anything amiss when he first arrived here. It was only through Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes that he detected the presence of a disguise formation.<br>The disguise formation had been here for quite some years, which suggested that it wasn&rsquo;t the doing of the Situ World Spiritist Clan but the legendary world spiritist. If Chu Feng wanted to unravel the disguise formation, he could have done so even though it would take some time.<br>However, he knew that the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen were likely in there. He would surely alarm them if he started constructing a formation out here.<br>While he knew that the grand elder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan was weaker than the Asura King, such that he could go on an all-out massacre right away, but through the conversations he had with Song Yuwei along the way, he realized just how powerful the legendary world spiritist was.<br>The legendary world spiritist didn&rsquo;t just receive an invitation from the Totem Dragon Clan but the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion too. This showed just how formidable of an existence he was.<br>What was surprising was that the legendary world spiritist actually rejected the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s invitation but instead focused his efforts on supporting the Totem Dragon Clan.<br>Cultivators weren&rsquo;t good at exploring ancient remnants due to their limited utility. Instead, it was world spiritists who played a bigger role there.<br>The Totem Dragon Clan was a behemoth with many powerful cultivators under its command, but in terms of world spiritists, it was sorely lacking compared to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. This left it with no choice but to collaborate with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion whenever they discovered a new ancient remnant, which meant that they had to share a portion of the profits with them.<br>If only they had powerful world spiritists of their own, they wouldn&rsquo;t have to share the spoils with an outsider.<br>That was why the legendary world spiritist was highly regarded by the Totem Dragon Clan. He was a truly powerful world spiritist, likely to be a True Dragon World Spiritist. That would put him on par with True God level cultivators.<br>That made Chu Feng interested in the ancient remnant too.<br>It was unlikely that the ancient remnant would suddenly appear out of nowhere after so many years, so he deduced that the Situ World Spiritist Clan must have discovered something. It was not surprising since the Situ World Spiritist Clan was known to specialize in world spiritist techniques.<br>In view of that, Chu Feng decided to bide his time and only make a move when the time is ripe.<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything special about this place at all. Is City Lord Liang&rsquo;s information off the mark?&rdquo; Song Yuwei asked.<br>She had also been scanning their surroundings but she couldn&rsquo;t find anything at all.<br>&ldquo;Elder Yuwei, City Lord Liang&rsquo;s information is on the mark. There&rsquo;s indeed an ancient remnant here, just that it&rsquo;s hidden by a formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Ah? I don&rsquo;t see anything though.&rdquo;<br>Nevertheless, Song Yuwei was glad to hear that they hadn&rsquo;t made this trip in vain.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, are we able to enter the remnant?&rdquo; Song Yuwei asked.<br>&ldquo;I am confident of deciphering the formation, but I don&rsquo;t want to risk alarming the Situ World Spiritist Clan. I&rsquo;m trying to see if it&rsquo;s possible for us to get throughthe formation without destroying it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He took out the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk, which was one of the ten treasures of the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect. It had the ability to protect its master, break formations, infiltrate areas, and rob fortuitous encounters.<br>When it came to exploring ancient remnants, the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk was indubitably a powerful tool that allowed him to leap ahead of his rivals. It was just that it had a mind of its own. There were times that it had helped Chu Feng, but there were also times it had left him to the lurch.<br>The Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk was not fully under his control.<br>Fortunately, it chose to help him this time around. It offered him a tip, pointing out an entrance in the formation. They would be able to get through the formation by entering through the entrance.<br>However, before the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk offered its guidance, Chu Feng had carefully scanned the entire formation but couldn&rsquo;t find the entrance. Once again, the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk had proven its strength.<br>&ldquo;My darling treasure, you need to keep this up. I&rsquo;m counting on you here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, did you find an opening?&rdquo; Song Yuwei asked.<br>&ldquo;Mmhm. We can head in now,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re truly incredible.&rdquo;<br>Song Yuwei was earnestly impressed by how quickly Chu Feng was able to find an opening in the formation. She wasn&rsquo;t even able to sense the formation at all, let alone find its opening. She had no choice but to count on Chu Feng here.<br>One must know Chu Feng was a junior who wasn&rsquo;t even a hundred years old yet. Even Song Luoyi, the most talented prodigy she had seen thus far, paled in comparison to him.<br>&ldquo;Elder, you&rsquo;re flattering me. It&rsquo;s all thanks to this treasure,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with an awkward laugh.<br>He knew that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do this himself if not for the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk. All of a sudden, he froze up.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Song Yuwei asked.<br>&ldquo;I sense someone observing this area too,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>He activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes and started scanning the surroundings once more. He suddenly had a feeling that someone else was scanning the area. The other party was likely to be hiding as well, and he was planning to root that person out.<br>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes widened in astonishment.<br>A suave, white-robed young man with an air of loftiness suddenly appeared before them.<br>&ldquo;Is it him?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng carefully examined the white-robed young man, but he was unable to confirm whether the white-robed young man was the person who had been observing this area earlier on.<br>All of a sudden, the white-robed young man raised his palm and struck it downward. The world trembled under the force of his palm.<br>Song Yuwei quickly dashed in front of Chu Feng to protect him, for she could tell that the palm harnessed the might of a Half-God level cultivator!<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a junior too, but he has already reached Half-God level?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t sustain any injuries, but he couldn&rsquo;t help but have complicated feelings about the current situation. He could tell that the white-robed young man was a junior just like him.<br>One must know that Chu Feng was already the strongest junior in the Eastern Region, but there was still a huge gap for him to bridge before he could reach Half-God level. Yet, the white-robed young man in front of him was already at Half-God level.<br>It was hard for him not to be affected by this.<br></p></div>
