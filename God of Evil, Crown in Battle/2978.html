        <h1>Chapter 2977</h1>
        <div> - Flame Extinguishing Pearl<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to Lord Supreme Elder.&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing who it was that had arrived, the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan, including even Chu Xuanzhengfa, all clasped their fists to greet the old man respectfully.<br>Seeing that old man, Chu Feng knew who he was without needing others to introduce him. That old man was not only an Supreme Elder of the Chu Heavenly Clan, but he also possessed another identity.<br>He was most definitely Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather.<br>The reason for that was because the two of them resembled one another. This was especially true of their disgusting condescending eyes. Those eyes were simply produced from the same mold.<br>Right at that moment, a person of the older generation ordered Chu Feng with a stern voice, &ldquo;Chu Feng, that person is one of our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s seven Supreme Elders, Lord Puze.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Quickly, greet him respectfully.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was not someone without social etiquette. Even though the old man had come with ill-intentions, it remained that the old man was his senior. As such, Chu Feng clasped his fist and bowed respectfully.<br>&ldquo;Lord Puze, could it be that something has happened?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.<br>&ldquo;Youyuan, you explain this matter to them,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather waved his hand.<br>Right at that moment, a person suddenly soared from the crowd and arrived in the sky.<br>That person was also an old man. Furthermore, that old man possessed a very powerful cultivation. He was an Exalted-level expert. Chu Feng was able to tell that he was stronger than Chu Xuanzhengfa, and not weaker than Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather.<br>That old man was an Supreme Elder-level expert.<br>Likely, he was a rank two Exalted.<br>That said, the old man&rsquo;s appearance was somewhat inconsistent with his strength.<br>The old man had a slouching stance. In his hand was a walking stick. He seemed as if he would not be able to stand firm without that walking stick.<br>That said, that walking stick was very crude. It resembled a wooden stick picked up from the ground. Even through careful observation, Chu Feng was unable to find anything particularly good about it.<br>As for that old man&rsquo;s outfit, it was also very plain and simple. He was wearing an ordinary sackcloth gown. Most importantly, his sackcloth gown was filled with patches. It was as if he had worn it for many years. From a glance, it resembled the outfit of a beggar.<br>That said, one thing worthy of mentioning was that the sackcloth gown, although very worn out, was very clean. It could be said to be untainted by even a speck of dust.<br>Most importantly, the old man had a very benevolent-looking face. He seemed to be very amiable.<br>Compared to Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather&rsquo;s fierce face, that old man was simply amiable and approachable to the extreme. He gave off a very pleasant sensation.<br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to Lord Youyuan.&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing that old man, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others from the Chu Heavenly Clan all greeted him respectfully as well.<br>It could be seen that the old man was also someone of extraordinary status. However, he should not be an Supreme Elder. Instead, he should possess some special status.<br>This time around, Chu Feng also clasped his fist at that old man respectfully without anyone reminding him to do so.<br>&ldquo;Cough cough,&rdquo; that Lord Youyuan first coughed twice. Then, he waved his hand and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said it many times already, there&rsquo;s no need to greet me like this. We are all family, there is no need for this level of courtesy.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, that Lord Youyuan laughed. Then, he continued, &ldquo;I have returned from the Nine Moons Sacred Domain with relatively important news.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As everyone knows, the Nine Moons Sacred Domain is soon to open. It has been determined that the Nine Moons Sacred Domain will open in three days' time,&rdquo; Lord Youyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Three days&rsquo; time? That fast?&rdquo; Hearing those words, many of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations became very excited.<br>The reason for that was because they had all passed the Sacred Domain Selection, and were thus qualified to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain to train there.<br>Entering the Nine Moons Sacred Domain would bring them enormous benefits.<br>&ldquo;However, the Nine Moons Sacred Domain this time around is filled with Blueflame Biogas.The Blueflame Biogas has spread through the entire Nine Moons Sacred Domain, covering it completely,&rdquo; Lord Youyuan said.<br>&ldquo;What? Blueflame Biogas?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; this is truly too unfortunate.&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing the words &lsquo;Blueflame Biogas&rsquo;, those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations that were feeling excited earlier immediately became dejected and displeased.<br>At that moment, sighs began to be heard from those members of the younger generations that passed the Sacred Domain Selection. Even Chu Yue had a depressed look on her face. It was as if she had received an enormous shock.<br>&ldquo;Big sis Chu Yue, what is that Blueflame Biogas?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Chu Yue.<br>Chu Yue sighed. &ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, you do not know about this. The Blueflame Biogas is a special gaseous substance of the Nine Moons Sacred Domain. It possesses a certain level of toxicity. While it will not cause any harm to Heavenly Immortal-level experts, it is extremely corrosive for cultivators beneath the Heavenly Immortal realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Blueflame Biogas is capable of invading one&rsquo;s soul. Once one&rsquo;s soul is invaded, it will be burned by the Blueflame Biogas. One will then end up burning to death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, whenever the Blueflame Biogas appears, we of the younger generations cannot enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain,&rdquo; Chu Yue said with a depressed expression on her face.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng finally understood why those people of the younger generation were all acting so depressed.<br>It turned out that they would not be able to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain since this Blueflame Biogas had appeared.<br>&ldquo;However, you of the younger generations present need not be too discouraged. Our clan has always been thinking of a way to deal with the Blueflame Biogas. And now&hellip; we already possess a treasure to take on the Blueflame Biogas.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This treasure is capable of effectively guarding against Blueflame Biogas,&rdquo; right at that moment, Lord Youyuan opened his palm. Immediately, countless bodies of light dispersed from his palm.<br>Those bodies of light were blue in color, and had the size of fireflies. As they floated in midair, they seemed to possess life.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that those bodies of light were extremely remarkable.<br>&ldquo;These here are what our clan has researched for many years to specially take on the Blueflame Biogas. They are called Flame Extinguishing Pearls. With a Flame Extinguishing Pearl on your body, the Blueflame Biogas will not be able to approach you,&rdquo; Lord Youyuan said.<br>&ldquo;This is great! This would mean that we are able to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain to train!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about these Flame Extinguishing Pearls before. Never would I have expected that we actually managed to develop them successfully. Truly, the heavens are helping us. Even the heavens want us to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations that were sighing in depression earlier were immediately overjoyed. They were all cheering gleefully.<br>&ldquo;However, the Flame Extinguishing Pearls must be awakened first in order to be of use. Furthermore, only those below the Heavenly Immortal realm will be able to awaken them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There is also a certain requirement in order to awaken a Flame Extinguishing Pearl. The way I see it, all of you here might not necessarily be able to awaken them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I have already consulted with the Supreme Elders. We decided to change the rules for entering the Nine Moons Sacred Domain on this occasion.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are a total of sixty Flame Extinguishing Pearls here. If anyone is capable of awakening them, they will then be qualified to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain to train.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, if you are able to awaken a Flame Extinguishment Pearl and don&rsquo;t want to enter, you can pass it on to someone else.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for those people of the younger generation that have already obtained the qualifications to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain, they will be entitled to attempt to awaken the Flame Extinguishing Pearls first. If you all fail to awaken them, then, because of your efforts earlier, we will make an exception and allow you all to find others to help you awaken them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I must remind all you younger generations here, that each of you&hellip; can only awaken a single Flame Extinguishing Pearl,&rdquo; Lord Youyuan said to the people of the younger generation present.<br><br><br></p></div>
