        <div>: Exile?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his cultivation level?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what his cultivation level is; I only know that he&rsquo;s no ordinary figure. The sectmaster has high expectations of him. She&rsquo;s intending to groom him as the next sectmaster,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said.<br>&ldquo;Next sectmaster?&rdquo;<br>The current generation of juniors in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was dubbed to be the most talented one, but the sectmaster was actually intending to pass down her position to a person who had appeared out of nowhere.<br>This definitely showed just how formidable of a person the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple was.<br>&ldquo;Brother Duan, I understand what you mean. I&rsquo;m prepared for that,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;I know that dignity is important to a man, but it&rsquo;s never too late to exact vengeance. Even if you aren&rsquo;t his opponent now, you&rsquo;ll surely surpass him eventually given your talents. A man should learn to be flexible.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, I know that you&rsquo;re a strong person on the inside, so I trust that you&rsquo;ll be able to accept the result, be it a win or a loss. Alright, you should head in and rest now. Make sure that you&rsquo;re in tip-top condition for the battle tomorrow, alright?&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said.<br>Chu Feng nodded quietly before heading in.<br>Needless to say, he wouldn&rsquo;t really go to rest. He was still feeling indignant about his failure, so he wanted to continue trying to decipher the final seal of the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor.<br>Since the supporting formation couldn&rsquo;t help him, he could only depend on himself.<br>Shoosh!<br>All of a sudden, Chu Feng felt a terrifying pressure crushing down on him. Time seemed to have stopped at the very instant, or to be more exact, everything around him had frozen in place.<br>Chu Feng sensed that the people standing outside him were held in place by some sort of powerful energy. Only the area around Chu Feng&rsquo;s residence was fine.<br>This anomaly was coming from the direction where Duan Liufeng was.<br>Chu Feng hurriedly turned around to take a look, only to see that another person had appeared beside Duan Liufeng. It was a dignified woman with a transcendental disposition. She had a presence that suffocated others that stood before her.<br>It felt like she had already transcended mortal boundaries to become a god.<br>Needless to say, this person was the strongest person in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, the sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Disciple Chu Feng pays respects to Lord Sectmaster,&rdquo; Chu Feng bowed deeply and said.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t the type of person to bootlick, but as a disciple, it was only right for him to accord respect to the sectmaster. Even if for Zi Ling&rsquo;s sake, he ought to lower his head to the sectmaster for the time being.<br>However, the sectmaster didn&rsquo;t respond to Chu Feng&rsquo;s greeting. Instead, she kept her eyes fixated on Duan Liufeng, seemingly having come for him.<br>&ldquo;&rdquo;Who allowed you to use my supporting formation?&rdquo; the sectmaster asked.<br>Those words were directed at Duan Liufeng, but her gaze also stopped momentarily on Chu Feng as well. Just her cold eyes were enough to leave goosebumps on Chu Feng&rsquo;s arms.<br>Those words exposed the lie that Duan Liufeng had spoken earlier. It turned out that he hadn&rsquo;t received the sectmaster&rsquo;s approval to use her supporting formation.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, this was my idea. It has nothing to do with Chu Feng,&rdquo; Duan Liufeng said.<br>&ldquo;I know that it was your idea. Duan Liufeng, have I accorded you so much power that you have forgotten your place? Kneel down,&rdquo; the sectmaster bellowed.<br>The surroundings seemed to have suddenly trembled, and Chu Feng felt like his body was going to explode. At the same time, Duan Liufeng also immediately kneeled down.<br>This was the first time Chu Feng had seen Duan Liufeng fearing a person so much.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng wanted to explain the matter, but Duan Liufeng stopped him with a roar.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng!!!&rdquo;<br>He was warning Chu Feng not to say anything at all. However, it was too late. The sectmaster had already turned her sights toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, for using my supporting formation without seeking my permission, I&rsquo;ll be expeling you from my Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Get out of my sight right now!&rdquo;<br>The sectmaster waved her hand, and Chu Feng felt a suction force pulling him in.<br>Shit.<br>Chu Feng felt that it was all over in this very instant. It was going to be the matchmaking convention tomorrow, and if he were to be evicted right now, it would mean that Zi Ling would really be betrothed to another man.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, this has nothing to do with Chu Feng. I was the one who deceived him saying that I&rsquo;ve received your permission. That&rsquo;s why he dared to use your supporting formation! I know that I&rsquo;ve made a grievous mistake, and I&rsquo;m willing to serve the sect a thousand years without asking for any compensation. I ask you not to punish Chu Feng for this!&rdquo;<br>Duan Liufeng quickly begged on Chu Feng&rsquo;s behalf.<br>&ldquo;No compensation for a thousand years? Do you think that&rsquo;s enough? Your crime is not something that can be acquitted just by asking for no compensation! I&rsquo;ll deal with you after I evict this brat out of here!&rdquo;<br>The sectmaster began to make a move, seemingly determined to expel Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, do you intend to go this far just because I&rsquo;ve broken Lord Dugu Lingtian&rsquo;s records? Don&rsquo;t you think that you&rsquo;re letting down the founder of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect here?&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly spoke up.<br>He had changed his attitude entirely, such that his tone had become sharp and contemptuous.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t speak nonsense!&rdquo;<br>Duan Liufeng immediately tried to stop Chu Feng.<br>However, the sectmaster had clearly heard Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, and she directed her furious gaze upon Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What did you just say? Are you saying that I'm picking on you because you have broken Dugu Lingtian&rsquo;s records?&rdquo;<br>The sectmaster looked at Chu Feng with eyes as sharp as razor blades. The intensity of her gaze was so pressurizing that anyone else wouldn;t have been able to stand it. She was intentionally trying to suppress Chu Feng here.<br>Even Chu Feng felt his body weakening before her suppression, but he still held his ground in the end.<br>&ldquo;Is there anything wrong with what I&rsquo;ve said? You might be the high and mighty sectmaster, but the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect is the legacy of the sect founder. Cultivation resources ought to be granted to the disciples and the elders so that they can advance their cultivation.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s indeed wrong of me to use your supporting formation without permission, but my intent is to raise my cultivation so as to bring glory to the sect. I&rsquo;d understand getting punished for the violation of procedures, but expelling me from the sect is clearly going too far. I can&rsquo;t see this as anything else but you picking on me for your selfish desires,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Selfish desires? You sure dare to speak! Who do you think you are? Do you think that you can surpass Dugu Lingtian just because you broke a few records? Do you know how much he has contributed to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect? As for you&hellip; other than benefiting off our sect to raise your cultivation, have you contributed anything back at all?&rdquo; the sectmaster said.<br></p></div>
