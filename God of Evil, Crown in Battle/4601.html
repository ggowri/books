        <h1>Chapter 4600</h1>
        <div>: Bloodline Dimension<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both Chu Feng and Yin Tianchou were determined to win this battle, for they knew that the fate that awaited the loser was death!<br>Despite having brought out treasures that enhanced their spirit power, they were still a close match to one another. They were no longer holding back anymore, yet the duel still remained as intense as before.<br>Time slowly ticked by, and soon, the duo had nearly been fighting for a day now. If they were still unable to decide on a victor by then, it would surely end as a draw.<br>They would be teleported out of the Incubation Forest by the effects of the formation, after all.<br>This made Chu Feng a little anxious. He entered the forest in order to find the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl for Song Yun, and if things continued to drag on, the opportunity would slip through his fingers.<br>However, Yin Tianchou was truly powerful.<br>In a battle against world spiritists of similar age groups, there had never been anyone who could put so much pressure on him as Yin Tianchou. Defeating Yin Tianchou was definitely not easy at all.<br>Shoosh!<br>While Chu Feng was still wondering how he should defeat Yin Tianchou, the latter suddenly did something shocking. He tossed the silver bowl in his hand into the sky.<br>As soon as the silver bowl left his grip, it immediately grew larger, expanding to a diameter exceeding ten thousand meters, covering both Chu Feng and Yin Tianchou.<br>&ldquo;This feeling&hellip; Something is wrong here!&rdquo;<br>With the sky above him covered by the silver bowl, Chu Feng immediately knew that things had gone awry. The silver bowl possessed some sort of power that left Chu Feng feeling a little suppressed.<br>He immediately tried to flee, only to find that he was unable to escape from the area covered by the bowl. There was an invisible but resilient barrier that he was unable to shatter.<br>&ldquo;Looks like you have realized it, but it&rsquo;s useless. Unless you&rsquo;re able to exert a power greater than mine, or else you won&rsquo;t be able to escape out of here,&rdquo; Yin Tianchou said.<br>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t strong enough to defeat me, so you decided to use a treasure instead. Is that all Yin Tianchou is?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered coldly, mocking Yin Tianchou.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong. I did use the powers of the silver bowl, but I&rsquo;m going to defeat you with my own strength. I acknowledge that you&rsquo;re a capable person, but if you think that you&rsquo;re worthy of rivaling me, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly be more wrong.<br>&ldquo;Right here, right now, I shall show you the gap that stands between us!&rdquo;<br>Boom!<br>A pillar of flames burst forth from Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s body, rushing up to the sky.<br>These flames were a little bizarre, consisting of white flames, gray flamers, and blue flames amalgamating with one another. They formed an existence reminiscent of a dragon, and this emulation wasn&rsquo;t just limited to its form. It looked almost as if these flames had a life of its own, that it was a complete being.<br>It was a truly beautiful sight, but at the same time, it commanded deference from others.<br>This was neither martial power nor spirit power; it was bloodline power.<br>The summoning of Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s bloodline power brought Chu Feng great pressure.<br>&ldquo;How is he doing this? Not only did he manage to summon his bloodline power in a corporeal form, but his bloodline power is able to exert such great pressure on me despite not containing any spirit power at all?<br>&ldquo;Is this the effect of his treasure?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng raised his head to look at the silver bowl covering the sky above him.<br>He felt that there was something amiss about the circumstances. Most likely, it was due to the tampering of the silver bowl.<br>&ldquo;Is this the first time you are encountering such power since your birth? Let me tell you what it is then! This is a world spiritist bloodline, similar to the Heavenly Bloodlines and Divine Powers cultivators have.<br>&ldquo;However, world spiritist bloodlines are something that only world spiritists have, and it&rsquo;s far rarer than Divine Powers. Only the prodigies chosen by heaven are bestowed with this great power. And what you are witnessing right before your eyes right now is exactly that!<br>&ldquo;Do you finally understand who you are trying to go against now? I, Yin Tianchou, am the one who possesses the strongest world spiritist bloodline of all world spiritists in the Nine Souls Galaxy!&rdquo;<br>Perhaps it was to flaunt his powers, but Yin Tianchou didn&rsquo;t make a move on Chu Feng right away. Instead, he even began gleefully explaining his powers.<br>&ldquo;World spiritist bloodlines only play an auxiliary role in supporting world spiritists. Even though it can enhance one&rsquo;s spirit power and even protect one, it cannot be used directly in a battle. Yet, your world spiritist bloodline is able to exert pressure far greater than what your spirit power did. In other words, the prowess of your world spiritist bloodline far exceeds your current strength.<br>&ldquo;Why is that so? Is that because of the treasure you possess?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Yin Tianchou.<br>Even without Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s unnecessary explanation, Chu Feng could see with his own eyes that the flames were coming from Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s world spiritist bloodline. Instead, what he was more curious to know was why Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s world spiritist bloodline was able to exert such tremendous pressure on him.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. This treasure of mine has quite a background. It&rsquo;s known as the Bloodline Dimension. Strengthening my spirit power is just a side effect; its true power lies in its ability to open the Bloodline Dimension.<br>&ldquo;Unless your strength far surpasses mine, or else your spirit power is bound to fail in this space. You&rsquo;ll only be able to fight with your world spiritist bloodline here. To put it simply, one&rsquo;s strength here is determined solely by one&rsquo;s world spiritist bloodline!&rdquo; Yin Tianchou explained.<br>&ldquo;I see. It&rsquo;s no wonder why I feel so excited.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What did you say? Excited? Don&rsquo;t you feel the pressure that I&rsquo;m exerting on you? Aren&rsquo;t you afraid of the suppression coming from my world spiritist bloodline?&rdquo;<br>Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s gaze slowly turned grim. He was starting to realize that something was amiss.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, I can feel the pressure coming from your bloodline ability. However, compared to your suppression, what I feel even more vividly is my pulsating bloodline. It&rsquo;s already on the verge of gushing out of my body!<br>&ldquo;Yin Tianchou, I can tell you that I&rsquo;ve never felt so excited in my entire life. I can hardly suppress it anymore!&rdquo;<br>In Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s eyes, the smile on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face looked mystifying, perhaps sinister even.<br></p></div>
