        <h1>Chapter 5423: I Have A Good Temper</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Teleportation formations were the fastest way for a cultivator to travel, which was why crowds tended to form around teleportation formations except for those located in remote places. This made teleportation formations one of the best places to gather information.</span><br><span>Shortly after Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing stepped out of the teleportation formation, they overheard three matters.</span><br><span>First and foremost, a person who was known as the World Spiritist Painter was going to hold an exhibition very soon.</span><br><span>This matter was not of much interest to Chu Feng, but the following two matters were.</span><br><span>The second matter was that the Totem Nine Daoists had issued the Heavenly Edict of the Nine Daoists to declare that Chu Feng was under their protection.</span><br><span>Both Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing were baffled to learn about that, especially after Bai Yunqing explained just what the edict was. Neither of them had thought that the Totem Nine Daoists would go this far to protect him. Of course, this was good news for Chu Feng.</span><br><span>The third matter concerned a rumor that Chu Feng had kidnapped the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s Jia Lingyi&rsquo;s son. This was also the matter that left Chu Feng feeling uneasy.</span><br><span>According to the rumor, Chu Feng had told Jia Lingyi to personally redeem her son at the World Spiritist Painter&rsquo;s exhibition. Should she fail to do so, he would kill her son.</span><br><span>News about Chu Feng had been spreading like wildfire in the Totem Galaxy, be it him becoming the strongest late Martial Exalted level cultivator or the grudge between his grandmother and Jia Lingyi. That being said, many people doubted the credibility of these rumors particularly due to Jia Lingyi&rsquo;s high standing.</span><br><span>However, what people didn&rsquo;t know was that Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t kidnap Jia Huo at all. If anything, he didn&rsquo;t even know that Jia Lingyi had a son.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the one impersonating big brother Chu Feng?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing frowned.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;ll know once we take a look. Do you know who the World Spiritist Painter is?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The World Spiritist Painter is quite a mysterious world spiritist known for his painting formations. He occasionally holds art exhibitions and rewards those who see through his formations, but he hasn&rsquo;t held an art exhibition for decades, so I haven&rsquo;t seen any of his paintings. There&rsquo;s a rumor that he&rsquo;s related to the Dragon Breath Clan,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Chu Feng fell into deep thought. He was wondering if his impersonator was related to the World Spiritist Painter. Otherwise, there was no reason for the other party to have Jia Lingyi redeem her son during the World Spiritist Painter&rsquo;s exhibition.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, are the rumors that Jia Lingyi harmed your grandmother true?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked with a grim expression.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, they are true,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing cursed angrily.</span><br><span>He had known that Chu Feng had a grudge against Jia Lingyi, but he didn&rsquo;t know the reason behind it. It was only now that he finally understood why Chu Feng was so determined to kill Jia Lingyi. He would have made the same decision had he been in Chu Feng&rsquo;s position.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, Jia Lingyi deserves to die. Rest assured, I&rsquo;ll help you get vengeance on her no matter what it takes!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing swore.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I know that you&rsquo;re loyal, but it&rsquo;ll be best for you not to get involved in this. I don&rsquo;t want to rely on anyone else to deal with Jia Lingyi. I&rsquo;ll personally take care of her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Yunqing looked as if he still wanted to say something about it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say that your master is urgently looking for you? You should quickly head back,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>As much as he wanted to know who was impersonating him, there was still time before the exhibition. For the time being, he decided to accompany Bai Yunqing over to his master&rsquo;s place. Thus, the two of them made their way over to the mysterious mountain manor.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; a voice said as soon as they arrived before the mountain manor. It was Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing was overjoyed. He remembered how Chu Feng was stopped at the entrance the last time he tried to bring the latter in.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle was already waiting for them inside the mountain manor.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, how is your world spirit?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle asked. His attitude was much more amicable than before.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, my world spirit has recovered,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It looks like the Life Crystal is indeed a miraculous item,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle remarked.</span><br><span>Those words hinted that Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle was aware that Chu Feng had obtained the Life Crystal from the Unageing Peak.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s your relationship with the Totem Nine Daoists?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re friends,&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Just ordinary friends?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle asked.</span><br><span>Chu Feng simply smiled in response.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle also smiled.</span><br><span>&ldquo;No wonder that old thing is treating you so much better than before. It must be because of the Totem Nine Daoists and the Life Crystal. He doesn&rsquo;t dare to look down on you anymore,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only normal,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>In the world of cultivation, it was common for individuals to treat people differently based on their identities.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Did you really kidnap Jia Huo?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good to hear. Jia Lingyi is not someone to be trifled with. If there&rsquo;s no grudge between the two of you, I advise you to quickly clear things up and resolve the misunderstanding,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;While I didn&rsquo;t kidnap Jia Lingyi&rsquo;s son, I do have a grudge against Jia Lingyi,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle was surprised, but he soon smiled. &ldquo;I nearly forgot that young friend Chu Feng has the backing of the Totem Nine Daoists.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Despite his words, the atmosphere still turned peculiar.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing quickly stepped in and asked, &ldquo;Senior uncle, why did master call me back this time around?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;We have reached a crucial phase in the construction of a formation, but we need the help of a junior world spiritist in order to perfect it. However, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like we&rsquo;ll need you anymore. Ta&rsquo;er has invited a junior from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to work on the formation,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;A junior from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion? Who is it?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;His name is Ling Hang. Since you&rsquo;re here, why don&rsquo;t you go and take a look?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle said as he led the two of them deeper into the mountain manor.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who is Ling Hang? Have you heard about him?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, I have heard about him. He was a well-known prodigy in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion before Ling Xiao and the others came to prominence. I&rsquo;m surprised that he&rsquo;s still within the age range of a junior,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who is Ta&rsquo;er?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big sister Ta&rsquo;er is my senior uncle&rsquo;s daughter. Speaking of which, big sister Ta&rsquo;er has a horrible temper and her words might make you a little uncomfortable. Big brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll have to ask you to bear with her later on,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;No worries, I have a good temper,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span><br></p></div>
