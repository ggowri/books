        <h1>Chapter 4899</h1>
        <div>: Two Hours<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, how are you feeling?&rdquo;<br>A person stepped through the crowd and approached Chu Feng. She grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm and began checking his body from head to toe. Following that, she took out a few pills and stuffed them into Chu Feng&rsquo;s mouth.<br>Had it been anyone else, Chu Feng would have surely sent her flying with a slap. However, he chose to watch as that person did as she pleased with a smile.<br>That was because she was none other than Long Xiaoxiao.<br>Long Xiaoxiao was simply too worried about Chu Feng that she brought out all of her best pills.<br>&ldquo;Hey, Xiaoxiao. Even if these pills are beneficial to my recovery, you can&rsquo;t just feed them to me as if they are grains of rice. That&rsquo;s too much!&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked with a chuckle as he took a step back, refusing to swallow the medicine.<br>&ldquo;These pills will help with your recovery,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao advised.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. These injuries mean nothing at all. There&rsquo;s no need for any recovery pills,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>He meant what he said. These injuries were minor compared to what he had suffered before, and he was already used to it by now.<br>Besides, the pills that Long Xiaoxiao had to offer wouldn&rsquo;t help much in his recovery.<br>&ldquo;Are you really fine?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked with a frown.<br>As a world spiritist herself, she could tell the injuries Chu Feng&rsquo;s had sustained, so she didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng was really fine.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really fine. Stop crying. You&rsquo;re a princess of the Dragon Clan. Others will laugh at you for this,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he pinched Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s little cheeks.<br>He noticed that Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s eyes were glistening with tears, so he was trying to console her by teasing her a little.<br>&ldquo;Who says that I&rsquo;m crying?&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao also thought that it wasn&rsquo;t appropriate for her to cry under such circumstances, so she quickly wiped off the tears brimming in her eyes. However, she soon turned to Chu Feng and asked once more, &ldquo;Are you really fine?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m really fine. Give me two hours, and I&rsquo;ll be able to make a full recovery by then,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll give you two hours then. If you don&rsquo;t recover by then, you&rsquo;ll have to eat all of my pills.&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao pulled out another fistful of pills from her Cosmos Sack. It was enough to fill half a rice bowl. However, she wasn&rsquo;t trying to harm Chu Feng here.<br>These pills were actually incredibly valuable. Even if Chu Feng consumed all of it, it wouldn&rsquo;t have any adverse side effects on his body.<br>Chu Feng was left at a loss for words.<br>Even though Long Xiaoxiao tended to be a little mischievous, she was like a mature adult when it came down to business. Yet, she felt a little doltish right now.<br>Of course, Chu Feng understood how Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s changes had come about.<br>&ldquo;Alright. If I don&rsquo;t recover by then, I&rsquo;ll eat all of your pills,&rdquo; Chu Feng gave his promise.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a deal then! You mustn&rsquo;t go back on your words!&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao stretched out her pinky, demanding Chu Feng to seal the promise between them with a pinky hook.<br>With a chuckle, Chu Feng hooked her pinky and affirmed his promise.<br>Meanwhile, Shengguang Shishen glanced at his drenched right hand. He had been sweating profusely all this while out of nervously. In his hand was a small jade stone that was around the size of a fingernail, and hidden in the jade stone was a talisman paper.<br>If he were to crush the talisman paper, it would immediately alert the Holy Monarch of the danger that the Holy Valley was in.<br>He was worried that the expert who had yet to reveal himself thus far would really massacre the Holy Valley should anything happen to Chu Feng. The only one who stood a chance at dealing with an expert of that caliber was the Holy Monarch.<br>If Chu Feng had really died in the Holy Lotus Tree&rsquo;s cultivation realm, he would crush the talisman paper right away to inform the Holy Monarch.<br>It was fortunate that the worst didn&rsquo;t happen.<br>Since Chu Feng was safe and sound, it was unlikely that the expert would show himself. So, he shot one last nervous glance at the jade stone before stowing it away.<br>Most of the members from the Holy Valley watched the interaction between Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao with nonchalance, but there was one person who revealed a look of displeasure.<br>That person was none other than Shengguang Xintian.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I have a request,&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly spoke to Shengguang Buyu.<br>He could tell that Shengguang Buyu wasn&rsquo;t the one who called the shots here, but the latter seemed to be on close terms with Daoist Niantian. If there was anyone in the Holy Valley whom he could trust, that person would be Shengguang Buyu.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, feel free to state your request,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I would like to use your Holy Valley&rsquo;s cultivation land for a breakthrough,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Everyone immediately turned their eyes toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, are you going to make a breakthrough in your martial cultivation or spirit power?&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu asked.<br>&ldquo;Martial cultivation,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, when do you need it?&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu asked.<br>&ldquo;Right now,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>The crowd from the Holy Valley revealed conflicted looks on their faces.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words were suggesting that he was going to make a breakthrough.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, are you already on the verge of a breakthrough now?&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu asked directly.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I can already feel my bottleneck now. I&rsquo;m not sure whether I&rsquo;ll succeed, so I&rsquo;d like to use your cultivation land to further my chances,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>The crowd gasped in astonishment.<br>It was already shocking enough that Chu Feng was able to recover his cultivation in the cultivation land, but he was actually going to make a breakthrough now!<br>Most of the elders of the Holy Valley had already asked the juniors about what they had gained from the Holy Lotus Tree. The benefits from the Holy Lotus Tree would indeed help them in the long run, but it wouldn&rsquo;t induce an immediate rise in their cultivation.<br>So why was Chu Feng going to make a breakthrough right now?<br>Could this really be the difference in their talent?<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng is indeed an incredible individual. Here, follow me.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Buyu couldn&rsquo;t conceal the conflicted look on his face, but he still led the way for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Wait here for me,&rdquo; Chu Feng instructed Long Xiaoxiao before leaving with Shengguang Buyu.<br>But as soon as Chu Feng and Shengguang Buyu started walking away, a frail voice echoed from behind. It was extremely weak, but the crowd was still able to hear it loud and clear.<br>It was from Shengguang Haoxuan.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, kill Chu Feng. Kill Chu Feng&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Haoxuan didn&rsquo;t lose his consciousness, but he had been delirious from the constant excruciating pain he was put under. It was only thanks to the treatment of the elders that he finally regained a shred of his rationality.<br>Upon realizing he was safe now, he turned to Shengguang Baimei in hopes that the latter would avenge him.<br>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;<br>However, his plea was immediately shut down by Shengguang Baimei.<br>Shengguang Baimai anxiously turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, you should quickly head over and strive to make a breakthrough in your cultivation. You need not bother about this brat.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng responded with a smile before leaving with Shengguang Buyu.<br>Shengguang Haoxuan was confused by the development of events.<br>Be it his widened empty eye sockets, agape tongueless mouth, or stiffened expression, they all showcased the utmost shock he was feeling at the moment.<br>He could tell that the person who spoke earlier was Shengguang Baimei. He could at least tell as much even if he was unable to see.<br>But why would Lord Baimei say such words?<br>What was going on right now?<br></p></div>
