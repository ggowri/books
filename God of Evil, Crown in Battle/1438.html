        <div> - Becoming A Very Capable Individual<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I am truly sorry. Although I do not know why you wanted the lotus seed so badly, with this lotus seed having been sealed to this state, it most definitely possesses no value and is of no use anymore.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about this? I&rsquo;ll make it up to you. This Raging Flames Metal, let&rsquo;s split it evenly,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said in an embarrassed manner.<br>The way he saw it, the lotus seed was pretty much worthless to begin with. Now that it had been sealed, it had become a purely decorative item.<br>Thus, Hong Qiang felt very ashamed that he was unable to accomplish what he had promised Chu Feng. As such, he wanted to use the Raging Flames Metal to compensate Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this seal should be able to be broken apart, right?&rdquo; Compared with Hong Qiang, Chu Feng was not very moody.<br>&ldquo;All seals are capable of being broken. However, the seal on this lotus seed is something that the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower set up with all of its power in its final moments.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let me say it this way. If the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower were to continue to fight with me, I would still have had to exhaust quite a bit of strength in order to subdue it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, because it had used all of its strength to destroy this lotus seed, I managed to seize the opportunity to rapidly kill it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, this seal on the lotus seed is very thorny and problematic. Truth be told, the current me does not possess any means of breaking the seal on the lotus seed,&rdquo; Hong Qiang shook his head in an embarrassed manner.<br>&ldquo;I have a spirit formation that might be able to break the seal on the lotus seed. Merely, this spirit formation has a very high requirement for the purity of the spirit power involved. I&rsquo;m afraid I would have to ask senior to help me with it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What sort of spirit formation is it?&rdquo; Hong Qiang asked in a surprised manner. At the same time, he was feeling skeptical. He did not think that Chu Feng would possess a spirit formation capable of undoing the seal on the lotus seed. After all, even he was not capable of breaking the seal.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this formation,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he flipped his hand and waved it toward the empty sky. Soon, a spirit formation&rsquo;s design that emitted radiance like the glistening stars appeared before Hong Qiang.<br>This was not as simple as being only the form of a spirit formation. It also contained details of the profoundness of the formation as well as how to set it up. Furthermore, it was extremely detailed and concise. For experts like Hong Qiang, they would be able to learn all about the spirit formation with a single glance. As long as they meticulously studied it for a short period of time, they would be able to grasp the profoundness of this spirit formation in no time.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment.&rdquo;<br>After seeing this spirit formation diagram, Hong Qiang was stunned. He was so stunned that he was unable to move his eyes away from the spirit formation diagram. As he told Chu Feng to wait, his eyes started to shine with light. He was actually using a special sort of observation method to earnestly survey the spirit formation diagram that Chu Feng had sketched out.<br>Chu Feng knew that Hong Qiang was studying the spirit formation. Thus, he stood to the side and did not say anything. Without bothering Hong Qiang, Chu Feng stood and watched in silence.<br>That was because Chu Feng knew that if Hong Qiang were to use this spirit formation, he would definitely be able to break the seal on the lotus seed. In that case, the final seal that the Raging Flames Metallic Lotus Flower had placed on its seed would be a wasted effort.<br>Actually, it was also possible for Chu Feng to undo the seal himself. However, due to the fact that he was only an Insect Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, it might take him an extremely long time to undo the seal on the lotus seed.<br>However, if it was Hong Qiang, it would be much easier. At the very least, if Hong Qiang were to use this spirit formation to undo the seal, he would be much faster than Chu Feng. That was the reason why Chu Feng had asked for Hong Qiang&rsquo;s help.<br>After a long time, Hong Qiang finally spoke. At this time, an amazed and excited expression covered his face. He was very emotional. It was as if he had just found a rare and unequaled treasure. &ldquo;Amazing, truly amazing. I, Hong, have meticulously studied world spirit techniques for all these years. Yet, this is the first time that I have ever encountered such a miraculous seal breaking formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not my first time, it&rsquo;s the second time. The first time was that sword. It&rsquo;s that sword that you gave me that contained sealing properties.&rdquo;<br>In fact, powerful spirit formations were equivalent to treasures for world spiritists. Thus, it was not surprising for Hong Qiang to have his current reaction.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, could it be that that sword was also created by you?&rdquo; Suddenly, Hong Qiang looked to Chu Feng. He thought of a possibility, an astonishing possibility.<br>&ldquo;Truth be told, senior, that sword was indeed created by this junior. I hope that senior will not blame junior for deciding things on his own and going against senior&rsquo;s wish of escaping and coming here instead,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What sorts of words are those? If it wasn&rsquo;t for you coming here, I would already be dead. You have saved my life, how could I possibly blame you?&rdquo; Not only did Hong Qiang not blame Chu Feng, he was instead extremely grateful toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, in that case, you have already become a royal-cloak world spiritist?&rdquo; Hong Qiang asked. He knew that it was only possible for royal-cloak world spiritists to create that Sealing Sword.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;Who would&rsquo;ve known, I have underestimated you this entire time, boy.&rdquo; Hong Qiang gasped with awe. However, his face was filled with smiles. He was feeling happy for Chu Feng and, more than that, seeing Chu Feng with a whole new level of respect.<br>&ldquo;Senior, have you managed to grasp this spirit formation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;With how detailed your diagram is, if I were not able to grasp it, I would have lived all these years of my life in vain,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said with laughter.<br>&ldquo;In that case, senior, is this spirit formation capable of breaking the seal on the lotus seed?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It is. However, I will need some time. If I am to give it my all, I might be able to break this seal by the time of the Nine Powers Hunt.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, Chu Feng, why are you so interested in this lotus seed?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t possibly be interested in the natural energy contained within the lotus seed, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, although the lotus seed contains a very dense amount of energy, the energy within it is extremely berserk and impossible to be refined. Chu Feng, you must definitely not think about refining it,&rdquo; Hong Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please rest assured, this junior will not do anything too dangerous,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile. Although he needed the natural energy contained within the lotus seed, he feared that Hong Qiang would worry about him. Hence the reason why he had decided to reply to Hong Qiang this way<br>Chu Feng said those words very openly. He did not declare that he would not use the natural energy within the lotus seed. However, at the same time, Chu Feng had also managed to lessen Hong Qiang&rsquo;s worry.<br>After all, to Chu Feng, refining the natural energy within this lotus seed was not something dangerous. With his Divine Lightning, regardless of how berserk the energy might be, he would still be able to refine it.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, that&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; After hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s reply, Hong Qiang felt relieved.<br>&ldquo;Senior, in that case, I&rsquo;ll be troubling you with this lotus seed. Junior has a matter that he must attend to in the World Spiritist Alliance. Let&rsquo;s meet again in the Cyanwood Mountain during the Nine Powers Hunt.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had been worried about the situation in the World Spiritist Alliance the entire time. As the matter in this place had been settled, Chu Feng naturally had to hurry to the World Spiritist Alliance as quickly as possible.<br>&ldquo;Boy, never would I have known that you also had a relationship with the World Spiritist Alliance. Very well, if you have matters that you need to attend to, then go ahead. However, you must be careful,&rdquo; Hong Qiang warned.<br>&ldquo;Junior will definitely be careful,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist with one hand respectfully and then turned to leave.<br>Hong Qiang did not see Chu Feng off. Instead, he had stayed there the entire time. Only when Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura had completely disappeared did he say, &ldquo;The Eastern Sea Region&rsquo;s Heavenly Road is different from the rest. Compared to the other three Sea Regions&rsquo; Heavenly Roads, it was many times more dangerous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is said that all the youngsters who are capable of passing through that Heavenly Road will all become very capable individuals.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, seeing it with my own eyes, it seems to really be the case. Chu Feng, this old man is truly looking forward to seeing you, a person of the Eastern Sea Region, shining on the stage of the Holy Land of Martialism.&rdquo; As Hong Qiang said these words, an expression of anticipation filled his face.<br></p></div>
