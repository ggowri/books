        <div> - Sneaking into the Misty Peak<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>When people from various areas headed towards the Misty Peak, there was also an army of ten million that covertly snuck in.<br>They were disguised and walked beneath the sea&mdash;it was the Crippling Night Demon Sect led by Chu Feng.<br>However, no one knew of their arrival because at that very instant, they were all deep under the sea. They were surrounding a round boulder.<br>&ldquo;Sect Head, you&rsquo;re certain the formation Lady Piaomiao spoke of is here?&rdquo; You Mingdeng slightly frowned as some doubt arose.<br>After all, he was a rank four Martial King and a Gold-cloak World Spiritist. Yet, he could not tell what was special about that boulder.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about it.&rdquo; Chu Feng lightly smiled as he firmly nodded. Actually, if it weren&rsquo;t for the Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, he too wouldn&rsquo;t have found that formation because it was really too hidden.<br>But despite Chu Feng&rsquo;s assurance, You Mingdeng, and even many others, were doubtful. No matter how you looked at it, this boulder didn&rsquo;t seem like a boundless formation that could move millions of people.<br>&ldquo;Master, you can activate this formation.&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled again, and then with mental messaging, he sent the rest of the information to Qiu Canfeng.<br>Qiu Canfeng&rsquo;s eyes lit up after hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. Then, he stood out and laid an Activation Formation on the boulder.<br>*hmm*<br>When the formation was in progress of activating, the seemingly ordinary boulder immediately shone with radiance. The light quickly converged to form a formation which then enveloped all the members within.<br>When countless runes swirled around, layer after layer of odd power drifted within the formation.<br>&ldquo;Waa, it truly is a formation! It&rsquo;s amazing!&rdquo;<br>Almost everyone was shocked by its appearance. Expressions of surprise surfaced onto their faces.<br>They could feel the power it contained, and they also understood its profoundness.<br>Even a person like Qiu Canfeng couldn&rsquo;t help praising, &ldquo;As expected of Lady Piaomiao. This is truly something not an ordinary person can do.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is a formation Senior Piaomiao spent several hundred years building. To say it&rsquo;s her life&rsquo;s work wouldn&rsquo;t be an exaggeration.<br>&ldquo;This formation is as abstract as the Formation of Multitudinous Talismanic Soldiers cast by Jiang Qisha. It&rsquo;s even a bit more powerful.<br>&ldquo;As long as it borrows a bit of the Crippling Night Demon Sect&rsquo;s power, it can create warriors as powerful as us and we can also control them.<br>&ldquo;On the day of the wedding, Murong Mingtian and Jiang Qisha will definitely welcome the various guests. At that time, activate this formation and attack the Misty Peak.<br>&ldquo;When the army attacks, even if their defenses are enough to stop us, they will ignore the inside of the Misty Peak. I and the First Immortal will then go the stone tablet, and I will cultivate the Immortal Transference Mysterious Technique,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;But Sect Head, even though it&rsquo;s powerful, this formation cannot allow us to completely overtake the Misty Peak. It will at most catch them off guard for a short while.<br>&ldquo;As for the Immortal Transference Mysterious Technique, it clearly isn&rsquo;t something that&rsquo;s easy to cultivate. There&rsquo;s only a brief amount of time! What if you&rsquo;re discovered?&rdquo; They were still not too worried.<br>&ldquo;Naturally, the Mysterious Technique isn&rsquo;t easy to cultivate, but I doubt it will be so challenging that I will fail.<br>&ldquo;Lady Piaomiao had described its cultivation difficulty. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, I should finish within half a day,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Half a day?&rdquo; You Mingdeng and the others couldn&rsquo;t help deeply gasping.<br>&ldquo;Half a day is enough. Otherwise, my Zi Ling would truly become his.&rdquo; Chu Feng faintly smiled&mdash;confidence was worn on the corners of his mouth.<br>&ldquo;Then&hellip; fine. We will follow your arrangements.&rdquo; You Mingdeng and the others no longer doubted him.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, the success of this conquest will depend on you. If we obtain victory, all of you have done deeds of absolute importance. I, Chu Feng, will definitely repay all of you.&rdquo; Chu Feng was very thankful&mdash;thankful for these millions of people who were willing to put their lives on the line just for his sake.<br>&ldquo;Sect Head will be victorious! The Crippling Night Demon Sect will be victorious!&rdquo; someone suddenly shouted.<br>&ldquo;Sect Head will be victorious! The Crippling Night Demon Sect will be victorious!&rdquo; Quickly after, everyone started yelling. With these words, they declared their unyielding loyalty towards Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t blame them or anything for making such a ruckus. Although this was already within the borders of the Misty Peak, the sea was very deep. Moreover, they had already laid Concealment Spirit Formations beforehand. Even if they were shouting loudly here, people outside wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hear them.<br>However, he had to admit, when seeing so many people willing to fight for him, he not only felt gratitude, he felt very emotional.<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t dally any longer. He leapt forward and came by the First Immortal&rsquo;s side.<br>The First Immortal&rsquo;s eyes were glittering, and he said unbelievably, &ldquo;I had thought you relied on your master Qiu Canfeng to become sect head, but I now seem to be wrong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hoh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng gave a light smile, then said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng consumed the Alternation Pellet Lady Piaomiao prepared for him. After changing his appearance, he pretended to be the First Immortal&rsquo;s servant as they advanced toward the Misty Peak.<br>When they came above the sea surface, Chu Feng saw a lively scene he had never seen before. There were not only several new palaces built within the Misty Peak, it was very crowded scene. One could see people everywhere in the sky.<br>Rough estimations gave him a number of over a hundred million people. Ninety percent were from other Eastern Sea Region forces. They came here just to watch the upcoming display.<br>No one was denied entry to the Misty Peak at that moment. Regardless of strength, position, or status, so long as they came here, they would have good food and good residences. It was quality treatment of guests.<br>&ldquo;Your Immortal Execution Archipelago truly isn&rsquo;t simple. They&rsquo;ve made such a huge show even when they give their own fianc&eacute;e to others.&rdquo; Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but mock the First Immortal when they saw such a grand presentation.<br>&ldquo;Hoh&hellip;&rdquo; It was now his turn to give a light smile. Then, he said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Even if it gets more impressive, so what? It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re going to allow this marriage to be held successfully.&rdquo;<br>The First Immortal dashed forward and increased his flying speed towards the Misty Peak.<br>Chu Feng lightly smiled as well. He too dashed forward and followed the First Immortal&rsquo;s steps.<br>With the First Immortal leading the way, they were met with no obstructions even though it was occupied by the Immortal Execution Archipelago. They thus easily entered the Misty Peak.<br></p></div>
