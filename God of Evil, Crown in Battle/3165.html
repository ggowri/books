        <div> - Grand Defensive Formation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Little brother, you do not understand this. You&rsquo;ve seen it earlier too, those Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen have all fled in the direction of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan. They have most definitely gone to seek help from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With the way the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan handles things, they will definitely not allow anyone to challenge their authority. Because of this, they will definitely not let Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan get away with what they&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we brothers are to show ourselves now, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen will become more confident. At that time, even if the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan is to show up, they will not be afraid.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if we don&rsquo;t reveal ourselves, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen will definitely be terror-stricken the moment the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan arrives.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When they&rsquo;re in despair, we brothers will then come to their aid. At that time&hellip; they will become utterly grateful towards us, and firmly remember our kindness in their hearts,&rdquo; the elder of the Dongguo Mighty Duo said.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, that&rsquo;s truly brilliant. It&rsquo;s as they say, the older the ginger, the spicier it is. You are the wise one,&rdquo; the younger of the Dongguo Mighty Duo began to praise his older brother nonstop.<br>Being praised by his younger brother, the older brother revealed a smile on his face.<br>The two of them had no clue that even if they were to enter the palace to seek out Chu Feng at that moment, they would not be able to find him.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng was not inside the palace. Instead, he had entered a different place.<br>It was an isolated space. Powerful formations filled that world.<br>In the sky and on the ground, formations could be seen all over. The formations shone brightly, and looked exceptionally spectacular.<br>Chu Feng was able to arrive there purely by relying on his intuition, which had helped him find the entrance in the palace.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for his intuition, Chu Feng would not be able to find the entrance even if he were to use his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to search for it.<br>Inside the isolated space, Chu Feng currently had an expression of astonishment on his face.<br>&ldquo;What powerful spirit formations!&rdquo; Even Her Lady Queen was unable to keep herself from letting out a gasp of surprise.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Chu Feng, quickly, let this Queen out. This Queen wants to sense the spirit power contained in this place,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen urged excitedly.<br>Since Her Lady Queen had made a demand, Chu Feng would naturally not refuse her. Immediately, he opened his World Spirit Gate.<br>Upon opening the World Spirit Gate, a beautiful woman leaped out from it. She was naturally Her Lady Queen.<br>&ldquo;Wow! The spirit power in this place is truly dense. I truly wonder who set this place up,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen gasped with admiration.<br>&ldquo;It should have been set up by my grandfather, and improved on by my father afterwards,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;If I tell you that it&rsquo;s intuition, will you trust me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile.<br>&ldquo;No. Quickly, tell me exactly how you found this place. Does this place contain the auras of your grandfather and father?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;I am truly not lying to you. After all, this place simply doesn&rsquo;t contain either my father or my grandfather&rsquo;s auras,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Really? How come that sounds so unbelievable to me?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said with a frown.<br>Her wrinkled face was quite cute.<br>Chu Feng smiled lightly. He said, &ldquo;Indeed, it&rsquo;s very magical. Perhaps this is the power of one&rsquo;s bloodline.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, are you able to activate this formation now?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked concernedly.<br>After all, whether or not Chu Feng would be able to protect the main city would all depend on the grand protective formation.<br>&ldquo;The grand formations inside this place are all very powerful and very complicated. Not only are there grand defensive formations, but there are also grand slaughtering formations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, the spirit formations in this place are all too strong. Not to mention the grand slaughtering formations, it will likely be very difficult for me to even activate any of the grand defensive formations,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, do you have certainty in being able to activate this formation?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;I do not possess absolute certainty. However, I can give it a try.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well, go ahead and give it a try then, this Queen will go and have a stroll around,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said those words and then planned to leave.<br>&ldquo;My dear Eggy, where are you going?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;Hehe, actually, I might as well tell you about it. Upon coming to this place, this Queen has felt some intuition. I will go see if my intuition will help this Queen find anything,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Very well then, go on ahead. However, you must be careful,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, this Queen is your world spirit. I am unable to go too far away from you. I will still be within your range. Furthermore, this is a formation set up by your grandfather and father, how could it possibly do anything to me?&rdquo;<br>As Her Lady Queen spoke, she leapt away into the distance.<br>Seeing the cheerful and lighthearted appearance of Her Lady Queen, a smile appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>After all these years, Her Lady Queen still had the temperament of a young girl. Her consistency just so happened to be what Chu Feng liked the most.<br>After Her Lady Queen left, Chu Feng arrived before a spirit formation and sat down cross-legged.<br>That place was the location of the formation core for all of the main city&rsquo;s spirit formations, and contained multiple different spirit formations.<br>As for the spirit formation before Chu Feng, it could be said to be the weakest defensive formation there.<br>However, even though it was the weakest spirit formation, Chu Feng would still need to put forth his all in order to have a chance to harmonize with it. Only after harmonizing his power with its power would Chu Feng be able to control that formation.<br>Likely, the reason why no one in the Chu Heavenly Clan knew about those spirit formations was because of how difficult it was to control them. After all, even if one were to know about them, it would still be of no use, since they simply would not be able to activate them.<br>Meanwhile, as Chu Feng was putting forth all of his effort to harmonize with that defensive formation, another scene was happening in the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.<br>Inside a certain palace hall in the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s territory. Qingyu Fengming and the many Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen were all gathered there. Qingyu Dong was also among them.<br>However, at that moment, Qingyu Dong was kneeling on the ground and not daring to even raise his head.<br>He was receiving a punishment. The reason why he was being punished was because Qingyu Fengming had reported him, stating that he had completely disgraced their Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan before the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>However, there were two different voices that were being heard in the main hall.<br>One side was in favor of suppressing the Chu Heavenly Clan, whereas the other side was against it.<br>After all, regardless of whether or not Qingyu Fengming had added details to his story, the crowd were still capable of telling that Chu Feng was no simple character.<br>As such, there was a small portion of people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan that felt that it would be best to not make an enemy of Chu Feng.<br>The reason for that was because they had witnessed the emergence in power of a great amount of individuals. In fact, they&rsquo;d even personally witnessed how the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Wuma Shengjie emerged in power in a short period of time and defeated numerous opponents.<br>Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s opponents all ended up with tragic endings and completely ruined, unable to rise again.<br>As for Chu Feng, he was, after all, Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son. These people felt that Chu Feng might become the second Wuma Shengjie of the Eastern Region, and that it was not a good idea for their Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan to make an enemy of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Enough, all of you, stop quarreling!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice was heard. Following that voice, the palace hall that was originally filled with voices in dispute became exceptionally quiet.<br>The person who spoke was sitting in the master seat of the palace hall. With sharp sword-like brows and bright eyes, that man had a very handsome look to him. He was the sort of handsome man that could bewitch many women merely by his looks.<br>As for that man, his name was Qingyu Ruize. He was the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s strongest individual in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. He was also the leader of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clansmen.<br></p></div>
