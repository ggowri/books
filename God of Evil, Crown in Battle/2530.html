        <div> - Chanced Encounter With Li Ming<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>After journeying for some time, Chu Feng arrived at the so-called Demon Elimination Cave.<br>The Demon Elimination Cave was located in an enormous basin. This basin was so enormous that it could be described as being boundless.<br>Brilliant green stones were flickering within the basin. Even though it was night, this place was still exceptionally bright.<br>At a glance, the basin appeared to be an ocean filled with green gems. It was a very spectacular scene.<br>The Demon Elimination Cave was actually a very beautiful place. It could be considered to be a very scenic land.<br>However, the Demon Elimination Cave was a forbidden area of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. The reason for that was because this Demon Elimination Cave originated from the Ancient Era.<br>Reportedly, a very ferocious Monstrous Clan once appeared in the Ancient Era. That Monstrous Clan possessed special Inherited Bloodlines and enormous power. They began to run amuck throughout the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm fearlessly.<br>Later on, the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm&rsquo;s many experts joined hands to resist the Monstrous Clan. They chose a peculiar terrain to set up countless traps and slaughtering formations.<br>Later on, those experts lured the Monstrous Clan into a battle at that location.<br>The Monstrous Clan did not know of the traps. After being lured into that place, they were eradicated by the countless traps and slaughtering formations.<br>From then on, the fierce Monstrous Clan disappeared. From that point on&hellip; that location where they were eradicated was known as the Demon Elimination Cave. [1. Discovered that it should be Monstrous Elimination Cave. However, it&rsquo;s over a hundred chapters to change. I guess I should just keep it as-is.]<br>Those slaughtering formations from the Ancient Era were still present in the Demon Elimination Cave. Those traps were also still present. Due to the fact that the slaughtering formations and traps were extremely dangerous, even True Immortals did not dare to enter the Demon Elimination Cave at will.<br>Thus, the Demon Elimination Cave could be said to be one of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm&rsquo;s most fiercely famous forbidden areas.<br>However, Chu Feng knew of a safe passage. This passage was capable of allowing him to avoid countless slaughtering formations and traps to enter the depths of the Demon Elimination Cave safely.<br>&ldquo;This place is truly a wondrous location.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng had already entered the Demon Elimination Cave.<br>He was currently proceeding according to the route. Upon entering the Demon Elimination Cave, Chu Feng discovered that although the Demon Elimination Cave was boundlessly vast when judged from the outside, he felt that the inside was even more vast upon entering it.<br>The Demon Elimination Cave was simply too enormous. Even for Chu Feng, it would likely take him several days of travel to reach its depths.<br>With that in mind, Chu Feng began to ponder. Those seniors from the Ancient Era, exactly how enormous of an effort did they put in to set up all these slaughtering formations and traps inside this place?<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, listen, it seems like something is shouting,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s gentle and beautiful voice was heard. She was warning Chu Feng.<br>It was not that Her Lady Queen was nervous. As Chu Feng entered further into the Demon Elimination Cave, many strange sounds could be heard. Some were louder than others, and some sounded closer than others.<br>Those sounds resembled the anguished wailing of fierce ghosts. Yet, they also resembled a mixture of screams, roars and cries of resentment from people.<br>Some of the sounds appeared to be from very far away, whereas others appeared to be right beside one&rsquo;s ear. Those were noises that caused one&rsquo;s blood to run cold. It was very frightening.<br>Chu Feng swept through his surroundings with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, but was unable to see anything. However, the further he went into the Demon Elimination Cave, the more distinct the sounds became.<br>&ldquo;The terrain of this place is very special. Furthermore, there&rsquo;s all these slaughtering formations set up here. This makes it so that sounds that have originated here before continue to linger.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I think that these sounds we&rsquo;re hearing are the sounds from the participants of that major battle during the Ancient Era,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;If that really is the case, then with how enormous this place is and how the sounds are present throughout this place, the battle back then was truly vast. There were most definitely a lot of casualties,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;Although many of the things from the Ancient Era have become mysteries now, there is one thing that is widely accepted by everyone. That is, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s martial cultivators were stronger than the current martial cultivators,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, in that case, do you think all of the experts from the Ancient Era are all dead? Could some have managed to survive?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to say. Even in the Eastern Sea Region, there was a wondrous land like the Misty Peak. I believe there is no lack of wondrous lands in this vast Outer World.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since there are Ancient Era&rsquo;s Organisms that cannot be explained still present, then it would not be impossible for the experts that traveled about unhindered through the Ancient Era to still be living today,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re alive, they must be really powerful,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;If there are really those that survived from the Ancient Era, I truly wish to meet them,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled.<br>&ldquo;That said, with how devastating the battle from back then was, sounds from the battle shouldn&rsquo;t be the only things that remain, no? There should be bones and remains. Why are no bones to be seen here?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;They must&rsquo;ve been retrieved by others,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;They have truly picked everything clean,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;Mn?&rdquo; Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze changed. After his gaze was cast toward a location, he suddenly stopped moving forward.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her?&rdquo; At that moment, Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s gaze also changed. A surprised expression emerged in her beautiful eyes.<br>As Chu Feng possessed the Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, he was not only able to see through obstructions, but was also able to see very far.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng and Her Lady Queen were seeing a slaughtering formation.<br>The slaughtering formation was currently active. At that moment, there was actually a person trapped inside the slaughtering formation.<br>At that moment, all of the powers of that slaughtering formation were attacking that individual with the intention to kill them.<br>As for the person that was trapped, it was a young man. Not only was he very young, but his skin was also very tender, soft and fair. It was even better than the skin of many women.<br>As for his face, it was also very delicate and fine. If he were a female, he would definitely be a beauty.<br>In fact, that person actually was a female. She was a female dressed up as a man.<br>She was Young Master Li Ming.<br>&ldquo;Enemies of a narrow road. To encounter her here, that girl is truly one to travel everywhere. Why would she come to the Demon Elimination Cave?&rdquo; Chu Feng had a surprised expression on his face.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plan? Are you going to help her?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked mischievously.<br>&ldquo;That slaughtering formation that has trapped her is no small matter. It is very difficult to breach from the inside. Although she is also a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, it is still very difficult for her to breach that slaughtering formation. Logically, I should help her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, she clearly harbored hard feelings for me due to what happened last time. I&rsquo;m afraid that if I am to save her, she will not only not be grateful, but will instead attack me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, the gains will not make up for the losses,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;When you fought her last time, you were still a rank seven Martial Ancestor. However, you&rsquo;re a rank eight Martial Ancestor now. As for her, judging by her aura&hellip; she should still be a rank nine Martial Ancestor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if the two of you both possess heaven-defying battle powers capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, don&rsquo;t forget that you&rsquo;re a Heavenly Bloodline possessor, and have also grasped the two great secret skills of Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe and Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword. She is no match for you,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;Milady Queen, it seems like you very much want me to help her? She&rsquo;s a little beauty. Furthermore, that feeling is truly exceptional.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I am to go help her, wouldn&rsquo;t Milady Queen feel jealous?&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a mischievous laugh.<br>&ldquo;Humph~~~ Humph~~~&rdquo;<br>Her Lady Queen did not answer Chu Feng, and instead replied with two snorts.<br>Her two snorts were truly mocking in nature. It was like two sledgehammers ruthlessly smashing onto Chu Feng&rsquo;s head. They were telling him that he was overthinking things.<br>Her Lady Queen would simply not be jealous. The reason why she was not jealous was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s status in her heart had yet to reach that level.<br>Regardless of how much Her Lady Queen cared about Chu Feng, she only considered him a friend, and not a lover.<br>&ldquo;Sigh~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng sighed awkwardly. Then, he flew toward the slaughtering formation trapping Young Master Li Ming.<br>Chu Feng did not dislike Young Master Li Ming. In fact, he felt guilty for touching her breasts by accident.<br>And now, she was in danger. Chu Feng would naturally help her.<br><br></p></div>
