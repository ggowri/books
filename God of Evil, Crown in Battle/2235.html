        <div> - Intentional Retaliation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re finally here.&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing Chu Feng, Liu Xiaoli immediately revealed a cheerful expression. Like everyone else, she focused her gaze onto Chu Feng.<br>In fact, it was not only them, as even Grandmaster Pocket, Daoist Three Swords and the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors stopped their fight to look toward Chu Feng.<br>They all wanted to know what sort of armor Chu Feng would be able to obtain. After all, he was an Asura World Spiritist.<br>Furthermore, it was all thanks to Chu Feng that they were able to break through the purple fog earlier.<br>In the crowd&rsquo;s hearts, Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques were the strongest among the people present.<br>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you smiling happily earlier? Why do you have a sulky expression now? Could it be that you&rsquo;re feeling pressure now that little brother Chu Feng has arrived?&rdquo; Daoist Three Swords mocked the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors.<br>He knew that he would not be a match for the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors. Thus, he felt extremely happy when Chu Feng appeared.<br>The reason for that was because he knew that Chu Feng would be able to suppress the eldest Four World Spiritist Emperor.<br>&ldquo;Humph? Pressure? You&rsquo;re saying that he could pressure me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is great that he has come. I will let him know who the actual world spiritist genius is,&rdquo; The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors declared.<br>Even though he was speaking with a very unyielding tone, only he knew that he was feeling a slight lack of confidence when facing Chu Feng.<br>After all, Chu Feng&rsquo;s display of world spirit techniques earlier had been extremely strong.<br>Before the focused attention of the crowd, Chu Feng closed his eyes and carefully felt the special spirit power covering his entire body in the form of a suit of armor.<br>&ldquo;The Golden Crane True Immortal is truly amazing. He is actually able to set up a spirit formation as wondrous as this.&rdquo;<br>When Chu Feng personally experienced the power of that spirit formation covering his body and sealing away his strength before transforming into a sort of new strength formed with spirit power in his body, he felt as if his body was being completely transformed.<br>A spirit formation as profound as that was truly very amazing.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha!!!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng heard sudden laughter.<br>Upon hearing that laughter, Chu Feng opened his eyes and discovered that it was the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors that was laughing.<br>At that moment, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors was looking at Chu Feng and laughing heartily with both hands holding his belly and body convulsing. It was truly frantic laughter.<br>&ldquo;That fool is having a spasm. The hell is he laughing about?&rdquo; Eggy asked in a confused manner.<br>&ldquo;Something seems amiss,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s amiss?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;Look at everyone&rsquo;s reaction,&rdquo; Chu Feng said those words and turned his gaze to the crowd.<br>At that moment, Eggy noticed that the others were not laughing like the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors. However, their expressions had all changed.<br>If they had been filled with anticipation toward Chu Feng earlier, then their current expressions were filled with disappointment.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Three Swords, did you see that? That trash is unable to even form armor. He is not qualified to even enter this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, you actually placed your hope on trash like him to take care of me? Say, how ignorant could you be?&rdquo; The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors mocked Daoist Three Swords.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng is still in that spirit formation. He has not been sent out by it. How can you be so certain that he will not be able to form armor?&rdquo; Daoist Three Swords said.<br>&ldquo;Haha, whether he can or not is something that will be decided in an instant. He has already been in there for so long. Yet, he still hasn&rsquo;t condensed any armor. You think that he still has hope?&rdquo; The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng finally realized why the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors was laughing at him, and why the crowd had such an expression.<br>It turned out that they had already determined that he could not form any armor.<br>However, Chu Feng was not panicking. Only he knew that the spirit power was still assimilating into his body and transforming his body and power.<br>He had not failed. Merely, he needed time; he merely needed a bit more time than the others.<br>&ldquo;It seems that child&rsquo;s spirit power is truly pure. He is actually going to condense a suit of Dragon Marked Armor,&rdquo; Above the clouds, the Golden Crane True Immortal was looking down below with a shocked expression in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Golden True Immortal, you are truly one to slack off. Since you bothered to spend the time to set up that spirit formation, why didn&rsquo;t you do so properly? You made it so that the spirit power is insufficient, causing it to take so long to form a suit of Dragon Marked Armor,&rdquo; The plain clothed old monk said.<br>As a fellow Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, he had already seen through the fact that the Golden Crane True Immortal had not set up that spirit formation up diligently.<br>That was the reason why the process to condense Chu Feng&rsquo;s Dragon Marked Armor was taking so long, as the spirit formation did not possess a sufficient amount of spirit power.<br>It ended up leading the others to think that Chu Feng was unable to condense any armor at all.<br>&ldquo;How could I know that there would be someone capable of condensing Dragon Marked Armor?&rdquo; The Golden Crane True Immortal said.<br>Although both the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain clothed old monk knew the reason why Chu Feng had yet to condense any armor, the others did not.<br>The others had all already concluded that Chu Feng was unable to condense any armor because his spirit power was insufficiently pure.<br>&ldquo;What a bore. We four brothers will have taken the four spots this easily. This is truly too boring, and not challenging in the slightest. Can&rsquo;t you all give us some pressure?&rdquo; The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said with a sigh.<br>&ldquo;You have yet to occupy the last spot.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Daoist Three Swords unleashed his attack. It was not only him, Grandmaster Pocket also unleashed his attack. Evidently, the two of them did not want to hand the final spot over to the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors so easily.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste your time. You all can come at me together. The final spot for the comprehension formation is definitely mine,&rdquo; The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors declared.<br>&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; In response, the silver-armored Liu Xiaoli also unleashed her attacks.<br>She was trying to buy time for Chu Feng. Even though others all felt that Chu Feng had failed to forming any armor, Liu Xiaoli felt that Chu Feng would succeed.<br>In such a situation, more and more people began to attack the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors.<br>They all knew that even if they did not attack him, he would, sooner or later, attack them.<br>Rather than being defeated by him one by one, it would be better to assist Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket while they were still not defeated.<br>Perhaps they might be able to defeat the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors this way. This way, they would be able to beat down his arrogance.<br>However, things did not turn out the way they wanted. The eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors was truly too powerful. Although they were all wearing golden armor, his battle power was much stronger than Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket&rsquo;s.<br>&ldquo;Bang, bang, bang, bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Each and every punch from the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors brought forth thunderous sounds and enormous power capable of cutting through a mountain. Practically every punch from him would knock someone out, causing them to lose the ability to fight for a short period of time.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Three Swords, Grandmaster Pocket, I originally did not plan to injure the two of you. However, there&rsquo;s no other way around it. This is the rule set up by the Golden Crane True Immortal. Only by defeating the two of you will I be able to enter the comprehension formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, do not blame me for being too ruthless.&rdquo;<br>After defeating the others, the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors finally started to unleash attacks at Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket.<br>Although he had declared that he did not wish to harm them, he was attacking them with ferocious attacks. It was as if he was planning to kill Daoist Three Swords and Grandmaster Pocket.<br>&ldquo;Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Grandmaster Pocket was caught off guard, and received many punches from the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors.<br>After the punches landed, Grandmaster Pocket was knocked flying before ruthlessly crashing into the world spirit wall. When he fell to the ground, his complexion turned red, and blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Pocket is actually vomiting blood!!!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, the crowd were all shocked.<br>When the others had been defeated, they had not vomited blood.<br>However, Grandmaster Pocket was vomiting blood. This meant that the eldest of the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; attack toward Grandmaster Pocket had been stronger than his attacks toward the others. He was deliberately retaliating against Grandmaster Pocket.<br><br></p></div>
