        <h1>Chapter 988</h1>
        <div> - Before Departure<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Chu Feng did not refute Huangfu Haoyue&rsquo;s words. After all, he was very correct. If it weren&rsquo;t for Chu Feng, perhaps Huangfu Haoyue would have already died within the Heavenly Road. How would he live to see today?<br>Although he had gone insane for quite a long period of time and he had borne a few pains, he had gotten quite a few gains as well. As he said, amidst his madness, he simply knew nothing about cultivation. Yet, his cultivation had grown. Not only cultivation, even his comprehension strength had become stronger. These were his gains, and he knew where they came from.<br>Moreover, after experiencing such a suffering, he knew the most important thing in life was not cultivation. Even though he wished to become a Martial Emperor, he did not plan to enter the Holy Land of Martialism. Instead, he planned to stay in the Eastern Sea Region by Qiushui Fuyan&rsquo;s side.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I know you must go to the Heavenly Road. I simply cannot stop you, so I&rsquo;m not planning to stop you.<br>&ldquo;But that is truly a dangerous place. As such, I do not advise bringing Zi Ling and the others with you. You&rsquo;re different from them. You have a very strong willpower; you can pass through the Heavenly Road. However, that may not apply to them,&rdquo; Huangfu Haoyue recommended.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for your advice, senior. I&rsquo;ve already decided.&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded, then return to the Misty Peak with Huangfu Haoyue.<br>When he returned, Chu Feng called over Zi Ling, Su Rou, Su Mei, Jiang Wushang, and Zhang Tianyi.<br>However, when he looked at their faces brimming with smiles, Chu Feng found it a bit hard to speak. They all had their dreams and they didn&rsquo;t fear danger. They really<br>should<br>head to the Holy Land of Martialism, so Chu Feng truly didn&rsquo;t know how to convince them to stay.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s something I and Brother Wushang want to tell you,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi suddenly said. There was even a bit of an apologetic expression on his face.<br>&ldquo;Senior Zhang, just speak your mind,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng, I am truly sorry. We cannot accompany you to the Holy Land of Martialism,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi said remorsefully. Jiang Wushang&rsquo;s face was also a bit apologetic.<br>&ldquo;Senior Zhang, Brother Wushang, you mean&hellip;?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt a bit surprised at his words.<br>&ldquo;Big Brother Chu Feng, I know we brothers said we would face fortune and disaster together, but there&rsquo;s really too great of a difference between our cultivations. We don&rsquo;t want to be constantly on guard after entering the Holy Land of Martialism with you. We don&rsquo;t want to affect your future because of our helplessness.<br>&ldquo;So, we&rsquo;ve already discussed this with Sister Fuyan. She allowed me and Big Brother Tianyi to stay in the Misty Peak to cultivate. She&rsquo;ll also pass down the cultivation methods from the Misty Peak.<br>&ldquo;The Misty Peak is something from the Ancient Era. And since even Jiang Qisha and the others, who&rsquo;d come from the Holy Land of Martialism, expressed such desire for the Misty Peak, it shows how impressive it is. So, as we stay here and cultivate, our speed might not be slower than yours.. Perhaps one day, we will even catch up to you! When we feel that we won&rsquo;t be a burden, we&rsquo;ll go to the Holy Land of Martialism and search for you,&rdquo; Jiang Wushang said as he chuckled.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve truly decided?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Mm. Even you cannot sway our decision,&rdquo; said Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang together.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, we are also planning the same thing.&rdquo; Zi Ling suddenly spoke. Su Rou and Su Mei were holding Zi Ling&rsquo;s arms as they gave a sweet smile.<br>&ldquo;You are also planning to stay in the Misty Peak?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt even more surprised.<br>&ldquo;Mm. Although my Divine Body has been cured, the cultivation I have is still too weak. As he said, with the cultivation we have right now, it is truly too dangerous to enter the Holy Land of Martialism. It&rsquo;s better to stay here and strengthen ourselves first. When we acquire a certain amount of achievements in cultivation, we can always join up with you at that place.&rdquo; Zi Ling nodded.<br>Since even they&rsquo;d spoken, Chu Feng was a bit speechless. At that instant, he only felt a bit of reluctance to part. They had said they would enter the Holy Land of Martialism together, but now, he would go alone&mdash;again.<br>Without his lovers, his brothers, no matter how wonderful the new journey became, he&rsquo;d be lacking a portion of enjoyment and gaining a portion of sorrow.<br>However, this situation was one Chu Feng hoped for. Thus, there was not only unwillingness to separate in his heart, there was also gratitude. He was very thankful that they thought of him.<br>Chu Feng knew how much they hoped to come to the Holy Land of Martialism with him. However, precisely because they thought cared about Chu Feng so much, they gave up without Chu Feng even asking them to.<br>There were still a few days to the opening of the Heavenly Road. As such, Chu Feng was not in a rush to leave. Before leaving, there was a joyous event held in the Misty Peak&mdash;the marriage between Huangfu Haoyue and Qiushui Fuyan.<br>This wedding was not announced to the outside, nor was it overly grand. However, everyone who was there hoped the best for the two of them. It was a very warm moment, and before the wishes of the crowd, this pair of lovers would finally, once again, live and walk together.<br>Moreover, since Lady Piaomiao&rsquo;s cultivation was gone, she could no longer guard the Misty Peak. Thus, she handed down such a mission to Qiushui Fuyan and Huangfu Haoyue and had them guard this place together.<br>As for the Crippling Night Demon Sect, Chu Feng gave full authority to Qiu Canfeng. Although Chu Feng was going to leave, to the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect, he was eternally their sect head.<br>Finally, the day of the Heavenly Road&rsquo;s opening arrived. After passing the Heavenly Sea, they would reach the place where it opened.<br>This was something that happened every year, and every time, quite a few people would come to watch. Most of them didn&rsquo;t plan to enter the Heavenly Road; they came here just to give it a look.<br>However, this year, there was a lot more people than usual&mdash;several thousand times more. It was even much more lively than the year when the Burning Heaven Church headed to the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>Vast number of bodies filled the sky. It was a very grand scene to behold.<br>The reason for such an anomaly was because it was rumoured there would be a famous person who was going to enter this year&rsquo;s Heavenly Road.<br>The person who eradicated the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans, who killed Murong Mingtian, Jiang Qisha, and the others alone, the current head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s Chu Feng! He&rsquo;s truly come! It seems that he&rsquo;s preparing to enter the Heavenly Road this year,&rdquo; exclaimed someone amidst the crowd. Very soon, everyone cast their gazes in the direction he pointed. They could see a vast stream of people flying over slowly.<br>Everyone started feeling excited. Such an emotion permeated this land.<br>Within the immense sea of people, there were simply countless famous people from the Eastern Sea Region. However, at that very instant, the person who caught the most attention was a young person&mdash;Chu Feng.<br>He was riding a flying horse. He was so full of spirit. He was so young.<br>On his face that wasn&rsquo;t really all that handsome yet was filled with resolution, there was a confident and dazzling smile.<br>To his left were Su Rou, Su Mei, and Zi Ling. To his right were Jiang Wushang, Zhang Tianyi, and the Chu family.<br>As for behind him, Lady Piaomiao, Qiushui Fuyan, Huangfu Haoyue, Qiu Canfeng, Xue Xiyue, and the many peak experts from the Crippling Night Demon Sect were there.<br>However, without a single trace of doubt, amongst all these famous people, Chu Feng was the focus.<br></p></div>
