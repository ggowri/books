        <div> - Recognize One&rsquo;s Mistake And Be Able To Reform Oneself<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Milords, there were indeed people that snuck into the World Spirit Mansion Gate through cheating. Furthermore, there were eleven of them. Of those eleven, one was an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, and ten were Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But Lord Asura is truly a person of the younger generation. We personally witnessed things ourselves, and can testify for him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milords, I am willing to vouch with my life that Lord Asura is a person of the younger generation.&rdquo;<br>The people of the younger generations were all speaking out for Chu Feng. As they all spoke at once, they revealed everything that they had witnessed.<br>Furthermore, they also revealed something else: Chu Feng was an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>&ldquo;He really is a person of the younger generation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A person of the younger generation is able to become an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>Upon learning of Chu Feng being an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, the crowd that had started to believe Chu Feng to be a person of the younger generation started growing skeptical again.<br>The reason for that was all because the status of an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist was simply too dazzling.<br>After all, the amount of Saint-cloak World Spiritists in their All-heaven Starfield could be counted.<br>As for a person of the younger generation becoming an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, that was simply unheard of.<br>&ldquo;Clamor~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the chains that tied Chu Feng suddenly came undone.<br>It was Lord White Gown.<br>The crowd were able to see that Lord White Gown was holding a title plate in his hand. It was that title plate that controlled the power of the World Spirit Mansion Gate&rsquo;s formation core.<br>It was also because he possessed that title plate that he was able to use such a powerful spirit formation to tie up Chu Feng and forcibly bring him out of the World Spirit Mansion Gate.<br>After he used the power of the title plate to remove the chains from Chu Feng, the title plate started to shine with light. A spirit formation ring of light appeared before Chu Feng.<br>Before Chu Feng could move, that right of light swept past him.<br>After that ring of light swept past Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, Lord White Gown&rsquo;s expression became complicated.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, this old man has wrongly accused you.&rdquo; Suddenly, Lord White Gown bowed respectfully to Chu Feng.<br>Once Lord White Gown did that, the crowd&rsquo;s heart all tensed up. Their expressions became complicated, and shock appeared in their eyes.<br>They knew that Lord White Gown had already verified Chu Feng&rsquo;s status as a person of the younger generation.<br>Lord White Gown&rsquo;s apology had also revealed to the crowd the result of his verification process.<br>That young man was indeed a person of the younger generation, and Lord White Gown had truly wrongly accused him earlier.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng showed contempt and disdain towards Lord White Gown&rsquo;s apology.<br>To be publicly accused, Chu Feng was unwilling to let matters go with a mere apology.<br>However, right at that moment, Lord White Gown raised his hand and thrust it toward his dantian.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>Blood splashed forth. That Lord White Gown had pierced his dantian with his own hand.<br>At that moment, the Seven Suns Mountain Range&rsquo;s guardians all rushed to Lord White Gown with panic on their faces.<br>As for Chu Feng, his expression had also changed.<br>Even though that Lord White Gown&rsquo;s hand had not thrust into his dantian completely, it remained that he had trust it into his dantian.<br>Even if his cultivation would not decrease too much, it would still suffer damage.<br>This punishment was not light at all.<br>After all, to martial cultivators, cultivation was the most important thing.<br>For that Lord White Gown to be willing to punish himself in such a manner, how could Chu Feng not be shocked?<br>&ldquo;This old man is incompetent, and has wrongly accused young friend.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Only by wounding myself could this old man alleviate the guilt that he has for young friend.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend, if you want to punish this old man, please speak without any hesitation. This old man will definitely do as you say.&rdquo;<br>After injuring himself, Lord White Gown&rsquo;s loud and resonating voice sounded throughout the plaza.<br>Merely, this time around, his voice was filled with shame and self-blame.<br>Even though his voice was still very loud and resounding, there was no trace of arrogance. Instead, it was extremely humble.<br>&ldquo;Forget about it. Senior, this is a trivial matter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, the most important thing would be to capture those cheaters," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Sigh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng said those words, Lord White Gown heaved a long sigh.<br>&ldquo;This old man is guilty. I missed the most optimal timing. Those real cheaters have already fled this place.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the crowd all came to a realization.<br>Since Lord White Gown was capable of controlling the power of the World Spirit Mansion Gate&rsquo;s formation core, he would most definitely be able to inspect the situation inside.<br>Likely, there was no one inside the World Spirit Mansion Gate now. This meant that those cheaters had escaped the World Spirit Mansion Gate.<br>However, they did not detect how those people had escaped. This meant that they had missed the optimal opportunity to capture them.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng suddenly grew tense. He realized that those eleven world spiritists seemed to be much stronger than he had imagined.<br>To be able to escape from Lord White Gown even though he possessed the power of the formation core, their ability would be rather remarkable.<br>&ldquo;Be careful. Those people might try to retaliate against you.&rdquo;<br>A voice entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears. It was Yu Sha.<br>Yu Sha had also decided those eleven world spiritists to be remarkable, and spoke to warn Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Girl, are you worried about me? Not bad. You&rsquo;ve made progress. You now know how to worry for your master,&rdquo; teased Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s teasing was met with Yu Sha&rsquo;s cold indifference. She actually decided to ignore him.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, if it&rsquo;s a blessing, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a calamity. If it is a calamity, I won&rsquo;t be able to avoid it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since I, Chu Feng, dared to provoke them, I do not fear their retaliation.&rdquo;<br>Although Yu Sha had decided to ignore Chu Feng, Chu Feng spoke to her again.<br>Chu Feng was not trying to show off his confidence. He was instead trying to reassure Yu Sha.<br>He was indirectly telling her that even if the eleven world spiritists came to cause trouble for him, he, Chu Feng, still did not fear them.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, I am truly ashamed to have wrongly accused you. I hope that young friend will not blame me.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Lord White Gown arrived before Chu Feng with the Seven Suns Mountain Range&rsquo;s guardians.<br>The guardians that had been shouting and calling for him to be severely punished earlier all had looks of shame on their faces like Lord White Gown. One by one, they apologized to Chu Feng.<br>Seeing the attitudes of those people, Chu Feng&rsquo;s impression of them changed somewhat.<br>People shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of making mistakes as long as they dared to admit their mistakes, and reform themselves.<br>The guardians of the Seven Suns Mountain Range were evidently not of the shameless kind.<br>At the very least, they were able to recognize their mistakes, and possessed the courage to admit fault.<br>This meant that they were not shameless. Instead, they were just hot-tempered.<br>&ldquo;Milord, are you really an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, another voice was heard. It was a spectator from the crowd. Furthermore, that person was a person of the younger generation.<br>He was simply too curious to know if Chu Feng was really an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>After that person spoke, Chu Feng was met with expectant gazes from all around.<br>Evidently, that person had voiced the question in everyone&rsquo;s hearts. The crowd all wanted to know if Chu Feng was really an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br></p></div>
