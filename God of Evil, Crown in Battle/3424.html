        <h1>Chapter 3423</h1>
        <div> - Brainless<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Sure enough, the one who became our Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist is Hongfei!&rdquo;<br>Seeing the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak descending toward Linghu Hongfei, the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations all became endlessly excited. Unable to contain themselves, they reacted with unrestrained emotions, as if they were waiting to witness the arrival of a historic moment.<br>However, Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others revealed surprised looks on their faces.<br>The way they saw it, the person who had breached the formation was Chu Feng. Thus, the person who would obtain the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak should be Chu Feng.<br>Thus, why would the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak be floating toward Linghu Hongfei?!!!<br>Could it be that some sort of unforeseen event had happened afterwards?<br>Could it be that the person who had breached the grand formation was Linghu Hongfei instead of Chu Feng?<br>In fact, it was not only Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others who were surprised; even Linghu Hongfei was very surprised.<br>Compared to Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others, Linghu Hongfei himself knew very well that the final victor in the grand formation was Chu Feng, and not himself.<br>As such, he did not understand why the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was floating toward him, and not Chu Feng.<br>The speed at which the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak descended was very slow. The closer it approached, the slower its speed became.<br>The slower the speed of descent was, the more nervous the crowd became. This was especially true for Linghu Hongfei. Although he was always a calm and unflustered person, he was actually unable to contain his emotions at that moment.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here? Could it be that even though it was Chu Feng who obtained the power, it was instead me who was acknowledged by the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That must be the case. It would appear that I haven&rsquo;t lost yet. I haven&rsquo;t lost yet.&rdquo;<br>In the beginning, he was skeptical. However, as the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak grew closer and closer, Linghu Hongfei became practically certain that it was coming toward him.<br>Because of that, he became particularly excited.<br>Even if he failed to become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, if he were to obtain the acknowledgement of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, he would obtain honor not at all inferior to becoming a Saint-cloak World Spiritist. In fact, people would feel even greater admiration and envy toward him.<br>After all, that was&hellip; one of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s three remaining Great Eccentrics&rsquo; Remnants.<br>Oh how great of an honor it would be to have been able to breach an Eccentric&rsquo;s Remnant.<br>However, after the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak descended before Linghu Hongfei, it did not stop. Instead, it flew past him, and floated towards Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;God damn it!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even you dared to toy with me!!!&rdquo;<br>Linghu Hongfei came to a sudden realization upon witnessing that scene. It turned out that the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was toying with him.<br>This caused Linghu Hongfei, who was originally filled with endless excitement, to once again fall into an abyss of pain and suffering, making him feel particularly uncomfortable and displeased.<br>Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s heart was already driven mad with anger. However, on the surface, he still maintained a completely unaffected expression. This was what brought the greatest suffering to him.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?&rdquo;<br>Linghu Tiemian and the others who did not know the truth of the matter were even more confused upon seeing that.<br>The way they saw it, the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak belonged to none other than Linghu Hongfei. There could only be one possible explanation if the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak didn&rsquo;t belong to Linghu Hongfei&hellip; someone was cheating!!!<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what sort of despicable and shameless trick have you used to lure the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak over to you?!&rdquo; Firmly believing that the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak belonged to Linghu Hongfei, Linghu Tiemian actually lashed out at Chu Feng.<br>He was convinced, that Chu Feng had used despicable means to make the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak float towards him instead.<br>However, Chu Feng simply ignored Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s criticism and call to question.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s attention had been caught by the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.<br>It was not only his gaze that was captured by it. At that moment, the power within Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, the power he had obtained from the hidden path, and the power he had obtained from the assimilation of the black gaseous flames were all reacting.<br>To Chu Feng, what was approaching him was not merely a world spiritist cloak. Instead, it was more like a strong power that was planning to assimilate with him.<br>No, it wasn&rsquo;t like a strong power, because the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak really did contain an enormous power within it!!!<br>&ldquo;Shameless and despicable bastard! Never have I, Linghu Tiemian, met someone as shameless as you!&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng had ignored him and was waiting for the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak to approach him with a look of anticipation, Linghu Tiemian was immediately enraged. He began to walk toward Chu Feng aggressively. From his appearance, he seemed to want to attack Chu Feng.<br>It was not only Linghu Tiemian. Apart from Linghu Hongfei and Linghu Yueyue, all of the other Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations began to approach Chu Feng aggressively.<br>&ldquo;What are you all trying to do?&rdquo; Seeing that, Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s body shifted, and blocked their path.<br>&ldquo;Step aside! This matter has nothing to do with you!&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian said.<br>&ldquo;Your business has nothing to do with me. However, his business is my business,&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s face became increasingly cold. She seemed to be indicating that she would become impolite should they dare to do anything reckless.<br>&ldquo;Could you not tell that the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was planning to recognize Linghu Hongfei as its master? It was that Chu Feng who used despicable means to lure the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak over to him!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I cannot allow that Chu Feng to snatch away the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak! It does not belong to him!&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian said.<br>&ldquo;Snatch away?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What did you think the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak to be? Did you think that it was a fish that could be lured with bait?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak! If it were something that could be obtained so easily, snatched away so easily, how could it remain in the grand formation for so many years, unobtained?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie sneered.<br>&ldquo;What Wuma Shengjie says is very correct. Say, Linghu Tiemian, are you really that brainless?&rdquo; Even Liangqiu Hongyue stood forth.<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng grasped some sort of power that allowed him to move about unrestrained in the grand formation. It&rsquo;s not strange at all that he could control the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak,&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian spoke coldly.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Chu Feng did do some unimaginable things.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that he really used that power to forcibly snatch away the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak that should belong to Linghu Hongfei?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, it would simply be too excessive!&rdquo;<br>Hearing Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s words, there were actually many people that felt that it made a lot of sense.<br>At that moment, many people began to feel that Chu Feng was in the wrong.<br>&ldquo;Excuse this old man for speaking forthrightly. Even if it&rsquo;s through the use of some sort of special power, that&rsquo;s still young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s personal capability.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If someone refuses to accept it, they can very well go and try to snatch away the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak. If anyone can snatch it away, it would belong to them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I must warn you all beforehand. If some sort of accident is to occur, you all shall bear the responsibility for your own actions,&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan spoke coldly. Even he was unable to tolerate Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s behavior anymore.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, you&rsquo;re the one who said that,&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian snorted coldly. Then, his body shifted. He leaped past Wuma Shengjie and flew toward the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.<br>Actually, Wuma Shengjie could stop him. However, she did not stop him this time around.<br>After Grandmaster Long Xuan spoke, she had realized that it was not that easy to snatch away the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak. If Linghu Tiemian insisted on trying, he would only bring suffering upon himself.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, when Linghu Tiemian touched the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, he was immediately set ablaze. Then, a miserable scream was heard.<br>Seeing that, Linghu Hongfei and the others immediately rushed toward him.<br>However, Linghu Tiemian was already covered in flames. They simply did not dare to approach him.<br>&ldquo;Step aside!&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu approached and waved his sleeve. Finally, the flames were extinguished. However, Linghu Tiemian was completely scorched, and his aura very weak.<br>His injury was much more serious than the injury Queen Mother Fox Immortal had sustained earlier!!!<br>&ldquo;This!!!&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all deeply frightened upon witnessing that. Sure enough, the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was not something that one could seize at will. Even if it had descended from midair by itself, one still could not act blasphemously toward it.<br>&ldquo;Linghu Tiemian, turns out you really are brainless.&rdquo;<br>Seeing Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s tragic look, Liangqiu Hongyue showed no signs of sympathy, and looked at him like she was looking at a fool.<br></p></div>
