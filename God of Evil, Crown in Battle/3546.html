        <h1>Chapter 3545</h1>
        <div> - The Holy Land In Trouble<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, your aura from earlier&hellip; if this old man isn&rsquo;t mistaken, it seemed to be&hellip; of the Exalted realm?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that young master Chu Feng is now an Exalted?&rdquo;<br>Once Elder Xing Yi asked that question, even the surrounding air grew quiet.<br>The Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s renowned Starfall Eight Immortals were all holding their breaths and staring at Chu Feng with distorted expressions. They were all waiting for his answer.<br>They seemed to have prepared themselves...<br>&ldquo;Rank one Exalted,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Sssss~~~&rdquo;<br>The Starfall Eight Immortals all sucked in a mouthful of cold air upon hearing that response. Even though they were already prepared for it, their hearts still ended up surging with an enormous wave upon hearing the answer from Chu Feng&rsquo;s mouth. This wave surging in their hearts was so violent that it instantly engulfed their entire bodies, causing even their blood to boil.<br>Rank one Exalted. That was a cultivation that their Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master took three thousand years to reach.<br>Yet, Chu Feng was actually able to become a rank one Exalted in such a short period of time.<br>One must know that when the Starfall Eight Immortals first met Chu Feng, he was merely a rank one True Immortal.<br>It had only been a very short period of time since then. Yet, Chu Feng had already made consecutive breakthroughs from the True Immortal realm to the Heavenly Immortal realm to the Martial Immortal realm to the Exalted realm, crossing over three major realms and reaching a level of cultivation that they would never reach in their entire lifetimes.<br>Thus, the fact that they could remain unfazed after learning this news meant that their ability to accept shock was already very strong.<br>&ldquo;As expected of Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; suddenly, Elder Xing Yi gasped with admiration.<br>His words brought the others back from their shocked state. They who originally found it difficult to accept were now able to accept the shock a bit more.<br>Chu Xuanyuan, that demon-level existence, had done things that were impossible for ordinary people with his extraordinary talent. He continuously smashed through the crowd&rsquo;s common sense, and continued to shocked them repeatedly. It was only through that, that he became famous throughout the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>As for Chu Feng, since he was Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, it was actually reasonable for him to have succeeded Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s talent, and be able to accomplish unbelievable things.<br>&ldquo;With such a distinguished father, the son surely will not disappoint,&rdquo; the other elders also gasped with admiration.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, do you all know who those people might be?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked that because he felt that it was very likely that those black-cloaked individuals were the same group of people from the mysterious power that had entered the Void Sacred Tree the instant it opened up.<br>Chu Feng was very much on the alert towards this group of people.<br>Chu Feng had a guess in mind. He felt that, compared to them, that group of mysterious people might know the Void Sacred Tree even better.<br>Furthermore, those people earlier, upon discovering that they were no match for Chu Feng, immediately decided to commit suicide through self-detonation. That made it completely clear that they held secrets.<br>It was precisely because they did not wish to expose their secrets that they chose to commit suicide through self-detonation.<br>Life was such a precious thing. Yet, those people were willing to commit suicide just so that they did not reveal their secrets. Their resolution was simply terrifying.<br>Faced with such a formidable opponent, Chu Feng simply could not afford to be careless.<br>&ldquo;We also do not know who they are, or the reason why they wanted to capture us,&rdquo; Elder Xing Er shook his head.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng started to frown.<br>In a battle between two armies, the most terrifying thing was for one to be in the open, and for one&rsquo;s enemy to be in the shadows.<br>This held especially true for their current situation, as it seemed like their enemy knew them very well, whereas they knew nothing about their enemy.<br>The current situation could be said to be extremely disadvantageous for them.<br>However, right at that moment, Elder Xing Yi said, &ldquo;Although I cannot be certain, earlier, they self-detonated. It seemed like they might be&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, might be what?&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly asked.<br>&ldquo;The Blood-devouring Demon Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Blood-devouring Demon Clan?&rdquo;<br>Once Elder Xing Yi said those words, his seven brothers&rsquo; expressions immediately changed. The feeling of unease was completely present on their faces.<br>Although Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know what the Blood-devouring Demon Clan was, he was able to tell that they were most definitely not an ordinary group of people from the reactions of the Starfall Eight Immortals. Thus, he asked, &ldquo;Senior, what is the Blood-devouring Demon Clan?&rdquo;<br>The Starfall Eight Immortals began to inform Chu Feng about the matter regarding the Blood-devouring Demon Clan.<br>However, they all felt that the Blood-devouring Demon Clan had been completely exterminated, and should not have appeared there.<br>Thus, they simply did not dare to be certain that their guess was true. Instead, they felt it to be very outrageous.<br>&ldquo;I think that those people must be plotting something. They will definitely appear again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sooner or later, we'll be able to find out whether they&rsquo;re from the Blood-devouring Demon Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, facing a group like them, we must be extremely careful,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; the Starfall Eight Immortals nodded.<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Seniors, are you all the only ones that came in from the Starfall Holy Land? Why am I not seeing anyone else?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Crap, we nearly forgot about our mission because of that group of people. Young master Chu Feng, are you currently busy?&rdquo; Suddenly, Elder Xing Yi looked to Chu Feng with a nervous look.<br>&ldquo;I am currently separated from my clansmen and do not know where to find them. We can journey together,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s truly great. Let us start moving first. We&rsquo;ll explain the situation to you on the way,&rdquo; Elder Xing Yi said.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had agreed to it, Elder Xing Yi stretched his arm out of his sleeve. There was a piece of stone in his hand.<br>That stone was very special, and was emitting a faint light. Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that the stone was capable of guiding them.<br>&ldquo;Senior, allow me,&rdquo; Chu Feng extended his hand with the intention to take the stone from Elder Xing Yi.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell that the Starfall Eight Immortals should have an important mission to accomplish, and the stone was meant to guide them.<br>Amongst the nine of them, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was the highest. Thus, his speed was also the highest. It would henceforth be more suitable for him to lead the way.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, we&rsquo;ll trouble you then.&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, Elder Xing Yi did not reject Chu Feng&rsquo;s proposal at all. Instead, with a grateful expression, he handed the stone to him.<br>It could be seen that he had wanted Chu Feng to lead the way to begin with. The reason why he had asked if he was busy earlier was also because he hoped that Chu Feng could accompany them.<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng lead the Starfall Eight Immortals and began to proceed quickly according to the path indicated by the stone.<br>Whilst traveling, he learned about what had happened to the Starfall Holy Land.<br>It was very possible that the Starfall Holy Land was in trouble...<br></p></div>
