        <h1>Chapter 4481</h1>
        <div>: Sorry, I Came Late<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The appearance of the ravishing figure left everyone dazed for a brief moment. It was an extremely beautiful woman who had a unique charm to her.<br>She had blonde hair that shone radiantly beneath her sun. Her blue eyes seemed to reflect stars inside of them, giving her a spirited look.<br>However, what that stood out the most was her pointed ears.<br>&ldquo;Who is she? She&rsquo;s so beautiful&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Men that couldn&rsquo;t help but drool at her beauty, and women couldn&rsquo;t tear their eyes of admiration away from her. It was the kind of beauty that really captivated others.<br>However, there was no one who associated her with the princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>In terms of appearance, those from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan looked no different from ordinary humans, but this beautiful woman had special racial traits that distinguished her from ordinary humans.<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to Princess Miaomiao!&rdquo; the domineering princess spoke up once more to greet the beautiful woman.<br>&ldquo;Princess Miaomiao? Is she a princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan too?&rdquo;<br>It was only after hearing those words did everyone finally realize that the beautiful woman standing before them was indeed the other princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan that had left the others feeling deeply intimidated.<br>It was just a little baffling why she would have such a peculiar appearance.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Princess Miaomiao asked that domineering princess.<br>The crowd was surprised to hear that question. Despite the two of them being from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, Princess Miaomiao actually didn&rsquo;t know that domineering princess?<br>This also made them realize that there was a greater disparity in their standings than they had previously thought. Otherwise, it would make perfectly no sense for Princess Miaomiao not to know the domineering princess.<br>But thinking about it again, it wasn&rsquo;t entirely impossible. The Nine Souls Sacred Clan was a massive clan with many offspring, and nearly every single one of them was highly-esteemed individuals in the Nine Souls Galaxy.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t just the daughter of the clan chief that was addressed as &lsquo;princess&rsquo;. Most of the daughters of notable standing within the Nine Souls Sacred Clan were addressed as &lsquo;princess&rsquo; by outsiders as well. As a result of that, there were a lot of princesses within the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>Of course, it went without saying that even though they might be addressed in the same manner, there could a huge disparity in their standing, and that was clearly the case between Princess Miaomiao and the domineering princess.<br>&ldquo;Princess Miaomiao, I am Jiuhun Youuyou. My father is a general within the clan,&rdquo; the domineering princess spoke with her head lowered humbly.<br>Her current attitude was vastly different from before. She was so subservient that it looked almost as if she was a servant standing before her master.<br>&ldquo;What grudge do you have with this man that you intend to use such a cruel method to torture him?&rdquo; Princess Miaomiao asked.<br>&ldquo;Your Highness, the punishment I have meted out to him is justified. This scoundrel has shown blatant insolence toward our Nine Souls Sacred Clan&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Princess Youyou began to explain the matter to Princess Miaomiao, but it went without saying that a huge chunk of the truth was distorted to her advantage. She made it seem as if she was on the side of justice, and Chu Feng was a reprehensible criminal who deserved to die thousand times over.<br>Everyone present knew that Princess Youyou was lying, but no one dared to step forward to expose her, not even the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others.<br>Given that Princess Miaomiao and Princess Youyou were both from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, it simply didn&rsquo;t seem likely for them to turn against one another over a mere outsider.<br>There were only two people who would dare to speak up in this situation, and they were Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao. However, Chu Feng had nearly lost his consciousness after the torture he had been through, and Long Xiaoxiao was suppressed tightly to the ground, such that she couldn&rsquo;t even speak at all.<br>&ldquo;Kill him and be done with it. There&rsquo;s no need to torture him,&rdquo; Princess Miaomiao ordered with a slight frown of disapproval.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Princess Miaomiao&rsquo;s words ring true. I have acted out of place, and I&rsquo;ll take note of it in the future,&rdquo; Princess Youyou heaved a sigh of relief internally as she replied.<br>From the nervous look on her face, it could be seen that she was very frightened of getting on Princess Miaomiao&rsquo;s bad side. Nevertheless, when she saw that her acting had managed to receive the latter, she couldn&rsquo;t the corners of her lips from curling upward in glee.<br>On the other hand, after hearing Princess Miaomiao&rsquo;s verdict, the faces of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others withered like a deflated balloon. They knew that Princess Miaomiao had proclaimed Chu Feng&rsquo;s death, and there was no longer anything they could do to stop it.<br>It was all over.<br>Wuu!<br>But at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly released a slight groan.<br>As his consciousness grew fainter and fainter, his control over his body weakened, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but groan from the sheer pain he was in. The injuries he had sustained were way beyond what an ordinary cultivator would have been able to endure, after all.<br>&ldquo;That voice?&rdquo;<br>It was just a slight groan, but it caused astonishment to ripple within Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s eyes.<br>She quickly rushed over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s sight and took a good look at him. Her face was completely unreadable as she assessed Chu Feng from head-to-toe. No one could tell what she was thinking at all.<br>She stretched her hand forth slowly, seemingly intending to touch Chu Feng yet hesitating over it at the same time.<br>&ldquo;Princess Miaomiao, you mustn&rsquo;t get close to him. He&rsquo;s an extremely dangerous person!&rdquo; Princess Youyou exclaimed.<br>However, Princess Miaomiao didn&rsquo;t pay her any heed. She continued looking at Chu Feng silent.<br>Wuuu!<br>Chu Feng let out a pained groan once more, and Princess Miaomiao seemed to shudder in response to it. It was almost as if she had recalled something.<br>Her earlier hesitation was dispelled, and she placed her pristine hand gently on Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodied cheek.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was ravaged to the point that he was barely a little more than a mishmash of flesh and blood, but his eyes were still intact. It was just that his eyes had barely any spirit in them.<br>His eyes were open, but they were unable to process anything around him anymore. It was his final persistence that he forced himself to keep his eyes open.<br>It was such a pair of spiritless eyes that left Princess Miaomiao dazed. She stood on the spot as if a statue, staring deeply at Chu Feng.<br>A moment passed, and her body began to tremble. It was inconspicuous at the start, but it became more and more apparent, as if reflecting the hurricane of emotions that was growing within her heart.<br>Even her lips had begun quivering.<br>Tears suddenly began flowing down her cheeks like a creek. Her emotions were gradually becoming more and more agitated, that one could almost hear her rapid breathing.<br>She was in great pain, but it wasn&rsquo;t the only emotion she was feeling. More than that, she was enraged.<br>&ldquo;Miaomiao, what happened?&rdquo;<br>Noticing that there was something amiss with the situation, two elders flew out of the war chariot over to her side. One of them was an elderly lady, and the other one was a black-haired old man.<br>Both of them were of short stature, and they looked unbearably thin, almost like matchsticks. If one were to just look at their outer appearance, it would be hard to think of them as anyone more than the common populace.<br>Yet, the atmosphere in the air changed along with their entry.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t their oppressive might but the disposition they commanded. It was a powerful presence that immediately commanded the submission of others.<br>Upon seeing these two elders, Princess Youyou and the others hurriedly kneeled to the floor once more and exclaimed, &ldquo;Paying respects to Lord Supreme Elders!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What? Supreme Elders? Are those two Supreme Elders of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan?&rdquo;<br>This revelation jolted the hearts of the onlookers.<br>The Supreme Elders of the lofty Nine Souls Sacred Clan were no different from deities to them. These were people that stood at the very top of the Nine Souls Galaxy, people whom the common cultivator would never be able to meet in their lifetime!<br>They never thought that they would meet two of them on this very day.<br>These two Supreme Elders paid no heed to Princess Youyou and her subordinates at all. Instead, they headed straight to Princess Miaomiao&rsquo;s side.<br>&ldquo;Miaomiao, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; the elderly lady asked worriedly.<br>&ldquo;Kill them,&rdquo; Princess Miaomiao spoke.<br>Her voice wasn&rsquo;t loud, but everyone could hear her words clearly.<br>&ldquo;Kill who?&rdquo; the black-haired old man asked.<br>Princess Miaomiao pointed to Princess Youyou and her subordinates and spoke with a shaking voice, &ldquo;Kill them. Kill all of them.!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>Those words shocked everyone present. Even the two Supreme Elders were a little taken aback as well.<br>&ldquo;Your Highness, please have mercy on me!&rdquo;<br>Princess Youyou had no idea why Princess Miaomiao wanted to kill her, but she immediately kneeled to the ground out of fright and begged for mercy.<br>No one was able to figure out what was happening at the moment. Why would Princess Miaomiao suddenly order for the death of Princess Youyou?<br>This was incomprehensible!<br>On the other hand, the two Supreme Elders didn&rsquo;t appear to be too fazed by Princess Miaomiao&rsquo;s sudden order.<br>&ldquo;Miaomiao, are you certain?&rdquo; the elderly lady asked.<br>&ldquo;Do you not hear my words? I said kill them! Have all of them killed!&rdquo; Princess Miaomiao roared in fury.<br>Her hoarse voice fully conveyed the burning rage within her, and veins were actually popping from her temples.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>It was bizarre that Princess Miaomiao would order for the death of her own clan member, not to mention that Princess Youyou&rsquo;s father was a general of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>The crowd couldn&rsquo;t make sense of this situation at all.<br>Pu!<br>Pu!<br>Pu!<br>Pu!<br>In the next instant, dull thuds sounded one after another.<br>Princess Youyou and her subordinates, including the powerful white-haired elder, exploded on the spot, splattering crimson blood all over the land.<br>Even the warship in the sky was reduced to dust amidst a deafening explosion.<br>It was the doing of the elderly lady. All she did was to raise her hand slightly, and the job was already all done. Throughout it all, there was not the slightest expression that could be seen on her face.<br>She actually killed her own clan members without any hesitation at all!<br>But how did this happen? Why would Princess Miaomiao suddenly change her mind all of a sudden?<br>It was at this moment that Princess Miaomiao suddenly turned around and hugged Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;<br>&ldquo;It was all my fault. I came too late. I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Holding Chu Feng in her grasp, she cried out loud as she muttered her apologies again and again.<br>This sight caused the lower jaws of the crowd to fall to the ground.<br>It was only at this moment that the crowd realized that the reason why Princess Miaomiao had gone to the extent of massacring her own clan members was all due to Chu Feng!<br></p></div>
