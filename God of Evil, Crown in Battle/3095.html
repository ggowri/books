        <div> - Old Ancestor&rsquo;s Final Wish<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Ever since our Chu Heavenly Clan emerged from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, we have ruled over the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm for many years now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To the people of the Lower and Ordinary Realms, our Chu Heavenly Clan has managed to make enormous accomplishments.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, our clan should not be stuck where it currently stands. We should not only be reaping the benefits of our Old Ancestor&rsquo;s accomplishments, and be satisfied with only guarding the world our Old Ancestor conquered.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is not what our Old Ancestor desired. Our Old Ancestor desired for our Chu Heavenly Clan to become the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Old Ancestor desired for the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield to be at peace, to flourish and become stronger.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;His desire was most definitely not endless internal unrest, and to be viewed as meat by others, and be humiliated by others.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Old Ancestor wished that in the future, anyone from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, regardless of whether they were from Ordinary Realms or even Lower Realms, would be respected by others the moment they mentioned that they were from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, something like that is very difficult to accomplish. Not even our Old Ancestor managed to accomplish it. Because of that, it became our Old Ancestor&rsquo;s final wish.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have tried to realize our Old Ancestor&rsquo;s final wish. Your grandfather also tried to realize it. However, our greatest obstruction presently is not our cultivations, but rather the Starfield Master Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Starfield Master Realm is extremely incompetent and feeble against outsiders. They have been humiliated by the surrounding starfields on many occasions, and never once did they dare to fight back.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is their incompetence that caused our Ancestral Martial Starfield to hold an extremely low status in the entire Holy Light Galaxy, and become the object of ridicule for other starfields.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, whilst the Starfield Master Realm is extremely incompetent and cowardly toward others, they are extremely domineering against the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They have refused to allow anyone or any power to threaten their status. If anyone should threaten their status, they will immediately suppress them, and will even go as far as to massacre their entire clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tragedies of powerful clans being completely massacred in a single night have happened multiple times in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All the intelligent people know that the culprit behind those massacres was the ruler of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the Starfield Master Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truth be told, back then, the Starfield Master Realm sent assassins to your grandfather in an attempt to kill him. Although he survived, he was seriously injured, and forced to leave the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Snap~~~&rdquo;<br>After hearing those words, Chu Feng clenched his fists tightly. Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing intent, which had already filled the entire palace, grew even more intense.<br>He had only known that the Starfield Master Realm had tried to suppress his grandfather and father. He had never thought that they had actually attempted to assassinate his grandfather.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng began to suspect whether his grandfather&rsquo;s disappearance had anything to do with the Starfield Master Realm. He began to worry that his grandfather had been killed by the Starfield Master Realm.<br>&ldquo;It was not only your grandfather. I too sensed the ill-intentions from the Starfield Master Realm, and ended up having no choice but to leave. During the days that I was gone, the Chu Heavenly Clan was secretly monitored by the Starfield Master Realm the entire time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Chu Heavenly Clan at that time was akin to hostages. They were firmly in the grasp of the Starfield Master Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They were afraid that I would threaten them on my return. Because of that, they planned to use the entire Chu Heavenly Clan to threaten me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I dared to make any moves that might threaten them upon my return, if I dared to do anything that exceeded their control, they would immediately massacre the entire Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, after I returned to the Ancestral Martial Starfield with you, I deliberately sought out a chance to fight them, and deliberately lost to them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was only because I was defeated by them that they lowered their guard. As for what happened afterwards, I believe you already know about it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, Feng&rsquo;er, there is one thing that you must know. I did not humiliate myself to have the Starfield Master Realm lower their guard against and remove the monitor over our Chu Heavenly Clan because I feared them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, your father, have never feared a single opponent in my entire life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I want to save your mother.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, I cannot wage war against the Starfield Master Realm. At the very least, I cannot do so at this time. Otherwise, if this matter is to spread and catch the attention of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, it might end up exposing our identities.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for now, I have something even more important that I must do. As such, I hope that you, my son, I hope that you, Feng&rsquo;er, will be able to accomplish our Old Ancestor&rsquo;s final wish.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you must remember this. Defeating the Starfield Master Realm and having our Chu Heavenly Clan rule over the Ancestral Martial Starfield is definitely not for ambition. Nor is it for the status of our Chu Heavenly Clan. More than anything, it is for the sake of the people of our Ancestral Martial Starfield. That was the desire of our Old Ancestor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Feng&rsquo;er, father knew that you initially tried so hard at martial cultivation for the sake of proving yourself. Later on, you tried so hard for the sake of protecting your family and friends.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the aspirations of a martial cultivator should not end with only these. With great power comes great responsibility; the greater the power you possess, the more you should use that power to do right.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Starfield Master Realm is already filled with chaos. Not to mention guarding the Ancestral Martial Starfield and keeping order in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the people of the Starfield Master Realm are secretly doing shameful things in the dark. Everything is for their own self-interest now. They do not care about the lives and deaths of others, and would even go so far as to bring harm upon the people living in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If they are allowed to continue to rule over the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the Ancestral Martial Starfield will one day be ruined by their hands. As such, it is time to replace them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, that path is a very difficult one. The Starfield Master Realm will not allow others to threaten their status. When you expose your edge, you will become a thorn in their side.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As such, the path to overthrow them could be said to be filled with dangers. You will be traveling alongside the grim reaper. Feng&rsquo;er, are you willing to walk this path?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you willing to fulfill the final wish of our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Old Ancestor that both your father and grandfather failed to fulfill?&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Father, I am willing. I will definitely do this. I will definitely overthrow the Starfield Master Realm. For you, for grandfather, for Old Ancestor, for the people of our Chu Heavenly Clan, and for the the people of our Ancestral Martial Starfield, I am willing.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice was very powerful and resounding. One could tell how determined Chu Feng was from his voice.<br>Chu Feng was most definitely not saying those words for the sake of saying them. He was really prepared to bring trouble to the Starfield Master Realm.<br>Actually, Chu Feng had already made this decision before returning to see his father.<br>Chu Feng would absolutely not allow a power that tried to assassinate his grandfather and forced both his father and grandfather out of the Ancestral Martial Starfield to continue their tyrannical rule over the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Moreover, Chu Feng felt what his father said to be very true.<br>Apart from preserving their own status, the Starfield Master Realm simply did not care about the lives and deaths of other Upper Realms anymore. Otherwise, why would the opening of Upper Realm Gates in the Ancestral Martial Starfield signify certain war?<br>As the overlord of the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, they refused to do what they should to maintain peace. A power like that should be overthrown.<br>Even if not for himself, Chu Feng would still do this for the sake of the people of the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s father suddenly smiled.<br>&ldquo;Actually, I am unable to hear your response. After all, this is only a formation, and not actually me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I know that my Feng&rsquo;er will definitely not disappoint me. After all, you are my son.&rdquo;<br>Chu Xuanyuan spoke with a smile on his face. His eyes were filled with high hopes.<br>Seeing such an expression in Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s eyes, Chu Feng felt as if his father were truly looking at him.<br>Thus, he vowed in his heart that he would definitely fulfill the final wishes of their Old Ancestor. Even if he had to go through water and walk through fire, he was still ready to bear all those dangers to accomplish it.<br>After all, this was not only their Old Ancestor&rsquo;s final wish, it was also his grandfather&rsquo;s wish and his father&rsquo;s wish.<br>And now, it had also become Chu Feng&rsquo;s wish.<br></p></div>
