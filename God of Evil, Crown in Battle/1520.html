        <div> - Return Politeness For Politeness<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Oh Chu Feng, you were too lenient earlier. For someone like him, there is no need to spare his life. You should&rsquo;ve just killed him. If something were to happen, I would have helped you assume all responsibility,&rdquo; Miao Renlong said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Chu Feng, what Elder Miao says is correct,&rdquo; The World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master added, &ldquo;while our World Spiritist Alliance does not go around provoking others, we do not fear them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For a disgrace as shameless as him, there is simply no need to spare his life.&rdquo;<br>Their words evidently told the crowd that not only was Chu Feng a disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain, he was also a disciple of their World Spiritist Alliance.<br>Not only would the Cyanwood Mountain stand behind Chu Feng, the World Spiritist Alliance would also do the same.<br>Two top-notch powers were both supporting Chu Feng and would even start a war for him. What sort of charisma was this?<br>At this moment, being reprimanded by these three grand characters, Xian Kun&rsquo;s earlier arrogance was completely gone. While he was very arrogant, Xian Kun was not a fool.<br>He knew what sorts of existences the people before him were. They were definitely not people that he, a mere member of the younger generation, could afford to provoke.<br>Furthermore, he also knew very well that even if they were to kill him today, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves would pay no heed to it. The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves would not start a war against both the Cyanwood Mountain and the World Spiritist Alliance for someone like him. It was not that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves were lacking dignity, but rather, it was because of three words: &lsquo;not worth it.&rsquo;<br>If he were still a genius in the Elf Kingdom, then perhaps the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves might really start a war against the Cyanwood Mountain for him. However, he had been banished from the Elf Kingdom. In other words, he had long since been abandoned by the Elf Kingdom. As such, the possibility of them starting a war for him was simply non-existent.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, this junior was merely joking around with Chu Feng earlier. What I said earlier was definitely not what I was actually thinking. Seniors, please, by all means, don&rsquo;t misunderstand.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Xian Kun kneeled to the ground with a &lsquo;putt&rsquo; and began to admit his mistake to Dugu Xingfeng and the others.<br>What Xian Kun was doing was equivalent to throwing away the final bit of dignity that he possessed. It was absolutely and utterly disgraceful.<br>However, he had no choice but to do what he did. That was because he was very afraid. The fear was coming from the bottom of his heart. He was able to tell from the attitudes of Dugu Xingfeng and the others that they cared deeply about Chu Feng.<br>If they were to become enraged and actually kill him, there would be nothing that he could do. Thus, although it was very shameful for him to kneel and admit his mistake, Xian Kun still chose to do it for the sake of saving his life.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, what Brother Xian Kun says is the truth. He is indeed not the sort of person that would be that unreasonable. Earlier, he was merely joking around with Brother Chu Feng. He most definitely did not plan to do anything with serious intentions.&rdquo;<br>Following Xian Kun, the other two Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves also kneeled to the ground and began to plead for Xian Kun.<br>However, they were rather unwilling to kneel. It could be seen that they did not want to help plead for Xian Kun from the bottoms of their hearts. After all, they were also able to tell that the situation was very disastrous. Thus, neither of them wished to be involved.<br>Yet, the two of them still kneeled down and started to plead for Xian Kun. There was only a single possibility as to why they were doing that. Likely, Xian Kun had secretly forced them to do so.<br>&ldquo;You three dogs still dare to continue babbling nonsense? Immediately scram from your daddy&rsquo;s line of sight! I do not wish to see people as filthy as you all continue to linger around.&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, Hong Qiang spoke. Compared to Dugu Xingfeng, the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong&rsquo;s threatening words, Hong Qiang was a lot more direct. As he spoke, he waved his sleeve and created a violent surge of wind that blew Xian Kun and the other two Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves toward the direction of the city gate like three houseflies.<br>Swift, decisive and incomparably tyrannical.<br>This scene deeply frightened all of the members of the younger generation present. How domineering was this person? He simply did not place the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves in his eyes at all.<br>However, although he was arrogant, he possessed the ability to be arrogant. That was because he was a peak Half Martial Emperor, a grand character on the same footing as the Yan Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>If Xian Kun and the other two Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves had not knelt and begged for forgiveness, they might really not only have been swept away. Instead, they might have ended up losing their lives here.<br>Upon thinking of this, the crowd all trembled with fear. One by one, they began to wipe away the cold sweat on their foreheads. At this time, the gazes with which they looked to Chu Feng had changed. From their earlier gazes of reverence, they were now gazes filled with fear.<br>Especially Tian Liang. At this moment, he was so frightened that his legs were starting to go soft. He was covered with cold sweat. If he knew that Chu Feng would be this powerful, that Chu Feng&rsquo;s backers would be this powerful, then, even if he was given ten guts, he would not have dared to continuously make things difficult for Chu Feng.<br>At this moment, Tian Liang was filled with lingering fear. With Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength and background, if Chu Feng wanted to do anything to him, even his master would not be able to save him.<br>With these people behind Chu Feng, who among the same generation would dare to provoke him? Likely, only geniuses like Yan Xie would be able to challenge Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, the Yan Clan&rsquo;s Ancestor has woken up. Follow us, we shall go and pay our respects to the Yan Clan&rsquo;s Ancestor together,&rdquo; Dugu Xingfeng said.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded. He then prepared to leave.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, please wait,&rdquo; Right at this moment, Yan Lei suddenly spoke.<br>Hearing that, Chu Feng stopped in his tracks, turned around and descended from the sky. He arrived before Yan Lei and asked, &ldquo;Brother Yan Lei, is there something you need?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you can take this back,&rdquo; Yan Lei handed the Infinity Edge back to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Yan Lei, what&rsquo;s wrong? Could it be that you do not want to make the exchange anymore?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Consider that ladle a gift. However, I cannot accept this Infinity Edge. The difference in value of these two items is simply too enormous. I cannot take such an advantage from you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you, I would not have been able to obtain that ladle anyways. It should be yours to begin with.&rdquo;<br>It was not that Yan Lei did not wish to keep that Infinity Edge. Rather, as he was the Yan Clan Clan Chief&rsquo;s son, he was a very fair and reasonable person. Furthermore, he was also very wise.<br>Chu Feng had displayed his talent. He was someone that could match up to Yan Xie. As long as there were no accidents, someone like Chu Feng would definitely become a very capable person in the future.<br>Yan Lei determined that he should not try to gain some cheap advantage only to lose out in the long run. Thus, he planned to present Chu Feng with a favor by gifting that ladle to Chu Feng for free.<br>&ldquo;Brother Yan Lei, you must not do this. We clearly declared that it was an exchange. How could I take this ladle for free, how could I make you suffer losses?&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head. He turned around and prepared to leave.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before Chu Feng could leave, Yan Lei grabbed onto Chu Feng&rsquo;s wrist and forcibly pushed the Infinity Edge into Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>With a very serious expression, Yan Lei said, &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you must accept this. If you accept it, we will still be brothers in the future. However, if you refuse, we shall break all ties today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Feng felt that the situation had become very difficult. He knew that Yan Lei would not really break all ties with him for something like this. He was merely trying to force him to accept the Infinity Edge.<br>&ldquo;Okay then. Brother Yan Lei, thank you very much for this gift. However, one should return politeness for politeness. Brother Yan Lei, I also have an item that I wish to give you.&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he received the Infinity Edge. At the same time, he took out a scroll from his Cosmos Sack. It was an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill.<br>Ever since Chu Feng had entered the Holy Land of Martialism, Chu Feng had killed quite a lot of people and obtained many treasures.<br>This Earthen Taboo Martial Skill was something that Chu Feng had obtained from the Cosmos Sack of a person he had killed. As this Martial Skill did not belong to any sect or school, it would not cause any conflict even if one were to learn it.<br>Thus, it was very suitable to gift this Earthen Taboo Martial Skill to Yan Lei.<br>After all, if it wasn&rsquo;t for Chu Feng taking out his Infinity Edge as an exchange for the ladle, Yan Lei would&rsquo;ve exchanged the ladle for Xian Kun&rsquo;s Earthen Taboo Martial Skill.<br>Thus, Chu Feng could not allow Yan Lei to come out empty-handed because of him. After all, he had managed to learn the Yan Clan&rsquo;s Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique because of Yan Lei.<br>To gift this Earthen Taboo Martial Skill to Yan Lei could be considered to be returning a favor. Only by doing this would Chu Feng be able to feel at ease.<br>&ldquo;In that case, thank you Brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Yan Lei did not refuse. He was able to tell that although Chu Feng&rsquo;s Earthen Taboo Martial Skill was inferior to his Earthen Taboo: Flame Sea Technique, it was still a pretty good Earthen Taboo Martial Skill.<br>After all, it was an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill. Even if it wasn&rsquo;t good, how bad could it be? Furthermore, Yan Lei was able to tell that Chu Feng was not willing to take advantage of him. Thus, he decided to calmly accept Chu Feng&rsquo;s Earthen Taboo Martial Skill.<br></p></div>
