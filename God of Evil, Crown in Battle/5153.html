        <h1>Chapter 5152</h1>
        <div>: Old Cat Shows Itself<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng had been wondering what the purpose of the long corridors was. There were no paintings or clues on them, making their existence extraneous. However, he now knew that the corridors were a special location.<br>Spirit power exerted in the corridor would receive significant enhancement corresponding to the amount of the ancient remnant&rsquo;s energy they had absorbed. The enhancement was incredible, to the extent where Chu Feng was able to casually conceal the key with a simple concealment formation despite not being able to do the same with the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.<br>If that was the case, Chu Feng possessed a decisive advantage here, considering how he had absorbed the greatest portion of the ancient remnant&rsquo;s energy. This meant that the formation he constructed here would be the strongest of all.<br>&ldquo;Why did Lord Zhenlong come up with such an arrangement?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured contemplatively.<br>A realization swiftly dawned on him.<br>&ldquo;I get it now. Lord Zhenlong only said that we weren&rsquo;t allowed to come to blows during the trials, but this corridor isn&rsquo;t considered to be a part of the trials. Meaning to say, we are allowed to fight here.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng finally grasped the real meaning behind Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s arrangements.<br>It would seem that Lord Zhenlong was protecting the challengers at first glance, but he intentionally left a loophole to that arrangement. This corridor was the exception to the rule.<br>It wouldn't be a fair fighting ground since one&rsquo;s spirit power was enhanced here. Those who acquired a larger share of the ancient remnant&rsquo;s energy would be correspondingly stronger.<br>Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s earlier instructions forbidding them from coming to blows served to mislead the challengers, making it unlikely that anyone would notice the true purpose of the corridors. If not for the Tiger person&rsquo;s prolonged absence, Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t have discovered the true purpose of the corridors either.<br>&ldquo;It looks like the Tiger person has already noticed the significance of the corridors too. He must be constructing a formation to deal with me and Bai Yunqing. It&rsquo;d be unwise to underestimate him.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes lit up in excitement, knowing that he was likely to be the strongest of them in this corridor.<br>&ldquo;Now that I know your plans, there&rsquo;s no way I would allow you to get your way.&rdquo;<br>Thus, Chu Feng started setting up a formation in the corridor too. He utilized the power of the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk on top of that, allowing him to draw out unprecedented power from his formation.<br>To prevent them from noticing anything, he disguised the assault formation as the spirit formation key floating above his head.<br>This would allow him to mislead the others about his current position, and if either the Tiger guy or Bai Yunqing dared to make a move on him in the subsequent corridors, he would immediately activate the assault formation on them.<br>To ensure that the formation worked as intended, he spent quite a bit of time constructing the formation.<br>&ldquo;Success!&rdquo;<br>Looking at the key-shaped assault formation in his hands, Chu Feng revealed a satisfied smile carrying a hint of malice.<br>So far, it didn&rsquo;t seem like Bai Yunqing had noticed the true purpose of the corridors. If anyone was going to make a move, it was likely to be the Tiger person. Based on what he had seen so far, the Tiger person seemed to be a despicable person, so he added a<br>prank<br>into his formation.<br>&ldquo;Hm? His spirit power has disappeared. It looks like he is done constructing his formation too.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was so engrossed in constructing his formation that he didn&rsquo;t pay a close eye to the Tiger person. It was only after he finished constructing his formation that he realized that the Tiger person&rsquo;s spirit power had disappeared. It was likely that he was done constructing his formation and had entered the hall.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Let&rsquo;s see what you have prepared up your sleeves.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng stepped into the spirit formation gate and returned to the hall together with his key-shaped assault formation.<br>It would have been impossible for normal formations to pass through the spirit formation gate, but from his earlier experiment with the concealment formation, he knew that formations enhanced by the ancient remnant&rsquo;s energy were able to do so.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you, Chu guy? First the Tiger trash, and now I have to wait for you too. Do I look like a pushover to you? Hurry up if you wish to continue with the trials, or else, scram! Don&rsquo;t waste my time!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing cursed.<br>However, his insults were directed not at Chu Feng but where the key-shaped assault formation was floating. Chu Feng&rsquo;s plot had succeeded.<br>&ldquo;The three of you are finally here,&rdquo; the projection of Lord Zhenlong spoke up.<br>It was no wonder Bai Yunqing was so angry. It seemed like the Tiger person had returned for a while now, making Chu Feng the last one to arrive.<br>&ldquo;Young friends, the person who inherits my legacy must not only be talented but have a discerning eye too. He must be able to assess the situation and flexibly react to it. Thus, I&rsquo;ll only offer you a single clue this round.<br>&ldquo;Think hard as to whether there are any clues in the corridor you have just passed through. If you aren&rsquo;t able to think of anything, you should enter the next corridor and take a close look,&rdquo; the projection of Lord Zhenlong said.<br>The spirit formation gate at the opposite end of the hall opened up, and the projection of Lord Zhenlong quickly slipped through it. At the same time, the spirit formation gate they had entered the hall from closed.<br>This meant that there was no way for them to back down anymore. Their only option was to advance ahead.<br>&ldquo;Are there clues in the corridors?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing murmured.<br>Clearly, he hadn&rsquo;t sensed anything amiss in the corridors yet. Knowing that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to figure anything out here, he began making his way toward the new corridor.<br>&ldquo;He actually gave out clues this round. If I hadn&rsquo;t noticed it earlier, I would be the one to suffer now.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng heaved a sigh of relief. He was certain that the Tiger person would make a move soon now that he had completed his formation. Nevertheless, he quickly hurried ahead too.<br>Shortly after entering the corridor, he saw Bai Yunqing scanning the surroundings with glowing eyes. That was probably a scanning technique. However, his flustered expression made it clear that he hadn&rsquo;t discovered anything yet. This was only to be expected, considering how his attention was in the wrong place.<br>Through the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk, Chu Feng could sense a powerful spirit power looming in Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s vicinity. That was likely to be from the Tiger person&rsquo;s formation, indicating that he was ready to strike. Despite this, the Tiger person held his position and bided his time.<br>&ldquo;Is he waiting for a chance to catch us in a single swoop? Very well, I&rsquo;ll let you have your way!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng directed the key-shaped assault formation toward Bai Yunqing while he hid a safe distance away. He believed that neither Bai Yunqing nor the Tiger person had discovered that he wasn&rsquo;t under the key.<br>If the Tiger person was really planning to eliminate them in a single swoop, he would surely make a move when the key-shaped assault formation got close to Bai Yunqing.<br>Weng!<br>Just as Chu Feng had expected, there was a burst of blinding light, and 98 formation beasts suddenly appeared all around Bai Yunqing, forming a tight encirclement around him. Naturally, Chu Feng&rsquo;s key-shaped assault formation was caught in it too.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>Bai Yunqing was bewildered. Even at this point, he still thought that the assault formation was from Lord Zhenlong. It didn&rsquo;t cross his mind that this was an assault from the Tiger person.<br>&ldquo;Brat, you sure are dumb. You still haven&rsquo;t figured out the truth yet? Taishi Xingzhong must have been blind to choose someone as dumb as a brick as his disciple,&rdquo; the Tiger person said as he finally revealed his true form.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him?!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could hardly believe his eyes when a perverted old cat holding onto a smoking pipe appeared before him. That was a person so deeply imprinted in his mind that he would never forget.<br></p></div>
