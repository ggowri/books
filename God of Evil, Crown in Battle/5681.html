        <h1>Chapter 5681: The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect’s Sectmaster Visits</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Stars Gravity Towers had seven towers, and each of them had seven floors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first two floors didn&rsquo;t pose much of a challenge to Jie Feng, but his footsteps significantly slowed when he arrived at the third floor. Nevertheless, he gritted his teeth and pushed himself to the fourth floor in a single shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stopped right at the entrance of the fourth floor and rested for a while before he looked downward and murmured, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sound at all. Is he unable to clear even the first floor?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jie Feng shook his head before pushing ahead, but it was getting more strenuous. By the time he reached the sixth floor, every step had already become a challenge to him. Each step felt so distant to him. Soon, he didn&rsquo;t even have the strength to raise his leg anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he was glued to the steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn it, I&rsquo;m stuck here again! Why can&rsquo;t I reach the top? Is our generation really weaker than the current generation of juniors?&rdquo; Jie Feng felt both exhausted and indignant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Are you at your limit?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice suddenly sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jie Feng quickly turned around and was taken aback. Chu Feng had caught up with him without him knowing, and there was not a droplet of sweat to be seen on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was almost as if they hadn&rsquo;t been climbing the same tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;W-what&rsquo;s with you?&rdquo; Jie Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why are you not tired at all?&rdquo; Jie Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t feel strained at all,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he continued scaling the tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where Jie Feng needed to exert arduous effort to take a single step, Chu Feng walked as if he was walking on normal stairs. Jie Feng stared at Chu Feng with widened eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Should I feign difficulty, lest I wound your pride? But I really don&rsquo;t feel strained at all,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get ahead of yourself, Chu Feng. There&rsquo;s no guarantee that you can get to the top even if you&rsquo;re able to reach the seventh floor. You won&rsquo;t be able to withstand the pressure,&rdquo; Jie Feng said with gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Thanks for your reminder,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he stepped onto the seventh floor, he stopped moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The seventh floor poses a bit of a challenge,&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured as he closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intended to use the same method&mdash;first adapt to the floor, then clear it in a single push.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the depths of a Sacred Mansion, there was a hot spring harnessing tremendous energy floating above the clouds. Every droplet of water inside this hot spring was invaluable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An old man was bathing in the hot spring. He had white hair and a ten-meter-long white beard that floated in mid-air. From time to time, he would let out a groan of pleasure that showed how much he enjoyed the hot spring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, his eyes opened and he shot to his feet while emanating incomparably powerful pressure. Despite his wrinkled face, he stood at a height of over three meters, and his body was incredibly muscular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed that someone was coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he soon retracted the powerful pressure and an amicable smile formed on his face. &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man turned around and donned a thin white robe that made him look like a dignified immortal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How are you feeling, Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span>?&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Not bad. Your Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Air Spring is truly a delight,&rdquo; the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span> replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We obtained the Air Spring together. Feel free to bathe in it whenever you like. But if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, you aren&rsquo;t just here for the Air Spring, right?&rdquo; The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master looked at the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span> with an enigmatic smile before suddenly asking, &ldquo;Have you been to the Totem Dragon Clan?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span> was taken aback. &ldquo;Not in recent days. Why do you suddenly ask that?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo; The eyes of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master turned sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span> replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master quietly stared at the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span> with a smile. As the overlord of a galaxy, the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span> had weathered many storms, but the other party&rsquo;s smile still made him feel uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master asked, &ldquo;Supposing that someone unites the world of cultivation, who do you think is worthy of calling the shots?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It goes without saying that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is the </span><span>most worthy</span><span> one to call the shots,&rdquo; the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span> said,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you mean it?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course! If a day comes when we need someone to unite and lead the world of cultivation, you can be certain that I&rsquo;ll support you,&rdquo; the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Those words are enough for me,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master had been smiling </span><span>all this while, the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span> only relaxed at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weng!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pillar of golden light suddenly pierced the clouds, catching both their attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a far distance away, but they could see that it was coming from a tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is that a cultivation tower?&rdquo; the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span> asked out of curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could tell that there was something special about the tower and the pillar of golden light. Something significant must have happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming from the Seven Stars Gravity Tower I personally constructed. It looks like someone has reached its top,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is it a difficult trial?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo; The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master&rsquo;s eyes were focused on the tower as he spoke. He was curious to know who had reached the top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we head over to take a look?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re interested?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I have nothing better to do anyway. I&rsquo;m curious to see which of your juniors have induced such a phenomenon,&rdquo; the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span> replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go then.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the two galaxy overlords made their way toward the Seven Stars Gravity Tower.</span></p></div>
