        <div> - Refused To Participate<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case. In that case, when will they be breaching that formation?&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder asked.<br>&ldquo;Regarding this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>That Wuma Heavenly Clansman did not know how to respond. Thus, he turned his gaze toward the grand unsealing formation.<br>&ldquo;We can begin right now.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice sounded from within the formation core.<br>It was Liangqiu Chengfeng&rsquo;s voice.<br>After Liangqiu Chengfeng finished saying those words, a palace entrance nearby, seemingly as if it had received an order, immediately opened.<br>Following that, seventeen people of the younger generation walked out of that palace.<br>Those people of the younger generation were wearing gorgeous attire and emitting extraordinary airs. They were all dragons among men.<br>Upon looking toward those seventeen people, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>Those seventeen people of the younger generation were mostly people from other clans. They should all be people that had arrived at the Wuma Heavenly Clan to pay a visit, following those grand characters from their respective powers.<br>Otherwise, without sufficient status, they wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to rest inside that palace.<br>That said, three among those seventeen were familiar faces to Chu Feng.<br>Two among them were a pair of twin sisters.<br>The pair of twin sisters were none other than Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s seventeenth and eighteenth disciples, Liangqiu Lanyue and Liangqiu Hongyue.<br>As for the other familiar face, it was someone from the Wuma Heavenly Clan, Wuma Shengjie.<br>Wuma Shengjie was still in disguise as a man. When she saw Chu Feng, she immediately revealed an angry look on her face. However, that angry look only flashed past for an instant.<br>It would appear that she was planning to pretend to not know Chu Feng.<br>That was understandable too. After all, even though he had been in the Wuma Heavenly Clan for some time now, there had been no one from the Wuma Heavenly Clan that recognized him.<br>Evidently, Wuma Shengjie had not mentioned what had happened in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm to the Wuma Heavenly Clan. As such, the Wuma Heavenly Clansmen had no idea who Chu Feng was. As such, they would naturally have no idea about the grudge between Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie.<br>As for the sisters Liangqiu Hongyue and Liangqiu Lanyue, they too noticed Chu Feng.<br>They revealed a surprised expression in their eyes upon seeing him. However&hellip; they soon shifted their eyes away from him.<br>It would appear that the pair of twin sisters were also planning to pretend to not know Chu Feng.<br>That was understandable too. After all, the two of them were Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s personal disciples. Yet, they were defeated by Chu Feng in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm in matches of world spirit techniques.<br>The two of them were proud and arrogant individuals. Naturally, they would not be willing to admit their defeat. Thus&hellip; they decided to pretend to not know Chu Feng.<br>As for Wuma Shengjie, her naked body was witnessed by Chu Feng. Regardless of whether it was intentional or not, that was still disgraceful for a young woman. Thus, she would naturally not be willing to bring that matter up.<br>Besides, there must be a reason as to why she was in disguise as a man. As such&hellip; she would definitely not attempt to settle her grudge with Chu Feng in such a place.<br>Regardless, Wuma Shengjie and the Liangqiu Sisters were being surrounded and revered by the group of geniuses from the other powers.<br>Just by looking, Chu Feng was able to tell that those geniuses were all extremely conceited. For them to act in such a manner, they had most likely witnessed the extraordinary prowess of Wuma Shengjie and the Liangqiu Sisters.<br>At the same moment Chu Feng noticed those geniuses, those geniuses also noticed Chu Feng.<br>They did not deliberately ignore Chu Feng like Wuma Shengjie and the Liangqiu Sisters. Instead, they began to carefully size him up.<br>&ldquo;Someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>When someone noticed the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s title plate on Chu Feng&rsquo;s waist, that person immediately revealed a look of disdain.<br>The powers standing behind that group of geniuses were all superior to the Chu Heavenly Clan. Thus, from the bottoms of their hearts, they looked down on the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, and especially the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>Although they did not say much, their looks of contempt caused the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to feel a sense of displeasure.<br>If they reacted this way at any other of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would not react in such a manner. However, Chu Feng was not just some member of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation; he was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s hope. As such, he would not permit these people to look down on Chu Feng in such a manner.<br>However, given his status, it would be beneath his dignity to directly take care of those people of the younger generation.<br>As such, he looked to the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder who stood beside him and said, &ldquo;Since the unsealing formation requires the assistance of members of the younger generation that are skilled in world spirit techniques, perhaps he might be of some help.&rdquo;<br>The person the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was indicating was naturally Chu Feng.<br>He felt that it was time for Chu Feng to shine, and this was a perfect opportunity to do so.<br>After all, Chu Feng was a Snake Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist, and not someone that the other people of the younger generation could possibly compare to.<br>&ldquo;Oh? This young friend is proficient in world spirit techniques?&rdquo; That Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder asked.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this junior has indeed studied world spirit techniques a bit,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with his fist clasped.<br>&ldquo;The grand unsealing formation requires one to at least be an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you possess that strength, I don&rsquo;t mind you helping us out. However, if you don&rsquo;t possess that strength, it&rsquo;s best that you not cause trouble for us.&rdquo;<br>However, before the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder could say anything, a person from the group of younger generations from the other powers interrupted.<br>After hearing what that person said, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder wanted to say something. Likely, he wanted to ask Chu Feng what level his world spirit techniques were at.<br>However, before he could say anything, he was once again interrupted. This time around, it was Chu Feng who interrupted him.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng said something that surprised everyone.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I have not come here for the sake of unsealing that formation. Besides, there are already so many of my peers gathered here. Likely, my assistance wouldn&rsquo;t matter much,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Chu Feng actually refused to participate!!!<br></p></div>
