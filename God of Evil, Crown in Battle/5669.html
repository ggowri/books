        <h1>Chapter 5669: The Woman with Divine Eyes</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder?&rdquo; Chu Feng looked at the brush in his hand, only for it to disappear in a flash of light. &ldquo;Elder? Elder?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked around while calling out for the elder, but there was no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Looks like she doesn&rsquo;t want to reveal anything to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng could tell that the brush possessed sentience; it was not a simple formation. Its disappearance indicated its reluctance to talk with him. Thus, he turned his attention toward the Conqueror Stele and the eight towering gates instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he didn&rsquo;t know was that the brush was still in the vicinity. It had teleported some distance away from Chu Feng, and it had shrunk till it was no more than 1.5 meters long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman wearing a simple but elegant golden dress that accentuated her disposition stood beside the brush. She had a fantastic figure that showed through the dress. Her face was covered by a golden veil, but her unique, tricolored eyes remained visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were purple, blue, and golden. They were beautiful and mysterious, as if it harnessed inestimable power beyond one&rsquo;s reach. Those were not the eyes of a mortal but a god.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman grabbed the brush and asked with the same euphonious voice that had echoed from the brush earlier, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you test him earlier?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master, I tried to test him but it was ineffective. There&rsquo;s something weird about that fellow&rsquo;s world spiritist bloodline. The power I infused into his bloodline was immediately absorbed, which was why he didn&rsquo;t feel anything at all,&rdquo; the voice of a younger girl echoed from the brush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that the brush did have a sentience of its own, but the woman in the golden dress was the one who had spoken to Chu Feng earlier. She had simply used the brush as a medium for communication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Oh? What kind of bloodline could render your test ineffective?&rdquo; the woman asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to look at Chu Feng as the three colors in her eyes started to revolve. Her gaze seemed to wield compelling power that allowed her to see through anything in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, the three colors in her eyes stopped revolving, but there was a hint of surprise in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline!&rdquo; the woman exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline? The Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline still exists in the present generation?&rdquo; the brush remarked in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;World spiritists should have long declined. How could there be someone with the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline?&rdquo; The woman was shocked too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then that Chu Feng suddenly turned to look in the woman&rsquo;s direction and bowed, saying, &ldquo;Elder, you&rsquo;re here, right? I can sense your earlier gaze. Can you tell me what happened here? Did someone destroy this place, or did something else happen?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Impossible! Someone of his cultivation actually sensed the gaze of master&rsquo;s Three Realms Divine Eyes?&rdquo; the brush exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t hear the conversation between the woman and the brush, though he did faintly sense the woman&rsquo;s gaze earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, I shan&rsquo;t probe any deeper since you aren&rsquo;t willing to divulge it. I shall take my leave now,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He formed a hand seal. A surge of teleportation energy enveloped him, and he disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master, did he really sense you, or is it just a blind guess?&rdquo; the brush asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman didn&rsquo;t answer the question, though she remarked, &ldquo;He has the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline. He&rsquo;s qualified.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hand seal was the power Chu Feng had grasped after leaving his name on the Conqueror Stele. It allowed him to instantaneously teleport to many locations within Nine Heavens Secret Domain, though there were still some restricted locations to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, he hadn&rsquo;t fully grasped the power of the Nine Heavens Secret Domain yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he was able to teleport back to the mysterious, towering gate, where Fu Xing was still waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you fine, Chu Feng?&rdquo; Fu Xing asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Where did you go?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I teleported somewhere else. It wasn&rsquo;t easy for me to get back. I suspect that the Nine Heavens Secret Domain is a teleportation formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t speak the complete truth, not because he didn&rsquo;t trust Fu Xing but because he simply didn&rsquo;t feel like divulging it. Just because he saw someone in a good light didn&rsquo;t mean that he was obliged to unconditionally reveal all of his secrets to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Teleportation formation? You&rsquo;re saying that the Nine Heavens Secret Domain is a teleportation formation?&rdquo; Fu Xing was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Nine Heavens Secret Domain had always been a mysterious place to all world spiritists; many believed that it contained a huge secret. She would find it terribly disappointing if it was nothing more than a teleportation formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not an ordinary teleportation formation, though I can&rsquo;t be sure. It&rsquo;s just a guess, but I sense that someone has destroyed this place,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he glanced at the mysterious, towering gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the gate had led him to the Heavenly Dome Galaxy, his gut feeling told him its true destination was not the Heavenly Dome Galaxy but the Ninth Galaxy, the Immemorial Domain of Gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng could sense that there were many teleportation formations in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain leading to each of the galaxies, but the ones leading to the Ninth Galaxy were the most numerous of all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he found that he couldn&rsquo;t activate any of the teleportation formations leading to the Ninth Galaxy. All of the teleportation passageways had been shut down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the teleportation passageways leading to the other eight galaxies, he could tell that they were constructed in the Immemorial Era, but there were marks suggesting </span><span>that they had been repaired over time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This led him to guess that someone had once wreaked havoc in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain, focusing mainly on the teleportation passageways leading to the Ninth Galaxy, which was why they remained closed to date.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any teleportation formation paired with a teleportation passageway usually went both ways. The destruction of the teleportation passageways linking the Nine Heavens Secret Domain and the Ninth Galaxy meant that those in the Ninth Galaxy couldn&rsquo;t head here either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That could be one of the reasons it was possible to enter but not leave the Ninth Galaxy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cause of the destruction could be a natural calamity or the intentional doing of a person. There was likely to be a greater scheme involved if it was the intentional doing of a person, but Chu Feng felt that this was more plausible.</span></p></div>
