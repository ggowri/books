        <h1>Chapter 4397</h1>
        <div>: Fighting the Demonic Being Once More<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Chu Feng was done setting up the formation. This time though, the formation was far stronger than the previous one from all aspects.<br>It was still in a concealed state at the moment, but once activated, its prowess would rattle the sky and earth.<br>With the current power of the formation, there was no need for Chu Feng to lure the black streak close to him anymore. As long as the black streak was within a certain radius of this formation, he would be able to exert its full might.<br>And as it just happened, the black streak was located within the area of the formation&rsquo;s strike zone.<br>Hu hu hu!<br>Blood-red smoke suddenly appeared out of nowhere, and in an instant, it had already cloaked the entire sky, as if a demon had devoured the world. With incredible momentum, it began launching its attacks against the black streak.<br>And this was the power of the formation set up by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you again?&rdquo;<br>Sensing the encroaching danger, the black streak immediately awakened from its slumber. When it saw the formation, it immediately knew who it was.<br>&ldquo;How did you find me?&rdquo; the black streak asked doubtfully.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for you to ask any questions. All you have to do today is to raise your hands and surrender.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t bother wasting words with the black streak. He channeled the full might of the formation to attack the black streak so as to capture it as soon as possible.<br>He didn&rsquo;t want to risk complicating things by extending the fight.<br>&ldquo;Looking down on this Exalted? Did you think that you would be able to catch me with your prowess? I have a lot of rage to vent right now, and I think you&rsquo;ll make a good punching bag!&rdquo;<br>A killing intent suddenly burst forth from the black streak.<br>All of a sudden, it turned incredibly rampant, and the black flame that rose all the way to the sky immediately shot forth in Chu Feng&rsquo;s direction.<br>In the blink of an eye, the black flame and the blood-red smoke had clashed with one another in a furious collision.<br>Chu Feng immediately noticed a few things from the collision.<br>The formation he had set up hadn&rsquo;t changed, but the prowess of the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk had gotten far stronger. In the first place, the formation only served as a medium for the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk to channel its strength, so it went without saying that the might of the formation was dependent on the might of the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk.<br>Chu Feng initially thought that with this enhanced power, he should be able to defeat the black streak with ease, but the black streak had grown far stronger than he had expected.<br>The two forces were actually equally matched with one another!<br>As a result, the destruction that ensued was truly catastrophic.<br>In Chu Feng&rsquo;s view, the destructive force at play here didn&rsquo;t pale in comparison to the clash between the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster and the Eight Immortal Swordswomen of the Dao Sea at all.<br>To put it in other words, the fighting prowess of both sides had already reached rank three Martial Exalted level.<br>It was fortunate that he had the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk, or else there was no way he would have stood a chance against the black streak with his current strength.<br>Awoo!<br>The black streak began howling furiously, causing it to turn even more terrifying. It seemed to have flown into a greater rage.<br>Its body began morphing along with the howl, and a peculiar glint was flickering from the black flame. All of a sudden, it appeared to have become stronger than before.<br>Given that they were equally matched a moment ago, the abrupt spurt in the prowess of the black streak caused the balance to fall apart. The black flame began devouring the blood-red smoke at a terrifying pace as it advanced toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This is bad!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the situation was bad, Chu Feng hurriedly drove the formation with all his might, but it was futile.<br>He couldn&rsquo;t reverse the tides at all.<br>Even though he was the one who set up the formation, the power had come entirely from the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk. He couldn&rsquo;t increase the might of the formation just by his own.<br>At this rate, he would really be meeting his death.<br>Awoo!<br>But just as Chu Feng thought that he was going to meet his doom, the black streak suddenly released a bizarre cry of agony that was completely different from the furious howl from a moment ago.<br>It seemed to be fearing something.<br>Even though the sound was piercing and horrifying, Chu Feng could sense a hint of quivering fear from the cry. Not only so, the ferocious black flame that was advancing on Chu Feng suddenly began retreating at this moment.<br>It didn&rsquo;t seem to be done on the volition of the black streak. Instead, it felt like there was a greater force that was suppressing it down.<br>&ldquo;Why are you treating me in such a way? I don&rsquo;t have any grudge with you!&rdquo; the black streak cried out indignantly.<br>It was then that Chu Feng realized that something was amiss. Those words didn&rsquo;t appear to be directed toward him.<br>So, he immediately turned around, only to find someone standing behind him.<br>It was the mysterious expert from before!<br>&ldquo;Could it be that&hellip;&rdquo;<br>It was upon seeing the mysterious expert that the Chu Feng suddenly put together what the black streak had said, and a realization suddenly struck him.<br>Could it be that it didn&rsquo;t come here by itself?<br>Rather, it was captured and imprisoned here instead, and the culprit behind that was this mysterious expert.<br>&ldquo;I should have risen to the top of the world, so why did you trap me here? Is my life not considered a life to you? Do I deserve to be nothing more than harvest to you cultivators?!&rdquo; the black streak cried out angrily.<br>And those words verified Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess.<br>Indeed, it was the mysterious expert who had brought it here.<br>&ldquo;Killing is an innate nature of yours. If I allow you to leave, you&rsquo;ll massacre everything in sight and bring catastrophe upon the world,&rdquo; the mysterious expert said.<br>&ldquo;Just because it&rsquo;s an innate nature doesn&rsquo;t mean that it can&rsquo;t be changed! Let me go, I promise you that I won&rsquo;t kill the innocent!&rdquo; the black streak exclaimed.<br>However, the mysterious expert didn&rsquo;t say anything more than that. Instead, she stretched out her hand and clenched her fist tightly.<br>Ahhhh!<br>The black streak let loose a miserable cry as its black flame swiftly contracted.<br>In the blink of an eye, the black flame that had risen all the way to the sky turned into nothing more than a black light object that was around the size of a fist. It slowly floated from afar before falling into the hands of the mysterious expert.<br>After capturing the black streak, the mysterious expert glanced at the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk, which stood at the center of the formation, and remarked, &ldquo;That Horsetail Whisk of yours is indeed a good treasure.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng quickly dispelled the formation before keeping his Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I won&rsquo;t take your possession,&rdquo; the mysterious expert said with a chuckle.<br>&ldquo;Elder, please don&rsquo;t misunderstand. I just thought that since the demonic being has been subdued, there&rsquo;s no need to sustain the formation any longer. But elder, regarding this matter&hellip;&rdquo;<br>There were simply too many doubts in Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind at the moment.<br>He could understand that the mysterious expert making a deal with him, exchanging the treasure from the Sagacious Grandmaster for the location of the black streak. But he couldn&rsquo;t understand why the mysterious expert would go to the extent of imprisoning the black streak here. Did she really do this in order to get Chu Feng&rsquo;s help on that matter?<br>Or was she trying to lure him here using the black streak?<br>Shoosh!<br>While Chu Feng was in a state of confusion, the mysterious expert finally took off her bamboo hat. With the veil removed, her true appearance came into sight.<br></p></div>
