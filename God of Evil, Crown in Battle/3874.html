        <h1>Chapter 3873</h1>
        <div> - YinYang Guidance Lamps<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Mystic Cave Saints immediately took out medicinal pellets and swallowed them. They were medicine to bring relief from pain and remove poisons from one&rsquo;s body.<br>Each one of those medicinal pellets were extremely expensive. Generally, they would take effect immediately.<br>However, after the Mystic Cave Saints took those medicinal pellets, there was not even the slightest effect.<br>&ldquo;Motherfucker! This is no poison! It seems to be a curse instead!&rdquo; The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints cursed out loud. Enduring the intense pain, he took out two more medicinal pellets and swallowed one.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, swallow this. It is a medicinal pellet that can remove curses,&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints as he handed the other medicinal pellet to Chu Feng.<br>Actually, Chu Feng had already begun to try his best to remove his curse when he noticed that he was afflicted with one.<br>After all, Chu Feng now knew some curse-removal techniques.<br>However, his efforts were completely useless.<br>The techniques he knew were simply unable to do anything to the curse afflicting him at that moment now.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng discovered that the burning pain had disappeared.<br>Not only that, but the fiery red illuminating imprints of the talismans had also disappeared from his body.<br>&ldquo;Woah! Big brother, those curse-removal pellets are truly effective!&rdquo; The others from the Mystic Cave Saints praised.<br>The reason for that was because their pain had also disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Of course. For the sake of these medicinal pellets, I had&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wait, that&rsquo;s strange. Brother Asura still didn&rsquo;t take the medicinal pellet.&rdquo;<br>The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints was boasting when he suddenly discovered that the medicinal pellet he had handed to Chu Feng was still in his hand. Chu Feng had not taken the medicinal pellet at all.<br>Thus, it was not the pellets being effective. Rather, the power of the curse had vanished.<br>But, why would the power of the curse suddenly vanish?<br>&ldquo;Thump~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thump~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the two coffins suddenly stood up.<br>Once the coffins stood up, one could see that there were actually spirit formation gates in them.<br>However, those were not ordinary spirit formation gates. Bodies of light were present above them.<br>The two bodies of light were released from the two coffins. They interwove with each other and formed several large characters that floated above the two coffins.<br>&lsquo;To remove the curse, one must enter the coffin.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Two coffins, life and death.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Correct choice, life.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Wrong choice, death.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;He who lives shall obtain the inheritance!!!&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing those large characters, Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints all tensed up.<br>They realized what sort of decision they had to make.<br>The curse on their bodies had not been removed. They must enter a coffin in order to remove their curse.<br>However, only one of the two coffins would let them live. As for the other one, it would lead to death.<br>Thus, they must make the right choice. If they made the wrong selection, not only would their curse not be removed, but they would also die in the coffin.<br>However, if they made the right choice, their curse would be removed and they would also be able to obtain the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s inheritance.<br>&ldquo;Great, truly great.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, it&rsquo;s all thanks to you that we&rsquo;re so fortunate.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Mystic Cave Saints were wild with joy. Even though they were clearly eleven old monsters, they were so excited that it seemed like they were about to leap with joy.<br>To the eleven of them, treasures were fatally enticing. Thus, they would naturally be extremely excited upon seeing that the chance to obtain the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s inheritance was before them.<br>&ldquo;You all are feeling joyous too early, no? If we select the wrong coffin, all of us will die.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Pah! Coffin? We&rsquo;re not dead yet! They&rsquo;re gates! Those are gates to us!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt rather displeased.<br>He was so displeased that he was cursing the Great Monster Slayer Emperor for being a bastard in his heart.<br>To actually place two coffins for them to select, this Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s behavior was simply too ominous.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, we brothers have traveled the world for many years.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While we might not dare to say we&rsquo;ve accomplished anything else, we dare say that we&rsquo;ve obtained a lot of treasures.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of the treasures we possess, there is one that&rsquo;s used precisely to handle this sort of situation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That treasure can only be used once. All these years, we brothers were very reluctant to use it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However now, that treasure will finally come in handy," said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, could it be that you&rsquo;re going to use the YinYang Guidance Lamps?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the other Mystic Cave Saints also became extremely excited.<br>It could be seen that they were truly looking forward to the so-called YinYang Guidance Lamps.<br>From their anticipation-filled behavior, Chu Feng realized that the so-called YinYang Guidance Lamps were most definitely a very powerful treasure.<br>&ldquo;As matters stand, it will be put to good use,&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>As he spoke, he streaked his hand across his Cosmos Sack.<br>However, no lamp appeared. Instead, a talisman paper appeared in his hand.<br>Once the talisman paper appeared, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints immediately placed it between his hands and began to imbue his spirit power into the talisman paper.<br>&ldquo;YinYang Guidance Lamps, determine fate for me!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Activate!&rdquo;<br>After saying that, he pointed both hands forward.<br>The talisman paper suddenly changed. It turned into a strand of bright light and charged forth.<br>Soon, the light split in two and entered the two coffins.<br>Merely, after they entered the coffins, they did not fully fuse with the revolving spirit formation gates.<br>Instead, they turned into two lamps floating in the center of either spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, my YinYang Guidance Lamps have taken effect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Soon, a lamp will light up. That lamp will represent the life coffin,&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Actually, there&rsquo;s simply no need to use that treasure,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Ah? What do you mean?&rdquo; The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints felt very puzzled.<br>&ldquo;Look carefully. Aren&rsquo;t those spirit formation gates ordinary spirit formation gates? There&rsquo;s a way to solve them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be to find the hint, the hint of life and death. As long as we carefully examine the two spirit formation gates, we will be able to determine which gate is the life gate, and which one is the death gate,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he pointed to the two coffins.<br>Upon closer inspection, the Mystic Cave Saints discovered what Chu Feng said to be true.<br>&ldquo;Fuck! Brother Asura, why didn&rsquo;t you mention that sooner?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the eldest of the Mystic Cave Saint felt extremely pained.<br>The YinYang Guidance Lamps were a precious treasure that he had been very reluctant to use.<br>The only reason why he had used it was because he felt he had no other way to solve their dilemma without using it.<br>Never would he have imagined that there were actually other methods to breach the spirit formation gates. This meant that he had wasted his YinYang Guidance Lamps.<br>At that moment, he truly felt as if he was bleeding from his heart.<br></p></div>
