        <h1>Chapter 4118</h1>
        <div> - Sacred Light<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, the ruler of the Heaven-devouring Realm, currently had a frightened look on his face, and was sweating cold sweat. He was so terrified that even his breathing had grown hurried.<br>The reason for that was due to the change in the body of light.<br>The body of light was no longer only simply sealing off the main palace hall.<br>Instead, it had covered the entire Netherworld Ice Hall.<br>Even though the dazzling light that covered everything appeared so very sacred, it was extremely terrifying in the eyes of the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>The reason for that was because what that light brought upon the Netherworld Ice Hall was destruction and death.<br>The Netherworld Ice Hall had been turned into a complete mess.<br>Practically all the buildings had been destroyed.<br>The hundreds of millions of people in the Netherworld Ice Hall had all fallen to the ground.<br>Screams filled the entire Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s skies, and blood covered the ground below.<br>The people that were still alive were all Experts of Exalted-level or above.<br>All the cultivators beneath the Exalted level had died.<br>Furthermore, those that had died did not even die with complete corpses. Their manner of death was truly tragic.<br>That said, the situation was not hopeful for those that were alive either. Even the Utmost Exalted-level experts had been seriously injured.<br>The only person in the entire Netherworld Ice Hall that was uninjured was their Hall Master.<br>The cause of this catastrophe was that body of light.<br>It was the body of light that had destroyed the Netherworld Ice Hall and obliterated the people there.<br>&hellip;...<br>The Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master looked towards the main hall and noticed that it was completely undamaged.<br>However, his eyes did not stop at the main hall.<br>The reason for that was because outside the main hall stood an old granny.<br>She was none other than Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandmother.<br>The old granny looked completely different from when Chu Feng had met her earlier.<br>The kindness and good-natured air she emitted had completely disappeared from her face, and had been replaced with grim coldness.<br>Most importantly would be the oppressive might she emitted. Her oppressive might was unparalleled, and looked down on everything; suppressing everything.<br>Before her oppressive might, even the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master became incomparably small and weak.<br>If the god of the region used to be the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, then it had changed hands.<br>The old granny was now the god of the region.<br>Before her, the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had been reduced to a mere mortal.<br>&ldquo;Exactly who are you? Why did you release such a vicious attack upon my Netherworld Ice Hall?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be because of the people earlier?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s because of them, I will apologize to you now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I had no idea that an expert of your caliber was backing them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I had known, I wouldn&rsquo;t have dared to capture them at all, much less injure them,&rdquo; the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said.<br>He was trying his hardest to keep his calm. But, even though he was trying his hardest to conceal his fear, he was still unable to keep his voice from shivering.<br>&ldquo;They are indeed people that you shouldn&rsquo;t have touched.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, even if it wasn&rsquo;t for them your Netherworld Ice Hall would still suffer this calamity should you encounter me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, you have done all sorts of evil deeds. You are scum amongst cultivators. Scum like yourselves are not worthy of living in this world,&rdquo; After the old granny finished saying those words, a trace of ruthlessness flashed through her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, firecracker-like noises sounded from all over the Netherworld Ice Hall.<br>Those were not firecrackers though. Instead, what was exploding were bodies of the experts of the Netherworld Ice Hall.<br>Accompanying every muffled explosion was a bloody blossom. With every bloody blossom, a life disappeared from the world.<br>In merely the blink of an eye, the screams had disappeared from the Netherworld Ice Hall.<br>Dead. They were all dead.<br>Apart from the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, the hundreds of millions of members had all died.<br>However, those that had just been killed were all Exalted and Utmost Exalted-level experts.<br>In the blink of an eye, all those experts had been reduced to pools of blood.<br>After killing hundreds of millions of experts, that old granny was actually expressionless. Her aged face remained completely unmoved. It was as if those she had killed earlier were not people, but ants.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; exactly who are you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You and I are total strangers. Why do you insist on eradicating us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The world of martial cultivators is one where the weak are prey to the strong. Have you not slaughtered innocent people before?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Amongst those that you killed earlier, there were innocent people too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve acknowledged my mistake. Why couldn&rsquo;t you spare us and let us live?&rdquo;<br>The tone of the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s voice was filled with anger, suffering and even grief.<br>He felt extremely powerless.<br>He had been a king that had ruled over the entire Heaven-devouring Realm.<br>However, to his surprise a malignant star had appeared all of a sudden.<br>Not only had that malignant star brought destruction upon his Netherworld Ice Hall, even he himself was at death&rsquo;s door.<br>This sudden misfortune left him at a complete loss as to what to do, even when he was confronted with death.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. The world of martial cultivators is one where the weak are prey to the strong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you all can view people weaker than yourselves as fish and meat on the chopping block, I can naturally do the same and kill you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, in my eyes your lives are worth less than even ants,&rdquo; said the old granny.<br>&ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; The Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master also exploded.<br>Dead. The existence that had ruled over the Heaven-devouring Realm for so many years had died just like that.<br>Following that, the old granny disappeared.<br>Even though the old granny had left, the body of light still enveloped the Netherworld Ice Hall.<br>The dazzling light caught the attention of many people outside the Netherworld Ice Hall.<br>They were all staring at the direction of the Netherworld Ice Hall with surprise and unease.<br>They did not know what was happening there. However, they could sense how powerful the light was.<br>It was a sort of light that they could not breach, and could not defeat.<br>In fact, they did not even dare to approach the light.<br>In their eyes, the light was very sacred.<br>In fact, many people felt the urge to worship it.<br>Their intuitive feeling from the depths of their soul was telling them that they could not blaspheme that light.<br>Unless the light disappeared on its own, they would likely never be able to see the insides of the light during their entire lives. They would have no idea exactly what happened to the Netherworld Ice Hall that was enveloped by the light.<br>&hellip;...<br>After journeying for some time, Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings finally returned to the sealed territory.<br>However, the little girl had separated from them.<br>The little girl not only had the same name as Little Fishy, but her personality was also very similar.<br>She enjoyed roaming around, and had a very mysterious origin.<br>Even though Fumo Xin&rsquo;er had invited her to stay in the sealed territory, the little girl had refused.<br>&hellip;...<br>Enroute back to the sealed territory, Fumo Shaoyu learned of Chu Feng&rsquo;s desire to leave the Heaven-devouring Realm.<br>Fumo Shaoyu had actually planned to leave the Heaven-devouring Realm for a long time as well.<br>Taking advantage of the fact that his grandma wasn&rsquo;t here, the three of them proceeded directly for the blazing cliff upon their return to the sealed territory.<br>However, their Demon Vanquishing Clan were unable to use their Demon Vanquishing Talismans that could curb the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts at the blazing cliff.<br>As such, the journey was extremely dangerous.<br>That said, even though it was dangerous, Chu Feng still had to try. After all, that was the only way for him to leave.<br></p></div>
