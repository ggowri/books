Furthermore, the pond water was not something that ordinary people could set even a foot into.<br>The reason for that was because the pond water was pitch-black like ink. Furthermore, it emitted a very nauseating odor. Merely by looking at it, one could tell that it was no ordinary water.<br>In fact, it was indeed no ordinary water. It was a sort of poisonous water. Those below Martial Emperor could not make the slightest contact with the water. Otherwise, they would be seriously poisoned and killed. The poison would directly dissolve them into pools of blood.<br>As such, the nauseating smell of the Drought Demon&rsquo;s Damned Pond was mostly that of the reeking of blood. This meant that countless lives had ended within it.<br>Furthermore, not only was the water pitch-black, even the gaseous substances that rose from the pond water were black. Like black clouds, the gases filled the sky and covered the earth. If ordinary people were to enter that layer of black gas, they would simply become unable to move, as they would not be able to see anything.<br>However, as for martial cultivators, they possessed eyesight that surpassed that of ordinary people after reaching a certain level of cultivation. Merely by reaching Half Martial Ancestor level, one would no longer be obstructed by the black gases. There was no need to mention Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong. After all, the three of them were outstanding world spiritists. The gases covering the region were simply unable to hinder their vision. Before them, those black gases were akin to nothing.<br>At that moment, the two powerful Fairy Spirit World world spirits were leading the path for Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong. They were flying rapidly through the Drought Demon&rsquo;s Damned Pond.<br>Chu Feng had a serious expression on his face as he closely fixed his eyes on the area before him. Emotions filled his heart, causing him to feel both joyous and worried.<br>Su Rou and Su Mei were two women who he had known since his youth. For him, the two of them had made enormous sacrifices. Furthermore, they had helped Chu Feng enormously. The two of them had protected Chu Feng many times, and nearly sacrificed themselves in the process.<br>Since he was young, Chu Feng had made a vow that he would definitely protect Su Rou and Su Mei once he grew up and became powerful.<br>Yet, the Moon Immortal had snatched Su Rou and Su Mei&rsquo;s bodies away right in front of him. At that time, Chu Feng had been powerless to do anything about it.<br>That was a knot in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart. He had always felt extremely ashamed, and thought that he had not managed to protect his women, that he had let Su Rou and Su Mei down.<br>And now, it was very possible that an opportunity to save Su Rou and Su Mei had presented itself before him. As such, Chu Feng would naturally be feeling extremely emotional.<br>That said, Chu Feng was scared that those two women that Zhao Yu had spoken of weren&rsquo;t Su Rou and Su Mei.<br>&ldquo;B-brother, l-let me have a l-look at that map,&rdquo; Wang Qiang suddenly said.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng handed the map to Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough,&rdquo; Wang Qiang&rsquo;s gaze changed slightly.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked. He was able to tell that Wang Qiang seemed to have discovered something.<br>&ldquo;This route is t-the same r-route to the location of my treasures,&rdquo; Wang Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;Same route?&rdquo; Chu Feng and Zhao Hong were both surprised.<br>&ldquo;T-that&rsquo;s right, t-they&rsquo;re the same. A-according to the direction on my treasure map, the f-first checkpoint will be c-coming soon. T-that is a region w-where one cannot f-fly. One m-must walk on the water. However, t-the pond water t-there pos-possesses enormous g-gravitational force. Those b-below Half Martial Ancestor w-will not be a-able to escape from the suction of the w-water.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, t-to the three of us, t-that poses no threat. That said&hellip; the r-region with t-the enormous gravitational f-force just so h-happens to be the destination of this map,&rdquo; Wang Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;In other words, if that Zhao Yu did not deceive us, those two women who are very likely to be Lil&rsquo; Rou and Lil&rsquo; Mei are training at the first checkpoint?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;T-that&rsquo;s v-very possible,&rdquo; Wang Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Since it won&rsquo;t be able to stop us, let&rsquo;s just proceed directly,&rdquo; Zhao Hong declared. Then, she said to her two world spirits, &ldquo;Go a bit faster.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Once Zhao Hong gave the order, the two world spirits increased their speed. Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong began to fly rapidly through the pitch-black sky above the Drought Demon&rsquo;s Damned Pond with the speed of light.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the two world spirits stopped flying. Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong also began to look toward the area ahead of them with cautious gazes.<br>That place did not appear to be anything extraordinary at first glance. It appeared to be the same as the other regions of the Drought Demon&rsquo;s Damned Pond.<br>However&hellip; that was the destination on Zhao Yu&rsquo;s map. It was also the checkpoint that Wang Qiang had mentioned.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s simply no one here. Chu Feng, it seems you&rsquo;ve been deceived. Let&rsquo;s return immediately so that we can teach that bastard a proper lesson,&rdquo; As Zhao Hong spoke, she turned around.<br>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; However, Chu Feng extended his hand to stop Zhao Hong. Then, he said, &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem to have deceived us. There are indeed traces of someone training here. Furthermore, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been long since they left.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Hearing what Chu Feng said, Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang were both shocked. The reason for that was because neither one of them were able to notice any traces of people training at that location.<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, they have already left. We arrived too late,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;B-brother, a-are Su R-Rou and Su Mei&rsquo;s auras t-there?&rdquo; Wang Qiang asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head regretfully.<br>Disappointed. At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart was filled with disappointment.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, although I do not know how important those two women are to you, you shouldn&rsquo;t forget about our purpose in coming here. Since we&rsquo;ve already come so far, we should continue onward. After all, my husband&rsquo;s treasures are ahead,&rdquo; Zhao Hong said.<br>&ldquo;We cannot continue just like this,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang asked in unison.<br>&ldquo;Brother, is this the only route to that treasure?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to ask Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;T-that&rsquo;s right. According to the map, this p-place is unavoidable. If we are to t-try to b-bypass this place, we w-will be affected b-by the spirit formation in t-the Drought De-Demon&rsquo;s Damned Pond, and f-forever be u-unable to find the treasure,&rdquo; Wang Qiang said.<br>&ldquo;In other words, we must proceed according to the route indicated on your map, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the map said,&rdquo; Wang Qiang nodded.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, did you discover something?&rdquo; Zhao Hong asked.<br>&ldquo;Although this place does not appear to have any abnormalities, it is actually filled with hidden dangers. As for what sort of dangers, even I am unable to tell. However, it is definitely not as simple as losing the ability to fly and the enormous gravitational force from the water that Wang Qiang spoke of,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;But&hellip; why did I not notice anything strange?&rdquo; Zhao Hong&rsquo;s gaze changed slightly. Her eyes flickered with a trace of suspicion. After all, not only was she an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, she was also someone who had grasped extremely powerful observation methods.<br>&ldquo;Truth be told, the observation method that I train in is called Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes. My Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes have never deceived me before. They have helped me determine dangers and find opportunities many times.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This time around, it gave me a perilous sign. For the sake of our safety, it is better that we move more cautiously,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;B-brother, w-what do you have in mind?&rdquo; Wang Qiang asked.<br>&ldquo;Set up this formation. We will be able to pass through that area safely with that,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he outlined a spirit formation diagram.<br>It was a spirit formation that looked like a magic cloud. Standing on that spirit formation, they would no longer be affected by the special powers of that region. Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong would be able to pass safely through the region by standing on the spirit formation and flying through the sky.<br>The way Chu Feng saw it, this would be the safest method to pass through that region.<br>&ldquo;This spirit formation&hellip; even if the three of us are to jointly set it up, it will still require six entire hours.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, I did not discover anything unknown or dangerous using my own observation methods.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not to mention that setting up this spirit formation will waste time and exhaust our spirit power, most importantly&hellip; I feel that it is simply needless,&rdquo; Zhao Hong said.<br>&ldquo;Zhao Hong, please trust me. Wang Qiang is my best brother and you are my friend. I would definitely not waste your time for no reason,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I also urge you to trust me. Perhaps my observation method might be inferior to yours, however, it will absolutely not make any mistakes. I trust that I have seen through everything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for what I saw, it is that there are simply no dangers ahead. We will be able to easily and safely pass through it without using any special methods.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, let me remind you of this. We were only able to safely reach this place because of me, Zhao Hong and not you, Chu Feng,&rdquo; Zhao Hong said to Chu Feng one word at a time. Her tone was somewhat ill-intended.<br><br></p></div>
