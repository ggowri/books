        <div>: A Difficult Enemy<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Are you going to fight me or not? If you wish to back out, I&rsquo;ll just take Yu Ting away with me right now,&rdquo; Li Muzhi asked Chu Feng impatiently.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight you. Let&rsquo;s go with what we have agreed on thus far. If I lose, my life will be yours to take. If I win, you have to speak up on Yu Ting&rsquo;s behalf,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Sounds good. How do you want to fight?&rdquo; Li Muzhi asked.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s construct a formation together within a limited period of time. One of us will attack whereas the other one will defend&hellip;&rdquo;<br>But before Chu Feng could finish his words, Li Muzhi had already interjected right in, &ldquo;Wait wait wait, that&rsquo;s way too old-fashioned!&rdquo;<br>He didn&rsquo;t like Chu Feng&rsquo;s suggestion at all.<br>&ldquo;What other suggestion do you have then? If you find this boring, we can also pit out spirit power directly against one another too,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That would be meaningless. What you have proposed is simply too old-fashioned and conventional. Boring, I&rsquo;d say. Allow me to set the rules instead,&rdquo; Li Muzhi said.<br>&ldquo;Sure, you can propose the rules,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied heartily.<br>He was interested to see what kind of duel Li Muzhi was going to propose.<br>&ldquo;Do you know any slaughtering formations? I&rsquo;m referring to those that have superior offensive prowess but still can be completed within half an incense&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; Li Muzhi asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I do know a few,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Good. Choose the most complicated slaughtering formation you have that can be completed within half an incense&rsquo;s time and show me its blueprint. After that, you&rsquo;ll set up the slaughtering formation before me within half an incense&rsquo;s time. If you&rsquo;re able to do it, I&rsquo;ll have to construct the same formation based on the blueprint too.<br>&ldquo;Of course, as I&rsquo;m bound to be unfamiliar with the blueprint you&rsquo;re showing me, it&rsquo;s likely that I would be constructing the formation for the first time. So, the time limit for me would be an incense&rsquo;s time. If I am able to successfully construct your formation within an incense&rsquo;s time, it would be considered as my victory for the first round.<br>&ldquo;The rules for the second round will be the same as the first round, but we&rsquo;ll swap roles, &ldquo;Li Muzhi said.<br>&ldquo;What if the both of us successfully set up the other party&rsquo;s formation within the time limit?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy. We&rsquo;ll pit the formations we have constructed against one another and see whose is stronger. Of course, that means that we&rsquo;ll have to learn how to control each other&rsquo;s formation too. To put it in simple words, this is a test of our ability to construct and control formations that we&rsquo;re unfamiliar with,&rdquo; Li Muzhi said.<br>&ldquo;Sounds interesting. Let&rsquo;s go by your rules then!&rdquo;<br>Without any hesitation, Chu Feng began drawing out the blueprint of a slaughtering formation. It was a particularly complicated slaughtering formation that wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to set up at all.<br>It was to the point where Li Muzhi had started frowning, and he even asked Chu Feng, &ldquo;Are you sure that you&rsquo;ll be able to set up this formation within half an incense&rsquo;s time?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Just watch.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng began to release his formation, and before everyone&rsquo;s eyes, he began to set up the formation based on the blueprint he had just drawn out.<br>This slaughtering formation was no joke at all. Its prowess would surpass even that of ordinary Exalted Taboo Martial Skills if one could set it up successfully.<br>And yet, Chu Feng really managed to finish constructing it within half an incense&rsquo;s time.<br>&ldquo;Not bad, you do have some skills. It&rsquo;s my turn then. Make sure to watch the time properly. If I can&rsquo;t set up the formation within an incense&rsquo;s time, it&rsquo;ll be considered as my loss,&rdquo; Li Muzhi said.<br>In the next moment, Li Muzhi released his spirit power and began setting up the formation which Chu Feng demonstrated a moment ago.<br>Li Muzhi&rsquo;s ability to control his spirit power had truly reached an incredible level. Even though it was his first time setting up this slaughtering formation, which resulted in his maneuvers looking a little stiff, with his superior control over spirit power and his deep understanding of formations, he was still able to construct the formations quickly.<br>In terms of speed, he wasn&rsquo;t slower than Chu Feng by too much.<br>In the end, it only took him two-thirds of an incense&rsquo;s time to finish constructing the offensive formation Chu Feng had provided to him.<br>&ldquo;Incredible!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this sight, Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s parents couldn&rsquo;t help but remark in awe.<br>At the same time, Long Xiaoxiao couldn&rsquo;t help but look at Chu Feng worriedly.<br>She trusted in Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength, but after witnessing Li Muzhi&rsquo;s performance, she knew that Chu Feng had encountered a difficult opponent this time around.<br>Even the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had nodded slightly in approval after looking at the formation constructed by Li Muzhi.<br>The formation which Chu Feng had chosen for this duel was no simple formation. Most world spiritists would have to take some time to study and practice it before they would be able to fully grasp it.<br>Yet, despite being his first time constructing it, the time Li Muzhi took was only slightly more than Chu Feng, and its level of completion was still at a satisfactory level.<br>This was more than enough to showcase Li Muzhi&rsquo;s talent in world spiritist techniques. He was indeed a prodigy.<br>&ldquo;Looks like Chu Feng has really met his match today!&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist exclaimed as he turned to look at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You have won the first round. It&rsquo;s your turn to show me your formation. I, Chu Feng, am interested to see just what kind of slaughtering formation do the disciples of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect use!&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo;<br>Li Muzhi burst into laughter upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;My formation is naturally superior to yours. As long as you can defeat me today, you would have been learning one of our formations for free. That&rsquo;s a big deal, you know? It&rsquo;s just that you&rsquo;ll need to prove yourself capable first.&rdquo;<br>What Li Muzhi effectively said was that if Chu Feng were to lose this duel, he would be losing his life. So, even if Chu Feng were to learn Li Muzhi&rsquo;s formation, it would be all for naught.<br>Weng!<br>All of a sudden, a brilliant spirit power unfurled in midair, reminiscent of an unrolling scroll.<br>Everyone, be it Chu Feng, Long Xiaoxiao, her parents, and even Chu Ting, were all staring at the formation blueprint that Li Muzhi was drawing out with his spirit power.<br>This was the slaughtering formation that Li Muzhi had chosen for the duel.<br>Even though they were outsiders, they were still allowed to see the formation blueprint. If this slaughtering formation was indeed formidable, they would benefit greatly from it by remembering it.<br>And in truth, this slaughtering formation didn&rsquo;t disappoint them either.<br>The formation blueprint that Li Muzhi had provided was even more ingenious than what Chu Feng had provided earlier. It was one of the rare great formations.<br>Weng!<br>After drawing out the blueprint, Li Muzhi got straight to constructing the formation.<br>His movements were very dexterous, and the construction of the formation went much smoother than earlier.<br>Once again, this perfectly demonstrated his talents as a world spiritist.<br>In less than half an incense&rsquo;s time, a golden formation that spanned over a hundred meters in diameter was already towering right before Li Muzhi.<br>Shoosh!<br>After the formation was constructed, Li Muzhi dissipated the formation with a wave of his sleeves, leaving behind just the slaughtering formation he had constructed in the first round.<br>He had to keep the slaughtering formation from the first round in case Chu Feng successfully constructed his slaughtering formation too, in which case, they would be pitting their formations against one another in order to determine the winner.<br>&ldquo;How is it? My formation is not too bad, right? It&rsquo;s just that we don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;ll be getting a chance to construct it a second time,&rdquo; Li Muzhi said with glee all over his face.<br>Even though he had kept the slaughtering formation from the first round, in truth, he didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng would be able to complete the formation he had provided within an incense&rsquo;s time.<br>He knew just how difficult it would be to construct the formation he had provided.<br>Even with his talents, he wasn&rsquo;t able to construct it within an incense&rsquo;s time when he first tried it.<br>If even he was unable to do it, how could Chu Feng do it?<br></p></div>
