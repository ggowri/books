        <div> - The Strength Of The Sacred Mansion<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Oh? What was the situation like back then? Exactly what happened? Is it possible for you to inform me?&rdquo;<br>Upon learning that Chu Feng had experienced another occasion of his bloodline going berserk in the past, Xianhai Shaoyu revealed a great amount of interest.<br>Chu Feng did not try to conceal things from him and informed Xianhai Shaoyu what happened back then.<br>&ldquo;Judging from that, it seemed that brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s first time of bloodline going berserk was triggered by anger.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, it is understandable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, brother Chu Feng, you were clearly unconscious when your bloodline ran berserk this time around.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The situation is completely different from the one back then. For your bloodline to suddenly berserk, it is quite incomprehensible.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, are these two the only occasions you had your bloodline go berserk?&rdquo; Xianhai Shaoyu asked.<br>&ldquo;These two occassions should be the only ones,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Good. If that&rsquo;s the case, things aren&rsquo;t that bad,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, why do you say that?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;According to my understanding, bloodline berserking is the manifestation of a powerful bloodline.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, if one&rsquo;s bloodline berserks too often, it would lead to one&rsquo;s bloodline going out of control.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;According to historical records, there has been a senior with a very powerful bloodline to appear in the martial cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That senior, due to having his bloodline go berserk too often, ended up losing his mind and became a homicidal demon. Everywhere he passed, a calamity ensued.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Later on, he disappeared all of a sudden.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;People possess different opinions for his sudden disappearance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are people that say he was completely devoured by his bloodline and ended up being killed by his own bloodline.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are also others that said that he was killed by the joint effort of various experts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, regardless of what happened, he did not receive a good end.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, a saying came to be. If one&rsquo;s bloodline berserks too often, it meant that the person with that bloodline was unable to control their bloodline.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In other words, the person who possessed that powerful bloodline was unqualified to possess it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline had only gone berserk twice, it should still be fine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, you should still be careful. You must spend more time tempering your heart and mind, to strengthen your willpower. It will increase your control over your soul and your bloodline.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Only through that would you be able to prevent your bloodline from going berserk too often,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, thank you for your warning. I will definitely take note of it,&rdquo; said Chu Feng thankfully.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s call to his attention, Chu Feng would have no idea about bloodlines going berserk, much less take note of it.<br>&ldquo;Earlier, you saved me. You could be said to my savior. This warning of mine is nothing in comparison to what you&rsquo;ve done for me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Brother Chu Feng, do you know why I mentioned the Demon Morph Clan?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because the Demon Morph Clan used to be called the Yuwen Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for that Yuwen Heavenly Clan, they are the power with the greatest control over Heavenly Bloodline in the entire martial cultivation world. They were deemed as the strongest Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Oh? The strongest Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; Chu Feng was surprised. After all, what flowed through his body was also Heavenly Bloodline.<br>&ldquo;The Yuwen Heavenly Clan used to be the overlord of the Bloodline Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, they were overthrown by the combined forces of the other powers in the Bloodline Galaxy and banished from the Bloodline Galaxy. Because of that, they underwent a drastic change and became the Demon Morph Clan. As for why they decided to do so, I have no idea.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, ever since they changed their name to the Demon Morph Clan, they renounced their upright image of the past and began to loot and plunder throughout the vast martial cultivation world. They would not shrink from any crime and are now one of the most notorious and dangerous wicked powers in the entire martial cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The current Bloodline Galaxy is a place without any ruler. All sorts of wicked powers are occupying that place. It is extremely chaotic and deemed as a forbidden area,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Then what about the other regions?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Occupying the Northern Region are the Immortal Sea Galaxy and Totem Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The overlord of the Immortal Sea Galaxy is our Immortal Sea Fish Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the Totem Galaxy, their ruler is the Totem Dragon Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This Totem Dragon Clan is a descendant of the Dragon Clan. Flowing through their bodies is the bloodline closest to the Divine Dragon. Because of that, they are extremely powerful,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;For brother Shaoyu&rsquo;s clan to be able to be located in the Northern Region together with the Totem Dragon Clan, I presume that your clan&rsquo;s strength is also extraordinary,&rdquo; said Chu feng.<br>&ldquo;Hehe. Brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess is correct. Our Immortal Sea Fish Clan is not weak at all,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu proudly.<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve described the Eastern Region, Western Region and Northern Region for me, there must be one for the Southern Region too, right?&rdquo;<br>His gaze grew particularly serious when he asked that question.<br>He was waiting to hear information regarding the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion the entire time.<br>Judging from what he had learned so far, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion should be located in the Southern Region. But, while he already knew of their general location, he still wanted to know more about them.<br>After all, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was the power that he needed to challenge.<br>While the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was where his mother was at, they&rsquo;ve imprisoned his mother.<br>Purely due to that, Chu Feng was bound to become hostile with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.<br>&ldquo;The Southern Region possesses the Seven Realms Galaxy and Divine Body Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Divine Body Galaxy&rsquo;s ruler is the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion. That place is not a conventional clan or sect. Instead, it is a place that gathered the strongest Divine Bodies in the entire vast martial cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the ruler of the Seven Realms Galaxy, they are the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, with how outstanding your world spirit techniques are, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly not know about the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, right? That is the holy land for you world spiritists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Practically all the world spiritists in the entire martial cultivation world yearned to be able to join the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;I had indeed heard about the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. However, they&rsquo;re merely hearsays. I do not know much details about them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion very powerful? How do they rank among the entire martial cultivation world?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;As the sacred mansion that gathered the strongest world spiritists in the entire martial cultivation world, is there even a need to ask that question?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion possesses the strongest world spirit techniques in the entire martial cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, they specialized in world spirits and had trained them to a pinnacle level.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Their world spirit techniques might even be different from the ones that you knew.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As such, when the people from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion fights others, they will always be using their world spirit techniques and practically never their martial skills.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Being situated in the Southern Region together, it is inevitable for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and Divine Body Heavenly Mansion to fight to determine superiority.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, many years ago, for the sake of fighting over the title as the strongest power in the Southern Region, the Mansion Master of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion and the Mansion Master of the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion had a major battle.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That was a battle between a world spiritist and a martial cultivator.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was a battle between martial skills and world spirit techniques.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, even though the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master was overwhelmingly strong and had trained his Divine Power to its peak, he was defeated in that battle.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is a place with countless experts. Their Mansion Master is not the only powerful expert there. Apart from him are countless other powerful world spiritists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Say, what sort of power would the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion be?&rdquo; Xianhai Shaoyu asked Chu Feng instead of answering his question.<br></p></div>
