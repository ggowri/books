        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>The World Spiritist Painter preferred a serene environment, so he resided in an Ordinary Realm&rsquo;s mountain range. The mountain range was previously unnamed, but it was named &lsquo;Painter Mountain&rsquo; due to the presence of the World Spiritist Painter.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was currently on his way to Painter Mountain. He saw quite a few people along the way, and they were headed in the same direction too. Most of them were outsiders; there were very few locals in this Ordinary Realm.</span><br><span>There were some cities along the way, but there were very few people in there. This realm was surprisingly barren compared to the other Ordinary Realms.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why are there so few people here? Given how famous the World Spiritist Painter is, shouldn&rsquo;t there be more people residing in this Ordinary Realm?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>Famous people tended to draw crowds. It was unusual how few people there were in a realm where the famous World Spiritist Painter resided.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The natural energies in this Ordinary Realm are very thin, almost comparable to that of the Nine Provinces Continent. Most Ordinary Realms in the Totem Galaxy have a rather high concentration of natural energies, such that the only thing that really sets them apart from the Upper Realms is their land mass. It&rsquo;s likely that cultivators are shunning this place due to its scarce natural energies,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on the same level as the Nine Provinces Continent? Doesn&rsquo;t that mean that it&rsquo;s worse than the Holy Land of Martialism?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span><br><span>While the Holy Land of Martialism was located in the Nine Provinces Continent, there was a huge disparity in the concentration of their natural energies.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that there would be a place in the Totem Galaxy with such scarce natural energies.&rdquo; Eggy was surprised.</span><br><span>One of the key reasons the Ancestral Martial Galaxy had fallen into decline was the scarcity of natural energies. It was rare to see any realms outside of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy with such scarce natural energies in the vast world of cultivation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not right. There aren&rsquo;t many people around, but there seems to be quite a lot of cities here,&rdquo; Eggy remarked.</span><br><span>While they didn&rsquo;t see many local cultivators around, they did notice an increasing number of cities along the way. These cities had very few people in there; there were even a few massive cities that could easily house millions that were completely empty.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one possibility. The natural energies here used to be normal, but something has devoured them,&rdquo; Chu Feng deduced.</span><br><span>Chu Feng suddenly halted his speed as he noticed a couple of travelers discussing the matter. They were here for the exhibition too. Some of their juniors were curious to know why the natural energies here were so thin, especially as they approached Painter Mountain, and the leader of the group was answering their question.</span><br><span>It was just as Chu Feng had guessed. This Ordinary Realm&rsquo;s natural energies had started drying up at some point, and this phenomenon happened shortly after the World Spiritist Painter arrived in this realm.</span><br><span>There were rumors that the World Spiritist Painter was using the natural energies in this Ordinary Realm to nourish his painting, and this conjecture was further substantiated by how the concentration of natural energies was thinner near Painter Mountain.</span><br><span>Furthermore, this phenomenon had been observed in other places where the World Spiritist Painter had resided. It was only when the natural energies had thinned beyond a certain point that the World Spiritist Painter would move homes to somewhere else.</span><br><span>Some time later, Chu Feng finally arrived at Painter Mountain.</span><br><span>There was nothing special about Painter Mountain at first glance, but there was a powerful formation around it that only True God level cultivators or True Dragon World Spiritists could breach.</span><br><span>Due to the formation, the people who had come for the exhibition could only camp outside Painter Mountain, resulting in the area being cramped to the brim. Figures could be seen everywhere, be it on the ground or in the sky. It was almost as if everyone in this Ordinary Realm had gathered here.</span><br><span>Most of these people were normal cultivators, but Chu Feng did sense a few powerful auras. Quite a few experts had come to watch the exhibition too, though there was no one from the Totem Dragon Clan or the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.</span><br><span>Nevertheless, this showed how famous the World Spiritist Painter was.</span><br><span>However, most people were discussing the grudge between Chu Feng and Jia Lingyi instead of the upcoming exhibition. It would appear that most of them were here to watch the commotion. It was just that there were many falsehoods in their words&hellip;</span><br><span>The more normal rumors claimed that Chu Feng had a grudge against the juniors of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect that only grew larger with time.</span><br><span>The more ridiculous ones claimed that Jia Lingyi was infatuated with Chu Feng, but her feelings turned to hatred when he rejected her, prompting her to go after his life. In the end, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore and decided to exact vengeance.</span><br><span>Shockingly, there were people who believed such rumors.</span><br><span>The proliferation of baseless rumors took the attention away from Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandmother.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha, those people sure are interesting!&rdquo; Eggy was amused by all of the weird rumors going around.</span><br><span>Chu Feng could only sigh helplessly, but he wasn&rsquo;t too bothered by it. He knew that the truth would eventually come to light. He didn&rsquo;t just idle around either; he listened to the rumors while secretly scanning the area.</span><br><span>He had come here not just to deal with the Pill Dao Immortal Sect but to find his impersonator too. Unfortunately, he was unable to find any clues.</span><br><span>The crowd around Painter Mountain was exceptionally excited today, for this was the day that the World Spiritist Painter&rsquo;s exhibition would commence. The formation around Painter Mountain was finally going to be lifted.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>There was suddenly a loud reverberation in the sky as the clouds scattered. A massive floating warship appeared from the horizon. This warship was pink in color, and there were flower petals inscribed on it. Most importantly, it was flying flags bearing the name &lsquo;Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Jia Lingyi is here!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd flew into a commotion.</span><br></p></div>
