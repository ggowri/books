        <div> - Miserably Defeated Geniuses<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Compared to the others, Nangong Yifan was extremely calm. Even though he was surrounded by five people, he still acted extremely confident. In fact, the contempt in his eyes did not decrease in the slightest.<br>He did not even bother to look at the five people that had surrounded him. Instead, his gaze was on someone within the crowd of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations -- Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you not planning to join in?&rdquo; Nangong Yifan asked.<br>&ldquo;I will satisfy your desire to fight me in the future,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Although Chu Feng had a very strong demeanor, he was actually feeling quite bitter.<br>Due to eating the Sacred Tree Seed, his bloodline power had ended up waging war against it. As an indirect consequence of that, his cultivation ended up being suppressed.<br>Chu Feng was a rank three Exalted. Not to mention recovering all of his cultivation, even if he only recovered to rank two Exalted, he would still dare to fight Nangong Yifan.<br>After all, in his opinion, Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s strength was inferior to Linghu Hongfei's.<br>Unfortunately, there was nothing Chu Feng could do. His cultivation was suppressed, and Her Lady Queen and Yu Sha were both in closed-door training. Thus, Chu Feng was simply unable to contend against Nangong Yifan.<br>Even if he were to rashly stand forth, he would only take a beating from Nangong Yifan without being able to do anything.<br>Chu Feng was not afraid of humiliation. It was just that there was simply no meaning in doing such a thing.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, after hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, Nangong Yifan laughed mockingly.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d heard that you&rsquo;d managed to tie with Linghu Hongfei, and that you share the title of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s strongest genius with him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I had thought that you possessed some skills. Never would I expect that you would hole up behind this bunch of trash, afraid to fight me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that you&rsquo;re actually also trash, just like them? Are you someone who is only capable of acting mighty in the chess formation?&rdquo;<br>Nangong Yifan began to do his best to mock Chu Feng. He was trying to force Chu Feng to fight him.<br>Furthermore, he would always bring up the chess formation. It could be seen that the root cause of his hatred for Chu Feng was the humiliation he had suffered in the chess formation at Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands.<br>&ldquo;Nangong Yifan, I&rsquo;ve already said it. You are still unqualified to fight Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you want to fight him, you must first defeat us,&rdquo; said Wuming Yuanzhi.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Nangong Yifan burst into another round of laughter. This time around, he was laughing very wildly. Furthermore, his laughter was filled with contempt.<br>Suddenly, Nangong Yifan stopped his laughter, and coldness appeared in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Since you all want to disgrace yourselves, I will help you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, this time around, I do not wish to waste time.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Nangong Yifan flipped his wrist, and an enormous weapon appeared in his hand. It was a halberd.<br>The halberd measured ten meters in length. It was made entirely out of gold, and appeared extremely exquisite.<br>That was not an ordinary Incomplete Exalted Armament. The quality of that Incomplete Exalted Armament was superb. Its quality surpassed the Incomplete Exalted Armaments of Kong Ci, Long Ning, Xian Yun, Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo.<br>With such an Incomplete Exalted Armament in hand, Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s battle power increased greatly.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, Nangong Yifan swept out with his giant halberd and sent forth dazzling golden slashes towards the five.<br>At practically the same time, Kong Ci, Long Ning, Xian Yun, Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo&rsquo;s bodies started to shine. They brandished their weapons and attacked Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s incoming attack.<br>In the blink of an eye, the six people collided.<br>However, to the crowd&rsquo;s astonishment...<br>The battle that the crowd had placed high hopes in showed no suspense.<br>In merely a few bouts, Kong Ci, Long Ning, Xian Yun, Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo were all sent flying, crashing to the ground.<br>Not only had they fallen to the ground, but their bodies were also covered in bloody injuries.<br>All of them were seriously injured!!!<br>The crowd were all astonished. Even Lord Shoujian had a serious look on his face.<br>The possibility that the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s five geniuses might not be a match for Nangong Yifan even if they joined hands had crossed their minds before.<br>However, none of them had expected them to be defeated so quickly and miserably.<br>When even the bystanders were unable to accept it, how could the five proud and confident geniuses that were admired by others possibly accept such a result?<br>At that moment, Kong Ci, Long Ning, Xian Yun, Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo were completely dumbfounded. They had lifeless expressions on their faces and flickering eyes. They were all unable to accept the result before them.<br>At that moment, all the pride and honor that they possessed was shattered.<br>Before this, they had all challenged Nangong Yifan before.<br>Although they were all refused by him, none of them had really believed themselves to be inferior to him.<br>However, they had come to realize why Nangong Yifan had refused their challenges. It turned out that the disparity between them and Nangong Yifan was truly enormous.<br>They were simply no match for him at all.<br>Even though their cultivations were the same and they all possessed techniques capable of increasing their cultivation by three levels, Nangong Yifan was on a completely different level.<br>They had thought of the possibility of losing. However, they'd never imagined that they would be defeated so miserably.<br>That said, Nangong Yifan was not someone who would bother to care what the five of them were feeling at that moment. He sneered and then walked over to Wuming Yuanzhi.<br>&ldquo;Them, I can spare.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However you, you will have to pay for your actions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Nangong Yifan raised the halberd and planned to pierce it into Wuming Yuanzhi&rsquo;s body.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, after raising his halberd, Nangong Yifan was unable to bring it down. An enormous power had bound him.<br>It was Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Nangong Yifan, it is only a spar. You should stop when the outcome is determined.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If one is to lose, then one must be willing to take their losses with grace. If one is to win, one must win honorably. To use sparring as a justification to take one&rsquo;s opponent&rsquo;s life is not something that an upright person of noble character should do,&rdquo; said Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to side with him?&rdquo; Nangong Yifan asked coldly. He had never had any respect for Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;No, I am not siding with him. Rather, I am upholding the rules of this place,&rdquo; said Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Nangong Yifan let out a cold snort. Then, he looked to Wuming Yuanzhi, &ldquo;Remember, while someone might be able to protect you now, that doesn't necessarily mean they will be able to protect you your entire life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I do not care what sort of status your Wuming Clan possesses in the eyes of the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In my eyes, you are nothing more than an ant.&rdquo;<br>After Nangong Yifan finished saying those words, he retrieved the halberd in his hand.<br>The flame armor on his body also began to dissipate.<br>The disappearance of the flame armor was not caused by Nangong Yifan. Rather, it was disappearing on its own.<br>After the flame armor disappeared, Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s cultivation not only returned to rank four Exalted from rank five Exalted, but his complexion also became slightly pale.<br>Although he had increased his cultivation by a level through the use of his treasure, it remained that it was not his own ability.<br>Treasures would generally have a time limit for how long they could be active, and would generally also cause a certain amount of backlash.<br>In fact, it was not only Nangong Yifan. Wuming Yuanzhi and the other&rsquo;s cultivations were also waning. The treasures that they'd used to increase their cultivations had all reached their limit.<br>However, compared to Wuming Yuanzhi and the others, Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s complexion was much better.<br>Wuming Yuanzhi and the others appeared extremely weak. Although their treasures had managed to increase their cultivations, they had also brought a lot of suffering upon them.<br></p></div>
