        <div> - Cannot Stay<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Why should we tell you where we&rsquo;re from and what our names are?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Could you be planning to eradicate us and kill our families too?&rdquo; sneered Fumo Shaoyu.<br>Even though the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s attitude was very good, he responded with a very bad attitude.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, my son is stubborn and mischievous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I know that it must be my son who was in the wrong, and offended you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rest assured. I will punish him severely, and return justice to you all,&rdquo; said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re planning to return justice to us, then it would not only be teaching your son a lesson,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, please go ahead and tell me what you want then,&rdquo; said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;You must be the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, right?&rdquo; asked Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;I am indeed the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief,&rdquo; said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good then. I can disregard the matter of your son kidnapping my lil sis.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you must provide us with an explanation about the matter regarding your Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen stealing the treasure from my brother and I,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;My Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansman stealing your treasure?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;May I know who did that?&rdquo; asked the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;I seem to recall his name was Zuoqiu Hanxun.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He stole a lightning pearl my brother and I found.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That lightning pearl is a cultivation treasure that&rsquo;s of enormous use to my brother,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;That lightning pearl was actually yours?&rdquo;<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief felt very surprised to hear those words.<br>He'd had no idea that that lightning pearl was something Zuoqiu Hanxun had snatched from someone else.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you know of the lightning pearl,&rdquo; Fumo Shaoyu narrowed his brows. The displeasure on his face grew even more intense.<br>&ldquo;I do know of the lightning pearl. However, I had no idea that it was something Elder Hanxun had plundered from you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about this: young friend, please follow me back.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If what you all say is the truth, I will definitely settle things for you,&rdquo; said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s forget about it. It&rsquo;s nothing major. Let&rsquo;s just drop it,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>He did not wish to continue to tangle with the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan, and wanted to quickly leave this place.<br>&ldquo;Forget about it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could we possibly forget about it? That treasure belonged to us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They must provide us with an explanation,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, please rest assured. My Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan is not an unreasonable clan. If really is my clansman that was in the wrong, I will definitely provide you all with a justification,&rdquo; said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. His attitude was extremely cordial.<br>With the situation being like that, it was unsuitable for Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings to refuse him.<br>Besides, Fumo Shaoyu was determined to get an explanation.<br>As such, they followed the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>As soon as they returned to the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation they caught sight of Zuoqiu Hanxun again.<br>Zuoqiu Hanxun was rather surprised to see Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu.<br>Upon learning what had happened, he became even more surprised.<br>What had happened between them could be described with a single phrase -- enemies running into each other on a narrow road!<br>That said, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief turned out to really be a reasonable person.<br>Upon confirming that Zuoqiu Hanxun&rsquo;s lightning pearl had indeed been plundered from Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu, he immediately had Zuoqiu Hanxun apologize to them.<br>Although Zuoqiu Hanxun was very unwilling, he didn&rsquo;t dare oppose his Lord Clan Chief, and really ended up apologizing to Chu Feng and Fumo Shaoyu.<br>That said, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did not plan to return the lightning pearl to Chu Feng.<br>The reason for that was because he needed it to activate the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>Activating the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation required a lot of natural treasures. Of those treasures, the most important ones would be those related to Heavenly Bloodlines.<br>The lightning pearl would be crucial to the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>Because of that, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief proposed something else instead.<br>He proposed to have Chu Feng enter the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation with Zuoqiu Tiancheng so that they could enjoy the power of the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation together.<br>Fumo Shaoyu felt that this proposal was fair.<br>Because of that, they agreed on it.<br>After they came to a decision, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief ordered his men to treat Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings as distinguished guests, and set up arrangements for them in the temporary palaces.<br>After Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings left, the others also left in succession.<br>With that, only the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Zuoqiu Hanxun remained in the palace.<br>Finally, Zuoqiu Hanxun voiced his confusion.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, we&rsquo;ve prepared for the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation for so long.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if that lightning pearl is of considerable value, it&rsquo;s actually not that important.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re worried about their origin, we might as well return the lightning pearl to them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you really planning to have him enter the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation together with young master?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that that child&rsquo;s origin is so great and his backing is so powerful that even our Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan would have to curry favor with him?&rdquo; asked Zuoqiu Hanxun.<br>&ldquo;Those three people of the younger generation all possess extraordinary talent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I suspect that their origins are not that powerful. Likely, they&rsquo;re geniuses from certain minor powers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, they wouldn&rsquo;t have refused to mention what power they belonged to,&rdquo; said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, then this subordinate is even more confused,&rdquo; Zuoqiu Hanxun had a confused look on his face.<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did not answer directly. Instead, he smiled with complacence before saying, &ldquo;Elder Hanxun, there&rsquo;s no need to bother choosing a Lightning Guide from the clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, could it be&hellip;&rdquo; Zuoqiu Hanxun&rsquo;s expression changed enormously upon hearing those words.<br>Then, a sinister smile replaced the puzzled look on his face.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief is truly brilliant,&rdquo; Zuoqiu Hanxun bowed to the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Zuoqiu Hanxun had realized what their Lord Clan Chief intended to do.<br>However, soon, a trace of hesitation appeared on his smile-filled face.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, with how exceptionally talented those three youngsters are, especially that Chu Feng, who&rsquo;s not only a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist possessing the Dragon Transformation Sensation, but also someone who triggered nine colored lightning on the Bloodline Testing Stone, a sign that his talent is extremely terrifying; they are rare geniuses in the entire Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Would geniuses like them, especially that Chu Feng, be from minor powers?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What if that Chu Feng is from some colossal power? If that&rsquo;s the case and we end up using him as the Lightning Guide&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that we&rsquo;ll have brought a major disaster upon ourselves?&rdquo;<br>It turned out that Zuoqiu Hanxun&rsquo;s hesitation was not about whether or not Chu Feng would live, but whether or not he had a major power backing him.<br>He was afraid that they&rsquo;d end up courting unnecessary troubles.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured. My eyesight is extremely accurate. That sort of possibility is practically nonexistent,&rdquo; the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said with a look of confidence.<br>After hearing his Lord Clan Chief put it like that, Zuoqiu Hanxun's worries eased considerably.<br>He believed in his Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s judgement.<br>&hellip;&hellip;...<br>Whilst Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings had lodgings arranged for them by the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan, they were not separated.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had something to say to the Fumo siblings.<br>&ldquo;We cannot stay in this place. We must leave at once,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
