        <div>: Snatching the Slots<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, do you really not remember it anymore?&rdquo; Song Yun asked once more.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t remember a thing at all, but my memories seem to stop at the point where I came under attack. It&rsquo;s impossible for me to have defeated that creature in the world inside the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl, so something else must have happened. Did you notice anything peculiar after you regained consciousness?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He didn&rsquo;t think that he was the one who saved Song Yun and obtained the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl. If he really did so, he should have some memories of it.<br>He felt that someone might have helped them in the shadows.<br>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t see anything at all. The only one I saw was you, and I found the Divine Rejuvenation Pearl in your hand too.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you must have been through something that caused you to lose your memories. I&rsquo;m just glad to see that you aren&rsquo;t injured anywhere. Perhaps we should just give it some time. Maybe you&rsquo;ll remember something after a while.<br>&ldquo;But still, I think I should thank you properly. If not for your help, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to obtain the pearl,&rdquo; Song Yun said gratefully.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to be so courteous with me!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng chuckled softly before he began scanning his surroundings once more. He wanted to find some clues as to what that had happened earlier.<br>Dang!<br>Dang!<br>Dang!<br>All of a sudden, the tolls of a bell chimed from the sky above.<br>Following that, the resounding voice of an old man sounded. It was transmitted through the power of a formation, allowing it to reach every nook and cranny inside the Incubation Forest without any trouble.<br>It was just that the one who spoke this time around wasn&rsquo;t the white-bearded world spiritist but an anonymous elder.<br>This elder declared that the time for the first trial had ended, and those who had failed to collect the necessary keys and pass through the barrier would all be eliminated. On the other hand, those who had passed through the barrier like Chu Feng were eligible to challenge the second trial.<br>The second trial was much harder than the first.<br>After those who had been eliminated in the first trial were teleported out of the Incubation Forest, the barrier that divided this area into two would vanish. A huge map would appear above the forest.<br>The challengers could follow the clues provided by the map to find three spirit formation gates. Those who managed to enter the spirit formation gate and take control of the formation inside would be deemed to have cleared the examination, granting them a slot to participate in the matchmaking convention.<br>There was no time limit to the examination this time around, but there were only three slots available. Once all three formations had been taken, those who had failed to control any formations at all would be eliminated.<br>After the old man explained the details of the trial, a brilliant light shone from the sky above, revealing a massive map above the woods. The location of the three spirit formation gates was hidden inside this map.<br>&ldquo;Right now, we just have to wait till we&rsquo;re eliminated to get out of this darned place.&rdquo;<br>Song Yun shot a glance at the map above before remarking with a smile.<br>On the other hand, Chu Feng began examining the map carefully. He activated Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes and swiftly scanned through the map.<br>Soon enough, his grave expression was replaced with a light smile. He quickly channeled his spirit power to create a concealment formation around Song Yun in order to hide her presence from others.<br>He turned to Song Yun and said, &ldquo;Stay here for the time being. After you&rsquo;re eliminated, you should return back home obediently.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you can&rsquo;t be thinking of participating in the matchmaking convention too, are you?&rdquo;<br>Someone of Song Yun&rsquo;s wits couldn&rsquo;t possibly be unable to figure out Chu Feng&rsquo;s intent.<br>&ldquo;I wish to give it a try,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied frankly.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, I know that this is a good opportunity, but you need to get a hold of yourself. Your opponents aren&rsquo;t just the prodigies in the Incubation Forest; there are more formidable people outside participating in the matchmaking convention too! You aren&rsquo;t a match for them!&rdquo;<br>Song Yun tried to dissuade him.<br>&ldquo;Silly girl,what are you talking about? Do I look like the type of person to be interested in a matchmaking convention? I&rsquo;m just interested in the Asura Graveyard. Based on what that elder from before said, it looks like I&rsquo;ll be allowed to approach the Asura Graveyard if I can win the slot to the matchmaking convention.<br>&ldquo;I just want to give it a try. Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t put myself at risk over this. As soon as things get dangerous, I&rsquo;ll back down right away,&rdquo; Chu Feng explained.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re insane! The Asura Graveyard is even more dangerous than the matchmaking convention. Can you not go there?&rdquo;<br>Song Yun dashed out of the formation and grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm. She tried her best to pull Chu Feng back into the concealment formation, hoping that he would give up on the matchmaking convention.<br>&ldquo;Stop messing around. I&rsquo;ve already found the location of the spirit formation gate. I can&rsquo;t afford to waste any time here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;If you insist on going&hellip; I&rsquo;ll go with you too then!&rdquo; Song Yun insisted.<br>&ldquo;Stop being so obstinate and stay here. You&rsquo;ll be safer here,&rdquo; Chu Feng persuaded her.<br>&ldquo;No! Unless you take me with you, I won&rsquo;t let you go!&rdquo; Song Yun insistently held onto Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm as she said stubbornly.<br></p></div>
