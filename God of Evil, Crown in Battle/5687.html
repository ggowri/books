        <h1>Chapter 5687: Instant Killing the Strongest God-cloak World Spiritist</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You have such a world spirit?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span> was taken aback by the Asura King&rsquo;s appearance. He could tell that the Asura King was at pinnacle Half-God level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Audacious! Prepare to die!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any hesitation, the Asura King unleashed a gigantic fist manifested out of his black aura toward Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span>, only for it to dissipate before it could reach its target. It turned out that a barrier around Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span> had blocked the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hahahaha!&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span> burst into laughter. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to you than I thought, young friend Chu Feng! How can someone of your cultivation have such a world spirit? It looks like I have chosen the right person here. My Divine Pill might just be perfected because of you!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span> cackled as he waved his cane, releasing a powerful wave of spirit power at the Asura King. The Asura King quickly retaliated with his martial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them were so powerful that Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes couldn&rsquo;t keep up with the battle at all. He could only barely perceive it with his other senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Much to his astonishment, Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span> was terrifyingly powerful despite looking as if he was on his deathbed. His abilities to control his spirit power and construct formations were incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Asura King was able to hold his ground at the start, but it didn&rsquo;t take long for him to fall into a disadvantageous position. He had already thrown out everything he could, but Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span> was only getting started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not an </span><span>exaggerationthat</span><span> Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span> was honored to be the strongest world spiritist beneath True Dragon. The Asura King was going to be defeated at this rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng opened the gate in his World Spirit Space. Millions of black lights surged out and fused into the Asura King&rsquo;s body, greatly boosting his fighting prowess. The Asura World Spirit Army had constructed a formation inside the World Spirit Space to strengthen the Asura King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> eyes gleamed even brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;So many Asura World Spirits who are stronger than you willingly submitted to you? Young friend Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re stoking my excitement. I&rsquo;m more confident of perfecting my Divine Pill now!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> attacks became even more aggressive, as he constructed all sorts of formations. The Asura King, despite being reinforced by the Asura World Spirit Army, was still unable to rival the pinnacle God-cloak Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, why don&rsquo;t I entrust my strength to you?&rdquo; the Asura King asked via voice transmission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng shared the same thoughts too, but he thought that it would be inappropriate for him to raise it from his side since the Asura King was the Asura World Spirit Army&rsquo;s leader. However, now that the Asura King had proposed it, there was no reason for him to turn down the offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, after all. Complications could arise if the battle dragged out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Entrust your strength to me then, elder,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Asura King quickly returned to the World Spirit Space, but the gate remained open. The Asura World Spirit Army&rsquo;s power was channeled into Chu Feng instead. A black aura billowed around Chu Feng, as his cultivation was raised to rank nine Half-God level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was borrowing the Asura King&rsquo;s power, he couldn&rsquo;t use his own means to raise his cultivation. It was also harder to utilize the borrowed power than his own, evident from how he previously couldn&rsquo;t use any martial skills with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the recent strengthening of his psyche had boosted his world spiritist techniques, allowing him to better use the borrowed powers. This allowed him to freely use his martial skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hm? What are you doing?&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span> eyed Chu Feng intently instead of making a move. &ldquo;Am I seeing things? That world spirit actually lent his powers to you? Does he not know that world spiritists aren&rsquo;t adept in the means of a cultivator?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span> looked at Chu Feng as if he was helpless prey. He was enjoying the hunt, especially since he was confident of victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Your formations are peculiar. Those are from Heaven&rsquo;s Tome, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng knew that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had a book known as Heaven&rsquo;s Tome. The formations inside the book were difficult to construct, but they were exceptionally powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why struggle in vain if you know that much?&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Your control over your spirit power is formidable, not to mention that you have familiarized yourself with many of the formations inside Heaven&rsquo;s Tome over the long years you have lived. You are indeed a formidable adversary. If there was time, I would have wanted to have a serious fight with you. However, I want to end it fast today,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he whipped out the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;An Exalted Armament? Can you even use it?&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span> sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> smile froze in place. A sword had pierced through his neck, and blood spurted from his throat. Chu Feng, who should have been standing a distance away from him, had suddenly vanished and stabbed him from behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> eyes widened in bewilderment. He couldn&rsquo;t understand how Chu Feng had suddenly appeared behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Have you heard of divine skills?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> face hardened in determination, but moments later, his eyes widened in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had tried to invoke his protection formation, but it wasn&rsquo;t working. He lowered his gaze and saw a weird suction force coming from Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm. That was the culprit neutralizing Ling </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could a mere junior neutralize the overwhelmingly powerful protection formation inside him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Who in the world are you? Why did you come to our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?!&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span> screamed with his hoarse voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Have you ever asked the person you assimilated who they are?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as </span><span>he decapitated Ling </span><span>Canghai</span><span> with a single slash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Ling </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> head rolled off its neck, several formation chains swiftly shot out from his body to envelop the area where Chu Feng was. Fortunately, with the strength he had borrowed from the Asura King and Divine Flitting, Chu Feng could move at a speed comparable to rank two True God level cultivators.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he realized that Ling </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> body had been sealed in place by the formation chains. He could neither access Ling </span><span>Canghai&rsquo;s</span><span> body nor move it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He still has another formation?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart clenched up as he realized that things had gone awry.</span></p></div>
