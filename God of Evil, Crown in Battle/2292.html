        <div> - Must Die<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Big brother Luotang, what is going on here? Exactly what sort of origin does that Chu Feng possess?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He killed big brother Luyang. It would be one thing for the Sunset Cloud Valley to not avenge big brother Luyang, but why would they instead offer their support to that Chu Feng? Furthermore, why would the Three Stars Hall also be involved in this?&rdquo;<br>Feeling confused, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen present all turned their gazes to Chu Luotang.<br>They all knew that it was not a coincidence that Chu Feng had obtained that sort of treatment, and began to suspect that Chu Feng might be of extraordinary origin, that he was not someone to be trifled with.<br>After pondering for some time, Chu Luotang said, &ldquo;It would appear that the news from Mount Cloud Crane is true.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What news?&rdquo; Someone asked in confusion.<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng is a genius world spiritist. On Mount Cloud Crane, in that Immortalization Assembly held by Golden Crane True Immortal, Chu Feng defeated all the expert world spiritists gathered and became an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,&rdquo; someone explained.<br>&ldquo;Ah? According to the information we have, that Chu Feng should be quite young. He has become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist at such a young age?&rdquo; After knowing about what happened, many of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen revealed astonished expressions.<br>The reason for that was because that news was not good news at all.<br>&ldquo;But even if he is an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, there shouldn&rsquo;t be a reason for the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall to try to win him over like that, no?&rdquo; someone voiced their confusion.<br>&ldquo;If he were only an ordinary Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, that would naturally be the case.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist as young as Chu Feng would definitely be worthy. In the eyes of the people of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, the fact that a member of the younger generation is capable of accomplishing what Chu Feng has means that his future potential is so enormous that it cannot be measured,&rdquo; Chu Luotang said.<br>A female member of the Chu Heavenly Clan who was already several hundred years old yet still had the appearance of a young girl said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I have also heard that Chu Feng is not only an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, but also an Asura World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Asura World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>After hearing that, some of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen revealed even uglier expressions.<br>No matter what, they were people from the Chu Heavenly Clan. As such, they were all people that had a lot of experience, and had seen great things before. As such, they knew very well that the title of an Asura World Spiritist was much more powerful than that of an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! Could it be that big brother Luyang will have to die in vain like this?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan present were all at a loss as for what to do. Although they all wanted to avenge Chu Luyang, they did not possess sufficient strength to do so.<br>None of them were fools. They all realized that the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall would definitely protect someone of Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent.<br>After all, the Three Stars Hall and the Sunset Cloud Valley were already willing to wage war against the Ying Heavenly Clan for Chu Feng.<br>Thus, not to mention that they did not possess the strength to kill Chu Feng, even if they were capable of killing Chu Feng, the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall would also not be willing to let them get away with it.<br>At that moment, they all felt that obtaining revenge for Chu Luyang would be hopeless.<br>&ldquo;Why are you all panicking? Have you all forgotten the purpose in Chu Luyang&rsquo;s coming to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?&rdquo; Chu Luotang said.<br>&ldquo;What was his purpose?&rdquo; The people from the Chu Heavenly Clan expressed their confusion.<br>&ldquo;It was for his younger brother, Chu Luxuan,&rdquo; Chu Luotang said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Luxuan,&rdquo; Hearing that name, the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan, regardless of whether they were young or old, all revealed a change in expression.<br>Although some among them had left the Chu Heavenly Clan for hundreds of years now, they were still extremely familiar with the name Chu Luxuan.<br>As for the people of the younger generation that ended up coming to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm afterwards, the name &lsquo;Chu Luxuan&rsquo; was even more profound in their hearts.<br>Chu Luxuan was still a member of the younger generation. However, the status that he held in the Chu Heavenly Clan was absolutely not something that they could compare with.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Luxuan possessed a superb talent for martial cultivation. His extraordinary status had been decided since the moment he was born.<br>Even in their powerful clan filled with geniuses, Chu Luxuan was someone who was acknowledged.<br>&ldquo;The reason why Chu Luyang came to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm was actually because he wanted to pave the road for his brother. The reason for that was because he knew that his brother would, sooner or later, come to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to conduct missions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you all think that Chu Luxuan, Chu Luyang&rsquo;s blood brother, will ignore the matter of his brother&rsquo;s death?&rdquo; Chu Luotang asked.<br>&ldquo;He would definitely not. Although I have only met that Chu Luxuan twice, he is certainly not someone to be trifled with,&rdquo; A member of the younger generation said.<br>&ldquo;There we go. Although there is nothing we can do about that Chu Feng right now, when Chu Luxuan arrives in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, it will be the descent of misfortune for that Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Luotang said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. No matter how exceptionally talented Chu Feng might be, how could he possibly be able to match the geniuses of our Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When Chu Luxuan arrives at this place, there will definitely be countless powers that will try to curry favor with him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, what could that Chu Feng possibly amount to? Once Chu Luxuan gives the order, countless powers will shield Chu Luxuan and attack Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, even the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall will not dare to shield Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan once again saw hope for vengeance.<br>The way they saw it, if Chu Luxuan wished to take care of Chu Feng, there would be no hope for Chu Feng at all. Without a doubt, he would be killed.<br>After all, Chu Luxuan was an actual genius of their Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>To these people, they felt that a genius from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm would definitely not be able to compare to a genius like their Chu Luxuan.<br>Suddenly, a man asked, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Big brother Luotang, I&rsquo;ve heard that Chu Feng is also a possessor of a Heavenly Bloodline. Furthermore, his talent is pretty decent too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Moreover, he is surnamed Chu. He couldn&rsquo;t possibly be a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan, right?&rdquo;<br>When that man asked those words, he had a slightly worried expression in his eyes.<br>The reason why he was worried was because Chu Feng was an Asura World Spiritist.<br>Regardless of how talented that Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent for martial cultivation might be, his mere identity as an Asura World Spiritist was already extremely extraordinary.<br>If that Chu Feng were to truly be a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan, then, for no other reason other than the fact that he was an Asura World Spiritist, the Chu Heavenly Clan would focus on his nurture.<br>As for those people whose nurture was the focus of the Chu Heavenly Clan, they were not people that they could afford to provoke.<br>&ldquo;Impossible. How could someone that disgraceful appear in our Chu Heavenly Clan? Furthermore, I&rsquo;ve never heard of an Asura World Spiritist appearing among our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation,&rdquo; Chu Luotang said resolutely.<br>&ldquo;In that case, that Chu Feng should be a bastard child from a certain Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm&rsquo;s Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; After hearing what Chu Luotang said, that man revealed a relieved expression.<br>&ldquo;It is one thing for him to be a bastard child. However, he actually dared to deliberately change his surname to our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s surname. He is truly shameless. Exactly how deeply did he want to become a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; Some of the people of the younger generation present started to mock Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;There are countless shameless individuals in the world. People like Chu Feng who want to claim a connection to our Chu Heavenly Clan are not rare either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, regardless, that Chu Feng must pay for his conduct and deeds. Our Chu Heavenly Clan is not a clan that just anyone can provoke,&rdquo; Chu Luotang said.<br>The others from the Chu Heavenly Clan all nodded at his words.<br>Although they were merely a bunch with the lowest tier status in the Chu Heavenly Clan, they still felt great pride in being members of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>They felt that there were no powers capable of contending against the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>That there was no one capable of contending against the experts of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Thus, regardless of where they might be, all those that dared to offend the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan must be killed.<br><br></p></div>
