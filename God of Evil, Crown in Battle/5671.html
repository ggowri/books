        <h1>Chapter 5671: End of the Trial</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder Monstrous Beast God, are you still ailing from the injuries you sustained back then?&rdquo; the woman with divine eyes asked concernedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so many years. I&rsquo;m not that weak. I have long recovered!&rdquo; The colossal beast was slightly miffed by that question, so he sneered, &ldquo;Have you not recovered from your injuries yet, Spirit God?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, I have not recovered yet,&rdquo; the woman with divine eyes replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colossal beast was taken aback by that answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder Monstrous Beast God, the Nine Heavens Secret Domain is not the same as before. Despite my attempts to repair it, it remains deficient. It&rsquo;s unlikely anyone aside from Chu Feng will be able to enter the Conqueror Domain. Why don&rsquo;t we eliminate some of the Immemorial Origin Beasts so as to lighten your burden?&rdquo; the woman with divine eyes asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Those things might be vile, but they are invaluable treasures. It&rsquo;s a waste to eliminate them just like that. I can still suppress them even if I have gotten old. That being said, I&rsquo;m grateful for your concern, Spirit God,&rdquo; the colossal beast replied with a much gentler voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good to hear,&rdquo; the woman with divine eyes said. She pinched her fingers together, and a golden talisman appeared out of thin air and floated toward the black-armored man. &ldquo;</span><span>Blacksoul</span><span>, squeeze this talisman if you ever require help.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman with divine eyes then left the cliff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black-armored man glanced at the talisman in his hand before he turned toward the abyss and asked, &ldquo;Milord, Lord Spirit God&hellip; has let go of what happened back then, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I still don&rsquo;t think that I made the wrong choice back then,&rdquo; the colossal beast replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Milord, do you think that Chu Feng will be different?&rdquo; the black-armored man asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Milord, Chu Feng has strength, courage, and wits; he&rsquo;s worthy to be deemed number one of his age </span><span>group</span><span>. He&rsquo;s loyal to his friends but merciless to his enemies. He&rsquo;s a rather extreme person in that regard, but he&rsquo;s decisive. I believe that he has the qualities to become someone great,&rdquo; the black-armored man said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be back in due time. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before we see his true colors, so let&rsquo;s continue observing for the time being,&rdquo; the colossal beast said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng and Fu Xing left the Nine Heavens Secret Domain and made their way to the other side of the mountain range, where an exit gate was located.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The exit gate resembled the entrance gate, shaped like a sword that was less than thirty meters in width but ten thousand meters in height. This gate was one-directional, meaning that one could only leave but not enter the mountain range </span><span>through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng felt triumphant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had uncovered the secret of the Nine Heavens Secret Domain that no one else knew about. This place would remain an enigma to others, but he would likely be frequenting this place in the future. Even though the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had constructed a formation around the place and stationed guards in the vicinity, that wouldn&rsquo;t stop him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had greater authority over the Nine Heavens Secret Domain than them now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t even have to enter the Nine Heavens Secret Domain through its entrance; he could teleport into it just by forming hand seals in its vicinity. He could also bring people in if he wanted to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his reward was not only the secret of the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. The Immemorial Meditation Method was not to be made light of too. In fact, it would probably be more valuable to him right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Look at the imprint on young hero Chu Feng&rsquo;s body!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exclamations echoed, and many figures flew forth from the distant palace. These were the people who had cleared the Nine Heavens Secret Domain&rsquo;s trial; some of them had been under Chu Feng&rsquo;s protection, but there were also those who cleared them with their own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were astonished too, especially when they saw the black imprints on Chu Feng and Fu Xing&rsquo;s bodies. This was the first time they were seeing the black imprint, and it was clearly stronger than the purple imprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This showed that Chu Feng and Fu Xing had achieved more in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain than they had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a person descended from the sky. It was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friends, sincere congratulations on clearing our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s entrance examination. We&rsquo;ll have to wait a little longer for the other young friends before making our way back to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. For the time being, why don&rsquo;t you rest inside one of the palaces?&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another two elders from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion landed beside Chu Feng and Fu Xing to guide them to the temporarily constructed palaces to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Chu Feng had expected, the two of them were brought to different palaces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The first place for the entrance examination should be between them, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Incredible. We have to share the palaces in groups of ten, but the two of them got their own palaces.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd, unaware of the truth, was envious of them, but Chu Feng and Fu Xing knew why the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion wanted to separate them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after Chu Feng entered one of the palaces, an elderly voice echoed from the doorway, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, is it convenient for me to pay you a visit right now?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice belonged not to Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> but Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span>, who was another Saint-tier elder in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. He had appeared with Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> </span><span>during the first trial to redress his grievances when the test administrator took advantage of him by tampering with his result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his prejudice, Chu Feng had a good opinion of Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> and Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span>. Thus, he bowed to Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> and said, &ldquo;Junior pays respect to Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span>.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be one family too. You may spare with the formalities,&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> replied with a smile before heading in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng tactfully closed the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> took a seat and gestured to him, saying, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, take a seat too. There are no outsiders here. You don&rsquo;t have to be so restrained.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> started with some idle chatter before proceeding to ask about Chu Feng&rsquo;s experience in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain. He wanted to see if Chu Feng had gathered any information about the remnant that was previously unknown to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng answered the questions as planned. He noticed that Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> was discreetly using some kind of special observation skill to discern if he was lying, but it was to no avail as he flawlessly answered every question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting the information he wanted, Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> was just about to leave when he stopped right before the entrance, turned around, and looked at Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion only takes in those who are able to pull their weight. The trial was brutal, but it had to be done. You possess exceptional talent. As long as you&rsquo;re sincere about joining our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, you can be certain that we will not let you down.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words were intended to dispel any negative impression Chu Feng had of their Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, as well as an unofficial declaration that he was qualified to join their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> took his leave and rose into the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> flitted beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you done with your questioning?&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes. What about you?&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why else would I be here?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Come, let&rsquo;s match our answers to see if there are any discrepancies.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> off, Chu Feng closed the door, walked into the center of the palace, and sat down. He believed that Fu Xing had the means to dupe them, so he wasn&rsquo;t worried that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion would sense that something was amiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he decided to make use of his free time to cultivate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had obtained a huge benefit from the Immemorial Meditation Method the first time he practiced it, but he hadn&rsquo;t had the time to test it out yet. Now that he had some time on his hands, he wanted to see if the benefit from the Immemorial Meditation Method met his expectations.</span></p></div>
