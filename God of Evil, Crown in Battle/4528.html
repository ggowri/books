        <div>: Change In Identity<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After tossing the woman onto the ground, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t bother with her anymore. Despite so, the woman still frantically scrambled to her feet, falling to her ground a few times before she finally managed to rise into the air and disappear into the horizon.<br>The way she fled frantically for her life felt extremely exhilarating to the crowd from the Starfall Holy Land.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, thank you for your help!&rdquo;<br>It was then that the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master led the elders and disciples of the Starfall Holy Land forward to voice their gratitude toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Lord? Elders, there&rsquo;s no need to address me with such courtesy. You can just address me as Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t used to being addressed in such a manner by these people.<br>This was especially with the people he was familiar with, such as the Starfall Eight Immortals. They had helped him previously, and Chu Feng had always treated and respected them as elders. It felt weird for their relationship to change just because he had gotten a little stronger.<br>And upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, the crowd from the Starfall Holy Land also quickly changed the way they addressed Chu Feng too.<br>That being said, they were still unable to drop the respectful tone that they took when talking to him.<br>That made Chu Feng realize that it was impossible for their relationship to go back to how it was like in the past anymore. It was an inevitable change resulting from the disparity in their strength.<br>Following that, Chu Feng chatted with them for a bit.<br>The others asked about the sudden disappearance of the Chu Heavenly Clan, and Chu Feng simply told them that there was no need to worry about it.<br>Amidst their idle chatter, Chu Feng also learned the reason why those from the Starfall Holy Land were at the Ancestral Martial Dragon City. It turned out that it wasn&rsquo;t just the Starfall Holy Land that was here; all of the major powers of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were all here.<br>The Ancestral Martial Dragon City had invited all of them here.<br>And the reason why they were able to open the remnant was also due to the key that the Ancestral Martial Dragon City had given them too.<br>To put it plainly, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City had given the various powers of the Ancestral Martial Starfield some sort of benefit, distributing their cultivation resources amongst them.<br>The only difference was that the cultivation resources weren&rsquo;t just handed to these powers on a platter, but rather, the powers had to obtain them with their own hands.<br>After learning of the current situation surrounding the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, Chu Feng soon bade his farewell and prepared to take his leave. He had some matters to attend to at the moment, so he couldn&rsquo;t afford to chat with them for too long.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, please wait a moment.&rdquo;<br>But just as Chu Feng was about to leave, the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master suddenly stopped Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Elder Holy Master, is there something up?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little worried for you. The Flying Feather Heavenly Sect is not a native power of our Ancestral Martial Starfield. Rather, it&rsquo;s an esteemed guest invited here by the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have much of an understanding regarding the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, but based on the information I have gathered, it would appear that they have an Utmost Exalted level expert in their midst. In terms of fighting prowess, they wouldn&rsquo;t pale in comparison to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City at all.<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, I saw the way how those from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City interacted with those from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, and they were incredibly polite. It&rsquo;s already beyond how friends would address one another.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, I know that you have a close relationship with City Master Long of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, and the person you injured earlier was just a disciple of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect.<br>&ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s for certain that the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect is no pushover, and their main force is currently situated within the Ancestral Martial Dragon City. If you are intent on heading over to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, I&rsquo;ve to ask you to pay careful heed,&rdquo; the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master told Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng simply smiled lightly and replied, &ldquo;Elder Holy Master, there&rsquo;s no need to worry. Nothing will happen to me.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng rose into the air and began making his way toward the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.<br>Even after Chu Feng left, the crowd from the Starfall Holy Land didn&rsquo;t enter the remnant right away. Instead, they looked in the direction Chu Feng had departed toward with contemplative looks on their faces.<br>&ldquo;Lord Holy Master, are you able to discern what young hero Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation is at the moment?&rdquo; the Starfall Eight Immortals asked.<br>The Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master shook his head and replied, &ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation surpasses mine by far too much. I&rsquo;m unable to grasp just how powerful he is anymore. However, I can sense that he has advanced considerably from before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While we were having great difficulties trying to achieve just a single breakthrough in our cultivation, he&rsquo;s able to make great leaps forward every single time we meet&hellip; I guess this is the disparity between us and a true prodigy.&rdquo;<br>The Starfall Eight Immortals couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a little disheartened.<br>Many of them present had seen how Chu Feng was when he was weaker. Back then, many of them were stronger than the latter, but before they knew it, the latter had already grown to become a powerhouse whom all powers of the Ancestral Martial Starfield feared deeply.<br>Their Starfall Holy Land was really nothing much before Chu Feng at all.<br>&ldquo;Yun&rsquo;er, you have to work hard. Back then, you were a prodigy of the same standing as Chu Feng,&rdquo; the Starfall Eight Immortals suddenly turned to Xia Yun&rsquo;er and said.<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er, who was still deep in thought after Chu Feng&rsquo;s departure, couldn&rsquo;t help but sigh deeply upon hearing those words. She murmured lightly beneath her breath, &ldquo;I probably won&rsquo;t be able to catch up with him in my entire lifetime.&rdquo;<br>Thinking back, the first time she met Chu Feng, the latter couldn&rsquo;t even hold a candle to her at all. Back then, Chu Feng was nothing more than a junior in the eyes of the major powers of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>She would have never imagined that their positions would be reversed in such a manner within such a short period of time.<br>There was also a period of time where she had harbored feelings for Chu Feng, but in the face of the massive disparity between them, she could only bury those feelings deep in her heart.<br>She didn&rsquo;t even have the courage to voice her feelings out aloud.<br>While she, as the Holy Daughter of the Starfall Holy Land, was a celebrated figure within the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, she was painfully aware that she was no longer worthy of matching Chu Feng anymore, be it in terms of their strength or standing.<br></p></div>
