        <div>: Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s Ambitions<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Speaking of which, young master Kongping, how did you get captured by Chu Feng?&rdquo; Lord Taibai asked.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean, how did I get captured? He captured me in Lush Immortal City,&rdquo; Jiang Kongping replied.<br>Lord Taibai frowned upon hearing those words, but he didn&rsquo;t harp on the issue. Instead, he changed the topic and said, &ldquo;Young master Kongping, you can&rsquo;t play around anymore after you recover from your injuries. You&rsquo;ll have to go into closed-door training and focus on your cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why should I? It&rsquo;s not as if you don&rsquo;t know that I hate cultivating,&rdquo; Jiang Kongping protested in displeasure.<br>&ldquo;I just received news that young master Yuantai is on his way here. Do you still remember young master Yuantai telling you that he&rsquo;ll teach you a lesson if your spirit power hasn&rsquo;t reached rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation by the time he arrives?&rdquo; Lord Taibai said.<br>&ldquo;Are you for real? Aren&rsquo;t my older brother and my father busy dealing with that matter in the Seven Realms Galaxy? Why is he coming here all of a sudden?&rdquo;<br>Jiang Kongping immediately sat upright out of nervousness. From his expression, it was apparent that he was fearful of his older brother.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t dare to lie to you. Here, have a look at it yourself.&rdquo;<br>Lord Taibai took out a spirit power letter and passed it to Jiang Kongping.<br>&ldquo;Holy shit! He&rsquo;s really coming here!&rdquo;<br>Jiang Kongping shuddered out of fright upon seeing the letter. He quickly laid back down and shouted at those around him, &ldquo;Hurry up and dispel this darned formation from me! I&rsquo;m going into closed-door training!!!&rdquo;<br>This was the first time Jiang Kongping was urging them to dispel the formation on him throughout the entire conversation. It showed just how desperate he was.<br>Those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect dared not to dawdle and quickly helped him undo the formation.<br>&ldquo;The formation constructed by Chu Feng is really hard to undo. It looks like there are prodigies in the Eastern Region too.&rdquo;<br>Lord Taibai&rsquo;s eyes narrowed upon seeing the crowd&rsquo;s anxious looks too. He could tell that the formation was a tough nut to crack.<br>The key difficulty was that any missteps could potentially threaten Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s life, so they had to proceed carefully. Nevertheless, it was rare to see a junior being able to construct such a troublesome formation.<br>Just then, ten figures suddenly entered the palace and fell to their knees. They were members of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect too.<br>&ldquo;Lord Taibai, we were inept. We failed to intercept the teleportation formation Chu Feng used when escaping from the area.&rdquo;<br>It turned out that Lord Taibai had dispatched these ten people to corner Chu Feng. There was no way they would let Chu Feng off the hook when he had dared to lay his hands on Jiang Kongping.<br>However, it was clear that they had failed.<br>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t even intercept a teleportation formation constructed by a junior? Useless!&rdquo; Lord Taibai berated.<br>Despite this, he didn&rsquo;t pursue the matter. He knew that it was not that these ten people were truly useless but that he had underestimated Chu Feng. The soul-linking formation on Jiang Kongping was the best evidence of that.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a chance to make up for your failure. Investigate this matter.&rdquo;<br>Lord Taibai passed a letter to those ten people.<br>When they took a look at the letter, their faces immediately paled. They finally understood why Lord Taibai didn&rsquo;t directly instruct them to do anything but instead passed them a spirit power letter.<br>The content of the letter was:<br>There must have been a spy who gave away young master Kongping&rsquo;s whereabouts. Root out that person!<br>Sima Xiangtu was unaware of the conversation that had transpired amongst those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. He had obediently left the palace for the Nine Souls Sacred Clan to settle the matter.<br>That being said, all he had to do was to force them into submission. There was nothing more effective than that.<br>After dealing with the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, he returned to his own quarters. He crossed his legs and sat down, intending to cultivate, but something caught his attention.<br>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;<br>Sima Xiangtu first touched his own eyes to seal off the confinement formation imprisoning the Ox-nosed Old Daoist before forming a series of hand seals and pointing it in front of him.<br>Weng!<br>A spirit formation gate surfaced.<br>Moments later, a person walked through the spirit formation gate. It was the black-robed man whom Chu Feng had met at Lush Immortal City!<br>It was just that he was in a terrible state, and black aura was continuously puffing out of his body.<br>&ldquo;Master, I was useless!&rdquo;<br>The black-robed man immediately kneeled down in front of Sima Xiangtu. It turned out that he was Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s disciple.<br>&ldquo;How did you suffer such severe injuries? I left a formation on you. Even if you aren&rsquo;t a match for Chu Feng, you shouldn&rsquo;t have lost so badly.&rdquo;<br>Sima Xiangtu hurriedly walked over and supported the black-robed man up. He constructed a recovery formation and began treating him. It was just that there was something peculiar about the recovery formation he was using.<br>A hint of worry appeared on Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s face as he treated the black-robed man.<br>&ldquo;Master, Chu Feng possesses extremely powerful means. His martial skill allows him to rival enemies two cultivation ranks stronger than him. I wasn&rsquo;t a match for him. If not for the defensive formation you left on me, I&rsquo;d have lost my life,&rdquo; the black-robed man said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve underestimated Chu Feng. Jiang Kongping is safe right now, so you don&rsquo;t need to worry too much about it. It&rsquo;s just that you aren&rsquo;t in a condition to stay here for too long. You should return first and recuperate from your injuries,&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu said.<br>&ldquo;Master, I am already about to acclimatize myself. I shouldn&rsquo;t be long before I can accomplish what you have asked of me,&rdquo; the black-robed man said confidently.<br>&ldquo;I have other arrangements. You need not worry about that,&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu said.<br>The black-robed man panicked upon hearing those words. He quickly added, &ldquo;Master, please give me some time. I won&rsquo;t let you down a second time. I beg you not to abandon me!&rdquo;<br>It was an intense reaction that fully displayed his fear.<br>Sima Xiangtu chuckled softly before patting the black-robed man&rsquo;s shoulder, saying, &ldquo;My silly disciple. That matter isn&rsquo;t as important as your safety is to me. Besides, I have found another solution to resolve that matter. You just have to focus on your recuperation for the time being. I&rsquo;ll return you your freedom soon enough.<br>&ldquo;By then, I&rsquo;ll take you out of that damned place, and we&rsquo;ll leave our mark in the vast world of cultivation. By then, be it the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, or the Totem Dragon Clan, they will all be trampled beneath our feet!&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu said.<br>&ldquo;Master, I&rsquo;m grateful for your favor. I swear that I&rsquo;ll never let you down again,&rdquo; the black-robed man said.<br>&ldquo;Go back. The Pill Dao Immortal Sect has eyes on me, so you can&rsquo;t stay here for too long,&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu said.<br>&ldquo;Master, I&rsquo;ll be taking my leave now.&rdquo;<br>The black-robed man bowed deeply before returning into the spirit formation gate. Shortly after he left, Sima Xiangtu quickly formed a series of hand seals and closed the spirit formation gate.<br>Even though the spirit formation gate had closed, Sima Xiangtu continued to look at the spirit formation gate with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Zhuge Yuankong, your disciple might be powerful, but he&rsquo;s nothing compared to me. You have lost to me, and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before my disciple tramples your disciple as well!&rdquo;<br>Those words were directed toward himself, for he knew that Zhuge Yuanking could no longer hear those words.<br></p></div>
