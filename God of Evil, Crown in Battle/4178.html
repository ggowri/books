        <div> - The Look From A Love Rival<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Princess, since I&rsquo;ve agreed to it, it means that I&rsquo;m prepared,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with great certainty.<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re prepared, let&rsquo;s set off right away,&rdquo; said Long Xiaoxiao.<br>Hearing that, Chu Feng looked to Fumo Xin&rsquo;er, who stood beside him.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xin&rsquo;er, perhaps you should stay with Senior Long&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know them. It&rsquo;s better that I accompany you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can have that Senior Long and others inform my big brother of my whereabouts.&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er knew what Chu Feng wanted to say. Thus, she interrupted him with a refusal. Her attitude was extremely clear -- she intended to follow Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Okay then,&rdquo; Chu Feng knew that he wouldn't be able to persuade her. Thus, he didn&rsquo;t bother saying anymore.<br>If he were to truly encounter dangers, he would just refuse to have Fumo Xin&rsquo;er follow him then.<br>&ldquo;Girl, are you really planning to follow us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should know that this matter is very dangerous, and could be fatal,&rdquo; said Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Little girl, when you&rsquo;re not afraid, how could your big sister be afraid?&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait and see then. Best make sure to not piss yourself in fear.&rdquo;<br>As Long Xiaoxiao spoke, she extended her hand. She was trying to pinch Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s cheek again.<br>However, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was prepared for it, and actually dodged her.<br>Of course, Chu Feng could tell that Long Xiaoxiao wasn&rsquo;t serious. Else, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er wouldn&rsquo;t be able to dodge her.<br>Although he wasn&rsquo;t certain what Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s cultivation was, Chu Feng felt that even the current him wouldn't be a match for her.<br>That girl was extremely strong.<br>Once they made their decision, the four of them immediately set off.<br>Apart from Chu Feng, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er and Long Xiaoxiao, Long Shengbu naturally also travelled with them.<br>Chu Feng discovered that even though Long Shengbu was the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder, he acted more like Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s personal guard.<br>That was understandable. After all, major powers would always protect their top geniuses.<br>What surprised Chu Feng was the fact that the place they ended up in just so happened to be in the Upper Realm they were in.<br>Furthermore, it was not very far from the Endless Abyss either. Thus, the journey was not long or difficult at all.<br>The four of them arrived at their destination in a short four hours.<br>The place they arrived at was a vast ocean. However, after they passed through a spirit formation, everything changed.<br>What appeared before them was a vast and boundless amount of palaces.<br>Those palaces were not only very majestic in appearance, they were also guarded by many people from the Dragon Clan.<br>Chu Feng knew that this should be a Dragon Clan base of operations.<br>That was understandable. After all, they had discovered the Endless Abyss, a place that contained cultivation treasures for the Dragon Clan.<br>Since the Dragon Clan had discovered it, it was normal for them to establish a base of operations and station people there to observe the Endless Abyss.<br>However, after entering, Chu Feng discovered that the place was not as simple as he had imagined it to be.<br>Whilst the palaces outside appeared normal, the ones inside seemed to be rather old, very old.<br>Furthermore, the further they went, the stronger the Dragon Clansmen guards became. They were far stronger than those outside.<br>From their strict postures and the scope of the group of palaces, Chu Feng started to think that had it not been for the fact that it was in the Heaven-devouring Starfield, he might end up thinking it was the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s headquarters.<br>Chu Feng and the others arrived at a garden.<br>The garden was enormous. There were mountains, forests and rivers everywhere. In fact, they even passed by two seas.<br>The garden seemed to be boundless. As they proceeded onward, Chu Feng was no longer able to see the palaces they had passed earlier.<br>This was no garden at all. It was simply an isolated world.<br>Finally, Long Xiaoxiao stopped over a distinctive forest.<br>The reason why this forest was distinctive was because the plants, rocks and running water in the forest were all golden.<br>The forest was also emitting a special aura.<br>To the people from the Dragon Clan, the forest was a place that could aid them in cultivation.<br>&ldquo;Long Nanxun, it&rsquo;s time for you to show yourself.&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao did not descend to the ground. Rather, she shouted towards the boundless forest.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;<br>Once Long Xiaoxiao called, a figure rapidly flew out from the distant forest.<br>It was a young man..<br>That young man had a very handsome appearance and he wore the outfit of the Dragon Clan. However, his outfit was somewhat peculiar.<br>It was even more exquisite.<br>When the man appeared, he had a smile on his face.<br>It could be seen that he was very happy.<br>His eyes were fixed on Long Xiaoxiao.<br>However, when he noticed Chu Feng, a look of displeasure flashed through his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;<br>Upon approaching Long Xiaoxiao, the young man directly asked her who Chu Feng was.<br>He had completely ignored Fumo Xin&rsquo;er, and only attacked Chu Feng.<br>His gaze was filled with hostility.<br>Chu Feng had seen many such gazes before.<br>It was the gaze of someone who saw a rival in love.<br>Evidently, that man by the name of Long Nanxun had a different kind of feeling for Long Xiaoxiao.<br>But, there was no special relationship between Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao.<br>For him to determine Chu Feng to be his love rival just like that, it was simply too outrageous.<br>&ldquo;Long Nanxun, let me introduce you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This person here is Chu Feng. He&rsquo;s a genius world spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, girl, allow me to make introductions for the two of you too. This person here is Long Nanxun,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao introduced the two parties.<br>&ldquo;Genius world spiritist?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met many genius world spiritists. I also know quite a few of them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even the genius disciple of the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s strongest world spiritist, Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted&rsquo;s Lu Jie, is my friend.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How come I&rsquo;ve never heard of this genius world spiritist here?&rdquo;<br>Long Nanxun swept his gaze towards Chu Feng. Not only were his eyes filled with ill-intent, they were also filled with contempt.<br>His tone was also extremely mocking.<br>&ldquo;Long Nanxun, Chu Feng is my guest. Can you stop looking for trouble?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is a capable fellow. If he wasn&rsquo;t, I wouldn&rsquo;t have invited him here,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao spoke with a slight amount of displeasure.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, may I know what rank of the Dragon Transformation Sensation this genius world spiritist you spoke of has comprehended?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, another voice sounded.<br>Following that voice, an old lady flew out from the golden forest in the distance. She then landed before Chu Feng and the others.<br>After the old lady landed, she only smiled to greet Long Shengbu, an act that Long Shengbu responded to in kind. She did not greet anyone else.<br>From the aura she emitted, the way she was dressed and the air she gave off, Chu Feng knew that she was extraordinary.<br>For the old lady to be able to stand on equal footing as Long Shengbu, Chu Feng felt that she was very possibly an existence on par with him.<br>Else, she wouldn&rsquo;t possibly not show her respects to Long Shengbu and Long Xiaoxiao.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng knew that she must be very powerful.<br>&ldquo;Grandma Ruiyun, I&rsquo;m not joking around. Chu Feng is indeed very powerful,&rdquo; said Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, this old lady does not bear any malice. I merely don't wish for you to be deceived by others.&rdquo;<br>The old lady smiled at Long Xiaoxiao. Then, she turned her gaze to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, may I know what rank Dragon Transformation Sensation you are?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Or perhaps you&rsquo;re a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>That old lady&rsquo;s gaze was very aggressive. She was deeply looking down on Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Grandma Ruiyun, what&rsquo;s with those questions?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Look at his age. How could he be a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Likely, Xiaoxiao was deceived by this kid.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Someone like him should be severely punished.&rdquo;<br>Feeling hostile towards Chu Feng, that Long Nanxun not only mocked Chu Feng, but he even wanted to take care of him.<br>&ldquo;Rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I believe you?&rdquo;<br>Long Nanxun had a look of disbelief after hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s response.<br>&ldquo;Long Nanxun, what are you implying here? Are you doubting my vision?&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao became increasingly displeased with Long Nanxun.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, that&rsquo;s not my intention at all. I&rsquo;m merely afraid that you&rsquo;ve been deceived,&rdquo; said Long Nanxun.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, you should tell him to leave.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already requested two world spiritists at rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, I&rsquo;ve also invited the All-seeing Heavenly Master. They&rsquo;re on their way here, and will be here soon.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, a world spiritist with a mere rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation would not be able to provide any help,&rdquo; said the old lady.<br>&ldquo;Even the All-seeing Heavenly Master was invited over? Elder Ruiyun, you have quite the face to move someone like that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You must know that there are people lined up to pay high prices to request the All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s assistance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Reportedly, apart from the master of the All-seeing Heavenly Master, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, no one is able to move her.&rdquo;<br>Even Long Shengbu was pleasantly surprised when he heard that even the All-seeing Heavenly Master had been invited over. Unable to contain himself, he began to praise the old lady.<br></p></div>
