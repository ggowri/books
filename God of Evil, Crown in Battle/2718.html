        <div> - Large Disparity Of Strength<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Chu Xianshuo did not immediately unleash his spirit formation to attack Chu Feng after he finished setting it up. He seemed to be deliberately showing off the might of his spirit formation.<br>An expression of pride and complacence filled his face. It was as if the outcome of the battle was already determined, that he was destined to win.<br>However, when he turned his proud gaze toward Chu Feng, he was startled, and an expression of confusion emerged in his eyes.<br>He was shocked to discover that Chu Feng actually did not have the slightest bit of fear in his eyes.<br>On the contrary, Chu Feng had a smile on his face.<br>Chu Feng was actually smiling. Not only was he smiling, but his smile was also very mocking.<br>Chu Feng was actually mocking him?<br>&ldquo;What are you smiling about?!&rdquo; Chu Xianshuo asked furiously.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m smiling at the fact that you&rsquo;ve only managed to set up such a formation after spending an entire quarter hour. You are truly useless,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who gave you the courage to dare say those sort of words?!&rdquo; Chu Xianshuo was so furious that his eyes turned red. It was as if he were planning to eat someone alive.<br>In fact, it was not only Chu Xianshuo that was furious. The people inside the hunting ground and the people watching from outside the hunting ground were also astonished by what Chu Feng said.<br>They were astonished at the fact that Chu Feng could actually say that sort of thing at a time like this.<br>There was an enormous disparity between their spirit formations. Even the experts outside were able to tell that Chu Xianshuo possessed absolute superiority over Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng is also an arrogant and conceited individual. I have judged him wrongly,&rdquo; The fiery red-haired old man sighed and shook his head disappointedly.<br>Originally, he had thought very highly of Chu Feng after seeing how he dared to go against the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>However, after seeing how arrogant Chu Feng was, he was slightly displeased.<br>That being said, when compared to the fiery red-haired old man and the others outside, the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master was very calm.<br>Furthermore, he had a faint smile on his face the entire time.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng did not reply, the furious Chu Xianshuo asked again. &ldquo;Chu Feng, I am asking you who gave you the courage to say that sort of thing to me?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What makes you think that your lousy spirit formation is capable of contending against my Divine Dragonspear Formation?!&rdquo;<br>He knew very well that what happened here was something that was not only visible to the people inside the hunting ground, but the people outside the hunting ground were also capable of seeing it.<br>Thus, he wished Chu Feng to be utterly defeated. He wanted Chu Feng to suffer a miserable defeat.<br>&ldquo;What I say is of no importance. What&rsquo;s important is what the truth will be,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You want to have facts speak for you? Very well, I will satisfy you!&rdquo; Chu Xianshuo shouted.<br>Then, his long spear turned into a golden light that shot straight toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Not only was the moving spear overwhelmingly powerful, but it also let out a dragon&rsquo;s roar.<br>It was as if the spear were truly formed by a Divine Dragon.<br>At the moment when that spear was sent forth, practically everyone felt that Chu Feng was done for.<br>No one felt that Chu Feng&rsquo;s defensive formation would be capable of blocking Chu Xianshuo&rsquo;s Divine Dragonspear Formation.<br>The next moment, the spear collided with Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation was actually completely undamaged. It merely trembled slightly.<br>&ldquo;It actually&hellip; blocked it?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was completely dumbfounded. Even that fiery red-haired old man was no exception.<br>Only the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master had an unchanged expression. It was as if all of this was within his expectations.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, that spear of yours is truly weak,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Humph, don&rsquo;t you think that you&rsquo;ve won with just this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will have you witness the true strength of my spirit formation now!&rdquo;<br>As Chu Xianshuo spoke, he changed the hand seals that he was making. The next moment, the spear that was blocked by Chu Feng&rsquo;s defensive formation started to spin.<br>At that moment, fierce light and ear-piercing rumbles began to radiate all around. Even Chu Feng&rsquo;s defensive formation started to tremble nonstop.<br>The earth where the two were fighting started to quake violently. Even the cultivators nearby started to sway back and forth, unable to stand firm.<br>At that moment, the people outside the hunting ground all began to praise Chu Xianshuo in their hearts. They were praising him for how brilliant he was.<br>The reason for that was because, rather than calling Chu Xianshuo&rsquo;s spirit formation a slaughtering formation, it would be more accurate to call it a formation breaching formation.<br>That spirit formation of his specialized in breaching defensive formations.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Finally, Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation let out a violent rumble. The spear had managed to drill through Chu Feng&rsquo;s defensive formation.<br>Although it had managed to drill a portion of itself through Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation, the spear did not manage to pierce into Chu Feng.<br>The speed at which it was progressing was very slow. It was still being obstructed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation. Only a fifth of it managed to drill past Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng&rsquo;s ability in terms of world spirit techniques is most definitely superior to Chu Xianshuo&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, he is too conceited. Because of that, he will be defeated. He only has himself to blame.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd all felt that Chu Feng would undoubtedly be defeated.<br>There were people among the group gathered outside the hunting ground that started to feel pity for Chu Feng. However, there were also people that felt that Chu Feng was getting what he deserved for being so conceited.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, the outcome of the battle has been determined. You do not have to put up any needless resistance anymore. You&rsquo;ve already lost,&rdquo; Chu Xianshuo declared.<br>At that moment, complacency filled Chu Xianshuo&rsquo;s face. He felt that since he had managed to drill through Chu Feng&rsquo;s defensive formation, he would definitely be able to shatter it completely soon.<br>The resistance that Chu Feng was putting up right now was simply useless. The outcome had already been determined. He, Chu Xianshuo, had won.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, the outcome has been determined. However, it&rsquo;s evident that the loser is not me, but you,&rdquo; Chu Feng spread his hands.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; how could that Chu Feng say that sort of thing? Has he gone mad?&rdquo;<br>Before Chu Xianshuo could say anything, the others were already completely puzzled.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s defensive formation had already been breached. Yet, he still dared to say that sort of thing? Apart from being mad, the crowd was unable to think of any other possibility for his action.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, never would I have thought that you would be this shameless, that you would even deceive yourself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You have clearly already lost. Yet you&rsquo;re still trying to resist and declare that you&rsquo;re the victor?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Since you are unable to be convinced until you&rsquo;re faced with the grim reality, I, Chu Xianshuo, will let you know your place!&rdquo;<br>As Chu Xianshuo spoke, the hand seals he was making changed once again. He was strengthening his spirit formation so that it could pierce through Chu Feng&rsquo;s defensive formation and kill him.<br>&ldquo;Break!!!&rdquo;<br>Chu Xianshuo shouted loudly. He pushed forth his hands. The hand seals on his hands were emitting brilliant light.<br>At the same time, the spear grew much brighter. However, the spear that was drilling through the entire time suddenly stopped moving.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; what is going on?&rdquo;<br>The crowd inside and outside the hunting ground were all startled upon seeing this scene.<br>No, there were exceptions. They were two individuals. One was Chu Feng, and the other was the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master.<br>&ldquo;Break!!!&rdquo;<br>Chu Xianshuo refused to believe what was happening, and shouted loudly again. However, there was still no movement from his spear.<br>Chu Xianshuo was dumbfounded. He was completely bewildered. It was as if he were unable to control his spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Truly a fool,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>&ldquo;What did you say?!&rdquo; Chu Xianshuo asked furiously.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling you a fool. Even now, you still do not know your current situation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you are unable to understand what happened, I will explain to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This spirit formation of mine was never drilled through by your spear,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you refuse to admit what happened! My spear has already drilled through your spirit formation, yet you dare argue with reality?!&rdquo; Chu Xianshuo said.<br>&ldquo;It was I who controlled my defensive formation, and voluntarily allowed your spear to enter it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is not your spear that managed to drill through my defensive formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br><br></p></div>
