        <div> - Fierce Divine Tribulation Lightning<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><br>Chu Feng did not continue to argue with Her Lady Queen. Instead, he helped Song Xi up and inspected his current state.<br><br>Upon inspecting Song Xi, Chu Feng started to frown.<br><br>&ldquo;Milord, is Xi-boy alright? Could he be in fatal danger?&rdquo; Song Xi&rsquo;s mother asked worriedly.<br><br>&ldquo;The power of the inheritance is too strong. Song Xi will need time to fuse with it. While I can help him, the process of fusion will still be very painful. Whether or not he will be able to live will be up to him.&rdquo;<br><br>As Chu Feng spoke, he started to set up a spirit formation to help Song Xi fuse with the inheritance he had received.<br><br>Song Xi remained unconscious the entire time. However, he would let out screams of pain from time to time. That said, there was nothing Chu Feng could do about it.<br><br>It was as Chu Feng said, his spirit formation could only provide help for Song Xi. As for whether or not Song Xi would be able to fuse with the inheritance would be dependent on Song Xi himself.<br><br>At the moment when Chu Feng started to idle, Her Lady Queen asked excitedly, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you also entered that formation earlier. Did you manage to receive the inheritance too?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I have indeed received the inheritance. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s quite a major harvest too,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;What sort of inheritance is it? Tell me, quickly tell this Queen,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked impatiently.<br><br>&ldquo;When I entered, it should have been the final phase of the inheritance process. Thus, I did not obtain that so-called Ten Thousand Poisons Mysterious Technique, nor was I directly imbued with cultivation. However, I&rsquo;ve received three Immortal Techniques,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;What sort of Immortal Techniques? Quickly, tell me about them,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen urged.<br><br>&ldquo;Rank one Immortal Technique, Aura Poison Flow.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Rank two Immortal Technique, Monstrous Poison Flow.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Rank three Immortal Technique, Dragon Poison Flow,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;Woah! That&rsquo;s pretty good. When would you be able to learn them? How are those Immortal Techniques? Are they powerful? Judging from their names, could they be related to that Ten Thousand Poisons Demon Sect?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br><br>&ldquo;Indeed, they are related to the Ten Thousand Poisons Demon Sect. Those three Immortal Techniques are a set of sequential Immortal Techniques.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Once one completely masters the three Immortal Techniques, one would be able to comprehend a new Immortal Technique.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;As for that new Immortal Technique, it is still a rank three Immortal Technique. However, its power is greatly superior to other rank three Immortal Techniques. It is an ability that is approaching the power of a rank four Immortal Technique.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;As for that Immortal Technique, it&rsquo;s called the Ten Thousand Poisons Descent,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;Not bad, not bad. Your harvest was truly decent,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen spoke excitedly.<br><br>However, soon, Her Lady Queen revealed a slightly disappointed expression. She sighed and said, &ldquo;If we had known the inheritance to be this powerful, you should&rsquo;ve directly entered it. Even if you are to give this inheritance to that Song Xi, he will not be able to endure it. As such, it would be better off if you had received it.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Haha, Milady Queen, this is something that does not belong to us to begin with. To be able to obtain those Immortal Techniques as part of the inheritance is already pretty good,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;The issue is that Song Xi is unable to withstand it. Not only that, but he might even die because of it. This is truly a waste,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br><br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it like that. Although I did not obtain the forced instillment of cultivation, but perhaps because of the fact that that grand inheritance formation contained profoundness toward martial cultivation, I managed to make some comprehensions,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;What did you manage to comprehend? Quickly, tell this Queen about it,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked with her large eyes blinking brightly.<br><br>&ldquo;I managed to obtain martial comprehension. Furthermore, it was a great harvest. I feel like I can attempt to breakthrough to rank three True Immortal,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;Really? That&rsquo;s truly great then. Not bad, not bad. That spirit formation is truly not bad. Seems like we have not journeyed here in vain.&rdquo;<br><br>Her Lady Queen became excited. Her Lady Queen was always like this, she always placed Chu Feng&rsquo;s interest first, and did not care about the lives and deaths of others.<br><br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Chu Feng, go open and check out that Cosmos Sack. There must be a lot of treasures inside,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br><br>&ldquo;That belongs to Song Xi. How could I tamper with it?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;So what? You&rsquo;re merely checking it out. I&rsquo;m not telling you to take it. At the very most, you&rsquo;ll be borrowing it. You&rsquo;ll return it to him afterwards. After all, with how weak his cultivation is right now, it&rsquo;s useless to him,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br><br>&ldquo;Please spare me. Milady Queen, it is truly impossible for me to do something like that,&rdquo; Chu Feng refused determinedly.<br><br>Actually, if he were truly only checking things out, it would be fine.<br><br>Furthermore, Chu Feng was also curious as to what was inside the Cosmos Sack.<br><br>However, if there truly were treasures inside the Cosmos Sack, Her Lady Queen would definitely tell him to use them first and return them to Song Xi later.<br><br>With Chu Feng&rsquo;s character, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do that sort of thing. Thus, he decided that it would be better that he not look at the contents of the Cosmos Sack so that Her Lady Queen wouldn&lsquo;t nag him about it afterwards.<br><br>After that, Chu Feng surveyed Song Xi and discovered that he would not be able to wake up in the short term.<br><br>Thus, he decided to attempt to learn that rank one Immortal Technique, Aura Poison Flow.<br><br>However, upon doing so, Chu Feng discovered that there was truly a restriction that one must satisfy in order to learn Immortal Techniques. At the very least, with his cultivation of rank two True Immortal, he would not be able to learn it.<br><br>Thus, Chu Feng activated his Lightning Mark and increased his cultivation to rank three True Immortal. However, he was still unable to learn the Immortal Technique.<br><br>In the end, Chu Feng determined that his actual cultivation must reach the requirement in order to learn an Immortal Technique. Otherwise, it would simply be impossible.<br><br>Seeing that he was unable to learn the Immortal Technique, Chu Feng took out that Immortal Armament, the Darkstone Dagger.<br><br>That was an Immortal Armament. Its power was most definitely not something an Incomplete Immortal Armament could compare with.<br><br>Even though the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master had called Chu Feng&rsquo;s attention to the fact that one must reach a cultivation of Martial Immortal in order to handle the power of an Immortal Armament and told him to not attempt to subdue the Darkstone Dagger or else he might end up receiving its backlash, Chu Feng was simply too curious, and wanted to give it a try.<br><br>In the end, Chu Feng attempted to subdue the Darkstone Dagger and failed. However, fortunately, Chu Feng did not receive its backlash.<br><br>Seeing that he was unable to learn the Immortal Techniques and unable to subdue the Immortal Armament, Chu Feng could only do one thing -- attempt a breakthrough.<br><br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s harvest this time around was truly enormous. If his breakthrough in the hunting ground was an attempt without actual certainty of success, then Chu Feng&rsquo;s target this time would not be an attempt, but an actual breakthrough.<br><br>Chu Feng possessed a hundred percent certainty that he would be able to successfully reach a breakthrough. The reason for that the martial comprehension he had obtained in the inheritance process was an extraordinary amount. It allowed Chu Feng to have a whole new understanding toward the path of martial cultivation.<br><br>It fact, it could be said to be a whole new breakthrough in the nature of martial cultivation.<br><br>Chu Feng felt that with his current comprehension, not to mention a breakthrough to rank three True Immortal, even attempting to breakthrough to rank four True Immortal would be possible.<br><br>Once Chu Feng made the decision, he immediately acted upon it. He immediately started to break through.<br><br>This time around, it was as Chu Feng had anticipated.<br><br>He successfully gave rise to the Divine Tribulation&rsquo;s lightning. Merely, when the lightning struck, Chu Feng received an unprecedented pain.<br><br>Even though Chu Feng was inside an underground palace hall, he was still completely covered by the Divine Tribulation&rsquo;s lightning. That lightning seemed to want to kill Chu Feng and destroy his soul.<br><br>Not only was Chu Feng gnashing his teeth and sweating profusely, but he would also let out painful screams from time to time. The longer it continued, the more frequent Chu Feng&rsquo;s screams became.<br><br>In the end, Chu Feng actually fell to the ground and started to roll back and forth.<br><br>Seeing this, Song Xi&rsquo;s mother grew extremely worried.<br><br>Even though Chu Feng had mentioned what he was doing to her beforehand and told her that it would be because of his breakthrough and nothing else, Song Xi&rsquo;s mother was still extremely worried upon seeing how Chu Feng was reacting.<br><br>When even Song Xi&rsquo;s mother became so worried about Chu Feng, Her Lady Queen would naturally be worried mad.<br><br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you alright? Persist through it, you must definitely persist through it.&rdquo;<br><br>Her Lady Queen started to panic. She was worried that Chu Feng would not be able to persist. If that were to happen, the only thing that would await Chu Feng would be death.<br><br>After all, that was no ordinary Self-Punishing Mysterious Technique. Instead, it was the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br><br><br></p></div>
