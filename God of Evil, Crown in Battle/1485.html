        <div> - Asking For Trouble<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>The various headmasters had been waiting at the exit of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Remnants the entire time. They all wished to see with their own eyes exactly which disciple would be capable of obtaining the banner.<br>Finally, Chu Feng and the others walked out with grandiose strides. When the various headmasters and elders saw the banner in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand, even though they had already slightly anticipated this, they were all still very astonished.<br>After all, the matter of Chu Feng defeating the twenty disciples of the Cursed Soil Sect were only things that they had heard and not seen with their own eyes. When they hadn&rsquo;t seen it for themselves, they would naturally be skeptical of it.<br>Yet, at this moment, Chu Feng returned with the banner in his hand and the disciples of the various other powers following behind him, thus this reality was placed right before their eyes.<br>Most importantly, as Chu Feng led the disciples, he gave off a very abundant and imposing air of a ruler. It was as if he were the king among all the disciples, and no one was equal to him, no one could match up to him.<br>As for the disciples from the other powers, they actually accepted their situation. Regardless of what sort of expression the disciples might have on their faces, the experienced headmasters and elders were able to see a common ground in their expressions: surrender. They had all chosen to yield to Chu Feng. Not a single one among them dared to go against him.<br>In fact, even the Ten Thousand Flowers Garden&rsquo;s Nie sisters had this sort of expression on their faces.<br>What did this mean? This meant that Chu Feng had obtained the number one position in this Nine Powers Hunt using his strength. Furthermore, it should be absolute power. Else, it would be impossible for this group of disciples to all have expressions of surrender on their faces.<br>After all, these disciples were the most arrogant, most prideful and most conceited existences in the Nine Powers. If they hadn't encountered someone who had completely won them over, they would not be displaying this sort of expression.<br>&ldquo;Congratulations Brother Dugu. A genius has descended upon your Cyanwood Mountain from the heavens. Truly, it is worthy of celebration.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This little friend Chu Feng is truly a dark horse. Never would I have imagined that even the Nie sisters would be defeated by him. No wonder Brother Dugu is this confident in him. I truly never would&rsquo;ve thought that little friend Chu Feng was this strong.&rdquo;<br>In an instant, the various elders began to praise Chu Feng nonstop before Dugu Xingfeng.<br>The reason they were doing this was actually because they wanted to curry favor with Chu Feng. Although Chu Feng might be small and weak right now, he was a great genius, a dragon among men.<br>The headmasters were all experienced and astute individuals. They were all able to see the unlimited potential in Chu Feng.<br>Although Chu Feng was only a little Martial King right now, in several tens of years, several hundreds of years or several thousands of years, his cultivation would definitely not be only that of a Martial King. Even surpassing them and becoming a Martial Emperor was not an impossibility.<br>Although their actions might appear to be somewhat unbefitting of their status, they were actually thinking about the long-term and trying to obtain a good relationship with a future Martial Emperor.<br>Although they only felt that Chu Feng might be able to become a Martial Emperor in the future, they did not wish to miss out on that possibility.<br>The praises from the various headmasters and elders did not cause a great change to Dugu Xingfeng&rsquo;s expression. However, he was, nevertheless, smiling fully. Beside him, Half Martial Emperor White Ape was also smiling.<br>They felt that they had not misjudged Chu Feng, and that they had not wasted the appreciation and attention that they had given him. Finally, they had managed to obtain what they wanted. In fact, their harvest was even greater than they had thought it would be.<br>That was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s growth and performance had surpassed both their expectations. This disciple had truly given them a lot of face and become the future hope of the Cyanwood Mountain.<br>However, compared to Half Martial Emperor White Ape, Crazed Killer Tuoba had a very ugly expression on his face. That was because, of the many people present, he might be the one who did not wish to see this development the most.<br>&ldquo;Lord Headmaster, Chu Feng killed senior brother Qin,&rdquo; Suddenly, Bai Yunxiao, Tao Xiangyu and the other Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s disciples rushed forward. &ldquo;Putt,&rdquo; they all knelt before Dugu Xingfeng and started to cry and wail with snot all over their faces.<br>&ldquo;What did you say? Chu Feng killed who?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the one that was most shocked was Crazed Killer Tuoba.<br>&ldquo;Lord Punishment Elder, Chu Feng killed senior brother Qin, Qin Lingyun,&rdquo; Bai Yunxiao knew that Crazed Killer Tuoba valued Qin Lingyun deeply. Thus, he spoke very loudly and with a great amount of grievance. He was deliberately trying to make Crazed Killer Tuoba stand up for them and take care of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng killed Lingyun?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Crazed Killer Tuoba stepped back three steps in succession. His complexion turned pale as paper. It was as if he had received an enormous shock.<br>At this moment, Half Martial Emperor White Ape and the Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s other elders, as well as the elders from the other powers, started to frown deeply.<br>After all, killing a fellow disciple was a capital offense. Furthermore, Qin Lingyun was a genius. If this matter happened in any sect or school, it would be something that they would not tolerate.<br>However, compared to the elders, Dugu Xingfeng had a blank face. In fact, the other headmasters did not have much of a reaction from this either.<br>&ldquo;Lord Headmaster, this Chu Feng&rsquo;s behavior is truly unscrupulous. Not only did he kill senior brother Qin, he even forced us to kneel to him and beg for forgiveness. He had no regard for laws and morality!&rdquo; Bai Yunxiao and the others began to add details to their story.<br>Suddenly, Crazed Killer Tuoba shouted in anger, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you are truly daring. You killed a fellow disciple, your crime shall be punished with death. Men! Arrest this Chu Feng!&rdquo; The anger that he was feeling was completely present on his face. If it weren&rsquo;t for the fact that there were too many people present, he would definitely have smashed Chu Feng to death on the spot.<br>After hearing those words, the various management elders of the Punishment Department immediately leapt forth and arrived before Chu Feng. They wanted to arrest him.<br>Suddenly, Dugu Xingfeng shouted, &ldquo;Stay your hands!&rdquo;  His snarl was louder than thunder. Not only did the world tremble upon his words, even those elders who wanted to arrest Chu Feng were jolted and sent flying.<br>Dugu Xingfeng was not going to allow them to touch Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Lord Headmaster, killing a fellow disciple is a capital offense. This is something that our founder established. You most definitely cannot allow him to get away with this,&rdquo; Seeing that Dugu Xingfeng was deliberately shielding Chu Feng, Crazed Killer Tuoba immediately kneeled onto the ground and even brought up the Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s founder.<br>&ldquo;Rules are dead but people are alive; am I the headmaster or are you the headmaster? Since when did I have to have you teach me how to act?&rdquo; Dugu Xingfeng&rsquo;s gaze was ice-cold as he said those words with a very cold tone.<br>&ldquo;This subordinate does not dare, this subordinate does not dare,&rdquo; Crazed Killer Tuoba was frightened by Dugu Xingfeng&rsquo;s gaze. He was able to sense Dugu Xingfeng&rsquo;s anger and did not dare to say anymore.<br>&ldquo;What Headmaster Dugu says is correct. Although all the powers have the rule that killing fellow disciples is a capital offense, one must not forget why this rule was established. When all's said and done, the reason why this rule was established was so the interests of the sect or school are ensured. After all, the death of a disciple is a loss to the sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Therefore, what Headmaster Dugu says is very correct. While rules are dead, people are alive. The rules are there in order to secure the interests of the sect. However, if the existence of the rules would instead damage the interests of the sect, then there would be no use for their existence.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For example, if a dragon were to kill a bug from the same sect, then, according to the rule, this dragon would have to be put to death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if that sect were to truly kill that extremely valuable dragon for the sake of that worthless bug, then&hellip; it would be a true loss, utter foolery. Any clever and knowledgeable person would not do such a thing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, this untalented old man wishes to urge Headmaster Dugu that you must not kill a true genius because of some rules.&rdquo;<br>[1. Untalented is a humble way to refer to oneself.]<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng is a rare genius who might not even appear once in ten thousand years. Thus&hellip; he should not die. No, he cannot die,&rdquo; Old Daoist Wuliang of the Sword Crafting Villa urged.<br>&ldquo;What senior Wuliang says is extremely correct. Although little friend Chu Feng was indeed wrong to kill little friend Qin Lingyun, he should only be met with some minor discipline. One must definitely not cling obstinately to the rules and end up killing little friend Chu Feng, After all, if that were to be done, it would be an enormous loss for the Cyanwood Mountain,&rdquo; Following that, the other headmasters also spoke to urge against it.<br>They all knew that Dugu Xingfeng was unwilling to kill Chu Feng and would also not kill Chu Feng. After all, if it were them, they too would not kill their sect&rsquo;s genius like this.<br>Thus, they were all trying to curry some favor by giving him a reason to not kill Chu Feng, At the same time, they were also trying to leave a good impression on Chu Feng by pleading for him in front of his face.<br>When they could kill two birds with one stone, how could they not do it?<br>&ldquo;What everyone has said is exactly what I&rsquo;m thinking too,&rdquo; Dugu Xingfeng nodded with a smile.<br>After hearing those words, the expressions of Bai Yunxiao and the other disciples who had rushed up to report on Chu Feng turned extremely ugly. It was as if they had been fed feces to eat.<br>What was this? Their headmaster did not plan to kill Chu Feng. In that case, wouldn&rsquo;t their accusation toward Chu Feng be asking for trouble?<br></p></div>
