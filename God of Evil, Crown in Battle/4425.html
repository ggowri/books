        <h1>Chapter 4424</h1>
        <div>: I Call the Shots Here<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Pui! My elder sister can&rsquo;t possibly know a monster like you! I feel disgusted just to hear a lowly monster who is no more than a toad talking to me! How dare someone like you hurt my senior?<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead meat! Not only are you going to die, I&rsquo;ll make sure that every single person from the Chu Heavenly Clan is going to die for your sin! You should know that someone like you has no say at all before our Cloudsky Immortal Sect!&rdquo;<br>Yin Daifen spoke with killing intent raging in her eyes.<br>She was not joking at all. She was intending to do as she said.<br>Even though she was Yin Daifen&rsquo;s younger sister, her personality was very different from that of Yin Daifen&rsquo;s. She was domineering and unreasonable, and these were traits that Chu Feng repulsed.<br>A cold glint flickered across Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Swoosh!<br>After dodging another one of Yin Daifen&rsquo;s attacks, Chu Feng suddenly stepped forward instead of retreating, and his arm darted forth in a streak of shadow to strike Yin Daifen.<br>Alarmed by the abrupt counterattack, Yin Daifen immediately attempted to dodge, but it was already too late.<br>Pak!<br>Like an eagle&rsquo;s claw, Chu Feng grabbed Yin Daifen&rsquo;s arm tightly.<br>Ah!<br>Yin Daifen cried in pain as the pink sword in her grasp fell to the floor.<br>As it turned out, Chu Feng had actually snapped her hand off her arm.<br>However, after crippling Yin Daifen, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t continue to hurt her. Instead, with a flip of his arm, he flipped the ranting Yin Daifen onto the ground.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that I won&rsquo;t dare to touch you just because you&rsquo;re a woman. I have no intention of tolerating your domineering and unreasonable attitude,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked down at Yin Daifen as he uttered coldly.<br>&ldquo;You beast! I&rsquo;ll kill you! I&rsquo;ll rip you into pieces!&rdquo; Yin Daifen cried furiously.<br>Following that, dark clouds actually began above them, shrouding the sky for thousands of li.<br>At the same time, the aura that Yin Daifen emanated began to grow. Her cultivation was rising swiftly, and in the blink of an eye, she was already on the verge of reaching rank seven Utmost Exalted level.<br>Tzlala!<br>But all of a sudden, a bolt of golden lightning struck down and wrapped itself around Yin Daifen, and just like her senior Fu Feiyue, Yin Daifen released a pained cry before convulsing all around the ground.<br>Just like that, she lost all of her fighting prowess!<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;<br>Putting aside those from the Yu Heavenly Clan and the Monstrous Herd Temple, even Long Xiaoxiao was confused by the current turn of events too.<br>It was apparent to them that Yin Daifen had a trump card in her possession, and her earlier mean was likely to be a skill that allowed her to raise her cultivation temporarily.<br>Yet, before she could finish raising her cultivation, a bolt of lightning suddenly fell from the sky and paralyzed her, rendering her unable to continue raising her cultivation any longer.<br>Just like that, the battle came to an end.<br>It went without saying that the golden bolt of lightning had to come from Chu Feng, but what confused them was that they had no idea when Chu Feng had prepared this world spiritist technique.<br>&ldquo;Are you confused?&rdquo; Chu Feng glanced at those from the Yu Heavenly Clan and the Monstrous Herd Temple as he asked.<br>&ldquo;Hmph, you lowly creature. Don&rsquo;t even think that you are on the same standing as us just because you&rsquo;re able to defeat the two of them&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re from a Heavenly Clan too, aren&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;ll have you know the true prowess of a Heavenly Clan today!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is the strength that you can only look up in admiration because you&rsquo;ll never grasp it in your entire lifetime!&rdquo;<br>Knowing that Chu Feng was going to make a move against them next, those from the Yu Heavenly Clan began preparing their skills, causing lightning to appear on their foreheads.<br>Vaguely, the character &lsquo;Divine&rsquo; could be seen on their foreheads.<br>It was the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>Tzlala!<br>Gah!<br>But as quickly as the Lightning Mark appeared, it dissipated.<br>Lightning had shrouded the duo from the Yu Heavenly Clan and bound them too, causing them to collapse to the ground convulsing.<br>Just like Fu Feiyue and Yin Daifen, they were incapacitated before they could even raise their cultivation. Just like that, they lost the battle before they could do a thing at all.<br>&ldquo;Y-you&hellip; Just what kind of treasure did you use?&rdquo;<br>The remaining two from the Monstrous Herd Temple looked at Chu Feng with fear in their eyes.<br>They didn&rsquo;t dare to make a move recklessly, and they didn&rsquo;t even dare to attempt to raise their cultivation. They had a feeling that as soon as they did so, the same fate would befall them.<br>&ldquo;Little benefactor, how did you manage to do it?&rdquo;<br>Even Long Xiaoxiao couldn&rsquo;t hold back her curiosity and began asking Chu Feng about it.<br>She knew that those who were chosen to come to the Godwish Palace to undergo the training were definitely the most talented prodigies from their respected powers. They weren&rsquo;t just any ordinary rank six Utmost Exalted level cultivators.<br>Just the fact that they had means to raise their cultivation was more than enough to show that.<br>In fact, if they had been able to successfully raise their cultivation, even with Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power, he might not have been a match for them.<br>Fu Feiyue&rsquo;s defeat was still understandable as Chu Feng had caught him off guard and overwhelmed him before he could even regain his footing.<br>However, what happened to Yin Daifen, Yu Hong, and Yu Yin were truly unthinkable.<br>They should have been capable of raising their cultivation in an instant, but yet, when they attempted to do so earlier, the rate at which their cultivation grew was extremely slow, such that it felt like something had intentionally curbed it even.<br>Needless to say, the &lsquo;thing&rsquo; that had curbed the growth in their cultivation was the golden lightning, but where did the golden lightning come from then?<br>It was almost as if it had appeared out of nowhere!<br>All this while, Chu Feng had been standing still on the spot, barely moving at all.<br>Thus, she couldn&rsquo;t help but be curious as to how Chu Feng managed to do it.<br>&ldquo;Lass, you want to know?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to look at Long Xiaoxiao as he asked.<br>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao nodded vehemently in response.<br>Seeing Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s expression, the corners of Chu Feng&rsquo;s lips curled up to form a slight smile.<br>&ldquo;The answer is actually very simple. It&rsquo;s because I call the shots here,&rdquo; Chu Feng told Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;<br>Those words only served to deepen the confusion on the faces of Long Xiaoxiao and the duo from the Monstrous Herd Temple.<br>Seeing their reaction, Chu Feng chuckled to himself. Then, he pointed a finger into the sky and bellowed, &ldquo;Appear, formation!&rdquo;<br>Tzlalala!<br>Boom!<br>All of a sudden, a terrifying rumble sounded all around and a ferocious gale whipped up in the surroundings. The ground appeared to tremor as the trees swayed in unrest. It was almost as if a catastrophe had befallen the world.<br>The golden lightning appeared before everyone&rsquo;s eyes like a wave of current.<br>It was a terrifying sight. It was identical to the bolts of lightning that had bound Fu Feiyue and the others, but what that really shocked all of those present was how omnipresent the lightning was around them.<br>It filled the sky and suffused the underground. It could even be seen amongst the forest.<br>It was everything within sight!<br>It was almost as if the whole world had been devoured by the ocean of crackling golden lightning!<br>Complicated golden runes could be seen covering the surface of the ground. It was the foundation of an extremely powerful formation cast over this land.<br>&ldquo;This is the reason behind it. Within this formation, anyone who tries to raise their cultivation will be bound by lightning. The lightning will enter their bodies and seal their dantian, souls, bloodline, and everything else.<br>&ldquo;Unless the person&rsquo;s cultivation surpasses the strength of my formation, or else no one will be able to raise their cultivation in here. That&rsquo;s why I said that I&rsquo;m the one who calls the shots here.&rdquo; Chu Feng explained.<br></p></div>
