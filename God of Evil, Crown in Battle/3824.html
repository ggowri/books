        <h1>Chapter 3823</h1>
        <div> - Malignant Star<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although that rainbow light was extraordinary, the crowd had yet to see through it. Because of that, Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong were the only people chasing after the rainbow light.<br>However, that rainbow light was simply too fast. Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong were about to catch up to the rainbow light when it suddenly turned around, passed between the two of them, and headed straight toward Fan Chou.<br>The speed of the rainbow light was suddenly several times faster than before. Not even Chu Feng could catch up to it. As for Fan Chou, he was struck by the rainbow light before he could even react.<br>However, after being struck, Fan Chou was not only uninjured, but he did not even receive an impact. Instead, his body began to emit a rainbow light, and he started floating.<br>It seemed like Fan Chou had been embedded with some sort of sacred power.<br>This caught the attention of the crowd present. Upon closer inspection, the crowd all realized the reason for the change.<br>A copper-colored key had appeared in Fan Chou&rsquo;s hand. The rainbow light was being emitted by that key.<br>&ldquo;Woah, that&rsquo;s actually a treasure?!&rdquo;<br>Cries of alarm could be heard nonstop. At the same time, many greedy eyes gathered on the key.<br>Everyone knew that only a single person would be able to see Grandmaster Yuan Shu.<br>As for that key, there was only a single one of it. Because of that, the crowd felt that it was very possible that that key was the key to meeting Grandmaster Yuan Shu.<br>Although the rainbow light was intense, it soon ebbed, As the rainbow light disappeared, the floating Fan Chou also descended to the ground.<br>Everything returned to normal.<br>&ldquo;Hand it over.&rdquo;<br>Right after Fan Chou landed, an open hand appeared before his face. It was Li Xiao.<br>&ldquo;Brother Li Xiao, what are you doing?&rdquo; Fan Chou asked with a look of confusion.<br>&ldquo;I said hand it over. Don&rsquo;t make me repeat myself.&rdquo; Li Xiao narrowed his brows. His voice had become exceptionally fierce.<br>Hearing his voice and seeing Li Xiao like that, fear appeared on Fan Chou&rsquo;s face. He didn&rsquo;t know what to do.<br>However, right at that moment, a figure appeared before Fan Chou. It was Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Scram,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Li Xiao.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s word not only shocked Fan Chou; it also shocked the other people of the younger generations present.<br>They felt that if it wasn&rsquo;t for Fan Chou stopping Li Xiao, Li Xiao would&rsquo;ve already given that Asura fellow a ruthless beating.<br>Logically, someone like Chu Feng should move aside from Li Xiao and keep his distance.<br>Yet, not only did he not avoid Li Xiao, but he even dared to say such words to him. Wouldn&rsquo;t this be courting death?<br>&ldquo;Motherfucker, I&rsquo;ve given you enough face! Who the fuck do you think you are?!&rdquo;<br>Li Xiao burst into anger. Disregarding all consequences, he unleashed his oppressive might and sent forth his fist, in a punch carrying wind, straight at Chu Feng. This time around, he did not aim for Chu Feng&rsquo;s face. Instead, he aimed for his dantian.<br>He not only planned to teach Chu Feng a mere lesson. Instead, he planned to seriously injure him.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>A scream was heard, and a figure was sent flying. Merely, the person who was sent flying was not Chu Feng. Instead, it was Li Xiao.<br>This scene shocked the crowd. And, upon closer inspection, the crowd were completely terrified.<br>Li Xiao had fallen into a corner. Although he appeared uninjured, his complexion was incomparably pale. He was vomiting blood nonstop, and blood poured from his nose, eyes and ears.<br>Furthermore, the crowd had been able to hear cracking noises. Those were the sounds of bones breaking.<br>Every single bone in Li Xiao&rsquo;s body had shattered. Furthermore, his injury was not only limited to his physical body. It had also reached his soul. Otherwise, Li Xiao would not be in such serious pain.<br>Although the crowd had not managed to sense Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation, his attack was truly ruthless.<br>&ldquo;I had already given you face.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a cold voice was heard.<br>It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng was the one who had said those words to Li Xiao.<br>At that moment, the crowd all turned their gazes over to him.<br>When they looked at Chu Feng again, the crowd all grew tense, and started shivering with fear.<br>It was only at that moment that they realized the fellow by the name of Asura was no coward at all. Instead, he was a malignant star.<br>&ldquo;All of you, listen up. This key has chosen Fan Chou of its own accord. This is Fan Chou&rsquo;s luck, his fate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will be frank. If anyone is to attempt to snatch his key like that Li Xiao, Li Xiao&rsquo;s injuries shall be the lightest.&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice was as loud as thunder. His gaze was as sharp as a blade.<br>Many people did not dare to look him in the face. They naturally did not dare to go against him either.<br>However, there were always exceptions to the rule.<br>&ldquo;Who do you think you are? You dare to gesticulate at us while speaking?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should go and make some inquiries. Every one of us here is of noble birth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your daddy I do not know what your cultivation might be. I also do not know where you&rsquo;re from. However, you&rsquo;re not qualified to act impudently here!&rdquo; A gorgeously dressed man with a pointed mouth and monkey-like cheeks stood forth.<br>Not only did he step forward, he was also gesticulating at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Oh? In that case, dare I ask, who are you and where are you from?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Listen carefully to your daddy. Your daddy is named Liang Fengxue. I am the young villa master of the Snowmountain Sword Villa. My father is a peak Exalted.&rdquo; That man smacked his chest with a look of confidence, pride and arrogance.<br>&ldquo;Snowmountain Villa&rsquo;s Liang Fengxue, was it? Come, come over here." Chu Feng gestured at Liang Fengxue.<br>&ldquo;Motherfucker! You dare to signal your daddy around?! You&rsquo;re truly seeking a beating!&rdquo; As that Liang Fengxue spoke, he walked towards Chu Feng. As he walked, strong winds rose and started wreaking havoc everywhere.<br>That Liang Fengxue possessed the cultivation of a rank eight Martial Immortal. His cultivation was a level above Li Xiao's. It was no wonder he was so confident.<br>However, Chu Feng merely sent forth a palm strike, and that Liang Fengxue let out a scream and was sent flying, landing beside Li Xiao.<br>When Liang Fengxue landed, he was completely covered in blood. Li Xiao had only as all his bones shattered. However, Liang Fengxue not only had all the bones in his body shattered, but his flesh was also completely mutilated. Upon landing, he started screaming nonstop. It was like he was being tortured.<br>&ldquo;Listen carefully, I don't care who you are and where you&rsquo;re from. In here, you&rsquo;d all best act respectfully. Otherwise, I will have you suffer even more than that Liang Fengxue.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng pointed to Liang Fengxue and swept his cold gaze across the crowd.<br>Although the remaining people of the younger generation were all furious, they did not dare to even utter a single fart.<br>If one hadn&rsquo;t witnessed everything with one&rsquo;s very eyes, it would truly be difficult to believe that the people that were pale, shivering in fear and avoiding Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze were the same people that had been mocking, ridiculing and blaming him earlier.<br>This was truly a display of people that bullied the weak and feared the strong.<br>&ldquo;Brother Fan Chou, go on ahead. With me here, I guarantee that you&rsquo;ll be safe.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng turned around and said to Fan Chou.<br>The fierce Chu Feng had become completely different when facing Fan Chou.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, thank you. However, your attacks were truly too ruthless, no?&rdquo; Fan Chou said with trembling fear.<br>&ldquo;No, not at all. If anyone dares bother with superfluous words again, I will let you know what it means to be ruthless,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the people of the younger generation behind all grew tense. Their expressions turned even uglier.<br>Chu Feng was clearly saying those words for them to hear.<br>Threatening. He was obviously threatening them.<br>However, none of the younger generations dared to refute him.<br>After all, they had learned that that Asura fellow was not someone who bluffed. He was truly vicious and merciless.<br>&ldquo;Damned brat, I&rsquo;ll let you continue to act arrogantly here. Once you exit this place, you shall see how I&rsquo;ll put you to death.&rdquo;<br>Although the people of the younger generation were no longer saying anything, they had not really submitted to Chu Feng.<br>In fact, occasionally, malice would flash through their eyes as they looked at him.<br></p></div>
