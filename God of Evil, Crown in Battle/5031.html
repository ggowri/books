        <h1>Chapter 5030</h1>
        <div>: A Prodigious World Spiritist<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Milord, please let us go!&rdquo;<br>The two men began pleading for mercy while struggling furiously to break free. They could already foresee their fate when they saw those corpses littered around the sleeping chamber, so how could they not be afraid?<br>Their cries caught Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s attention. He began to examine the two of them intently.<br>&ldquo;Oh hoh. The two of you look not too bad. Come here and have fun with me!&rdquo;<br>With a sinister smile, Jiang Kongping pulled them into his sleeping chamber with a powerful suction force, and the doors immediately closed shut right after.<br>Chu Feng managed to sneak in before the doors closed.<br>&ldquo;Hm? It looks like a rat has snuck in with you.&rdquo;<br>The moment Chu Feng stepped into the room, Jiang Kongping directed his gaze in his direction, which was weird considering that Chu Feng had already concealed his presence using his spirit power.<br>However, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t surprised by that. He had already noticed that the sleeping chamber was a formation space, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising that Jiang Kongping would be able to detect his presence here.<br>He decided not to beat around the bush and reveal himself.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Jiang Kongping, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You know me? Seems like you aren&rsquo;t from the Eastern Region. Do you have any business with me?&rdquo; Jiang Kongping asked.<br>&ldquo;You should know who Sima Xiangtu is, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re his subordinate?&rdquo; Jiang Kongping asked.<br>&ldquo;I have some friends who are in his hands. I need you to come along with him so as to get him to free them,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Interesting! In other words, you wish to kidnap me in order to force Sima Xiangtu to release your friends?&rdquo; Jiang Kongping asked.<br>&ldquo;You can say so.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng shrugged nonchalantly.<br>&ldquo;I never thought that a day would come where someone would dare to threaten me. The question is&hellip; are you qualified?&rdquo;<br>Killing intent flashed across Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s eyes.<br>The next moment, Chu Feng sensed spirit power gushing out from Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s body, harnessing might comparable to a rank seven Martial Exalted level cultivator. It morphed into a sharp sword that sought to lop off Chu Feng&rsquo;s head.<br>Jiang Kongping was a rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist.<br>While Chu Feng was currently at rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation, he was able to raise his spirit power up to a level comparable to a rank seven Martial Exalted level cultivator through his Nine Dragons Saint Cloak and his world spiritist bloodline.<br>Thus, he chose not to resort to his martial power but his spirit power instead.<br>He quickly formed a layer of barrier in front of him, which resulted in Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s spirit power sword slashing down on the barrier instead.<br>Bam! Crack!<br>Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s spirit power sword shattered into pieces, but Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes also turned severe as well.<br>He discovered a sharp sword cut on his barrier.<br>It made him realize that he had underestimated Jiang Kongping. The latter was not just any ordinary rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist; in terms of prowess, he wasn&rsquo;t lacking in any way compared to Chu Feng at all.<br>&ldquo;Oh? You&rsquo;re a rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist too? It looks like I&rsquo;ve underestimated you. Interesting, interesting. Since that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll have some fun with you.&rdquo;<br>Jiang Kongping formed a series of hand seals before pointing a finger at Chu Feng.<br>Whoosh!<br>A furious roar echoed.<br>A ferocious golden tiger manifested from Jiang Kongping and began charging at Chu Feng. It started out small, but its size continuously increased as it picked up speed. In the blink of an eye, it had already expanded to over fifty meters in length. The might it emanated was also terrifying.<br>&ldquo;He was able to set up such a powerful offensive formation in moments?&rdquo;<br>The formation was formidable, but the way Jiang Kongping controlled it was also masterful.<br>Not daring to make light of his enemy, Chu Feng quickly formed a series of hand seals and released an offensive formation of his own too.<br>He thrust his palm forward and formed a world spiritist gate.<br>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!<br>Countless arrows shot forth from the world spiritist gate, hurtling straight toward the ferocious tiger.<br>Grar!<br>The ferocious tiger let out a roar. It had chosen to face the arrows face-on instead of dodging them.<br>The arrows swiftly piled up on the tiger, causing its body to tear. Nevertheless, the tiger still continued charging forward with extreme tenacity.<br>Whoosh!<br>Seeing that things weren&rsquo;t to his advantage, Chu Feng quickly set up a formation on his feet to hasten his speed. He leaped into the sky and dodged the tiger&rsquo;s attack.<br>However, that wasn&rsquo;t enough to shake the tiger off his back. As soon as the tiger missed its attack, it turned around and pounced into the air to chase after Chu Feng, baring its fangs at him.<br>To make things worse, its speed was even faster than before.<br>Shoosh!<br>With a sudden flash of light, the tiger was severed into two before dissipating amidst a whiff of spirit power.<br>It turned out that there was a hundred-meter-long formation sword in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands.<br>He had summoned the arrows beforehand to weaken the tiger&rsquo;s attack before slicing it apart with his sword, or else he would have been overpowered by the tiger instead. In fact, cracks had started appearing on his sword, making it no longer usable.<br>That was how powerful the formation tiger was.<br>&ldquo;It looks like you&rsquo;re an expert. You were able to set up two offensive formations within such a short period of time. Not bad at all,&rdquo; Jiang Kongping said.<br>Chu Feng looked at Jiang Kongping once more and saw that he had put on his clothes. Amazingly, the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s robe made him look like a dignified gentleman.<br>They had barely clashed with each other earlier on, but Chu Feng realized that Jiang Kongping was not to be made light of. In fact, the latter was the strongest junior world spiritist he had encountered thus far.<br>Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s formation wielded superior prowess to Chu Feng in terms of might, which was only to be expected considering that he was from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, a power renowned throughout the entire world of cultivation.<br>A prodigy that came from such a sect was bound to be outstanding.<br>What left Chu Feng even more surprised was that the tiger formation should have been incredibly hard to control, but Jiang Kongping was able to do it with ease.<br>The other party was indeed a true prodigy.<br>Knowing that he had encountered a powerful enemy, Chu Feng&rsquo;s interest was piqued. He decided to have a showdown with Jiang Kongping using spirit power.<br>While Chu Feng was assessing Jiang Kongping, the latter was also assessing him as well. There was admiration in his eyes, just that there was a tinge of something else mixed in it that left Chu Feng feeling incredibly uncomfortable.<br></p></div>
