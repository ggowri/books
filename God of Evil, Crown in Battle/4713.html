        <div>: Destroying Relationships<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you in there?&rdquo;<br>Not too long after Chu Feng turned his attention back to deciphering the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor, another woman&rsquo;s voice suddenly sounded by the doorway. This time around, it wasn&rsquo;t Wang Ziyan but Tu Yuanyuan.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong for you to come over at this time?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng opened the door and looked at Tu Yuanyuan in surprise.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk inside.&rdquo;<br>Without waiting for Chu Feng to answer, she had already headed right in on her own accord. Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t stop her either and simply closed the door behind her.<br>&ldquo;Waa, what sumptuous dessert do you have here? It looks like prodigies like you are indeed different. It hasn&rsquo;t even been a day since you made your name, and you&rsquo;re already accorded such treatment.&rdquo;<br>Tu Yuanyuan was not the type to hold herself back. Without asking Chu Feng, she reached out for the desserts on the table and stuffed it into her mouth.<br>As she ate, her head swayed from side to side in contentment.<br>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t possibly have come all the way to my place to look for food, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. I&rsquo;ve just heard of your matter. You sure are an impressive person. I never thought that you would trigger the legendary god aptitude.&rdquo;<br>Tu Yuanyuan shot a thumbs up toward Chu Feng amidst stuffing her cheeks.<br>&ldquo;Looks like news spread fast in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. So, you came all the way here to congratulate me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this something worth congratulating? I knew that you would make your name here, but I didn&rsquo;t think that you would do it so quickly. In my view, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before you get yourself a slot amongst the Hidden Dragon Disciples! Aside from that, however, I&rsquo;m also here to remind you of something.&rdquo;<br>At this point, Tu Yuanyuan finally put down the desserts in her hands, and her eyes turned a little grave.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You should remember Elder Ouyang Che, right?&rdquo; Tu Yuanyuan asked.<br>&ldquo;I do. My memory isn&rsquo;t that bad,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>How could he not remember Ouyang Che? That fellow was an elder of the East Dragon Hall. Shortly after the entrance aptitude test, there was a selection where the elders would choose the disciples they wanted to take in. Ouyang Che chose Hua Xu back then.<br>Hua Xu wanted to use Ouyang Che to deal with Chu Feng back then, and the latter was more than willing to help him. However, after Chu Feng revealed his cultivation, Ouyang Che ended up regretting his decision. In order to take Chu Feng in as his disciple, he didn&rsquo;t hesitate to annul his master-disciple relationship with Hua Xu on the spot.<br>&ldquo;Elder Ouyang Che has been punished. He&rsquo;s currently demoted to an outer elder,&rdquo; Tu Yuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was probing deeper into it because Tu Yuanyuan specially came all the way here to inform him of the matter. Most likely, there was something deeper to it.<br>&ldquo;It seemed like some of the shadier deeds he did in the past got exposed, so the punishment looks legitimate on the surface. However&hellip; this matter isn&rsquo;t as simple as it seems. It turns out that Hua Shengping is of the same race as Hua Xu, making him Hua Xu&rsquo;s elder,&rdquo; Tu Yuanyuan explained.<br>&ldquo;I get it. In other words, Hua Xu got Hua Shengping to get back at Ouyang Che,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty much what everyone is thinking. Back then, Ouyang Che slapped Hua Xu while annulling their relationship, so Hua Xu wanted vengeance. However, you have also riled up Hua Xu the other day, and Hua Xu is quite a narrow-minded person. Now that he has a powerful backing, there&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;ll let you off,&rdquo; Tu Yuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Is Hua Shengping very powerful?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s his current cultivation level, but he has quite some standing in the East Dragon Hall. Hua Shengping&rsquo;s master is the Law Enforcement Elder of the East Dragon Hall. You should know that there are only ten Law Enforcement Elders in each of the halls, and they possess great strength and authority.<br>&ldquo;Due to that, hardly anyone dares to offend Hua Shengping in the East Dragon Hall,&rdquo; Tu Yuanyuan explained.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect Hua Xu to have such an elder behind him. Interesting,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, aren&rsquo;t you afraid?&rdquo;<br>Tu Yuanyuan was surprised to see how Chu Feng was taking all of this lightly. A normal person should at least show a bit of nervousness or something.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to be afraid about? I just have to deal with it when problems come my way. What&rsquo;s bound to come will eventually come,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;You sure can take things in stride. Anyway, I still feel obliged to remind you to tread carefully. Hurry up and find backing for yourself. With your talent, it shouldn&rsquo;t be hard for you to get someone on your side. Even after that, you should try to stay low. Don&rsquo;t get into any trouble if possible. Otherwise, Hua Shengping will definitely try to get you,&rdquo; Tu Yuanyuan advised.<br>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>While Tu Yuanyuan had exterior motivations in mind, it was still a fact that she chose to tip him off despite knowing that Hua Xu had a powerful backing now. This made him feel a little touched.<br>After all, she could be placed in a dangerous position if she were to be caught walking too close to him at this juncture.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to be so distant with me. I&rsquo;m your junior after all! Alright, I need to leave now, or else it wouldn&rsquo;t look good if people were to catch me visiting your residence in the middle of the night.&rdquo;<br>With that, Tu Yuanyuan quickly took her leave.<br>Chu Feng noticed that she had used some sort of means to conceal her body before heading out. From this, it could be seen that she was a meticulous person.<br>Her actions showed her reluctance to reveal the close relationship between the two of them, but Chu Feng could understand where she was coming from. Tu Yuanyuan was a disciple of the East Dragon Hall, and Hua Xu and Hua Shengping were both in the East Dragon Hall too.<br>Regardless of whatever identity Tu Yuanyuan has outside of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, she couldn&rsquo;t rely on those now. The only backing she had within the sect was her master. Given so, there was indeed a need for her to proceed warily.<br>&hellip;<br>One thing that was worth noting was that Yu Sha&rsquo;s guess was spot-on.<br>After Wang Ziyan was rejected by Chu Feng, she headed straight for Song Xi&rsquo;s residence with tears in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;You said that Chu Feng disrespected you?&rdquo;<br>Song XI looked at the crying Wang Ziyan with rage in his eyes. He had already learned about what had happened earlier through her&hellip; and needless to say, Wang Ziyan wasn&rsquo;t going to reveal the truth here.<br>&ldquo;Senior Song, do you think that I would lie to you? I thought that given that I&rsquo;m your woman, it&rsquo;s only right for me to show some concern for your brother too, so I sent some desserts over to Chu Feng out of goodwill. Yet, who could have thought that he&rsquo;s actually a beast! As soon as I walked in, he&hellip;<br>&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t fought him off desperately with all of my strength, I could very well be&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At this point, Wang Ziyan broke down into tears, as if she had suffered a great grievance.<br>&ldquo;So, nothing happened to you in the end, right?&rdquo; Song Xi asked.<br>&ldquo;I warned him that I&rsquo;m your woman, but Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t back down at all. Instead, he sneered at me, saying that his talent is above you. He said that it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before he becomes the number one disciple of the North Tortoise Hall, so you&rsquo;re nothing worthy of mention. In the end&hellip; If not for me threatening him with my life, I might not have been able to get away from him!&rdquo; Wang Ziyan sobbed.<br>&ldquo;Ziyan, stop crying. Come over here.&rdquo;<br>Song Xi beckoned to Wang Ziyan.<br>Wang Ziyan immediately walked over and leaped into Song Xi&rsquo;s embrace.<br>Pah!<br>Unexpectedly, Song Xi flicked his sleeves and sent a resounding slap onto her face, sending her tumbling across the room.<br></p></div>
