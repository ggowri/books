        <h1>Chapter 3543</h1>
        <div> - Sacred Fruits<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as that undead had said, Chu Feng had already seen through the illusory formation. If he wanted to leave, he would&rsquo;ve been able to leave long ago.<br>The reason why he was still in the illusory formation was because he wanted to breach it completely.<br>Should he completely breach the illusory formation, not only would he be able to find the disappeared golden fruit, but he would also be able to make other gains.<br>Merely, Chu Feng also had no idea what those other gains might be. All he knew was that it should be some sort of treasure, as it was what had created the illusory formation.<br>Fortunately, Chu Feng had discovered the method to breach the illusory formation. Furthermore, he had practically completed the layout for it.<br>As for how he was able to see through the illusory formation, it was naturally not through using his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes. Instead, it was based on intuition, his intuition as a world spiritist and his judgement.<br>&ldquo;This is the place.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng extended his arm and grabbed. A golden fruit appeared out of thin air.<br>It was none other than the golden fruit that had disappeared from his hand earlier.<br>At the instant the golden fruit was grabbed by Chu Feng, the boundless purgatory started to crumble. Soon, thirty-six golden bodies of light floated out from the depths of the magma.<br>The golden light they emitted was extremely dazzling, and even momentarily blinded Chu Feng.<br>After the golden light dissipated, Chu Feng was able to see that the thirty-six bodies of light were thirty-six golden fruits.<br>After the illusion crumbled, Chu Feng&rsquo;s surroundings returned to normal. He once again returned to the Void Sacred Tree.<br>That said, the golden fruit he held in his hand, as well as the thirty-six golden fruits floating in midair, were all present.<br>&ldquo;So the power that was maintaining the illusion was actually from the golden fruits?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this many. It would appear that I&rsquo;ve made an enormous profit.&rdquo;<br>With a wave of Chu Feng&rsquo;s sleeve, the thirty-six floating golden fruits all started floating toward him.<br>&ldquo;Strange. How come they&rsquo;re different from the one in my hand?&rdquo;<br>Soon, Chu Feng discovered that the golden fruit in his hand resembled a golden watermelon, whereas the thirty-six golden fruits resembled golden walnuts. Furthermore, the thirty-six golden fruits did not emit that sort of extraordinary aura like the one Chu Feng was holding in his hand.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that even the golden fruits differ from one another.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng first placed the golden fruit he held in his hand into his Cosmos Sack. He felt that that golden fruit was different from the masses, and was likely particularly precious.<br>As for the remaining thirty-six golden fruits, Chu Feng stored thirty-five of them away. He left one behind because he wanted to taste it.<br>However, when he bit into the golden fruit, he helplessly discovered that the golden fruit was extremely hard. Its toughness had far surpassed his imagination. He was simply unable to open the golden fruit. In the end, Chu Feng determined that the walnut-shaped golden fruits seemed to not be meant to be eaten.<br>He felt that the watermelon-shaped golden fruit that he had put away should be able to be eaten. However, he was reluctant to eat it, because he was uncertain which of the two golden fruits was the admission ticket to the Sacred Palace Hall.<br>Thus, he could only keep them for the time being.<br>Then, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body shifted, and he left.<br>That said, the lake was still showing his image. It was as if the lake had locked onto Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Haha. He a-actually really man-man-managed to breach it. A-and here I was w-wondering why my bro-bro-brother would spend so long in the i-illusory formation. T-turned out he w-was planning to c-completely u-uproot your illusory formation.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had succeeded, Wang Qiang laughed with great joy. At the same time, he looked to the undead man with a confused expression, &ldquo;O-Oh t-that&rsquo;s right, Old F-Fart, h-how exactly did my brother m-manage to do it? D-didn&rsquo;t you say that w-world spirit te-techniques are useless t-there?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I also have no idea how he managed it. However, earlier, when he was roaming through the illusory formation seemingly as if he was lost, he was actually secretly tampering with it. That brat is simply too cunning. He managed to nearly deceive even me,&rdquo; the undead man sighed.<br>&ldquo;Haha. W-what&rsquo;s this, O-old Fart, y-you&rsquo;re feeling p-pained by y-your losses?&rdquo; Wang Qiang was rejoicing at the undead man&rsquo;s misfortune.<br>&ldquo;Feeling pained? If I was pained by such losses, I would not have sent him there. I merely sent him there because I wanted to test him,&rdquo; said the undead man.<br>&ldquo;W-What? Test? D-didn&rsquo;t you s-say that y-you&rsquo;re doing t-that because you were d-doing me a f-fa-favor by gi-giving my brother a God&rsquo;s Fruit?&rdquo; asked Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;If I were doing that as a favor for you, why would I test him using the illusory formation? Wouldn&rsquo;t I directly give the fruit to him?&rdquo; said the undead man.<br>&ldquo;O-Old Far-Fart, you&rsquo;re simply to-too cunning. How is it t-then? My brother&rsquo;s per-performance, it&rsquo;s p-pre-pretty decent, no?&rdquo; asked Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;So far, he has given me a slight surprise. However, it&rsquo;ll still have to depend on his further performance,&rdquo; the undead man said.<br>&ldquo;Y-you&rsquo;re s-still going to continue testing him? I&rsquo;m t-telling you this, you s-should just bring my b-bro-brother in here directly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you wa-want to revive yourself, it&rsquo;s u-useless to try to rely on o-others. It&rsquo;s better that y-you rely on my brother,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. Judging from the current situation, your brother is indeed the most probable candidate in helping me with my resurrection.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, with how talented he is, I do not want to waste it,&rdquo; as the undead man said those words, a strange expression flashed through his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Old Fart, l-let me warn you t-this. You&rsquo;d b-best not think of d-doing anything to my brother. Otherwise&hellip; I w-will kill you e-even if I have t-to place my life o-on-on the l-line.&rdquo;<br>Wang Qiang suddenly revealed a look of anger, and an attitude of risking his life to kill the undead man.<br>However, an unconcealed look of worry was also present in his eyes.<br></p></div>
