        <h1>Chapter 3638</h1>
        <div> - Excitement And Anticipation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside the chess formation&rsquo;s third world.<br>Seven of the eight treasured grounds were already occupied by people from the All-heaven Starfield.<br>Currently, Xian Yun, Kong Ci, Long Ning, Kong Tianhui, Wuming Xiongmo, Wuming Yuanzhi and the other strongest members of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were all gathered in one place.<br>They were working together to create an extremely powerful protective formation.<br>They were trying hard to guard the only treasured ground that they occupied.<br>That said, the situation was not optimistic at all. The seven people from the All-heaven Starfield were currently attacking their protective formation. Furthermore, their attacks were very fierce.<br>Xian Yun and the others appeared to be at their limits already.<br>&ldquo;Damn it. We&rsquo;ve trained bitterly for so long, and we&rsquo;re taking on seven of them with twelve of us, yet we&rsquo;re still being beaten to such a state.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Wuming Yuanzhi had a look of reconciliation. Being competitive, he felt the current situation was very difficult to accept.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never trained bitterly, okay? The ones that trained bitterly are us,&rdquo; Kong Ci rolled her eyes at Wuming Yuanzhi.<br>&ldquo;And what good does that do? In the end, aren&rsquo;t we still forced into such a state by them?&rdquo; said Wuming Yuanzhi.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Are you all starting some internal strife now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, you might as well concede.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Miss Kong Ci, Miss Long Ning, Miss Xian Yun, the three of you are very outstanding. It&rsquo;s those men from the Ancestral Martial Starfield that are incompetent. It&rsquo;s better that you all come to our All-heaven Starfield instead.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The seven from the All-heaven Starfield mocked and ridiculed as they attacked.<br>Although their attacks were very fierce, they did not unleash their full strength at all. Compared to directly defeating the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations, they took more delight in toying with and humiliating them.<br>&ldquo;Resolve the battle quickly. Do not waste time.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s voice was suddenly heard.<br>Hearing those words, the hearts of the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations tensed up.<br>They discovered that Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s voice was not only filled with impatience, but it also contained anger.<br>Even though he had always been a very cold and indifferent individual, this was the first time since they had entered the chess formation that they heard his tone turning bad.<br>Furthermore, this was while they held absolute dominance over the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>When they turned to Nangong Yifan, they discovered that not only was his tone bad, but his expression was also terrifyingly gloomy.<br>This completely terrified them, as it generally meant that Nangong Yifan was furious when he revealed such an expression.<br>With the situation being like that, no one dared to provoke him. Likewise, no one dared to disobey him.<br>Thus, they began to put forth all their power in attacking Kong Ci, Xian Yun and the others. They were planning to quickly defeat them and eliminate them from the chess formation.<br>That said, even though they went all-out in their attacks, the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were still confused. They did not understand why he would suddenly become so furious.<br>&ldquo;Xian Yun, should we just give up? We won&rsquo;t be able to last much longer,&rdquo; a person of the younger generation from Monstrous Holy City said.<br>&ldquo;Persist a bit longer,&rdquo; said Xian Yun.<br>&ldquo;Xian Yun, even if we continue to persist, it will be meaningless. They deliberately dispatched their people originally tasked to handle the third world into the first and second worlds.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, the first and second worlds must&rsquo;ve been occupied by them. Even if we manage to occupy the third world, it&rsquo;ll be useless. Besides, that Nangong Yifan still hasn&rsquo;t joined the battle, yet we&rsquo;re already in such a situation. If he does join, we simply don't have the capability to resist him.&rdquo;<br>Even the competitive Kong Ci spoke to Xian Yun about giving up.<br>She was not cowering, nor was she being weak. It was simply that she had already entered a state of despair. Without any possibility of victory, she no longer wanted to withstand such torture, and had decided to resign herself to fate.<br>&ldquo;The first and second worlds are occupied by us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as we continue to hold onto the third world, we will be victorious,&rdquo; said Xian Yun.<br>&ldquo;Ah? Xian Yun, are you certain?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the crowd all looked to Xian Yun with disbelief in their eyes.<br>&ldquo;I am the commander. I am able to receive messages from the head flag-bearers from the first and second worlds. Currently, not only are the first and second worlds occupied by us, but all of the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations have been eliminated from the chess formation,&rdquo; Xian Yun spoke with a serious expression.<br>&ldquo;Is that true?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What happened to those guys today? How did they become so fierce and powerful all of a sudden?&rdquo;<br>The crowd believed Xian Yun&rsquo;s words. However, it was precisely because they believed her that they felt so shocked.<br>After all, they felt that the people that had stayed in the first and second worlds were all weaklings. Normally, they would have a very difficult time defeating the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations, and this time around, the All-heaven Starfield had dispatched people normally sent to the third world to handle them. Yet, they managed to be victorious instead?<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>At the time when the crowd were feeling puzzled, Xian Yun said that name.<br>Hearing Xian Yun&rsquo;s words, the crowd were all shocked. Not to mention the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations, even the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were shocked.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xian Yun, what did you just say?&rdquo; asked Wuming Yuanzhi.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s young master Chu Feng. Young master Chu Feng has turned the situation in the first and second worlds around all on his own. Furthermore, he's currently on his way to the third world. Should we be able to persist until his arrival, we might be victorious,&rdquo; said Xian Yun.<br>&ldquo;Little sister Xian Yun, are you serious?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My brother Chu Feng is a newbie.&rdquo;<br>Not to mention the others, even Kong Tianhui had a look of disbelief.<br>&ldquo;Although I do not know how to explain things, young master Chu Feng has made some extraordinary moves. Likely, it isn't his first time participating in Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess.&rdquo; said Xian Yun.<br>&ldquo;Ah? Could it be, that guy was hiding his strength?&rdquo; Kong Ci, Long Ning, Wuming Yuanzhi and everyone else all opened their mouths wide with shock.<br>&ldquo;Yifan, is that true?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All of our people in the first and second worlds have been eliminated from the chess formation?&rdquo;<br>Even the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations turned their gazes to Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to panic about? Defeat them, and we can retrieve the first and second worlds,&rdquo; Nangong Yifan said coldly.<br>Even though he did not show any fear on his face, his words presented the answer to their question.<br>What Xian Yun said was true. The first and second worlds were occupied by them already. Furthermore, it was Chu Feng who had turned the situation around.<br>&ldquo;Motherfucker! Never would I have imagined that bastard Chu Feng to have concealed his skills so deeply!&rdquo; Wuming Yuanzhi cursed out loud. Even though he was cursing, he had an excited and joyous smile on his face.<br>He was not the only one. All twelve people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield were extremely excited.<br>At the same time, they all had looks of anticipation.<br>They truly wanted to witness what sort of ability Chu Feng possessed in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess.<br></p></div>
