        <h1>Chapter 4198</h1>
        <div> - This Is Utmost Exalted!<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Done for, we're done for.&rdquo;<br>This was what everyone was thinking.<br>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng shot forth a palm strike.<br>Boundless martial power swept forth.<br>The martial power rapidly expanded; it squirmed as it expanded in size.<br>Soon, an enormous martial power palm appeared, reaching several tens of thousands of meters across.<br>Even space itself shattered before the martial power palm.<br>When they saw the martial power palm, those Exalted-level spirit formation beasts began to shriek in fear. They immediately turned around and began fleeing.<br>It turned out that those spirit formation beasts were capable of feeling fear.<br>Unfortunately, they were too late. Chu Feng&rsquo;s giant martial power palm smashed forth explosively.<br>Where the giant martial power palm passed, all living beings were destroyed. The sky collapsed and the earth caved in.<br>One after another, the enormous spirit formation beasts were pulverized by the giant martial power palm.<br>In an instant, the spirit formation beasts that had covered a region of the sky had all been obliterated.<br>This was not only witnessed by the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed old monk, it had also been witnessed by old man Zhao, Zhao Menglu, Xiao Yu and all the other residents.<br>Without exception, the people present were all stunned.<br>Their faces were no longer covered in shock. Instead, they showed terror. They were all terrified by the scene they&rsquo;d just witnessed.<br>However, what terrified them was not the spirit formation beasts. Rather, it was Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng was standing in the distant sky with his back to them.<br>His silhouette was small.<br>Yet, the impact it brought upon them was immense!<br>&ldquo;Senior, it&rsquo;s been a long time.&rdquo;<br>Right when the crowd was still stunned, Chu Feng arrived before the plain-clothed old monk and greeted him respectfully.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t possibly have really reached the Utmost Exalted realm, right?&rdquo; the Golden Crane True Immortal asked all of a sudden.<br>He had been skeptical of Chu Feng, and had even felt that he had ended up saying nonsense because he had suffered some shock.<br>However, he had begun to doubt himself.<br>&ldquo;Utmost Exalted realm?&rdquo;<br>The plain-clothed old monk was astonished upon hearing the words that were spoken by the Golden Crane True Immortal.<br>Even though he had witnessed Chu Feng obliterating those omnipresent Exalted-level spirit formation beasts with a single palm strike with his very eyes, he had thought Chu Feng to merely be an Exalted of a higher level than those spirit formation beasts at the very most.<br>Utmost Exalted?<br>That was something that he had never even dared to imagine.<br>Hearing this question from the Golden Crane True Immortal, Chu Feng suddenly smiled.<br>The Golden Crane True Immortal was doubting him.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s clothes began to flutter. Then, a boundless aura was released from his body.<br>That aura was so powerful that it covered tens of thousands of miles.<br>The mountain, rivers, lakes and oceans were all instantly enveloped by Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura.<br>His aura was so powerful that it controlled everything within the region.<br>With a single thought, Chu Feng could collapse mountains.<br>With a single thought, he could reverse the flow of rivers.<br>With a single thought, he could evaporate the ocean.<br>With a single thought, he could take the lives of all living beings within tens of thousands miles.<br>With a single thought, he could destroy everything and reduce them to ashes, erasing it from the face of the world!<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; is the power of an Utmost Exalted?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; is an Utmost Exalted level expert?!&rdquo;<br>Not to mention the others, even the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed old monk were completely dumbfounded from terror.<br>How could they not be afraid?<br>With a single thought from Chu Feng, they would be annihilated without even being able to react.<br>Of course, scaring the people present was not Chu Feng&rsquo;s intention.<br>Thus, he only released his aura for a split second before retrieving it.<br>But, even with that being the case, many people still fell powerlessly to the ground in fear. Some even fainted.<br>Many pissed themselves in fear. Some even started weeping.<br>This was especially true for Xiao Yu. He was lying on the ground. His body was not just trembling, it was twitching.<br>Just thinking back to how he had dared to provoke an Utmost Exalted-level existence, and had even punched that Utmost Exalted-level existence, he was in so much fear that he felt like dying.<br>At the same time, he finally realized why his hand wouldn't heal.<br>It turned out that the person he had hit was actually a paramount Utmost Exalted-level existence!<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve truly broadened my horizons,&rdquo; the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed old monk said at the same time.<br>For the others, they would at most be terrified by Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength. But, for the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed old monk, they were in complete awe.<br>Back in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, Chu Feng had been a person of the younger generation that still needed their protection.<br>Yet, in the blink of an eye, he had grown so much.<br>He had grown to reach a level where he could easily obliterate all the monsters that they could not contend against.<br>It had only been several years. To martial cultivators, that amount of time was simply nothing.<br>Yet, in such a short period of time, Chu Feng had undergone such a massive change.<br>After calming down slightly, the Golden Crane True Immortal asked again, &ldquo;In that case, it would mean that you&rsquo;re really Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, why would I lie to you about that?&rdquo; Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or cry. He did not expect the Golden Crane True Immortal to doubt that too.<br>&ldquo;This old man was foolish. This old man was foolish,&rdquo; the Golden Crane True Immortal laughed.<br>&ldquo;Back then, your father had stunned both of us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that you&rsquo;d end up stunning us even more today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truly the son of a tiger cannot possibly be a dog. Truly like father like son.&rdquo;<br>Both the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain-clothed old monk were sighing with admiration repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, another voice was heard.<br>It was actually old man Zhao. Old man Zhao had a smile on his face. He was also dragging along his granddaughter, Zhao Menglu.<br>But, compared to the high-spirited old man Zhao, Zhao Menglu did not even dare look at Chu Feng.<br>Her body was also trembling uncontrollably. She looked completely dumbstruck as her grandfather dragged her along.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, perhaps it is inappropriate for this old man to mention this matter here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, seeing as you and Menglu have gotten along pretty well, and Menglu is also filled with endless admiration for you, if you don&rsquo;t mind, I would like to betroth Menglu to you. Is that fine with you?&rdquo;<br>Old man Zhao&rsquo;s words surprised not only Chu Feng, but also the others.<br>Old man Zhao was simply too impatient.<br>He actually wanted to set up a marriage between Chu Feng and Zhao Menglu at such a time?<br>But, upon thinking about it, the crowd were able to understand. After all, Chu Feng was an Utmost Exalted-level expert.<br>Countless people would want to marry their daughters or granddaughters to someone like that.<br>Old man Zhao was afraid that someone else would act before him, and had decided to strike immediately.<br>&ldquo;Senior Zhao, I&rsquo;m afraid that wouldn&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t do?&rdquo; Hearing those words, old man Zhao was stunned. However, he didn&rsquo;t dare to say anything afterward. Instead, he smiled, &ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, even if you take Menglu as a concubine it would be fine too. Menglu wouldn&rsquo;t mind being a concubine. It&rsquo;s all fine as long as the two of you are loving and affectionate with one another. Nothing else matters.&rdquo;<br>Hearing his response, Chu Feng felt helpless. Finally, he said, &ldquo;Senior Zhao, your granddaughter already has someone she likes.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Someone she likes? impossible.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, please don&rsquo;t listen to other people&rsquo;s nonsense. My granddaughter is a well-reserved woman. Besides, in this entire place, who apart from Lord Chu Feng could possibly obtain my granddaughter&rsquo;s fancy?&rdquo; Old man Zhao tried his hardest to explain.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled. He then pointed into the distance, at the terrified Xiao Yu, who was lying on the ground twitching, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that person your granddaughter&rsquo;s sweetheart?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
