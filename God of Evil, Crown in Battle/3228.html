        <div> - Afraid To Voice One&rsquo;s Anger<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What is going on here?!&rdquo;<br>Seeing their clansmen appearing in the plaza with diseased and dried-up appearances, the people in the plaza were all unable to sit tight anymore. One by one, they flew upward and arrived beside their respective clansmen. They began to use their various abilities to heal their fellow brothers and sisters.<br>That said, while the others were panicking, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen revealed joyous smiles on their faces.<br>The reason for that was because they had verified that the Symbols of Light could be plundered upon seeing those newcomers that had appeared.<br>To them, that was an extremely good piece of information.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what is going on here?&rdquo; Dongguo Bingyu asked the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>She had noticed the reaction of the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen. She knew that they must know what had happened to the newcomers.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, there&rsquo;s no need to panic. They&rsquo;ve merely had their Symbols of Light taken by others. They will be fine.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the situation, the people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan began to slowly explain what had happened, and what the Symbols of Light were, to the crowd.<br>After hearing the explanation from the Linghu Heavenly Clan, the other clans present began to ask their clansmen about it.<br>Originally, those newcomers were too weak and unable to answer, but after relief was brought to their injuries, they were finally able to tell the truth as to what had happened.<br>As for the truth, it was naturally as the Linghu Heavenly Clan had said.<br>After verifying the matter, the clans from the four regions all felt extremely displeased. They had all thought that their clansmen would be able to profit from entering the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>Never did they imagine that they would not only fail to gain any profit, but they would instead suffer like that.<br>Even though they did not personally witness their clansmen having their Symbols of Light taken from them, they were able to imagine how painful the process was upon seeing their pained looks and weak health.<br>&ldquo;The Formation of Light is one such cruel formation to begin with. Not to mention against you all, sometimes our Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s brothers and sisters will even plunder one another&rsquo;s Symbols of Light in order to increase their cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is also the reason why we didn&rsquo;t allow you all to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light. Unfortunately, you refused to listen to our advice,&rdquo; the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen said.<br>The crowd were feeling extremely unwell to begin with. After hearing the words spoken by the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, they felt even more unwell.<br>Unfortunately, even though they were very displeased and angry, there was nothing they could do.<br>After all, they were too weak, and simply did not possess the strength to go against the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;The one that brought harm upon you all isn&rsquo;t our Linghu Heavenly Clansmen. Instead, it is that Chu Feng. He&rsquo;s the one that brought you all into the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, he has not only harmed your clansmen, but he has also harmed himself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be anxious, that Chu Feng will soon appear here. If you all have any grievances, you can voice them to him then,&rdquo; the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen said.<br>To say such words at such a time, those Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were simply sneering at the crowd.<br>They had already harmed the newcomers from the four regions. And now, they were pushing the blame onto others. They were simply too shameless.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, we followed Chu Feng into the Holy Spirit Formation of Light. However, he didn&rsquo;t force us to enter it with him. As such, we won&rsquo;t blame Chu Feng for what has happened to us today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Not only had Chu Feng brought us into the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, but he also brought us to a site with abundant ores. He has shown kindness and grace to us, and is our benefactor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t the one that snatched our Symbols of Light. As such, there is no reason for us to blame him.&rdquo;<br>Finally, the newcomers that had their Symbols of Light snatched away were unable to contain their anger, and began to express their resentment. Even though they were all in extremely weak health, they were emitting impressive airs.<br>Everyone could sense the anger in their hearts.<br>&ldquo;Oh? In that case, you&rsquo;re blaming our Linghu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It seems that you&rsquo;re all still uncertain as to what sort of place you&rsquo;re in right now, uncertain who the ruler of this place is.&rdquo;<br>Hearing the words of those newcomers, many Linghu Heavenly Clansmen revealed angry looks. In fact, there were some that actually stood up and walked forward, as if they planned to teach those newcomers a lesson.<br>&ldquo;Forget about it. They&rsquo;re newcomers, and still don&rsquo;t understand the rules. All of you, sit back down.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Linghu Tiemian, who had been quiet the entire time, waved his hand.<br>Linghu Tiemian, who always had an ice-cold expression on his face, actually no longer had an ice-cold expression on his face at that moment. Furthermore, there was a faint smile on his face instead.<br>It would appear that he was in a very good mood. As for the reason why he was in such a good mood, it was because their Linghu Heavenly Clansmen had gained control of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>Linghu Tiemian was certain that, regardless of whether it might be those newcomers from the four regions or that Chu Feng, they would all be taken care of by their Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that Chu Feng held quite a high status in your hearts. Perhaps you all felt that Chu Feng would be capable of avenging you. However, let me give you this advice: it is best to forget about that thought. No matter how strong that Chu Feng might be, he won&rsquo;t be a match for Linghu Lun,&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian said.<br>Hearing what Linghu Tiemian said, the newcomers grew quiet.<br>It was true; they were hoping that Chu Feng could avenge them.<br>Before Linghu Tiemian said those words, that was precisely what they were hoping for.<br>However, Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s words were like a basin of cold water poured on their faces. Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s words woke them up.<br>Although Chu Feng was very powerful, he was still no match for Linghu Lun. After all, they had all met Linghu Lun before. Linghu Lun was a rank one Martial Immortal. He was definitely not someone that Heavenly Immortals could compare to.<br>How could Chu Feng contend against such a Linghu Lun?<br></p></div>
