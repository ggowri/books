        <div><span>: A Girl</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;How could Milady Queen possibly be dumb? I was really gambling on my intuition, and I&rsquo;m glad that I was right,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a confident grin.</span><br><span>&ldquo;So, you entered the red spirit formation gate not to save him but to bet that your intuition was right?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, I had a feeling that saving this young man was part of the trial,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he eyed the young man.</span><br><span>The young man was previously in a terrible state that was hardly better than a corpse. Even with Chu Feng&rsquo;s means, it would have been impossible to treat him. Yet, the young man&rsquo;s condition swiftly improved under the influx of the red aura.</span><br><span>It was almost shocking how the red aura could simultaneously possess overwhelming destructive prowess and unimaginable recovery power. These were capabilities far beyond Chu Feng&rsquo;s current reach.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Just who in the world is the master of this remnant?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng had seen his fair share of powerhouses, but the owner of this remnant felt stronger than anyone he had seen before. A remnant that was guarded by such a powerhouse was likely to contain an incredible fortuitous encounter.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Could that be the reason the Black-feathered Specter came here?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng had previously thought that the Black-feathered Specter was the master of this remnant, but it was more likely that the true master was the woman behind the red aura instead. Most likely, the Black-feathered Specter was a challenger of this remnant too, just like him.</span><br><span>The red aura soon dissipated. The young man was still in a weakened state, but he was no longer in danger of losing his life.</span><br><span>Upon recovery, the young man walked up to Chu Feng and bowed to him. &ldquo;Thank you, brother.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;While I am pleased by your change in attitude, I wasn&rsquo;t the one who saved you. It was the red aura in this remnant that dragged you back from your grave,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span><br><span>Those words brought a cheeky grin to the young man&rsquo;s face.</span><br><span>&ldquo;First and foremost, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with my earlier attitude. It was your fault for not knowing me when I am so famous. Even so, I only put on a lofty attitude; I didn&rsquo;t oppress you at all. You might be displeased by my rudeness, but I&rsquo;d say that I am already being very amicable toward a stranger here.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Also, I am aware that the energy that saved me didn&rsquo;t come from you, but I do know that it was your choice that saved me. In fact, the person I want to save has already been saved and is currently waiting for me outside. That means that I owe you two favors,&rdquo; the young man said.</span><br><span>It would appear that the young man had received some information while he was being </span><span>treated by the red aura.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is it convenient for you to reveal who you are and why you are here now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Eyy&hellip;&rdquo; The young man sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starting to wish that you&rsquo;d never find out who I am. It&rsquo;s too embarrassing. To be frank, I came here to look for someone, but I&rsquo;m afraid that I can&rsquo;t reveal the details to you. Please don&rsquo;t mind it&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;No worries,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with an understanding smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell me why you&rsquo;re here too?&rdquo; the young man asked.</span><br><span>Chu Feng roughly told the young man about his agenda here.</span><br><span>&ldquo;A curse? It looks like you&rsquo;re here for a different reason. Brother, I advise you to leave this place as soon as possible. You should have noticed it by now, but there&rsquo;s something amiss about this place,&rdquo; the young man said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave yet. I haven&rsquo;t achieved my goal,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I can only wish you all the best then,&rdquo; the young man said. It was at this point that he suddenly recalled something and asked, &ldquo;Earlier, when I stepped into the spirit formation gate, I was transported into a spatial realm, where I was confronted with a bundle of red aura that was even larger than a starfield. The owner of the red aura proclaimed herself as an emperor and said that I had to withstand her imperial might to advance ahead. I failed and nearly lost my life. Yet, you&rsquo;re standing there safe and sound. May I know what kind of trial you underwent?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The young man stared at Chu Feng intently.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Would you think that I&rsquo;m bragging if I told you that I faced the same trial as you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Haha!&rdquo; The young man burst into laughter. &ldquo;It looks like I have been too narrow-minded. Brother, I&rsquo;m unable to repay your favor right now as my Cosmos Sack has been sealed, but I&rsquo;ll definitely return the favor if we ever meet again. Farewell.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The young man bowed to Chu Feng before leaving via the &lsquo;Retreat&rsquo; spirit formation gate.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That fellow is too stingy. He could have at least given you a useful clue or something. You did save his life, after all!&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I thought that it was good that he has his own set of principles that he observes. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting him to return the favor anyway; I only helped him to clear the test,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>Eggy couldn&rsquo;t say anything as Chu Feng did have his ulterior motive for helping the young man. With that, Chu Feng began making his way toward the dark passageway.</span><br><span>Meanwhile, the young man was teleported back to the Blackwither Forest.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master, are you fine?&rdquo;</span><br><span>A person rushed over to the young man&rsquo;s side. It was a brawny old man who was almost thirty meters tall, making him reminiscent of a moving hill. He had fierce facial features, but he looked a little frightened as if he had just barely survived a disaster.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; the young man replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed. I should have been the one protecting you, but you ended up saving my life instead,&rdquo; the old man said with a lowered head.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What matters is that you&rsquo;re safe, but I wasn&rsquo;t the one who saved you. I myself was also saved by someone else,&rdquo; the young man said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Was it that girl?&rdquo; the old man asked.</span><br><span>The young man shook his head and replied, &ldquo;No, it was a young man who looks to be around the same age as me. There&rsquo;s something special about him. He cleared a trial that I failed.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually someone that formidable in the world?&rdquo; The old man also realized that the person whom the young man had encountered was likely to be an incredible figure. &ldquo;Do you know his background?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The young man smacked his head. &ldquo;Damn! I was too desperate to leave that remnant after being warned by the remnant&rsquo;s owner that I forgot to ask for his name.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master, you were warned by that voice too?&rdquo; the old man asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Too? Did you receive that warning as well?&rdquo; the young man asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, I heard a feminine voice telling me to never step into this forest ever again, or else she&rsquo;ll take my life,&rdquo; the old man said with a bitter smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I received the same warning too,&rdquo; the young man replied.</span><br><span>The two of them were people of great stature, yet they dared not to ignore this warning.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something unusual about this remnant. A huge fortuitous encounter must be awaiting inside,&rdquo; the old man said with a hint of greed in his eyes.</span><br><span>However, the young man turned to the elder with a rare grim expression and said, &ldquo;Elder Tian, I have never asked you for a favor before, but I want you to promise me one thing right now.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;What is it, young master?&rdquo; the old man asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You should know that my father is looking for a way to make a breakthrough for the sake of our clan. If he knows about this place, he&rsquo;ll definitely spare no effort to investigate it,&rdquo; the young man said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, he would.&rdquo; The old man nodded in agreement.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you absolutely mustn&rsquo;t let my father learn about this place,&rdquo; the young man said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; The elder was taken aback. He was planning to report this remnant upward because he thought that this could be an opportunity for them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you have been through, but I nearly lost my life inside the remnant. I would have been dead if not for that brother&rsquo;s help,&rdquo; the young man said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master, you met with danger?&rdquo; the old man asked nervously.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, I think that I might have encountered the remnant&rsquo;s owner. Her strength surpasses what I have ever seen before. I recklessly accepted her trial and nearly lost my life. In any case, unless you wish for our clan&rsquo;s downfall, you&rsquo;d do well not to tell my father about this place,&rdquo; the young man said.</span><br><span>Seeing the grim look on the young man&rsquo;s face, the old man finally nodded and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep this matter a secret.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Then, the two of them left the Blackwither Forest.</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng was slowly making his way through the dark passageway suffused with a red aura. He was being exceptionally vigilant as he knew that there was something off about this passageway.</span><br><span>Yet, not only did he not encounter any danger along the way, but he also began to recover his cultivation. By the time he reached the end of the passageway, he had already fully regained his cultivation.</span><br><span>At the other end of the passageway was a forest filled with blood-red trees. It was an eerie sight, but Chu Feng was already accustomed to such sceneries.</span><br><span>The first thing he did upon leaving the passageway was to rise into the air, for he sensed another aura in the vicinity. He initially thought that it was the Black-feathered Specter, but when he got closer, he realized that it was actually a lady.</span><br></p></div>
