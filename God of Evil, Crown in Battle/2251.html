        <div> - Killing Even God<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, please don&rsquo;t kill me, please don&rsquo;t kill me. Chu Feng, I admit that my heart was possessed by a ghost, that I should be killed&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I regret my decisions now. Unfortunately, my regret is useless. I beg of you, please give me another chance. Give me a condition, no, give me ten conditions, a hundred conditions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can demand as many conditions as you want. As long as you don&rsquo;t kill me, I will definitely satisfy all of your conditions!&rdquo; Ying Liangchen was actually so terrified by Chu Feng that he actually started weeping. A man who had been alive for hundreds of years was actually so scared by Chu Feng that tears covered his face. From this, it could be seen how much of a coward he was.<br>&ldquo;I do have a condition. My condition is to take your dog life,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You really are so insistent on killing me all for the sake of that bunch of old farts? You&rsquo;re willing to make an enemy of our Ying Heavenly Clan all for the sake of that bunch of old farts?&rdquo; Ying Liangchen was unable to understand Chu Feng&rsquo;s mindset.<br>&ldquo;In my eyes, the lives of that group of people that you considered to be old farts were much more valuable than your dog life,&rdquo; Chu Feng did not wish to bother speaking superfluous words with Ying Liangchen. Thus, he approached Ying Liangchen and held his hand into a fist. He was planning to kill Ying Liangchen.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at this moment, a strange fluctuation suddenly emitted from within Ying Liangchen&rsquo;s body. Then, that fluctuation took a humanoid form.<br>It was a middle-aged man wearing a blueish-black gown. He also had a head of blue hair. On his head was a headdress with the character &lsquo;Ying.&rsquo;<br>Although it was only an image, Chu Feng could tell that middle-aged man&rsquo;s actual body should possess an extremely powerful strength.<br>Likely, he should be the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Head.<br>&ldquo;Father, save me, save me! He&rsquo;s planning to kill me!&rdquo; Upon seeing that middle-aged man&rsquo;s image, Ying Liangchen hurriedly started to cry for help. His cry revealed the identity of that man. Sure enough, he was his father, the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Compared to Ying Liangchen, his father was much more calm. Like a hawk, he stared at Chu Feng with his eyes.<br>Although his image did not contain any cultivation, Chu Feng was able to sense how powerful he was.<br>Powerful. He was most definitely an expert with strength greatly surpassing Chu Feng&rsquo;s. Even though he was only an image, and did not possess any cultivation, he was able to threaten Chu Feng with only his imposing airs.<br>Unfortunately, Chu Feng possessed a resolute mindset, and was not someone that would be intimidated. Thus, Chu Feng replied calmly, &ldquo;I am called Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why do you want to kill my son?&rdquo; The Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;Your son has killed my relatives. I plan to kill him for revenge. Is there anything wrong with that?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Of course! He is the son of our Ying Heavenly Clan, a person who possesses our Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s bloodline. How could I allow you to kill him?&rdquo; The Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said with a cold voice.<br>Killing intent. Even though his image did not contain any cultivation, Chu Feng felt enormous killing intent from his image.<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, you have no means of stopping me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, your image will not be able to scare me. If you were truly worried about your son, you should never have allowed him out to commit evil.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it is too late now. I am insistent on killing him,&rdquo; Chu Feng said those words and then raised his fist again. Boundless martial power began to gather in his fist. The surrounding space started to tremble. The ground below him started to shatter.<br>The power behind his fist was sufficient to kill the already seriously injured Ying Liangchen.<br>Chu Feng was planning to kill Ying Liangchen right before the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, right before his father. He wanted the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to personally see his son being killed.<br>&ldquo;Stop! Chu Feng, stop immediately! If you dare to kill my son, even if I must search till the ends of the earth, I will still find you!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Ying Heavenly Clan will definitely not let you get away with this! Not only you, all those related to you will be killed too!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only will you end up losing your life because of your actions today, you will also implicate all those that you are acquainted with. They will all end up losing their lives because of your actions today,&rdquo; The Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief threatened fiercely.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo; However, faced with the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s threats, Chu Feng laughed. Chu Feng&rsquo;s laughter was abnormally cold. There was not the slightest trace of emotion.<br>Liu Chengkun had provided enormous grace to Chu Feng. Not only did Chu Feng considered him as a senior, he even considered him as his own relative.<br>Chu Feng had proceeded to Mount Cloud Crane and worked so hard to become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist not because he wanted to obtain stronger power.<br>His main purpose was so that he could treat Liu Chengkun&rsquo;s illness. Chu Feng had already made the preparations that, regardless of how long it would take, he would definitely help Liu Chengkun and cure his illness.<br>However, after Chu Feng finally became an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist through meticulous effort, he did not even have the opportunity to help Liu Chengkun cure his illness.<br>The reason for all this was because of that Ying Liangchen.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for him, how could Liu Chengkun be dead?<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s hatred could only be removed by Ying Liangchen&rsquo;s blood.<br>Not to mention that Ying Liangchen was merely the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s son, even if he was a god, Chu Feng would still kill him.<br>Even if he was the heavens themselves, Chu Feng must still eliminate him.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>With a swing of his hand, Chu Feng&rsquo;s fist landed explosively. Before Ying Liangchen could even utter a scream, he was shattered to pieces by Chu Feng&rsquo;s punch.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you will regret this! You will regret your actions today!&rdquo;<br>Even though Ying Liangchen had died, his father&rsquo;s image was still present.<br>At this moment, the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had an extremely ugly expression on his face. His lips were trembling, and his eyes filled with a cold light as he stared fiercely at Chu Feng.<br>Anger. Chu Feng was able to sense that the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was extremely furious; that he was like a soon-to-erupt volcano.<br>His killing intent was many times stronger than before. It was truly frightening.<br>Unfortunately, no matter how frightening his killing intent might be, he was unable to do anything to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I will wait for you to come find me for revenge. However, remember this; be sure you can kill me, otherwise&hellip; I will definitely kill you.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng said those words, he flipped his sleeve. Immediately, boundless spirit power surged forth.<br>His spirit power started to tear the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s image apart.<br>Although Chu Feng was unable to do anything to the image of the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief with his martial power, he was able to destroy the image with spirit power.<br>&ldquo;Bastard! You damned animal!!!&rdquo; The Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief roared angrily.<br>However, his voice was growing softer and softer. Soon, it had disappeared completely. His image had been completely shattered by Chu Feng.<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...<br>At the same time. In a certain palace in the Ying Heavenly Clan.<br>The Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was standing there. His posture was exactly the same as his image&rsquo;s posture.<br>Rage was burning in his eyes. He was clenching his fists so hard that crackling sounds could be heard. His surging killing intent caused his clansmen to be so afraid that they did not dare to speak. In fact, no one dared to ask their Clan Chief exactly what had happened.<br>The reason for that was because they all knew that this matter was most definitely related to Ying Liangchen.<br>However, the surging anger of the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did not explode.<br>He actually managed to forcibly contain his anger. His fortitude was definitely not something that ordinary people possessed.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief extended his finger and used it to draw in the empty space before him.<br>Soon, Royal level spirit power formed an image in that space. It was the image of Chu Feng. However, it was very vivid and lifelike. It was as if Chu Feng were actually standing there.<br>&ldquo;That man is called Chu Feng. All of you, go and investigate everything about that Chu Feng,&rdquo; The Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Milord!!!&rdquo; The crowd present all said in uniform. After bowing, they all withdrew from the room and started to investigate Chu Feng&rsquo;s identity.<br>In the blink of an eye, only the Ying Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief remained in this vast palace.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what a Chu Feng, I will definitely dismember your body into ten thousand pieces!&rdquo; The Ying Heavenly Clan Chief spoke as he gnashed his teeth angrily.<br><br></p></div>
