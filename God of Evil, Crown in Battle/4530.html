        <div>: Entrusting Great Expectations<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing how even Long Daozhi couldn&rsquo;t recognize the scenery depicted in the painting, Chu Feng suddenly felt a little despaired.<br>If that place was really located in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, there was a very good chance that Long Daozhi and Wuming Doutian would know about it. The fact that they didn&rsquo;t recognize it meant that the possible places had grown even larger. It could have been anywhere in the Holy Light Galaxy, or perhaps, even beyond the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>If it was just within the Holy Light Galaxy, it might still be manageable. However, if it were to extend to the larger world of cultivators out there, Chu Feng would be doing no more than trying to find a needle in a haystack.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s the place depicted in the painting? Is it very important to you?&rdquo; Long Daozhi asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to me. Elder, if you know anything about it, please do tell me.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t tell the truth to Long Daozhi not because he didn&rsquo;t trust the latter, but he didn&rsquo;t want to heap any stress on him.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ll help you look into it,&rdquo; Long Daozhi said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll record down the scenery on the painting too so that I can help you look into it later on,&rdquo; Kong Tianhui said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be counting on you then,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>In truth, from the moment that Long Daozhi said that he didn&rsquo;t recognize the place, he didn&rsquo;t bear much hope anymore. He didn&rsquo;t think that it was likely that they would really be able to find it. Nevertheless, he still thanked them for their sentiments.<br>&ldquo;Oh right, elder, I&rsquo;m quite curious to know why you have suddenly invited so many different powers over to your Ancestral Martial Dragon City,&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Long Daozhi.<br>He knew that Long Daozhi wouldn&rsquo;t do such a thing for no reason.<br>&ldquo;Actually, there&rsquo;s a deeper reason behind this.&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi began explaining the situation to Chu Feng.<br>As it turned out, this had something related to why the Ancestral Martial Dragon City was build here in the first place. The area around the Ancestral Martial Dragon City was filled with many remnants and secret cultivation grounds, as well as an Ancient Era&rsquo;s mystic ground.<br>It was just that the Ancestral Martial Dragon City had been unable to open the Ancient Era&rsquo;s mystic ground all this while despite having tried many different methods.<br>But recently, they stumbled upon a plausible method.<br>The Ancestral Martial Dragon City found that the remnants and secret cultivation grounds in this world were actually related to one another. In order to open the Ancient Era&rsquo;s mystic ground, they would have to open all of the other remnants and secret cultivation grounds in this world simultaneously.<br>However, some of these remnants would have to be opened by those of a certain bloodline, and there was a requisite on the number of people too.<br>It was for this reason that Long Daozhi invited the various powers into the Ancestral Martial Dragon City to share these precious cultivation resources with them.<br>On the surface, it would seem like Long Daozhi was generously helping them to raise their cultivation, but in truth, his goal was just to open the Ancient Era&rsquo;s mystic ground.<br>&ldquo;How is it then? Did you manage to open the Ancient Era&rsquo;s mystic ground? If not, perhaps I can help you take a look,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;We managed to open it, but the results are just a little disappointing,&rdquo; Long Daozhi said with a deep sigh.<br>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Before Long Daozhi could reply, Long Ning had already spoken up, &ldquo;The mystic ground has nothing special about it. The only thing noteworthy about it is that its concentration of natural energies is higher than that of the other cultivation grounds and remnants. We looked through the place too, but there are no treasures to be found.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh? Can you bring me there to take a look?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Sure, that&rsquo;s not a problem at all,&rdquo; Long Daozhi agreed to it without any hesitation. &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, when would you like to head over to take a look?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is it convenient now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, of course!&rdquo;<br>As Long Daozhi spoke, he rose to his feet and began to lead Chu Feng over to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s mystic ground.<br>The others present in the area also stood up and tagged along as well.<br>Under Long Daozhi&rsquo;s lead, Chu Feng and the others soon arrived at the Ancient Era&rsquo;s mystic ground. Due to how important this mystic ground was, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City was actually built around it, and the entire area was demarcated as a forbidden ground.<br>The entrance of the mystic ground was a stone door located at the foot of a mountain. This stone door didn&rsquo;t appear to be manmade as it fused naturally into the mountain range, reminiscent of a natural product of the world.<br>Nevertheless, the several thousand meters tall stone door still looked awe-inspiring. Even through its tightly shut doors, the crowd could still sense the aura of the Ancient Era flowing out from within.<br>It was no wonder why the Ancestral Martial Dragon City would value this place so much. It did feel like there was something peculiar about it.<br>Long Daozhi walked up to the stone door and took out a key.<br>The key, despite looking like an ordinary piece of stone, carried the aura of the Ancient Era as well.<br>There was a block missing in the midst of the massive stone door, and this key was able to complement the missing portion.<br>&ldquo;It has been years since our Ancestral Martial Dragon City obtained this key, but we have been unable to open up this Ancient Era&rsquo;s mystic ground all this while. However, after all of the remnants have been opened, we found that we were finally able to push these two stone doors open.&rdquo;<br>As Long Daozhi spoke, he flew into the air and fitted the key into the missing portion of the massive stone door.<br>In the next moment, the ground suddenly began rumbling, and a sharp buzzing sound echoed in the air. Following that, the two stone doors began to slowly creak open.<br>Initially, Chu Feng thought that since the stone doors were embedded inside a mountain, he would either see an underground hall or a cavern beyond the stone doors.<br>But contrary to his expectation, what lay within the stone door was a brand new world with a brilliant blue sky filled with white clouds. There was greenery everywhere, and the faint aroma of flowers tickled his nose. It felt like paradise.<br>As a world spiritist, Chu Feng was able to easily construct an independent world of his own too. However, a man made world was, in the end, artificial and unreal. Most cultivators would be able to tell the difference in a look.<br>However, Chu Feng actually found himself unable to discern whether the world beyond the stone doors was real or not.<br>From this, it was apparent that the one who created this Ancient Era&rsquo;s mystic ground was no ordinary figure.<br>After taking a look inside, Chu feng turned to Long Daozhi and asked, &ldquo;Why is there no one inside?&rdquo;<br>Typically speaking, after an Ancient Era&rsquo;s mystic ground was opened, the Ancestral Martial Dragon City should have opened it up to its clan members to cultivate within it. After all, it was a precious cultivation ground.<br>However, contrary to Chu Feng&rsquo;s expectations, there was no one inside the mystic ground at all.<br>&ldquo;We felt that there&rsquo;s more to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s mystic ground than what we see at the moment, and that it might continue to transform. So, I passed down an order forbidding anyone from entering this area,&rdquo; Long Daozhi replied.<br>&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;ll be the first one to cultivate here then?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Haha. Unfortunate, no. There have been quite a few people who entered this area prior to you, but none of them were able to sense anything peculiar about this Ancient Era&rsquo;s mystic ground. I&rsquo;m hoping that you might be able to notice something that they failed to discern,&rdquo; Long Daozhi said.<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give you my guarantee on that, but I&rsquo;ll try my best,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he stepped through the stone doors.<br>In the moment that he entered the world on the other side, he suddenly felt a jolt in his heart.<br>Long Daozhi was right. There was indeed nothing special about this world other than its concentrated natural energies.<br>Or at the very least, that was his very first perception of it.<br>However, in the moment that Chu Feng entered this world, he felt an unnatural movement coming from his Cosmos Sack. It was from the treasure which he had snatched away from the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother, the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword.<br>The Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword was a true Exalted weapon originating from the Immemorial Era. While it might appear ordinary at first glance, there was no doubt that it wielded tremendous power.<br>However, due to Chu Feng&rsquo;s weak cultivation, he was unable to tap into the powers of the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword.<br>Yet, the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword actually began reacting as soon as Chu Feng entered this place. Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that it was just a coincidence. There had to be something inside this Ancient Era&rsquo;s mystic ground that was inducing such a reaction from the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword.<br>&ldquo;Elder, can you allow me to take a look around here by myself?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Long Daozhi.<br>Chu Feng was initially planning to just take a casual look around so as to see if there were any hidden energies or something that Long Daozhi and the others weren&rsquo;t able to see through here. However, since the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword had started reacting, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t want to waste this opportunity.<br>He wanted to see if he could make use of this opportunity to truly grasp the powers of the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword.<br>The issue with that, however, was that the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword harnessed extraordinary power. It was one thing if he could control it, but if he were to fail to do so and its powers go berserk, it could very well lead to disastrous outcomes.<br>Out of safety considerations, he chose to usher the others away first before doing anything.<br>&ldquo;Of course, young friend Chu Feng. I&rsquo;ll leave the key on the stone doors so that you can leave anytime you want,&rdquo; Long Daozhi said before leading the others out of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s mystic ground.<br>Perhaps out of worry that they might interrupt Chu Feng, they even chose to close the stone doors behind them.<br>That being said, they still chose to wait at the entrance for Chu Feng so as to ensure that he wouldn&rsquo;t be accidentally trapped inside the mystic ground.<br>Long Daozhi paced around in agitation as he spoke expectantly, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng sure came at a good timing. I reckon that he must have already noticed the secrets inside the mystic ground.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord City Master, you sure have high expectations of young hero Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>Seeing how Long Daozhi was acting, the other experts of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City couldn&rsquo;t help but remark.<br>It was uncommon for him to see such an excited look on the face of their City Master.<br>&ldquo;High expectations? Hahaha, yes, that&rsquo;s indeed the case! It&rsquo;s hard not to have high expectations of him once you get to know him better. That fellow is a miracle maker! Just wait and see, I bet that he&rsquo;ll bring out something that really astounds us all!&rdquo; Long Daozhi heaped praise after praise on Chu Feng.<br>Long Ning and the others were already used to seeing Long Daozhi acting in such a manner.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t like this at the start, but the incidents that Long Daozhi went through together with Chu Feng back at the Dragon Clan, Long Daozhi had been uttering compliments about Chu Feng every now and then.<br>He might have failed to make a return back to the Dragon Clan, but that didn&rsquo;t hinder him from having a sky high opinion of Chu Feng.<br>Not only did he proclaim Chu Feng as one of the greatest geniuses of the Holy Light Galaxy, but he even showed inclinations to betroth Long Ning to Chu Feng.<br>And in truth, most of those present here had also heard about the matters that Long Daozhi and Chu Feng had gone through together, so they also carried high expectations toward Chu Feng too.<br>This also played a huge part as to why they chose to wait here instead of leaving.<br>&ldquo;Lord City Master, bad news!&rdquo;<br>But all of a sudden, a few elders from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City suddenly flew over in a fluster.<br></p></div>
