        <div> - Three Princesses<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother, Chu Feng learned of the origin of that deer.<br>The Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s golden age was actually during the Ancient Era.<br>The reason why they concluded it to be like that was because of the techniques and weapons that were left from the Ancient Era. Those were all things that they could not recreate in the present era.<br>Of the many techniques from the Ancient Era, there were many that not even the Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s Royal Clan were able to master.<br>Ever since the Ancient Era passed, the Galewind Hunting Clan had lived in seclusion the entire time.<br>Because of that, even when outstanding talents appeared in the General Clan, they were unable to enter the Royal Clan.<br>Throughout the many years of continued inheritance, there were inevitably many useless fellows in the Royal Clan.<br>Naturally, there were people from the General Clan that felt unconvinced to be ruled by those Royal Clansmen.<br>That was normal. After all, the world of martial cultivators had always been one where the strong ruled. The strength one possessed generally represented one&rsquo;s height and status.<br>Who would possibly be willing to serve those that were weaker than themselves?<br>Although there were many experts amongst the Royal Clansmen, it remained that there were also trash among them.<br>No one would complain about serving those that were stronger than them.<br>However, to be forced to show respect towards trash that were much weaker than them, many people would naturally feel very displeased by it.<br>Because of that, rebellion was something that happened many times throughout the many years the Galewind Hunting Clan had lived there.<br>Many years ago, an expert from the General Clan was unwilling to serve the trash of the Royal Clan. Because of that, he led his army into a rebellion.<br>Whilst the Royal Clan were caught off-guard, he forced his way into the Royal Nation and stole many precious weapons and techniques that the Royal Clan had kept for themselves.<br>Later on, that General Clan&rsquo;s expert threatened the Royal Clan.<br>Unless the Royal Clan were to raise both him and his family to become members of the Royal Clan, he would command his troops and, with the weapons, techniques and treasures he had seized, leave the underground world to go outside.<br>The people from the Royal Clan naturally rejected his demand.<br>Unavoidably, a war broke out. In the end, that General Clan&rsquo;s expert was defeated.<br>Because of his defeat, not only was his entire family executed, but even the subordinates that had followed him were mostly executed.<br>Only a small portion of his subordinates who did not cause any substantial damage to the Royal Clan were able to survive.<br>However, they were all reduced to members of the Dog Clan.<br>Gou Za&rsquo;s ancestor was one of the subordinates that had been demoted to the Dog Clan.<br>Back then, that General Clan&rsquo;s expert had realized that he was going to lose, and had thus divided some techniques and weapons amongst his subordinates, telling them to hide them.<br>However, all those weapons and techniques had been retrieved by the Royal Clan.<br>Back then, Gou Za&rsquo;s ancestor was fortunate enough to have been given an Ancient Era&rsquo;s secret skill. That was the paper Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother had given to Chu Feng.<br>Fearing that he would be killed, Gou Za&rsquo;s ancestor tried to return the paper to the Royal Clan.<br>However, the people of the Royal Clan thought he was trying to deceive them. Not only did they tear the paper to pieces, but they even punished him.<br>However, Gou Za&rsquo;s ancestor felt that their general wouldn&rsquo;t deceive them. He believed that, although the paper appeared very ordinary, it was most definitely a treasure, most definitely a legendary Ancient Era&rsquo;s secret skill.<br>Thus, he reassembled the paper and regarded it as his family heirloom. His family had also continued to pass it on for generations.<br>Although his descendants had been reduced to members of the Dog Clan, Gou Za&rsquo;s ancestor hoped that a descendant of his would be able to be approved by that Ancient Era&rsquo;s secret skill.<br>Should that happen, they might be able to escape and leave that place.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Even though Chu Feng had not managed to find out what exactly that deer capable of transforming into a woman was, he became even more certain that it was extraordinary after learning of its origin.<br>&ldquo;Gou Za, do you want to leave this place? If you want to leave, I can bring you and your grandmother out of this place,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Gou Za.<br>Originally, Chu Feng had had no intention to bring Gou Za and his grandmother away..<br>However, Gou Za&rsquo;s ancestor&rsquo;s wish had called to him.<br>&ldquo;Milord, you absolutely must not. We of the Galewind Hunting Clan cannot leave this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we are to leave, we&rsquo;ll die.&rdquo;<br>Before Gou Za could answer, his grandmother spoke against it.<br>&ldquo;Die? Why?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;In all these years, there have always been people trying to escape from this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only people from the Dog Clan, but even the Soldier Clan, General Clan and Royal Clan have had people that tried to escape from this place. They all wanted to check out the outside world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That was also the cause of many rebellions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, without exception, all those that left were unable to return alive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Reportedly, a calamity occurred in the Ancient Era. Although we managed to escape it and were able to live on, we are only able to do so through relying on a special sort of power buried deep underground. It is that power that&rsquo;s keeping us alive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we leave the range of that power, we will die,&rdquo; said Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother.<br>&ldquo;Calamity?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng actually thought of a calamity being a possibility as to why all the martial cultivators from the Ancient Era had disappeared.<br>Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to all disappear all of a sudden.<br>Merely, no one knew exactly what sort of calamity it was.<br>That said, Chu Feng had merely been guessing that to be the case before. But after hearing what Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother had said, he became even more certain that his guess was correct.<br>After all, he had met the Great Monster Slayer Emperor earlier.<br>The Great Monster Slayer Emperor explicitly told him the reason why his remnant soul was able to continue to survive for so long was because of a power buried in the ground below.<br>Before the Great Monster Slayer Emperor, the survivors of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms had discovered that power.<br>That&rsquo;s right. Survivors. Back then, the Great Monster Slayer Emperor had addressed those Galewind Hunting Clansmen from the Ancient Era as survivors.<br>Survivor was such a mournful word. Yet, it fully matched what Gou Za&rsquo;s had grandmother said.<br>Although they were from the Ancient Era, they were merely the survivors.<br>&ldquo;Since you all are worried, I will not force you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, before leaving, I actually have some more questions.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked to Gou Za. He asked, &ldquo;Gou Za, it seems that you all from the Dog Clan are not allowed to leave the Dog Nation. Are you not allowed to even set foot into the People Nation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Milord. Even going to the Hunting Ground to gather the remnants of the Heaven-reaching Giant Spirit Beasts&rsquo; source energies is done in secret. We can&rsquo;t allow ourselves to be discovered by others,&rdquo; said Gou Za.<br>&ldquo;In that case, besides going to the Hunting Ground, have you left the Dog Nation for anything else?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No. This lowly one wouldn&rsquo;t dare,&rdquo; Gou Za shook his head repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;In that case, I&rsquo;m confused. How did you manage to meet the Royal Clan&rsquo;s princess?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Oh, regarding that, Milord, you can say it was a coincidence.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Apart from the people from the Soldier Clan, practically no one will come to the Dog Nation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not even those from the General Clan would come. As for the Royal Clan, it would be even more impossible to expect them to come.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, several years ago, people from the Royal Clan suddenly came here. Furthermore, among them were three extremely beautiful princesses.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;One of them was the one that Milord showed me,&rdquo; said Gou Za.<br>&ldquo;You said three princesses from the Royal Clan came here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why did they come here?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;They seemed to be searching for something. They stopped here for a very short period of time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I can be considered to be very fortunate. I just so happened to be searching for cultivation resources in the trash pile. Thus, I managed to accidentally encounter them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The people from the Royal Clan are truly different. Their auras were simply beyond extraordinary. Especially those three princesses, they&rsquo;re akin to celestial faeries.&rdquo;<br>Recalling what he'd seen, Gou Za revealed an intoxicated expression.<br>Chu Feng immediately used his spirit techniques to draw two portraits.<br>&ldquo;Gou Za, have a look. Apart from the painting of that Royal Clan&rsquo;s princess I showed you in the Hunting Ground, do the other two princesses resemble them?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng handed the two portraits to Gou Za.<br>&ldquo;They really do look the same. They&rsquo;re simply the same people. Although there are some differences, it should be them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, could you have met the three Royal Clan&rsquo;s princesses before?&rdquo;<br>Gou Za looked at Chu Feng in surprise.<br>As for Chu Feng, an enormous wave was raised in his heart. He was unable to calm down at all.<br>The reason for that was because the two portraits he had shown Gou Za were those of Ya Fei and Murong Wan.<br>Merely, Chu Feng had altered them according to the distinctive appearance of the Galewind Hunting Clan.<br>The reason why Chu Feng was unable to keep his calm was because he was able to confirm, through Gou Za&rsquo;s response, that not only was Yan Ruyu there, but Ya Fei and Murong Wan were also there.<br></p></div>
