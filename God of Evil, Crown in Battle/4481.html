        <h1>Chapter 4480</h1>
        <div>: An Even More Formidable Princess<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng burst into laughter. It was a laughter that was filled with contempt and disdain.<br>Chu Feng was not an inflexible man. It wasn&rsquo;t beneath him to lower his head to this princess temporarily and serve her. However, if he had to cast aside his principles and kill a friend just to survive, he would very much rather die.<br>&ldquo;It looks like you aren&rsquo;t willing?&rdquo;<br>Through Chu Feng&rsquo;s attitude, the princess was able to tell Chu Feng&rsquo;s decision, and it made her deeply displeased. She wasn&rsquo;t used to getting rejected by others.<br>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stoop down to killing a friend just to survive,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;He actually rejected her!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What a loyal man he is. There are very few in the world who can do the same as him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a pity that he met the princess of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan. That&rsquo;s a person whom he can&rsquo;t afford to offend!&rdquo;<br>Seeing how Chu Feng actually turned down the princess, everyone couldn&rsquo;t help but feel pity for him. No matter how talented Chu Feng might be, the very act of offending the Nine Souls Sacred Clan was enough to seal his fate.<br>The Nine Souls Sacred Clan wasn&rsquo;t the overlord of the Nine Souls Galaxy for no reason. There were no powers in the Nine Souls Galaxy that dared to offend the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, let alone a lone cultivator like Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Zhao Yuzhuo, I&rsquo;ll leave this man for you to deal with. However, don&rsquo;t let him die too quickly. Make sure to slowly grind down his will and make him suffer as much as possible!&rdquo; the princess turned to Zhao Yuzhuo and ordered.<br>After those words were spoken, the oppressive might that was holding Zhao Yuzhuo down was released too.<br>&ldquo;Your Highness, I&rsquo;ll make sure to punish this insolent fool who dares to refuse you!&rdquo; Zhao Yuzhuo quickly erased the look of sorrow on his face before standing up and declaring determinedly.<br>He had known all along what kind of person the princess was. He knew that it was only a matter of time that he would be cast aside and abandoned.<br>His greatest fear earlier was that Chu Feng would accept the offer of the princess, Not only would that mean that he would never be able to exact vengeance for his big brother, but his entire Zhao Clan could very well be destroyed by him too.<br>Yet, who could have thought that Chu Feng would actually foolishly turn down the princess?<br>It was an unbelievable turn of events for Zhao Yuzhuo, but it worked to his favor.<br>He walked up to Chu Feng and whipped out a weapon that was shaped like a sword but had sharp jags along its blade.<br>The white-haired elder beside the princess immediately understood just what kind of torture Chu Feng was going to undergo next. So, he maneuvered his oppressive might to raise Chu Feng up to float right before Zhao Yuzhuo.<br>This sight made Zhao Yuzhuo even more gleeful.<br>&ldquo;I warned you. I told you that you would regret standing against me.&rdquo;<br>As he spoke, he sunk the jagged edges of his sword into Chu Feng&rsquo;s flesh with a loud &lsquo;puchi&rsquo;. A mixture of blood, flesh, and bone was torn out as he pulled his blade out of Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>This was a sword created not for battle but for torture. It inflicted excruciating pain on both one&rsquo;s body and soul.<br>Yet, Chu Feng&rsquo;s lips remained firmly sealed, not letting out even a single huff at all.<br>&ldquo;Zhao Yuzhuo, why are you so useless? You don&rsquo;t even know how to torture someone? He hasn&rsquo;t even let out a shout at all!&rdquo; the princess complained in displeasure.<br>Those words made Zhao Yuzhuo&rsquo;s face crumble. He hurriedly pierced his blade into Chu Feng again and again.<br>Once, twice, thrice.<br>Very soon, Chu Feng was filled with many gaping bloody holes on his body, making him seem hardly human at all. The severe loss of blood had caused Chu Feng to grow extremely weak, such that his consciousness was becoming fainter and fainter.<br>Yet, his lips were still tightly sealed. He didn&rsquo;t let out a sound at all.<br>Zhao Yuzhuo had managed to reduce Chu Feng to a pathetic state, but he simply couldn&rsquo;t raise his spirits at all. Instead, cold sweat was dripping down his body. He could sense the ire of the princess directed toward him.<br>&ldquo;Useless fool. Get lost!&rdquo;<br>In the end, the situation which he had been trying to avoid all this while still happened. The princess lifted his leg and kicked his body away.<br>Zhao Yuzhuo dared not say a word at all and obediently stood to the side.<br>&ldquo;You sure have backbone, enduring so much without a shout at all. Let&rsquo;s see if you can tolerate this too!&rdquo;<br>As the princess spoke, she reached into her Cosmos Sack to retrieve a jade bottle.<br>The jade bottle was around three fingers thick and one finger tall. However, as soon as the jade bottle was pried open, a black aura first rose from within before a meter long crimson worm crawled out from within.<br>This crimson worm was definitely not just a meter long because a part of its body was still concealed within the jade bottle.<br>The crowd felt goosebumps rising all over their bodies upon seeing that worm.<br>The worm was so crimson that it looked as if someone had torn off its skin, leaving just its flesh and blood behind. It had neither eyes nor a mouth, but its entire body was filled with sharp fangs. There had to be at least hundreds of such fangs all over its body, making it look incredibly repulsive.<br>&ldquo;This worm is a venomous creature originating from the Ancient Era. Every single one of its teeth carries venom that can inflict unimaginable pain on a person. If it crawls into one&rsquo;s body, the sheer pain is enough to drive a person insane right away.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you one last chance. As long as you kill that nasty lass, not only will I spare you, but I&rsquo;ll also ensure your safety from this day onward,&rdquo; the princess told Chu Feng.<br>In the end, she was still unwilling to let things go just like that. After seeing what an unyielding man Chu Feng was, she felt more driven than ever to make this man hers.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>But Chu Feng, despite his blurry consciousness, sneered upon hearing those words. Just like before, his sneer carried deep disdain toward the princess.<br>Understanding the intention behind that gesture, the lips of the princess quivered in fury. She had never been snubbed by a person in such a way before.<br>&ldquo;Very well. I gave you a chance, but you refused to grasp it. You brought this upon yourself. I shall make you kneel down before me and beg me to kill you!&rdquo;<br>The princess formed seals with a single hand, and runes began to flicker on the jade bottle she held in her hand.<br>Jip jip jip!<br>The venomous worm inside the jade bottle released a blood-curdling cry, and it darted forth to dive into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>This sight made many of the onlookers shut their eyes in shock as they couldn&rsquo;t bear to see the young man undergo such cruel torture. He hadn&rsquo;t done anything wrong at all, and he shouldn&rsquo;t have been put through something like that!<br>Even though the onlookers disagreed with the actions from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, they were too frightened of them to step forward to stop this ludicrousness. Those who pitied Chu Feng could only avert their eyes away with a deep frown.<br>As for the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, and the others, they were in an utter panic too. They wanted to save Chu Feng, but they knew that their efforts were bound to be futile. They would only be sacrificing their lives for nothing.<br>Furthermore, they weren&rsquo;t just individual cultivators but representatives of their respective power. If they were to make a reckless move here, their organizations could be implicated as well.<br>Thus, they had no choice but to think twice before offending the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>&ldquo;Hold it right there!&rdquo;<br>But at this very moment, a deep and old voice sounded from the horizon of the sky.<br>The crowd turned their gazes over and saw a humongous war chariot emerging from the far distance.<br>The princess also raised her head, and as soon as she saw the war chariot, she flinched a little. An anxious look crept onto her face.<br>The same went for the others from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan too.<br>Humongous was an inadequate word to describe just how large the war chariot was. It had palaces, mountains, and rivers on it, such that it felt more apt to call it a mobile city instead.<br>The ones pulling this humongous war chariot were massive horses with gigantic wings. These horses had white, lustrous fur that looked like jade, and they looked like divine beasts under the rays of the sun.<br>And there were tens of thousands of them.<br>Even the air seemed to tremor along with the war chariot, and the ground began to crack apart from the sheer wind produced by its movement.<br>This was a far more extravagant and imposing sight as compared to the warship of this princess.<br>More importantly, the flags of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan were hanging high up on the war chariot too.<br>Everyone instinctively knew that someone even more formidable had shown up here.<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to Your Highness!&rdquo;<br>The domineering princess quickly kept the venomous worm before kneeling humbly and kowtowing deeply toward the war chariot.<br>Everyone that was with her, including the powerful white-haired elder, also quickly did the same too, shouting the same words, &ldquo;Paying respects to Your Highness!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your Highness&hellip; Could it be another princess from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was bewildered by how figures which they rarely see around were showing up one after another.<br>Even though they had guessed that the person on the humongous war chariot was of exceptional standing, they didn&rsquo;t think that it would be yet another princess.<br>More importantly, there were some sharp-eyed individuals who noticed the fear and unease in the eyes of the princess who was going to torture Chu Feng.<br>For this princess to be intimidated by the other princess on the war chariot, it could only go to show that there was a huge disparity in their standing.<br>It was at this moment that the humongous war chariot came to a halt, and a ravishing figure flew out from it.<br></p></div>
