        <div>: Breaking Yet Another Record<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Xia Yan was threatening all of them, the crowd didn&rsquo;t blame her. After all, everyone knew that she was just doing this for Chu Feng&rsquo;s sake.<br>Tu Yuanyuan, Zhao Shi, and the others quickly gave their promise that they wouldn&rsquo;t betray Chu Feng.<br>Seeing that it was about time to leave, Chu Feng turned around to look at the forest of stone. There was respect in his eyes.<br>He knew that this wasn&rsquo;t a forest of stones but a cemetery, not just for many powerful world spirits but for the sect founder too.<br>&ldquo;Holy shit! Brother Chu Feng, you broke Lord Dugu Lingtian&rsquo;s record again!&rdquo;<br>While Chu Feng&rsquo;s thoughts were wandering, Li Muzhi suddenly exclaimed in agitation. The confused Chu Feng turned to look at Li Muzhi, only to see the latter looking toward the sky.<br>Chu Feng also turned his eyes toward the sky, where the humongous exit gate was. Above the exit gate were eight huge words: The Light of the Hidden Dragon, Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt his heart clenching up upon seeing those eight words. He remembered Duan Liufeng&rsquo;s reminder for him to never break Lord Dugu Lingtian&rsquo;s records anymore, but he actually did it again.<br>If the sectmaster was really sensitive about this matter, it would mean that he had gotten himself into deep trouble once more. If so, how was he going to remedy his relationship with the sectmaster?<br>Huhu!<br>While Chu Feng was still worrying over this matter, the exit gate in the sky suddenly released a powerful suction force that swept Chu Feng and the others off their feet and into the sky.<br>All of the other disciples in the Yinyang Withered Well Realm were also pulled toward the gate in the sky. Chu Feng and the others were one of the first few who were pulled through the gate, so they didn&rsquo;t manage to spot Zuoqiu Youyu anywhere.<br>It didn&rsquo;t take long for everyone to be forcefully evicted out of the realm.<br>At this moment, a humongous monster climbed out from the ground. There was a small figure sitting atop the monster&rsquo;s head, and he was no other than the monstrous elder who bestowed upon Chu Feng his additional reward.<br>&ldquo;Lord Long Xie, are we really going to hand the Massacre Forbidden Art to him just like this? That&rsquo;s a world spiritist technique that can destroy an entire world!&rdquo; the monstrous elder looked into the sky and asked.<br>Grar!<br>The sky quivered as the clouds billowed furiously. A silhouette that was so large that it felt like the entire realm didn&rsquo;t have enough space to contain it appeared above the exit gate. It was the silhouette of a humongous dragon.<br>Along with the emergence of the dragon, a voice sounded.<br>&ldquo;It was not my decision to give it to him. All I did was to open the gate and grant him passageway. It&rsquo;s our deceased lord&rsquo;s wish to bestow it upon him.&rdquo;<br>It was a powerful voice, but Chu Feng would have been overjoyed to hear it. He had heard this voice before&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Indeed. As long as Chu Feng doesn&rsquo;t let us down, our efforts spent building the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect wouldn&rsquo;t have been in vain. However, it&rsquo;s all thanks to Lord Long Xie guarding this area. Those old fellows have already long washed their hands out of things,&rdquo; the monstrous elder said.<br>&ldquo;This is the power our lord built. How could I possibly just wash my hands out of things?&rdquo; the massive dragon said.<br>&hellip;<br>Chu Feng had entered the exit gate in the sky together with Xia Yan and the others, but for some reason, they split up right away afterward. He felt like he had entered a chaotic world, but he didn&rsquo;t stay there for too long before leaving the area.<br>Soon, he returned to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, where the entrance to the Yinyang Withered Well Realm was. Not too long later, Xia Yan, Li Muzhi, and the others appeared too.<br>Perhaps it was because the crowd knew that Chu Feng and the others would be back, there were many people already gathered on the square at this point.<br>Before long, nearly all of the disciples who had entered the Yinyang Withered Well Realm had returned. Even Zuoqiu Youyu was back too.<br>It was just that the expressions of the elders and disciples turned a little complicated upon seeing Zuoqiu Youyu.<br>Zuoqiu Youyu was the publicly acknowledged strongest junior in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, but his current state didn&rsquo;t reflect that. His clothes were tattered, making him look like a lunatic. If not for his injuries, it wouldn&rsquo;t be too far-fetched to claim that he was a beggar.<br>While there were a lot of casualties amongst the returning disciples, none of them were in as bad of a state as Zuoqiu Youyu.<br>Chu Feng was still able to hold back his laughter after seeing Zuoqiu Youyu&rsquo;s state, but Xia Yan didn&rsquo;t have that much self-control. She laughed right into Zuoqiu Youyu&rsquo;s face, making it clear that she was indeed laughing at him.<br>They all knew that it was Chu Feng&rsquo;s doing that landed Zuoqiu Youyu in such a position.<br>As soon as Zuoqiu Youyu saw Chu Feng, Xia Yan, and the others standing together, his face immediately warped in fury.<br>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my older brother?&rdquo; Zuoqiu Youyu asked furiously.<br>&ldquo;Zuoqiu Youyu, you brothers committed so much evil that even the elders of the Yinyang Withered Well Realm couldn&rsquo;t stand looking anymore. They decided to teach you brothers a lesson! You were lucky to have managed to escape alive, but I reckon that your older brother wasn&rsquo;t as lucky,&rdquo; Xia Yan mocked.<br>&ldquo;You were the one who did it?&rdquo;<br>Even though it was Xia Yan who was taunting him, Zuoqiu Youyu turned his sights toward Chu Feng when he spoke. He knew that Xia Yan didn&rsquo;t have the means to kill Zuoqiu Yanliang, so it had to be Chu Feng&rsquo;s doing.<br>&ldquo;What does your brother&rsquo;s life and death have to do with me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a shrug.<br>&ldquo;What does it have to do with you? You can slowly think it through in hell!&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Youyu clearly didn&rsquo;t believe what Chu Feng had said. His oppressive might and overwhelming killing intent burst forth, making it clear that he was intending to kill Chu Feng right here and right now.<br>&ldquo;Stop.&rdquo;<br>But before Zuoqiu Youyu could make a move, a resounding voice boomed in the surroundings. The crowd turned their gaze over, only to see a person standing in front of Zuoqiu Youyu.<br>Zuoqiu Youyu&rsquo;s oppressive might and killing intent immediately dissipated, but it was not of his own volition but the forceful deed of the voice&rsquo;s owner.<br>The person was no other than Zuoqiu Youyu&rsquo;s grandfather, the vice sectmaster of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>As soon as he appeared, he flung his hand and gave a tight slap on Zuoqiu Youyu&rsquo;s face, causing him to tumble across the ground.<br>&ldquo;To think that you&rsquo;re a Hidden Dragon Disciple. Have you forgotten the rules of our sect? How dare you make a move on your junior? This is absurd!&rdquo; the vice sectmaster berated Zuoqiu Youyu.<br></p></div>
