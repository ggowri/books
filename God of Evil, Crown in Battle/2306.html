        <div> - He Is My Brother<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Demonic woman, look at that, is that the spirit power that is capable of allowing Wang Qiang to become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the demonic woman while pointing at the body of light.<br>Even though he was already certain that it was the case, Chu Feng still wanted to confirm it with the demonic woman. He wanted to be absolutely certain.<br>&ldquo;Yes, that is it. Although the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower has opened the Starlit Gate, its energies are still present.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, that energy is no longer berserk. My husband could use it like it is. Unfortunately, it had already entered the Starlit Gate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is truly an enormous pity,&rdquo; The demonic woman sighed and shook her head regretfully.<br>&ldquo;No, we might be able to give it a try,&rdquo; After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he began to fly rapidly toward the Starlit Gate.<br>&ldquo;Hey! Chu Feng! What are you doing? Don&rsquo;t be foolish. If you are to enter the Starlit Gate and encounter an Interstellar Storm, your body will most definitely be destroyed, and you will be killed. Even the gods will not be able to save you.&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing that, the demonic woman shouted loudly. At the same time, she also unleashed a special technique and started to emit boundless suction energy; she was trying to bring Chu Feng back.<br>Unfortunately, Chu Feng had already managed to approach the Starlit Gate. The attractive force emitted by the Starlit Gate was very strange. While it was not very strong, it created a clear contrast against the attractive force emitted by the demonic woman.<br>The attractive force emitted by the Starlit Gate was still present. However, the attractive force emitted by the demonic woman was absorbed by it.<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng had already entered the Starlit Gate.<br>Upon entering it, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze immediately changed. As he looked to the scene before him, his heart began to beat rapidly like a roaring sea. He was extremely excited.<br>If one must describe it, then the scene before Chu Feng could be described with one word: astonishing!!!<br>In the vast starry sky were countless stars. Each of the stars was a world.<br>All of this was before him. Even though they were clearly incomparably far away, they seemed to be within hands&rsquo; reach.<br>That sort of sensation was as if the entire world was within Chu Feng&rsquo;s grasp.<br>However, at the same time, Chu Feng also felt a completely different sort of sensation; the sensation of being very small.<br>In that place, Chu Feng felt that he was very small, pitifully small. He felt that he was inferior to even a speck of dust.<br>Perhaps a strong burst of wind would be able to blow Chu Feng to pieces, killing him in the process.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you cannot stay here for long. Quickly, gather that spirit power,&rdquo; Right at that moment, Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s voice was suddenly heard.<br>Chu Feng did not hesitate any longer. He extended his hand and made a grabbing motion. A burst of suction power shot forth toward to envelope the spirit power and source energy.<br>It was unknown whether it might be because Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was too weak that made his martial power useless here, or perhaps it might be some other reason.<br>However, the suction power that he emitted was simply unable to capture that body of light.<br>&ldquo;Quickly, get back here! Are you trying to throw your life away?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are currently drifting! If you do not return now, you will forever fall into that starry sky!&rdquo; The demonic woman&rsquo;s voice resonated behind Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng was also able to sense that there was an invisible energy that was pushing him toward the depths of the starry sky. He was growing further and further away from the Starlit Gate.<br>However, Chu Feng did not turn around. Instead, he suddenly moved; he continued onward. He was planning to approach the body of light with his physical body.<br>&ldquo;Truly courting disaster,&rdquo; Seeing this scene, the demonic woman grimaced; she did not even dare to continue seeing what was going on.<br>Through his efforts, Chu Feng finally managed to approach that body of light. Furthermore, he had successfully captured it with his hand.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, I am able to bring the spirit energy back. However, the source energy has already scattered. I am unable to bring it back with me. You should definitely refine it here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Hehe, that suits my intentions,&rdquo; Hearing what Chu Feng said, Eggy immediately revealed a glimmering smile.<br>Then, with assistance from Chu Feng, Eggy directly sucked in all of the source energy and refined it.<br>This stream of source energy was no small matter at all. It increased Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s cultivation from rank six Half Martial Ancestor to rank seven Half Martial Ancestor.<br>&ldquo;Not bad. It would seem that the Moonlight Immortal Spirit Flower is truly a treasure.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was able to sense the increase in Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>Thinking back, it was very difficult for Her Lady Queen to increase her cultivation. Yet, by refining that source energy, she was able to directly reach a breakthrough. This caused Chu Feng to feel overjoyed.<br>Then, Chu Feng turned around and started to hurry toward the Starlit Gate.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>However, even though the Starlit Gate was clearly not far away, it now felt so enormously far.<br>Even though Chu Feng was clearly putting forth all of his strength to run toward the Starlit Gate, the distance between them was growing closer extremely slowly.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, keep going! That gate seems to be closing!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s heart had jumped into her throat. The reason for that was because she knew very well that everything pointed to disaster should Chu Feng stay here.<br>Fortunately, Chu Feng managed to get through this daunting brush with disaster. After putting forth great effort, Chu Feng finally reached the Starlit Gate.<br>After entering the Starlit Gate, Chu Feng took a couple steps, then collapsed onto the ground.<br>At that time, he was sweating like a pig  and His health gotten very weak.<br>Chu Feng had never been so tired; even fighting for ten days and ten nights straight would not tire him to this degree.<br>However, escaping from that starry sky had exhausted nearly all of his strength.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, that Starlit Gate closed.<br>Not a single trace of its existence remained. It was as if the Starlit Gate had never existed.<br>Seeing that scene, Chu Feng felt a lingering fear. If he had been even a step late in returning, he would have been stuck in the vast starry sky. Furthermore, with the cultivation that he had, he would not have been able to reach any galaxy. Instead, he would only continue to drift in the starry sky. The only thing waiting for him then would be death.<br>&ldquo;Have you grown tired of living?&rdquo; The demonic woman glared at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Here, take that to Wang Qiang,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a light smile. He tossed the body of light that contained a dense amount of spirit power to the demonic woman.<br>The demonic woman did not hesitate. She immediately brought the body of light over to Wang Qiang and fed it to him. Then, she set up a spirit formation to help Wang Qiang refine it.<br>Due to the fact that the body of light was composed only of pure spirit power now, it was quite easy to refine.<br>Seeing that the demonic woman was walking toward him with a smile on her face, Chu Feng asked excitedly, &ldquo;Success?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Success. When my husband wakes up, he will also become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,&rdquo; The demonic woman said with a smile.<br>However, that demonic woman&rsquo;s expression turned serious immediately after. She looked to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Earlier, you would&rsquo;ve been trapped in the starry sky if you were a bit slower. I think you know very well what sort of consequence that would mean.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, you should also know very well that I would definitely use the spirit power on my husband once you obtained it. All the risks you took would only benefit him. Thus, was it really worth it for you to do all that?&rdquo; The demonic woman asked very seriously.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng said without the slightest hesitation.<br>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; The demonic woman revealed a confused expression.<br>Chu Feng smiled. He took a glance at the still-unconscious Wang Qiang. Then, he said, &ldquo;Because he is my brother.&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the demonic woman&rsquo;s expression turned sluggish. She seemed to be unable to understand the implication behind those words.<br>At that moment, Wang Qiang, who had his back facing Chu Feng and the demonic woman, slowly opened his eyes. Teardrops were actually glistening in his eyes.<br><br></p></div>
