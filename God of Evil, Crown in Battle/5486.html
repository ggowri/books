        <h1>Chapter 5486: Shocking the Crowd</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you fine?&rdquo; Long Chengyu rushed forward and asked.</span><br><span>He was still worried even though Chu Feng was safe and sound, for he knew for certain that Chu Feng&rsquo;s trial was the hardest of all.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There was a small hiccup, but it was fine,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master Chengyu, it&rsquo;s all thanks to young hero Chu Feng that we were able to clear the trial,&rdquo; Long Fulai stepped forward and said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng could tell that Long Fulai wanted to share the story, but he didn&rsquo;t think that it was worth mentioning it, so he said with a chuckle, &ldquo;Everyone played a part.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Zhizhi and the others were taken aback. They had expected Chu Feng to take full credit for his contribution.</span><br><span>On the other hand, the other Totem Dragon Clansmen revealed scornful smiles, as they thought that Chu Feng was worthy of saying those words. They thought that Chu Feng had contributed very little in clearing the ordeal but was shamelessly trying to take a slice of the credit.</span><br><span>Chu Feng paid no heed to the others and instead examined the eight sculptures on the platform. Each of these eight sculptures had been embedded with a token, with each of them being of a different appearance and energy level. Light halos rose from the eight sculptures, but they only reached up to the sculptures&rsquo; knees. Other than that, there were two empty token slots beneath each of the sculptures.</span><br><span>Chu Feng took a quick look and immediately understood what was going on.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu and Long Muxi had cleared their trials with ease. Long Yuhong faced some difficulties, but she still managed to pull through. Their tokens had already been slotted on the sculptures. Unfortunately, the fourth team, which was led by the grand elder&rsquo;s grandson and granddaughter, had failed their trial.</span><br><span>The question now was whether the addition of Chu Feng&rsquo;s tokens was enough to power </span><span>the light halos to cover the entire sculpture.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Give it a try, Brother Chengyu.&rdquo; Chu Feng passed the eight tokens he had obtained to Long Chengyu.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu took the tokens and tossed them over to the people stationed on the platform. Those people quickly placed the tokens in front of the eight sculptures.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How meaningless.&rdquo; Long Chenglu shook his head.</span><br><span>He was certain that the trial he and his big sister entered was the hardest. Chu Feng&rsquo;s team was the weakest of all, so the fact that he was able to emerge unharmed meant that the trial he had faced was likely to be the easiest one of all.</span><br><span>The easier the trial, the less the reward. How much energy could those tokens contribute?</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>Long Chenglu eyes widened to their brim.</span><br><span>The light halos had suddenly surged all the way up till it reached the sculptures&rsquo; heads.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How did this happen?&rdquo; Long Chenglu couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes. This was different from what he had expected.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That token is really powerful!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Could it be that they have really cleared the hardest trial?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd turned their sights to Chu Feng and the others. As inconceivable as the situation seemed, the energies inside the tokens were more than enough proof.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What do you mean by the hardest trial?&rdquo; Long Zhizhi and the others were confused.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Miss Zhizhi, you are incredible to have cleared the most difficult trial!&rdquo;</span><br><span>A crowd quickly gathered around Long Zhizhi to compliment her. She was the strongest one in the group, and she was the only one who was injured too. Naturally, they wouldn&rsquo;t attribute the credit to Chu Feng, and they shrugged off Long Fulai&rsquo;s words as nothing but a pleasantry.</span><br><span>Long Zhizhi finally realized that they had unwittingly challenged the hardest trial. That explained the absurd difficulty. If not for Chu Feng, they wouldn&rsquo;t have stood a chance at all.</span><br><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng paid close attention to the eight sculptures. He noticed that the light halos didn&rsquo;t completely cover the heads of the sculptures despite having reached their foreheads. Under such circumstances, the God Taboo Martial Skill wouldn&rsquo;t appear.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu also stared at the eight sculptures with a frown. &ldquo;It looks like we are still short.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chengyu, do you trust me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; Long Chengyu replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Leave the rest to me then.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng leaped onto the platform and tore off the tokens embedded in the eight sculptures.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What are you doing?!&rdquo; a Totem Dragon Clansmen roared at Chu Feng. Some of them even marched forward to stop him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who dares to stop him?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Before those people could get close to Chu Feng, a powerful oppressive might blasted them off the platform, leaving Chu Feng the only one there. Long Muxi had made her move!</span><br><span>A furious roar followed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;None of you are to disrupt Chu Feng!&rdquo; Long Chengyu ordered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master Chengyu, we are on the verge of success. We can&rsquo;t allow Chu Feng to ruin our efforts!&rdquo; A Totem Dragon Clansmen tried convincing Long Chengyu to stop Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ruin our efforts? We wouldn&rsquo;t have a chance at all if Chu Feng&rsquo;s group didn&rsquo;t clear their trial,&rdquo; Long Chengyu replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master Chengyu, that&rsquo;s all Miss Zhizhi&rsquo;s credit. It has nothing to do with Chu Feng at all!&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clansman exclaimed.</span><br><span>He had to buck up his courage to confront Long Chengyu, but his words reflected the sentiments of the others too. Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s team had cleared the trial, they didn&rsquo;t think that he had contributed much to it.</span><br><span>It was then that Long Zhizhi spoke up, &ldquo;I dare not claim credit for our success. To be honest, not a single one of our Totem Dragon Clansmen contributed to the clearing of the trial. We were nothing but spectators there.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ah? Miss Zhizhi, you&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Zhizhi&rsquo;s words astonished the crowd.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Long Zhizhi, what do you mean by that?&rdquo; Long Chenglu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are my words not clear? I&rsquo;ll be even blunter then. Chu Feng breached the formation all on his own,&rdquo; Long Zhizhi said.</span><br><span>Long Chenglu burst into laughter upon hearing those words. &ldquo;You must be kidding! How could he breach the formation all on his own? Are you telling me that you just watched by the side as he breached the formation?&rdquo;</span><br><span>He thought that Long Zhizhi was lying as it was unthinkable to him that Chu Feng could have breached the formation on his own.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We were watching by the side, not because we didn&rsquo;t want to help but because we were unable to. Do you see the injuries I have sustained? That was the price I paid for recklessly challenging the formation. I would have already died if not for Chu Feng saving my life,&rdquo; Long Zhizhi said.</span><br><span>Her injuries had mostly healed up by now, but it was not hard to tell how fatally wounded she was from the dried blood on her clothes.</span><br><span>Long Chenglu still reserved his skepticism regarding this matter.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Miss Zhizhi is right. We can testify that young hero Chu Feng breached the formation all alone,&rdquo; Long Fulai added.</span><br><span>More and more people stepped forward and backed Long Zhizhi&rsquo;s words.</span><br><span>This left Long Chenglu and the others with no choice but to trust their words, for they couldn&rsquo;t think of a reason for these Totem Dragon Clansmen to lie for Chu Feng. However, they were still unable to understand how Chu Feng was able to breach a formation Long Zhizhi was helpless against.</span><br><span>Was Chu Feng really that formidable?</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>A blinding light suddenly glowed from the platform. Chu Feng had constructed a formation using the tokens as its core. This formation emanated an aura that complemented the sculptures.</span><br><span>Chu Feng activated the formation, and light poured out of the formation and swiftly shrouded the eight sculptures. This time around, it fully covered the sculptures.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng really&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd was dumbstruck. In comparison, Long Zhizhi and the others were much </span><span>calmer, as the earlier incident had mentally prepared them for what was to come.</span><br></p></div>
