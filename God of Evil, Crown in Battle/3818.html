        <div> - Not That Simple<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng let out a cold snort at the crowd&rsquo;s insults and criticisms. He paid no attention to the crowd, and turned to Lord White Gown with contempt in his eyes, &ldquo;Never would I imagine Grandmaster Yuan Shu&rsquo;s subordinates to be this incompetent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re implying that this old man is incompetent?&rdquo; Hearing those words, that Lord White Gown narrowed his brows and revealed a look of anger.<br>&ldquo;Who else besides you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I know why you arrested me. It&rsquo;s because there were people that used special methods to sneak into the World Spirit Mansion Gate even though they&rsquo;re not within a hundred years of age.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those people possessed world spirit techniques far superior to what people of the younger generation should possess. After sneaking inside, they would be completely undisciplined and out of control. Even unleashing a massacre upon the others is a possibility. The fact that you&rsquo;ve allowed such dangerous individuals to sneak in is already a sign of your incompetence.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, you all decided to use the power of the formation core to forcibly arrest the people that snuck inside, only to arrest the wrong person, allowing the actual cheaters to continue to remain inside the World Spirit Formation Gate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is a greater sign of your incompetence.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice was loud and clear, aggressive and forceful.<br>He sounded like a judge putting a criminal on trial.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re implying that this old man has arrested the wrong person, that you&rsquo;re a person of the younger generation?&rdquo; asked that Lord White Gown.<br>&ldquo;Why ask what you already know?&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What a joke! This old man used the formation core to observe the situation inside. I&rsquo;ve observed all the younger generations inside the World Spirit Mansion Gate. What you&rsquo;ve done is something that people of the younger generation cannot possibly accomplish.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When even the first tier stone pillar was breached by you, you dare say you&rsquo;re still a person of the younger generation?&rdquo; Lord White Cloak said with a stern voice.<br>At that moment, many of the bystanders began to ridicule and mock Chu Feng.<br>They all felt that he was blowing his own trumpet, and refusing to face the truth.<br>Chu Feng completely ignored the crowd&rsquo;s ridicule. He asked, &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I breach the first tier stone pillar as a person of the younger generation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why? You actually dare to ask me why?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well. Since you wish to know, I will have you understand why you shall be punished.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The first tier stone pillar you breached contained a protective formation. That protective formation was extremely powerful. It is simply impossible for those of the younger generation to breach it. Since you&rsquo;ve managed to breach it, it means that you are not a person of the younger generation,&rdquo; said Lord White Cloak.<br>&ldquo;What a joke! The treasures inside the World Spirit Mansion Gate are all prepared for the people of the younger generation. Yet, you&rsquo;re saying that the real treasures there are treasures that the people of the younger generation cannot possibly obtain?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, why did you all even bother to create this World Spirit Mansion Gate? Could it be that you&rsquo;re just putting on a show for appearances&rsquo; sake?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Turns out, the so-called Spirit Mansion Gate is nothing more than a scam.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If someone is able to obtain the real treasures in there, they&rsquo;ll be captured by you and publicly judged with false accusations.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice was loud like thunder. Resentment and dissatisfaction filled his tone.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Lord White Gown turned pale with anger from Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>Even the bystanders were dumbstruck. They all stopped lashing out at Chu Feng.<br>They suddenly felt his sophistry to be rather reasonable too.<br>&ldquo;Shameless cheater, you dare to spout sophistry after commiting a shameless act?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord White Gown, a person like him should be punished publicly. Otherwise, if someone decides to follow his footsteps, how is our Seven Suns Mountain Range supposed to uphold the rules?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He should be severely punished to serve as an example!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the other guardians behind Lord White Gown started to speak up.<br>&ldquo;A bunch of fools," mocked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You dare insult us?! You truly do not know how to repent! You must be punished!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the guardians all took out whips with the intention of punishing Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, another spirit formation gate appeared in midair.<br>That spirit formation gate was enormous.<br>When the spirit formation gate opened, countless figures began to fly out from it.<br>Those people were all people from the younger generation that had entered the World Spirit Mansion Gate.<br>The majority of them had entered the World Spirit Mansion Gate many times already. Thus, they knew that they would be forcibly removed from the World Spirit Mansion Gate once the time came.<br>As such, they were not surprised.<br>However, upon exiting the enormous gate and raising their heads, they discovered that there was someone suspended in midair and bound by spirit formation chains. Upon seeing that person, astonishment appeared on their faces.<br>&ldquo;Lord Asura, why are you bound?&rdquo; asked a person of the younger generation that had exited. It was Wang Guangchen.<br>&ldquo;Rather than asking me, you should ask them.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng cast his gaze to those guardians as he said those words.<br>Hearing those words, Wang Guangchen and the other people of the younger generation all turned to the guardians.<br>Upon seeing that there were people among the guardians holding whips with furious looks on their faces, Wang Guangchen and the others realized that something was wrong.<br>Wang Guangchen hurriedly asked, &ldquo;Milords, what is going on here?&rdquo;<br>A guardian explained to Wang Guangchen and the other people of the younger generations with an extremely righteous tone, &ldquo;Younger generations, perhaps you all still don&rsquo;t understand the circumstances.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This year, the World Spirit Mansion Gate was immediately closed after you entered it. You should&rsquo;ve discovered that no one entered after you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because someone used cheating means to sneak their way into it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As everyone knows, the treasures inside the World Spirit Mansion Gate are things that Lord Yuan Shu has specially prepared for the people of the younger generation like yourselves.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for that man, he snuck into the World Spirit Mansion Gate to scramble for the treasures inside against you all, even though he is a person of the older generation. Not only has he broken the rules, but his actions are also unfair to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since we&rsquo;ve captured him, he shall naturally be severely punished so as to return justice to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, this junior understands your kind intentions, but&hellip;&rdquo; said Wang Guangchen.<br>&ldquo;But what? You have a concern?&rdquo; asked that guardian.<br>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Wang Guangchen.<br>&ldquo;Speak," said that guardian.<br>&ldquo;Milord, you have captured the wrong person,&rdquo; said Wang Guangchen.<br>&ldquo;Captured the wrong person?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What nonsense are you spouting?&rdquo; The guardians all revealed looks of anger upon hearing those words. They felt that Wang Guangchen was spouting nonsense.<br>&ldquo;Milords, you all have indeed captured the wrong person. That Lord Asura is not a cheater. He&rsquo;s also a person of the younger generation,&rdquo; said Wang Guangchen.<br>Suddenly, a furious shout was heard. It was Lord White Gown. &ldquo;Impudent! What utter ridiculous nonsense are you spouting?! You dare defend someone like that?! Are you his accomplice?!&rdquo;<br>His voice was as loud as thunder, shaking the ground and mountains. Everyone could tell that he was truly enraged.<br>Met with his anger, Wang Guangchen took several steps back in fear, afraid to say any more.<br>However, surprisingly, right after Wang Guangchen shut his mouth, someone else suddenly spoke.<br>&ldquo;Milord, what Wang Guangchen said is the truth. You have indeed captured the wrong person. I can testify that Lord Asura is also a person of the younger generation, and has not cheated.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I can also testify.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I can testify too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milords, you all have truly captured the wrong person.&rdquo;<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>&hellip;<br>At that moment, the expressions of the bystanders in and outside the plaza all became complicated.<br>The reason for that was because the ones that had spoken out stating that they could testify were all the younger generations that had just exited the Spirit Formation Mansion Gate.<br>Furthermore, more and more people were echoing those words. It was simply overwhelmingly one-sided.<br>Practically none of the younger generations that came out criticized Chu Feng. Instead, they were all speaking up for him.<br>This made the crowd realize that the situation seemed to truly not be as simple as it had first appeared.<br></p></div>
