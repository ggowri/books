        <div> - Naturally Need To Be Severely Punished<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Lord&hellip; Lord Clan Chief, it&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s those animals from the Tantai Heavenly Clan. They&hellip; they&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only did they injure many of our clansmen, but they even killed thirty-seven of them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, we absolutely cannot let this matter pass.&rdquo;<br>An extremely weak voice was heard. There was even a sobbing tone when that voice spoke. It was Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa was seriously injured, and covered in blood. He did not even have the strength to stand up. He was supported by other Chu Heavenly Clansmen and brought over to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Zhengfa, sit down first. I&rsquo;ll treat your injuries.&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief immediately started treating Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s injuries. He did not provide an explicit response to his words.<br>Actually, at that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was feeling very pained.<br>Before him, his clansmen were bullied, humiliated, and killed by others. As the clan chief, it was his duty to obtain justice for his clansmen.<br>If it were people from the other powers that had killed their Chu Heavenly Clansmen, he would definitely seek justice for them.<br>However, after he learned that it was the Tantai Heavenly Clan that had done such things, he began to hesitate.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that he was cowardly. Rather, it was because the Tantai Heavenly Clan was not an ordinary power. They were truly a huge monster of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. They were ranked second among the Ten Great Heavenly Clans. They were an enormous power headed by an Utmost Exalted-level expert, a power that not even the Starfield Master Realm would dare to look down upon.<br>Even though he was a peak Exalted, he was still far inferior when compared to the Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>Even though the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was extremely furious, reason told him that he could not act blindly without thinking, that he could not have a complete falling-out with the Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>That was the reason why the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief felt so pained.<br>On the one hand, he had to shoulder the hopes of his clansmen. His clansmen were all waiting for him to obtain justice for them.<br>On the other hand, he knew very well that if he were to avenge them, what he might obtain could be the calamity of the extermination of their clan.<br>&ldquo;Who was it that dared to seriously injure the Chu Heavenly Clansmen?! Scram out here!&rdquo;<br>A furious and thunderous voice sounded. It was not at all inferior to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s furious shout from before.<br>It was Tantai Yinjian. Even though Tantai Yinjian did not leave the stone chair like the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did, he was looking at the scene below.<br>Seeing that it was his own clansmen that had committed such a major blunder, Tantai Yinjian, as a Supreme Elder of their clan, naturally could not remain indifferent.<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, we didn&rsquo;t do it on purpose. It truly is because the situation earlier was excessively chaotic, and we ended up causing those incidents by mistake.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, we truly didn&rsquo;t do it on purpose. It was truly an accident, truly not on purpose.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the people from the Tantai Heavenly Clan that had attacked the Chu Heavenly Clansmen uniformly knelt on the ground.<br>None of them dared to disobey their Supreme Elder.<br>&ldquo;What use is there in kneeling to me?&rdquo; Tantai Yinjian asked coldly.<br>Hearing those words, the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen came to an immediate realization.<br>They turned around to kneel to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Not only were they weeping bitter tears, but they were also apologizing and begging for forgiveness as if they truly regretted their actions.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Chu, we truly didn&rsquo;t do it on purpose. However, since we have already committed such a major blunder, please punish us severely.&rdquo;<br>Their voices were filled with repentance. It was as if they truly knew that they were wrong.<br>However, people with keen eyes were able to tell from a single glance that it was all a show. The Tantai Heavenly Clansmen were merely putting on a show.<br>This included Tantai Yinjian. Although he appeared furious, he did not really punish his clansmen.<br>They were only acting like that to give a way out of the difficult situation that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had found himself in.<br>Indeed, they were wrong. However, since they&rsquo;d acknowledged their mistake, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief should, logically, let things pass.<br>After all, if they were truly to have a falling-out, the one that would suffer would not be the Tantai Heavenly Clan. Instead, it would be the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>In other words, the Tantai Heavenly Clan was already giving the Chu Heavenly Clan enormous face by giving the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief a way out of this situation.<br>Otherwise, if a power like the Tantai Heavenly Clan decided to kill the Chu Heavenly clansmen, what could they possibly do about it?<br>Could the Chu Heavenly Clan declare war on the Tantai Heavenly Clan?<br>Even if the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was a peak Exalted-level expert, did the Tantai Heavenly Clan not have peak Exalted-level experts?<br>Ignoring everything else, a single Tantai Yinjian would likely not be an opponent that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief could match.<br>When even the strongest person, the clan chief, was no match for the Tantai Heavenly Clan, how would the remainder of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen be able to contend against them?<br>It was precisely because he knew the situation at hand that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had such a difficult expression on his face.<br>The bystanders were all able to tell how difficult of a situation the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief found himself in. That said, they were all able to sympathize with him.<br>They all knew that even though the Tantai Heavenly Clan was the one in the wrong, so much so that they&rsquo;d even ended up killing many Chu Heavenly Clansmen, the matter would likely have to be settled by leaving it unsettled.<br>There was nothing that could be done about it. After all, the Tantai Heavenly Clan was simply too powerful.<br>This was not only a sorrowful matter for the Chu Heavenly Clan, it was a grievance that all weaklings had to undergo. If one&rsquo;s own strength was insufficient, one would only be bullied and humiliated by others.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief sighed. He was planning to say something.<br>Everyone knew that he would definitely not truly punish the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen. Likely, he would stop looking further into the matter and settle it.<br>&ldquo;You all naturally need to be severely punished.&rdquo;<br>However, when that voice was heard, everyone&rsquo;s expressions had a huge change.<br>Could it be that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was really planning to severely punish the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen? Was he that daring?<br>No!!!<br>Soon, people discovered that something was amiss. It was not the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief that had said those words. That voice&hellip; seemed like Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, no longer were the crowd only looking shocked, but their voices were also filled with astonishment.<br>They discovered that a figure was standing behind the Chu Heavenly Clansmen. As for that person, he was Chu Feng.<br>Upon hearing that voice, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen all turned around.<br>It was then that they discovered that Chu Feng was standing behind them.<br>&ldquo;Feng&rsquo;er, is it you? Is it really you?&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others from the Chu Heavenly Clan were all wild with joy upon seeing Chu Feng. It was as if they&rsquo;d completely forgotten about the humiliation and disgrace they&rsquo;d suffered.<br>Even the weak Chu Xuanzhengfa, who was powerless to stand, broke free from the people supporting him and ran over to Chu Feng. A smile filled his deathly pale face. His previously anger-filled eyes were glistening with tears.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that the dead Chu Heavenly Clansmen were not important. Rather, to the Chu Heavenly Clan, Chu Feng was simply too important.<br>Upon discovering that Chu Feng was still alive, all the unpleasantries became unimportant.<br>To the Chu Heavenly Clan, Chu Feng being alive was the best news ever.<br></p></div>
