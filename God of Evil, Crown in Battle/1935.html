        <h1>Chapter 1934</h1>
        <div> - Break Through The Seal<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Xian Miaomiao moved through the Blood Devouring Killing Formation with a speed so fast that she looked like a ray of light.<br>In order to quickly leave this place, she had unleashed a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill-level movement martial skill.<br>That said, to use a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill for an extended period of time placed an enormous burden on her body. Right now, she was gasping for breath, and her complexion had turned pale. However, she was still moving forward persistently.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a loud explosion was heard. The space around them started to tremble, and a boundless amount of atmospheric pressure burst forth from underneath the ground. It was like a volcanic eruption. However, it was much more ferocious than a volcanic eruption.<br>That atmospheric pressure affected even Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao. Suddenly, they were unable to steady their bodies.<br>&ldquo;This!! What&rsquo;s happening?!&rdquo; When Xian Miaomiao looked down, her expression immediately changed.<br>Thick smoke was surging down below. The earth was crumbling as enormous cracks thousands of meters wide began to spread on the ground. Those cracks were so deep that they led directly underground. Looking at them, one could only see endless darkness.<br>When they looked further, Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao discovered that this phenomenon was happening everywhere that they could see. It was as if the land of the entire Blood Devouring Killing Formation was subsiding and tearing apart.<br>&ldquo;This is truly bad,&rdquo; Compared to Xian Miaomiao, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression was even more uneasy.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng did not answer Xian Miaomiao. Instead, he suddenly waved his sleeve. Then, a layer of spirit power covered both of them.<br>Chu Feng sat in the middle of the spirit formation and took out several spirit formation treasures from his Cosmos Sack. Then, he began to move his hands in rapid succession. Runes and seals were borne of his hand movements.<br>They entered the treasures, and continued until the treasures were assimilated into the spirit formation. It was only then that Chu Feng stopped.<br>When everything stopped, Chu Feng, Xian Miaomiao and Lil Red all disappeared. They were hidden in the void itself.<br>What Chu Feng had set up was a concealing formation. Not only was it capable of concealing their bodies, it was also capable of completely concealing their auras.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, could it be&hellip;&rdquo; Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s movements, Xian Miaomiao seemed to have thought of something.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s good news and bad news.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The good news is that the formation seal on this place has been broken. Thus, the pressure of this place will also disappear alongside it. As such, I am safe.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The bad news is that because the formation seal has been broken, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts that were sealed here are about to emerge,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! They managed to succeed. That damned Dark Hall!&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao started to gnash her teeth in anger. After all, the release of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts was not good news at all.<br>&ldquo;Roar, roar, roar, roar, roar~~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, roars began to sound from the cracks in the ground down below. Soon, many ferocious auras soared into the sky.<br>At that moment, black clouds filled the previously sunny and cloudless sky. The area was covered in pitch-black darkness. On the ground, other than the devastation that filled the region, only unceasing roars could be heard.<br>On the ground, huge monsters were making their way out of the enormous cracks that led underground.<br>They were enormous. Each and every one of them was hundreds of meters long. They were like small mountains.<br>They were extremely powerful. All of them gave off the auras of Martial Emperors. The weakest among them were rank one Martial Emperors. Of those that were within Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s line of sight, the strongest were rank five Martial Emperors.<br>They possessed extremely frightening appearances. Although their shapes were all different, they all seemed to possess formidable powers. Their crimson eyes were like crimson suns. Murderous intentions filled those eyes. It was as if they wanted to kill everything in their line of sight.<br>However&hellip; they would not kill their fellows. These were the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts, the ferocious beasts that had lived since the Ancient Era.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts were truly wild. After they crawled out from underground, they began to cause destruction all over the place. It was as if they were venting the anger and resentment in their hearts.<br>With a smash of their enormous claws, a huge area of land before them would cave in. The ground that was already devastated became even more ruined after their destruction.<br>If these ferocious beasts were to arrive at locations where humans and others lived, the consequences would be unimaginable.<br>&ldquo;This is extremely bad. Their numbers are greater than I expected.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng surveyed the area below. His gaze grew more and more uneasy. Not only were the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts crawling out from the enormous cracks below, the cracks themselves were spreading outward.<br>Earlier, Chu Feng had wondered where the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts were sealed. Now, he had gotten his answer. It turned out that the entire central region of the Blood Devouring Killing Formation was filled with sealed Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts.<br>Their number was simply innumerable. It was too frightening. If all of these ferocious beasts were released, it was likely even the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves would not be able to contain all of them. A calamity would soon befall the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you able to determine where we are? We need to go toward the direction we came from. The greatest number of our Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elf troops were stationed there,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao said to Chu Feng.<br>Earlier, the only thing on their minds had been to get out of the central region of the Blood Devouring Killing Formation as quickly as possible. That was why they had had Lil Red lead the way. However, as the Blood Devouring Killing Formation itself had now been destroyed, the pressure was no longer present. As such, there was no need for them to fear the pressure anymore. Therefore, it would be fine for Chu Feng to lead the way now.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Chu Feng did not hesitate. He hurriedly started to lead them in the direction of where they had come from.<br>Even though the situation was extremely bad, Chu Feng still had to protect himself and Xian Miaomiao. To quickly converge with the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; experts would be the most optimal method.<br>After all, other than the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts, there were also experts from the Dark Hall here. While his concealing formation might be able to conceal them from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts, it might not necessarily be able to conceal them from the Dark Hall&rsquo;s experts.<br>Chu Feng was giving directions, while Xian Miaomiao was the one doing the actual flying. For the sake of getting there sooner, Xian Miaomiao unleashed her Heaven Taboo Martial Skill movement technique once again. Their traveling speed became extremely fast.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>After Xian Miaomiao had traveled for some time, ear-piercing tolling began to sound from ahead. After they heard that tolling, some of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts that were running outward started to scream miserably.<br>From the direction where the tolling was coming from, many dazzling golden rays began to appear. The closer those golden rays came, the more dazzling they appeared. Before those golden rays, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts retreated in fear and began to run back toward the central region.<br>&ldquo;This is great, it&rsquo;s our Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves,&rdquo; Seeing that scene, Xian Miaomiao was overjoyed, and began to accelerate.<br>Chu Feng saw that behind the golden rays were green armored soldiers. It was indeed the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; army.<br>There were not many soldiers. From what Chu Feng could see, he could see that there were only about a thousand or so Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves.<br>However, every tenth Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elf was holding a giant bell. Those giant bells were filled with an Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura. With every toll of the giant bell, a golden ray would appear.<br>&ldquo;Is that the way Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves restrain the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts? Truly, everything has a weakness.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was able to sense that although those giant golden bells were very ear-piercing, they did not pose any threat to martial cultivators. However, to those Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts, they were deadly. If that hadn&rsquo;t been the case, those Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts would not be that scared.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng noticed that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves were coming from all directions. It was as if they had formed a containment circle to seal off the entire Blood Devouring Killing Formation. At that moment, their containment circle was growing smaller. They should be sealing off the escape of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts.<br>***The below was written by Kindhearted Bee on 6-25-2015***<br>PS:<br>This is for the brothers of the Asura Hall. However, I wish for all readers to have a look. This relates to the voting results.<br>Firstly, the Asura Hall is not limited to only the readers that entered the Asura Hall. The way I see it, all the readers that enjoy Martial God Asura are brothers of the Asura Hall. That said, I will be entering the main topic now.<br>Today is Thursday. However, I feel that the voting does not have to continue anymore.<br>The reason for that is because eighty-nine percent of the book review area&rsquo;s readers voted that I do not have to make up for the missed chapters.<br>As for my Wechat platform, ninety-three percent of the readers voted that I do not have to make up for the missed chapters.<br>[1. Bee was ~90 chapters behind due to his health problems and events where he releases a massive amount of chapters depending on what rank MGA gets on 17k every month.]<br>This overwhelming superiority is enough to show that everyone is wise and farsighted. Indeed, all you brothers are very smart.<br>Although not having to make up for missed chapters might appear to be great on me, I know that everyone knows that it is actually even more difficult for me to do.<br>If I am to not make up for the missed chapters, I will only have to make up for the remaining chapters. If I do not count the explosive releases every month based on the monthly tickets Martial God Asura receives, I will only have to release an average of thirty chapters a month. Oh how easy that would be.<br>[2. Bee removed the flower events and other additional chapter events because he was so far behind.]<br>However, if I do not need to make up for the missed chapters, then, when not counting the monthly explosive releases, I will have to write at least seventy chapters every month. Remember, that&rsquo;s every month. I truly cannot even afford to relax. In other words, each month I will have to write at least 150,000 characters. Remember, it&rsquo;s 150,000 characters.<br>However, everyone can rest assured. With this many brothers supporting me, I will definitely do my best. I have said it before, I was only able to continue writing because of your support. I am writing this book of mine for the sake of all you supporters.<br>I still remember the YY event where one of my readers managed to snatch the mic. At that time, the host asked him what he wished to ask me. He said that he had no questions and merely wanted to tell me that I do not have to care about what others say about me, that he will always support me.<br>I was truly moved when I heard those words. I was about to burst into tears. Actually&hellip; there are a lot of readers that tell me those things. Every day, when I open my messages, if ten percent of those messages are cursing me, then the other ninety percent are from my supporters.<br>To the readers that care about me: brothers, rest assured. I am not that weak. I was cursed at four years ago, and have continued to write while being cursed at. If you all are interested, you can listen to this story.<br>Four years ago, when my first book, War God Asura, just managed to obtain some achievements, I had people attack me. They said my writing was extremely bad, said that my writing was trash. When I do not write enough chapters, people complained about my moral quality, my character. When I decided to charge a fee for my book, people cursed me for scamming money.<br>If they were truly my readers, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if they cursed me. At the very least, that would mean that they liked my writing. That would mean that they, at the very least, acknowledged me. When my readers curse at me, I will not complain. That remains true even now.<br>However, I discovered at that time that that small portion of people that were cursing at me everyday with fake accounts were actually my fellow writers.<br>In fact, one even found me and demanded money from me. He said that if I didn&rsquo;t give him money, he&rsquo;d curse my writing for being bad everyday so that no one would read it.<br>As I was a newcomer back then, it was inevitable that I would be puzzled by all this. Later on, I had a senior tell me that writing web novels is also not a Pure Land. If your performance is good and you receive the support of the readers, it will be inevitable for others to be jealous of you. Without you even knowing, you&rsquo;ll have offended others. You&rsquo;ll get used to it eventually. If you&rsquo;re good, you&rsquo;ll get popular. However, if others don&rsquo;t curse you, you will never get popular.<br>He told me two things:<br>Those who are popular will have a lot of scandals.<br>Those who are not envied by others are only mediocre.<br>I remembered those two sentences and continued to persist with my writing. However, I did not persist because of those two sentences. Rather, it was because of the readers that supported me. In other words, you all, the brothers of the Asura Hall.<br>When I finished writing my first book, it was accompanied by curses and scoldings. That being said, as the first book from a new writer, War God Asura&rsquo;s performance was most definitely dazzling.<br>When my second book, that is my current book, Martial God Asura, was serialized, that group of people that cursed me also appeared.<br>Right at the first ten chapters, there were people who said that my writing was inferior to War God Asura, that it would definitely fail.<br>When I wrote several hundred thousands of characters for Martial God Asura, there were people that said that my writing was growing worse and worse, that the more I wrote, the more trash it became, that it would definitely fail.<br>And now, I have written more than four million words for Martial God Asura. Yet, I am still seeing those comments everyday.<br>However, the clicks on Martial God Asura have now surpassed three hundred million, and there are several hundred thousand readers waiting for new releases of Martial God Asura everyday.<br>If you are to say that my writing is bad, I won&rsquo;t judge. Everyone likes different things. If you don&rsquo;t like something, I cannot force you to like it.<br>However, there are over a million readers that like Martial God Asura. As a writer, that is already enough for me.<br>However, if you are to say that Martial God Asura will fail, I can only say that there&rsquo;s a problem with your eyes.<br>As for those that say that there will be no one to read Martial God Asura in the future, I can only smile at that. The reason for that is because the actual answer will make them want to cry.<br>Well then, that story I wanted to tell everyone is done. I said all these things because I wanted the readers who are concerned about me to be at ease. I will not be crushed by those that are throwing rocks at me, for I became who I am today with rocks coming at me the entire way.<br>The reason why I can persist even with the rocks being thrown my way is because I have you all supporting me the entire time.<br>Today is Thursday. It is still not Sunday. However, I have released five chapters in succession. Those were five chapters I wrote after staying up late into the night. From last night all the way till six in the morning today.<br>This are my repayment to you brothers. I did that because I care for you all. I also thank you all for caring about me.<br>The number of people cursing me will not decrease.<br>The number of people who dislike Martial God Asura will not decrease.<br>However, everyone, please believe me. The performance of Martial God Asura will get better and better.<br>The reason for that is because I possess the best brothers with me. As for those, they are all from a single place, the Asura Hall!!!<br></p></div>
