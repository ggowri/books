        <h1>Chapter 4232</h1>
        <div> - Hidden Gate<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;This time around, I&rsquo;m going to challenge brother Lu Jie,&rdquo; Chen Guang said all of a sudden.<br>Those weren't the first words he'd spoken.<br>But, that particular sentence had caught everyone&rsquo;s attention.<br>Challenge Lu Jie?<br>Everyone understood the implication of those words.<br>Only Lu Jie had managed to successfully stand atop the Talent Steps.<br>Chen Guang was most definitely implying that he wanted to challenge the Talent Steps.<br>If anyone could remain on the Talent Steps for a longer period of time than Lu Jie, it would mean that they would strike Lu Jie&rsquo;s name off and inscribe their own name onto the Ancient Compliance Castle&rsquo;s flag.<br>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s Chen Guang.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that he and Yue Yang have both managed to comprehend rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The two of them are still people of the younger generation, no? To be able to comprehend rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation at such a young age, perhaps they might really be able to challenge Lu Jie.&rdquo;<br>All the people present had turned their eyes to Chen Guang.<br>Chen Guang was already renowned throughout the Holy Light Galaxy as a genius world spiritist.<br>He was one of the most outstanding genius world spiritists of the younger generation.<br>Whilst the crowd did not believe that he would be able to successfully challenge Lu Jie, they&rsquo;d all heard about Chen Guang gaining comprehension of rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation at an age younger than a hundred, and were indeed astonished by his feat.<br>As such, the crowd felt that if Chen Guang truly planned to challenge the Talent Steps, it was not an impossible task either.<br>Hearing the crowd&rsquo;s discussions, Chen Guang became even more pleased with himself.<br>Soon, he began walking towards the Talent Steps.<br>&ldquo;Bang---&rdquo;<br>He had only taken several steps forward when a sudden bang was heard.<br>Chen Guang reacted as if he had run into something. He grabbed his nose and immediately took several steps back.<br>&ldquo;What is this?!&rdquo; he shouted angrily. He knew that whatever it was had blocked his path. But, he was unable to see anything at all.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something there?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were rather surprised by this too. In the beginning, they'd thought that Chen Guang was making a joke. Nevertheless, some people decided to check things out, and extended their hands toward the location where Chen Guang had bumped into something.<br>It was only then that they discovered that there was indeed an invisible barrier blocking their path. That barrier blocked both the route to the Compliance Mirror and the Talent Steps.<br>All of them were blocked by the invisible barrier.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s really something there. What&rsquo;s going on? Why are we unable to go over there?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all confused.<br>No matter what, they were all genius world spiritists of the younger generation.<br>Whilst their world spirit techniques might be nowhere comparable to those of the grand existences outside, they were all outstanding existences among the people of the younger generation.<br>The majority of the people present were all Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists.<br>Even for those that had grasped rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation, they were not limited to only Yuan Shu, Li Fengxue, Yu Ting, Chen Guang and Yue Yang.<br>But, no matter what sort of ability they used to examine the space in front of them, they were unable to detect any barrier.<br>It was only when they physically touched it using their hands that they realized there was an invisible barrier there.<br>That was why they were so confused and marveled.<br>What sort of barrier could actually be hidden from them?<br>&ldquo;Lord Compliance, please excuse me, but what is the meaning of this?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that there are going to be new tests? Must we pass the new tests in order to go over there?&rdquo;<br>Unable to understand the reason why, someone turned to ask Old Man Compliance.<br>This was the first time that they had encountered something like that. As such, they had no choice but to seek an answer from Old Man Compliance.<br>&ldquo;Someone has opened the Hidden Gate,&rdquo; said Old Man Compliance.<br>&ldquo;Hidden Gate?&rdquo;<br>The crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed upon hearing those words. Complicated emotions filled their eyes.<br>This was the first time they&rsquo;d heard of the &lsquo;Hidden Gate.&rsquo;<br>Even Yuan Shu revealed a look of surprise.<br>At the same time, he was secretly delighted.<br>Even though he still had no idea what that Hidden Gate was, he already had a guess as to who had opened it.<br>If anyone could open the so-called Hidden Gate, it would be Chu Feng.<br>&lsquo;I knew that brother Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t possibly be eliminated.&rsquo;<br>A joyous smile appeared on Yuan Shu&rsquo;s previously stern face.<br>Even the cold and detached Yu Ting&rsquo;s expression had relaxed somewhat. A faint smile rose on her lips.<br>&ldquo;Lord Compliance, what is this Hidden Gate?&rdquo; asked Chen Guang.<br>The others also perked up their ears in anticipation of the answer.<br>Although Old Man Compliance did not show himself, his voice sounded again, &ldquo;The Hidden Gate is located in the passage you all used to enter the Ancient Compliance Castle.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You all had only thought about how to breach the spirit formation blocking your path to enter the Ancient Compliance Castle. As such, none of you discovered the Hidden Gate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But today, someone managed to discover its existence, and then entered it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That person will fail their challenge of the Hidden Gate, or successfully enter this place to activate the Compliance Mirror. Until then, that invisible barrier will remain in place, and you all can only continue to wait here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Either that person fails their challenge or activates the Compliance Mirror? What&rsquo;s the meaning of that?&rdquo;<br>The crowd looked at each other in dismay. The shock on their faces grew even stronger.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because that person has the qualification to be the first person to activate the Compliance Mirror,&rdquo; said Old Man Compliance.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd came to a realization.<br>Regardless of who it was that had opened the Hidden Gate, their performance had surpassed that of everyone else present, and gained greater qualifications than them.<br>Until either that person failed their challenge or passed and then activated the Compliance Mirror, no one else, regardless of whether they were Chen Guang, Yue Yang, Yuan Shu, Li Fengxue, Yu Ting or anyone else, was qualified to approach the Compliance Mirror or the Talent Steps.<br>At that moment, there were people exclaiming in admiration, and people whose expressions had turned ugly.<br>This was especially true for Chen Guang. Earlier, he had been immensely proud of himself. However, his expression had sunk.<br>Earlier, he had been the person that everyone had focused their attention on.<br>But at that moment, all the radiance he had displayed had been overshadowed.<br>Like everyone else, he had been reduced to a secondary role in the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>There was only a single main character; the person who had activated the Hidden Gate.<br>&lsquo;Damn it all! Why would a bullshit Hidden Gate appear?!&rsquo; Chen Guang cursed in his heart.<br>Like Yuan Shu, Chen Guang had entered the Ancient Compliance Castle many times already.<br>Passing the test to enter the Ancient Compliance Castle was also a walk in the park for him.<br>But, he never noticed a Hidden Gate inside the passage.<br>&ldquo;Milord, who is it? Is it Lu Jie?&rdquo; someone asked all of a sudden.<br>Right after that person&rsquo;s voice left his mouth, others immediately started speaking too.<br>&ldquo;Is there even a need to ask? Who else besides Lu Jie could it be?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the entire Holy Light Galaxy, Lu Jie is the only one that&rsquo;s capable of accomplishing such a feat.&rdquo;<br>Those people all voiced the same opinion. They did not bother to even think about who it could possibly be, as they were certain that it must be Lu Jie.<br>Although the great majority of them were not people of the younger generation within a hundred years of age, they were still very young, as they were all qualified to challenge the Ancient Compliance Castle.<br>In the vast martial cultivation world, they were juniors and youngsters.<br>In the entire Holy Light Galaxy, among the younger generations within six hundred years of age, they believed that only Lu Jie would be capable of opening the Hidden Gate.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, deep in the Ancient Compliance Castle, below the Heavenly Compliance God&rsquo;s signboard, light suddenly appeared.<br>The light was seven-colored. It was gorgeous and dazzling. After the seven-colored light appeared, like seven divine dragons, the light twisted upon itself and formed a dazzling spirit formation gate.<br>Everyone&rsquo;s eyes were focused on that spirit formation gate.<br>They knew that this most likely meant that the person who had activated the Hidden Gate had successfully passed its challenge.<br>Then, there were actually people among the crowd that started cheering.<br>&ldquo;Brother Lu Jie, you&rsquo;re amazing!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Lu Jie, you&rsquo;re the strongest!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is truly unimaginable! As expected of the highest-regarded disciple of Lord Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Lu Jie, you&rsquo;ve truly broadened our horizons!&rdquo;<br>Without exception, all those cries and cheers revolved around Lu Jie&rsquo;s name.<br></p></div>
