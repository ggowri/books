        <h1>Chapter 5614: Promise of the Nine Heavens</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you going to the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith?&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I have heard about it, but I don&rsquo;t think that I can go even if I wanted to,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard yet? The Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith was postponed because not all of the top prodigies were invited. You&rsquo;re definitely one of the prodigies who wasn&rsquo;t invited. Trust me, you&rsquo;ll receive the invitation soon,&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Really? You sure are well-informed.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was surprised that Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> was aware of the details concerning Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith. Those words gave him the confidence that he would be invited to the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you wish to go?&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d want to go if given the opportunity. You don&rsquo;t want to go?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t worthy of my time, but you are a different story. If you intend to go, I&rsquo;ll head over to take a look if I have time then,&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You wish to defeat me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course, though I&rsquo;m not confident of doing so if we&rsquo;re at the same cultivation level,&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware that you held back the last time we fought. I hope that you can go all out if we ever get another opportunity to cross blows,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that he was no match for Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span>, but he was confident that it was only a matter of time before he caught up with the latter. He hoped to have a proper match with Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> then. He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of strong opponents; if anything, he thought that he would only grow stronger from fighting strong opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Very well. I shall use my full strength if the opportunity arises. However, you will have to work harder. You won&rsquo;t be a match for me at your current cultivation level,&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> replied with a gleeful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your current cultivation level?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a secret. You just have to know that I&rsquo;m powerful,&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> replied with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;ll catch up soon enough.&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I have no doubt about that. You&rsquo;ll definitely be able to do it. If your father kept you by your side, you&rsquo;d have long&hellip;&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> was halfway through his words when he realized that he had misspoken and hurriedly shut his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was too late. Chu Feng stared at him intently and asked, &ldquo;You know my father?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my master who knows him. I heard some matters concerning your father through him,&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you know where my father currently is?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t have the answer to your question.&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you know my father&rsquo;s current cultivation level then?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Brother Zhang, aren&rsquo;t we supposed to be friends? You know about my father, but you kept it a secret from me,&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to know more about his father, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t have pressured Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m keeping it a secret from you, but I really don&rsquo;t know anything. All I learned from my master is that your father is an extremely strong cultivator, but he left you to fend for yourself. Other than that, I don&rsquo;t know anything at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Frankly speaking, Brother Chu Feng, I don&rsquo;t know why your father refuses to take you with him. Someone of your talent would have grown by leaps and bounds if a powerhouse nurtured you, but your father left you to your own devices. He would regret it if a mishap happened to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Does your mother agree with your father&rsquo;s action? Speaking of which, who is your mother? I have no idea who your mother is, but I&rsquo;d guess from your talent that she&rsquo;s no ordinary person. Ah, I don&rsquo;t bear any ill intention of asking those questions. I&rsquo;m just curious.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> clarified his stance, fearing that Chu Feng would be offended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t lose his temper at this minor, so he replied with a smile, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t convenient to divulge my mother&rsquo;s identity. It&rsquo;s true that my father has left me to my </span><span>own devices, but I don&rsquo;t blame him. He has his own plans. Besides, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything about this. Shouldn&rsquo;t a man rely on himself?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I conceded that my maturity is beneath yours. I&rsquo;m in awe.&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> clasped his fist and bowed to Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You can do it too. Why don&rsquo;t you shake off your master?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a joking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Haha! There&rsquo;s no way I can do that. You also know that I like to cause trouble. I&rsquo;ll be beaten up to death if I don&rsquo;t have my master to protect me.&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> waved his hands sheepishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng burst into laughter. He thought that Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> was quite an interesting person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll take my leave first. I still have matters to attend to. I&rsquo;ll meet you at the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith if I don&rsquo;t have anything up then,&rdquo; Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;All rights. See you,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> grasped his token and left the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng did the same too. He wasn&rsquo;t immediately brought out of the Nine Realms Immortal Region but instead transported to a random location in the world where he had met </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Yijian</span><span> and </span><span>Tuoba</span><span> </span><span>Tianxue</span><span>. This location was not too far away from the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was something about the mountain that drew one in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you still able to head to that mountain?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng had already obtained the energy to temper his body and soul from the Immortal Stream, but he might stumble upon another fortuitous encounter if he could visit the mountain too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng noticed that his token was still reacting to the mountain, and that led him to deduce that he could still scale the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s the difference between this mountain and the realm we were transported </span><span>to</span><span> earlier. Chu Feng, why don&rsquo;t we take a look since we don&rsquo;t have anything up?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What a coincidence, Eggy. I was thinking the same too,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he flitted toward the mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He arrived at the mountain peak and found that there was a spirit formation gate there. A crowd was gathered around the spirit formation gate. Most likely, these people hadn&rsquo;t obtained a token and were unable to enter the spirit formation gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng had a token in hand, so he could enter the spirit formation gate without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He passed through the spirit formation gate and arrived at an even larger world than the lake realm, just that what was beneath him were trees. There were also mountains in the distance. The scenery was beautiful, but he couldn&rsquo;t sense any fortuitous encounters around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, the lake realm was the true fortuitous encounter of the Nine Realms Immortal Region. Even if there were fortuitous encounters here, the chances were that they </span><span>were inferior to that of the lake realm. That was why Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span> left straightaway without heading here&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Ey, we should have asked Zhang </span><span>Yingxiong</span><span>. He would have known where the fortuitous encounters are,&rdquo; Eggy said with a regretful tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I can find them on my own too,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he carefully assessed the situation with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he didn&rsquo;t know was that a gray-robed man was currently wandering around the realm. His robe covered his face, and he looked just like a dried corpse. He held a compass in his wrinkly hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The needle of the compass was initially still, but as soon as Chu Feng appeared in the realm, it suddenly moved and pointed in his direction. The gray-robed man immediately turned his gaze over. It was impossible to make out his facial features under the gray robe, but his killing intent was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An old and hoarse voice reminiscent of the cries of a ferocious ghost echoed, &ldquo;I finally found you.&rdquo;</span></p></div>
