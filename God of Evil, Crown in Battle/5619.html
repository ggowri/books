        <h1>Chapter 5619: New Breakthrough</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was rooted to this spot, his feet still mired in the blood of the Immortal Slaughterer&rsquo;s Number Seven. Anyone who saw him in this state would suffer the shock of their life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not because of how he looked but the terrifying killing intent he emanated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood like that for a long time, his killing intent refusing to dissipate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kacha!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shattering sound suddenly snapped Chu Feng out of his daze. It was coming from the can. Cracks had actually appeared on the surface of the incomparably resilient can.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Chu Feng tried to enter the can, only to realize that he couldn&rsquo;t do so. The formation imbued in the can had lost its effectiveness, preventing him from entering that realm anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;No&hellip; No!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng released his spirit power in an attempt to reinforce the can so as to prevent it from shattering, but the cracks on the can only </span><span>continued</span><span> to grow. It eventually shattered with a loud &lsquo;</span><span>kacha</span><span>&rsquo;, and its fragments dissipated into the surroundings as a whiff of aura, not leaving the slightest remnant at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was almost as if the can had never existed in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng crumbled into despair, looking as if the end of the world had come. Even though he couldn&rsquo;t sense </span><span>Eggy&rsquo;s</span><span> aura anymore, he was still clutching onto the sliver of hope that she might still return as long as the can was around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that the can had shattered&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glimmer of light suddenly appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s despaired eyes. He quickly constructed a formation, which exerted a suction force that eventually manifested into a sphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng held the sphere with trembling hands. He could sense </span><span>Eggy&rsquo;s</span><span> aura inside the sphere, albeit faint. This aura had only appeared after the can shattered, which was why he immediately constructed the formation out of fear that it would vanish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After collecting the aura, he proceeded to construct another formation to isolate the surroundings. He activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to check if there were still any traces of the aura that he hadn&rsquo;t collected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unlikely for him to have overlooked any traces of </span><span>Eggy&rsquo;s</span><span> aura given his sharp senses, but he wasn&rsquo;t going to leave any stone unturned lest he foil this rare opportunity to bring Eggy back. As it turned out, he had indeed collected all of </span><span>Eggy&rsquo;s</span><span> aura from the surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, the aura had begun to stabilize, allowing him to feel </span><span>Eggy&rsquo;s</span><span> life force pulsating within the sphere. Eggy was still alive, though she was on the verge of </span><span>death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng quickly took out all of the treasures he had that could enhance one&rsquo;s life force and spared no expense to construct a fusion formation. He fused those treasures into the sphere containing </span><span>Eggy&rsquo;s</span><span> aura and life force. He even expended the invaluable Life Crystal as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn&rsquo;t enough to wake Eggy up, but it did considerably stabilize her life force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Rest assured, Eggy. I&rsquo;ll definitely save you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a gentle voice as he carefully stored the sphere in his World Spirit Space, knowing that it was beneficial to </span><span>Eggy&rsquo;s</span><span> recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, he was no longer the amateur he used to be. He knew that it was possible to save Eggy, just that he didn&rsquo;t have the required treasures with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Life Crystals were potent recovery treasures, they weren&rsquo;t what Eggy needed right now. Due to that, they weren&rsquo;t too effective on her even though they did improve her condition. Nevertheless, Chu Feng still used all of his Life Crystals on her even though it was a waste of precious resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eggy&rsquo;s</span><span> life was at stake here; he had to do everything he could to save her. He wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate in the least if he needed to sacrifice himself for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After stowing away the sphere formation, Chu Feng proceeded to loot the Immortal Slaughterer&rsquo;s Number Seven&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack and treasures with a wave of his sleeves. There was a seal on the latter&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack, but he was able to decipher it with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were quite a few treasures inside the Cosmos Sack, but the only item Chu Feng was interested in was the compass. Even now, the compass was still pointing at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng tried moving the compass around his body and found that the needle was still moving around. Eventually, he confirmed that the compass&rsquo; needle was tracking his right forefinger. That led him to a deduction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he manifested a formation dagger and sliced off his right forefinger. He didn&rsquo;t scream, but a slight furrow formed on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was extremely painful, to the point that his face turned ghastly pale for a brief instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he had severed was not just his physical finger, but the soul on his physical body as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current cultivation level, he could swiftly regenerate his body even if his physical body was completely tattered. His physical body was no longer important compared to his soul. It was not to say that his soul wouldn&rsquo;t heal, but it required much more time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All it took was a brief instant for Chu Feng to heal his severed physical finger, but it would take more time for him to regenerate his soul. His face remained ghastly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swallowed two pills that hastened the recovery of the soul before picking up his severed forefinger to inspect it. Just as he had expected, the compass&rsquo; needle was indeed tracking it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It really is that fellow!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This confirmed Chu Feng&rsquo;s earlier deduction that an imprint had been left on him. </span><span>That was the reason the Immortal Slaughterer&rsquo;s Number Seven had been able to find him. The imprint was on his right forefinger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was likely left behind when he killed the disciple of the Immortal Slaughterer&rsquo;s Number Two. What caught Chu Feng by surprise was that he didn&rsquo;t expect the imprint to be so discreet that he didn&rsquo;t even notice it at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He squeezed his hand around the severed forefinger and crushed it into bits. Only then did the compass&rsquo; needle finally revert to its default position and stopped moving altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was unable to sense the imprint, but he had most definitely destroyed it now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like the Immortal Slaughterer&rsquo;s Number Seven has such an imprint formation on him,&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spent some time examining the compass, but he couldn&rsquo;t figure out what other uses it had. In the end, he stowed it away in his Cosmos Sack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following that, he activated Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Lightning Wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eggy&rsquo;s</span><span> life force had stabilized even though it was still weak, and Chu Feng knew what he needed to do to save her. Now that his mind was put at ease, he finally had some mental capacity to ponder about what had just happened to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Much to his surprise, his rank six Half-God level cultivation boasted fighting prowess comparable to that of a rank seven Half-God level cultivator, which explained why he was able to defeat the Immortal Slaughterer&rsquo;s Number Seven earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this didn&rsquo;t appear to be heaven-defying battle power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heaven-defying battle power could be tangibly felt, but that was not the case for him. On the surface, his fighting prowess corresponded to his cultivation level, rank six Half-God level, but anyone who thought that would be in for a rude shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is this the power of the Dao of Specialization?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t sure where his newfound strength had come from, but his earlier outburst of anger and sorrow seemed to be the trigger behind this unexpected breakthrough. Clearly, this breakthrough was much more significant than him raising his cultivation.</span></p></div>
