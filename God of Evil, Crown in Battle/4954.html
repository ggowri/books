        <div>: Rank Nine Dragon Transformation Sensation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Is that so? You won&rsquo;t hand over the treasure even if it spells the death of your Zhuge Clan?&rdquo; the blue-cloaked woman asked with narrowed eyes.<br>Boom!<br>Great spirit power gushed out from the blue-cloaked woman&rsquo;s body. It swiftly filled up the sky, emanating an intimidating aura that made others shudder. It was spirit power comparable to the might of a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator.<br>She was a rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist.<br>&ldquo;Rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation; she&rsquo;s just a step away from reaching God-cloak. It&rsquo;s no wonder why she&rsquo;s so confident.&rdquo;<br>Even Shengguang Buyu&rsquo;s breathing hastened upon sensing the blue-cloaked woman&rsquo;s aura. Despite being enemies, he felt a sliver of respect for her. He knew just how difficult it was to reach rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo;<br>Faced with the blue-cloaked woman&rsquo;s spirit power, the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief harrumphed coldly. He formed a series of hand seals that made his hands light up. Then, he clasped his hands together.<br>Boom!<br>The earth rattled, and an aquamarine pillar gushed into the sky reminiscent of a volcano before swiftly rushing into the body of the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. It imbued the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief in aquamarine light covered in formation runes.<br>The formation runes were beautiful, covering him like armor.<br>At the same time, his fighting prowess rose to the level equivalent to a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator.<br>The eyes of Chu Feng and the others lit up at this sight. They knew that the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had finally evoked the power of the defensive formation.<br>&ldquo;The defensive formation is actually that formidable?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei felt a sliver of fear. It was fortunate that he had refrained from making a move on the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief earlier on, or else he would have been the one to suffer. At the very least, he was certain that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to defeat the buffed Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;This must be the defensive formation set up by Zhuge Guangyao. Not bad. It looks like the treasure is indeed something extraordinary.&rdquo;<br>However, the blue-cloaked woman showed no fear at all. If anything, she only got even more excited.<br>&ldquo;Our Zhuge Clan has treated you with respect ever since you stepped in here. Even when you harmed our clan members, we still upheld our civility. We&rsquo;re willing to return Situ Qi&rsquo;s items to you, but if you wish to humiliate a hero of our Zhuge Clan, Lord Zhuge Guangyao, I&rsquo;m afraid that we can&rsquo;t let you have your way.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief turned to look at the elders beside him.<br>&ldquo;Activate the formation!&rdquo;<br>The elders quickly formed a series of hand seals. They were channeling their spirit energy to construct a formation.<br>&ldquo;Activate!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Activate!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Activate!!!&rdquo;<br>Shouts of &lsquo;activate&rsquo; could be heard all over the Zhuge Clan. They were setting up a formation within their body. Outsiders might not be able to see what was really happening, but without a doubt, the eventual formation they constructed was bound to be formidable.<br>The Zhuge Clan had finally bared its fangs!<br>This made Chu Feng see them in a different light.<br>Despite casting away their dignity earlier to tolerate everything from the Situ World Spiritist Clan, they didn&rsquo;t allow the latter to insult their ancestors. It was not that they didn&rsquo;t have a temper; they only chose to hold it in to resolve things amicably.<br>However, if one dared to touch their reverse scale, they wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to resort to violence.<br>And Zhuge Guangyao was their reverse scale.<br>&ldquo;Things are getting interesting,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei murmured in excitement.<br>This matter had nothing to do with him, but he was still excited to witness this fight.<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clan was a formidable foe, but things were not hopeless for the desperate Zhuge Clan either. It was bound to be a thrilling fight between the two.<br>&ldquo;Despite all your talks about respect, you have been gathering your men in preparation to fend against us right from the start. Hypocrites. Did you think that I didn&rsquo;t notice your movements?&rdquo; the blue-cloaked woman scoffed.<br>&ldquo;Our Zhuge Clan has no wish to cross hands with you, but we have no choice if you insist on cornering us. We can&rsquo;t allow others to sully the name of our ancestors.&rdquo;<br>As he said those words, the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief released the oppressive might of a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator toward the blue-cloaked woman.<br>The blue-cloaked woman quickly gathered her spirit power to fend against the oppressive might. She managed to deflect it, but those standing behind her were still forced to take a step back.<br>For the first time, the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was warning them.<br>He was telling them that the Zhuge Clan was no pushover.<br>However, the blue-cloaked woman didn&rsquo;t lose her nerves after experiencing the power of the defensive formation. Instead, her smile deepened.<br>&ldquo;That defensive formation of yours is quite interesting. I guess Zhuge Guangyao wasn&rsquo;t all talk. Now I&rsquo;m more curious than ever to know what the treasure he has left behind is. Stop being stubborn and hand over Zhuge Guangyao&rsquo;s treasure!&rdquo; the blue-cloaked woman said.<br>&ldquo;Even at the cost of our lives, we&rsquo;ll guard our ancestors&rsquo; honor. If you insist on proceeding ahead, our Zhuge Clan will have no choice but to drop all civility,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re willing to die for your values? It looks like you have some spunk. Very well then. You can all die now!&rdquo;<br>Murderous intent blazed in the eyes of the blue-cloaked woman as she waved her sleeves grandly.<br>Boom!<br>A tremendous gush of spirit power morphed into countless wind blades and flew toward those from the Zhuge Clan.<br>Grar!<br>In response, the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief quickly drew an Exalted Armament and swung his sword against the wind blades. A great martial power arc that spanned over ten thousand meters long swept across the air.<br>It was an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.<br>Boom!<br>The arc of martial power clashed against the wind blades made out of spirit power, creating a huge shockwave that rattled the earth. Even in the palace, Chu Feng was finding it difficult to maintain his balance.<br>After all, this was a fight between two individuals who had reached the<br>of Martial Exalted level.<br>&ldquo;How laughable. A world spiritist clan is actually using the means of a cultivator to fight against us. You&rsquo;ve truly sullied the honor of all world spiritists!&rdquo; the blue-cloaked woman mocked.<br>She swiftly formed yet another series of hand seals and launched yet another attack. This time around, multiple white dragons spawned in front of her.<br>It was the offensive formation that Situ Gouyue had constructed earlier on, but the blue-cloaked woman was able to construct it nearly instantaneously with just a wave of her hand, and the prowess far surpassed that of Situ Gouyue too.<br>This was the prowess of a rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation expert.<br></p></div>
