        <h1>Chapter 633</h1>
        <div> - Ridding Monster<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Junior Wuqing pays his respect to Senior Qiushui!&rdquo; After Ya Fei left, Chu Feng quickly turned around and saluted to Qiushui Fuyan.<br>&ldquo;I know you have things you want to say, but now, I need to first take care of this monster. It will not be late to say those words later.&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan waved her hand at Chu Feng, indicating for him and Little Fishy to stay at farther distance from Jiang Wanshi.<br>&ldquo;As you wish.&rdquo; Seeing that, Chu Feng did not dare to move slowly as he knew that Qiushui Fuyan wanted to help Yan Ruyu. So, he quickly brought Little Fishy and backed away to the side.<br>&ldquo;You wicked monster! You dare to perform abominable acts using a human&rsquo;s body and hunt them for cultivation? Today, I will bring you to justice.&rdquo; Qiushui Fuyan extended both hands and speedily moved them about to cast a technique. They were very quick, and Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t even see her movements clearly. He could only see countless blurs flash past. Her hand technique was profound, and simply unfathomable.<br>*wuaooo~~~~*<br>Seeing the disadvantageous situation, Yan Ruyu started to run around everywhere, but it was useless as the formation Qiushui Fuyan laid was really too strong. There was simply no chance for her to escape. At present, she could only bear the anguish of the formation Qiushui Fuyan laid and unceasingly cry out painfully.<br>&ldquo;Junior Wuqing, I am truly sorry to have let you suffered. But, it was my master&rsquo;s intents so I could not do anything at all.&rdquo; Just at that moment, Jiang Wanshi walked up to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side.<br>&ldquo;Senior Jiang, what exactly happened?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng puzzledly. He was really a bit confused.<br>&ldquo;Hoh, so it&rsquo;s like this. Actually, when Junior Wuqing came to the Lovers Terrace and asked to visit my master, she was there.<br>&ldquo;But, my master didn&rsquo;t want to see Junior Wuqing and even specially told me hiddenly to tell you that she wasn&rsquo;t there, and that she had gone to the Everlasting Sea of Blood to capture the monster.<br>&ldquo;And shortly after Junior Wuqing left, my master brought me to this place and was hiddenly protecting you. Back then, when you were caught by the monster, my master and I were there. At first, she wanted to make her move and save you, and also eradicate the monster along the way.<br>&ldquo;But, she didn&rsquo;t expect the monster to not kill Junior Wuqing. Seeing that there was something strange going on, she didn&rsquo;t show herself. Only until today when Ya Fei wanted to kill you was she willing to appear,&rdquo; said Jiang Wanshi, explaining.<br>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s like that.&rdquo; At that instant, Chu Feng felt rather helpless. He knew that Qiushui Fuyan didn&rsquo;t trust him and was intentionally observing him secretively. Likely, Qiushui Fuyan currently already knew that he was wearing the Transformational Mask to conceal his real face, and also knew that he was actually called Chu Feng.<br>But the thing he felt most helpless towards was that he didn&rsquo;t detect anything regarding Qiushui Fuyan&rsquo;s tracking. If he had to blame something he could only blame his own lack of strength. In front of a powerful expert, he was still too petty.<br>&ldquo;Junior Wuqing, my master does have good intentions, so I hope you won&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; advised Jiang Wanshi with a smile, as if she knew Chu Feng&rsquo;s thoughts. As she spoke, she even cast a glance at Little Fishy in Chu Feng&rsquo;s embrace. After seeing such a cute Little Fishy, she actually couldn&rsquo;t help extending her hand to touch her beautiful face. &ldquo;This little girl is truly adorable. In the future, she will definitely grow up to be an exceptional great beauty.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Pah!&rdquo; However, before Jiang Wanshi touched Little Fishy, she abruptly evaded and even opened her small mouth and spat out some spittle at Jiang Wanshi. If she didn&rsquo;t have quick reactions, that large spit would have landed on her face.<br>&ldquo;Little Fishy, don&rsquo;t be disrespectful.&rdquo; Seeing that, Chu Feng was very shocked. He never expected Little Fishy to be so impolite to others.<br>&ldquo;Hmph.&rdquo; Little Fishy disagreed with Chu Feng&rsquo;s reprimand so she raised her head and pouted, exhibiting a cute appearance of<br>you can&rsquo;t tell me what to do.<br>&ldquo;Hoh, this child is truly adorable.&rdquo; But what surprised Chu Feng was that as she faced Little Fishy&rsquo;s previous action, not only was Jiang Wanshi not angry, she even lightly chuckled as she covered her mouth. Her fondness of Little Fishy actually increased and didn&rsquo;t diminish.<br>*boom rumble rumble* But just at that moment, an explosion came from the formation Qiushui Fuyan laid.<br>Looking towards the origin of the sound, Chu Feng and Jiang Wanshi both couldn&rsquo;t help but gasp. At that very instant, the formation was filled with golden Spirit Formation chains, and those chains were tightly binding Yan Ruyu.<br>But Yan Ruyu was even resisting against such a powerful formation. Chu Feng and the others could clearly see layers and layers of boundless power opposing the golden chains.<br>However, that wasn&rsquo;t even much. Most importantly, the powerful Qiushui Fuyan actually had an expression of strain. Her forehead was full of bead-sized sweat droplets. Even her hands were lightly trembling, as if enduring some sort of pressure.<br>&ldquo;Myriad Technique Demon Execution Formation, seal!&rdquo; Suddenly, Qiushui Fuyan hands, which were casting a technique, changed from their usual pattern and she lightly yelled. The vast golden formation started to alter, becoming a small-scale cage that was rapidly shrinking. Finally, the cage became humanoid and locked Yan Ruyu inside like a coffin.<br>&ldquo;Hahahahaha! Foolish humans! To want to exorcise me is not something you can do! We are already one. To kill me is to kill her, there is no other choice. Hahahaha...&rdquo; But just at that moment, sharp and mad shouts came from the humanoid coffin. It was from the monster in Yan Ruyu&rsquo;s body.<br>*whoosh whoosh whoosh*<br>However, Qiushui Fuyan ignored the monster&rsquo;s loud yells. With one hand, she drew something in the air. A golden symbol was then formed.<br>After the golden symbol landed on top of the humanoid coffin, from an initially quivering state it calmed down, and the monster&rsquo;s shouts also vanished.<br>&ldquo;Wuqing thanks Senior for the help!&rdquo; Seeing that, Chu Feng hurriedly went forward and paid his respects to Qiushui Fuyan.<br>&ldquo;Wuqing? Aren&rsquo;t you called Chu Feng?!&rdquo; However, hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, Qiushui Fuyan lightly frowned, and a hint of displeasure flashed past.<br>Chu Feng could do nothing about that situation, thinking that indeed, his conversation with Yan Ruyu before was all heard by Qiushui Fuyan.<br>But what happened had happened, and Chu Feng could not do anything about it. He could only say with an apologetic face, &ldquo;This junior did not intend to offend, but my master gave me an order and Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t dare to betray it, so I could only walk in the Eastern Sea Region with a fake name.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hmph. Do you even need to hide it from me? Your master truly dotes on you huh?!&rdquo;Qiushui Fuyan glared at Chu Feng once again, the jealousy in her words evident, but also containing a bit of suspicion.<br>&ldquo;...&rdquo; And as he faced Qiushui Fuyan words, Chu Feng was quite speechless and didn&rsquo;t know how to respond.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to thank me. The monster in your friend&rsquo;s body is not simple at all. To kill itmeans it must be expelled from your friend&rsquo;s body.<br>&ldquo;But, it had already merged with her at an earlier time, and with my strength, I simply cannot force it to leave the body. So, I can only temporarily seal it,&rdquo; said Qiushui Fuyan.<br>&ldquo;Senior Qiushui, is my friend all right now?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng concernedly.<br></p></div>
