        <h1>Chapter 5744: Wang Qiang’s Strength</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little Fishy, Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span>, and Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> stared daggers at Qin Xuan. Even the onlookers could sense the sharp edge in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you have a grudge with Qin Xuan?&rdquo; </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng stepped forward, assessed Qin Xuan, and remarked, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we have met before, but I remember Qin Shu. We met in the Ancient Realm. He worked with the </span><span>Bluemoon</span><span> Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Zhou Dong to deal with me and Miss </span><span>Muxi</span><span>,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The </span><span>Bluemoon</span><span> Sacred Palace? Isn&rsquo;t that an unorthodox sect? Qin Shu actually worked with someone like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd narrowed their eyes. The </span><span>Bluemoon</span><span> Sacred Palace was a renowned demonic sect from the Bloodline Galaxy, second only to the Demon Morph Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not to say that the so-called orthodox sects were paragons of virtue themselves&mdash;many of them had committed heinous crimes themselves&mdash;but that didn&rsquo;t hinder them from looking down on demonic sects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Cough&hellip;&rdquo; Qin Xuan interjected with a cough. &ldquo;First and foremost, I didn&rsquo;t order my little brother Qin Shu to propose a partnership with Miss Feng Ling to deal with Chu Feng. There might be a misunderstanding here. Second, our Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect will never collude with the likes of a demonic sect, including the </span><span>Bluemoon</span><span> Sacred Palace. I suspect that Chu Feng is trying to sully our reputation,&rdquo; Qin Xuan said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the strongest junior of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect, after all. Despite his fluster, he maintained a composed and dignified appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Who did you say is sullying whose reputation? Why don&rsquo;t you say that again?&rdquo; Little Fishy pointed her finger at Qin Xuan, threatening to make a move if he dared say anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t going to admit to it after what you&rsquo;ve done? Where&rsquo;s Qin Shu? Step out!&rdquo; Feng Ling&rsquo;s smile vanished as she pushed the matter forward. She wasn&rsquo;t going to let this matter slide that easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uwa</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A figure suddenly flew across the air, crashed onto the square, and tumbled up to Chu Feng&rsquo;s feet. Chu Feng had to step down on the person to stop him from tumbling any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that person?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;His clothes&hellip; Is he from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tumbling person was covered in blood, and his face had swollen to the size of a pig&rsquo;s head. There were many footprints on his face and body, indicating that he had been put through quite a bit of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just that he was so badly pummeled that no one could recognize him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only one who recognized him was Qin Xuan, who rushed forward to hold Qin Shu.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Qin Shu, who beat you up?!&rdquo; Qin Xuan asked in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could tell that Qin Shu was severely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;D-d-d-don&rsquo;t bother asking. It&rsquo;s m-m-m-me!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A person stepped out from the white fog. The crowd didn&rsquo;t recognize the person, but they were shocked by the person&rsquo;s appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Chu Feng and Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> were overjoyed as they recognized the person to be Wang Qiang. Chu Feng rushed up to Wang Qiang and exclaimed, &ldquo;Brother, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng had been worried about Wang Qiang due to the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, so he was relieved to see the latter safe and sound. On top of that, Wang Qiang had clearly made huge advancements in his cultivation, judging from how he was able to pummel Qin Shu.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above all things, he was just happy to reunite with an old friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wang Qiang was a close buddy whom he had met in a Lower Realm, but the two of them fought together through the ranks, rising to an Ordinary Realm, followed by an Upper Realm. They had been through many tribulations together, which forged unbreakable ties between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hehe, w-w-w-who else could it be other than me? M-m-m-my good brother, l-l-let me hug you. Let&rsquo;s have a g-g-g-good talk later on!&rdquo; Wang Qiang opened his arms wide as he looked at Chu Feng with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was not a mushy person, but he didn&rsquo;t hesitate to give Wang Qiang a hug. After a quick hug, he stepped back, grabbed Wang Qiang&rsquo;s shoulder, and assessed him from head to toe. A radiant smile formed on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why are you still so skinny? Does the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion not feed you well?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Wang Qiang could answer, a furious bellow echoed from behind, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Wang Qiang? Were you the one who beat up my little brother?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Qin Xuan. He had awakened Qin Shu while Chu Feng and Wang Qiang were chatting. Qin Shu burst into tears as soon as he saw his older brother, and he pointed Wang Qiang out as the culprit who had beaten him up for an entire night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Qin Xuan tolerate this, given how much he doted on his little brother?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>So</span><span> what if he did?&rdquo; Chu Feng stepped in front of Wang Qiang, shielding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh </span><span>shoosh</span><span> </span><span>shoosh</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five figures quickly flitted forward to take Chu Feng&rsquo;s side. They were Little Fishy, Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span>, Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span>, Long Chengyu, and Feng Ling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you taking advantage of me because you outnumber me? You must think that our Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect is a pushover,&rdquo; Qin Xuan sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Brother Qin, you seem to be misunderstanding us.&rdquo; </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> walked up to Qin Xuan with a mocking smile. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for us to gang up on you. My little sister is more than enough to beat you up.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he made his way over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Gosh! Wang Qiang is also part of Chu Feng&rsquo;s group. How in the world does Chu Feng know so many people?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Who was the one who said that Chu Feng is dead meat if he dares step onto the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith? More like the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith is his turf! He has so many </span><span>connections here!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;But how did he get acquainted with so many powerhouses? No one knew he was Jie </span><span>Ranqing&rsquo;s</span><span> son until recently, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd couldn&rsquo;t understand why so many people were siding with Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Xuan frowned as well. He was not afraid of Little Fishy, but he was intimidated by </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span>. Of the entire world of cultivation, the only junior whom he was certain he couldn&rsquo;t win against was </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, we&rsquo;ll settle things with you later, but the one whom I&rsquo;m looking for right now is Wang Qiang. He beat up my little brother for no reason, and I demand justice for that. Step forward if you&rsquo;re a man, Wang Qiang!&rdquo; Qin Shu roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Try laying a finger on him. Do you think that there&rsquo;s no one in our Heavenly Body Divine Mansion?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several hundred people dressed in golden armor stepped out from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd quickly stepped aside, for they recognized these people to be prodigies from the Divine Body Heavenly Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing at the forefront of a group was a brawny man with curly hair. He was Li Tang, a famed prodigy in the world of cultivation. While his reputation wasn&rsquo;t as resounding as Qin Xuan&rsquo;s, he was no weakling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Li Tang, I have no intention of making light of your Divine Body Heavenly Mansion, but look at my little brother. He was beaten up to this state for no reason. I demand justice for this. Don&rsquo;t blame me for getting nasty on you if you dare stand in my way,&rdquo; Qin Xuan said with a forceful tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of Li Tang at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of juniors from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect also stepped forward and took their positions behind Qin Xuan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;B-b-b-brother, step aside. I-I-I&rsquo;ll settle my affairs myself,&rdquo; Wang Qiang said before leaping up to Qin Xuan. &ldquo;I-I-I-I was the one who beat up this lad! H-h-h approached me, saying that he wanted to work with me to d-d-d-deal with Brother Chu Feng. So, I-I-I beat him up! If you have an issue with that, I-I-I&rsquo;ll beat you up too!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wang Qiang looked at Qin Xuan as if he wasn&rsquo;t a threat at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You arrogant thing! I&rsquo;m not Qin Xuan if I don&rsquo;t teach you a lesson today!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to tolerate such provocation, Qin Xuan raised his palm and thrust it against Wang Qiang&rsquo;s chest. This strike harnessed his full strength as a rank six Half-God level cultivator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wang Qiang clenched his fist and counterattacked with a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bam!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two strikes clashed, and Qin Xuan was forced to retreat several steps. On the other hand, Wang Qiang stood his ground firmly, not moving in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wang Qiang&rsquo;s cultivation was also at rank six Half-God level, and it was clear that he wielded greater strength between them two!</span></p></div>
