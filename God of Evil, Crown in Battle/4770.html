        <div>: Hidden Dragon Elders Joins the Fray<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Protector Qi couldn&rsquo;t tolerate the fact that Chu Feng was actually able to control the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake, his turf. So, he quickly took out a token with a flag inscribed on it. He formed a series of hand seals, and the flag in the token swiftly enlarged to over ten meters in length.<br>There were words on the fluttering flag. There was a large &lsquo;Command&rsquo; word, followed by a smaller &lsquo;Blackwater Sixfinger Lake&rsquo; beneath.<br>This was the token used to control the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake, and typically speaking, there was no need to open the flag in order to tap into its authority. However, reverting it back to its original form would grant the protector greater control over the formation.<br>Protector Qi was unwilling to allow Chu Feng to act as he pleased on his turf, so he was intending to use his command token to close off the barrier.<br>To his horror, the token seemed to have lost its effects. He was actually unable to control the formation at all!<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what in the world did you do?&rdquo; Protector Qi growled at Chu Feng furiously.<br>&ldquo;Lord Protector, do you really not understand what&rsquo;s going on? Very well, I shall do you a favor and enlighten you. The Blackwater Sixfinger Lake is a huge formation that is linked with the Vicious Beast Hellworld. I have entered the Vicious Beast Hellworld through the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake and deciphered the formation left behind by the sect founder, allowing me to not only control the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake but to coexist symbiotically with it.<br>&ldquo;If I leave the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake will only be able to open once every five years for the disciples. However, as long as I remain here, our disciples will be able to use the powers of the lake as and when they liked. If anyone doubts my words, he&rsquo;s more than free to give it a try. It&rsquo;s possible for anyone to temper their bodies in there right now.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he began making his way into the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake.<br>Seeing this, the chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall and the other elders quickly followed suit. If this matter was true, it would truly be a huge merit under Chu Feng&rsquo;s name.<br>Boom!<br>However, before Chu Feng and the others could even get close, a dangerous aura suddenly loomed ahead of them. It formed something reminiscent of an invisible metal wall that blocked their path.<br>Protector Qi was halting them from advancing any further!<br>At some point in time, he had overtaken Chu Feng and the others in order to stop them from entering the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake. His barrier rose from the earth all the way into the sky, disallowing anyone weaker than him to pass him by.<br>Protector Qi looked at Chu Feng and the others loftily and said, &ldquo;This is the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake, not a place where you can enter and leave as you please!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Protector, your words don&rsquo;t mean anything here anymore.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng formed a series of hand seals that invoked light from the peak of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake. It darted toward Protector Qi like a rope, seeking to tie him down.<br>Protector Qi immediately noticed that something was amiss and tried to fight back, but the light rope moved at a speed faster than he could react. Before he knew it, it was already completely tied up.<br>His barrier immediately dissipated, and he lost all power to retaliate.<br>One must know that Protector Qi was no ordinary Martial Exalted level cultivator. He was definitely one of the stronger ones amongst the elders, commanding prowess greater than even the chief elder of the North Tortoise Hall.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The crowd looked at Chu Feng with a fearful gaze. Putting aside the outsiders, even those who were closer to Chu Feng were frightened by the power he was displaying.<br>If the crowd still harbored doubt if Chu Feng could really use the power of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake before, all of their doubts were dispelled at this very moment. The truth was already being shoved right in their faces.<br>Putting aside Protector Qi, not even the sectmaster would be able to tap into the power of the formation in such a manner!<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let go of Protector Qi,&rdquo; a voice suddenly commanded.<br>Following that, two figures descended from the sky. It was an old man and an old woman. Both of them had white hair and an imposing presence.<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to Lord Hidden Dragon Elders!&rdquo;<br>All of the elders and disciples immediately bowed down to greet them, for the ones standing before them were no other than Li Muzhi and his grandfather, Li Fengxian, as well as Nangong Yuliu and his grandmother, Nangong Chunyue.<br>Chu Feng quickly did the same as well.<br>To be frank, he was a little concerned with Nangong Chunyue&rsquo;s arrival. He was able to use the powers of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake as he pleased, but this was unlikely to be sufficient for him to deal with Nangong Chunyue.<br>It was not just about her position as the Hidden Dragon Elder. Nangong Chunyue hadn&rsquo;t revealed her prowess at all, but Chu Feng could already sense a dangerous aura from her. His instincts told him that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to suppress Nangong Chunyue with the prowess of the formation here.<br>It was only fortunate that Li Fengxian was here too. He seemed to have a good impression of Chu Feng, so it was unlikely that he would allow Nangong Chunyue to act as she pleased.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how dare you make a move against a protector?!&rdquo;<br>Unexpectedly, instead of speaking up for Chu Feng, Li Fengxian took the initiative to confront Chu Feng. Both his tone and gaze were incredibly hostile.<br>&ldquo;Lord Hidden Dragon Elder, I know that I shouldn&rsquo;t have shown such disrespect to Protector Qi, but I&rsquo;m afraid that Protector Qi is not worthy of my respect. During my training in the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake, Protector Qi tampered with my daoist robe, seeking to end my life. I ask you to redress my grievances!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng took out the daoist robe and passed it over to Li Fengxian.<br>&ldquo;That rat bastard Chu Feng&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Protector Qi&rsquo;s face darkened upon seeing the daoist robe, and he began cursing under his breath.<br>He did tamper with Chu Feng&rsquo;s robe, which was why he demanded the latter to return it when he stepped out of the lake earlier on. Naturally, he was intending to destroy all evidence of his misdeed.<br>Back then, Chu Feng told him that he had lost the daoist robe, but it turned out that he had hidden it instead!<br>Li Fengxian took the daoist robe and assessed it for a moment before the rage in his eyes flared. It was just that his anger was directed toward Protector Qi this time around.<br>&ldquo;Protector QI, how do you wish to explain this matter?!&rdquo; Li Fengxian bellowed.<br>&ldquo;Lord Li, I have been framed!&rdquo;<br>It went without saying that Protector Qi wouldn&rsquo;t admit to the grievous crime of harming a disciple of the sect.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only one with this daoist robe, and I can sense your aura embedded inside the daoist robe. The evidence is clear as the day, and you&rsquo;re still trying to deny it?<br>&ldquo;Very well, it looks like I&rsquo;m not enough to pressure you to speak the truth, huh? Very well, let&rsquo;s bring this matter up to the sectmaster then!&rdquo;<br>With a wave of his sleeves, Li Fengxian released a wind blade and sliced through the light rope binding Protector Qi.<br></p></div>
