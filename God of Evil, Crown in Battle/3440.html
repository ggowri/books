        <div> - Viciously Beating Up The Xu Heavenly Clansmen<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It turns out that he&rsquo;s not only weak, but he&rsquo;s actually despicable too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Grandfather, is that the husband that you&rsquo;ve found for me?&rdquo; Far away, Gong Mingyue looked to her grandfather with bitter and grude-filled eyes.<br>The Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had an embarrassed look on his face. His gaze became complicated as he looked to Chu Feng, who was being condemned by the crowd and stepped on by that Xu Heavenly Clansman.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly, loud laughter sounded.<br>The sudden laughter surprised everyone. When the crowd discovered who the person laughing was, they were completely puzzled. The reason for that was because the person who had laughed was Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng, who was being stepped on by that Xu Heavenly Clansman and mocked by the crowd, was actually laughing.<br>The crowd didn&rsquo;t understand why Chu Feng would be laughing. Furthermore, why was he laughing so&hellip; savagely?<br>He was clearly the one being stepped on. Thus, how could he have the confidence to laugh like that?<br>&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; the Xu Heavenly Clansman that was stepping on Chu Feng asked loudly.<br>That question was actually what all the other bystanders were wondering too.<br>&ldquo;If you have the ability, you&rsquo;d best beat me to death today. Otherwise&hellip; I will have you understand what it means to regret for the rest of your life.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he raised his eyes to look at the Xu Heavenly Clansman that was stepping on him. His gaze was akin to a blade, and incomparably ice-cold. Not only did it seem like it could pierce through anything, but it was also filled with killing intent. It was as if there was an endless amount of grievance contained within it.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing such a gaze, the Xu Heavenly Clansman that was stepping on Chu Feng actually trembled in fear. Not only did he immediately move the foot that he was stepping on Chu Feng with, but he even took several steps back.<br>Although he was frightened, he was unable to understand why he would be afraid of a rank one True Immortal. Thus, he became even more furious afterwards.<br>&ldquo;Did you think that I would not dare to kill you?! You&rsquo;re nothing but an ant! Killing you is akin to killing an ant for me!&rdquo;<br>Flustered with anger, not only did that Xu Heavenly Clansman shout angrily, but he also unleashed overwhelming killing intent. His killing intent mixed in with his oppressive might and swept toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That Xu Heavenly Clansman couldn&rsquo;t really be planning to kill Chu Feng, right? That&rsquo;s Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son!&rdquo;<br>Sensing the oppressive might from that Xu Heavenly Clansman, the crowd were all greatly alarmed.<br>Although Chu Feng&rsquo;s performance had thoroughly disappointed them, he was still Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son. Merely that title was enough to prove that he was an extraordinary individual.<br>If someone were to truly kill Chu Feng, it would be something very major, so much that it could cause a commotion throughout the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield!!!<br>&ldquo;Young friend, we merely have some minor conflicts. There's no need to go as far as to kill one another. If we have wronged you by our words, you can beat me up as much as you want. By all means, you must not kill Chu Feng,&rdquo; seeing that the situation was very bad, Chu Chengkong immediately started pleading for forgiveness for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, don&rsquo;t beg for forgiveness from someone like that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m someone from our Chu Heavenly Clan. I would rather die than lower my head to trash like that.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was slightly angered by Chu Chengkong&rsquo;s pleas for forgiveness.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, did you really think that I don&rsquo;t dare to kill you?&rdquo; Right at that moment, that Xu Heavenly Clansman gnashed his teeth angrily and stared fiercely at Chu Feng.<br>Faced with the increasingly intense killing intent from that Xu Heavenly Clansman, there was no trace of fear on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face. Instead, he looked very calm.<br>Chu Feng stood up and gently brushed away the dust on his body. Then, he raised his head toward that Xu Heavenly Clansman.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best kill me. Otherwise&hellip; I will definitely kill you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Motherfucker! Trash like you dare to threaten me?! Today, I&rsquo;ll have you dead!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a furious shout was heard. That Xu Heavenly Clansman was truly planning to kill Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>Immediately after that Xu Heavenly Clansman shouted furiously, a miserable scream was heard.<br>At that time, everyone felt that Chu Feng must&rsquo;ve suffered a miserable encounter.<br>&ldquo;That is?&rdquo;<br>However, the next moment, when the crowd managed to clearly see what had happened, their expressions all changed.<br>Chu Feng was still standing where he was, completely unharmed.<br>It was instead that Xu Heavenly Clansman that wanted to kill Chu Feng that was now lying before him.<br>Not only him, but all of the Xu Heavenly Clansmen were lying on the ground like dying dogs.<br>&ldquo;Those who wish to kill Chu Feng must first pass through this old man.&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the crowd were all confused, two figures suddenly descended from the sky and landed beside Chu Feng.<br>Seeing the two people that had suddenly appeared, the crowd immediately started sizing them up.<br>They knew that the ones that had saved Chu Feng must be those two people.<br>Compared to the others, when Chu Feng saw those two people, he couldn&rsquo;t help but smile.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the heavens are unwilling to let me die,&rdquo; Chu Feng sighed emotionally.<br>The reason for that was because the two people that had appeared were Wuma Shengjie and the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>It was the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief that had used his oppressive might to force all of the Xu Heavenly Clansmen to the ground.<br>At that moment, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was frowning. It could be seen that he was very angry. Naturally, his anger came from Chu Feng suffering humiliation from those trash from the Xu Heavenly Clan.<br>That said, it was not only the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief that was furious. Wuma Shengjie was also very furious.<br>She did not say anything. Instead, after landing beside Chu Feng, she directly walked over to that Xu Heavenly Clansman that had wanted to kill Chu Feng earlier, grabbed him by his hair, and lifted him up.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you want to do it yourself, or do you want me to help you?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;My grandfather is our Xu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder, Xu Zegen! If you all dare to kill me, my grandfather will definitely not spare you!&rdquo; that Xu Heavenly Clansman shouted loudly.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s actually Xu Zegen&rsquo;s grandson?! Could it be that he&rsquo;s that Xu Yuan?!&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing that Xu Heavenly Clansman&rsquo;s words, a bystander let out a cry of alarm. Evidently, that Xu Heavenly Clansman possessed some status and reputation within the Xu Heavenly Clan. It was no wonder that he dared to act so presumptuously, and planned to actually kill Chu Feng.<br>Hearing the discussions of the bystanders, that Xu Yuan became even more confident. He planned to speak again to threaten Wuma Shengjie.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right when he opened his mouth, before his words could even leave his mouth, he let out a miserable scream.<br>It was Wuma Shengjie. She had smashed her fist into the back of his head and pounded in half of his skull, causing Xu Yuan to scream miserably as he lay on his stomach.<br>However, Wuma Shengjie was not finished. She raised her leg and directly stomped on Xu Yuan&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; Blood splattered everywhere. Wuma Shengjie smashed Xu Yuan&rsquo;s head so hard that it exploded.<br>As everyone knew, once one reached True Immortal realm, one would still be alive and completely fine even if one&rsquo;s body was destroyed, should one&rsquo;s soul remain unharmed.<br>However, one would still suffer the pain of having one&rsquo;s body destroyed. That pain was even more miserable should it reach one&rsquo;s soul.<br>As everyone could tell, Wuma Shengjie was not merely hurting Xu Yuan&rsquo;s body. Her attacks had also damaged his soul. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have screamed so miserably.<br>However, as Xu Yuan&rsquo;s body was being restricted by the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s oppressive might, he was unable to recover his body after his head was destroyed by Wuma Shengjie. As such, he was unable to even scream in pain.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahh~~~&rdquo;<br>Soon, another miserable scream was heard.<br>Upon closer inspection, the crowd noticed that Xu Yuan&rsquo;s exploded head had actually recovered. Although his head had returned to an undamaged state, his face was completely distorted. It could be seen that he was in miserable pain.<br>After his head was restored, Wuma Shengjie lifted him up again. She grabbed his head with her left hand and began to swing her right hand back and forth, lashing against his cheeks.<br>&ldquo;Pa, pa, pa~~~&rdquo;<br>Firecracker-like sounds began to explode on Xu Yuan&rsquo;s face as blood splattered all over. In the blink of an eye, Xu Yuan&rsquo;s restored face was once again drenched in blood and mutilated beyond recognition.<br>However, a ray of spirit power flashed past, and his face was once again restored to normal.<br>Earlier, the crowd were confused by what had happened. But now, they were all able to witness it clearly.<br>It turned out that after that Wuma Heavenly Clansman personally battered Xu Yuan&rsquo;s face beyond recognition, he had used spirit power to restore his face to normal only so that he could ruin it again.<br>Xu Yuan was wailing and screaming nonstop. His screams were truly miserable. Not to mention Xu Yuan, even the other Xu Heavenly Clansmen had turned deathly pale with fear. Some among them even began to shiver.<br>In that sort of situation, the gazes that the crowd looked to Wuma Shengjie with became particularly hot.<br>It was not only the bystanders. Even Gong Mingyue, who was hidden in the distance had a startled look on her face.<br>&ldquo;Not only a rank six Martial Immortal, he&rsquo;s also a Snake Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist. That person&hellip; is so powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly who is he?!&rdquo;<br>Gong MIngyue, who had considered everyone to be beneath her, actually exclaimed in admiration.<br></p></div>
