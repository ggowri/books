        <h1>Chapter 3975</h1>
        <div> - Looks Of Anticipation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a commotion arose both inside and outside the spirit formation world.<br>Not only were the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s disciples completely baffled, but even the people outside the spirit formation world that knew of Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength were completely baffled.<br>Even though they already knew that that Wang Chen fellow was planning to challenge the All-heaven Sect, they had never anticipated that he would challenge them in such a direct and ruthless manner.<br>&ldquo;Courting death!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a furious roar was heard. Nangong Yifan unleashed his attack.<br>Boundless oppressive might rushed out of Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s body like invisible waves.<br>Although the oppressive might rushed straight towards Chu Feng, as the distance was simply too close, even the disciples of the All-heaven Sect were implicated in his attack.<br>All those disciples were sent flying by Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>In less serious cases, they landed on the ground after flying far away. In more serious cases, they were injured by Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>Yet, the target of the oppressive might, Chu Feng, was completely unharmed. He still stood there unmoved.<br>While that oppressive might was very powerful, it did not affect Chu Feng in the slightest.<br>Instead, it was Beiyang Luo who Chu Feng held in his hand that looked even more miserable.<br>Even though his neck had been crushed by Chu Feng, it was merely a superficial wound for someone of his cultivation.<br>At their level of cultivation, even if their bodies were completely destroyed, they would still be able to instantly restore them.<br>As such, Chu Feng&rsquo;s behavior was only very threatening, but did not actually cause any major injuries to Beiyang Luo.<br>However, Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s oppressive might was aimed directly at Chu Feng. Furthermore, it exploded on Chu Feng. As such, it was inevitable that Beiyang Luo would be implicated.<br>Beiyang Luo not only had a pained expression on his face, but he also started vomiting blood by the mouthful. Even his aura became much weaker.<br>Although he had been injured by Chu Feng earlier, his injuries were only superficial.<br>However now, even his soul had been injured.<br>That said, his current state of injury was not caused by Chu Feng. Instead, it had been caused by Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;Exactly how enormous of a grievance do the two of you have for you to want to kill him?&rdquo; Chu Feng said mockingly.<br>&ldquo;This guy!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He concealed his strength?!&rdquo;<br>Nangong Yifan was so enraged by Chu Feng that his expression changed. However, more than being enraged, he was shocked.<br>Chu Feng had unleashed his aura when he defeated Beiyang Luo.<br>The aura he'd unleashed was that of a rank two Exalted.<br>That was the reason why Nangong Yifan was surprised.<br>Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s aura had grown stronger when he had attacked Chu Feng.<br>He had activated his Divine Power and increased his cultivation to rank three Exalted.<br>Yet, even with that, he was actually unable to cause Chu Feng harm.<br>This made Nangong Yifan realize that his opponent&rsquo;s cultivation was not simply that of a rank two Exalted.<br>It was very possible that his opponent had some sort of special power.<br>That said, Nangong Yifan did not bother with superfluous words. Light began to radiate from his body. Then, his cultivation increased again.<br>From rank three Exalted, he became a rank four Exalted.<br>Nangong Yifan had activated the All-heaven Buddha Body, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s Clan Protection Mysterious Technique.<br>After increasing his cultivation again, Nangong Yifan planned to attack Chu Feng again.<br>However, to the crowd&rsquo;s surprise, Chu Feng suddenly spoke, &ldquo;You should unleash all of your abilities at once.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With only that level of strength, you won&rsquo;t be able to defeat me.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he suddenly sighed. &ldquo;Oh, I remember now. That treasure of yours seemed to only be able to be used once within a certain period of time. You seem to have already used it earlier, that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re only able to increase your cultivation by two levels.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah, this is boring then. How exactly are you supposed to contend against me?&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng shook his head in disappointment.<br>&ldquo;Exactly who are you?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s expression became stern.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that he started fearing Chu Feng. Rather, he suddenly felt that the person before him seemed somewhat familiar.<br>Yet, he didn&rsquo;t know that person at all.<br>It was clearly the first time he'd met that person. They were simply strangers.<br>&ldquo;Who I am is not important. What&rsquo;s important is that you are simply no match for me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Huuu~~~&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, the surrounding air started to oscillate. It was oppressive might.<br>Chu Feng had unleashed his oppressive might.<br>His oppressive might swept forth, and forced even Nangong Yifan to take multiple steps back.<br>The reason for that was because the oppressive might Chu Feng unleashed was that of a rank five Exalted.<br>&ldquo;His cultivation is actually that of a rank five Exalted?!&rdquo;<br>The expressions of the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s disciples became marvelous.<br>Especially Beiyang Luo. He finally realized why Chu Feng had been able to defeat him so easily.<br>He had originally thought that he had been careless, and missed a decisive moment. Because of that, he felt unreconciled about his defeat.<br>It was only then that he realized that even if he were to fight the man before him again, he would still be absolutely no match for him..<br>After all, no matter how many abilities he unleashed, he would not be able to increase his cultivation to rank five Exalted.<br>At the same time, the spectators outside all turned their gazes to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, he is protected by a concealment treasure. Otherwise, how could we not be able to tell what sort of ability he used to increase his cultivation?&rdquo;<br>When they saw Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation increase to rank five Exalted again, yet still show no signs of change in his appearance, the crowd became even more certain of their previous guess.<br>They believed that Chu Feng had some sort of concealment treasure on him that was able to conceal the abilities he used to increase his cultivation.<br>Otherwise, it was simply inexplicable as to why he would possess such mighty battle power.<br>&ldquo;What will Nangong Yifan do now?&rdquo;<br>While they were astonished by Chu Feng&rsquo;s ability, the crowd also looked to Nangong Yifan.<br>When Nangong Yifan had fought Shentu Haoli, he had been able to increase his cultivation from rank two Exalted to rank five Exalted.<br>Apart from the Divine Power he was born with and the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s clan protection mysterious technique All-heaven Buddha Body, Nangong Yifan had also relied on a treasure to increase his cultivation.<br>That treasure was called the Scarletflame Soularmor.<br>Unfortunately, the Scarletflame Soularmor could only be used for a limited period of time.<br>After using the Scarletflame Soularmor, it could not be used again within a short period of time.<br>When Nangong Yifan had fought Shentu Haoli earlier, he had already used the power of the Scarletflame Soularmor.<br>Even though it had been some time since he first used it, it seemed to still not be enough time for him to be able to use it again.<br>It was true that Nangong Yifan was unable to use the power of the Scarletflame Soularmor at that moment<br>Unable to use it, Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s cultivation would be limited to only rank four Exalted.<br>Thus, how was he supposed to contend against the rank five Exalted Wang Chen?<br>When even the spectators were worried about Nangong Yifan, the elders of the All-heaven Sect were naturally even more worried.<br>However, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster continued to have a confident expression. It was as if everything was still within his grasp.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Nangong Yifan chuckled coldly.<br>When he did that, the crowd all revealed joyous looks.<br>To be able to laugh with such contempt even though one&rsquo;s opponent had a cultivation a level higher, the crowd suspected that Nangong Yifan must have more abilities he could use.<br>As such, looks of anticipation filled the crowd&rsquo;s faces.<br></p></div>
