        <div> - Being Taken Advantage Of<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Compared to Long Daozhi and Chu Feng, the others were not that surprised.<br>After all, amongst all of them present, the Nine Principles Dragon Sect was the strongest. They were indeed the people with the greatest possibility of obtaining a Dragon Vein Source Stone.<br>That said, this result made the people that had been ridiculing the people from Ancestral Martial Dragon City and Long Daozhi even more pleased with themselves.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, they&rsquo;ve gone mad imagining that they&rsquo;ll be able to return to the Dragon Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say that a bunch of trash like them were only able to enter the Endless Abyss by pure luck, and couldn&rsquo;t possibly obtain a Dragon Vein Source Stone?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is truly hilarious.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the people that were feeling worried earlier began to mock Long Daozhi and the people from Ancestral Martial Dragon City without holding anything back.<br>However, Long Daozhi was unable to hear any of those malicious words.<br>Only a single thing was present in his mind right now.<br>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;I was clearly the one who handed Lord Tonghe the Dragon Vein Source Stone. Why would the Nine Principles Dragon Sect be the ones to return to the Dragon Clan?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;This shouldn&rsquo;t be the case. This shouldn&rsquo;t be the case.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Did they make a mistake?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Perhaps this was a mistake.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord! Lord Tonghe!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is wrong! This is wrong!&rdquo;<br>With his thoughts reaching this point, Long Daozhi soared into the sky and flew over to Lord Tonghe.<br>He wanted to receive an explanation.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>But, before he could even reach Lord Tonghe, an oppressive might was released from the war chariot. That oppressive might stopped Long Daozhi in his tracks.<br>The oppressive might was so powerful that not even Long Daozhi could pass through it.<br>Two figures then flew down from the war chariot.<br>They were people from the Dragon Clan.<br>Not only did they arrive before Long Daozhi, they even took out their weapons and pressed them against his neck.<br>&ldquo;Someone of your status is not qualified to approach Lord Tonghe.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Step down immediately. Else, we&rsquo;ll take your life,&rdquo; said those two Dragon Clansmen fiercely.<br>Lord Tonghe also took a glance at Long Daozhi. However, his gaze was filled with apathy.<br>It was like he simply did not know him at all.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng realized that they had indeed been scammed.<br>However, the person that had scammed them was none other than Lord Tonghe.<br>With this, everything made sense.<br>Lord Tonghe had deliberately received Chu Feng and Long Daozhi in private, and had retrieved the Dragon Vein Source Stone from them.<br>With this, apart from him, no one could prove that the Dragon Vein Source Stone had been obtained by Long Daozhi.<br>Lord Tonghe had then given the qualification to return to the Dragon Clan to the Nine Principles Dragon Sect.<br>Likely, it was because the Nine Principles Dragon Sect had given him benefits. Or perhaps they possessed an extraordinary relationship to begin with.<br>After all, Long Xiao and his grandfather had told Chu Feng that the Nine Principles Dragon Sect had an extraordinary relationship with the Dragon Clan.<br>Chu Feng and Long Daozhi had been taken advantage of.<br>Realizing all this, Chu Feng immediately sent a voice transmission to Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Senior Long, forget about it. Don&rsquo;t argue with them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Dragon Vein Source Stone is in that Tonghe&rsquo;s possession now. Your words are without proof. No matter what you say now, no one will believe you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This Dragon Clan is simply too despicable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A Dragon Clan this despicable is simply unworthy for senior to do all this,&rdquo; Chu Feng urged Long Daozhi.<br>As the Dragon Clan was simply too despotic, and Long Daozhi was incapable of proving that he had given the Dragon Vein Source Stone to Lord Tonghe, it would be impossible for them to obtain an explanation for what was happening. Instead, they would only be asking for trouble by dragging this on.<br>However, Long Daozhi did not step down. At that moment, he had a look of grievance on his face. Tears were even flowing from his eyes. He was unable to accept this sort of ending.<br>After all, returning to the Dragon Clan was his lifelong dream.<br>Because of that, Long Daozhi looked to Lord Tonghe, who stood aloof in the sky, and said, &ldquo;Lord Tonghe, this is wrong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Dragon Vein Source Stone was clearly handed to you by me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t it be my Ancestral Martial Dragon City that returns to the Dragon Clan? Why would it be the Nine Principles Dragon Sect?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could there be some sort of mistake?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Tonghe, could you have announced this wrongly?&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi asked in succession.<br>He was still clutching to a strand of hope.<br>Mistake?<br>Oh how great it would be if that was truly the case.<br>Unfortunately, the outcome wasn&rsquo;t that.<br>&ldquo;He was the one who handed over the Dragon Vein Source Stone?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Has that man gone mad?&rdquo;<br>An enormous commotion had risen from below.<br>Soon, hoots of laughter sounded in succession.<br>When Long Daozhi mentioned to his clansmen that they had obtained a Dragon Vein Source Stone, it had only been heard by the people nearby.<br>However, his words to Lord Tonghe had been heard by everyone present.<br>However, practically no one believed Long Daozhi. They all felt that he was simply crazy and raving madly.<br>The crowd felt that Long Daozhi did not possess the ability to retrieve a Dragon Vein Source Stone.<br>Thus, like the people earlier, they also believed that Long Daozhi had gone mad with how badly he wanted to return to the Dragon Clan.<br>Long Daozhi became an object of ridicule in the crowd&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;I can understand your desire to return to the Dragon Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you need real skills to be able to return. Being delusional will forever make it impossible for you to return to the Dragon Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Step down. Do not continue to make an exhibition of yourself,&rdquo; said Lord Tonghe.<br>His words had confirmed Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess.<br>He had done this on purpose. All of it had been done on purpose.<br>Everything had been decided from the very start.<br>It was not only Long Daozhi.<br>Regardless of who had retrieved the Dragon Vein Source Stones, they would have suffered the same outcome as Long Daozhi.<br>Lord Tonghe had decided on the outcome from the start.<br>The Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s return to the Dragon Clan had been predetermined.<br>Unless no one retrieved a Dragon Vein Source Stone, regardless of who it might be that retrieved the Dragon Vein Source Stones, they would all be working for the Nine Principles Dragon Sect&rsquo;s benefits.<br>Long Daozhi was no fool. How could he not understand this?<br>However, he was unwilling to accept it. Thus, he spoke again.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I clearly personally handed the Dragon Vein Source Stone to you. Don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Lord Tonghe&rsquo;s gaze turned hostile.<br>&ldquo;Are you implying that I took your Dragon Vein Source Stone, yet decided to hand the credit to the Nine Principles Dragon Sect?&rdquo; Lord Tonghe asked with a stern voice.<br>Everyone could hear the hostility and anger in his voice.<br>It was no longer only Chu Feng that was sending voice transmissions to Long Daozhi.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others from Ancestral Martial Dragon City were also sending Long Daozhi voice transmissions and trying to dissuade him.<br>They all knew that Long Daozhi shouldn&rsquo;t continue to speak.<br>Even if what he said was the truth, he must not continue.<br>Else, he would bring a disaster upon himself.<br>How could Long Daozhi not know that?<br>Because of that, he also hesitated.<br>He was clenching his fists in his sleeves. He clenched them so hard that they were cracking.<br>In the end, a look of determination appeared in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Milord, this subordinate wouldn&rsquo;t dare fault Milord.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that the Dragon Vein Source Stone was indeed found by this subordinate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This subordinate truly wishes to return to the Dragon Clan. This subordinate had also achieved the requirements for the return.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I hope that Milord can be fair and impartial, and present this subordinate with justification.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Long Daozhi knelt in midair.<br>&ldquo;What sort of justification would this old man have to give to trash like you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Scram!&rdquo;<br>Lord Tonghe shouted furiously.<br>At the same moment he pointed his finger at Long Daozhi.<br>Immediately, a beam of light shot forth. It was a martial power sword.<br>The flying sword ripped through the air and shot straight at Long Daozhi.<br>The speed of that martial power sword was so fast that Chu Feng and the others, with their cultivations, were simply unable to see it clearly.<br>By the time Chu Feng and the others reacted to what had happened, Long Daozhi&rsquo;s body had already been pierced by it.<br>Furthermore, he had actually been pierced in his dantian.<br></p></div>
