        <div>: Powerful Enemy<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Oh? Do you have a hand prepared? Give up, the formation I have here is known as the Nine Tigers Immortal Encirclement Formation. Even a prodigy like me requires seven days to construct it. You should know how formidable it is from that.<br>&ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;re a rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist, there&rsquo;s no way you can break out of this formation,&rdquo; Jiang Kongping said confidently.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit as much that your formation is formidable. Indeed, it would be difficult for me to overcome it with my current level of spirit power. However, I have never said that I only have my spirit power to fall back on,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? Are you carrying treasures on you? Take it out then. I don&rsquo;t believe that you would have any treasures that can overcome my Nine Tigers Immortal Encirclement Formation,&rdquo; Jiang Kongping replied.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any treasures on me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Then what are you yapping about?&rdquo; Jiang Kongping snapped.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying that other than being a world spiritist, I&rsquo;m a cultivator as well,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Unexpectedly, Jiang Kongping burst into laughter after hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;I was still wondering what kind of incredible means you wield that can overcome my Nine Tigers Immortal Encirclement Formation, but it turns out that you&rsquo;re merely putting on a brave front. Of course I know that you&rsquo;re a cultivator! I even know your cultivation level at that.<br>&ldquo;From the moment you stepped in here, I was able to sense your cultivation level through my Nine Tigers Immortal Encirclement Formation. You&rsquo;re just a mere rank four Martial Exalted level cultivator. How do you expect to overcome my formation with that?&rdquo; Jiang Kongping said.<br>&ldquo;My cultivation is indeed at rank four Martial Exalted level, but you&rsquo;ll be sorely mistaken if you think that&rsquo;s my limit.&rdquo;<br>Right after Chu Feng said those words, lightning began crackling around him. The Lightning Mark appeared on his forehead, and a glorious Lightning Armor manifested around his body. Following that, his Divine Power also revealed its prowess.<br>The avatars of the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise began circling around Chu Feng.<br>That very instant, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation rose all the way to rank seven Martial Exalted level.<br>&ldquo;Woah, the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique and Divine Power. You actually grasped both of them at once? You&rsquo;re more talented than I thought!&rdquo;<br>Jiang Kongping was surprised by Chu Feng&rsquo;s massive power-up, but he soon narrowed his eyes sharply.<br>&ldquo;But this should be your limit, isn&rsquo;t it? You&rsquo;re impressive to have been able to raise your cultivation level by three ranks, but what&rsquo;s the difference between a rank seven Martial Exalted level cultivator and a rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritist? You still won&rsquo;t be able to break my Nine Tigers Immortal Encirclement Formation,&rdquo; Jiang Kongping said.<br>&ldquo;Is that what you think? Allow me to open your eyes today then.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he took out his Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword.<br>Tzzz!<br>A deafening crackling noise echoed within the room, and a powerful aura rippled forth from Chu Feng. It was so powerful that Jiang Kongping hurriedly retreated several steps.<br>&ldquo;What the hell is that?&rdquo;<br>For the first time, fear surfaced in Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Tzzz!<br>Chu Feng raised the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword up high and swung it down, unleashing the lightning crackling on its surface.<br>Boom!<br>A lightning arc surged forth, destroying everything in its path. Within moments, the Nine Tigers Immortal Encirclement Formation, which had taken Jiang Kongping seven days to construct, was utterly destroyed.<br>At the same time, Jiang Kongping sustained severe injuries. He collapsed to the ground, unable to move at all.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s lightning arc wasn&rsquo;t directed toward Jiang Kongping, but the shockwave was more than enough to inflict grievous harm upon him.<br>After all, this was no ordinary lightning arc. The power it harnessed was more than enough to overcome the difference of a single cultivation rank. It was one of the strongest means that Chu Feng wielded at the moment, the First Slash of the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes.<br>First Slash, Heavenly Lightning Appearance!<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t capture Jiang Kongping right after defeating the latter. Even though he was still standing upright, looking unfazed, he was suffering a horrible backlash that rendered him utterly powerless.<br>To make things worse, the backlash he was suffering at the moment was worse than before. It was to the extent that he dared not move in the least, fearing that it would worsen his condition.<br>It took a while before he was able to suppress the pain with his sheer willpower. The first thing he did was to hurriedly retrieve a huge bunch of pills from his Cosmos Sack.<br>These pills were potent and couldn&rsquo;t be eaten simultaneously, or else they could inflict irrecoverable damage to a cultivator&rsquo;s power. However, Chu Feng swallowed all of them at once.<br>He had no other choice, This was the only way for him to curb the backlash.<br>He let out a long sigh of relief after swallowing the pills, but even so, his face remained pale and his whole body was drenched in sweat.<br>&ldquo;Executing that move appears to have taken a huge toll on you,&rdquo; a familiar voice suddenly echoed.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes widened in shock upon hearing that voice, for the voice didn&rsquo;t come from Jiang Kongping. He quickly turned around and saw another person standing by the doorway.<br>It was someone he had met before. It was the black-robed man who saved the woman on the street earlier.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t too surprised to see the black-robed man meddling in this matter. He had deduced earlier on that the black-robed man was a member of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. Given so, it was understandable why the latter was stepping in to help Jiang Kongping.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you can&rsquo;t take that man with you. You&rsquo;ll have to stay here as well,&rdquo; the black-robed man said.<br>&ldquo;You recognize me? Who are you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>The black-robed man&rsquo;s words made him doubt his own guess as he didn&rsquo;t think that the members of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect would know who he was.<br>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who I am. I don&rsquo;t wish to hurt you, so I hope that you can surrender without fighting back.&rdquo;<br>The black-robed man slowly raised his hand before abruptly opening up his right hand.<br>Shoosh.<br>A black net shot out from his palm.<br>It was a martial skill, but it was no ordinary martial skill. There was a sinister feeling to it that felt surprisingly familiar to Chu Feng, but he was unable to figure out right away where this feeling of familiarity was coming from.<br>What shocked Chu Feng the most was that even though the black-robed man was only at rank five Martial Exalted level, the black net harnessed energy comparable to that of a rank seven Martial Exalted level.<br>In other words, the black-robed man had a Heaven-defying battle power of two cultivation levels! He was much stronger than Chu Feng had expected.<br></p></div>
