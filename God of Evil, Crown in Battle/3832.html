        <h1>Chapter 3831</h1>
        <div> - The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Movement<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Master?&rdquo;<br>Hearing Yuan Shu&rsquo;s words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed. He seemed to have realized something.<br>&ldquo;Haha. Brother Chu Feng, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly have thought that I am the close friend of that Senior Ox-nose, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re mistaken. Senior Ox-nose&rsquo;s close friend is my master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Many of the spirit formations in this place have been set up by my master," said Yuan Shu.<br>Then, Yuan Shu began to roughly inform Chu Feng about the course of events.<br>Yuan Shu&rsquo;s master was named Tang Chen. He was known as Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>That Grandmaster Tang Chen was an outstandingly renowned individual in the entire Holy Light Galaxy.<br>Many of the spirit formations on the Seven Suns Mountain Range were the works of Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>That said, Grandmaster Tang Chen had only secluded himself there. No one knew that he was there except for Yuan Shu.<br>If Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t been sent by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Yuan Shu wouldn&rsquo;t have mentioned this matter to him.<br>After all, Grandmaster Tang Chen was simply too renowned. If others were to know that he was staying there in seclusion, it was likely that not only would powers from all over the All-heaven Starfield come to pay him a visit, but even the colossi from the entire Holy Light Galaxy and various other grand experts would come to the Seven Suns Mountain Range.<br>After hearing those things from Yuan Shu, Chu Feng gained a new opinion of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>He'd already known that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was very powerful. However, he had not expected him to be that powerful.<br>Since Grandmaster Tang Chen was a grand existence whose name could shake the entire Holy Light Galaxy, then the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, as Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s old friend, most definitely possessed strength and status that could not be looked down on.<br>&ldquo;Brother Yuan Shu, since you&rsquo;re only a couple years older than me, I will not bother with formality. From today on, we shall address each other as brother. Since you&rsquo;re older than me, you shall be my elder brother,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Yuan Shu.<br>Chu Feng had learned that Yuan Shu was only a little over five hundred years old.<br>He was much younger than Zhang Duotuo and those other old freaks.<br>The gambling agreement between the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and Grandmaster Tang Chen was to each nurture an outstanding disciple, and then send their disciples to breach a spirit formation from the other. The disciple that won would be the victor.<br>Judging from things, Yuan Shu should be the disciple selected and nurtured by Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>Although Yuan Shu was much older than Chu Feng, his cultivation and world spirit techniques both qualified him as a rare genius.<br>Judging by the agreement between the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and Grandmaster Tang Chen, Yuan Shu should be Chu Feng&rsquo;s opponent.<br>That said, Chu Feng had a very good impression of Yuan Shu because Yuan Shu was an honest and upright fellow.<br>Thus, Chu Feng did not hold any enmity toward Yuan Shu. Instead, he was very fond of him. That was why he was willing to address Yuan Shu as brother.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I am not only a couple years older than you, I&rsquo;m five hundred years older than you," corrected Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Judging by the ages of martial cultivators, you&rsquo;re only a little older,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Haha, that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; Yuan Shu laughed heartily.<br>&ldquo;In that case, brother Yuan Shu, do you know where the spirit formation set up by Senior Tang Chen is located?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng still remembered his purpose in coming. Thus, he wanted to quickly breach that spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;I also do not know where that spirit formation is located. Only my master knows.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, my master is currently not in the Seven Suns Mountain Range,&rdquo; said Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;In that case, do you know where Senior Tang Chen went, and roughly when he will return?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;When my master left, he said that there would be unrest in the Reincarnation Upper Realm in the coming days, and he would have to leave to handle some matters. He told me to wait for him in the Seven Suns Mountain Range and to not leave until he comes back.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for when my master will return, he did not say.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Yuan Shu suddenly looked to Chu Feng. &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, if you don&rsquo;t have any other important matters, it&rsquo;s better that you stay in the Seven Suns Mountain Range.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the Seven Suns Mountain Range are the grand formations set up by my master. If something major truly happens, those spirit formations will be able to protect you.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng realized that the situation was not simple.<br>No matter what, Yuan Shu was an Utmost Exalted-level cultivator.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng suspected that Yuan Shu was most definitely not only a rank one Utmost Exalted.<br>It was very likely that he was a rank two Utmost Exalted, or even a rank three Utmost Exalted.<br>His cultivation was extremely powerful.<br>However, even for someone as strong as him, his master still wanted him to stay in the Seven Suns Mountain Range. From this, it could be understood that the unrest his master spoke of was not something ordinary.<br>&ldquo;Brother Yuan Shu, could it be that some sort of extremely powerful evildoer has arrived in the Reincarnation Upper Realm?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, there are some things that cannot be revealed. However, since it&rsquo;s you, I will not conceal things from you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The unrest my master spoke of is not an incident caused by the cultivators of the present age.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead, it&rsquo;s a creature from the Ancient Era," Yuan Shu said to Chu Feng with a serious expression.<br>&ldquo;A creature from the Ancient Era?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed upon hearing those words. He hurriedly asked, &ldquo;Exactly what is going on?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng must&rsquo;ve heard about the matters of the Ancient Era too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The cultivators from the Ancient Era were all extremely powerful. However, for some reason, they all suddenly disappeared.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, there is a blank and empty period in the river of martial cultivation history.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was only later on that we, the cultivators of the present era, appeared.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though our current martial cultivation path has reached the pinnacle with the efforts of our various seniors, our treasures, weapons, mysterious techniques and martial skills all seem to have a certain amount of disparity from those left behind by the seniors of the Ancient Era.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, many people feel that the martial cultivators from the Ancient Era were stronger than us, the martial cultivators of the present era.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, no one knows why the cultivators from the Ancient Era disappeared all of a sudden, and left this blank space in the martial cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, although the cultivators from the Ancient Era have disappeared, the creatures and living organisms from the Ancient Era still remain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The great majority of them are hidden deep underground. It&rsquo;s like they are existences from a different world than us, each living our respective lives.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Deep under the Reincarnation Upper Realm are hidden organisms from the Ancient Era.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Originally, everything was fine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, in recent days, those Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms have grown slightly restless.&rdquo;<br>As Yuan Shu said those words, a look of worry appeared in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Could it be, the organisms from the Ancient Era want to return to this world to compete against us?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still impossible to determine what their aim is. However, one thing can be certain -- they seem to possess no goodwill toward us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would be great if they don&rsquo;t come out. However, if they do, it will definitely not be a good thing,&rdquo; said Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Sssss~~~&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.<br>Even though he had long suspected that the unrest Tang Chen spoke of was remarkable, he had not expected for it to be so much more serious than he had imagined.<br>Chu Feng had already experienced the so-called Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.<br>Back then, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts had swept out from beneath the earth of the Holy Land of Martialism. They were extremely fierce and powerful.<br>However, those were only Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms in the Reincarnation Upper Realm were most definitely even more powerful.<br>Otherwise, someone like Yuan Shu&rsquo;s master, Grandmaster Tang Chen, wouldn&rsquo;t possibly pay so much attention to them.<br>One must know that Grandmaster Tang Chen was an existence renowned throughout the entire Holy Light Galaxy.<br>It was very possible that he was a grand existence that stood at the apex of the entire Holy Light Galaxy.<br>For an existence like that to pay such importance to this matter, it was very possible that this was something that could change the fate of the entire Holy Light Galaxy.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what happened in the Ancient Era?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be, it&rsquo;s the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms that wiped out the Ancient Era&rsquo;s cultivators?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now, they&rsquo;ve regrouped and strengthened themselves, and are planning to wipe us out again?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, if that&rsquo;s the case, why must they wait till now? What is their purpose for doing this?&rdquo;<br>All sorts of questions filled Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind.<br>He didn&rsquo;t even remember how many times he had guessed about what had happened in the Ancient Era now.<br>However, without exception, he was still unable to find an answer.<br>The matters of the Ancient Era remained a mystery. Not to mention Chu Feng, it seemed like the others, were also unable to answer them.<br></p></div>
