        <div> - The Situation Turning Bad<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Is your father the strongest person in your Tang Family?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;My father is a rank seven Half Martial Ancestor. He is indeed the strongest person in our Tang Family,&rdquo; Tang Ying said.<br>&ldquo;Your father is the strongest person in your Tang Family. Yet, he was injured from the sneak attack. Thus, why did the Cao Family not seize this opportunity to attack your Tang Family? Why would they give your father time to heal his injuries?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in a very puzzled manner.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my father&rsquo;s good friend. Perhaps his conscience got to him after he injured my father and was unable to continue.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was him who pleaded to the Cao Family to spare my father. Furthermore, he also requested for time for my father to heal his injuries. Else, he declared that he would fight for our Tang Family instead.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, should the Tang Family present my father time to heal his injuries, he would no longer involve himself in this matter,&rdquo; Tang Ying said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually this melodramatic?&rdquo; Black lines ran down Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s very melodramatic. However, it remains that if it wasn&rsquo;t for my father&rsquo;s good friend, my father would&rsquo;ve already been killed by the Cao Family that day,&rdquo; Tang Ying said.<br>&ldquo;This thing is interesting. It is truly quite a drama,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he asked, &ldquo;Then, what is the length of time the Cao Family gave your father to heal his injuries?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We still have another month,&rdquo; Tang Ying said.<br>&ldquo;Then there should be enough time,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Enough time for what?&rdquo; Tang Ying asked.<br>&ldquo;I must go and eliminate that demonic woman first. However, since I&rsquo;ve promised to be your bodyguard for a month, I must protect you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is especially true when your Tang Family is faced with your great enemy. At that time, you should be in greater danger. As your bodyguard, how can I not be by your side?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if it&rsquo;s a month, I should be able to finish eliminating the demonic woman, and then come to protect you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Tang Ying. Chu Feng was someone who abided by his promises. As such, he would definitely do as he had promised.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng&hellip; I&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly, Tang Ying&rsquo;s expression changed. She started to suck in her lips. It was as if she was feeling some sort of grievance.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I am sorry. When I first saw you, I deliberately tried to pick a quarrel with you,&rdquo; Tang Ying said.<br>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile, &ldquo;Even a fool could tell that you were deliberately picking a quarrel with me. After all, you could have travelled through any region in that vast sky. Yet, you insisted on traveling where I was standing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is why I need to apologize to you. I picked a quarrel against you for no reason at all. Yet, not only did you not hold a grudge, you even saved me and the many guards of our Tang Family.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As you are my savior, my benefactor, I should have repaid your kindness unconditionally. However, when you mentioned that you wanted to find the Demon Subduing Spring, I brought forth conditions, and demanded that you be my bodyguard.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only did you agree to it, you are actually also this diligent towards it, and are thinking about my safety.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, I have clearly treated you like that, yet you have still treated me this good. I&hellip; I&hellip; wuu&hellip; I am truly a wretch.&rdquo;<br>As Tang Ying said those words, tears were already present in the corners of her eyes. Then, like water from the Yellow River, the tears were unstoppable, breaking through the dams and surging out from her eyes.<br>In the end, Tang Ying was still only a girl that had just reached the age of adulthood. However, her temperament was still only that of a girl.<br>It was because there were not many people that had treated her with sincerity in her life that she ended up being moved to tears when she encountered someone like Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Hey, hey, hey, don&rsquo;t act like this. Anyone that doesn&rsquo;t know what happened might think that I did something to you,&rdquo; Chu Feng urged with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Wuu!!!&rdquo; However, Tang Ying started to cry even louder.<br>&ldquo;Stop crying. If you continue to cry, I&rsquo;m going to act,&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly said.<br>&ldquo;Act, what?&rdquo; Tang Ying started at Chu Feng with a bewildered expression.<br>&ldquo;Your Tang Family possesses all those experts. What if they decide to put me to death from anger?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I had truly done something to you, my death would be justified. However, I have not done anything. Tell me, would my death be wrong or not?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, if you continue to cry, I&rsquo;m going to be shameless and bring you to the bed. I will have you have a taste of my ability.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Like that, even if your Tang Family were to kill me, I would not have died with grievances,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a mischievous smile across his face.<br>&ldquo;Puu&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing what Chu Feng said, that Tang Ying not only stopped crying, she even burst into laughter. She looked to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;When I first met you, you were quite cold. Never would I have expected that you&rsquo;re actually a hoodlum.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All men are hoodlums. However, I will only act like a hoodlum toward people that I have a favorable impression of.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, don&rsquo;t take my words to heart. I was merely joking around with you,&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke with righteousness.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing what Chu Feng said, Tang Ying, who was confident in her charm, was naturally somewhat angered. However, after thinking about it a bit, she did not break out with her bossy young miss temperament.<br>Instead, she forced down her anger and spoke to Chu Feng gently. &ldquo;Chu Feng, I am actually not the type of person like the me that you first met. I was only angered because of this matter of the arranged marriage with the Cao Family.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because my eldest brother and second brother said that if my father is not healed by the time the Cao Family attacks us, I must, for the sake of preserving our Tang Family, marry that retard.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you wish to marry that retard?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. I&rsquo;ve never even met him before,&rdquo; Tang Ying said as she shook her head.<br>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;But, this matter is already not something that I can decide,&rdquo; Tang Ying said.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to fear? I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Tang Ying with a beaming smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll protect you.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Tang Ying&rsquo;s expression grew sluggish again. She felt as if she did not dare to believe what she just heard. However, as she looked at Chu Feng who had an expression of sincerity across his face, she started to smile happily and said, &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;<br>She did not understand why. However, after Chu Feng said those words, she started to believe him deeply. She felt that Chu Feng would truly be able to protect her.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, this is bad!&rdquo; Suddenly, a servant girl rushed in.<br>&ldquo;A&rsquo;cai, aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be serving my father? Why would you run over here?&rdquo; Tang Ying asked impatiently.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, this is truly bad. You must escape immediately.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Grandmaster Kangping has fed Master the Ghostfiend Beast&rsquo;s bone powder. Yet, he is still unable to cure Master&rsquo;s injury.&rdquo; [1. Kangping &rarr; Peace and Prosperity. Not sure if it&rsquo;s his name or title yet.]<br>&ldquo;I heard the Eldest Young Master&rsquo;s discussion with the Second Young Master. They said that they planned to marry you to the Cao Family before they attacked the Tang Family so as to resolve the conflict with the Cao Family,&rdquo; The servant girl said.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?!&rdquo; Hearing those words, Tang Ying collapsed onto her butt. She had a completely dejected expression on her face.<br>&ldquo;Do you want me to bring you away?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I naturally want to run away. However, I cannot disregard the safety of the Tang Family,&rdquo; Tang Ying&rsquo;s voice grew very low. It went without saying that she was feeling very depressed.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, bring me over so that I can have a look at your father. I am also a world spiritist. I also possess some understanding of healing techniques. Perhaps I might be able to provide some assistance,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;How could I have forgotten about that? Very well, let&rsquo;s go over immediately,&rdquo; Tang Ying stood up, grabbed Chu Feng and began to rush out.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, you cannot go over there. Have you forgotten that Master has personally ordered that you are not allowed to enter his sleeping chambers?&rdquo; The servant girl said.<br>&ldquo;We have no time to worry about that,&rdquo; Tang Ying ignored the servant girl, tightly grabbed Chu Feng and rushed out with quick steps.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was the last straw for her to clutch at. She had placed all of her hopes onto Chu Feng.<br><br></p></div>
