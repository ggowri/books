        <div>: Do You Dare Fight With Me?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that you would have such means, but you shouldn&rsquo;t forget that these are my soldiers. I personally created them. They are fully under my control. You&rsquo;re dreaming if you think that you can use them to kill me,&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu spoke mockingly.<br>Despite his words, the struggling expression on his face and the aura emanated by the puppet army made it clear that it was not all under his control. Chu Feng was in control of the puppet army too!<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t have time to answer Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s provocation because he had to focus his full attention on controlling the puppet army.<br>In truth, Sima Xiangtu was also using his full strength to reinforce his control over the puppet army despite his calm expression. He dared not to let his guard down here.<br>At this point, they weren&rsquo;t just fighting over the Half-God level puppet that was near Situ Xiangtu. All nine thousand puppets had begun trembling intensely. Despite not exering their oppressive might, just the simultaneous release of their auras was more than enough to stir hurricanes all around.<br>It felt like the world had fallen silent other than the furious hurricanes and creaking puppets.<br>Be it those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, or the cultivators trapped here, everyone stared at this sight with fixated eyes. They knew what Chu Feng and Situ Xiangtu were fighting over, and the result of this fight would determine their fates.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Wang Yuxian wanted to say something to Chu Feng, but the Lady of Dao Sea stopped her right as she was about to open her mouth. The Lady of Dao Sea knew that they couldn&rsquo;t disturb Chu Feng at this moment, for the slightest lapse in concentration could spell the end.<br>However, Wang Yuxian could hardly remain calm as she stared at Chu Feng. She bit down on her lips, and her eyes had already reddened.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s veins were popping, and his muscles were tearing under the strain. Blood was seeping from his body. Even his bones were fracturing.<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t just giving his all here. He was putting his life on the line.<br>The truth was that Chu Feng&rsquo;s control over the puppet army was not on par with Situ Xiangtu, and he had fallen into a bad position as Situ Xiangtu started to get serious. Nevertheless, Chu Feng still continued to persist because of a single person&mdash;the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>His anger flared when he saw the pitiful state the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was. That made him more determined than ever to win this battle. He knew that he couldn&rsquo;t lose here, or else everyone whom he cared about here would die.<br>Pu!<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body suddenly trembled, and a mouthful of blood spurted from his mouth. Blood also started gushing from his nose, eyes, and ears.<br>If not for Wang Yuxian and Princess Xiaoxiao rushing forward to support him, he wouldn&rsquo;t even have the strength to remain on his feet.<br>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!<br>All of the puppets lifted their weapons and pointed them toward Chu Feng right after. None of them were trembling anymore.<br>Looking at the delighted look on Situ Xiangtu&rsquo;s face and Chu Feng&rsquo;s pathetic plight, the result of the battle was clear for all to see. Situ Xiangtu won this battle over the puppet army&rsquo;s control.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, master. I was incompetent,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a lowered head.<br>He dared not to lift his head to look at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. He felt that he had let the latter down.<br>&ldquo;Silly lad, what nonsense are you spouting? I have been watching. You haven&rsquo;t disappointed me. If anything, I am proud of you,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said with a hearty laugh.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. That disciple of yours has made you proud.&rdquo;<br>Surprisingly, Situ Xiangtu also acknowledged Chu Feng too.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you sure are impressive. If not for Yao Cheng telling me in advance that you have grasped the way to control the puppet army and I need to force you to make an appearance, the army that I have created might have just fallen into your hands. Unfortunately, you have been playing in my hands all this while. Still, I&rsquo;m glad that a prodigy like you is here. With you around, it&rsquo;ll be hard for me to fail!&rdquo; Situ Xiangtu said mockingly.<br>He raised his arm and opened the cage imprisoning the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. He wasn&rsquo;t planning on killing Chu Feng but to lock all of them up.<br>Situ Xiangtu was only sparing Chu Feng because he wanted to refine Chu Feng into a pill through his Immortal Cauldron. In his view. Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist were much more important than the tens of thousands of cultivators gathered here.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; a voice suddenly echoed.<br>Looking over, two silhouettes could be seen standing not too far away. One of them was Jiang Kongping, which had the formation Chu Feng had previously planted on him removed.<br>However, Chu Feng only spared a cursory glance at Jiang Kongping before looking at the man standing next to him. Those earlier words had come from this man.<br>He was none other than Jiang Yuantai.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re the one who defeated my younger brother?&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai asked.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. I was the one who kidnapped and injured your younger brother that day. If you wish to exact vengeance, you can come for me.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng steadied his posture, not faltering in the least even though his body was covered in blood.<br>&ldquo;You do have some backbone for daring to admit to everything. Aren&rsquo;t you afraid that I&rsquo;ll hurt your friend? Good. I&rsquo;ll give you a chance in view of your loyalty! Have a fight with me. If you can defeat me, I&rsquo;ll allow you and your friends to leave this place alive!&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai said.<br>&ldquo;Young master Yuantai, you mustn&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; Situ Xiangtu exclaimed in horror.<br>He was well aware of Chu Feng&rsquo;s means. It was one thing if Jiang Yuantai won the battle, but if he lost? He would lose one of his precious cultivation resources!<br>The moment Situ Xiangtu spoke up, Jiang Yuantai directed a cold glare at Situ Xiangtu.<br>&ldquo;What did you say? Are you telling me what to do right now?&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai said coercively.<br>Despite knowing that the powerful puppet army was under Situ Xiangtu&rsquo;s command, everyone could sense Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s presence overshadowing Situ Xiangtu&rsquo;s.<br>&ldquo;Young master Yuantai, that&rsquo;s not what I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Situ Xiangtu still wanted to explain himself, but Jiang Yuantai had no intention of listening to his explanation.<br>&ldquo;Did you think that you could go against our Pill Dao Immortal Sect with this bunch of wooden logs?&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai bellowed.<br>&ldquo;Young master Yuantai, that&rsquo;s not what I mean!&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu exclaimed in a panic.<br>&ldquo;Shut your mouth then. Who do you think you are to dare speak up before me?&rdquo;<br>Jiang Yuantai glared at Sima Xiangtu coldly, not giving the latter the slightest respect.<br>The crowd was shocked by this sight. They had witnessed the tremendous might of the puppet army, so they couldn&rsquo;t imagine the master of such a powerful puppet army being demeaned in such a manner.<br>This only went to show how formidable Jiang Yuantai was.<br>The puppet army was only a terrifying force for them. It might not necessarily hold a candle to the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.<br>In the blink of an eye, the person who was in control of the situation was no longer Situ Xiangtu but Jiang Yuantai.<br>Jiang Yuantai turned to Chu Feng and assessed the latter in interest.<br>&ldquo;To be frank, I didn&rsquo;t challenge you to exact vengeance for my younger brother. Rather, I received a prophecy stating that someone will hinder the business of our Pill Dao Immortal Sect in the Eastern Region, and that &lsquo;someone&rsquo; was revealed to be you. What&rsquo;s more laughable is that the prophecy predicted that I&rsquo;d be defeated by you.<br>&ldquo;No matter how I look at it, there&rsquo;s no way you could be a match for me. That&rsquo;s why, I want to go against heaven today and let everyone know that prophecies are meaningless before true power. I&rsquo;ll grasp my own fate. Chu Feng, do you dare to face me in a battle?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
