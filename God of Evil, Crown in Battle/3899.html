        <div> - Ancient Era&rsquo;s Organisms<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once he discovered that there were people approaching him, Chu Feng immediately concealed himself with the power of the spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Quick, faster, quickly. If we&rsquo;re late, others will snatch them.&rdquo;<br>Soon, over a dozen figures appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s field of view.<br>Those should all be Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms. Their appearances greatly resembled those in the mural.<br>One could describe them as monsters that were on the verge of transforming into humans&hellip; or humans with monstrous features.<br>They wore very simple clothing. They were practically naked, and had only covered their sensitive regions with crude leathers.<br>Their appearances resembled those of primitive humans.<br>However, Chu Feng clearly remembered that the mural of the one that resembled Yan Ruyu had clearly been wearing clothes.<br>Although those clothes were very special and different from ordinary clothes, they were very refined, and did not resemble the clothes these people were wearing.<br>Most importantly, Chu Feng was able to sense the cultivation of those people.<br>They were actually only Heavenly Immortals.<br>Not to mention that Chu Feng was currently enveloped with the power of the spirit formation, even if he didn&rsquo;t possess the power of the spirit formation, he would still be able to easily take care of them.<br>&ldquo;Strange. They&rsquo;re of a completely different caliber from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms I sensed before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that even Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms differ in strength?&rdquo;<br>This guess crossed Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind. However, he did not directly advance towards them to make inquiries.<br>Chu Feng wanted to know what exactly they were trying to do.<br>Waiting patiently, Chu Feng soon learned of their purpose.<br>They&rsquo;d come for the remains of those colossi.<br>Although those giant monsters&rsquo; meat had all been eaten, and even their source energies had been absorbed, they seemed to still be useful for those fellows.<br>Using special tools, they began to beat on the bones. After smashing the bones to pieces, glistening things were actually present in the bones.<br>Those were source energy remnants.<br>Remnant source energies could be used to train with. Merely, those source energies were extremely weak. They were so weak that Chu Feng could not determine the cultivation of the giant monsters when they were alive using those remnants.<br>Even if one were to train using those source energies, they would provide very little benefit. At least for Chu Feng, they would be of no use at all.<br>However, those fellows were carefully placing those source energy remnants away like they were treasures.<br>However, upon thinking about it, Chu Feng felt their behavior to be logical too. Although those soul energy remnants would not be useful for him, they would still be of enormous assistance to Heavenly Immortals.<br>&ldquo;Faster, faster! If we&rsquo;re slow, others will snatch them all! Quickly, all of you, work faster!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once we&rsquo;re done here, we&rsquo;ll have to take care of the next one!&rdquo;<br>The person who seemed to be the leader of the bunch was urging them nonstop.<br>Not only were they urging each other to be faster, but they were also conversing.<br>Through their conversations, Chu Feng gained a rough idea of what was happening.<br>Those giant monsters that had been killed, had indeed been hunted.<br>The ones that had hunted the giant monsters were the same species as the guys smashing and collecting the remnant source energies from the bones.<br>They were the same species, and yet not.<br>It turned out that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms not only differed in strength, but their statuses also differed enormously.<br>The fellows before Chu Feng were of the lowest tier bunch amongst the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms.<br>The powerful Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms would hunt those huge monsters. After hunting them, they would feed on their flesh and absorb their essence to increase their cultivation.<br>As for those people on the lowest rung of their society, they could only pulverize the bones of those huge monsters following the hunt, and gather the feeble remnants of their source energies to assist them in their cultivation.<br>In other words, they were a bunch of scavengers.<br>&ldquo;I wonder, would these guys possibly know about Yan Ruyu?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that those guys had such a low status, and recalling how Yan Ruyu&rsquo;s mural seemed so noble, Chu Feng began to doubt whether or not those guys would even be able to give him useful clues.<br>&ldquo;Forget about it. I&rsquo;ll know once I ask them.&rdquo;<br>Ultimately, Chu Feng decided to ask them.<br>Although Chu Feng had made his decision, he did not directly reveal himself. Instead, he first changed his appearance with his world spirit techniques.<br>Chu Feng changed himself to look similar to those Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms. Even his outfit had changed.<br>The reason why Chu Feng did that was because he did not want to reveal himself to be a cultivator.<br>Chu Feng was aware that there were a group of extremely powerful existences amongst the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms.<br>Otherwise, someone like the Great Monster Slayer Emperor wouldn&rsquo;t have warned Chu Feng not to provoke them.<br>Under such circumstances, Chu Feng felt that he couldn&rsquo;t cause trouble for them as a martial cultivator.<br>Otherwise, he might end up implicating other martial cultivators.<br>Thus, Chu Feng decided to disguise himself to be of the same species as them. He figured that would be the best choice.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a boundless oppressive might appeared out of the blue. That oppressive might completely overturned all the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms that were excavating source energies from the giant monsters&rsquo; remains.<br>&ldquo;Trash! What are you all doing?!&rdquo;<br>Following that, Chu Feng immediately appeared.<br>&ldquo;Milord, we were wrong, we were wrong. We merely wanted to gather some source energies from the bones of the Heaven-reaching Giant Spirit Beasts. We do not possess any malice at all.&rdquo;<br>Those fellows immediately knelt out of fear upon seeing Chu Feng.<br>Sure enough, Chu Feng&rsquo;s disguise was very useful. At the very least, they did not suspect him to be a martial cultivator. Instead, they thought that he was of the same species as them, merely someone with a grander status than them.<br>&ldquo;Motherfuckers! Who are you?!&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I am Gou Za.&rdquo; [1. Dog Leftovers.]<br>&ldquo;I am Gou Dan.&rdquo; [2. Dog Egg.]<br>&ldquo;I am Gou Pi.&rdquo; [3. Dog Skin]<br>&ldquo;I am Gou&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Those guys spoke their names in succession.<br>&lsquo;What sort of bullshit names are those?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;No matter what, you&rsquo;re Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms. Why would you have such dumb names?&rsquo;<br>Chu Feng had a look of astonishment after hearing those names.<br>However, he did not think too much about that. Instead, he continued loudly, &ldquo;Your daddy here is not asking for your names. Your daddy lost his memory due to the battle against those Heaven-reaching Giant Spirit Beasts. I can&rsquo;t remember shit. Thus, do you all know who I am?!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was trying to use having amnesia as an excuse to ask them about where he was.<br>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know, we don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, please don&rsquo;t make things difficult for us lowly ones. We are merely from the lowly Dog Clan that resides in the Dog Cave. How could we possibly know who Milord might be?&rdquo; Those fellows shook their heads repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;Motherfucker! Do you all know nothing?!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng took a glance of contempt at them.<br>&ldquo;Then what about this? Do you know who this person is?&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he took out a giant piece of stone. A mural was carved onto that giant piece of stone. That mural was that of Yan Ruyu.<br>Chu Feng had created that stone. However, the mural on it was exactly the same as the one on the wall.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; Milord, why&hellip; why would you be asking about her?&rdquo; asked those fellows in unison.<br>From their expressions, Chu Feng could tell that they most definitely knew about the woman on the mural that greatly resembled Yan Ruyu.<br>Thus, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;Although your daddy has lost his memory, I saw that mural by chance. I like the person on that mural a lot. Thus, I want to know who she is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you know who she is, tell me immediately. Do that, and I will spare you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, their expressions changed enormously.<br>A look of alarm appeared on their faces.<br>&ldquo;Milord, you must immediately take back what you said just now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, if other lords are to hear them, not only will you be killed, but we will also suffer.&rdquo;<br>Those fellows were actually kneeling and begging Chu Feng for forgiveness as they said those words. It was as if Chu Feng was demanding their lives.<br></p></div>
