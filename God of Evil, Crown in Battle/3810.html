        <div> - Prove One&rsquo;s Identity<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Brother, none of us are fools, why must you act this way?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing for you to put on a disguise for those ignorant trash. But for you to pretend in front of us, it&rsquo;s rather inexcusable, no?&rdquo;<br>One of the ten spread open his arms and spoke to Chu Feng with a mocking tone.<br>Hearing those words, the people of the younger generation present felt rather uncomfortable.<br>They were able to tell that the &lsquo;ignorant trash&rsquo; that person spoke of was them.<br>From those words, one could tell how arrogant and condescending those eleven were.<br>Unfortunately, those eleven were simply too powerful. They had the means to act arrogant and condescending. As such, the crowd did not dare to voice their anger.<br>Furthermore, they knew that a battle was about to unfold, and had already moved far away to hide. Some among them had even fled from the plaza directly in fear of being implicated.<br>It could be said that the only people that dared continue to stay were those with courage.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that everyone behaves like you. Just because you&rsquo;re not people of the younger generation does not mean that I am not one either,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>As Chu Feng said those words, his behavior and expression revealed one single emotion: contempt for those people.<br>&ldquo;That guy&rsquo;s skin is particularly thick.&rdquo;<br>Faced with Chu Feng acting like that, the tones of those eleven people became even more mocking.<br>&ldquo;Brother, we are not people that will bully the young.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are truly capable of proving that you&rsquo;re a person of the younger generation, we will definitely not bully you. We will even disregard that World Spirit Jade,&rdquo; said the person that spoke to Chu Feng first.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s simple. Set up a spirit formation to verify if one is a person of the younger generation. You all can set it up,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Straightforward.&rdquo; That man nodded. As he spoke, he immediately began setting up the spirit formation.<br>Soon, a spirit formation gate appeared before Chu Feng.<br>That said, he set up the spirit formation very secretly, and he deliberately concealed his strength.<br>Thus, not even Chu Feng was able to tell what level his world spirit techniques were at.<br>One thing was certain: his world spirit techniques were most definitely not inferior to Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>&ldquo;Brother, go ahead and pass through that gate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those of the younger generation are able to pass through the gate. If you&rsquo;re not a person of the younger generation, you will not be able to pass through the gate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are really able to pass through the gate and prove that you&rsquo;re a person of the younger generation, us brothers will immediately apologize to you, and then leave,&rdquo; said that man.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; as Chu Feng spoke, he began walking toward that spirit formation gate.<br>As Chu Feng set off, everyone&rsquo;s gaze was focused on him.<br>They all wanted to know if he was really a person of the younger generation.<br>If Chu Feng was truly a person of the younger generation, it would most definitely be something capable of shocking the entire Reincarnation Upper Realm, and even the All-heaven Starfield.<br>After all, never had they ever heard of a world spiritist genius of such a caliber. One such genius had never appeared in their All-heaven Starfield before.<br>The Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist defeated by Chu Feng had also managed to get back on his feet.<br>When he saw that Chu Feng was really walking towards that spirit formation gate, he mocked, &ldquo;Humph, he is truly shameless to the extreme. He&rsquo;s actually really trying it. I shall see how much longer he can pretend.&rdquo;<br>Anticipation filled his eyes. He was anticipating the scene of Chu Feng&rsquo;s embarrassment.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after he said those words, Chu Feng set foot into the spirit formation gate and managed to smoothly pass through it.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the expressions of the Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, the people of the younger generation present, and even the ten men who had brought pressure on Chu Feng all changed enormously.<br>They all had looks of disbelief in their eyes.<br>They truly had never imagined that Chu Feng was really a person of the younger generation.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip; I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The world spiritist Chu Feng had defeated earlier even turned speechless from shock.<br>To him, this was extremely humiliating. After all, this meant that he had been defeated by a person of the younger generation.<br>&ldquo;I truly never would&rsquo;ve imagined to encounter a rare genius world spiritist here today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To be able to become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist within a hundred years of age; with that talent, your future prospects are simply unlimited.&rdquo;<br>A series of claps sounded. It was that man from the group of ten that had first spoken with to Chu Feng.<br>Both his behavior and tone had revealed that he felt great admiration for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, that man&rsquo;s body shifted and disappeared.<br>When he reappeared, he was before Chu Feng. Furthermore, his hand was on the World Spirit Jade held by Chu Feng.<br>Fortunately, Chu Feng was prepared for it, and had grabbed the World Spirit Jade very tightly. Otherwise, that man would&rsquo;ve caught him off-guard, and snatched away his World Spirit Jade.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you&rsquo;re planning to go back on your word?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip; little brother, I can tell that you&rsquo;re a clever fellow. Since we are people that have gone as far as to cheat our way in here, how could we possibly be men of honor that keep our promises?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should let go. If you are to let go now, I can spare you. Otherwise&hellip; this old man cannot guarantee that you will be able to leave in one piece.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s voice was filled with a threatening tone.<br>However, Chu Feng showed no trace of fear. Coldly, he said, &ldquo;You want to take this World Spirit Jade? We&rsquo;ll have to see whether or not you all are capable of it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Capable? Little brother, since you said it like that, I&rsquo;ll have you evaluate my capability.&rdquo;<br>As that person spoke, marks appeared on his world spiritist cloak.<br>Seeing the marks, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed. The other people of the younger generation present were all struck dumb.<br>The reason for that was because the spirit power emitted by that person was not only Saint-level, but it was also Snake marked.<br>That man was a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>&ldquo;Little brother, what do you think about this old man&rsquo;s capability? Is it up to par?&rdquo;<br>The man looked to Chu Feng with a beaming smile. His tone was very egotistical.<br></p></div>
