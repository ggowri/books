        <h1>Chapter 4102</h1>
        <div> - Dragon Clan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What are you shouting about? Did you still not find yourself enough of a disgrace yet?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the martial cultivation world, neither conspiring in the dark nor conspiring openly matters. Since you&rsquo;ve failed to defeat your opponent, you deserve what happened to you.&rdquo;<br>Lei Tong did not act to help the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master. Instead, he began to berate him.<br>Because of that, the crowd thought that Lei Tong was a sensible person that handled things righteously.<br>However, right after Lei Tong finished saying those words, he turned his gaze to Long Daozhi, &ldquo;That said, you shouldn&rsquo;t be too excessive either. Everyone from the Purple Star Hall has kneeled. This sort of apology is already enough.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, an inheritance from one&rsquo;s ancestor cannot be lost. You should return that rank three Exalted Taboo Purple Meteor Shower.&rdquo;<br>Lei Tong was still standing above the clouds and looking down as he said those words.<br>Even though it was clearly the first time he had met Long Daozhi, and also possessed a rank six Utmost Exalted-level cultivation like him, he was overlooking Long Daozhi like he was his subordinate.<br>He was not consulting with Long Daozhi. Instead, he was ordering him.<br>However, it just so happened that no one felt Lei Tong&rsquo;s arrogance to be inappropriate.<br>After all, he was someone with extraordinary status and impressive strength.<br>He was indeed qualified to speak to Long Daozhi in such a manner.<br>That said, a scene that surprised the crowd occurred.<br>Long Daozhi showed no fear toward this Seven Stars Alliance&rsquo;s Supreme Elder. Instead, he smiled with contempt.<br>Then, what he said completely shocked the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Who do you think you are to dare order me around?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all left speechless upon hearing those words. They did not dare to believe their ears.<br>Has Long Daozhi gone mad? How could he dare to speak to Lei Tong in such a manner?<br>Even if he possessed overwhelming battle power and might be more powerful than Lei Tong, he still had to consider their respective status.<br>No matter how strong Long Daozhi might be, that was all that he was.<br>Lei Tong, on the other hand, was different. Behind him was the Seven Stars Alliance.<br>Not to mention rank six Utmost Exalted, the Seven Stars Alliance had multiple rank seven Utmost Exalted.<br>Furthermore, their Alliance Master had reached rank eight Utmost Exalted over three thousand years ago. After three thousand years, he was at peak rank eight Utmost Exalted, and could make a breakthrough to rank nine Utmost Exalted at any moment.<br>An existence like that was simply not someone Long Daozhi could provoke.<br>After all, the disparity between martial cultivators was one where a single level of cultivation was akin to a difference between heaven and earth.<br>If Long Daozhi were to offend the Seven Stars Alliance, there wouldn&rsquo;t even be a need for their Alliance Master to act. They could dispatch any rank seven Utmost Exalted and the entire Ancestral Martial Dragon City would be wiped out.<br>&ldquo;Who are you speaking those words to?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you cursing me?&rdquo; Lei Tong asked with a stern voice.<br>It was not only the bystanders that felt that they&rsquo;d misheard; even he felt that he might&rsquo;ve misheard Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not you, who am I cursing?&rdquo; replied Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Abandoned Starfield&rsquo;s trash, you&rsquo;re truly courting death!&rdquo;<br>Lei Tong grew furious. He shot forth a palm strike, and boundless martial power turned into a visible giant hand.<br>The giant hand was enormous. It measured several tens of thousands of meters across. Covering the sky and earth, if it were to land, it would not only be Long Daozhi who would suffer. Instead, many of the people present would also suffer a calamity alongside him.<br>However, to the crowd&rsquo;s surprise, Long Daozhi did not even bother to take a glance at the incoming attack. Instead, he merely waved his hand upward.<br>No astonishing attack appeared. Long Daozhi did not use any sort of martial skill. Only his ordinary martial power soared into the sky.<br>However, his martial power simply broke through everything and easily defeated Lei Tong&rsquo;s martial power giant hand.<br>Most shocking of all, even though it was a simple confrontation, Lei Tong actually stumbled several steps in midair. After he stabilized himself, he actually held his chest and revealed a look of pain. His distorted appearance made it seem like he was resisting something with great difficulty.<br>In the end, he was unable to resist it anymore...<br>He opened his mouth and sprayed out a large mouthful of blood.<br>In fact, blood was spraying out from his ears, his nose, and the corners of his eyes as well.<br>After all the bloodloss, Lei Tong was actually unable to stand firm. He lost his ability to fly and began falling from the sky.<br>It was actually the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master who rushed up to catch him. Else, Lei Tong would&rsquo;ve most definitely crashed into the ground.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The crowd simply did not dare to believe their eyes upon witnessing this scene.<br>Even though they already knew that Long Daozhi&rsquo;s battle power was very powerful, none of them had imagined that his battle power was this strong.<br>Even though they were both rank six Utmost Exalted, he managed to seriously injure Lei Tong with a simple wave of his hand.<br>&ldquo;Truly too weak. Never would I have imagined that there would be someone this weak.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your strength is far inferior to even the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, the Seven Stars Alliance must&rsquo;ve exhausted a lot of resources on you in order for you to gain your rank six Utmost Exalted-level cultivation.&rdquo;<br>After seriously injuring Lei Tong, Long Daozhi began to insult him.<br>However, his insults were not unwarranted.<br>Chu Feng could tell that even though Lei Tong was a rank six Utmost Exalted, his cultivation was extremely weak, and not firm at all.<br>This was the reason why there was such an enormous disparity between him and Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead! You dare injure me?! You&rsquo;re definitely dead!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Seven Stars Alliance will descend on your Ancestral Martial Starfield, your Ancestral Martial Dragon City!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only will you die, but everyone from your Ancestral Martial Dragon City will also die!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, you will realize how grave of a mistake you&rsquo;ve made today!&rdquo;<br>Even though Lei Tong was seriously injured, he was still speaking maliciously at Long Daozhi.<br>However, he had the confidence to do so. After all, standing behind him was the Seven Stars Alliance.<br>&ldquo;Another old fool who uses their backing to suppress others because their own strength is insufficient.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your mere Seven Stars Alliance actually dares to touch my Ancestral Martial Dragon City?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Open your dog eyes and look carefully at this.&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi took out a title plate as he spoke.<br>Before the crowd could even see the appearance of that title plate clearly, a beam of light soared out from it and into the clear sky.<br>The light covered the sky and, like clouds, enveloped the crowd below.<br>However, as the beam of light descended from the sky, a special sort of aura accompanied it.<br>That was not oppressive might, nor was it martial power or spirit power.<br>That&hellip; was bloodline power.<br>Once that bloodline power appeared, many cultivators felt their souls tremble.<br>That was an extremely powerful bloodline power.<br>Even Chu Feng revealed a startled look upon sensing that bloodline power.<br>Even though the bloodline power that covered the sky did not bring fear to Chu Feng, he was still able to sense how strong it was.<br>Then, the bloodline power began to change. Two giant words appeared from the light.<br>Dragon Clan!<br>[1. Long means Dragon.]<br>&ldquo;Clamor~~~&rdquo;<br>Astonishment filled the faces of everyone present the moment they saw those words. Immediately afterward, they all kneeled on the ground.<br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to Milord!&rdquo;<br>Those people all bowed respectfully to Long Daozhi.<br>Even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen and the people from the Purple Star Hall were doing the same.<br></p></div>
