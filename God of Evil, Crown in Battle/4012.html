        <h1>Chapter 4011</h1>
        <div> - Terrifying Everyone<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Unleash a massacre?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re truly one to boast. Do you really think our five great powers are a bunch of vegetarians?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Arrogant little thief, today, you will pay for what you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Zzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster was the first person to attack.<br>In his hand, the Wind Lightning Sword unleashed a completely different sort of power.<br>The lightning was like dragons and the violent wind was like blades. Even though it was clearly only a single sword, a single wave of the sword had unleashed a great army of wind and lightning that rushed to attack Chu Feng.<br>After the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster attacked, the other four leaders also attacked.<br>They did not hold back, and used powerful attacks from the get go. They planned to quickly subdue Chu Feng.<br>Whilst the leaders of the five great powers were taking on Chu Feng with their full power&hellip; the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster moved to the side.<br>He did not join the fray. Rather, he was healing his injuries and observing the situation of the battle.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what sort of power is that little bastard using?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be a treasure from the stone case world, right?&rdquo;<br>The All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster&rsquo;s expression was one of being very annoyed.<br>He discovered that even though the five great powers&rsquo; leaders were taking on Chu Feng together, they were still unable to suppress him. Instead, they were being slightly suppressed by Chu Feng instead.<br>One must know that those five were the strongest experts of five starfields. Yet, they were actually unable to defeat Chu Feng even after joining hands.<br>If the power Chu Feng displayed at that moment was truly brought forth by a treasure from the stone case world, one could very well tell how precious that treasure was from the battle power he displayed.<br>Just imagining the fact that such a heaven-defying treasure should&rsquo;ve belonged to him, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster became even more displeased.<br>&ldquo;I cannot let this go on.&rdquo;<br>The All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster knew that if this were to continue, even the five great powers&rsquo; leaders would not be a match for Chu Feng. He knew that they would be completely ruined.<br>Whilst the five great powers&rsquo; leaders might only be defeated, it would be completely different for him.<br>He would definitely be killed.<br>After all, Chu Feng was working with Zhao Hong and Han Xiu.<br>Because of that, he turned his gaze to Zhao Hong and Han Xiu, who were also treating their injuries.<br>After seeing them, a sinister smile emerged on Liu Shuo&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, his body shifted. He turned into a flash of light and flew towards Zhao Hong and Han Xiu.<br>He planned to capture them and use them to threaten Chu Feng.<br>Sensing his movements, Zhao Hong&rsquo;s expression changed enormously.<br>At that moment she was unable to contend against him at all.<br>She and Han Xiu were like fish on the chopping block, powerless to resist the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster&rsquo;s slaughter.<br>Most importantly, she knew what he intended to do.<br>If they were truly captured by him, Chu Feng would definitely be threatened by him.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>However, before the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster could reach Zhao Hong and Han Xiu, he suddenly stopped. Not only that, a look of fear was present on his face.<br>A figure had blocked his path. As for that person, it was none other than Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng had actually managed to breach the siege of the five leaders and block his path.<br>Furthermore, his gaze was incomparably cold. Even the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster turned pale with fright upon seeing that gaze.<br>&ldquo;Despicable bastard, don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re trying to do.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, the golden sword he held in his hand turned into a flash of light and thrust straight toward Liu Shuo&rsquo;s dantian.<br>The All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster tried to avoid the incoming sword. However, he was shocked to discover that Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword was many times faster than him.<br>It was simply impossible for him to avoid the sword.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>Blood splattered. Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword had pierced into Liu Shuo&rsquo;s dantian.<br>Then, Chu Feng swept his sword sideways.<br>Golden light streaked through the air. In the following moment, screams sounded.<br>When the crowd noticed what had happened, they were no longer only astonished.<br>They were completely bewildered to discover that the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had been sliced into two by Chu Feng.<br>His two halves then fell from the air and smashed ruthlessly into the ground.<br>Even though he was the sectmaster of the All-heaven Sect, no one had rushed over to catch him. His appearance was truly miserable.<br>Everyone knew that the people from the All-heaven Sect definitely wanted to rush over to catch him. Unfortunately, none of them dared to do so.<br>Even their strongest Lord Sectmaster was powerless to take on Chu Feng, they would simply be throwing their lives away if they were to rashly rush over.<br>Seeing the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster struggling in a pool of blood with his body sliced in two, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions became even more complicated.<br>Although the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster was still alive, his cultivation had been damaged and he was seriously injured. The crowd were also able to imagine through his miserable heart-wrenching screams what sort of suffering he was undergoing at that moment.<br>But, one should know that he was the sectmaster of the All-heaven Sect, the strongest expert of the All-heaven Starfield.<br>Yet, someone like him had actually been defeated by a person of the younger generation.<br>When they thought of that and looked to Chu Feng again, fear filled their eyes.<br>&ldquo;Are you all still planning to get in my way?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re still planning to do so, you&rsquo;ll also end up like him.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng turned his chilly gaze to the leaders of the five great powers.<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze, they all felt their hearts tremble. Even though they were grand existences, looks of fear were still present in their eyes.<br>They&rsquo;d all felt Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power through their earlier confrontation, and knew how strong he was.<br>Truth be told, they&rsquo;d already realized that even if they decided to join hands, they would still find it very difficult to defeat the youngster called Asura.<br>In addition, the Chu Feng at that moment seemed to be even more powerful than the one they had fought earlier.<br>There was no longer the image of a second individual on Chu Feng.<br>The golden gases were burning on Chu Feng&rsquo;s body like flames.<br>It was as if they&rsquo;d already fused together.<br>They were able to imagine that Chu Feng must&rsquo;ve unleashed that power to its pinnacle.<br>They were simply no match for him.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for showing leniency, young friend.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since young friend is such a loyal and righteous person, our Miao Heavenly Clan will not look further into what happened here today.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief put his weapon away and clasped his fist respectfully at Chu Feng.<br>After saying those words, he actually soared into the sky and flew to where the Miao Heavenly Clansmen were.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Miao, what is the meaning of this?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, both the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s sectmasters were confused.<br>However, the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did not even bother to turn around. Just like that, he'd left.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, our Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion will also not get in your way anymore.&rdquo;<br>Then, the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion&rsquo;s pavilion master actually also clasped his fist respectfully at Chu Feng before flying in the direction of his people.<br>&ldquo;You two&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The expressions of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster turned even uglier.<br>&ldquo;You still can&rsquo;t tell what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Asura&rsquo;s strength is more than capable of killing us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, look carefully at your bodies. Is there a single bruise, a single wound?&rdquo; The Inferno Academy&rsquo;s headmaster said to the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster and Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>They&rsquo;d naturally realized that they were uninjured, and that Chu Feng had been showing leniency towards them.<br>Yet, they were unwilling to reconcile. They were unwilling to let Chu Feng slip away just like that; they were unwilling to let him take away the mysterious treasure from the stone case world.<br>&ldquo;No matter what, you are all leaders of your respective powers. How could you be this lacking in confidence that you&rsquo;re scared to such a state by a person of the younger generation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Utter disgrace.&rdquo;<br>The Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster, those two arch-enemies, were actually joining hands to insult the other three leaders.<br>They were trying to urge them to act and join hands against Chu Feng again with their insults.<br>Unfortunately, not only did the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion&rsquo;s pavilion master ignore them completely, but even the Inferno Academy&rsquo;s headmaster who stood right next to them looked at them with contempt.<br>&ldquo;Truly pigheaded.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, the two of you can continue.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man is not going to accompany you.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Inferno Academy&rsquo;s headmaster waved his sleeve, turned around and left.<br>With that, only the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster and the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster remained.<br>They looked towards Chu Feng, who stood in the sky not far away from them with a golden sword in hand and surging golden gas all over his body, and then to the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, who was screaming on the ground. They did not dare to attack Chu Feng, yet they were unwilling to retreat.<br>They momentarily found themselves in an extremely awkward and embarrassing situation.<br></p></div>
