        <div> - Seeing Yuan Shu Again<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Do you also think that someone was deliberately helping us when we were separated back then?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t someone deliberately helping us, the experiences we had simply cannot be explained,&rdquo; said Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve actually considered that myself. Merely, I don&rsquo;t know who could possibly be helping us.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had actually long suspected that the power that had separated them in the Path to Heaven had been no coincidence or chance encounter. Rather, someone had deliberately been trying to help them.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng already had a guess as to who that person might have been.<br>He felt that it was very possibly his father, Chu Xuanyuan, that had helped him.<br>Of course, Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess was without any basis at all. It was purely a guess, purely according to his intuition. That was why he didn&rsquo;t mention it to Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;Since even you don&rsquo;t know, it would be very difficult to know who this hidden benefactor of ours might be,&rdquo; sighed Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;If that person wants us to know who they are, we&rsquo;ll find out sooner or later.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that person doesn&rsquo;t want us to know, we should stop making guesses,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Mn.&rdquo; Zhao Hong nodded in agreement.<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right, why are you disguising your identity?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I hadn't heard your voice, I truly would have been deceived by you.&rdquo;<br>Zhao Hong suddenly looked to Chu Feng with curiosity.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve returned to my clan. However, my clan and I are simply too weak in this galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You know how I am, I&rsquo;m always stirring up trouble left and right. I do not wish to bring trouble to my friends and family. Thus, I had no choice but to take on a different identity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With that, I will be able to move with more ease,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty good choice you&rsquo;ve made. Since that&rsquo;s the case, you should continue with your disguise.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;People only know that I, Zhao Hong, and you, Asura, are friends. Thus, even if I end up provoking trouble, they will only seek out Asura, and not your Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; said Zhao Hong.<br>Zhao Hong and Chu Feng then chatted about their future plans.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s plan was naturally to stabilize the position of his clan. Only after the position of the Chu Heavenly Clan was stabilized would he be able to leave the Holy Light Galaxy with his mind at ease to search for his mother.<br>As for Zhao Hong, she did not plan to reestablish the Reincarnation Sect. She decided to stay with the Red-dress Holy Land and have them become the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s overlord.<br>Zhao Hong and Chu Feng&rsquo;s plans were actually rather similar. The only difference was that Chu Feng wanted to help the Chu Heavenly Clan, whereas Zhao Hong wanted to help the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Furthermore, both of them had to increase their cultivations.<br>Unavoidably, their conversation drifted to their battle with the All-heaven Sect.<br>&ldquo;I know that the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted has escaped. Merely, I never would&rsquo;ve expected Tuoba Chengan to have also taken advantage of the chaos to escape.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That old bastard, I thought he was loyal and devoted to the All-heaven Sect. Never would I have imagined him to be so cunning. Sensing that the situation had taken a turn for the worst, he actually decided to flee before everyone else.&rdquo;<br>Through their conversation, Chu Feng learned that someone else apart from the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had escaped Zhao Hong&rsquo;s massacre. That person was the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s Supreme Elder Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;Tuoba Chengan&rsquo;s strength cannot be looked down on. Furthermore, he is extremely cunning and ruthless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he is not eliminated, I will not be able to ease my heart. LIkely, he will retaliate against the Red-dress Holy Land,&rdquo; said Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;With you here, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll dare to attempt anything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, Headmaster Han would be able to take on Tuoba Chengan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, Tuoba Chengan has committed all sorts of evil deeds. He is indeed someone that should be eliminated,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right, there&rsquo;s something else I needed to tell you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those friends of yours have left.&rdquo;<br>As Zhao Hong spoke, she took out a letter and handed it to Chu Feng.<br>That letter was from the Mystic Cave Saints. It was a very simple farewell letter.<br>The Mystic Cave Saints were going to leave the All-heaven Starfield. Merely, the letter did not say where they planned to go.<br>Chu Feng knew that the Mystic Cave Saints were people who carried great hatred on their backs. As such, the &lsquo;someday&rsquo; in the &lsquo;we&rsquo;re sure we&rsquo;ll meet again someday&rsquo; could possibly be never.<br>The world of martial cultivators was vast and boundless. It would be difficult to meet again after they parted.<br>With the relationship between Chu Feng and Zhao Hong, the two of them would naturally have to reminisce now that they had encountered one another again.<br>Merely, if Chu Feng had to describe his experiences to Zhao Hong in detail, even three days and nights would likely not be sufficient.<br>As Chu Feng had important matters to attend to, he merely spent a short while reminiscing with Zhao Hong before preparing to leave the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Chu Feng needed to go to the Seven Suns Mountain Range to seek out Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>After all, Chu Feng&rsquo;s original purpose for traveling to the All Heaven Starfield was to breach Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s spirit formation.<br>Chu Feng would naturally not forget about this important matter.<br>Of course, he also had to tell Yuan Shu and Grandmaster Tang Chen of what he'd encountered at Mount Ivory Valley.<br>Upon arriving at the Nine Suns Mountain Range, Chu Feng saw Yuan Shu again.<br>However, he was still unable to meet Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>That said, he still informed Yuan Shu about the matters regarding Mount Ivory Valley.<br>However, through their conversation, Chu Feng learned that the mysterious expert that had helped the White-dress Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster back then was actually Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>Furthermore, Grandmaster Tang Chen and Yuan Shu also had also been to Mount Ivory Valley later on.<br>As for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms inside Mount Ivory Valley, they had all been killed.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen had deduced that the person who had killed those Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms was an expert cultivator.<br>Chu Feng was very shocked to learn all that.<br>Chu Feng had witnessed the sight of those Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms being massacred that day.<br>However, he had thought it to be the descent of a catastrophe.<br>However, it turned out that it had actually been caused by a cultivator.<br>Chu Feng had sensed how powerful those Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms had been.<br>As such, he could imagine how powerful the cultivator that had obliterated those Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms was.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that brother Chu Feng would also have been present during Mount Ivory Valley&rsquo;s calamity. In that case, did you notice any very powerful individuals?&rdquo; asked Yuan Shu.<br>As the scene at Mount Ivory Valley had been extremely brutal, it had even affected someone like Yuan Shu.<br>Adding on the guess and evaluation made by his master, Yuan Shu was very curious as to who the mysterious expert that had obliterated those Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms could be.<br>Even though he knew that it might be impossible for Chu Feng to encounter an expert of that caliber, he was unable to keep himself from asking him due to being overly curious. Even if it was only the slightest smidgen of hope, he still wanted to give it a try.<br>&ldquo;I didn't discover any expert like that. That said, I did encounter a rather strange old granny,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a pensive look.<br>&ldquo;Strange old granny? What sort of person was she?&rdquo;<br>Yuan Shu realized that things might not be simple, and immediately dug into the topic.<br>Chu Feng then told Yuan Shu about his encounter with the old granny.<br>Furthermore, for the sake of rescuing Linghu Yueyue, Chu Feng had decided to return to Mount Ivory Valley by himself.<br>It was only later that he learned that the old granny had also left in the direction of Mount Ivory Valley after he'd left.<br>If someone were to be suspected of being that mysterious expert, then Chu Feng felt that the old granny would be the only suspect in his mind.<br>&ldquo;Did you encounter that old lady at Mount Ivory Valley later on?&rdquo; asked Yuan Shu.<br>No,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>&ldquo;In that case, did you manage to see that Old Granny again?&rdquo; asked Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head again.<br>&ldquo;Ssss~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, then that old granny is truly remarkable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, could you draw a portrait of that old granny?&rdquo; As Yuan Shu spoke, he took out a blank drawing scroll.<br>Chu Feng did not hesitate. Just like that, he drew a portrait of the old granny on the scroll.<br>&ldquo;Brother Yuan Shu, if there&rsquo;s nothing else, I&rsquo;ll be taking my leave first,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m returning to the Ancestral Martial Starfield. It&rsquo;s time for me to return,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;In that case, you should attempt to breach that spirit formation before you leave,&rdquo; said Yuan Shu.<br>Hearing &lsquo;spirit formation,&rsquo; a look of joy immediately appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;Is that spirit formation the spirit formation left behind by Grandmaster Tang Chen?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mn. Although master is not here, he has told me the location of the spirit formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are now able to challenge the grand formation that my esteemed master has spent great effort to set up,&rdquo; said Yuan Shu.<br></p></div>
