        <h1>Chapter 3765</h1>
        <div> - Crazed Man<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Was that also the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s trick?&rdquo;<br>There was an unconcealable look of shock on Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s face as she asked.<br>It was merely a spirit formation, yet it had a speed that she could not catch up to.<br>Recalling the protective formation that Chu Feng had unleashed earlier, Gu Mingyuan once again realized how small and weak she actually was...<br>Although she was a top existence in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, she was only a weakling before true experts.<br>&ldquo;That voice was his. Naturally, that spirit formation would be his too," Grandmaster Liangqiu said with a smile.<br>He was actually feeling very joyous. Although the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had made him realize there was an enormous disparity between them, so much that he simply could not take on the title of the strongest world spiritist in the Ancestral Martial Starfield with the Ox-nosed Old Daoist present, it remained that he could be considered to be the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s close friend.<br>When he thought of how he was capable of befriending such an existence, Grandmaster Liangqiu felt very fortunate.<br>&ldquo;I truly never would&rsquo;ve imagined for that old codger Ox-nose to have concealed himself so deeply.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I had originally thought that the Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s City Master Long Daozhi was already someone who had concealed his strength extremely well. Never would I have imagined that Ox-nose would&rsquo;ve concealed his strength even more.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, even Long Daozhi would not be able to match Ox-nose.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That old codger is the most terrifying existence in the Ancestral Martial Starfield,&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan said with a gasp of admiration.<br>She was not the only one thinking this way. Both Chu Xuanzhengfa and Chu Lingxi felt this way too. Compared to Long Daozhi, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s strength shocked them even more.<br>After all, the impression he had left on them before was truly lacking. The worse of an impression they had of him, the more astonished they were.<br>&ldquo;To be exact, he is not someone from our Ancestral Martial Starfield,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu added.<br>Hearing those words, the expressions of Gu Mingyuan and the others all changed. Then, they all turned silent.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s words had startled them awake.<br>Indeed, their Ancestral Martial Starfield couldn&rsquo;t possibly possess such a powerful martial cultivator.<br>After all, in the Holy Light Galaxy, their Ancestral Martial Starfield could simply be said to be the weakest of all the starfields.<br>After gasping with admiration, Gu Mingyuan turned her gaze to Chu Feng.<br>Curious, she asked, &ldquo;Chu Feng, what did you agree to help the Ox-nosed Old Daoist with?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, it&rsquo;s nothing much. It&rsquo;s merely a trifling matter. I will be able to handle it myself." Chu Feng did not wish to mention the matter he had promised to help the Ox-nosed Old Daoist with to Gu Mingyuan. He felt that if he was to tell her, she would definitely not allow him to depart on his own.<br>Had it been before, Gu Mingyuan might still agree to it. However, now, she would definitely not agree to it.<br>After all, the All-heaven Starfield was ruled by the All-heaven Sect.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, that Linghu Zhishi is still alive. Now that the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd has been retrieved by Ox-nose, if you were to wander around on your own at a time like this, it could be very dangerous.&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s expression changed. The crowd all understood what her intentions were.<br>The word &lsquo;worried&rsquo; was practically written all over her face.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I&rsquo;ve experienced all sorts of dangers in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I know that senior is worried about me. However, I will have to grow up on my own. Thus, it&rsquo;s better to allow me to handle this matter by myself," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true." Gu Mingyuan smiled. Then, she said, &ldquo;Boy, your advancing speed is truly rapid. Likely, the Ancestral Martial Starfield will no longer be able to contain you.&rdquo;<br>After she finished saying those words, Gu Mingyuan looked to Chu Lingxi, who stood beside her. &ldquo;Girl, you will have to put forth more effort. Otherwise, you will not be able to match up to your big brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mother, what are you talking about? What &lsquo;big brother Chu Feng&rsquo;? He&rsquo;s clearly younger than me. He&rsquo;s my little brother, okay?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi corrected with a serious attitude.<br>Soon, she seemed to have realized something. She said, &ldquo;What do you mean by I can&rsquo;t match up to him? Why must I be a match for him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You yourself know very well the reason why." Gu Mingyuan revealed a mischievous smile.<br>&ldquo;Truly! You&rsquo;re clearly my mother, why are you helping an outsider bully me?&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s face turned red. After she finished saying that, she ran away.<br>That said, no one was able to tell if her face had turned red from anger, or something else.<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Senior, about that Blood Devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, how are we to handle him?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve reminded me of that. That fellow is still alive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. We&rsquo;ll go and finish him together," Gu Mingyuan looked to Chu Xuanzhengfa as she said those words.<br>How could Chu Xuanzhengfa dare to neglect her? He immediately began to lead her to the location where the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was imprisoned.<br>&ldquo;Senior, has that Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master confessed?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That old fellow is truly tough-mouthed. He is clearly an evil-doer, but he has insisted on upholding loyalty, righteousness and whatnot.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, don&rsquo;t fret, I will definitely make him speak. After all, I&rsquo;m already holding his weakness," said Gu Mingyuan.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng knew that Gu Mingyuan must&rsquo;ve found the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s rumored grandson.<br>Sure enough, after Chu Xuanzhengfa opened the gate to where the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was imprisoned, everyone could see that the Hall Master was no longer the only person imprisoned there.<br>In addition to him was a man.<br>That man appeared to be over eight hundred years old.<br>Normally, based on the age of martial cultivators, that man could still be considered to be a young man.<br>However, his head was already filled with white hair, and his appearance was extremely aged.<br>The reason why he looked that way was because his cultivation was extremely weak. He was only a Half Martial Emperor.<br>If he were placed in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, his Half Martial Emperor cultivation would make him a top expert.<br>However, in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, a place with experts akin to trees in a forest, where even Martial Immortals were numberless, Half Martial Emperor would be truly akin to a powerless ant.<br>Not to mention Exalted-level experts like Chu Feng and the others, or Utmost Exalted-level experts like Gu Mingyuan, even a True Immortal could drown him with a spit or shatter his soul with a breath.<br>That was the disparity in cultivation.<br>However, that person was extremely intimate with the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master. Without needing to think, Chu Feng knew that he must be his grandson.<br>Merely, how could the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, someone so powerful, have such a weak grandson?<br>Furthermore, although that man was well-dressed, his mannerisms seemed somewhat strange.<br>&ldquo;Grand&hellip; grandpa.&rdquo;<br>When Chu Feng and the others approached, that man immediately lost his head out of fear and hid behind the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>Judging by his panicked appearance, Chu Feng felt even more astonished. That man was not only weak; his head seemed to have some issues too. It was very possible that the man was mentally handicapped.<br>&ldquo;The grandfather and grandson seem to be getting along very well,&rdquo; a gloomy and cold gaze appeared in Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;How could a retard like this be my grandson? Gu Mingyuan, have you gone mad?&rdquo; The Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master revealed a mocking smile. He was not admitting that man to be his grandson.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you&rsquo;re planning to refuse a toast so that you can be forced to drink a forfeit," Gu Mingyuan said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already said that I will not tell you anything even if you are to kill me,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Very well. I shall see how tough your mouth really is.&rdquo;<br>As Gu Mingyuan spoke, she extended her hand and made a grabbing motion. Suction power was immediately released from her hand.<br>The suction brought that crazed man into her palm. Like a watermelon, his head was tightly grabbed by Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s palm.<br>At that moment, the man was crying and screaming, trying his hardest to struggle. However, he was simply unable to break free from Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s grasp.<br>&ldquo;Gu Mingyuan, what are you planning to do?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, the expression of the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master changed enormously.<br>Terror filled his previously calm eyes.<br></p></div>
