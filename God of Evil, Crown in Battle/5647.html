        <h1>Chapter 5647: Chu Feng Trapped</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You have already gotten here?&rdquo; the blue-cloaked man asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; someone in the crowd replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that in your hand?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fruit Lord Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span> mentioned that enhances one&rsquo;s psyche.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You already obtained the fruit? How can you be ahead of us? What gives you the right to be ahead of us?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blue-cloaked man and his group were indignant. They were all prodigious world spiritists from formidable backgrounds, or else they wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to come this far. To them, Chu Shanshan and the others were no different from trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, </span><span>these trash</span><span> actually obtained quite a number of the legendary fruits ahead of them without suffering any injuries. This naturally displeased them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be so agitated. We didn&rsquo;t do this with our strength. It was all thanks to young hero Chu Feng. In case you&rsquo;re wondering, I&rsquo;m referring to the Chu Feng who has the favor of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master, though I have to add that he has the capability to back that up,&rdquo; the man who had attempted to grab the </span><span>Purpledemon</span><span> Dagger earlier on said with a proud expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blue-cloaked man and the others looked conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them had taken Chu Feng&rsquo;s trial, thinking it was beneath them to do so. They had only wanted to make use of Chu Feng to clear the way for them, especially since they were planning to clinch first place in this combat exam themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the fact that they managed to get this far safely proved their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, they paid a price for that. There were initially 21 people in their alliance, but 8 of them died along the way. Even the survivors had sustained considerable injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Chu Shanshan and the others were completely unharmed, and it was solely due to Chu Feng. This further highlighted Chu Feng&rsquo;s capability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn&rsquo;t want to acknowledge Chu Feng, but the situation was leaving them with </span><span>no choice but to do so. This was why they were feeling conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Chu Feng?&rdquo; the blue-cloaked man asked, having noticed that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t in the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng has ventured into the deepest and most dangerous area in this realm. That&rsquo;s not an area you can challenge, so I advise you not to recklessly head there,&rdquo; the man whose palm was seared by the </span><span>Purpledemon</span><span> Dagger said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; The blue-cloaked man narrowed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Shanshan quickly noticed the change in atmosphere and hurriedly added, &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng has been gone for a while now. He&rsquo;s likely to be on his way back.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blue-cloaked man burst into laughter upon hearing those words. &ldquo;Young miss, you have a fast reaction, but it&rsquo;s a pity that your nervous eyes betrayed you. Chu Feng isn&rsquo;t going to return anytime soon, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What do you mean by that? What are you planning to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Shanshan and the others panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t your fruits be ours once we take your life? A bunch of trash like you aren&rsquo;t worthy of taking those fruits. Hand it all over!&rdquo; the blue-cloaked man bared his killing intent as he ordered them haughtily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw out a world spiritist treasure toward Chu Shanshan and the others, which quickly morphed into a slaughter formation. The slaughter formation was formidable, wielding the power to instantaneously kill all of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slaughter formation crumbled before it could reach Chu Shanshan and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Xiao </span><span>Yueyue&rsquo;s</span><span> doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood in front of the crowd with her bloodline ability activated, which raised her cultivation from rank three Half-God level to rank four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span>? Didn&rsquo;t you part ways with them?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of thirteen revealed looks of unease upon seeing Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of your business,&rdquo; Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> sneered as she unleashed her martial skill on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of thirteen quickly constructed formations to deal with her onslaught, but to their dismay, they realized that they were unable to quickly defeat Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span>. This left them with no choice but to turn tail and flee. They were worried that Chu Feng might return if they got stalled here. That would really put them in a terrible position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> didn&rsquo;t bother chasing after them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the thirteen people were of terrible character, their strength was not to be made light of. Even though they were all severely injured, it would still be difficult for her to simultaneously deal with all of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Shanshan and the others bowed to Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> and said, &ldquo;Miss Xiao, thanks for your help.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You need not thank me. I&rsquo;m only doing this out of respect for Chu Feng,&rdquo; Xiao </span><span>Yueyue</span><span> said before waving her sleeves to conceal herself once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd&rsquo;s impression of her changed despite her cold attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng had already reached the depth of the desert. He noticed that the area right beneath the center of the lightning cloud was unusually safe despite the clamor happening above. He didn&rsquo;t encounter a single ferocious beast despite having traveled for some time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, he dared not to let down his guard and continued surveying his surroundings, knowing that there was a chance he might encounter a rank six Half-God level enemy here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng could deal with one or two of such ferocious beasts, but if there was an army of them, and they were capable of constructing formations that further raised their fighting prowess, that could potentially pose a threat to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground suddenly rumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Chu Feng noticed that something was amiss, multiple chains had already shot out of the ground to bind him. It all happened so fast that he couldn&rsquo;t dodge at all. At the same time, hundreds of formation pillars rose from the ground and unleashed terrifying lighting, forming a lightning cage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an incredibly powerful sealing formation that took an Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist a long time to construct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;d get careless,&rdquo; a voice echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng looked over and was surprised to see someone he recognized walking over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you?&rdquo;</span></p></div>
