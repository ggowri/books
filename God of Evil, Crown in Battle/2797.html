        <div> - Actually Feigning Death<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>After deciding, Chu Feng took out three medicinal pellets from his Cosmos Sack and tossed them into his mouth.<br>Of those three medicinal pellets, one was purely to alleviate Chu Feng&rsquo;s pain, one was focused on recovering spirit power, and the last one was one of the medicinal pellets the Golden Crane True Immortal gave Chu Feng that could retard the intensity of the pain.<br>After he finished making all his preparations, Chu Feng closed his eyes and began to attempt to make a breakthrough again.<br>However, after Chu Feng started his breakthrough attempt, that unbearable pain once again came like an explosion.<br>The pain was simply too intense. Even though Chu Feng had already taken three pain-relieving medicinal pellets, they were only able to ease the pain slightly. It would still be up to Chu Feng as to whether or not he would be able to endure the pain.<br>Unfortunately, the pain was simply too unreal. Chu Feng felt as if his head was currently being slowly sliced apart. He felt as if his head was slowly being torn away by someone. That sort of pain was absolutely unbearable.<br>Under such conditions, Chu Feng quickly stopped attempting to make a breakthrough.<br>Although Chu Feng had failed again, he was not dispirited.<br>&ldquo;How was it? Is it no good?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not it. I&rsquo;ll try again.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng started to ease the pain. After his state returned to normal, he attempted to make a breakthrough again.<br>Chu Feng failed once again. However, he was able to endure the pain for a slightly longer period than his earlier attempt.<br>Chu Feng started to ease his pain for a short while again. Then, he once again attempted to make a breakthrough. His fourth attempt was a bit longer than even his third.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s hope. Eggy, there&rsquo;s hope. Although it&rsquo;s very unbearable, I am gradually getting used to the pain. Should I continue to attempt making a breakthrough, I will be able to endure the pain longer.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as I can endure the pain for a sufficient amount of time, I will be able to reach my breakthrough.&rdquo;<br>After his several attempts, Chu Feng not only did not crumble from the unbearable pain, but he was instead wild with joy. He had discovered the method to reach a breakthrough. Furthermore, he firmly believed that this method was feasible.<br>&ldquo;Good, as long as it&rsquo;s possible. Merely, you must make sure to not force yourself,&rdquo; Although Chu Feng felt overjoyed, Her Lady Queen was feeling very pained.<br>She knew very well that Chu Feng&rsquo;s opportunity was using his own body to endure unbearable pain repeatedly.<br>However, it was different for Chu Feng. Chu Feng felt that he could endure as much pain and torment as needed. The only thing that he could not endure would be stagnation.<br>Thus, Chu Feng started to attempt to make breakthroughs in unbroken succession. He began to use his own body to adapt to the unbearable pain.<br>Sure enough, it was as Chu Feng had anticipated. With each successive attempt, Chu Feng started to gradually adapt to the pain and began to endure the pain longer.<br>Chu Feng knew very well that he would need a certain amount of time should he want to make a breakthrough to Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Thus, while he was attempting to make his breakthrough, he was not actually doing it. He was merely letting his body get used to the pain. As long as Chu Feng was able to extend the amount of time he could endure the pain every time, Chu Feng would have succeeded.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at the moment when Chu Feng was focused on making his continued attempts, a burst of ripples emerged from above.<br>Chu Feng looked upward. He was able to faintly see golden light flickering above.<br>&ldquo;This sensation, it&rsquo;s Dragon Mark Immortal-level spirit power. Could it be&hellip; one of those two girls managed to make a breakthrough to Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That seems to be the case. After all, those two girls are very talented too. Merely, I wonder which one of them has managed to reach a breakthrough first?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, another ripple emerged from above. Looking up, another golden light appeared, and was faintly flickering in the lake above Chu Feng.<br>Although he was very far away, Chu Feng was still capable of seeing that there were two lights flickering in the lake above him.<br>The two lights were like two stars that had fallen into the water. As they reflected their light upon one another, they seemed to be contending with one another.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the other one has managed to make a breakthrough too. Those two girls are quite amazing,&rdquo; Chu Feng was unable to contain himself from praising them.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, they&rsquo;re quite amazing. However, if it wasn&rsquo;t for your spirit power being damaged, you would definitely be the first one to make the breakthrough to Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>Her Lady Queen had most definitely not said those words to encourage Chu Feng. Rather, that was truly what she was thinking.<br>After all, it had been some time since Chu Feng had first attempted to make his breakthrough.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power being damaged, then with his talent, Chu Feng would have already successfully made his breakthrough the first time around.<br>Thus, when judging by that alone, the speed of Chu Feng&rsquo;s breakthrough was much faster than those two girls.<br>&ldquo;I will be satisfied as long as I can make my breakthrough today,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Then, Chu Feng continued to make his attempts. Perhaps because he was affected by Chu Lingxi and Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s breakthroughs, Chu Feng managed to endure the pain for an especially long time.<br>Chu Feng continued to make two more attempts after that. Then, he took out three medicinal pellets and swallowed them.<br>&ldquo;Are you planning on making your breakthrough now?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;I will say the same thing, you must act accordingly and not force yourself,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured Milady Queen, I will definitely act accordingly and not force myself.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he closed his eyes. Soon, his expression started to twist. The pain had returned again. However, Chu Feng was no longer grunting in pain.<br>He merely gritted his teeth and endured the pain. He wanted to successfully make the breakthrough to become a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Meanwhile, Xia Yun&rsquo;er had no idea that Chu Feng was still alive, hiding deep below Buried Spirit Lake and attempting to make a breakthrough to become a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Thus, thinking that Chu Feng had already been killed by her, Xia Yun&rsquo;er revealed a joyous smile on her beautiful face after she successfully made her breakthrough to Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Although she knew that the speed of her breakthrough was slower than Chu Lingxi, it was only slightly slower, and within the extent that she could accept.<br>&ldquo;Lady Chu Lingxi, congratulations on becoming a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er revealed an exceptionally charming smile at Chu Lingxi. After all, she was feeling joy from the bottom of her heart at that moment. Likely, her congratulations were also sincere. Thus, compared to her usual smiles, this smile appeared exceptionally beautiful.<br>&ldquo;Congratulation to you too,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi returned a congratulation with a smile on her face. Her smile was very sweet and clean. It was also extremely charming.<br>It must be said that these two beauties that each possessed their own strong points gathered together in that place was a rare and beautiful scene.<br>&ldquo;Actually, it is also the first time that I saw someone reaching a breakthrough to Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I never imagined that one would actually bring forth an abnormal sign,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that can be considered as an abnormal sign. It is merely a special reaction that occurs when one first touches Dragon Mark Immortal-level spirit power. That being said, I must admit that this sort of reaction was somewhat dazzling,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>&ldquo;Right. It&rsquo;s very beautiful,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>Even though the golden light brought forth by her and Chu Lingxi after making their breakthroughs had dissipated, Xia Yun&rsquo;er was still immersed in the joy of having successfully made a breakthrough, and was reminiscing over what had happened earlier.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at the moment when the two girls were chatting with one another, another ripple suddenly emerged from below. Looking down, a faint golden light emerged from the depths of Buried Spirit Lake.<br>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; Seeing that light, Xia Yun&rsquo;er revealed a surprised expression.<br>&ldquo;It seems that Chu Feng has also succeeded in making his breakthrough,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>&ldquo;What did you say? Chu Feng? He&rsquo;s not dead?&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s expression changed enormously upon hearing those words.<br>Chu Lingxi smiledlightly at Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s question. She did not answer her. However, her smile was the best answer to her question.<br>&ldquo;That bastard actually feigned death!&rdquo;<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s beautiful face turned fierce and sinister once again. She flipped her palms, and her two long silver swords appeared in her hands again.<br>At the same time, cyan flames began to engulf her body. Her aura increased from rank four True Immortal to rank five True Immortal.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Abruptly, a loud sound was heard. With dual swords in hands, Xia Yun&rsquo;er brought forth overflowing waves as she dove straight toward the depths of Buried Spirit Lake.<br><br><br>Check out the June Giveaway for a chance to win $200, $100 or $50 Visa Gift Card<br><br><br></p></div>
