        <div> - Confused Looks<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>"This is bad, this Inheritance Cave is going to collapse! Quickly, we must get out of here!"<br>Sensing that the situation was turning bad, Chu Feng shouted loudly. Then, he immediately started flying toward the exit.<br>With the situation being like that, how could there be anyone who would dare hesitate and stay in the Inheritance Cave? They all immediately followed Chu Feng and escaped.<br>When Chu Feng and the others exited the Inheritance Cave, they discovered that it was not only the Inheritance Cave that was collapsing; the area outside the Inheritance Cave was also collapsing.<br>Fortunately, there were a lot of elders present. Thus, a collapse of such a level would not bring any harm to them at all. That said, it remained that the collapse of the Inheritance Cave caused the crowd to sigh with regret. After all, this meant that the Inheritance Site was going to disappear forever.<br>This also served to verify that Chu Feng had indeed obtained the Legacy Inheritance. Otherwise, the Inheritance Cave would not have collapsed.<br>The cause of the collapse was very simple. It was because the Inheritance Cave no longer possessed any treasures or inheritances.<br>......<br>The crowd had all reached the outside. Chu Feng and the other people of the younger generation were once again gathered with Elder Xingyi and the other elders.<br>At that moment, Xia Yun'er was looking at Chu Feng. There was actually a trace of worry in her eyes.<br>She was exceptionally intelligent. Naturally, she knew that the situation was extremely dangerous for Chu Feng at the present moment.<br>As for Zhao Kun and the two Starfall Holy Land's male disciples, they were currently looking at Chu Feng with sneers on their faces. They were waiting for Chu Feng to be punished by Elder Tuoba and the others.<br>"Little friend Chu Feng, it was truly all thanks to you this time around. What you've done has surpassed the responsibility that you were tasked with. I truly do not know how to thank you for all this."<br>"I've decided that I will increase your rewards. You must definitely accept this."<br>Finally, Elder Tuoba spoke. However, the anticipated coldness was not present in his tone. Instead, he actually had an eagerly attentive expression on his face as he handed a Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng.<br>&lsquo;What was going on?&rsquo;<br>At that moment, not to mention the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s disciples, even the Nine Profound Sect&rsquo;s disciples were confused.<br>Even if they were not planning to look further into the matter, there shouldn&rsquo;t be a need for them to present gifts to Chu Feng, no?<br>&lsquo;Could this Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s elder have gone retarded?&rsquo; The disciples from the Nine Profound Sect thought.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, your accomplishments today have truly broadened this old man&rsquo;s horizons. A genius like you is truly rare.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is a bit of my kind intentions. Please consider it as our meeting gift and accept it. You must definitely not decline.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the Nine Profound Sect&rsquo;s silver-haired old man also walked over to Chu Feng with a Cosmos Sack in hand.<br>At that moment, it was no longer only those people of the younger generation that were confused; even Chu feng himself was completely puzzled.<br>Exactly what was going on?<br>Only the elders present knew about what had happened.<br>They all knew very well that they absolutely could not offend Chu Feng again.<br>If they were to offend Chu Feng again, it would not only be their lives on the line; the powers behind them would also have to face at least a single Exalted-level expert.<br>This was the reason why not even that Nine Profound Sect&rsquo;s silver-haired old man had to curry favors with Chu Feng, and even took the initiative to give him gifts.<br>He was doing all this in hopes of turning hostility into friendship.<br>&ldquo;Senior, these gifts&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng subconsciously wanted to decline that Nine Profound Sect&rsquo;s silver-haired old man&rsquo;s gifts. After all, as the saying went, one should not accept undeserved rewards. Chu Feng naturally would not want to accept gifts that were given him for no reason at all.<br>Furthermore, with what had happened earlier, Chu Feng was unable to be certain as to whether or not their gifts were truly given with good intentions.<br>He was unable to be certain as to whether those old monsters were playing some sort of trick still.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, you must absolutely accept these gifts. Else, this old man will refuse to let you leave today,&rdquo; Elder Tuoba said unyieldingly.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I will not allow you to leave either,&rdquo; The Nine Profound Sect&rsquo;s silver-haired old man echoed.<br>At that moment, the Starfall Holy Land and the Nine Profound Sect&rsquo;s disciples looked to one another with confusion. Even Xia Yun&rsquo;er and the two Liangqiu sisters&rsquo; beautiful eyes were filled with puzzlement.<br>Exactly what was going on here? The suppression that they were anticipating did not occur. Instead, the elders started to force Chu Feng to accept their gifts. Furthermore, if Chu Feng refused to accept them, they would not allow him to leave?<br>Exactly what sort of show was this?<br>All of this was simply too unimaginable. This surpassed their ability to comprehend.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, this is the kind regards of your two seniors. You should accept them,&rdquo; Right at that moment, Elder Xingyi spoke.<br>After Elder Xingyi spoke, Chu Feng stopped hesitating. After all, the attitudes of Elder Tuoba and the silver-haired old man were clear. In fact, they even declared that they would not allow him to leave should he refuse to accept their gifts.<br>That said, after Chu Feng accepted the gifts, he grew even more astonished.<br>The Cosmos Sack he obtained from Elder Tuoba was filled with weaponry refinement materials. Although they were only materials for weaponry refinement, they were twice as valuable as the reward that Elder Xingyi had promised Chu Feng.<br>As for the Cosmos Sack from the Nine Profound Sect&rsquo;s silver-haired old man, it was even more amazing. Not only were there cultivation resources, there were also a total of ten Immortal Armaments. Although the quality of those ten Immortal Armaments were not superb, they were very decent quality Immortal Armaments.<br>After Chu Feng accepted their gifts, Elder Tuoba and the Nine Profound Sect&rsquo;s silver-haired old man both bid their farewells. Then, they led their respective men and began to leave. They were actually really letting Chu Feng get away just like that.<br>Furthermore, before they left, Zhao Kuangfengyi also arrived before Chu Feng to present with him a Cosmos Sack as a gift. Although the gifts he prepared were not as extravagant as those of Elder Tuoba and that Nine Profound Sect&rsquo;s silver-haired old man, they were still quality items.<br>Chu Feng would never forget the expression Zhao Kun made when he saw his grandfather presenting gifts to Chu Feng. Zhao Kun reacted as if he had been fed feces. Likely, he was completely stunned. He had definitely never imagined that his grandfather would not only not help him obtain revenge, but instead would present gifts to Chu Feng.<br>Exactly what was going on? Could it be that he was celebrating Chu Feng for teaching his grandson a lesson?<br>Even though he was confused, Zhao Kun did not ask anything. It was only after he left with Zhao Kuangfengyi that he finally asked his grandfather with grievance all over his face, &ldquo;Grandfather, why did you do that? With how that Chu Feng treated me, not only did you not avenge me, you instead presented gifts to him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Kun&rsquo;er, do not make an enemy of Chu Feng anymore. Else, there is likely no one in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm who will be able to save you,&rdquo; Zhao Kuangfengyi said.<br><br><br></p></div>
