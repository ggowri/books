        <h1>Chapter 4227</h1>
        <div> - Ruthless Master<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It took a long while for the All-seeing Heavenly Master to calm down and gather enough strength to stand again.<br>She had been truly terrified by what had happened.<br>Once she got up, she immediately went over to the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, took out a lot of precious treasures and set up a healing formation to treat her master&rsquo;s injuries.<br>She knew very well that her master&rsquo;s condition was very bad. If she didn&rsquo;t promptly treat his injuries, her master could very possibly end up dying.<br>After being treated for a long time, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted finally regained consciousness.<br>&ldquo;Master, how are you feeling?&rdquo; The All-seeing Heavenly Master was overjoyed to see her master awaken.<br>Although his condition was still very bad, just being able to regain his consciousness meant that he would not immediately die. At least, he could still be saved.<br>&ldquo;This Exalted&rsquo;s soul has been seriously injured. I will need to slowly recuperate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As such, it&rsquo;ll be impossible for me to proceed for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.&rdquo;<br>The Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted was filled with regret as he said those words.<br>&ldquo;But master, if you don&rsquo;t go, then wouldn&rsquo;t you be giving everything in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain to others for free?&rdquo;<br>The All-seeing Heavenly Master was very sad.<br>She knew very well how long her master had prepared for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>He had even entered closed-door training all so that he could make a breakthrough, all so that he could smoothly obtain the inheritance in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>Her master had also succeeded in making a breakthrough to rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>Such strength was more than sufficient to show disdain for the entire Holy Light Galaxy. Simply no one would be able to contend against her master.<br>However, simply no one would&rsquo;ve expected that they would've encountered a malignant star at such a crucial moment. Because of that, her master had been seriously injured.<br>&ldquo;Master, it&rsquo;s all this disciple&rsquo;s fault. I was the one that implicated master,&rdquo; the All-seeing Heavenly Master said with guilt.<br>After all, the three mysterious people had come for her. Her master had only been so seriously injured because he had stood up for her.<br>Even though this wasn't what she had wanted, it remained that if it hadn&rsquo;t been for her, her master the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted wouldn&rsquo;t have ended up suffering such serious injuries.<br>&ldquo;What has happened has already happened. Don&rsquo;t overthink things. It is already a massive blessing within a misfortune that this old man was able to survive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, my good disciple, master&rsquo;s injuries are too serious. Not only do I need to recuperate for a long period of time, my injuries also need to be treated promptly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, the only person capable of treating master&rsquo;s illness is you.&rdquo;<br>The Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted&rsquo;s voice was extremely weak. But, he showed no intention of blaming the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>&ldquo;Master, this disciple will give her all to treat master&rsquo;s injuries,&rdquo; guaranteed the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.<br>After saying those words, she began putting forth all her effort to set up a spirit formation to treat her master&rsquo;s injuries.<br>However, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted shook his head. &ldquo;Disciple, you won&rsquo;t be able to help me with only that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master, what should this disciple do then?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master, please instruct me,&rdquo; said the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>Hearing those words, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted gathered all his strength and raised both hands to open up his clothes and reveal his chest.<br>There was a spirit formation on his chest.<br>&ldquo;That is?!&rdquo;<br>The All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s pupils shrank instantly upon seeing the spirit formation. She was actually scared.<br>Although she was unable to tell what sort of spirit formation it was, she could sense that it was strange just by seeing it.<br>&ldquo;Disciple, put your hand on it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My spirit formation will instruct you on what you must do to help me,&rdquo; said the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Master&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The All-seeing Heavenly Master was hesitant.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that she didn&rsquo;t want to help her master. It was simply that the spirit formation was too strange.<br>The spirit formation caused her to feel great unease.<br>&ldquo;Disciple, master was injured because of you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you planning to refuse to help your master treat his injuries?&rdquo; asked the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Master, it is all thanks to your nurturing that this disciple was able to gain her current standing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This disciple would not go against master&rsquo;s desire.&rdquo;<br>After saying that, All-seeing Heavenly Master extended her arm and placed her hand on the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted&rsquo;s chest.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>Once her palm landed on the spirit formation, the spirit formation emitted dark-red light.<br>At the same time, terrifying screams that sounded like evil spirits seeking lives resonated through the surrounding region.<br>The All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s complexion changed enormously. She began screaming in miserable pain.<br>&ldquo;Master, please spare this disciple.&rdquo;<br>The All-seeing Heavenly Master was struggling violently. She wanted to remove her hand.<br>But, her struggling was completely futile.<br>The benevolent expression had disappeared from the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted's eyes. Instead, an intense look of ruthlessness had taken its place.<br>&ldquo;You useless trash. Apart from stirring up trouble, all you&rsquo;re capable of is inviting disasters.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man has prepared for that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain for many years. Yet, because of the trouble you&rsquo;ve caused, I am unable to go there. Today, I shall use your life to heal my injuries.&rdquo;<br>After the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted said those words, the strange screaming voices grew even louder, and the dark-red light became even more intense.<br>In contrast, the All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s screams started to gradually weaken.<br>Finally, the red light dissipated, and the voices were no longer present. With a &lsquo;putt,&rsquo; the All-seeing Heavenly Master fell onto the ground.<br>The All-seeing Heavenly Master had been reduced to a dried-up corpse. Not only had she been mutilated beyond recognition, she was also devoid of any signs of life.<br>As for the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, his complexion had grown much better.<br>However, even though he was no longer as weak as before, one could still tell that he was seriously injured.<br>Nevertheless, he stood up and soared into the sky.<br>However, right after flying into the air, he crashed to the ground again.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! Must this old man really miss out on this opportunity?!&rdquo;<br>Unreconciliation filled the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted&rsquo;s face.<br>&hellip;...<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain was actually located in a relatively desolate place.<br>It was in a certain Starfield&rsquo;s Lower Realm.<br>No one knew why such a powerful remnant would be hidden in such a place.<br>However, because of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain, that Lower Realm had undergone a complete upheaval.<br>Powerful world spiritists from throughout the Holy Light Galaxy would frequently visit that Lower Realm. Some even had even begun staying there long-term.<br>At that moment, that Lower Realm was particularly lively.<br>Even the legendary powerful world spiritists that had been in closed-door training had appeared.<br>The reason for that was because the day of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain&rsquo;s opening, was quickly approaching.<br></p></div>
