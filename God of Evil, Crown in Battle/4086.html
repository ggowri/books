        <h1>Chapter 4085</h1>
        <div> - Rank Two Exalted Taboo<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;How could this be?!&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all stunned upon seeing this scene.<br>That was no ordinary rank nine Immortal Technique. Instead, it was a mastered rank nine Immortal Technique with a power approaching an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.<br>Yet, an Immortal Technique this powerful was actually easily obliterated by that enormous dragon.<br>This made the crowd realize one thing.<br>They seemed to have underestimated Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what sort of pleasant surprise will that youngster bring us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could there be such a powerful monster in this world?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve broadened my horizons. I&rsquo;ve truly broadened my horizons today. This trip has truly been worthwhile.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, many people were shouting like that.<br>They were endlessly excited, and filled with so much emotion that their voices were trembling.<br>They all felt that they had witnessed the birth of a genius.<br>It was very possible that a genius like Chu Feng would be the strongest genius that they&rsquo;d witnessed in their entire life.<br>They even felt that they were witnessing the birth of a legend.<br>A genius of this caliber would most definitely be able to make a name for himself in the Holy Light Galaxy. He would most definitely be able to leave behind a legend of his own.<br>Chu Feng did not belong in the Abandoned Starfields. In fact, he did not belong in the Lower Starfields.<br>Practically everyone felt that he was someone whose name could become renowned in the entire Holy Light Galaxy.<br>&ldquo;This guy&hellip;&rdquo;<br>While the others were feeling joyous at the sight of Chu Feng&rsquo;s might, the people from the Constellation Immortal Isle looked miserable.<br>As matters stood, they had to admit that this young man from the Chu Heavenly Clan was a monster.<br>Yet, it just so happened that a monster like that was their enemy.<br>This brought them enormous fear.<br>In fact, seeing the current Chu Feng, even the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master narrowed his brows.<br>He had thought that his rank nine Immortal Technique would be able to defeat Chu Feng.<br>Never did he expect that his rank nine Immortal Technique would not be able to withstand a single attack from Chu Feng.<br>When he saw that bright and life-like dragon coiling around Chu Feng like a guardian, he realized that his battle power was stronger than he had imagined.<br>&ldquo;Interesting.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a look of determination appeared in the eyes of the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>Then, he tossed his Incomplete Exalted Armament into the sky.<br>Reaching the sky, the Incomplete Exalted Armament suddenly changed.<br>As if it had released its own innate ability, Chu Feng could sense that the Incomplete Exalted Armament was unleashing its own oppressive might.<br>The being within the Incomplete Exalted Armament had awakened!<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, swoosh~~~&rdquo;<br>The Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master overlayed his hands and formed multiple hand seals.<br>His body also began to change.<br>It was just that Chu Feng was unable to determine what sort of change it was.<br>Suddenly, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master opened his mouth.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Purple lightning shot out from his mouth.<br>Once the purple lightning emerged from his mouth, it actually moved toward the Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>The lightning coiled around the Incomplete Exalted Armament, and caused it to transform again.<br>With the Incomplete Exalted Armament as the foundation, a giant purple dragon rose forth.<br>This giant purple lightning dragon was actually also tens of thousands of meters long. Furthermore, the might it was emitting was even stronger than Chu Feng&rsquo;s giant golden dragon.<br>Standing behind the giant dragon, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master appeared far inferior to it.<br>&ldquo;That is the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s strongest technique, the rank two Exalted Taboo: Purple Lightning Attachment!&rdquo;<br>Someone recognized the origin of the purple lightning.<br>It turned out that it was the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Protection Martial Skill, their strongest martial skill.<br>The Exalted Taboo: Purple Lightning Attachment was originally a martial skill to attach to one&rsquo;s body like armor that greatly increased both the offense and defense of its user.<br>However, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master had attached it to his Incomplete Exalted Armament instead.<br>Incomplete Exalted Armaments were living weapons to begin with.<br>Because of that, the Exalted Taboo: Purple Lightning Attachment was able to greatly strengthen the power of his Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>Back then, the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had relied on precisely this Exalted Taboo: Purple Lightning Attachment to defeat the six overlords.<br>His usage of the Exalted Taboo: Purple Lightning Attachment meant that he was serious.<br>This was his strongest technique. If he failed to defeat Chu Feng even with this, it would mean that he was no match for him.<br>&ldquo;Will Chu Feng be able to take on that attack?&rdquo;<br>This question appeared in the minds of the crowd. At the same time, they were all deeply looking forward to what was about to happen<br>To the majority of the crowd, this battle had nothing to do with them.<br>That said, after having witnessed the battle, many of them hoped for Chu Feng&rsquo;s victory.<br>After all, this was a battle concerning life and death.<br>As the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master was the person who had committed a wrong first, his death would be justified.<br>The death of Chu Feng, on the other hand, would represent the fall of an exceptional genius.<br>&hellip;...<br>Inside the Purple Star Variance Realm. Chu Feng was also observing that enormous lightning dragon.<br>When the enormous lightning dragon took form completely, the sky above Chu Feng&rsquo;s head had changed.<br>While the shining golden dragon Chu Feng had formed with his world spirit techniques was life-like and incomparably divine, its might didn't seem to be a match for that enormous lightning dragon.<br>After the giant lightning dragon appeared, the sky was not only covered densely with dark clouds, but purple lightning was also flickering between them.<br>Chu Feng could sense the might of the dragon.<br>This Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master was indeed someone with some skills.<br>&ldquo;World spirit techniques are nothing more than tricks.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is martial power that is real.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Weak is weak and strong is strong, martial power will not lie.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Else, this world would not be known as the vast cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you really think that you&rsquo;d be able to defeat this old man just because you possess outstanding world spirit techniques?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, this old man will have you realize that no matter how powerful your world spirit techniques might be, you&rsquo;ll still not be able to contend against martial cultivators.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;World spiritists will forever be unable to surpass martial cultivators.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the end, this world is a world where martial cultivators rule.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;World spiritists like you only play a minor role.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master let out a loud shout and sent his palms forward.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>The enormous lightning dragon opened its ferocious mouth wide and roared nonstop as it rushed toward Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng was not to be outdone. With a single thought, the giant dragon of light that coiled around him also rushed forth to confront the incoming lightning dragon.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Dragon roars sounded nonstop as violent winds blew away the clouds. The two enormous dragons collided.<br>The entire region was covered by purple lightning and dazzling light.<br>A scene that shocked everyone occurred.<br>The purple lightning was gradually weakening, whereas the light was growing more and more vigorous.<br>Soon, some experts managed to realize what was going on.<br>Although the two enormous dragons were locked in battle, it was Chu Feng&rsquo;s giant dragon of light that was winning.<br>Like two real dragons, the two giant dragons were fighting in the sky in the most primitive manner.<br>The lightning dragon was not only overwhelmingly powerful, but its attacks were also extremely fierce. Yet, all of its attacks were dodged by the giant light dragon.<br>It was instead the light dragons&rsquo;s talons and fangs that managed to strike down at the lightning dragon&rsquo;s body repeatedly.<br>Because of that, the lightning dragon&rsquo;s scales were falling off repeatedly, and its aura was growing weaker by the second.<br></p></div>
