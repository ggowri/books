        <h1>Chapter 3146</h1>
        <div> - Devil Incarnate<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Fengming, shut up!&rdquo; Qingyu Dong did not have the intention to take care of Chu Feng for Qingyu Fengming.<br>After he shouted down Qingyu Fengming, he looked to Chu Feng.<br>However, before Qingyu Dong could say anything, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;I know what you want to say. Thus, you don&rsquo;t have to bother wasting your time saying those words to me. Today, I, Chu Feng, will definitely punish Qingyu Fengming. Otherwise&hellip; I am unable to take account for my big sis Shuangshuang.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Shuangshuang&rsquo;s heart tightened.<br>Even though she felt extremely wronged after being tortured by Qingyu Fengming, she did not wish for Chu Feng to offend an enormous power like the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan just because of her.<br>Thus, she wanted to tell Chu Feng to drop the matter, that there was no need to pursue the matter further.<br>However, when Chu Shuangshuang planned to open her mouth, she was surprised to discover that she was unable to speak.<br>It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng had already restricted her using his oppressive might, refusing to allow her to speak or make any movements to prevent him from doing what he wanted to do. Chu Shuangshuang was only able to stand there as an onlooker.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, there are multiple ways to solve a problem.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you really planning to get revenge by giving someone a taste of their own medicine?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Qingyu Dong turned his eyes to Chu Shuangshuang.<br>He knew that it would be very difficult to persuade Chu Feng, whereas it would be much easier to persuade Chu Shuangshuang.<br>However, to his surprise, not only did Chu Shuangshuang not answer him, but her expression also did not change. It was as if she did not want to pay attention to him. This caused Qingyu Dong to frown.<br>He truly did not expect for the clansmen of the Chu Heavenly Clan, a power that did not have any strength in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, to have such courage.<br>Of course, he had no idea that that Chu Shuangshuang actually wanted to answer him. Merely, she was incapable of speaking.<br>&ldquo;Qingyu Dong, I do not wish to waste time speaking with you. I will only tell you this. Although not all of you attacked my big sis Shuangshuang, you are all akin to accomplices for not helping her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I will take your decent attitude into consideration and not look further into the matter. That said, Qingyu Fengming must pay for what he has done.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will only ask you one thing: are you really planning to obstruct me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, I truly do not wish to become your enemy. However, Fengming is my younger brother of the same clan. We are relatives of the same blood. As such, I cannot disregard him,&rdquo; Qingyu Dong said.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, I will apologize for my offense beforehand,&rdquo; as Chu Feng spoke, he took out an Immortal Armament from his Cosmos Sack.<br>Once Chu Feng held the Immortal Armament in his hand, he gained another level of heaven-defying battle power.<br>Relying on the power of the Divine level Lightning Mark, the fusion with his secret skills and the Immortal Armament, Chu Feng was not only a rank nine Heavenly Immortal, but he also gained heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting two levels of cultivation.<br>Being this powerful, not to mention Qingyu Dong without unleashing the power of his bloodline, Qingyu Dong would not be able to contend against Chu Feng even if he were to unleash his bloodline power.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, you actually!!!&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing that Chu Feng was capable of using an Immortal Armament, Qingyu Dong&rsquo;s expression immediately changed. Endless astonishment filled his eyes.<br>Although he already knew that Chu Feng was no simple character, no one had mentioned to him that he actually possessed such an ability.<br>Although he discovered it now, it was already too late.<br>The reason for that was because when Qingyu Dong realized that the situation was bad, Chu Feng&rsquo;s oppressive might had already reached him and completely enveloped him.<br>&ldquo;Putt,&rdquo; Qingyu Dong was forcibly suppressed to the ground by Chu Feng&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>However, Qingyu Dong&rsquo;s situation was different from Qingyu Fengming, who was forced onto his stomach.<br>Chu Feng was being courteous with Qingyu Dong, and had only forced him to sit on the ground. He did not cause any injury or insult to him.<br>&ldquo;People of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, watch carefully. In the future, if you all are to encounter people from our Chu Heavenly Clan, you&rsquo;d best consider things properly first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If any of you dare to be disrespectful toward the people of our Chu Heavenly Clan, you will end up like this Qingyu Fengming.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng waved his sleeve.<br>&ldquo;Ji, ji, ji, ji~~~&rdquo;<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>&hellip;...<br>...<br>In the next moment, the countless black bugs began to swarm Qingyu Fengming.<br>In the blink of an eye, those black bugs covered Qingyu Fengming completely.<br>The crowd were able to, through their various observational abilities, see those bugs tearing through Qingyu Fengming&rsquo;s flesh and boring into his body. They were nibbling away at his flesh, eating his bones and tearing at his soul.<br>&ldquo;Eaaahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bastard!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Stop! Stop immediately! No!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Qingyu Fengming&rsquo;s screams began to rise and fall in succession. His screams were heart-tearing and lung-splitting. It was as if he were enduring inhumane torture.<br>Actually, inhumane torture was precisely what he was experiencing.<br>Furthermore, compared to the torture that Qingyu Fengming had used on Chu Shuangshuang, Chu Feng&rsquo;s torture of Qingyu Fengming was even more cruel and inhumane.<br>Cruel, it was extremely cruel. Qingyu Fengming was truly extremely miserable at that moment.<br>He was in so much misery that the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan did not even have the heart to continue to watch his torture.<br>However, no one dared to say anything.<br>They had already witnessed what sort of person Chu Feng was.<br>He was completely fearless. He simply did not care what sort of power their Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan possessed in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>Faced with a devil incarnate-like existence like Chu Feng, they did not dare to plea for leniency for Qingyu Fengming. They were deeply afraid that they would experience the same fate as Qingyu Fengming should they plead for him.<br></p></div>
