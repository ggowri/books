        <h1>Chapter 4960</h1>
        <div>: An Overpowered Formation Using the Lives of the Entire Clan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, in view that you&rsquo;re a renowned world spiritist clan, I can overlook your earlier impertinence and give you another chance. As long as you hand over what I&rsquo;ve demanded, I&rsquo;ll allow you to leave,&rdquo; the Wretched Black Demon said.<br>&ldquo;Wretched Black Demon, you really shouldn&rsquo;t look down on me,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief replied.<br>With a furious roar, spirit power started gushing out from his severed arm. A formation quickly formed around his arm before the two vanished simultaneously.<br>The next moment, the severed arm reappeared on the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s body. He whipped out a new Exalted Armament, allowing him to quickly regain his fighting prowess. He gathered his martial power before charging at the Wretched Black Demon once more.<br>This time, he executed a particularly powerful Exalted Taboo. Flames covered the sky, and one could vaguely hear the war cries from thousands of soldiers. Its might was as imposing as its appearance.<br>It rushed toward the Wretched Black Demon with an astounding momentum.<br>At the same time, those from the Zhuge Clan, under the lead of the elders, turned around and fled. They channeled their floating warships to escape in the direction where they came from.<br>They were fleeing!<br>It was all planned beforehand.<br>The Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief knew from the start that he wasn&rsquo;t a match for the Wretched Black Demon. He was intentionally hiding the Wretched Black Demon&rsquo;s vision so as to give his clan members a chance at escaping.<br>However, there was a sharp glint in the vicious eyes of the Wretched Black Demon. It was a unique discernment means that allowed him to see through all impediments.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Despite having seen through everything, the Wretched Black Demon chose to turn a blind eye to it. He let out a cold sneer as he continued trading blows with the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Those from the Zhuge Clan thought that their clan chief had successfully stopped the Wretched Black Demon, but it turned out that they were being too hopeful.<br>Boom!<br>There was a loud explosion, and smithereens fell from the sky. The frontmost floating warship appeared to have bumped into something, resulting in it being smashed into smithereens. Yet, there was clearly nothing in front of it at all.<br>Nevertheless, the wary members of the Zhuge Clan still quickly halted their movements.<br>At the same time, a barrier appeared in front of the area where the floating warship was destroyed. It initially covered a small area, but it swiftly expanded into a massive barrier that spanned over tens of thousands of meters.<br>It was strong and indestructible, but more importantly, it had been there all along. Someone had constructed it in advance.<br>Without a doubt, it was the Wretched Black Demon&rsquo;s doing. He had already sealed off their path of escape right from the start.<br>Seeing that it was impossible to escape, the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief stopped his charge and quickly backed away. He looked at the Wretched Black Demon with cold eyes and said, &ldquo;Wretched Black Demon, do you have to drive our Zhuge Clan up the corner?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, I&rsquo;ve already said that I&rsquo;d allow you to leave as long as you hand over what I want,&rdquo; the Wretched Black Demon said.<br>&ldquo;Do you think that I would believe your nonsense? You&rsquo;re not the type to leave behind any potential threats. Since you have already made a move, there&rsquo;s no way you would allow us to leave,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha!&rdquo;<br>The Wretched Black Demon burst into hearty laughter.<br>When he finally reined in his laughter, cold killing intent flared from his body, sealing off the surroundings.<br>&ldquo;Why bother asking when you already know? Well, if you hand over what I want, I&rsquo;ll at least leave the members of your Zhuge Clan with whole corpses,&rdquo; the Wretched Black Demon said.<br>Hearing those words, the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief steeled in determination. He released his Exalted Armament and released his spirit power, but his spirit power was a little peculiar. It rose from his body like blazing flames.<br>&ldquo;Wretched Black Demon, you&rsquo;ll regret your actions today,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spat through gritted teeth.<br>&ldquo;Members of the Zhuge Clan, construct formation!&rdquo;<br>His blazing spirit power erupted from his body like a volcano.<br>&ldquo;Activate!&rdquo;<br>The members of the Zhuge Clan started setting up a formation. It was worth noting that their spirit power were all set ablaze too. Those from the older generation were still able to withstand it, but the juniors revealed looks of pain as soon as their spirit power started burning up. Some of them even started aging swiftly.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re burning your life force to fight against me? You might have stood a chance if I was still at rank eight Dragon Transformation Sensation, but unfortunately for you, I have already reached rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation. Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, have you lost your wits or are you just desperate?&rdquo; the Wretched Black Demon said.<br>He showed no signs of stopping the latter at all.<br>Even though the prowess amassed by the members of the Zhuge Clan was formidable, the Wretched Black Demon didn&rsquo;t think much of it. Disdain could be seen in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Combine!&rdquo;<br>The Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief roared.<br>Their blazing spirit power morphed into pillars of light that converged above them, forming a terrifying blood-red formation. It emanated the stench of blood.<br>Catching a whiff of the blood stench, the Wretched Black Demon looked at the pained expressions of the members of the Zhuge Clan. Even though they were setting up formations, it looked more as if their souls were being sucked dry. A frown formed on his forehead.<br>&ldquo;Burning your blood? You&rsquo;re really intending to pit your life against me?&rdquo;<br>However, the frown swiftly loosened, replaced with a smile of ridicule.<br>&ldquo;Interesting. Since that&rsquo;s the case, let me see how powerful a formation you desperately constructed in your final moments will be!&rdquo;<br>With a cold sneer, the Wretched Black Demon released a burst of spirit power that covered his surroundings. He was prepared to receive the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s desperate final struggle.<br>Whoosh!<br>The blood-red spirit power enveloped the surroundings amidst a screeching howl, making it appear as the world was burning up. Finally, the formation that the Zhuge Clan had desperately constructed at the cost of their lives was completed.<br>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;<br>It was just that the outcome was different from what the Wretched Black Demon had expected.<br>Instead of going at the Wretched Black Demon, the formation struck someone within the Zhuge Clan instead. To be more exact, it was directed toward Zhuge Feiluan.<br>The formation constructed by the Zhuge Clan at the expense of their lives had fallen upon Zhuge Feiluan, a junior of the Zhuge Clan. It generated energy that transported him safely out of the area.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>The eyes of the Wretched Black Demon turned vicious. He quickly formed a hand seal with his right hand before waving his sleeves.<br>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!<br>His spirit power morphed into countless blades that tore through the members of the Zhuge Clan. Fresh blood spurted everywhere as the members of the Zhuge Clan were severed into two, losing their lives.<br>Regardless of gender or age, all members of the Zhuge Clan were sliced apart before falling from the sky. It was a terrifying and depressing sight.<br>Even the small portion of people who were fortunate enough not to be sliced by the blades plummeted to the ground and fell completely still. On closer look, their bodies had dried up, and their auras were withered.<br>They were all doomed to die regardless of whether the blades struck them or not.<br>There was only a single man left floating in the sky, and that was the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. He was in an extremely feeble state.<br>&ldquo;I have miscalculated. I never thought that it would be a teleportation formation. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, the treasure must be on him, right?&rdquo; the Wretched Black Demon said as he began making his way toward the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Kill me. I&rsquo;m not afraid. Feiluan will avenge us all,&rdquo; the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>Despite his feeble voice, he looked at the Wretched Black Demon with a smug look. He knew that there was no chance of him surviving this ordeal, so dying no longer frightened him.<br>&ldquo;Do you think that I would be afraid of a mere junior? It goes without saying that I have no plans of letting you off.&rdquo;<br>The Wretched Black Demon plunged his hand into the chest of the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Gah!<br>The Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief let out a cry of agony.<br>The Wretched Black Demon looked at the suffering Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief with vicious eyes.<br>&ldquo;Old thing, playing tricks with me? I won&rsquo;t let you die an easy death.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
