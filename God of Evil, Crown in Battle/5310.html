        <h1>Chapter 5311</h1>
        <div>: Chu Feng Makes an Appearance<br>&ldquo;Backed out?&rdquo; Chu Feng was baffled.<br>&ldquo;Yeap! He took the Ancestral Ritual, but he said that his cultivation was too weak for the later tests, so he backed out,&rdquo; Little Crescent said.<br>&ldquo;In other words, he left just like that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yeap yeap! We didn&rsquo;t think much about it at the start since he was really weak. Later on, we realized that there was a chance that he could have cleared the later tests. He was very, very talented, and there&rsquo;s no rule saying that only strong cultivators can clear our tests. Ey, uncle has always thought that it was a huge regret. Speaking of which, big brother, you do look a little like Chu Xuanyan. No, it&rsquo;s not just a little. You look more and more like him!&rdquo;<br>Little Crescent&rsquo;s eyes alternated between Chu Feng and the portrait in her hands.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, do you really not know Chu Xuanyan?&rdquo; Little Crescent asked.<br>Chu Feng shook his head. He had chosen not to tell Little Crescent the truth out of worry that she would run her mouth. After all, she was still a child. Furthermore, he thought that there was something suspicious about how the events unfolded.<br>His father must have come to the Ancient Realm for the benefits it offered, but why would he leave right after the Ancestral Ritual then? There had to be a reason for that. Until he got to the bottom of the matter, he didn&rsquo;t want anyone to know that he was Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son.<br>On top of that, the Ancient Realm was clearly not a peaceful land.<br>&ldquo;Why are your people so concerned about that test?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Our people have been trapped in the Ancient Realm for a long time. We thought that because that test was so special, our people might be freed if someone clears it. But I think that they are thinking too much into it. Why would our Ancient Realm be freed over an outsider? Sometimes, I wonder why are adults so dumb. Don&rsquo;t you agree with me, big brother?&rdquo; Little Crescent looked at Chu Feng with a gleeful smile.<br>Little Crescent was a talkative person, but she was a very charming individual. She was much more mature than her peers, but at the same time, she still retained her childlike innocence. Chu Feng was very fond of her.<br>&hellip;<br>Following the arrival of the challengers, a huge crowd had gathered at the square in the middle of the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s main city.<br>Be it the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Zhou Dong, the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s Qin Shu, the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s Jia Chengying, Bai Yunqing, or the others who cleared the first test, all of them had already arrived at the square.<br>They knew that the massive stone monument on the square was where they were going to have their talents assessed. They had also heard about Chu Xuanyan&rsquo;s affairs by now. How could they not be curious about Chu Xuanyan when his name was inscribed on the massive stone monument? The matter wasn&rsquo;t a secret in the Ancient Realm anyway.<br>&ldquo;How intriguing. An Exalted level cultivator was actually able to leave his name on that stone monument?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing remarked.<br>&ldquo;You need not think too much into it, Brother Bai. Now that we&rsquo;re here, our names are going to replace Chu Xuanyan&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Jia Chengying said confidently..<br>Bai Yunqing smiled upon hearing those words.<br>It was a known fact that the juniors from eight hundred years ago were not as strong as the juniors of the current generation, not to mention that they were the cream of the crop. That was also where their confidence stemmed from.<br>Just then, the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief descended from the sky together with the white-haired woman.<br>Bai Yunqing and the others narrowed their eyes at the sight of the white-haired woman. Jia Chengying, who was defeated by the white-haired woman in the Trial of the Strongest, widened his eyes in shock.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, allow me to introduce Miss Bai to you. She has cleared the second test of our Ancient Realm, so she&rsquo;ll be proceeding straight ahead to the final test. However, she&rsquo;ll still have to undergo the talent assessment later on,&rdquo; the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief said.<br>&ldquo;She cleared the second test?&rdquo;<br>Zhou Dong, Qin Shu, Jia Chengying, Bai Yunqing, and the others were shocked to hear that. They looked at the white-haired woman in a new light.<br>On the one hand, they didn&rsquo;t discover the white-haired woman earlier and didn&rsquo;t know that she had entered the red gate. On the other hand, Jia Chengying and the others had approached the red gate earlier, only to retreat out of fear.<br>Who could have thought that the white-haired woman would clear the test that had scared them off? Could the red gate just be an empty scare, and the test wasn&rsquo;t as scary as they had imagined?<br>&ldquo;Lord Chief, did no one emerge from the fourth gate?&rdquo; Jia Chengying asked.<br>That was the gate his younger brother, Jia Chengxiong, had entered. Naturally, he hoped that his younger brother could defeat Chu Feng and enter the Ancient Realm.<br>&ldquo;Someone did emerge from the fourth gate. It is young hero Chu Feng,&rdquo; the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Jia Chengying clenched his fists. He was angry at how Chu Feng chose to compete with his younger brother when he could have easily emerged victorious in any of the other gates. As a result, his younger brother missed the chance to enter the Ancient Realm.<br>Meanwhile, the others weren&rsquo;t too surprised to hear the news.<br>Chu Feng was the victor of the Trial of the Strongest&rsquo;s late Martial Exalted level category, after all. There was no question about his capability. While he was unable to compete with the likes of Jia Chengying and the others, he shouldn&rsquo;t have any difficulty defeating Jia Chengxiong.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chief, is the Chu Feng who entered the Ancient Realm the same person who won the Trial of the Strongest&rsquo;s late Martial Exalted level category?&rdquo; a junior of the Ancient Realm asked.<br>Many juniors revealed looks of admiration upon hearing those words, especially the women.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Young hero Chu Feng did win the Totem Galaxy&rsquo;s Trial of the Strongest not too long ago,&rdquo; the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief replied.<br>&ldquo;Waaa, Chu Feng is here too! If I remember correctly, he wasn&rsquo;t on the invitation list. Did he come on his own accord?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re actually able to meet the strongest Martial Exalted level cultivator of the Totem Galaxy! How exciting!&rdquo;<br>The people of the Ancient Realm were excited upon the confirmation of Chu Feng&rsquo;s identity.<br>&ldquo;Is there a need to get so excited over a mere Martial Exalted level cultivator?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing was baffled.<br>Compared to the people gathered here, the strongest Martial Exalted level cultivator meant nothing at all. Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to put up a fight against them. Bai Yunqing couldn&rsquo;t understand why the people of the Ancient Realm respected Chu Feng so much.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Bai, this is the tradition of our Ancient Realm. To us, a person&rsquo;s true strength is much more important than their reputation. We recognize young hero Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength because he won fair and square in the intense tournament held by the Totem Dragon Clan. You&rsquo;ll also become the idol of our juniors if you defeat young hero Chu Feng in the subsequent tests,&rdquo; an elder standing behind Bai Yunqing told him via voice transmission.<br>The elder was the leader of the tribe Bai Yunqing had bound with. Their tribe would receive benefits if Bai Yunqing successfully cleared the Ancestral Ritual.<br>With the exception of the white-haired woman, Zhou Dong, Qin Shu, Jia Chengying, and the others had also bound themselves to different tribes. They were accompanied by the leaders of the respective tribes they were bound with.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chief, when is young hero Chu Feng arriving? Which tribe was he transported to?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Indeed, which tribe was he transported to? Our tribe didn&rsquo;t see him.&rdquo;<br>Some of the tribal leaders spoke up.<br>There were more than thirty tribes in the Ancient Realm but only eleven challengers. Nine of the challengers had already been bound to a tribe, and the white-haired woman was definitely going to be bound with the chief. If the remaining tribes wanted to bind with a challenger, Chu Feng was their only hope.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng was transported to a more remote location. He might not be able to make it in time for the talent assessment,&rdquo; the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief said.<br>&ldquo;Ah? He won&rsquo;t be able to make it?&rdquo; The tribal leaders were disappointed to hear that.<br>While Bai Yunqing, Jia Chengying, and the others were overjoyed to hear that, the white-haired woman was surprised. She turned to the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief and said, &ldquo;Lord Chief, why won&rsquo;t Chu Feng be able to make it in time? Can&rsquo;t you send someone to bring him here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Miss Bai, this is the rule set by our Ancestral Idol. We can only follow it,&rdquo; the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief said.<br>The white-haired woman thought that there was something suspicious going on and wanted to stand up for Chu Feng, but she couldn&rsquo;t refute the words of the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief. As a matter of fact, she did know a thing or two about the Ancient Realm, which was why she understood that the rules of the Ancestral Idol were laws in the Ancient Realm.<br>Just then, an elder swooped into the field and announced, &ldquo;Lord Chief, Chu Feng is here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is here? He managed to find his way here?&rdquo; The Ancient Realm&rsquo;s chief was surprised.<br>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s about to arrive,&rdquo; the elder replied.<br>The crowd turned their sights toward the sky. Moments later, before everyone&rsquo;s eyes, Chu Feng descended into the square while holding onto Little Crescent&rsquo;s hand.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is here!&rdquo;<br>The Ancient Realm&rsquo;s crowd was excited.<br></div>
