        <h1>Chapter 4290</h1>
        <div> - The Whole Story<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart trembled.<br>His emotions were completely vivid on his face.<br>Misty Peak was located in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm&rsquo;s Eastern Sea Region. It was the most miraculous location in the Eastern Sea Region.<br>The reason for that was because the Misty Peak contained creatures from the Ancient Era and mysterious powers.<br>The beings here and the powers of this place had caused Chu Feng to feel himself to be extremely small at once point.<br>He felt like he was unworthy of mention, like he was a speck of dust...<br>But, after Chu Feng exited the Lower Realms and entered the Ordinary Realms and then the Upper Realms...<br>In his journey, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation had grown much stronger than before.<br>Returning to the Lower Realms, it would not be excessive to say that his power would be akin to a god.<br>He had thought that, with his current level of cultivation, even if he cannot see through the Misty Peak&rsquo;s ancient region upon his return, he will at least be able to take on the beings here.<br>He even felt that the creatures here would not be a match for him.<br>Yet now, standing at this place and looking at the surroundings, seeing the white bones that filled the ground and sensing the aura of this region, even though not a single one of those creatures from back then showed themselves before him, Chu Feng was already certain of one thing -- he was still very weak, still very small.<br>Being here, he was still so incomparably small and weak.<br>&ldquo;Huuu---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the clouds began to sweep forth in the sky above. Gradually, a giant face appeared.<br>The giant eyes that were capable of piercing through everything looked down upon Chu Feng from above.<br>&ldquo;Brat, do you still remember this Exalted?&rdquo;<br>The deep and resounding voice that was capable of shaking one&rsquo;s soul, that god-like voice, sounded from the sky.<br>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior had helped this junior back then,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>What Chu Feng experienced in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm back then left a profound impression on Chu Feng.<br>And, in that Martial Marking Immortal Realm, what gave Chu Feng the most profound impression was this existence that covered the vast sky.<br>The oppressive sensation brought forth upon Chu Feng by this being was much stronger than any of the other terrifying creatures.<br>And, most astonishing of all, that oppressive sensation remained the same even now.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation increase seemed to be completely meaningless before this being.<br>&ldquo;The transformation to Yan Ruyu, Ya Fei and Murong Wan was caused by this Exalted.&rdquo;<br>The terrifying giant face entered the main subject at once.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what&hellip; had you done to them?&rdquo;<br>Although still curious, Chu Feng was no longer that worried.<br>While this enormous face appeared terrifying, Chu Feng had an excellent impression toward it.<br>To Chu Feng, it was not something evil.<br>Since this matter was done by it, Chu Feng felt that there should not be any danger to Murong Wan, Ya Fei and Yan Ruyu.<br>&ldquo;Being in this place, this Exalted was simply too bored.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is why the Misty Peak, Martial Marking Immortal Realm and the Temple of Reproduction exist.&rdquo;<br>That being&rsquo;s voice sounded from the sky again.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng had a rough idea.<br>This being should be the existence truly in control over the Misty Peak.<br>The experiences of the Misty peak and some of their remnants were merely created by it because it was too bored.<br>They were nothing more than puzzles for the younger generations of the Easetern Sea Region to solve. As for this existence, it will enjoy the entertainment brought forth by those people from the viewpoint of a god.<br>But, for this existence to say those things to Chu Feng, it was clearly indirectly implying something.<br>Chu Feng quickly realized something.<br>&ldquo;Senior, could it be it&rsquo;s also because you were too bored that you ended up changing Yan Ruyu, Murong Wan and Ya Fei?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You can say that. But, that&rsquo;s not the entire reason.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What do you think of their living conditions inside the Galewind Hunting Clan? Was it bad?&rdquo;<br>That existence did not directly answer Chu Feng. Instead, it asked him a question.<br>Bad? Of course not.<br>They were deemed as princesses of the Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s Royal Clan. Their status were extremely noble.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng noticed in his previous interaction with the Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the person so powerful that he cannot assess his strength, that when he mentioned Yan Ruyu, Murong Wan and Ya Fei, he also addressed them as Her Highnesses.<br>It was as if he, the Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, was not the person with the highest status within the Galewind Hunting Clan. Instead, it was Ya Fei, Yan Ruyu and Murong Wan.<br>Furthermore, the respect he had toward them does not seem to be a disguise.<br>&ldquo;Their conditions are not at all bad. It&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Before Chu Feng could finish his words, the voice sounded from the sky again.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re not themselves?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truth is, the reason for their current status within the Galewind Hunting Clan is not only because this Exalted had sent them there. It&rsquo;s also because they&rsquo;ve undergone an intrinsic metamorphosis.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Strictly speaking, the three of them could be considered as half disciples of this Exalted,&rdquo; said that existence.<br>&ldquo;Half disciples?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt very surprised to hear those words.<br>To Chu Feng, the Galewind Hunting Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s strength was already very terrifying.<br>But, when compared to this existence, there was undoubtedly a major disparity in strength.<br>Even though this existence had never unleashed its oppressive might at Chu Feng, it was so powerful that Chu Feng could sense that it was extremely powerful just with it appearing before Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng believed this existence to be someone capable of dictating everything and bringing ruin upon everything.<br>The oppressive sensation it brought forth was reminding Chu Feng how small and weak he was the entire time.<br>This being could be said to be the most terrifying existence Chu Feng had ever encountered, the being closest to god.<br>If Yan Ruyu, Murong Wan and Ya Fei were really able to become this being&rsquo;s disciples, oh how enormously fortunate were they?<br>&ldquo;This Exalted will not really teach them anything. But, they&rsquo;ve obtained some powers granted to them by this Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They are no longer mediocre. Their transformation was bestowed by this Exalted. As such, they are naturally able to be considered as half disciples of mine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, the powers I bestowed them have yet to awaken. If they wanted to awaken those powers, they needed guidance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, this Exalted do not wish to waste too much of my time with them. That is why I handed them over to the Galewind Hunting Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, as the Galewind Hunting Clan is a race from the Ancient Era, it wouldn&rsquo;t be very suitable for them to nurture three humans.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is why I erased their memories and transformed their appearances to that of Galewind Hunting Clansmen. It is so that they could integrate with the Galewind Hunting Clan better.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, taking you into consideration, this Exalted is able to allow them to regain their original memories.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, I cannot restore their appearances for now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That being said, once the powers I&rsquo;ve bestown them awakens, they will be able to leave the Galewind Hunting Clan. At that time, they will naturally be able to restore their original appearances and return to being who they were,&rdquo; said that existence.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng became endlessly excited.<br>Chu Feng had realized everything and understood the entire story.<br>Chu Feng also felt that this existence wouldn&rsquo;t possibly lie to him.<br>After all, there was no reason for an existence as powerful as this being to lie to a nobody like him.<br>Furthermore, it was as this existence said. While Yan Ruyu, Ya Fei and Murong Wan could be said to be geniuses in the Eastern Sea Region, their talents were only mediocre when placed in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>As for the Ordinary Realms, they would only be able to become average cultivators.<br>As for the Upper Realms, they could only become lower tier cultivators.<br>Their talents had deemed their futures to be limited.<br>But, because of this existence&rsquo;s sudden whim, their fates had undergone a transformation.<br>Oh how enormously fortunate were they?<br>This was simply something that countless martial cultivators wouldn&rsquo;t even dare dream about.<br>Yet, it occurred to Yan Ruyu, Murong Wan and Ya Fei.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve learned all that you wanted to learn.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s nothing else, you can return now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, do not reveal the fact that this Exalted is here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you do, while this Exalted might be willing to keep you alive, I will not keep others alive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If this Exalted becomes displeased, I will not hesitate to take those three girls&rsquo; lives either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Remember this, to this Exalted, all living things are akin to ants,&rdquo; added that terrifying existence.<br>It was a reminder and not a threat.<br>After all, there was simply no need for it to threaten Chu feng. Those were all things that it was capable of accomplishing.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please rest assured. This junior will definitely keep the matter regarding you confidential.&rdquo;<br>While Chu Feng does not know why this existence was dwelling in this place, Chu Feng felt that there must be a reason. As for that reason, it was its secret that it does not wish for others to know about.<br>At least, it does not wish for the people of the Upper Realm to know about.<br>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s nothing else, go ahead and return, said that existence in a somewhat impatient manner.<br>Seeing this, Chu Feng did not dare to hesitate. He immediately bowed respectfully and soared into the sky. He was planning to leave.<br>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;<br>But, right when Chu Feng was about to step into the teleportation formation, that existence&rsquo;s voice sounded again.<br>The question that existence asked after caught Chu Feng at a complete surprise. Faintly, Chu Feng had a bad feeling.<br></p></div>
