        <h1>Chapter 5404</h1>
        <div><span>: Someone I Mustn&rsquo;t Offend</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;I&hellip; deserve to die thousand times over!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Shuang Yu channeled her spirit power into her hand to strike her own face. This strike would end her life if it landed.</span><br><span>However, Shuang Xue caught her hand in time to stop her. She glared at her younger sister as if she was insane. &ldquo;Are you out of your mind?!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Nianqing is my benefactor, and our young miss has once saved my life. Yet&hellip; I actually did something that atrocious to our young miss&rsquo; child. I deserve to die! I should die a thousand times over to repent for my crimes! Big sister, let me die! My conscience wouldn&rsquo;t allow me to continue living on the face of the world!&rdquo; Shuang Yu cried.</span><br><span>It wasn&rsquo;t an act. She truly regretted her actions and wanted to die to pay for her crimes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You do deserve to die, but your death won&rsquo;t solve anything. You should know what kind of situation our little young master is in. Even if we keep this matter a secret from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, with Chu Feng&rsquo;s talents and his refusal to lie low, he is bound to draw aggression from the other powers. Your decision to collude with Jie Zhou to harm him is a good example of that,&rdquo; Shuang Xue said.</span><br><span>Shuang Yu was unable to refute those words.</span><br><span>She had attempted to harm Chu Feng even when the latter had saved the prodigies of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. He was simply too talented that others would view him as a threat and attempt to eliminate him.</span><br><span>This was what the world of cultivation was like. More often than not, a person was more likely to repay kindness with ingratitude rather than kindness. The world of cultivation brought out the worst in humans.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Instead of dying a meaningless death, you should die trying to protect our little young master. That&rsquo;s the only way you can redeem yourself,&rdquo; Shuang Xue said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right. Please, allow me to meet Lord Nianqing. I&rsquo;ll make up for my previous folly. Even at the cost of my life, I&rsquo;ll ensure our little young master&rsquo;s safety!&rdquo; Shuang Yu pleaded with her knees on the floor.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Nianqing knows that you&rsquo;re loyal to her. She wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten so angry at you if not for our little young master. You know that she feels indebted to him. It&rsquo;ll be best for you to stay here and accept your punishment for the time being. Lord Nianqing will give you a chance to redeem yourself once she calms down,&rdquo; Shuang Xue said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll accept my punishment,&rdquo; Shuang Yu replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be activating the formation now.&rdquo; Shuang Xue stepped out of the jail cell before activating the formation.</span><br><span>Green auras appeared inside the massive prison cells, morphing into evil spirits that charged at Shuang Yu and Jie Zhou while brandishing their claws and gnashing their fangs. This was the formation inside Hell&rsquo;s Cage.</span><br><span>Shuang Yu knew what was coming, so she crossed her legs and sat down. She gritted her teeth, determined to withstand whatever those evil spirits were going to do to her. Yet, her face still warped in pain when those claws and fangs sank into her flesh.</span><br><span>Gah!</span><br><span>An even more miserable scream echoed in the prison cell. It was from Jie Zhou.</span><br><span>He was previously knocked out by Lord Nianqing&rsquo;s attack, but the excruciating assault of the evil spirits jolted him awake. After all, this was a formation designed to inflict the greatest amount of pain on the prisoners.</span><br><span>It was no wonder why even Shuang Yu shuddered in fear when she learned that she would be imprisoned here.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What are these? Get lost! Get lost!!!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Zhou was initially bewildered by the situation and even tried to fend off the evil spirits with his spirit power, only to realize that it was futile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother. You&rsquo;re in Hell&rsquo;s Cage,&rdquo; Shuang Yu said.</span><br><span>It was only then that Jie Zhou noticed Shuang Yu&rsquo;s presence, but the relentless assault of the evil spirits left him no chance to speak whatsoever. He was swiftly engulfed in so much pain that he didn&rsquo;t even have the strength to speak at all. He could only helplessly howl in agony.</span><br><span>To his relief, the evil spirits dissipated moments later.</span><br><span>Only then did Jie Zhou finally find the strength to get back to his feet and slowly stagger his way to Shuang Yu&rsquo;s side. He knew that this was nothing more than a short break, and the evil spirits would swiftly resume their assault. He had to leave this place, or else it wouldn&rsquo;t be long before he lost his mind.</span><br><span>&ldquo;L-Lord Shuang Yu, why are we here?&rdquo; Jie Zhou looked at Shuang Yu with an aggrieved look.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Shuang Yu sneered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because you offended Chu Feng.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng? I don&rsquo;t get it. Why would grandma get so angry at me over a mere Chu Feng? He&rsquo;s nothing but an outsider!&rdquo; Jie Zhou exclaimed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Outsider?&rdquo; Those words infuriated Shuang Yu. Even though she had also been severely weakened by the assault of the evil spirits, she raised her finger at Jie Zhou and roared, &ldquo;Do you know who Chu Feng is?! He is Lord Nianqing&rsquo;s real grandson! If anyone is an outsider, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;What are you saying? How could Chu Feng be my grandma&rsquo;s grandson?&rdquo; Jie Zhou was initially perplexed to hear those words, but a possibility quickly surfaced in his mind. &ldquo;Are you saying that&hellip; Chu Feng is Lord Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s child?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you finally know who you have offended?&rdquo; Shuang Yu coldly glared at Jie Zhou.</span><br><span>Jie Zhou&rsquo;s face turned ghastly pale. He was aware that Lord Nianqing only doted on him because she saw him as a substitute for her dead grandson, but he was never bothered by it since a dead person couldn&rsquo;t threaten his position.</span><br><span>But not only was Lord Nianqing&rsquo;s grandson still alive, but he even attempted to frame the other party. Lord Nianqing might still be willing to spare him on account of the time they had spent together, but it was questionable whether Lord Jie Ranqing would be as merciful.</span><br><span>Just the thought of becoming Lord Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s enemy sent shivers down his spine.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Shuang Yu, you have to save me! I&rsquo;m begging you! I didn&rsquo;t do it on purpose. How am I supposed to know that Chu Feng is Lord Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s child? Had I known that he was Lord Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s child, I would have never had the guts to do something as preposterous as that!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Zhou clutched onto Lord Shuang Yu&rsquo;s thighs and begged her. He was truly desperate.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo; Lord Shuang Yu coldly flung Jie Zhou aside.</span><br><span>She was earnestly fond of Jie Zhou, or else she wouldn&rsquo;t have bent her principles for his sake. However, those feelings dissipated when she realized what she had done. All that was left in her now was revulsion, both for Jie Zhou and herself.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I still have a chance, but there&rsquo;s no way out for you anymore&hellip; especially not after I have told you Chu Feng&rsquo;s identity,&rdquo; Shuang Yu said.</span><br><span>Jie Zhou collapsed to the ground with a look of despair, knowing that Shuang Yu was speaking the truth. His face crumbled with regret and indignance. He would have never dared to do those things had he known Chu Feng&rsquo;s true identity, but this was simply how life was.</span><br><span>Those who committed evil had to bear the consequences of their actions.</span><br></p></div>
