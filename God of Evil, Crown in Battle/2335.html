        <div> - Sharing Both Trials And Tribulations<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, is it me that didn&rsquo;t mention it clearly, or you who didn&rsquo;t hear what I said clearly?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Or could it be that you feel that my bargaining chip is insufficient?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, as long as you are willing to join our Infant Soul Sect, I am able to help you eliminate that Ying Heavenly Clan who has ordered your arrest,&rdquo; The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s True Immortal continued to attempt to entice Chu Feng.<br>Upon hearing what he said, the crowd was once again startled. After Chu Feng had clearly refused him, this True Immortal actually refused to give up. Instead, he increased the bargaining chip, and continued to attempt to entice Chu Feng. The sincerity he was showing moved even the crowd.<br>After all, he was a True Immortal-level expert, someone who stood at the apex of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. He was an existence akin to legend. It would not be too excessive to even consider him a god.<br>&ldquo;If you want to kill me, then go on ahead and do it. However, I have a request. This matter was caused by me. I hope that you will be willing to kill only me, and spare them,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he looked to Wang Qiang and the others.<br>Chu Feng had made his resolution. Even when facing death, he would not change his decision.<br>The reason for that was because he had promised his father that he would eliminate the Infant Soul Sect. If he were to yield to the Infant Soul Sect today, it would be too humiliating.<br>Chu Feng felt that if he were to do something like that, he would let down his father, his grandfather and his mother. Thus, even if he were to die, Chu Feng would still not surrender.<br>&ldquo;This thing?&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng felt a strange transformation in his Cosmos Sack.<br>It was the Evil God Sword. That Incomplete Imperial Armament, the Evil God Sword was actually devouring the other weapons in his Cosmos Sack. Not only had it managed to devour and refine all of the Imperial Armaments in Chu Feng&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack, it did not spare even the Incomplete Ancestral Armaments.<br>Its speed was so quick that one would simply feel speechless.<br>It was as if the Evil God Sword was not a weapon, but rather a ferocious beast that devoured weapons. Before it, even Incomplete Ancestral Armaments became extremely weak.<br>When Chu Feng managed to react, that Evil God Sword had completely devoured and refined all of the weapons in Chu Feng&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack.<br>Following that, it began to tremble violently. It was as if it was planning to rush out from the Cosmos Sack. It was as if it was impatient to demonstrate its might.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected that you would concern yourself with their lives at a time like this. Very well, even if you refuse to join our Infant Soul Sect, I will respect the fact that you are a man of character and agree to this request of yours.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, since you have refused me, it means that I will have to take your life,&rdquo; As that Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s True Immortal spoke, his eyes started to flicker with coldness.<br>At that moment, black clouds began to emerge in large numbers. As they scuttled in the sky, they combined with one another and formed a frightening giant face.<br>Following that, that True Immortal&rsquo;s unrivalled oppressive might was completely unleashed. It was as if, with a mere thought from him, his oppressive might would massacre all living things.<br>&ldquo;True Immortal, that is the strength of a True Immortal-level expert!!!&rdquo;<br>Upon sensing the aura currently being emitted by the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s True Immortal-level expert, many people started to tremble involuntarily. Those with weak levels of cultivation were so frightened by his aura that they fell onto their butts, becoming unable to move.<br>&ldquo;D-done for. We&rsquo;re d-done for. W-w-wife, w-what are we to do?&rdquo; Wang Qiang started to panic. He was truly panicking. The reason for that was because he was able to sense how enormously powerful that True Immortal was.<br>&ldquo;You ask me that, but who am I to ask? I too want to know what to do,&rdquo; Zhao Hong said in a displeased manner. It could be seen that Zhao Hong was also worried for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;F-fuck! Even if t-there&rsquo;s n-nothing that can be done, we m-must still do s-something. We c-cannot ignore m-my brother.&rdquo;<br>As Wang Qiang spoke, he soared toward the vast oppressive might. Then, he arrived in the sky and stood before Chu Feng.<br>Upon seeing Wang Qiang, Chu Feng hurriedly said, &ldquo;Wang Qiang, what are you doing? Quickly, get away from here!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hehe. B-brother, y-you want me to l-leave? You&rsquo;re l-looking down on me too much. W-what does it mean t-to be brothers? It means t-that while we m-might not be born on the s-same day of t-the same year, we can d-die on the same day of the same year.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To e-enjoy fortune together and u-undergo tribulations together, that i-is what it means to be brothers,&rdquo; Wang Qiang said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing what Wang Qiang said, Chu Feng felt warmth in his heart. When Chu Feng had obtained success and recognition, there were a lot of people that wanted to curry relationships with him, but when Chu Feng encountered calamities, there were not many people who were willing to take on the calamities together with him or even die alongside him.<br>Wang Qiang&rsquo;s actions had truly moved Chu Feng.<br>However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng still do not wish to have Wang Qiang die with him. Thus, he wanted to persuade Wang Qiang against it.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before Chu Feng could finish what he wanted to say, another figure flew over and arrived before him.<br>Turning toward that figure, Chu Feng was extremely surprised. The reason for that was because it was Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;What my husband said is correct. We shall undergo trials and tribulations together. Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t think about being the hero alone,&rdquo; Zhao Hong said with a light smile.<br>Like Wang Qiang, Zhao Hong had a very easy-going appearance. It was as if she had seen through life and death. Facing death, she actually did not have the slightest trace of fear on her face.<br>If Wang Qiang&rsquo;s willingness to accompany Chu Feng in death caused Chu Feng to feel warmth in his heart, then Zhao Hong&rsquo;s decision to accompany him in death came as a great surprise to Chu Feng.<br>After all, Zhao Hong was a demonic woman. The only reason why she became acquainted with Chu Feng and Wang Qiang was because she had originally wanted to eat Wang Qiang.<br>However, this Zhao Hong was actually able to step forward bravely during the time of Chu Feng&rsquo;s calamity. This truly overturned the opinion Chu Feng had of this demonic woman.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, we&rsquo;ll also accompany you.&rdquo;<br>Following that, Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu also flew toward Chu Feng and stood beside him.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, this old man admires your character. Today, even if a calamity is to befall you, I cannot allow you to die alone.&rdquo;<br>Following that, even some of the experts from the older generation began to fly into the sky and stand before Chu Feng.<br>Soon, there were several tens of figures standing beside Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You all&hellip; everyone&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart was surging with warmth. That moving sensation filled his entire body.<br>Although there were only several tens of people willing to die with him...<br>Although this number was simply unworthy of being mentioned when compared to the tens of thousands of people present.<br>Many of the people here were individuals that he had only just met. In fact, many among them were people that he had never spoken with before. Yet, they were willing to die with him at this sort of time. As such, how could Chu Feng not feel moved?<br>&ldquo;This is truly what they mean by a friend in need is a friend indeed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are a very charismatic person. You are truly a genius.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is truly a pity to kill you,&rdquo; Seeing this scene, that Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s True Immortal-level expert was also somewhat moved. However, even though he had a pitiful expression, the killing intent in his eyes did not decrease in the slightest. With one word at a time, he said, &ldquo;However, I will not spare you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You wish to kill me? I&rsquo;m afraid that you might not necessarily be able to!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng streaked his palm across his Cosmos Sack. Then, the Evil God Sword was held in his hand.<br>At that moment, the Evil God Sword did not appear to be peculiar in the slightest. In fact, it appeared to be inferior to even ordinary Incomplete Imperial Armaments. It resembled a lousy piece of wood.<br>However, as he held it in his hand, Chu Feng was able to sense that the Evil God Sword contained enormous power; it was unimaginably powerful. Chu Feng felt that he might really be able to fight against that True Immortal using the Evil God Sword.<br>Holding the Evil God Sword, Chu Feng began to walk in the air one step at a time. He walked past Wang Qiang, Zhao Hong and all the others.<br>He was planning to use the Evil God Sword to fight against that True Immortal.<br>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Incomplete Imperial Armament? Why is Chu feng holding an Incomplete Imperial Armament?&rdquo;<br>After hearing what Chu Feng said, the crowd originally thought that he was going to unleash something grand. However, after they saw the Evil God Sword, they were all tongue-tied with their eyes wide open.<br>It was not because they were terrified by the Evil God Sword. Rather, they were startled.<br>The reason for that was because they were truly unable to understand why Chu Feng would take out a weapon like the Evil God Sword at such a crucial time.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. Chu Feng, are you trying to make me laugh? You actually want to use an Incomplete Imperial Armament to contend against the True Immortal? Have you been kicked in the head or what?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a loud, ridiculing laughter was heard. It was Kou Kang. Even though Kou Kang was enveloped by that True Immortal&rsquo;s oppressive might, he was still unable to contain himself from ridiculing and laughing at Chu feng when he saw Chu Feng&rsquo;s Incomplete Imperial Armament.<br>In fact, it was not only Kou Kang that was laughing at Chu Feng. Countless others were laughing at Chu Feng in their hearts.<br>After all, even if Chu Feng were to take out an Ancestral Armament at a time like this, it would still be useless.<br>Yet, he took out an Imperial Armament, and an Incomplete Imperial Armament on top of that.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, that True Immortal expert suddenly turned around and waved his sleeve.<br>He brought Old Demon Rakshasa and Hun Lian to his side. Then, his body suddenly moved, and he began to flee.<br><br></p></div>
