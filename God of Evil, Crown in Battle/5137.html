        <div>: Not Someone You Can Mess With<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lord Bai chuckled at those words. It turned out that he really was the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal.<br>&ldquo;Are you surprised that I&rsquo;m not dead yet? Well, I guess that&rsquo;s only normal. I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought that the famous Myriad Monstrous Beast Ancestor would be alive too. I could almost burst into tears, being able to meet an old friend like you once again. It&rsquo;s no wonder they say that old pals cry tears of joy when meeting each other in a foreign land.&rdquo;<br>The Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal even raised his hand as if to wipe off his tears, just that there were none. There wasn&rsquo;t even the slightest hint of sorrow on his face. Instead, he had a bright smile on his lips.<br>&ldquo;Who is old friends with you? Don&rsquo;t flatter yourself!&rdquo;<br>The terrifying giant face released its oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;Eyy, don&rsquo;t get so agitated. This junior will apologize to you, alright? Lord Myriad Monstrous Beast Ancestor, please accept this humble junior&rsquo;s apology.&rdquo;<br>The Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal quickly clasped his fist and bowed. His tone also became much more courteous and respectful.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play such tricks with me. If it weren&rsquo;t for how hard it was for you to survive to this day, I would have had you killed for daring to intrude on my territory!&rdquo; the terrifying<br>face said.<br>&ldquo;I know that Lord Myriad Monstrous Beast Ancestor wouldn&rsquo;t bully a humble junior like me. I must say, I wouldn&rsquo;t have expected any less from Lord Myriad Monstrous Beast Ancestor. Not only did you survive, but you even preserved so many races from the Ancient Era. It looks like they didn&rsquo;t revere you as their ancestor for nothing.&rdquo;<br>Despite the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal&rsquo;s respectful attitude, it was apparent that he wasn&rsquo;t particularly afraid of the terrifying<br>face. He casually looked around the realm, and his eyes widened in surprise even though there was nothing that could be seen in a normal human&rsquo;s vision range.<br>&ldquo;You dare to peek around my territory after barging in here? Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal, do you really think that I wouldn&rsquo;t kill you?&rdquo;<br>The terrifying<br>face&rsquo;s tone was becoming impatient, and the oppressive might coming from the sky grew even heavier.<br>&ldquo;Wait wait wait! We&rsquo;re still acquaintances even if you don&rsquo;t think of me as a friend. There&rsquo;s no need to get so violent! Actually, I came here because there&rsquo;s something I would like to ask you,&rdquo; the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;You wish to ask about the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s forbidden land?&rdquo; the terrifying<br>face asked.<br>&ldquo;It looks like Lord Myriad Monstrous Beast Ancestor has already heard of the matter. Could you tell me what kind of secrets are hidden in the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s forbidden land? To think that it would actually sap the natural energies of the Ancestral Martial Realm dry!&rdquo; the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal asked.<br>&ldquo;How would I know about the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s secrets? If you wish to know, you should ask Chu Feng,&rdquo; the massive terrifying face replied.<br>&ldquo;Lord Myriad Monstrous Beast Ancestor, aren&rsquo;t you being mean here? Why don&rsquo;t you just fulfill my curiosity this once and tell me?&rdquo;<br>The Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal clasped his fist toward the sky as he spoke.<br>It looked awfully flippant when someone of the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal&rsquo;s age made such a gesture, but the terrifying<br>face did retract its oppressive might in response.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s special power imbued in the Heavenly Road. It has been there ever since I awoke from my hibernation. I don&rsquo;t know what it is either,&rdquo; the terrifying<br>face replied.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know either?&rdquo;<br>Those words meant that the terrifying<br>face had tried to uncover the secrets behind the forbidden land too. The Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal knew that while the Myriad Monstrous Beast Ancestor was incredibly arrogant, it wasn&rsquo;t fond of lying. It would rather remain silent than utter falsehood.<br>&ldquo;Milord, do you know who&rsquo;s the one who set up the protective formation? It doesn&rsquo;t look like it has been there for a long time,&rdquo; the Eight Trigram Dao Immortal asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure who is the one behind the protective formation, but my guess is that it&rsquo;s Chu Feng&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; the terrifying<br>face asked.<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanyuan? He isn&rsquo;t even a thousand years of age yet, but he already wields such power?&rdquo;<br>The Eight Trigram Dao Immortal was surprised.<br>He had first heard Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s name back when he was still in the Darknight Sacred River. It was only after he came out of the Darknight Sacred River that he learned that Chu Feng&rsquo;s father was a prodigy, but he didn&rsquo;t think that the latter would actually be this powerful.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing the incredulous look on the Eight Trigrams Doa Immortal&rsquo;s face, the terrifying<br>face revealed a deep smile.<br>&ldquo;Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal, don&rsquo;t underestimate the cultivators of the current generation. At the very least, Chu Feng&rsquo;s father is not someone whom you can trifle with. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s your motive for following Chu Feng, but I&rsquo;ll offer you some words of advice in view that we&rsquo;re both from the Ancient Era:<br>Don&rsquo;t mess with Chu Feng<br>,&rdquo; the terrifying<br>face said.<br>&ldquo;I never thought that Chu Xuanyuan would be such a formidable individual,&rdquo; the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal exclaimed.<br>Putting aside the terrifying protective formation that he had personally experienced not too long ago, the Myriad Monstrous Beast Ancestor&rsquo;s evaluation of Chu Xuanyuan was also astounding too. He knew that the Myriad Monstrous Beast Ancestor was incredibly arrogant.<br>There were only so few people in the world who were deserving of his compliments.<br>Nevertheless, he wasn&rsquo;t too worried about it since he had never thought of making an enemy out of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Milord, there&rsquo;s one more thing I&rsquo;d like to know. Chu Feng said that his family and friends have been kidnapped by a mysterious man. Some of them were even taken right away from your territory. You can&rsquo;t possibly be oblivious to it, right?&rdquo; the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal asked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to meddle in other people&rsquo;s business, but there&rsquo;s nothing on this Misty Peak that escapes my notice,&rdquo; the terrifying<br>face said.<br>&ldquo;Milord, can you tell me who the culprit is?&rdquo; the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal asked.<br>&ldquo;Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal, don&rsquo;t push your luck. I have no obligation to fulfill your curiosity. I have already done you a favor by answering all of your questions thus far, but I don&rsquo;t have time to engage in idle chatter with you. You should leave now,&rdquo; the terrifying<br>face said.<br>&ldquo;Milord, don&rsquo;t be like this. How about this? I&rsquo;ll exchange news with you,&rdquo; the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested,&rdquo; the terrifying<br>face replied.<br>&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;ll definitely be interested in this. It has something to do with you,&rdquo; the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal replied.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br>That successfully piqued the terrifying<br>face&rsquo;s interest.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to answer my question first, milord,&rdquo; the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal said with a chuckle.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trust you this once, Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal. However, if what you said afterward has nothing to do with me, you need not dream of leaving this place safe and sound,&rdquo; the terrifying<br>face threatened.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, milord. I&rsquo;d never dare to lie to you,&rdquo; the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal replied.<br>&ldquo;The culprit is a cultivator from the present era,&rdquo; the terrifying<br>face said.<br>&ldquo;Milord, do you have more detailed information about that person? Maybe his identity? Or his whereabouts?&rdquo; the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal probed on.<br>&ldquo;Who do you take me to be? Your informant? Why would I investigate things that are none of my business?&rdquo; the terrifying<br>face replied impatiently.<br>&ldquo;Milord, at least give me some clues. What you&rsquo;ve told me is too broad! Ey, I&rsquo;ll be honest with you. I actually admire young friend Chu Feng a lot, and I followed him because I was curious to know what he was going to do. I have no intention of harming him.<br>&ldquo;I have matters to attend to, so I&rsquo;ll have to part ways with him very soon. I can tell that he&rsquo;s very worried about his family and friends, so I wanted to see if I could help him in any way,&rdquo; the Eight Trigrams Dao Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, you should drop the idea. The culprit is not someone whom you can mess with either,&rdquo; the terrifying<br>face said.<br></p></div>
