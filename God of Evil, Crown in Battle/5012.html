        <div>: Chu Guyu<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Is that&hellip; the Dragon Breath Token?&rdquo;<br>The crowd gathered around Chu Feng to take a better look at the token in his hands. The two characters inscribed on the token, &lsquo;Dragon Breath&rsquo;, were sufficient to verify its origin.<br>Even the waiters of the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber had come over to verify the situation too. They carefully inspected the True Dragon Chessboard, trying to discern whether Chu Feng had really deciphered it or not.<br>&ldquo;Customer, it looks like you&hellip; really managed to decipher the True Dragon Chessboard.&rdquo;<br>Soon, they turned to look at Chu Feng with eyes filled with respect.<br>Clearly, they had already come to an answer.<br>&ldquo;In other words, I&rsquo;m not playing any tricks here, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. You have deciphered the True Dragon Chessboard for real. Young master, you&rsquo;re truly formidable. You&rsquo;re the only person in so many years to have deciphered the True Dragon Chessboard!&rdquo; one of the waiters exclaimed.<br>His voice was filled with admiration.<br>&ldquo;How is it? Are you going to admit your loss?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Li Han.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>There was an awful look on Li Han&rsquo;s face, almost as if someone had stuffed feces into his mouth. If there was a hole in the ground right now, he would leap in without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.<br>It was simply too embarrassing.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with that expression on Li Han&rsquo;s face? Is he going to renege on his promise?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Admit your loss and fulfill the end of your bet!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This young master over here has already proven his capabilities.&rdquo;<br>The spectators started to speak up on Chu Feng&rsquo;s behalf. Despite looking down on Chu Feng just a moment ago, they had changed their tunes and were now pointing their fingers at Li Han.<br>&ldquo;Hmph! I, Li Han, am a man of my words. Take it!&rdquo;<br>Indignance could be heard through Li Han&rsquo;s words, but he couldn&rsquo;t break his promise in a public like this. That would have sullied the Heavenwind Sword Sect&rsquo;s reputation. Thus, he handed the twenty Dragon Spring Coins to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Please bring me two bowls of Dragon Spring,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he passed the twenty Dragon Spring Coins to one of the waiters.<br>&ldquo;Bring me a bowl too,&rdquo; the valiant woman from the Heavenwind Sword Sect said.<br>&ldquo;Alright! Coming right up!&rdquo;<br>This time, the waiter brought the two bowls of Dragon Spring up much faster than before. It could be because Chu Feng had proven himself, raising their opinions of him.<br>&ldquo;You can drink your fill now,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he passed the two bowls of Dragon Spring to the father and son.<br>&ldquo;Young hero, t-this won&rsquo;t do. It&rsquo;ll do for us to just have a sip of it. I can&rsquo;t accept such a precious gift from you,&rdquo; the middle-aged man said in embarrassment.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, I don&rsquo;t need so much.&rdquo;<br>The little boy also vehemently shook his head even though he gulped down a mouthful of saliva.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to stand on ceremony. I&rsquo;m doing this of my own volition. I can tell you&rsquo;re a good father who cares deeply for your son. I just feel like helping you here,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied earnestly.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that he was an evil person, but neither did he think that he was a hero whose mission was to save the world. He cultivated for the sake of protecting his family and friends, not to bring salvation to the world.<br>He did do good deeds from time to time, but that was not out of obligation but simply because he felt like doing so.<br>That father and son had managed to move Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart, and that was why he was willing to go this far for them.<br>&ldquo;Young hero, kind people like you will be rewarded!&rdquo;<br>The middle-aged man accepted the two bowls of Dragon Spring and began enjoying it with his son.<br>Just then, someone passed a bowl of Dragon Spring to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mistreat yourself in the midst of helping others. It&rsquo;s not easy to stumble upon the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber. Have your own fill too.&rdquo;<br>It was the valiant woman from the Heavenwind Sword Sect. It turned out that the bowl of Dragon Spring she had ordered earlier was intended for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I am Chu Guyu from the Heavenwind Sword Sect. I apologize for my fellow sect member&rsquo;s offense, and I hope that you&rsquo;ll be magnanimous enough to forgive us with this bowl of Dragon Spring.&rdquo;<br>She offered the bowl of Dragon Spring with both hands, even bowing slightly as she spoke. Her attitude was much better than before.<br>&ldquo;Chu Guyu? She&rsquo;s the granddaughter of the Heavenwind Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I heard that Chu Guyu possesses talent greater than that of Li Han, and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before she surpasses him as the number one disciple.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is my first time seeing her. I heard that she rarely leaves the Heavenwind Sword Sect, so hardly anyone has seen her face before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that she would be such a dignified woman. Truly extraordinary.&rdquo;<br>Discussions could be heard echoing in the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber after the woman introduced herself. This explained why the younger disciples, including Li Han, were fawning on her.<br>It turned out that she was a person who possessed both strength and background. It would be weird if she wasn&rsquo;t fawned on by those around her.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Chu Guyu?&rdquo;<br>However, what Chu Feng was more interested in was the woman&rsquo;s name.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Guyu asked in bewilderment.<br>&ldquo;Your name sounds endearing,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>His big brother in the Chu clan also went by the name of Chu Guyu. Even though he knew that they were just homonyms, he still felt a lot of goodwill toward her over the name. That was how much he treasured that older brother of his.<br>Chu Feng had been oppressed in his younger years in the Chu clan. If not for his godfather and Chu Guyu, things would have been much harder for him.<br>&ldquo;Endearing? You sure know how to utter nonsense. I never knew that a person could find a name endearing. If I have to say, aren&rsquo;t you just finding a pretext to get close to my junior?&rdquo; Li Han sneered.<br>Chu Feng chuckled in response, knowing that Li Han was just envious.<br>&ldquo;Miss Chu, I am Chu Feng. Fate has brought us together today. Since this bowl of Dragon Spring contains your sincerity, I&rsquo;ll humbly accept your token of goodwill.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng took the bowl of Dragon Spring and gulped it down in a single mouthful. It felt even more refreshing than the first time he drank it.<br>If it was possible, he would have willingly traded his Exalted Armaments for another bowl of Dragon Spring. The taste was definitely worth the price.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m impressed by how you were able to decipher the True Dragon Chessboard with ease. You must be the disciple of a renowned expert. May I know which sect are you from?&rdquo; Chu Guyu asked.<br>If she was only interested in the True Dragon Chessboard previously, she was now interested in Chu Feng as a person.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not from here,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>His words indicated his reluctance to reveal his personal details.<br>&ldquo;Is young master Chu Feng a foreigner? If so, our Heavenwind Sword Sect ought to play the role of a host and invite you over,&rdquo; Chu Guyu said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not convenient at the moment. Let&rsquo;s do that another day.&rdquo;<br>He knew that even if he wanted to go, the Netherworld Envoy wouldn&rsquo;t agree to it.<br>&ldquo;Feel free to visit us whenever you wish, young master Chu Feng. Our Heavenwind Sword Sect will welcome you.&rdquo;<br>The woman passed a token to Chu Feng. It was an honorary guest invitation token.<br>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng accepted the token from her.<br>It was unlikely that he would visit the Heavenwind Sword Sect, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be good for him to refuse the other party&rsquo;s goodwill.<br></p></div>
