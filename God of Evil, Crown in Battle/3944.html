        <div> - Extraordinary Expert<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;If you want to know what&rsquo;s going on, we merely need to go and find your Lady Headmaster.&rdquo;<br>As Pang Bo&rsquo;s father spoke, he began to fly towards the Whiteclothes Nunnery.<br>Linghu An&rsquo;an didn&rsquo;t stop him. After all, this was something that concerned the safety of her young miss. She also wanted to know exactly what was going on.<br>After arriving at the Whiteclothes Nunnery, they did not beat around the bush, and directly informed the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster about the current situation in Mount Ivory Valley.<br>They also informed her about Linghu Yueyue entering the lake with the bottle gourd.<br>Originally, Pang Bo, his father and Linghu An&rsquo;an thought that the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster would know the secrets of Mount Ivory Valley.<br>However, to their surprise, even the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster was extremely astonished, and even revealed a look of fear after learning what had happened.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such an enormous change?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That girl, why would she be so foolish?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault. I shouldn&rsquo;t have had the two of you go retrieve that item at such a time.&rdquo;<br>Regret filled the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster&rsquo;s face as she sighed.<br>&ldquo;Lady Headmaster, it is too late to say that now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead, please tell us about the origin of that bottle gourd, and what exactly you told my young miss,&rdquo; urged Linghu An&rsquo;an. She was extremely concerned about her young miss&rsquo;s safety.<br>The Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster did not attempt to conceal anything. She told Linghu An&rsquo;an, Pang Bo and Pang Bo&rsquo;s father everything.<br>Although the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster was in charge of the Whiteclothes Nunnery, she was actually a nobody before the Cloudspirit Clan. The Whiteclothes Nunnery and the Cloudspirit Clan were simply two powers on completely different levels.<br>The reason why she was able to have a relationship with the Cloudspirit Clan was because of something that had happened roughly thirteen years ago.<br>Thirteen years ago, an old man had appeared outside the Whiteclothes Nunnery.<br>Sitting at the foot of the mountain, that old man appeared very exhausted. He seemed like he had trained excessively, or experienced a fierce battle. Regardless, his condition was rather weak.<br>Out of kindness, the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster delivered a cup of water to that old man.<br>The water was actually specially refined medicinal water. It tasted just like ordinary drinking water, but was capable of alleviating one&rsquo;s tiredness.<br>What the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster didn&rsquo;t know at the time was that the old man was an expert martial cultivator of profound and mysterious cultivation.<br>He was extremely powerful. Naturally, he also had a lot of treasures.<br>The water prepared by the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster was simply of barely any assistance to him at all.<br>However, because of that act of kindness, that profoundly powerful expert of an old man gave the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster two treasures.<br>One was a green porcelain cup.<br>As for the other, it was the bottle gourd Linghu Yueyue had used.<br>Afterwards, the old man brought the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster with him and proceeded for Mount Ivory Valley.<br>He placed the green porcelain bowl inside the palace where the Spirit Spring Water emerged from.<br>After the green porcelain bowl was placed inside the palace, the speed at which the Spirit Spring Water flowed actually increased slightly.<br>This brought wild joy to the Cloudspirit Clan. After all, the Cloudspirit Clan had guarded the Spirit Spring Water for many years. Yet, there had never been any change to it.<br>However, a single porcelain bowl was actually able to accelerate the speed at which the Spirit Spring Water flowed. It was only natural for them to be overjoyed.<br>However, that old man explicitly told the Cloudspirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief that the green porcelain bowl belonged to the Whiteclothes Nunnery, and was only being placed in the palace for storage.<br>To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, the fearless Cloudspirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief actually agreed to the demand from the old man without any hesitation.<br>Furthermore, he even vowed that if the people from the Whiteclothes Nunnery decided to come retrieve the porcelain bowl, they could do so at any time and they, the Cloudspirit Clan, would definitely not stop them.<br>With that, the old man left Mount Ivory Valley with the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster. After that, he taught her a technique.<br>Furthermore, the old man also told her something.<br>He told her to retrieve the porcelain bowl in eight years. Then, through the technique he taught her, she was to activate the porcelain bowl. With that, she would be able to use the porcelain bowl to train.<br>Apart from that, the old man also informed the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster that if she were to refuse to listen to his words and not retrieve the porcelain bowl, then the Spirit Spring Water in Mount Ivory Valley would change, or cracks would appear in Mount Ivory Valley. Should either one of those things happen, it would mean that danger would descend upon the region.<br>Should that happen, the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster must immediately leave.<br>During times of danger, she could also utilize the power of the bottle gourd.<br>That bottle gourd would be able to keep her safe.<br>But, why would that porcelain bowl be able to be used to train in eight years&rsquo; time?<br>Also, why would danger appear in Mount Ivory Valley?<br>The old man did not explain either of those.<br>Afterwards, the old man left and never appeared again.<br>In the blink of an eye, over a dozen years had passed. That porcelain bowl was long past the date when it could be retrieved.<br>However, the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster was someone without ambition. Because of that, she had never retrieved the porcelain bowl to use it for training.<br>She thought that since the porcelain bowl was able to increase the flow of the Spirit Spring Water, it would be a good thing to keep it there to help the Cloudspirit Clan, and others who came seeking the Spirit Spring Water.<br>It was only after she learned about the change that had occurred to Mount Ivory Valley that she suddenly recalled the things the old man had told her.<br>That was why she had ordered Linghu Yueyue and Linghu An&rsquo;an to retrieve the porcelain bowl.<br>Even though she had no idea what exactly had caused the change to Mount Ivory Valley, she realized from the words spoken by the old man back then that things might not be simple.<br>Because of that, she had handed the bottle gourd to Linghu Yueyue.<br>She told Linghu Yueyue the method to activate the bottle gourd. She also told her to activate the bottle gourd should unforeseen dangers occur in Mount Ivory Valley, because that bottle gourd would be able to protect her and Linghu An&rsquo;an.<br>Merely, the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster did not expect the location of the Spirit Spring Water to be submerged by poisonous water, having turned into a lake with Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms inside.<br>As matters stood, she finally realized why the old man had given her such a warning.<br>Evidently, that old man already knew about the circumstances of that place, and that such an unforeseen event would occur there.<br>Merely, she had never realized that that place was actually that dangerous.<br>&ldquo;Senior, in that case, do you know the name of that mysterious expert?&rdquo; Pang Bo asked curiously.<br>He was not the only one with curiosity written all over his face; his father and Linghu An&rsquo;an were also filled with curiosity.<br>They were able to tell that the mysterious old man was an extraordinary individual. Likely, he knew much more than they&rsquo;d witnessed.<br>Now that Mount Ivory Valley was in a crisis, if they were able to find that mysterious old man, perhaps he would have a way to control the situation.<br>&ldquo;That mysterious expert did not mention his name to me,&rdquo; the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster shook her head.<br>&ldquo;Then what does he look like? If you are to draw a portrait of him, I can go and ask who he might be,&rdquo; Pang Bo continued.<br>The Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster shook her head helplessly.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that senior never managed to see the appearance of that mysterious expert?&rdquo; asked Pang Bo.<br>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve seen that mysterious expert&rsquo;s appearance. He did not conceal himself,&rdquo; said the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that mysterious expert refused to allow senior to reveal his appearance to others?&rdquo; asked Pang Bo.<br>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not it,&rdquo; the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster shook her head again.<br>&ldquo;Then&hellip;?&rdquo;<br>Pang Bo, his father and Linghu An&rsquo;an looked at each other in dismay. Confusion filled their eyes. They all wanted to know why the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster was unwilling to reveal the look of that mysterious old man.<br>Seeing the puzzled looks of the three people, the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster finally spoke, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I am refusing to reveal his looks. It&rsquo;s also not that I was exactly prevented from revealing his looks by that mysterious expert.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that ever since I parted with that mysterious expert, I am unable to recall his appearance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I remember every word of my conversation with him. I also firmly remembered that I managed to have a clear view of his face. However, after parting with him, I have been unable to recall his appearance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In fact, I am not the only one. Even the Cloudspirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and others from the Cloudspirit Clan are unable to recall his appearance,&rdquo; said the Whiteclothes Nunnery&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>Hearing those words, Pang Bo, his father and Linghu An&rsquo;an finally came to a realization.<br>The Whiteclothes Nunnery's headmaster and the people from the Cloudspirit Clan should&rsquo;ve had their memories of that old man&rsquo;s appearance, and only that, wiped clean.<br>Because of that, they firmly remembered the words spoken by and the things done by that mysterious expert. It was only his appearance that they failed to recall.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that that mysterious expert was truly an extraordinary expert,&rdquo; Pang Bo&rsquo;s father gasped with admiration.<br></p></div>
