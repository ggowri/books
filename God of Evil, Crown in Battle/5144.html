        <h1>Chapter 5143</h1>
        <div>: Cat Claws<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;City Lord Liang, we just wish to gather some information about Immortal Slaughterer. We haven&rsquo;t decided on anything yet. Please tell us if you have any information on them,&rdquo; Song Yuwei said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Yuwei, it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m unwilling to divulge their information to you, but you should know what kind of organization Immortal Slaughterer is. They are as careful as they are cruel. They have always been the ones investigating others; rarely would anyone dare to investigate them. I&rsquo;m afraid that I really don&rsquo;t have much information on them.<br>&ldquo;However, I did hear that Immortal Slaughterer used to have 29 members, but now they only have seven people remaining. These seven are extremely close to each other, and they have a formation embedded into each of their bodies. Should any of them meet with danger, the formation will activate, allowing them to share their senses and even communicate telepathically.<br>&ldquo;Immortal Slaughterer would issue a warning to the person who dared to hurt their member, and if that person refuses to listen, Immortal Slaughterer will launch an all-out assassination against that person. They might be an assassination organization, but they wouldn&rsquo;t allow anyone to take the life of their members.<br>&ldquo;To make things worse, the remaining seven members of Immortal Slaughterer are extremely powerful. Even at its peak, the Situ World Spiritist Clan came nowhere close to matching Immortal Slaughterer,&rdquo; City Lord Liang said.<br>&ldquo;City Lord Liang, do you really have no other news on Immortal Slaughterer?&rdquo; Song Yuwei asked again.<br>&ldquo;Lord Yuwei, I really don&rsquo;t have any other news on Immortal Slaughterer. I would have told you if I knew anything at all,&rdquo; City Lord Liang replied.<br>&ldquo;How much should I pay for the information I&rsquo;ve asked from you?&rdquo; Song Yuwei asked.<br>City Lord Liang provided information to others at a price, and the price was determined by the value of the information.<br>&ldquo;Lord Yuwei, Lord Luoyi is my savior, and you&rsquo;re the only kin Lord Luoyi has left in the world. It&rsquo;s my honor to be able to provide you with information. It would be an affront to my honor if you insist on paying me for my information,&rdquo; City Lord Liang said.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, I won&rsquo;t stand on ceremony,&rdquo; Song Yuwei said.<br>She then turned to Chu Feng, a gesture for him to ask any question he wanted.<br>&ldquo;City Lord Liang, you mentioned that the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief is in closed-door training. May I know where and when he went into closed-door training? Is it in the Situ World Spiritist Clan?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s currently in the Situ World Spiritist Clan. It should be in their forbidden land, which is reserved specifically for closed-door training, but I don&rsquo;t have the exact details on its location,&rdquo; City Lord Liang said.<br>&ldquo;What about Grand Elder Situ Tingye? Is he currently in the Situ World Spiritist Clan?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Situ Tingye isn&rsquo;t in the Situ World Spiritist Clan at the moment. In fact, he&rsquo;s currently in our True Dragon Upper Realm,&rdquo; City Lord Liang replied.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s also in the True Dragon Upper Realm? What is he doing here?&rdquo; Song Yuwei asked in surprise.<br>While the True Dragon Upper Realm was also part of the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s territory, it was hardly the strongest Upper Realm in the starfield. It was rare for those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan to visit this place.<br>&ldquo;Lord Yuwei, do you still remember the origins behind True Dragon Upper Realm?&rdquo; City Lord Liang asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course I do. Many years ago, a formidable world spiritist emerged from the True Dragon Upper Realm. His skills were so formidable that the Totem Dragon Clan invited him over as an honorary guest elder.<br>&ldquo;He passed away many years ago, but the Totem Dragon Clan, in view of the huge contributions he has made, decided to name the starfield he was from as the True Dragon Starfield. Even though the Situ World Spiritist Clan eventually took over the starfield and became its overlord, they weren&rsquo;t allowed to rename the place.<br>&ldquo;The True Dragon Upper Realm happens to be where he was born. There were rumors that the legendary world spiritist left his legacy here, but it was eventually shrugged off as a rumor as no one has been able to find it over the years.<br>&ldquo;In the present day, the True Dragon Upper Realm can only be considered average compared to the rest of the starfield. It&rsquo;s mostly known only for the legendary world spiritist who has risen from this land,&rdquo; Song Yuwei said.<br>&ldquo;Then you should know why the Situ World Spiritist Clan is here now, right?&rdquo; City Lord Liang asked with a hinting smile.<br>Song Yuwei and Chu Feng immediately caught his drift.<br>&ldquo;Are you saying that the legacy of the legendary world spiritist really exists, and someone actually found it?&rdquo; Song Yuwei asked.<br>&ldquo;Over the past year, the Situ World Spiritist Clan has dispatched quite a few experts to the True Dragon Upper Realm. None of them have divulged their reason for coming here, but my sources tell me that they are here for an ancient remnant, or more specifically, the legacy of the legendary world spiritist. Just a few days ago, Grand Elder Situ Tingye came over too.<br>&ldquo;I believe that this might be a sign that the ancient remnant is on the verge of opening,&rdquo; City Lord Liang said.<br>&ldquo;City Lord Liang, do you know where the ancient remnant is?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;<br>City Lord Liang took out a map and passed it to Chu Feng. Chu Feng unrolled the map and saw a location indicated on it.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, the ancient remnant is located there. However, I&rsquo;d still advise you not to head there. Not only does the Situ World Spiritist Clan has many experts guarding the ancient remnant, but there are also those from the other powers who are keeping a close eye on it. There&rsquo;s bound to be a bloodbath regardless of whether it&rsquo;s really the legendary world spiritist&rsquo;s ancient remnant or not,&rdquo; City Lord Liang said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for your reminder, City Lord Liang. We&rsquo;ll take note of it.&rdquo;<br>Despite not directly revealing his intention, Chu Feng&rsquo;s words made it clear that he intended to pay the ancient remnant a visit.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, Lord Yuwei, you may keep the map, but I have a request to ask of you. Please don&rsquo;t tell anyone that I was the one who divulged the news to you. If the Situ World Spiritist Clan learns about this matter, my entire clan will be massacred,&rdquo; City Lord Liang said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, City Lord Liang. We know how to watch our mouths,&rdquo; Lord Yuwei replied.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, City Lord Liang.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng clasped his fist and expressed his gratitude. The information he had received today was extremely useful for their future operations.<br>A rank four Half-God was completely within Chu Feng&rsquo;s means to deal with. If Situ Tingye was really in the True Dragon Upper Realm, there was no reason for Chu Feng not to confront him.<br>City Lord Liang had an important guest to attend to whereas Chu Feng was in a rush to look for the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s grand elder, so they decided to end the conversation there. City Lord Liang personally escorted them to the city gates.<br>It was only after seeing Chu Feng and Song Yuwei off that he finally returned to his residence. He headed to another hall that was used to host esteemed guests.<br>A man wearing a veiled bamboo hat that covered his facial features was sitting in there. He was extremely short, almost like a dwarf, but City Lord Liang dared not to show the slightest disrespect to him at all.<br>&ldquo;My apologies, Lord Tiger. I&rsquo;ve kept you waiting,&rdquo; City Lord Liang immediately apologized upon walking in.<br>&ldquo;What guest is even more important than me? I was the first one here, but you left before we could finish our conversation and even kept me waiting here. Is it a Situ World Spiritist Clansman?&rdquo; the short man asked.<br>&ldquo;Lord Tiger, they aren&rsquo;t from the Situ World Spiritist Clan but my benefactors. I know that it wasn&rsquo;t right of me to have kept you hanging. As an apology, I shan&rsquo;t haggle on the price here. I&rsquo;ll sell this piece of information at your offered price.&rdquo;<br>City Lord Liang took out a map and passed it to the short man. It was the same map that he had given Chu Feng earlier on.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like it.&rdquo;<br>The short man didn&rsquo;t receive the map right away. However, a hand holding a smoking pipe emerged from the veil. He put one end of the smoking pipe into his mouth and took a deep whiff of it.<br>But what was attention-catching wasn&rsquo;t the smoking pipe but the hand holding onto it. It wasn&rsquo;t a human&rsquo;s hand but a cat&rsquo;s claw.<br></p></div>
