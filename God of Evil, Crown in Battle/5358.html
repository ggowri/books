        <div><span>: Excessive Worry</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;Hah. Courage born out of ignorance.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The old woman shook her head as she watched Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing enter the little gate.</span><br><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing found themselves transported into a cavern right after stepping through the little gate. Not daring to let down their guard, they immediately employed their observation means. Chu Feng even took out his Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk.</span><br><span>Unfortunately, the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk wasn&rsquo;t working here either.</span><br><span>Nevertheless, Chu Feng could still tell that the cavern was extremely old. While it didn&rsquo;t trace so far back as the Ancient Era, it probably came into existence not too long later. There weren&rsquo;t any threats in their immediate surroundings just yet, but the area was likely to be enveloped in a powerful formation.</span><br><span>The two of them proceeded deeper into the cavern, but they still didn&rsquo;t encounter any danger. They eventually arrived before a stone door.</span><br><span>Words were inscribed by the sides of the stone door.</span><br><span>Nourish the item of this land with your psyche, but those who step beyond this door will find themselves with no path of retreat. The more you offer your psyche, the greater your reward, but offer too much and you may find yourself trapped.</span><br><span>Surprisingly, the message was signed off&mdash;Ancestral Martial Realm Sect.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was perplexed. He couldn&rsquo;t understand why someone would sign off as the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect here when this was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s territory. On top of that, the name also suggested that&hellip;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha! So, this is the territory of the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect! I thought that it belonged to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.&rdquo; Bai Yunqing revealed a disdainful smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What is the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother, you don&rsquo;t even know the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect? Are you sure that you&rsquo;re from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing was baffled.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I am indeed from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, but I&rsquo;m not too well-versed in its history.&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head. &ldquo;So, what is the Ancestral Martial Realm Sect?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh well, I guess it can&rsquo;t be helped. Big brother, I can tell you with utmost certainty right now that the strongest world spiritist organization after the Ancient Era isn&rsquo;t the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion but your Ancestral Martial Galaxy&rsquo;s Ancestral Martial Realm Sect.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It has fallen together with the Ancestral Martial Galaxy by now, but make no mistake, it was an entity that no one dared to cross back when it was at its peak. Its territories spanned across the vast world of cultivation. In fact, the biggest world spiritist remnant was left behind by them, and it&rsquo;s located in none other than our Totem Galaxy,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng was aware that the Ancestral Martial Starfield had its period of glory in the years following the Ancient Era, but he didn&rsquo;t think that it was to such an extent. To think that they actually had the strongest world spiritist organization whose influence spanned the entire world of cultivation in its peak!</span><br><span>It was no wonder why others looked down at the Ancestral Martial Galaxy now. They probably harbored a grudge toward the Ancestral Martial Galaxy for trampling all over them back then.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother, what do you think the item of this land is? Could it be the Life Crystal? But if all we have to do is to nourish the item of this land, why does it say that there&rsquo;s no path of retreat?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing was confused.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Let&rsquo;s go in first,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>He took the lead in stepping through the stone gate, and Bai Yunqing followed him. The two of them looked back and saw that the stone gate was still open, but a barrier had formed around it. The barrier was extremely strong; neither of them had the strength to </span><span>breach it.</span><br><span>A moment later, the barrier suddenly released two beams of light toward the two of them, though it stopped short of striking them. Taking a closer look, the two beams of light were actually transparent crystals.</span><br><span>These two crystals automatically floated to their side without them reaching out to grab them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It looks like there&rsquo;s really no path of retreat,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said with a sigh. The next moment, his eyes widened in astonishment. &ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, do you sense it?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, I sensed it too,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>A mysterious suction force had begun absorbing their psyche. It should have been painful for them to have their spirit power absorbed, but funnily enough, they felt exhilarated instead.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trap! It&rsquo;s trying to tempt us into releasing more of our psyche to be absorbed. There&rsquo;s no way I would fall for something like this!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said as he restricted the outflow of his psyche to the bare minimum.</span><br><span>But all of a sudden, his face turned warped in horror. &ldquo;Big brother, what are you doing?&rdquo;</span><br><span>To his shock, Chu Feng was releasing his psyche without any restraint, to the point where even the invisible suction force had started manifesting into beautiful flowers with vines around him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I have plenty of psyche,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Even so, you can&rsquo;t waste your psyche like that! There are other tests ahead!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing exclaimed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I need that Life Crystal, and I sense that it&rsquo;ll be much easier for me to win the acknowledgment of the Life Crystal if I satisfy this place&rsquo;s appetite,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t risk your life just for that darned crystal!&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Eggy. I know what I&rsquo;m doing. I have plenty of psyche to squander.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t lying. His psyche was much greater than that of other world spiritists, and the difference only grew as he further raised his spirit power. It might look like he was releasing a lot of psyche at the moment, but this was actually not a huge amount to him.</span><br><span>Soon, the cavern started to shake.</span><br><span>The flowers that had blossomed from devouring Chu Feng&rsquo;s psyche actually bowed to him before abruptly dissipating.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s stopped. The suction stopped! Big brother Chu Feng, could it be that you have satisfied this place&rsquo;s appetite?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked in astonishment.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It should be,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The hell! The color of your crystal has turned white as well whereas mine is still transparent.&rdquo; Bai Yunqing stared at the crystal floating around Chu Feng. &ldquo;Even the aura has changed too! It seems like this crystal can be used for cultivation. This must be what Jie Yu and the others are after. Could this trial be about exchanging one&rsquo;s psyche for </span><span>cultivation resources?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;That should be the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t hold myself back too much then. Otherwise, Jie Yu will say that I&rsquo;m beneath him once again later on,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>The two of them proceeded deeper into the cavern. Soon, they arrived at a palace that was filled to the brim with candles, though none of them were lit.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing had stopped restraining himself after learning that he could obtain cultivation resources by offering his psyche to this place. Naturally, Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t restrain his outflow of psyche either.</span><br><span>Moments after they entered the palace, the candles began lighting up.</span><br><span>This made them realize that they had to light up all of the candles to fully satisfy this palace&rsquo;s appetite, but the problem was that there were over ten thousand candles here. Bai Yunqing was already struggling just as they were reaching their first thousand candles.</span><br><span>Fortunately, the door at the other end of the palace opened after a thousand candles were lit, signaling that they could proceed ahead.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it anymore, big brother Chu Feng. I&rsquo;ll have to control my psyche a little, or else I won&rsquo;t be able to survive the entire trial.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing looked at his own crystal and saw that it had only turned halfway white. This meant that he was already struggling even though he had only used up half the amount of psyche that Chu Feng had offered earlier on.</span><br><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng continued releasing his psyche till all ten thousand candles were fully lit. It was only till the suction force in the palace vanished that he finally retracted his psyche.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother, are you a monster? Is there no limit to your psyche?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing exclaimed.</span><br><span>He realized that his worry was unfounded after seeing how Chu Feng&rsquo;s complexion remained unchanged even after single-handedly lighting up the remaining nine thousand candles in the palace. It was almost as if Chu Feng had an unlimited supply of psyche within him.</span><br></p></div>
