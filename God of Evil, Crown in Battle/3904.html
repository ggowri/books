        <h1>Chapter 3903</h1>
        <div> - Terrifying Everyone<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Who is this guy?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why is he so ugly?&rdquo;<br>The instant those Ancient Era&rsquo;s Organisms saw Chu Feng, they all looked to each other.<br>The Dog Nation was not very large, and practically everyone knew one another. As for Chu Feng, he was a stranger to all of them.<br>That said, they showed no signs of fear at Chu Feng. Instead, they were looking at him like he was a fool.<br>&lsquo;Ugly? Look at yourselves, you have the nerve to call me ugly?&rsquo;<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or cry after hearing those people&rsquo;s conversations.<br>However, upon thinking about it, he seemed to be able to understand why they'd said that.<br>After all, the aesthetic standards for every race differed. When Chu Feng had changed into their appearance, he did so at random.<br>Perhaps Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance was indeed rather ugly.<br>In fact, even Chu Feng himself didn&rsquo;t know what he looked like at the moment.<br>&ldquo;Milord, why&hellip; why would you come out?&rdquo;<br>Compared to the others, Gou Za looked to Chu Feng with a shocked expression.<br>From the complicated emotions in his eyes, Chu Feng was able to tell that Gou Za was extremely surprised by his appearance.<br>It was as if he felt from the very start that it was normal for Chu Feng to not come out. Instead, Chu Feng&rsquo;s decision to come out was abnormal.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re about to be beaten to death, did you expect your daddy I to just sit there and watch the show?&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;Milord, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Gou Za&rsquo;s body shook hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. His expression became even more complicated.<br>He had not been certain that Chu Feng had come out to help him when he saw him step outside the tent.<br>However, he was now certain that Chu Feng had come out to help him. Because of that, he felt completely shaken.<br>&ldquo;Milord? Which nameless brat dares to proclaim himself a lord?&rdquo;<br>Hearing Gou Za&rsquo;s address towards Chu Feng, Gou Zhen, his lackeys and even those bystanders all looked to Chu Feng with contempt.<br>Seeing that the crowd were actually all mocking Chu Feng, Gou Za immediately shouted, &ldquo;Do not be rude! That person is a lord from the Soldier Clan!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord from the Soldier Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The crowd all burst into laughter upon hearing those words. Especially Gou Zhen; he laughed the loudest.<br>Suddenly, Gou Zhen&rsquo;s expression turned gloomy. He stared fiercely at Gou Za and spoke with a threatening tone, &ldquo;Gou Za, do you take me as someone who has never met the lords of the Soldier Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could the lords of the Soldier Clan be wearing rubbish like his?&rdquo;<br>Gou Zhen looked to Chu Feng. His gaze grew even more gloomy. &ldquo;Brat, you dare to pretend to be a lord from the Soldier Clan?! You&rsquo;ve committed a capital offense!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng realized why they did not believe him to be from the Soldier Clan.<br>Likely, it was due to his outfit.<br>Chju Feng had no idea what sort of outfit the people from the Soldier Nation and General Nation wore.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s outfit was merely something that he had created at random using his imagination.<br>However, judging from what that Gou Zhen had said, the people from the Soldier Clan seemed to wear some sort of special outfit.<br>The reason why they felt that Chu Feng was not from the Soldier Clan was because his outfit was incorrect.<br>&ldquo;Your name is Gou Zhen, right?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Your daddy I am indeed called Gou Zhen. What about it?&rdquo; asked Gou Zhen with a look of contempt.<br>&ldquo;Gou Zhen and Gou Zhen&rsquo;s lackeys, look carefully at your surroundings.<br>&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What is this guy implying?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words not only confused Gou Zhen and his lackeys, but even confused the bystanders.<br>&ldquo;For it will be the last time you all will get to see them,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng said those words, before the crowd could react, an enormous oppressive might rushed out from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body and swept forth. It instantly covered the surroundings.<br>However, that was not what was important. What was important was that that oppressive might had clear-cut targets.<br>Gou Zhen and his lackeys were the targets of that oppressive might.<br>The oppressive might turned into a martial power wall. It sealed off Gou Zhen and his lackeys from all directions. After that, it began to press down onto them.<br>The pressing oppressive might destined what would follow.<br>&ldquo;Bang, bang, bang~~~&rdquo;<br>A series of muffled explosions could be heard. At the same time, blood splattered explosively.<br>Gou Zhen and all of his lackeys were turned into blood that scattered all over the ground.<br>Some of the bystanders that were near Gou Zhen and his lackeys found themselves covered completely in blood.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This, this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the bystanders were completely terrified. Many people fell directly onto their butts. Some had their facial expressions completely twisted from fear. Some were so terrified that they opened their mouths and lost consciousness.<br>In fact, it was not only those bystanders. Even Gou Za and his grandmother were terrified.<br>In an instant, Gou Zhen and his lackeys had all been killed.<br>Such ruthlessness was something that they&rsquo;d never witnessed before, even from the lords of the Soldier Clan.<br>After all, Gou Zhen and his lackeys were all living people.<br>&ldquo;Is there anyone else that doubts your daddy&rsquo;s identity now?&rdquo;<br>After killing Gou Zhen and his lackeys, Chu Feng turned his cold gaze to the bystanders.<br>&ldquo;This lowly one pays his respects to Milord.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, we were blind as bats and acting like snobs. Milord, please don&rsquo;t lower yourself to our level.&rdquo;<br>The bystanders all kneeled on the ground.<br>As matters stood, they believed that Chu Feng was a lord of the Soldier Nation.<br>The reason for that was because his strength was something that they, the people from the Dog Nation, could not possibly attain in their entire lives.<br>&ldquo;Listen carefully. Gou Za is my friend. If anyone dares to make things difficult for him again, you will suffer the same fate as Gou Zhen and his lackeys,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please rest assured. We wouldn&rsquo;t dare. Even if we are given a hundred nerves, we still wouldn&rsquo;t dare.&rdquo;<br>Those people were smashing their foreheads into the ground repeatedly as if they were pounding garlic as they spoke. They were truly terrified to death by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please don&rsquo;t make things difficult for them. My neighbors treat Gou Za and myself rather well.&rdquo;<br>Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother actually pleaded for those people.<br>&ldquo;Grandmother, I have no intention to make things difficult for them. I am merely giving them a warning.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If they do not make things difficult for you, I guarantee you that they will be fine. However, if they are to make things difficult for Gou Za and you, I guarantee that they will not be fine,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng helped Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother back into Gou Za&rsquo;s residence.<br>&ldquo;Milord, truly, thank you for today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After what Milord said here today, likely no one in the Dog Nation will dare cause trouble for us again,&rdquo; Gou Za said to Chu Feng with a look of gratitude.<br>&ldquo;Me killing them won&rsquo;t cause any trouble for you, right?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Of course not, of course not. In our Dog Nation, people&rsquo;s lives are akin to grass. Even if we are killed by others in the Dog Nation, no one will care. As for Milord, you&rsquo;re a lord of the Soldier Nation. Who would possibly dare to bother with your killings?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, Gou Zhen and his lackeys were a bunch of scoundrels to begin with. No one will be concerned with their death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Gou Za started hesitating after saying those words.<br>&ldquo;Merely what? Speak away,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Although the Dog Nation is not very large, people die every day here. People dying is a common occurrence to us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it is the first time that I&rsquo;ve witnessed so many people being killed at once. Truth be told, I also feel slightly afraid,&rdquo; said Gou Za.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know how to respond after hearing those words.<br>After all, killing many people at once instantly was generally what he would do when killing people weaker than him.<br>He would not bother with superfluous words, and would kill them directly. Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know how Gou Za and the others conducted their killings.<br>Could it be that they would beat their victims to death?<br>Likely, compared to being beaten to death, Chu Feng&rsquo;s instant killing would be more humane. At least, those that died would not have to suffer too much pain for too long.<br>Of course, in terms of visual impact, Chu Feng&rsquo;s method was indeed crueler.<br>After all, having one&rsquo;s body explode would leave not even an intact corpse. One&rsquo;s soul would also be completely destroyed.<br>&ldquo;Gou Za, the way I see it, you&rsquo;re not unafraid of death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, why would you refuse when that Gou Zhen said he would spare you and your grandmother should you join him?&rdquo;<br>The reason why Chu Feng asked that was because he was curious as to why Gou Za had made that decision.<br></p></div>
