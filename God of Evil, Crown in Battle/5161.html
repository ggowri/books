        <h1>Chapter 5160</h1>
        <div>: Unsatisfactory Answer<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Elder, please come out and lead the way for me.&rdquo;<br>In the midst of chasing after Song Yuwei, Chu Feng sensed that her movements had come to a halt. That made him feel even more worried.<br>The Asura King was able to lend his powers to Chu Feng, but rank four Half-God level was the cap for him. If he wanted to go any further than that, he needed the Asura King to personally come out and utilize his Heaven-defying Battle Power.<br>The Asura King quickly did as he was told and bolted ahead with Chu Feng in hand.<br>A while later, Chu Feng discovered that Song Yuwei had started moving again. He had no idea where Song Yuwei was heading, but he continued chasing after her at full speed. Soon, he realized that Song Yuwei was making her way toward the ancient city where they had first dropped by to acquire news on the ancient remnant.<br>In truth, Song Yuwei was indeed heading toward the ancient city.<br>While torturing Song Yuwei, Situ Tingye searched her body and found a token that allowed her to freely enter the city lord&rsquo;s residence. That led him to suspect that Song Yuwei was on close ties with City Lord Liang, so they began making their way over.<br>Unfortunately, Situ Tingye suddenly received orders to return to the Situ World Spiritist Clan, so they decided to divide their team into two. He entrusted the job of investing City Lord Liang to the other elders.<br>Even so, the army from the Situ World Spiritist Clan that was heading toward the ancient city was not to be made light of. There were two Gray Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, ten White Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, and over nine thousand elites.<br>They naturally drew attention when they entered the ancient city, not to mention that there was a bound bloodied figure carried at the front of the procession.<br>The crowd swiftly realized that the Situ World Spiritist Clan had come with malicious intentions. Their first instinct was to flee, but there was no chance for them to do so.<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen had constructed a massive barrier to seal off the entire city as soon as they arrived. Only those who had reached rank one Half-God would be able to breach the barrier.<br>&ldquo;Milords, I didn&rsquo;t know that you were coming. Please pardon me for my lack of hospitality!&rdquo;<br>City Lord Liang quickly showed himself. He didn&rsquo;t hesitate to kowtow to the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen, putting on a subservient attitude. There was no other choice. The Situ World Spiritist Clan was the overlord of this starfield, after all.<br>Pah!<br>A bloodied figure was tossed right in front of City Lord Liang. City Lord Liang widened his eyes. He could hardly conceal the sorrow in his eyes.<br>There was no way he wouldn&rsquo;t recognize the bloodied figure. It was Song Yuwei.<br>It was just that Song Yuwei was in a tragic state. Her eyes had been blinded, and her facial features had been distorted. All that was left of her body were stumps of her limbs and bits of flesh hanging off her white bones.<br>There were many venomous worms wriggling inside her body. This was a torture method. It must have been unimaginably painful, but Song Yuwei didn&rsquo;t let out any cries at all.<br>Or rather, she didn&rsquo;t even have the strength to cry at all. Even breathing was tough for her.<br>However, the most tragic thing of all was her wounded dantian. Her cultivation was seeping away from her. There was nothing worse than that to a cultivator, considering given the many years they had to devote to their training in order to reach their current levels.<br>City Lord Liang had already noticed Song Yuwei before he came out, and he had mentally prepared himself for the worst. Even so, Song Yuwei&rsquo;s tragic plight was still a huge blow to him. His eyes started to redden.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crying? City Lord Liang, it looks like you do recognize her.&rdquo;<br>A Gray Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist of the group eyed the kneeling City Lord Liang. He went by the name of Situ Xiangyang, and he was one of the elders of the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>&ldquo;Lord Xiangyang, I don&rsquo;t recognize her!&rdquo; City Lord Liang lied.<br>He dared not to reveal the truth, not when he knew deep well how Song Yuwei landed in her current state. She must have gone to the ancient remnant to find the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen despite his warning.<br>If he admitted that he recognized Song Yuwei now, there was no doubt that the Situ World Spiritist Clan would slaughter him and his entire clan.<br>&ldquo;What are you crying for if you don&rsquo;t recognize her?&rdquo; a black-faced elder beside Situ Xiangyang hollered.<br>He was Situ Jianling, an elder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan too. He was also a Gray Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I really don&rsquo;t recognize her! I was born cowardly, so I can&rsquo;t help but feel squeamish at such sights. Please pardon my weakness,&rdquo; City Lord Liang replied as he wiped off his tears.<br>He was trying to say that his reaction was out of shock, not because he recognized Lord Yuwei.<br>&ldquo;Do you take me for a fool? Do you think that your crude lies can deceive me?&rdquo;<br>Situ Jianling didn&rsquo;t buy into his story at all. He raised his hand to strike City Lord Liang, but Situ Xiangyang suddenly grabbed his hand and stopped him.<br>Situ Xiangyang glanced at Situ Jianling and gestured to him not to make a move first before turning his attention to City Lord Liang.<br>&ldquo;City Lord Liang, you are a meritorious subject who has done a lot for our Situ World Spiritist Clan. This person hasn&rsquo;t committed a grievous crime; she merely offendedus. We came here because we found your token on her. If you recognize her, we might consider sparing her life on your account. It&rsquo;s good that you don&rsquo;t recognize her. There&rsquo;s no reason for us to spare her then.&rdquo;<br>Situ Xiangyang raised his hand, and Song Yuwei was dragged into mid-air. An execution platform made out of spirit power manifested around Song Yuwei, locking her firmly in place.<br>It would be an incredibly ugly death if Song Yuwei was killed through this execution platform. Seeing that she was really going to die, City Lord Liang hesitated. He knew that it was a trap, but he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to watch as Song Yuwei died before his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please wait a moment!&rdquo; he cried out.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, City Lord Liang?&rdquo;<br>Situ Xiangyang looked at City Lord Liang with a sharp glint in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I have made a mistake. At a closer glance, I do recognize her. She&rsquo;s one of my guests. She isn&rsquo;t a bad person at heart, so may I ask you to be so gracious as to spare her life?&rdquo; City Lord Liang pleaded.<br>&ldquo;Since she&rsquo;s City Lord Liang&rsquo;s guest, I guess we can consider sparing her life. If I may ask, City Lord Liang, do you know her name?&rdquo; Situ Xiangyang asked.<br>&ldquo;Milord, this humble one only knows that her family name is Song. I&rsquo;m not sure what her full name is,&rdquo; City Lord Liang replied.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t? Well, City Lord Liang, I do know her full name. She&rsquo;s Song Yuwei, a wretched survivor of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect. She didn&rsquo;t just verbally affront us today. She secretly tailed us with malicious intentions at heart. I should also add that she has already confessed to me that she was here and that you&rsquo;re her accomplice!&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Situ Xiangyang exerted a heavy oppressive might that covered the entire ancient city.<br>Wu!<br>Song Yuwei&rsquo;s body suddenly started wriggling as she made harrumphing noises. She wanted to tell City Lord Liang that Situ Xiangyang was deceiving him, and that she hadn&rsquo;t told anything to the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen.<br>It was a pity that a formation had been cast on her. Even speaking was impossible for her, let alone doing voice transmissions.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I really don&rsquo;t know who she is!&rdquo; City Lord Liang exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;City Lord Liang, I believe that you wouldn&rsquo;t dare to do anything that is to the detriment of our Situ World Spiritist Clan. She must have coerced you to help her. As long as you tell me where Song Yuwei&rsquo;s accomplice is, I&rsquo;ll not only absolve you of your crimes but even reward you. However, if you obstinately choose to keep your mouth shut, I&rsquo;ll execute you and your clan members.<br>&ldquo;Remember, City Lord Liang. This is the only chance I&rsquo;m giving you. I hope that you&rsquo;ll speak wisely. I&rsquo;m not going to be that nice anymore if your answer doesn&rsquo;t satisfy me,&rdquo; Situ Xiangyang said as he released his killing intent.<br>City Lord Liang fell into a dilemma. He could tell that the Situ World Spiritist Clan had come with the intention of forcing a confession out of him by hook or by crook. It was unlikely that he would get out of this alive.<br>However, there might still be a sliver of hope if he sold out Chu Feng. The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen weren&rsquo;t really known for honoring their promises, but that would at least be better than nothing.<br>Not to mention, it was not just his life that was at stake here. His clan members would be dragged down as well.<br>Despite everything that was at stake, he still shook his head in the end.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I really don&rsquo;t know anything at all. I dare not hide anything from you. I&rsquo;m begging you, please let me off!&rdquo; City Lord Liang cried out.<br>He had decided against betraying Song Yuwei and Chu Feng over a glimmer of hope.<br>&ldquo;How regrettable. City Lord Liang, I find your answer unsatisfactory. Men, drag out all of City Lord Liang&rsquo;s clan members and execute them!&rdquo;<br>The nine thousand Situ World Spiritist Clansmen immediately drew their weapons, ready to carry out a massacre.<br>Boom!<br>A thunderous roar suddenly echoed from the distance. Black gaseous flames reminiscent of an ominous cloud were swiftly approaching the ancient city.<br></p></div>
