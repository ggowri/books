        <div> - The Villa Master&rsquo;s Invitation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Your eyes feeling uncomfortable?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Song Xi.<br>Chu Feng naturally knew that Song Xi was crying. However, he did not want to make the situation excessively embarrassing for Song Xi. Thus, he could only call Song Xi&rsquo;s attention like this. As a man, it was best to not cry so easily.<br>&ldquo;Hehe, I was truly too overwhelmed with emotions and excitement. I was actually&hellip; invited by the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master. I was truly unable to contain myself,&rdquo; Song Xi started to wipe away his tears as he spoke out the reason why he was crying without trying to hide anything.<br>&ldquo;Haha, little friend, there&rsquo;s no need for you to be this emotional. As you are friends with little friend Chu Feng, there will likely be a lot of powers in additional to our Immortal Armament Villa that will invite you in the future,&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said with a smile.<br>At that moment, the others present, including Song Xi, all began to laugh.<br>However, the crowd had no idea that the actual reason why Song Xi cried was not because he was invited by the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master.<br>Rather, it was because Chu Feng said that he, Song Xi, was his friend before all those people. Furthermore, he had even insisted on bringing him along after receiving the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master&rsquo;s invitation.<br>This allowed Song Xi to know that he was someone of importance in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart, that Chu Feng was really considering him a friend, and not merely taking pity on him.<br>Thus, Song Xi was actually crying because he was moved by Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng had entered the Immortal Armament Villa.<br>Although they were both invited, Chu Feng and Song Xi were still separated. The reason for that was because the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master needed to chat with Chu Feng in private.<br>Chu Feng had already anticipated all this. Thus, he did not refuse. The reason for that was because he was certain that the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master would not harm him.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what is it that you want to ask me? There is no harm in you telling me what it is directly. As long as it&rsquo;s something that this junior can tell you, this junior will definitely tell you,&rdquo; Chu Feng took the initiative and spoke to the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master.<br>&ldquo;Haha. Little friend Chu Feng is truly a clever individual. That said, it&rsquo;s no wonder either. After all, being intelligent is generally a trait that geniuses possess. As for someone like you, a genius among geniuses, a person that others view to be a demon-level genius, that is even more likely to be the case,&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master smiled faintly.<br>Then, he said, &ldquo;I wish to know which Upper Realm and which Heavenly Clan little friend Chu Feng is from.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This junior is from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,&rdquo; Chu Feng said. He did not try to conceal this matter.<br>&ldquo;Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?&rdquo; Even the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master was somewhat surprised upon hearing those words.<br>He had thought about many Upper Realms, and was practically certain that Chu Feng should be from a power ruling over a certain Upper Realm.<br>Yet, the answer Chu Feng presented him was actually the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Furthermore, Chu Feng had such a serious expression on his face, and didn&rsquo;t seem to be lying. Naturally, he would be astonished.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng is actually from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. In that case, you are truly a rarely-seen genius.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, little friend Chu Feng, it would mean that you do not possess relatives in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm or the other Upper Realms?&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master asked.<br>&ldquo;That could be considered to be the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke those words in a very skimpy manner. He did not present a clear answer.<br>However, the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master instead felt that Chu Feng had presented him a definite answer.<br>&ldquo;If that is the case, this old man has a request. I wonder if little friend Chu Feng might be able to help this old man with it,&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>&ldquo;Senior is truly one to joke around. You are the grand Villa Master of the Immortal Armament Villa. How could this Chu Feng possibly be able to be of help to you?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;This request of mine is something that only you can help me with.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the expression on the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master changed. The gaze with which he looked to Chu Feng seemed to be filled with light, filled with anticipation.<br>&ldquo;Senior Villa Master, could it be that you want this junior to join the Immortal Armament Villa?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That is precisely it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, might you be willing?&rdquo;<br>Originally, both Chu Feng and the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master were sitting. However, as he spoke, the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master actually stood up. From this, Chu Feng was able to tell that he was truly emotional.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I am truly sorry. This junior does not plan on joining,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>Hearing those words, the eyes of the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master that were originally shining brightly immediately grew much dimmer.<br>However, he did not immediately give up because of this. Instead, he added, &ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, if you are willing to join our Immortal Armament Villa, this old man is willing to take you as my personal disciple. I will raise you as our Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s future Villa Master.&rdquo;<br>Truth be told, it would be a lie if Chu Feng was to say that he wasn&rsquo;t tempted upon hearing those words.<br>After arriving in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, Chu Feng could be said to have been left to his own devices. In a place filled with dangers like this, it would be very difficult for a weak individual like him to survive.<br>As for the Immortal Armament Villa, although they could not be considered to be a top rated power in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they still possessed some power and weight.<br>If he was able to become the Immortal Armament VIlla&rsquo;s VIlla Master&rsquo;s personal disciple, merely that title would become a great protective talisman for him.<br>Unfortunately, Chu Feng did not plan to join any power.<br>Thus, Chu Feng still shook his head. He said, &ldquo;This Chu Feng appreciates senior&rsquo;s kindness. Merely, I truly have no plans to join any power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that our Immortal Armament Villa is unable to fancy little friend Chu Feng,&rdquo; At that moment, not only did the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master have a dim and downcast expression in his eyes, there was also disappointed present in them. Furthermore, his lips were raised into a self-mocking smile as he sighed.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this Chu Feng is most definitely not despising the Immortal Armament Villa. Merely, this junior once vowed that I would never join any power. Thus, I hope that senior can forgive me,&rdquo; Chu Feng stood up and bowed to the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master. There was also an ashamed expression on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>After all, being able to become the disciple of the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master was something that countless people dreamed about.<br>It was truly somewhat undiscriminating for Chu Feng to refuse it.<br>&ldquo;You truly do not plan to join any power?&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master asked.<br>&ldquo;That is correct. Senior, if you do not trust me, you can watch my each and every move,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I do, this old man trusts you.&rdquo; At that moment, the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master had given up on having Chu Feng join the Immortal Armament Villa.<br>Not only did the disappointment on his face disappear, but he once again revealed a smile.<br>He was disappointed because he had thought that Chu Feng despised their Immortal Armament Villa. Thus, it had hurt his pride.<br>However, upon verifying that it was not that Chu Feng despised their Immortal Armament Villa, but that he truly did not plan to join any power, that displeasurable sensation also disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, if this old man didn&rsquo;t guess wrong, you should be at the peak of Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, and are only missing an opportunity to break through the barrier to become a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, right?&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior&rsquo;s eyesight is truly amazing. It is as senior said, this Chu Feng is only a fine line away from becoming a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Merely, it seems that this obstruction is not that easy to break through,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>The All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart was not only capable of giving martial comprehension, but it was also capable of giving comprehension in world spirit techniques.<br>Actually, the strengthening of the Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler had contributed greatly to Chu Feng&rsquo;s massive progress in his world spirit techniques.<br>However, Chu Feng was able to tell that it would not be that simple for him to break through to Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. In fact, it would be even more difficult than achieving a breakthrough in martial cultivation.<br>&ldquo;This old man is, after all, a Dragon Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist. If I am unable to tell even these, then I would have been the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master in vain.&rdquo;<br>The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master smiled faintly. Then, he said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Since this old man was correct in my observation, then this old man needs to present little friend Chu Feng with a gift.&rdquo;<br>As the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master spoke, he took out a title plate. That title plate seemed to be made of glass. It was very ordinary-looking.<br>However, upon closer observation, Chu Feng discovered that the title plate was very extraordinary. The title plate was actually a very powerful spirit formation.<br><br><br></p></div>
