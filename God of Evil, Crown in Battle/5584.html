        <h1>Chapter 5584: I Hope He’s Still Alive</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend, you have excellent talents and a good character. I have been around since the Ancient Era, and I can say that there are very few people like you. Fate brought us together, and you have helped me enter the Immemorial Star Sea and achieve my goal. While I can&rsquo;t share the Immemorial Star Sea&rsquo;s treasure with you, I can&rsquo;t allow you to work in vain. This place is a remnant that has existed since the Ancient Era. I believe it&rsquo;ll be of help to you,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar&rsquo;s voice echoed in Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a map surfaced in Chu Feng&rsquo;s head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;May we meet again.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaotic Era Scholar&rsquo;s voice came to a halt at that point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, did he leave you with the map for the remnant?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could hear what Chu Feng did, but she couldn&rsquo;t sense what was inside Chu Feng&rsquo;s head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s a map in my mind,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like Chaotic Era Scholar still has a conscience,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng told Little Fishy about what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I guess Chaotic Era Scholar isn&rsquo;t a bad person, after all,&rdquo; Little Fishy complimented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a disturbance broke out from the crowd gathered in the distance. The Immemorial Star Sea was starting to disappear, and it didn&rsquo;t take long before it vanished. Only the entrance stone monument remained, but only </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s</span><span> name was left on it now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd began speculating what had happened for the Immemorial Star Sea to vanish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big brother, do you think that the Immemorial Star Sea has vanished into thin air, or that Chaotic Era Scholar has taken it away with him?&rdquo; Little Fishy asked out of curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to say,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied, though he thought that both were possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the power inside the Immemorial Star Sea was astonishing, Chaotic Era </span><span>Scholar was shockingly powerful too. In fact, even the casual means Chaotic Era Scholar had employed were easily the most powerful means Chu Feng had seen to date.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could say for certain now that Chaotic Era Scholar was definitely one of the strongest </span><span>world</span><span> spiritists in the Ancient Era, a figure who stood at the top of the Ancient Era. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been too surprising for him to be able to take the entire Immemorial Star Sea away with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> face darkened. She opened her palm, revealing an imprint on it. She then turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Big brother, I have to leave for a moment. Can you wait here for me?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for you,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Make sure to wait for me. I&rsquo;ll be right back!&rdquo; Little Fishy said before taking her leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng wanted to look for the Totem Dragon Clansmen and inform them about what he had encountered in the Immemorial Star Sea, but he decided to wait around for Little Fishy since he had already made a promise to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Chaotic Era Scholar, the black aura monster, and Jie Tian were standing in the aerial space above the Immemorial Star Sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jie Tian stared at Chaotic Era Scholar with shocked eyes. He had just seen with his own eyes Chaotic Era Scholar taking out an empty painting and stowing the entire Immemorial Star Sea into it. He had never seen such means before, even in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew right away that there was no one in the world of cultivation who could rival the man before him, unless it was&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Jie Tian,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar suddenly looked at Jie Tian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder,&rdquo; Jie Tian immediately replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you willing to become my disciple?&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, I am. Jie Tian is willing to take elder as my master.&rdquo; Jie Tian immediately nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for him to become the disciple of such a powerful figure. He would even say that this was a fortuitous encounter greater than the secret in the palace. Without any hesitation, he kneeled down before Chaotic Era Scholar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master, please accept my kowtow.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jie Tian readied himself to kowtow to Chaotic Era Scholar, but the latter suddenly reached out and stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;No rush,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t qualified to become my disciple yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, I know that my talent is lacking, but I&rsquo;ll work hard so as to not let you down. I vow that I won&rsquo;t embarrass you,&rdquo; Jie Tian said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaotic Era Scholar chuckled at Jie Tian&rsquo;s assurance before asking, &ldquo;Jie Tian, who do you think is stronger&mdash;you or Chu Feng?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jie Tian fell silent at that question. While he was reluctant to accept the outcome, he </span><span>had to concede that he had lost to Chu Feng in all the conflicts they had&hellip; and Chaotic Era Scholar knew that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to say that he was weaker than Chu Feng, but he would be lying to himself if he said that he was stronger than Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you know why you pale in comparison to Chu Feng?&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That man is a scheming one. I&rsquo;m lacking in worldly experience,&rdquo; Jie Tian replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so. You&rsquo;re lacking because there&rsquo;s a fault in your foundation. You possess one of the best bloodlines, so why are you borrowing one from others?&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, y-you can tell that my Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline isn&rsquo;t mine?&rdquo; Jie Tian asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course. The Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline is formidable, but your Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline is impure and flawed, and it doesn&rsquo;t belong to you. You can use it as your foundation, but you&rsquo;ll likely achieve more if you develop your own bloodline instead,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, I&hellip;&rdquo; Jie Tian looked conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I can help you if you choose to develop your own bloodline instead. Of course, I&rsquo;ll also help you if you insist on developing the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline, but you&rsquo;ll be treading on a more difficult path,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, I wish to continue developing the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline. I&rsquo;ll slave off for you to repay this debt if you are really willing to help you,&rdquo; Jie Tian said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said. With a wave of his sleeves, he conjured two paintings and first passed one of them to Jie Tian. &ldquo;Cultivate according to this painting. It&rsquo;ll grant you a better grasp of the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then passed the second painting over and said, &ldquo;Hold onto this painting. I&rsquo;ll take you as my disciple should we meet again in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Thank you, elder.&rdquo; Jie Tian accepted the paintings and stowed them away. &ldquo;Elder, where should I look for you in the future?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You may find me in the Ninth Galaxy,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The Ninth Galaxy? The Immemorial Domain of Gods?&rdquo; Jie Tian asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, those who choose to enter the Immemorial Domain of Gods never return. Do you know what&rsquo;s in there?&rdquo; Jie Tian asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You should uncover that yourself instead of asking questions,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, where do I find you in the Immemorial Domain of Gods?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That depends on fate.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, may I tell others about you?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You may.&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said before he disappeared together with the black aura monster with a wave of his sleeves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Farewell, elder.&rdquo; Jie Tian bowed deeply even though Chaotic Era Scholar was already gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Chaotic Era Scholar and the black aura monster had left the realm and were traveling across vast space on a little boat. The boat traveled at an </span><span>inconceivable speed comparable to a shooting star, racing toward the Ninth Galaxy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Milord, what&rsquo;s the secret of the Immemorial Star Sea?&rdquo; the black aura monster asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet, but it should still be in the palace. I really ought to thank that thing. She had entered the Star Sea Realm ahead of me and forced it to channel the bulk of its spirit power on suppressing her. If not for that, there&rsquo;s no way I could have taken the entire Immemorial Star Sea away with me just like that,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you talking about that existence that snuck into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body? What is it?&rdquo; the black aura monster asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a being from the Immemorial Era. What entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was just a sliver of its existence. It has been controlled by Chu Feng&rsquo;s bloodline, so I doubt that it&rsquo;d be able to hurt him,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Milord, why did you choose to take Jie Tian as your disciple instead of Chu Feng? Chu Feng clearly possesses greater talent,&rdquo; the black aura monster asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng has inherited that man&rsquo;s legacy, so he ought to become that man&rsquo;s disciple instead,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you talking about the World Spiritist Emperor&rsquo;s legacy?&rdquo; the black aura monster asked in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That explains how he was able to grasp formations that quickly,&rdquo; the black aura monster remarked in realization as a cold gleam flashed across his eyes. &ldquo;Milord, why do you keep him around if he&rsquo;s the World Spiritist Emperor&rsquo;s successor?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do I kill those who aren&rsquo;t of use to me? You have been with me for so many years, but you really don&rsquo;t know me at all,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; the black aura monster protested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;My grudge against Qin Jiu has nothing to do with others,&rdquo; Chaotic Era Scholar insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo; The black aura monster relented with a nod. It quickly remembered something and asked, &ldquo;Milord, is the World Spiritist Emperor still alive?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint flashed across Chaotic Era Scholar&rsquo;s eyes as he said, &ldquo;I do hope that he&rsquo;s still alive.&rdquo;</span></p></div>
