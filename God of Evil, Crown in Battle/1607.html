        <h1>Chapter 1607</h1>
        <div> - Forming A Blood Feud<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Ahhh~~~~&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the crowd were all shocked, another scream sounded from above the sky. The light of world spirit power radiated all around. Then, a dragon formed with spirit power ruthlessly smashed that Beitang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s shameless man into the sea.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~~&rdquo;<br>Water splattered everywhere like dragons soaring out from the sea. At the moment when that shameless man floated back to the surface of the water, his appearance was so battered that he had become like a dog that had fallen into water.<br>At this moment, the crowd was in absolute silence. The bystanders were all stunned by this scene. Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent was simply much stronger than they ever imagined it to be. He, a rank nine Martial King, had relied on world spirit power to defeat a rank three Half Martial Emperor. Furthermore, this rank three Half Martial Emperor was from the Beitang Imperial Clan. What sort of strength was this? How powerful must his world spirit techniques be?<br>Chu Feng did not fail to live up to the name of being a genius. A lot of people present now had a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng.<br>However, what shocked them the most was how ruthless Chu Feng was. His methods had completely and utterly humiliated the Beitang Imperial Clan, causing them to lose all face.<br>&ldquo;Beitang Zimo, is this result to your satisfaction?&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to Beitang Zimo and asked while smiling beamingly.<br>At this moment, Beitang Zimo had a twisted expression on his face. It was as if he had eaten dog shit. Unreconciliation, anger and humiliation had nearly driven this Beitang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s prince mad.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, we shall wait and see,&rdquo; In the end, Beitang Zimo left those threatening words before turning around to leave.<br>Following him, the rest of the Beitang Imperial Clan also left. Chu Feng noticed that all of them looked at him with expressions of extreme ill-intent as they left. Especially that Martial Emperor by the name of Beitang Zhiqiang. The gaze that he looked to Chu Feng with was filled with anger.<br>The dignity of the Beitang Imperial Clan was not something that they would allow others to trample on. Yet, the things that Chu Feng had done today had not only trampled upon their dignity, they had also been a naked humiliation.<br>To the Beitang Imperial Clan, this was something that they could not forgive. A blood feud between Chu Feng and the Beitang Imperial Clan had been set. To be honest, this was not what Chu Feng desired. After all, the current Chu Feng was still very weak and did not possess the strength to contend against a colossus like the Beitang Imperial Clan.<br>However, there was nothing that he could do about it. The blood feud today had not been formed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s earlier actions. Rather, it was formed the moment Chu Feng had met Beitang Zimo for the first time.<br>What sort of person was Beitang Zimo? He was an extremely conceited individual. Not only did he not place others in his eyes, he did not even place others&rsquo; lives in his eyes.<br>He had harbored a grudge against Chu Feng the very moment he had seen him. The thought to eliminate Chu Feng had immediately entered his mind. As for the reason why that was the case, it was because Chu Feng was close to Tantai Xue and Tantai Xue was someone whom he had taken a fancy to.<br>Since that Beitang Zimo was not planning to let Chu Feng live, then Chu Feng would also not let him have an easy time either.<br>Thus, after Beitang Zimo&rsquo;s continued provocations, Chu Feng had finally erupted. Today, taking advantage of the fact that the Nangong Imperial Clan and the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts were behind his back, Chu Feng had counterattacked and utterly humiliated the Beitang Imperial Clan.<br>Today, not only had Chu Feng trampled upon the Beitang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s honor and displayed his talent, he would also raise his own achievements and reputation by stepping on the Beitang Imperial Clan.<br>There was no small number of people present here today. Likely, Chu Feng&rsquo;s name would soon spread throughout the Overlord Domain.<br>He was a genius who had not only obtained the best records in the Weaponry Bestowment Assembly, he had also revealed his mighty powers after being provoked by the Beitang Imperial Clan. Using his rank nine Martial King cultivation, he had defeated a Beitang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s rank three Half Martial Emperor. His battle power was overflowing and simply incomparable.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve truly made me have a whole new level of respect for you. Never would I have imagined that your world spirit techniques would be this powerful,&rdquo; Yaojiao Tingyu walked over to Chu Feng. Evidently, she had not expected Chu Feng to be a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>One must know that it was extremely rare for someone of Chu Feng&rsquo;s age to become a Royal-cloak World Spiritist. As for those who were able to become Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists like him, it was likely that there was no one in the entire Holy Land of Martialism. Thus, even if Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power were disregarded, merely his world spirit techniques would place him on the level of a true genius. As long as there were no accidents, he would definitely become an extremely powerful individual in the future. Perhaps, within a thousand years, Chu Feng&rsquo;s name would be among the Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists of the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Princess Tingyu, for your help,&rdquo; Chu Feng expressed his thanks while smiling. If Chu Feng had already felt Yaojiao Tingyu&rsquo;s sincerity in wanting to befriend him from the scale title plate, then her actions today had made her sincerity known even more clearly. Chu Feng&rsquo;s impression of her became even more favorable.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, if you consider me, Yaojiao Tingyu, as a friend, then do not act this courteously.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Chu Feng, after what happened today, I believe the Beitang Imperial Clan will not let matters go. If they are to truly come to create trouble for you and you are unable to handle them, you can come to our King Monstrous Dragon Race. Even though our King Monstrous Dragon Race does not dare to declare ourselves to be the strongest in the Holy Land of Martialism, we have never placed the Beitang Imperial Clan in our eyes. If you come to our domain, I can guarantee your safety,&rdquo; Yaojiao Tingyu said.<br>After hearing those words, not to mention Chu Feng being surprised, even the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan and the bystanders were all shocked.<br>None of them had ever thought that the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts would fancy Chu Feng to this degree. They were simply willing to become enemies with the Beitang Imperial Clan for the sake of befriending Chu Feng.<br>However, regardless of how talented Chu Feng might be, he was still only a rank nine Martial King. Compared to the Beitang Imperial Clan, Chu Feng was simply unable to withstand a single blow. For the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts to make such a decision, they simply had not thought matters through. It seemed to be extremely unwise.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng has remembered Princess Tingyu&rsquo;s kindness in his heart,&rdquo; Truth be told, Chu Feng could not be certain as to whether the words spoken by Yaojiao Tingyu were true or not. However, the fact that she could say those sorts of words before all these people made Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart feel warmth.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, in that case, we shall go our separate ways. If you have the time in the future, you must definitely come and visit our King Monstrous Dragon Race,&rdquo; Yaojiao Tingyu said.<br>&ldquo;Definitely,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist respectfully. After that, under Yaojiao Tingyu&rsquo;s lead, the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts left this seaside.<br>Even though the strongest individual among the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts on this journey was that Martial Emperor-level expert, it was clear that Yaojiao Tingyu was the person with the most noble status.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, allow me to introduce you. This is Aunt Lian,&rdquo; Nangong Ya walked over. Nangong Baihe and the others had walked over with him. Furthermore, that Martial Emperor from the Nangong Imperial Clan had also walked over with them.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, we met at an earlier time,&rdquo; that Martial Emperor by the name of Nangong Lian said with a beaming smile.<br>Indeed, she had met Chu Feng already. It had been on that day when they had entered the storm in the sea. Even though they had not greeted each other, they had indeed met one another.<br>Compared to that day, the attitude Nangong Lian had toward Chu Feng today was completely different. However, this was something that Chu Feng expected. After all, she had come to know what Chu Feng had done on the Immortal Island.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng pays his respects to senior,&rdquo; Regardless of what intentions she had in helping him, it remained that she had helped him. Thus, Chu Feng could not neglect his courtesies.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, you do not have to be this courteous. You can just address me as Aunt Lian like Young Master Ya and Miss Baihe,&rdquo; Nangong Lian said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Aunt Lian,&rdquo; Chu Feng immediately addressed her in that manner. Hearing those words, Nangong Lian&rsquo;s smile became even more brilliant.<br>Due to the fact that there were a lot of people still present, for the sake of chatting in peace, Nangong Lian brought Chu Feng and the others to a relatively quiet location. Then, she said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts have always treated people with indifference. Furthermore, their nature is very cunning and the way they handle matters is very ruthless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Their treatment toward you this time could be said to be especially polite and respectful. I believe that they have an ulterior motive. You must be careful. It&rsquo;s best that you do not go and visit their race as a guest.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
