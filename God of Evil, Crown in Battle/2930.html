        <div> - Illusory Blood Lotus<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; The Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master asked.<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, the Illusory Blood Lotus has appeared,&rdquo; the elder outside the entrance said.<br>&ldquo;Illusory Blood Lotus? Where?&rdquo; The Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall master asked.<br>Chu Feng noticed that the expression of the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had clearly changed upon hearing the name &lsquo;Illusory Blood Lotus.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right outside,&rdquo; that elder said.<br>Hearing those words, the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master hurriedly turned his gaze toward the outside.<br>Seeing this, Chu Feng also cast his gaze outside.<br>Even though a special spirit formation had been embedded onto the palace, making it so that not even Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes could see through the palace from the outside, it was not the case should one want to observe the situation on the outside from inside.<br>To do that, one would only need to use a special observation technique, and one would be able to see through the palace walls.<br>At that moment, with Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes activated, all of the walls seemed to disappear. Chu Feng was able to see the situation outside the Ghost Sect Hall.<br>There was a vast crowd gathered to the northwestern outside the Ghost Sect Hall. People could be seen all over, packing both the sky and the ground.<br>Furthermore, there were currently a lot more people rapidly flying in that direction.<br>The reason why so many people had gathered there was because a lotus flower had appeared in the sky at that location.<br>That lotus flower was not particularly large. Its horizontal width was only about thirty-nine meters.<br>Truth be told, an item of that size appearing in the sky was actually something quite unremarkable.<br>That said, there was a reason why that lotus flower had caught the crowd&rsquo;s attention.<br>That lotus flower was not emitting the slightest amount of light. However, it was bright crimson in color. It was as if it were made of blood.<br>Being shone on by the sun, the lotus flower, surprisingly, appeared somewhat dazzling.<br>At that moment, the lotus flower was still in bud. However, the bud seemed to be moving; it seemed that the lotus flower was soon going to blossom.<br>Judging from the anticipating gazes and excited appearances of the crowd, it seemed like they were waiting for the lotus flower to blossom.<br>&ldquo;It really is the Illusory Blood Lotus. This Illusory Blood Lotus has disappeared for a hundred years, yet it has actually reappeared again now. Furthermore, it has appeared outside our Ghost Sect Hall?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be&hellip; that this really is a coincidence?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had an excited expression on his face.<br>Furthermore, after he finished saying those words, he looked to Chu Feng. His gaze was very profound.<br>&ldquo;Senior, exactly what is this Illusory Blood Lotus?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;The Illusory Blood Lotus is a wondrous object. It first appeared a hundred thousand years ago. Whenever the Illusory Blood Lotus blooms, a treasure would appear at its center,&rdquo; the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said.<br>&ldquo;No wonder the crowd are all looking forward to its blooming so much. So they&rsquo;ve actually come for that treasure,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, they&rsquo;ve all come for the treasure. What is most attention-catching regarding the Illusory Blood Lotus would be finding out exactly what sort of treasure would appear after it blossoms.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, the treasure from the Illusory Blood Lotus is not that easy to obtain. When the Illusory Blood Lotus blooms, it will also release a dense fog.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should one approach it within a certain range, one will be confused by the dense fog. Upon entering that dense fog, one will enter an illusory formation. Only by passing the trial of the illusory formation will one be able to safely approach the lotus flower. Otherwise&hellip; one will either be seriously hurt, or even killed,&rdquo; the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said.<br>&ldquo;This range is a thousand meters from the lotus flower?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng noticed that while everyone was eager to approach the Illusory Blood Lotus, they were all hesitating and maintaining some distance from it. As for that distance, it was precisely a thousand meters.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, a thousand meters is the distance that the dense fog will spread to,&rdquo; the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said.<br>After he finished saying those words, he added, &ldquo;Come, little friend Chu Feng, let us go out and have a look together. Rest assured, with me here, that Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief will not dare to attack you.&rdquo;<br>Afterward, Chu Feng and the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master arrived before the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s City Walls.<br>However, neither the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master or Chu Feng were revealing themselves. Both of them were currently concealed.<br>&ldquo;Look! The Illusory Blood Lotus is about to blossom!&rdquo; someone suddenly shouted.<br>The next moment, the crowd burst into an uproar. At that moment, the Illusory Blood Lotus started to release a faint amount of crimson fog. As the crimson fog was released, the petals of the lotus flower started to unfold.<br>&ldquo;This crimson fog is so strange,&rdquo; Chu Feng started to frown slightly.<br>Chu Feng was able to smell a very intense reek of blood from the crimson fog.<br>&ldquo;According to legend, the Illusory Blood Lotus is called the Illusory Blood Lotus because it is created through refining blood from martial cultivators.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for that crimson fog, it is the blood of martial cultivators. That&rsquo;s the reason why it reeks of blood,&rdquo; the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said.<br>Soon, the Illusory Blood Lotus had bloomed completely.<br>When the Illusory Blood Lotus bloomed completely, the crimson fog also spread out to a radius of a thousand meters. At that moment, the crowd all retreated in fear. They were deeply afraid of being drawn into the crimson fog.<br>That said, as the crimson fog continued to spread out, a crimson dagger appeared at the center of the Illusory Blood Lotus.<br>That was an Immortal Armament.<br>Although its quality could not be considered to be peerless, and it could not be considered a work of art, it was a top quality Immortal Armament.<br>&ldquo;Immortal Armament, it&rsquo;s an Immortal Armament!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd burst into an uproar once again. There were even bold individuals among them that charged directly into the fog.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after those people charged into the crimson fog, their bodies exploded.<br>The treasures that they carried with them were still floating in the crimson fog. However, they themselves had disappeared.<br>Dead. They had died without even an intact corpse remaining, and were assimilated into the crimson fog.<br>However, what was strangest was that the treasures that they&rsquo;d left behind after death were actually floating toward the Illusory Blood Lotus. In the end, those treasures were assimilated by the Illusory Blood Lotus.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that the treasures from the Illusory Blood Lotus are obtained in such a manner?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Reportedly, the treasures from the Illusory Blood Lotus are indeed plundered from others,&rdquo; the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said.<br>&ldquo;That is truly strange,&rdquo; Chu Feng felt with greater certainty that the Illusory Blood Lotus was very dangerous after his guess was confirmed.<br>&ldquo;What is going on?! Why would it be like this?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it said that one would enter an illusory formation upon entering the crimson fog? Why would they die directly?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd were already in utter chaos. Many people were feeling lingering fear and panicking.<br>They had nearly charged into the crimson fog themselves. Fortunately, they did not do so. If they had done so, they would likely have died.<br>At that moment, an aged old man&rsquo;s voice was heard. The tone of his voice was extremely mocking. &ldquo;Fools! Did you all not see the petals of the Illusory Blood Lotus?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How can you all not be aware of such an indication? Yet, you all actually had the nerve to attempt to fight over the treasure?&rdquo;<br>Once the old man said those words, the crowd turned their gazes toward the Illusory Blood Lotus&rsquo;s petals. Chu Feng also did the same.<br>Chu Feng noticed that while the Illusory Blood Lotus was not extremely large, it contained over a thousand petals. The great majority of the petals appeared completely normal. However, one petal was emitting a faint light.<br>That really did make it seem like the Illusory Blood Lotus was giving some sort of indication.<br><br><br></p></div>
