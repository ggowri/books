        <div> - The Power Of Treasures<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon closer inspection, the light was composed of symbols and runes. The complicated symbols and runes had condensed into a suit of armor.<br>Seeing the armor, Chu Feng&rsquo;s brows narrowed.<br>The armor contained a strange power. Even Chu Feng was unable to tell what sort of power that was. However, Chu Feng felt danger from it.<br>Furthermore, it should be worth mentioning that the strange armor of symbols and runes had not only appeared on the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>Instead, such armor had appeared on all eleven of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>Soon, the symbols on the armor started to spin rapidly. With that, they began to shine much brighter. The light emitted by the armor soared straight into the sky.<br>Not even Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power was able to stop it.<br>Eleven pillars of light soared into the sky at the same time and turned into an enormou net filled with symbols and runes that covered the sky.<br>At the same time, a strange aura descended from the sky.<br>&ldquo;This sensation?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart grew tense.<br>When that aura landed on him, Chu Feng felt as if his power was being restricted.<br>His powerful spirit power instantly grew much weaker.<br>However, it seemed like he was the only one who was affected by it. The others present were all unaffected.<br>Upon closer inspection, Chu Feng discovered that a layer of symbols and runes had appeared on his body.<br>The symbols and runes were exactly the same as the ones on the armor worn by the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>Merely, those symbols and runes were extremely small. If Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t use special methods, he would not even have detected them.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was certain that even though the spirit formation of symbols and runes in the sky appeared very imposing and vast, it was only targeting him.<br>This was an ability the Mystic Cave Saints had used solely for him.<br>However, it did not resemble an ordinary spirit formation. Rather, it seemed more like some sort of treasure.<br>At the very least, it was not a spirit formation that the Mystic Cave Saints had set up.<br>&ldquo;How was it? Little brat, you should&rsquo;ve sensed it, no?&rdquo; the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints asked with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This is called the Binding Armor Formation. It is capable of assimilating with one&rsquo;s opponent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For example, since your spirit power surpasses us brothers, the Binding Armor Formation will make your spirit power identical to us brothers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, this Binding Armor Formation was originally prepared for that boy Yuan Shu.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It could be said that we&rsquo;re giving you face by using it on you.&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng finally understood why the Mystic Cave Saints were willing to accept this gamble knowing full well that the Red-dress Holy Land would attempt to request the assistance of Grandmaster Yuan Shu.<br>As it turned out, they were already prepared.<br>According to them, with their Binding Armor Formation, even if Yuan Shu was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he would still be suppressed by the Binding Armor Formation.<br>The Binding Armor Formation would suppress Yuan Shu&rsquo;s spirit power to be at the same level as theirs.<br>It would make Yuan Shu&rsquo;s superiority disappear.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! Those Mystic Cave Saints actually possess such a treasure?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To suppress one&rsquo;s opponent&rsquo;s strength with a treasure because one&rsquo;s own strength is insufficient, this is simply too despicable!&rdquo;<br>The people from the Red-dress Holy Land all lashed out at the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Clamor~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the grand protective formation around the Mystic Cave Saints suddenly shattered.<br>The Mystic Cave Saints all emerged from their previous hideout.<br>They were the ones that had removed the grand protective formation.<br>After Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power was suppressed, they were planning to stop defending, and unleash their attack at him.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after they left their grand protective formation, the giant ferocious beasts Chu Feng had created earlier immediately rushed towards them.<br>Seeing the incoming ferocious beasts, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints unleashed his spirit power.<br>His spirit power turned into flames that revolved around them. Although it was also a defensive formation, it was extremely powerful.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s enormous ferocious beasts were akin to moths flying into the flame.<br>They immediately let out roars and were destroyed upon entering the flames.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s ferocious attack that the Mystic Cave Saints were unable to ward off even when defending with all their might earlier was now easily warded off.<br>Earlier, Chu Feng had held absolute superiority. However, he had now fallen into a complete disadvantage.<br>&ldquo;How could this be? According to them, that so-called Binding Armor Formation will be able to suppress young master Asura&rsquo;s spirit power. However, their spirit power should be identical.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why would young master Asura&rsquo;s spirit power weaken this much, whereas the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; spirit power did not weaken, but has instead strengthened?&rdquo;<br>The Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s elders were all discussing spiritedly.<br>At the moment when the crowd were confused, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the treasure in their hand.&rdquo;<br>Once she said those words, the elders all noticed that the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; Eldest was holding a horsetail whisk in his hand.<br>The horsetail whisk was very small, much smaller than an ordinary horsetail whisk. It also did not appear to be special at all. It was so unremarkable that they&rsquo;d nearly failed to notice it.<br>The spirit power that was suppressing Chu Feng did not come from the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints. Instead, it was coming from that horsetail whisk.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that that horsetail whisk is capable of strengthening your spirit power?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve guessed correctly. This horsetail whisk of mine is something I obtained from an Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant. It is a treasure from the Ancient Era.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is also something we prepared for Yuan Shu.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As you can see, my Binding Armor Formation is capable of suppressing your power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, at the same time, our own spirit power is also suppressed by it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our spirit power is suppressed to a level identical to yours.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Under this sort of circumstance, it would be impossible to determine a victor. At the very most, we&rsquo;d reach a tie.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s different with this horsetail whisk in hand. This horsetail whisk is unaffected by the power of the Binding Armor Formation, and can strengthen my spirit power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With it in hand, you are destined to lose.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brat, do you know now why your daddy was so confident in being able to defeat you?&rdquo;<br>The Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints fiddled with his horsetail whisk. He was extremely pleased with himself.<br></p></div>
