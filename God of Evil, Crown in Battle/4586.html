        <h1>Chapter 4585</h1>
        <div>: A Trap<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Holy Valley&hellip;<br>The clothes that the old man was wearing belonged to that of the HolyValley. He had encountered two of their members, an old man and his young disciple, back at the Whitesky Star River, and the two of them possessed terrifying strength.<br>&ldquo;He has indeed caught my eye, but it&rsquo;s another matter for me to accept him as my disciple. I&rsquo;m just interested in how far he can develop with his talent. Brother Buyu, don&rsquo;t you think that this child will have an interesting future ahead of him?&rdquo; Daoist Niantian asked the elder.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. However, it looks like he&rsquo;s in trouble at the moment after offending the Holy Light Clan. Are you intending to leave him to the lurch?&rdquo; the elder asked Daoist Niantian.<br>Unexpectedly, Daoist Niantian shook his head and replied, &ldquo;His life and death has nothing to do with me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You old fogey. You just said that he has caught your eye, and you are interested to see how far he can develop. Yet, you are saying now that his life and death has nothing to do with you. Aren&rsquo;t you being too heartless here?&rdquo;<br>The elder looked at Daoist Niantian in scorn, but there was no surprise in his eyes. It was just teasing at most.<br>He knew Daoist Niantian well, and it was just like the latter to not lend a helping hand to others.<br>&hellip;<br>When Chu Feng returned back to the Storm Realm, there were still half of the people who came here for the tournament who hadn&rsquo;t left yet. By then, news about Chu Lingxi and Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s capture had already spread like wildfire.<br>Chu Feng had also investigated this matter in secret and verified what Daoist Niantian told him.<br>To his dismay, the Divine Deer wasn&rsquo;t responding to him once again. Left with no choice, he could only take a risk here. He first hid Shengguang Yu up before constructinga killing formation around him.<br>This killing formation was set on countdown, such that it would activate and kill Shengguang Yu once time was up.<br>After that, Chu Feng let out the news that he would be heading to the Storm Combat Dragon Ring in a day&rsquo;s time. The reason for that was to gather more people around and force the Holy Light Clan to fulfill their promise and let Gu Mingyuan and Chu Lingxi go.<br>As soon as he released the news, it caused a huge commotion that shocked everyone.<br>In truth, there was hardly anyone who thought that Chu Feng would really make an appearance. There were those who thought that the Holy Light Clan was being too naive for thinking that they could force Chu Feng to appear just by holding his kin and friends hostage?<br>Who didn&rsquo;t have friends and kin in the world of cultivators?<br>Yet, there were hardly any cultivators who were willing to give up their lives to save their friends and kin.<br>Due to that, even as the news that Chu Feng would appear at the Storm Combat Dragon Ring spread all around, the crowd still held a doubtful attitude toward its authenticity. They felt that there was a chance that it could be fake news.<br>Nevertheless, everyone still headed to the agreed location on the promised date, curious to see if Chu Feng was really going to appear just as he had declared.<br>There were many familiar faces amongst those gathered around the Storm Combat Dragon Ring, be it the Monstrous Herd Temple, the Cloudsky Immortal Sect, or the Yu Heavenly Clan.<br>Only one of the behemoths was conspicuously absent, and that was the Dragon Clan.<br>Naturally, the members of the Holy Light Clan were at the scene too, though their clan chief, Shengguang Xuanye, was nowhere to be seen. Nevertheless, the one leading the members of the Holy Light Clan was still the esteemed Supreme Elder Shengguang Yunyue.<br>There were two people standing by Shengguang Yunyue&rsquo;s side, Gu Mingyuan and Chu Lingix.<br>One thing worthy of note was that neither Gu Mingyuan nor Chu Lingxi was injured, and they weren&rsquo;t even tied up. It could be seen that the Holy Light Clan hadn&rsquo;t hurt them thus far.<br>Nevertheless, their complexions still looked rather awful. They didn&rsquo;t want Chu Feng to sacrifice his own life to save them.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, we&rsquo;re already here. Where are you?&rdquo;<br>When the promised time arrived, Shengguang Yunyue shouted loudly into the surroundings.<br>&ldquo;Let them go.&rdquo;<br>A voice answered in response, and Chu Feng&rsquo;s silhouette came into appearance as well.<br>Weng!<br>A tremendous pressure immediately engulfed the area around the Storm Combat Dragon Ring as soon as Chu Feng appeared, sealing off the surroundings. Needless to say, this was Shengguang Yunyue&rsquo;s doing.<br>Despite so, all she did was to seal off the area. She didn&rsquo;t make a move to harm Chu Feng.<br>The crowd in the surroundings also expressed astonishment at seeing Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng would really come here!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is he on such close ties with those two?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Despite knowing that he would die, he&rsquo;s still willing to put his life at risk to save them?&rdquo;<br>Just the loyalty that Chu Feng was showing to his friends was more than enough to shatter the web of lies that the Holy Light Clan had weaved around him.<br>Of course, it was not that the Holy Light Clan would care about what the others think anyway. They were the overlord of the Holy Light Galaxy, so who would dare oppose them openly?<br>Those who disagreed with their decisions had no choice but to remain silent, unless they wanted to lose their lives.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I didn&rsquo;t think that you would really dare come,&rdquo; Shengguang Yunyue said.<br>Chu Feng looked at Shengguang Yunyue and uttered impassively, &ldquo;Let them go.&rdquo;<br>Surprisingly, Shengguang Yunyue really released Chu Lingxi and Gu Mingyuan, allowing them to leave the area. However, the two of them ran straight to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side instead.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m sorry. It&rsquo;s all my fault. I was afraid of implicating our clan members, so I was thinking of heading elsewhere with them to seek refuge.<br>&ldquo;However, who could have thought that the members of our Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan were too afraid of the Holy Light Clan that one of them actually betrayed us? They revealed our hiding location to the Holy Light Clan!&rdquo;<br>Gu Mingyuan told Chu Feng in self-reproach.<br>On the other hand, Chu Lingxi could hardly stop her tears from flowing. She felt that it would be difficult for Chu Feng to survive this ordeal. How could he stand a chance against the overlord of the Holy Light Galaxy?<br>And this was all because of her&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Elder, it&rsquo;s fine. I was the one who implicated you two.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng told Gu Mingyuan before he turned to face Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Alright, stop crying. I&rsquo;ll be fine. Didn&rsquo;t you say that you&rsquo;re my older sister? What kind of older sister is such a crybaby?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng patted Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s head before glancing in the direction of the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Elder, may I ask you for a favor?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, feel free to speak your mind,&rdquo; the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster replied.<br>&ldquo;I need to trouble you to send them safely out of this place,&rdquo; Chu Feng gestured to Chu Lingxi and Gu Mingyuan as he spoke.<br>The reason why he was saying this was because he was afraid that the Holy Light Clan would renege on their promise and capture them once more. To put it simply, he hoped that the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster could protect the two of them.<br>&ldquo;Leave it to me.&rdquo;<br>The Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster agreed to Chu Feng&rsquo;s request readily, and he quickly got his elders to bring Chu Lingxi and Gu Mingyuan away from the scene.<br>In truth, the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster was an extremely loyal person, and he really wanted to help Chu Feng. However, his actions reflected not only his decision as an individual but the entire Monstrous Herd Temple. If he acted recklessly here, he would only be bringing a calamity to his entire sect.<br>But at the very least, he could at least protect the ones whom Chu Feng held dear.<br>After Chu Lingxi and Gu Mingyuan were taken away by the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster, Chu Feng turned to the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s army and began walking over.<br>It seemed like Shengguang Yunyue wasn&rsquo;t planning to kill Chu Feng on the spot. Instead, she was preparing to take him away with her.<br>&ldquo;Lord Yunyue, how do you intend to deal with Chu Feng?&rdquo; the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster asked.<br>&ldquo;The crimes of killing our clan members and stealing our treasures naturally warrant the death penalty,&rdquo; Shengguang Yunyue replied coldly.<br>She quickly grabbed hold of Chu Feng before leaving the area together with the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s army.<br>After they left, there were a lot of mutterings coming from the crowd who had gathered around the area to spectate the sight.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t easy for such a talented individual to appear in the Holy Light Galaxy, but who could have thought that he was going to meet his end so quickly? Even though they had no ties with Chu Feng, they couldn&rsquo;t help but think that it was a huge regret.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s death would inevitably be a huge loss to the Holy Light Galaxy.<br></p></div>
