        <h1>Chapter 4052</h1>
        <div> - Chu Xuanyuan Back Then<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The complexions of the Wuming Clansmen had turned deathly pale from fear. Even the ones that were not injured hurriedly moved aside.<br>The blue-gowned man&rsquo;s cultivation was simply too powerful.<br>Although they were unable to tell exactly how strong he was, his oppressive might was stronger than that of their Lord Realm Master Wuming Doutian.<br>Faced with such an existence, the Wuming Clansmen naturally did not dare to act rashly.<br>After beating back the Wuming Clan&rsquo;s experts, the blue-gowned man did not attack the Wuming Clansmen.<br>Instead, he began to walk slowly towards Wuming Doutian. After arriving before him, he took out a bottle gourd.<br>He opened the bottle gourd and squeezed open Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s mouth. Then, he began to pour the contents of the gourd into Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s mouth.<br>What emerged from the bottle gourd was not water or wine. Instead, it was bugs, a countless amount densely packed bugs; they poured into Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s mouth nonstop.<br>Seeing thus, the Wuming Clansmen were all terrified.<br>Among them were people that were eager to protect their lord, for example Wuming Fenghuo, who braved the risk of losing his life to walk towards the blue-gowned man to attempt to persuade him to stop.<br>However, right when those people began approaching, Wuming Doutian, who had been unconscious for a while, actually listed his arm.<br>The Wuming Clansmen all understood what his action signified. Wuming Doutian was telling them not to approach.<br>Most importantly, to the Wuming Clansmen&rsquo;s overwhelming delight, their Lord Realm Master, who had originally been so powerless that he couldn't even scream in pain, was actually able to raise his arm. This meant that the state of his injury had improved.<br>Could it be that the bugs from the bottle gourd were capable of saving their Lord Realm Master's life?<br>Their guess was correct. As more bugs continued to enter Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s mouth and body, his aura began to improve. Even though he was still as thin as a dried corpse, even though he was still extremely weak, his aura was growing stronger, and there was no longer any danger to his life.<br>&ldquo;Milord, thank you for coming to our aid.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, please punish us for our offensive behavior earlier.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, all the Wuming Clansmen present knelt and bowed respectfully to the blue-gowned man.<br>They had realized that he had not come to wipe them out. Instead, he was there to save their Lord Realm Master. They realized that he was a friendly force.<br>The blue-gowned man did not even bother to pay attention to the Wuming Clansmen. After putting away his bottle gourd, he stood back up and looked arrogantly at Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;Useless trash, you&rsquo;ve ruled over this Ancestral Martial Starfield for so long and have obtained so many cultivation resources, yet you were defeated by a person of the younger generation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve truly grown more and more useless,&rdquo; the blue-gowned man said in a mocking tone.<br>Once he said those words, the Wuming Clansmen became even more certain that the blue-gowned man was acquainted with their Lord Realm Master.<br>Several Utmost Exalted-level experts amongst the Wuming Clansmen also knew that their Lord Realm Master&rsquo;s three forbidden medicines had not been obtained by him, but instead had been given to him by an unknown expert.<br>Because of that, they suddenly realized that the three forbidden medicines had very possibly been given to their Lord Realm Master by the blue-gowned man.<br>If that were truly the case, it would mean that he was an expert from another starfield.<br>When they thought that up to that point, those Utmost Exalted experts did not even dare to utter another word.<br>They were even more afraid than the other Wuming Clansmen.<br>Due to their special statuses, they knew secrets about their Wuming Clan unknown to ordinary Wuming Clansmen.<br>They&rsquo;d heard from Wuming Doutian that their Wuming Clan was actually supported by experts from another starfield. That&hellip; was their Wuming Clan&rsquo;s backing.<br>Wuming Doutian had not told them exactly who their backing was. He had also told them to keep the matter confidential. They were not allowed to tell anyone, including their fellow Wuming Clansmen.<br>As such, they only knew that their Wuming Clan had a backer, but did not know who it was.<br>However, it seemed that at that moment, they had met that unknown backer, yet, had actually been rude enough to attack him . It was only natural that they grew afraid after finding out.<br>&ldquo;Lord Jianpeng, that is no ordinary person of the younger generation,&rdquo; Wuming Doutian forced himself back up with great difficulty and half-knelt before the blue-gowned man.<br>Even though he was seriously injured and had nearly died earlier, he did not dare to neglect his respect towards the blue-gowned man.<br>&ldquo;I know. That kid is that man&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I suggest you kill that man and wipe out his entire family?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, Lord Longping opposed my suggestion. Furthermore, you useless thing, you actually also suggested keeping him alive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If the two of you had listened to me and had wiped out both him and his clan, what happened today wouldn&rsquo;t have happened,&rdquo; said the blue-gowned man.<br>&ldquo;Lord Jianpeng, if I could&rsquo;ve killed him, this subordinate would&rsquo;ve definitely killed him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, when I fought against Chu Xuanyuan, you and Lord Longping were also present.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the two of you also say that you were able to tell that Chu Xuanyuan was not going all-out in his battle against me?&rdquo; said Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;What are you implying?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you suggestinh that even if I was to take him on, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to kill him?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Just because you were no match for him doesn&rsquo;t mean that I wouldn&rsquo;t have been a match for him either!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Ancestral Martial Starfield has long declined into place of desolation. Who could I not eliminate here?!&rdquo; The blue-gowned man had grown furious.<br>Seeing that he was angered, Wuming Doutian no longer said anything.<br>However, their short conversation allowed the Wuming Clan to learn one thing.<br>It turned out that when Wuming Doutian had fought Chu Xuanyuan, there had been two other experts present.<br>Furthermore, their Lord Realm Master had actually been unable to defeat Chu Xuanyuan.<br>This&hellip; was shocking news.<br>After all, the great majority of the Wuming Clansmen had always thought that the battle between their Lord Realm Master and Chu Xuanyuan had ended in their Lord Realm Master&rsquo;s victory.<br>It was only at that moment that they realized that their Lord Realm Master was&hellip; had been no match for Chu Xuanyuan many years ago.<br>But&hellip; if Chu Xuanyuan was that powerful, why hadn&rsquo;t he directly eliminated their Wuming Clan? Why did he instead imprison himself?<br>Actually, it was not difficult to understand. What Chu Xuanyuan feared was not their Wuming Clan. Instead, it was their Wuming Clan&rsquo;s backing.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that man has died?&rdquo; asked the blue-gowned man all of a sudden.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Milord. Chu Xuanyuan has died. It's very possible that he died after losing control during training,&rdquo; said Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, even though Lord Longping and I were hidden, we still got detected by that man.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He must have been afraid of us. That&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t defeat you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for imprisoning himself in that so-called forbidden area, it must have been for the sake of training. LIkely, he was planning to return to take care of you after he completed his training.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truly a cunning man. Unfortunately, it would appear that even though he was very shrewd, his talent was still limited.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He actually died from losing control mid-training. Laughable indeed.&rdquo;<br>The blue-gowned man was extremely pleased with himself. He did not hide his detest towards Chu Xuanyuan in the slightest.<br>However, Wuming Doutian actually knew that the blue-gowned man had actually heaved a sigh of relief after learning of Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s death.<br>A moment before, he had been shouting about his regret at not killing Chu Xuanyuan, and had pushed all the blame onto him.<br>But, having fought against Chu Xuanyuan then, Wuming Doutian knew very well that he was not the only person who wasn't able to kill Chu Xuanyuan; even the blue-gowned man and the other even more powerful Lord Longping had not possessed certainty at being able to kill Chu Xuanyuan.<br>Because of that, they'd decided to spare him. It was because they knew that Chu Xuanyuan was actually extremely powerful that the Chu Heavenly Clan was able to survive for so long.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that the Wuming Clan did not wish to eliminate the roots. It was simply that they were afraid of Chu Xuanyuan.<br>Everyone believed that Chu Xuanyuan was actually afraid of the Wuming Clan.<br>But, Wuming Doutian knew very well that Chu Xuanyuan had no longer placed their Wuming Clan in his eyes.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t Chu Xuanyuan that was afraid of his Wuming Clan. Rather, it was his Wuming Clan that was afraid of Chu Xuanyuan.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that he had learned of Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s death, Wuming Doutian would not have dared to rashly attack the Chu Heavenly Clan. Even though his overlord status had been seized by the Chu Heavenly Clan, he still did not dare to attack them.<br></p></div>
