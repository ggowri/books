        <div> - Swarming With Experts<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;For those two girls to appear in the vicinity of the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range; this shouldn&rsquo;t be a coincidence, no?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder.<br>&ldquo;That is also what I&rsquo;m thinking. I think that it isn&rsquo;t a coincidence,&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder said.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that information has been leaked. Could it be that those two girls are planning to rob the treasures in the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;It would be the best if that is the case,&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder revealed a ridiculing smile. Then, with great confidence, he said, &ldquo;If they dare to attempt that, they will be walking right into a trap, and will not be able to escape.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that Liangqiu Chengfeng is inside the mountain range right now?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;It is not only Liangqiu Chengfeng. Brother Chu, I might as well tell you straightforwardly. For the sake of opening the hidden treasures of the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range, our clan requested the assistance of many experts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, it is not only Liangqiu Chengfeng and our clan&rsquo;s Lord Clan Chief that are in the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range.<br>&ldquo;The Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Li Ruochu and their Supreme Elder Li Taiyi are also present,&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder said.<br>&ldquo;Li Taiyi?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s expression changed upon hearing that name.<br>The current relationship between the Chu Heavenly Clan and the Li Heavenly Clan was simply akin to fire and water. As for that Li Taiyi, he was famous for being on the pro-war faction of the Li Heavenly Clan.<br>The so-called pro-war faction were people that would not cower, and would instead fully support the starting of a war should there be any conflict.<br>In short, they were tyrannical and arrogant individuals.<br>For someone like Li Tianyi, he would definitely fully support attacking the Chu Heavenly Clan to seize the control of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm in the matter between the Chu Heavenly Clan and their Li Heavenly Clan.<br>Even though the two clans had not truly waged war against one another, and had never announced their desire to wage war against one another, the two clans were actually already enemies.<br>As for that Li Taiyi, he was a formidable opponent from the Li Heavenly Clan.<br>However, soon, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had a change in expression. He seemed to have recalled something. Hurriedly, he asked, &ldquo;Li Ruochu, are you talking about that genius girl?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. She&rsquo;s that genius girl who swept away all of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations back then. That said, she is no longer a person of the younger generation, and has grown into an even more beautiful beauty,&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder smiled so brightly that he was emitting light. It would appear that he thought very highly of that Li Ruochu.<br>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief cast a glance at Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng smiled and nodded to express that he had heard their conversation.<br>Chu Feng remembered the name Li Ruochu.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had mentioned the name Li Ruochu to Chu Feng before.<br>Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s parents had passed away not long after she was born.<br>However, she still had an older sister and an older brother.<br>Her older brother was named Li Ming, and her older sister was Li Ruochu.<br>Li Yue&rsquo;er and Li Ming were brought up by Li Ruochu.<br>However, when Li Yue&rsquo;er was five years old, Li Ruochu suddenly disappeared while she was training in an Upper Realm, leaving no news of her whereabouts.<br>As for Li Ming, he was a rare genius himself, and the number one genius of the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations. Unfortunately, he had died in training.<br>After Li Ruochu&rsquo;s disappearance and Li Ming&rsquo;s passing, Li Yue&rsquo;er lost all of her relatives in the Li Heavenly Clan. Because of that, she left the Li Heavenly Clan and entered the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to train.<br>However, judging by things at present, Li Ruochu had not died, and had already returned to the Li Heavenly Clan.<br>With Li Ruochu in the Li Heavenly Clan, Li Yue&rsquo;er would likely have a much easier time in the Li Heavenly Clan. Chu Feng felt that Li Ruochu&rsquo;s return was a good thing.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, I&rsquo;ve actually already heard about the matter regarding the Upper Realm Gate that connected your Chu Heavenly Clan and the Li Heavenly Clan from Li Taiyi.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s precisely because I know that the relationship between your two clans is different now that I did not mention that Li Taiyi is also present in our Scarlet Province Upper Realm. I hope that brother Chu will not take offense to it,&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder said in an apologetic manner.<br>It could be seen that he was originally planning to conceal the matter. However, as he was no longer able to conceal it, he had decided to tell the truth.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. Although the Upper Realm Gate has opened between our Chu Heavenly Clan and the Li Heavenly Clan, we have yet to have any actual conflicts with one another,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief replied with a faint smile.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great, that&rsquo;s great. Our Wuma Heavenly Clan has good a relationship with both the Li Heavenly Clan and your Chu Heavenly Clan; from the bottom of our hearts, we wish that everyone can remain friendly and not have conflicts,&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder said.<br>&ldquo;The relationship between our Chu Heavenly Clan and your Wuma Heavenly Clan is naturally good. Merely, I&rsquo;ve never heard of your Wuma Heavenly Clan entering a friendly relationship with the Li Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief smiled lightly. That smile of his was very deep and profound.<br>The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s strength was actually on par with the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s.<br>As for the Li Heavenly Clan, as one of the Ten Great Heavenly Clans, they would look down on powers like the Wuma Heavenly Clan and the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Yet, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder actually said that they had a friendship with the Li Heavenly Clan. There must be some sort of shenanigan going on.<br>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s because of Shengjie. That child Shengjie truly doesn&rsquo;t disappoint us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, every year, Exalted Heavenly Fate would always make a prophecy regarding the future of the Ancestral Martial Starfield for the Starfield Master Realm. You know that, no?&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder said.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief nodded. He already knew what the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder was going to tell him. However, seeing the complacent look on that Supreme Elder&rsquo;s face, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief found it difficult to interrupt him. Thus, he allowed him to continue.<br>Sure enough, this Supreme Elder began to mention Exalted Heavenly Fate&rsquo;s prophecy.<br>Exalted Heavenly Fate&rsquo;s prophecies were never mistaken. Thus, once the content of his prophecy was announced, it immediately spread throughout the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>At present, everyone felt that Wuma Shengjie was the exceptional genius that would be able to contend against Linghu Hongfei in the future.<br>That was the reason why the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s status had changed. The powers that had looked down on the Wuma Heavenly Clan all began to dispatch their men to the Scarlet Province Upper Realm to befriend the Wuma Heavenly Clan.<br>After all, should Wuma Shengjie really be able to become like Linghu Hongfei, the Wuma Heavenly Clan would definitely become very powerful under his leadership.<br>Should they attempt to befriend the Wuma Heavenly Clan then, it would be too late. That was the reason why the various powers immediately dispatched their men to befriend the Wuma Heavenly Clan.<br>As for the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Li Taiyi, he had come to the Scarlet Province Upper Realm precisely for that purpose.<br>In fact, it was not only Li Taiyi and Li Ruochu who were present when the news regarding the treasures were announced that day. There were also many experts from other powers present.<br>For the sake of manifesting their good faith in making friends, the Wuma Heavenly Clan invited everyone to open the remnant and obtain the treasures together.<br>Because of that, the Multitude Spirits Mountain Range could be said to be swarming with experts.<br></p></div>
