        <div>: Something Formidable<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Wait a moment. What&rsquo;s this Darknight Sacred River you speak of?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei asked curiously.<br>Chu Lingxi quickly explained the history behind the Darknight Sacred River to Shengguang Baimei and the others. It piqued their interest.<br>Chu Feng was also interested in the Darknight Sacred River, but he was more concerned about the safety of Chu Heavenly Clansmen. Besides, he figured that the Darknight Sacred River probably wouldn&rsquo;t disappear that quickly since it had been around for quite a while now.<br>If it did disappear, he would just curse his own luck.<br>He would rather miss the Darknight Sacred River than miss any clues regarding the Chu Heavenly Clan. So, he decided to split up the group.<br>Chu Lingxi, Shengguang Baimei, and the others would first head to the Darknight Sacred River whereas Chu Feng would visit the place where the Chu Heavenly Clan disappeared and see if he could find any clues.<br>In truth, the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was nothing more than a smaller realm to the current Chu Feng. He could swiftly travel from one place to another. Thus, he didn&rsquo;t think that he would be held back for too long.<br>Shengguang Baimei and the others wanted to follow Chu Feng, but the latter told them that it was a private matter. Thus, they could only go along with Chu Feng&rsquo;s arrangement and visit the Darknight Sacred River.<br>&hellip;<br>Chu Feng quickly made his way toward the place where he met the mysterious man. He searched the area, but he was unable to find any clues at all. It didn&rsquo;t seem like the mysterious man had returned after kidnapping the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>It was frustrating, but there was nothing he could do about it.<br>Thus, he began making his way toward the Darknight Sacred River.<br>&hellip;<br>Meanwhile, Shengguang Baimei and the others arrived at the Darknight Sacred River ahead of Chu Feng.<br>The river had manifested above the clouds this time around. It shimmered with a golden brilliance, looking like a golden ribbon drifting amidst the clouds. Its beauty was further highlighted by the night sky.<br>The group approached the Darknight Sacred River, and its roaring tides swiftly caught their attention. It looked much more imposing up close.<br>The Darknight Sacred River often appeared for very short periods of time, so it took a great deal of luck to encounter it. However, things were different this time around. It had been two months since the manifestation of this Darknight Sacred River.<br>There were many people in the vicinity of the Darknight Sacred River.<br>Some were from powers within the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, such as the Starfall Holy Land, Ghost Sect Hall, and Paradise Valley, but there were also those from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Ancestral Martial Dragon City, Divine Body Royal City, Wuming Clan, Wuma Heavenly Clan, Li Heavenly Clan, Tantai Heavenly Clan, and so on.<br>All of the powerhouses and top prodigies were also present, such as the previous overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Wuming Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief Wuming Doutian, as well as the Wuming Clansmen like Wuming Fenghuo, Wuming Yuanzhi, Wuming Xiongmo&hellip;<br>The Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s City Master Long Daozhi and Long Ning&hellip;<br>The Divine Body Royal City&rsquo;s City Master, Kong Ci, and Kong Tianhui&hellip;<br>The Monstrous Holy City&rsquo;s City Master and Xian Yun&hellip;<br>The Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Li Ruochu, Li Yue&rsquo;er, and Li An&hellip;<br>The Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Tantai Xing&rsquo;er<br>The Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master, the Starfall Eight Immortals, Xia Yun&rsquo;er, and Song Yunfei&hellip;<br>The Dao Imperial Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master Golden Crane True Immortal, his disciple Jian Wuqing, and the plain-clothed old monk&hellip;<br>The Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, Old Man Gui Chou, and Ghosteye Boy&hellip;<br>Paradise Valley&rsquo;s Valley Master and Ren Xiaoyao&hellip;<br>These were people whom Chu Feng had either become friends or enemies with. While there was a huge gap between them now, they were indubitably powerhouses in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>It was due to their appearances that the others from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm could only watch the situation from far away, not daring to come too close to the Darknight Sacred River.<br>Of course, these people were only considered as powerhouses in the Ancestral Martial Starfield or the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>To Shengguang Baimei, Shengguang Buyu, Daoist Niantian, and even the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster, they were no more than small fry. They wouldn&rsquo;t even pay them a second glance, let alone show themselves before them.<br>Their eyes were all focused on the Darknight Sacred River.<br>&ldquo;Niantian, what do you think?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei asked.<br>Even though he was more powerful than Daoist Niantian, he had to concede that his analytical ability wasn&rsquo;t as sharp.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something special about the gold in the river. It can be used to forge weapons, but it&rsquo;s only sufficient for Incomplete Exalted Armaments. It&rsquo;s still lacking for Exalted Armaments,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no point acquiring it then. Didn&rsquo;t they mention that there&rsquo;s a treasure inside the Darknight Sacred River? How is it? Are you able to find anything about the treasure?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei asked.<br>&ldquo;There are visible signs of a treasure, but I can&rsquo;t discern its form. It&rsquo;s weird. It should have been possible to dive into the river and explore its depths, but there&rsquo;s some sort of energy sealing off the river. Lingxi, this isn&rsquo;t how the Darknight Sacred River supposed to be, right?&rdquo; Daoist Niantian asked.<br>&ldquo;Master, this is my first time seeing the Darknight Sacred River too. However, my father and grandfather have told me much about it. According to them, it should be possible to freely enter the Darknight Sacred River. At the very least, there shouldn&rsquo;t be such a restriction,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>There was a momentary pause before she asked, &ldquo;Master, how long do we have to wait before we can enter the river?&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi knew that there must be something special in the Darknight Sacred River for so many powers to gather here together. It was just that they couldn&rsquo;t enter the Darknight Sacred River yet, so they could only bide their time.<br>&ldquo;Wait? Lass, if you keep on waiting, the Darknight Sacred River will disappear before you can enter it!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, why is that so?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked.<br>&ldquo;A layer of energy has sealed off the Darknight Sacred River, and it doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s going to disappear on its own accord. Furthermore, the layer of energy harnesses great power. We might suffer a rebound if we carelessly mess with it,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian explained.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi was shocked to hear that. She didn&rsquo;t think that the energy would be so dangerous.<br>&ldquo;Niantian, you aren&rsquo;t able to see through the energy either?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed to say so,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said with a sigh.<br>He didn&rsquo;t think that a vestige in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm would actually render him helpless.<br>&ldquo;If we work together to decipher it, what are the chances of us suffering a rebound from the energy?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei asked.<br>&ldquo;The chances are high,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian replied.<br>&ldquo;This sure is troublesome,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei spat in annoyance.<br>Shengguang Buyu frowned as well.<br>They thought that they could deal with this vestige with ease, but things were more troublesome than they had expected.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, how do you intend to deal with this?&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu asked.<br>&ldquo;How? Shengguang Buyu, why are you asking such a question? Who are we? We are elders of the Holy Valley! We are the rulers of the Holy Light Galaxy. We would become a laughing stock if a mere vestige from a small Upper Realm actually stops us!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, do you intend to forcefully remove the energy?&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu asked.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s reveal ourselves and show the people here the prowess of our Holy Valley,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said with a smile.<br>As tricky as this matter was, he was still confident about pulling it off.<br>With a wave of his hand, he dispelled their concealment. However, there were so many people present that no one paid any attention to them. However, he wasn&rsquo;t too worried about that.<br>Shengguang Baimei released his aura, and the world immediately trembled under his might. Everyone quickly turned their eyes toward him.<br>&ldquo;What a terrifying aura! Who is that?&rdquo;<br>The first reaction the crowd had toward Shengguang Baimei was fear. None of them recognized Shengguang Baimei, and they had never felt such a terrifying aura before.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Daoist Niantian, Gu Mingyuan, and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Chu Lingxi?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is that really Chu Lingxi?&rdquo;<br>However, the crowd quickly recognized the trio. It astonished them to see that the mother and daughter were acquaintances of this formidable expert.<br></p></div>
