        <h1>Chapter 5184</h1>
        <div>: Xue Ji<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Humongous monster? What kind of humongous monster is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That remains a mystery. No one has seen it before. It&rsquo;s all speculation at this point. Some believe that it&rsquo;s a Monstrous Beast King; others think that it&rsquo;s a monstrous beast. In any case, there&rsquo;s a common consensus that it&rsquo;s something that had existed since the Ancient Era. After all, the history of the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm could be traced back to the Ancient Era,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>&ldquo;Does the Demon Spirit King know something about the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng thought that it didn&rsquo;t make sense for someone as powerful as the Demon Spirit King to reside in an Ordinary Realm unless it contained precious resources or a fortuitous encounter.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. You&rsquo;d have to ask the Demon Spirit King himself,&rdquo; Old Cat replied cheerily.<br>Old Cat had removed its disguise, allowing Chu Feng to see its smiling face.<br>It left Chu Feng with a strong urge to punch Old Cat. He had a strong feeling that the latter was up to no good.<br>&ldquo;Old Cat, did you really sell the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He found it hard to believe that Old Cat had sold the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip from him considering how powerful it was.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I really sold it. I have no reason to lie to you.&rdquo;<br>Old Cat looked a bit nervous upon the mention of the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip. He hadn&rsquo;t forgotten that it wasn&rsquo;t just Xue Ji that he had taken away from Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you should compensate me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Ahahaha&hellip; Of course, it&rsquo;s only right for me to compensate you. It&rsquo;s just that I don&rsquo;t have much on me at the moment. Why don&rsquo;t I give you these as compensation?&rdquo;<br>Old Cat passed a Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng took a look inside the Cosmos Sack and saw numerous treasures inside. There were Exalted Armaments and all sorts of medicinal herbs, some of which he had never seen before. He could tell that these were all fairly valuable.<br>Old Cat had likely prepared these in advance in order to save his disciple.<br>It was just that each person perceived the value of a treasure differently. Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t have much use for these things at the moment, so he didn&rsquo;t see much value in them. Not to mention, the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip was a one-of-a-kind treasure.<br>&ldquo;You must be taking me for a fool. Do you think that these things are enough to make up for the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip?&rdquo; Chu Feng growled with a frown.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, these are nowhere close in value to the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip, but I don&rsquo;t have anything else of value to offer you. Oh right! I took care of Xue Ji and even found a good spouse for her. Why don&rsquo;t we call it quits with that?&rdquo; Old Cat replied with a guilty conscience.<br>&ldquo;Old Cat, are you trying to haggle with me right now? Just to be clear, you&rsquo;ll have to compensate me with a treasure equivalent in value to the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip, and I&rsquo;ll be the one to decide the treasure&rsquo;s worth. As for Xue Ji, I&rsquo;ll personally ask her how she has been faring. Be warned that I won&rsquo;t let you off if I learn that she has suffered any grievances,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He stowed away the Cosmos Sack he had just received from Old Cat and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take this as interest for the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; Haa!&rdquo;<br>Old Cat was frustrated by the situation, but it dared not to utter a word of complaint. The tolerance it was displaying here told Chu Feng that it cared deeply for young master Wolf.<br>After rushing the way, the two of them finally arrived at their destination. They exited the teleportation formation and stepped atop the soil of the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm.<br>Boom!<br>As soon as Chu Feng stepped on the land, the earth suddenly began trembling. The tremors only grew more intense with time, and it didn&rsquo;t take long for countless cracks to appear. Dust rose into the air and covered the entire realm.<br>Realizing that something was amiss, Chu Feng quickly activated Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes and scanned the surroundings, but he was unable to find anything at all. It seemed to have been nothing more than an ordinary earthquake.<br>But that couldn&rsquo;t have been the case. How could an ordinary earthquake possibly shake an entire realm?<br>Fortunately, the tremors soon calmed down.<br>&ldquo;Shit! What&rsquo;s going on? I thought that some treasure is going to pop out, but why did the tremors suddenly stop?&rdquo; Old Cat mumbled.<br>It was also closely observing the situation earlier, but it didn&rsquo;t find anything.<br>&ldquo;Ignore that for now and lead the way,&rdquo; Chu Feng instructed.<br>The two of them set off once more. Not too long into their journey, they noticed an intertwining aura of blue and purple gushing into the sky in the distance.<br>&ldquo;What the hell? Brother Chu Feng, do you see that?&rdquo; Old Cat exclaimed in excitement.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to shout. I see it,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>The aura of blue and purple had started to expand. It was still a distance away from them, but they could already feel something ominous from it.<br>&ldquo;Why does this aura resemble the one emanated by the Demoncoffin Realm? Don&rsquo;t tell me that the Demon Coffin&rsquo;s seal has unraveled?&rdquo; Old Cat murmured excitedly.<br>&ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Afraid? Hell no! Let&rsquo;s go take a look! Brother Chu Feng, risk and rewards come hand-in-hand. Trust me on this. Let&rsquo;s head over to take a quick look!&rdquo;<br>Old Cat was so excited that it started rubbing its paws together.<br>&ldquo;The pillar of aura is quite far away from us even though it&rsquo;s within sight; it&rsquo;ll take some time to get there. Furthermore, the Demon Spirit King is bound to have noticed it by now. There&rsquo;s no way he would turn a blind eye to it. Let&rsquo;s look for Xue Ji first. If you wish to explore the area, I&rsquo;ll accompany you after we meet Xue Ji,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He could also tell that there was more to the intertwining aura of blue and purple than what he saw. It was most likely heralding some sort of incredible fortuitous encounter or cataclysmic disaster.<br>On top of that, there was a good chance that the Demon Spirit King would head over and check things out if he was in the realm as well. This might be an opportunity for them to meet Xue Ji. After all, Old Cat had told him earlier that the Demon Spirit King didn&rsquo;t have any subordinates.<br>&ldquo;Fine, we&rsquo;ll do as you say. You&rsquo;ll know whether I have lied to you or not once we meet Xue Ji,&rdquo; Old Cat reluctantly obliged.<br>Chu Feng had actually remembered the map he had received from Old Cat. He only told Old Cat to lead the way to see if it was going to play any tricks. However, it seemed like Old Cat had been honest with him as it strictly followed the paths indicated on the map.<br>Soon, they arrived in a remote forest.<br>Old Cat walked up to one of the boulders and said, &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, this is the entrance. Once you meet Xue Ji, you&rsquo;ll know that I have been telling you the truth all this while.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming with me. Don&rsquo;t even think about playing any tricks. Remember, it&rsquo;s your disciple who will pay the price of your actions.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was still unable to bring himself to trust Old Cat. The latter was simply too cunning.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; Fine fine fine! I&rsquo;ll accompany you! However, you&rsquo;ll have to conceal me too. My concealment formation isn&rsquo;t on par with yours. Also, if we encounter the Demon Spirit King inside, we have to escape right away,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Chu Feng agreed.<br>Chu Feng used the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak to conceal both of their bodies before stepping through the boulder. Instead of entering another realm, he found himself passing through a barrier that led them somewhere else in the forest.<br>The forest inside the barrier was much more beautiful. There were many majestic buildings intertwining with nature, creating a beautiful scenery reminiscent of paradise.<br>&ldquo;It looks like the Demon Spirit King has a good sense of aesthetics,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked.<br>&ldquo;What sense of aesthetics could the Demon Spirit King possibly have? This place was nothing more than an ordinary forest the last time I was here. The Demon Spirit King would just sleep on the forest floor like a homeless person. I reckon that this is Xue Ji&rsquo;s idea,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng realized that there might be some semblance of truth in Old Cat&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like the Demon Spirit King is around. He probably went to check out the blue-purple aura. Let&rsquo;s hurry up and find Xue Ji,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>His confident voice suggested that he had scanned the vicinity using some kind of means. He quickly led Chu Feng to the entrance of a palace. There was a formation constructed around the palace that even Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes was unable to see through.<br>However, Old Cat seemed to be certain that Xue Ji was in there.<br>Tok tok, tok, tok tok, tok, tok tok tok tok, tok tok,tok&hellip;<br>Old Cat knocked the door so softly that an ordinary mortal wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to hear it. Chu Feng noticed that there was a peculiar rhythm to his tapping, reminiscent of a secret code.<br>Once he was done tapping, Old Cat quickly pulled Chu Feng to the side.<br>The palace doors opened, and over a dozen beautiful ladies stepped out. They looked like fairies in a heavenly palace.<br>&ldquo;They are the maids whom the Demon Spirit King has brought in to serve Xue Ji. Come, let&rsquo;s go in,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>ChuFeng followed it in, not forgetting to close the palace door behind him.<br>Shortly after entering the palace, he saw a beautiful woman dressed in white sitting on a chair. She was flawless in all aspects, be it her face, her figure, or her disposition.<br>Even those beautiful maids who had trailed out earlier looked ordinary in comparison to her.<br>She was none other than Xue Ji.<br>She sat in the center seat in the hall, sipping on a cup of tea. Despite not doing much, her subtle movements exuded the domineering aura of a queen.<br>&ldquo;Old Cat, why don&rsquo;t you show yourself if you&rsquo;re already here?&rdquo; Xue Ji asked without raising her head.<br>Her response showed how little regard she had for Old Cat.<br>Chu Feng released his concealment formation, revealing both Old Cat and him.<br>Upon realizing that there was another person together with Old Cat, Xue Ji immediately raised her head. The moment she saw Chu Feng, her earlier domineering aura vanished without a trace, replaced with a look of shock.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng? Why&hellip; are the two of you together?&rdquo; she muttered in shock.<br></p></div>
