        <h1>Chapter 1380</h1>
        <div> - Surging Fury<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s speed was extremely fast. In merely a moment, he had arrived at the entrance. Upon his arrival, he discovered that the entrance of the Sealing Ancient Village was already packed with people. All of the elder level experts of the Sealing Ancient Village were present here.<br>Not only were they standing uniformly, they had even set up a very powerful defensive formation that sealed off the entrance. Each and every one of them was standing there in focused battle formation as if they were facing a great enemy. Leading them was the Sealing Ancient Village&rsquo;s Old Village Chief Ma.<br>Standing directly opposite Old Village Chief Ma and the others were seven figures. Among them, five were the four Huang siblings and Sun Lei.<br>As for the remaining two, one possessed a neither tall nor skinny stature and a charming and effeminate appearance like that of a pretty boy. His appearance was very young, much like a juvenile. However, Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that the actual age of this pretty boy was close to forty. His actual age was even older than Sun Lei&rsquo;s.<br>Furthermore, hidden underneath his amiable appearance was a deep sense of killing intent and the cultivation of a rank nine Martial King. Needless to say, this person, this youthful pretty boy, was most definitely Sun Lei&rsquo;s big brother, Sun Hao.<br>Other than Sun Hao, there was also an old man. This old man was not very tall, his height was merely around a hundred and sixty centimeters tall [1. 5&rsquo;3&rdquo;], a head shorter than even most women.[2. In Chu Feng&rsquo;s world.] Furthermore, he was as thin and slender as a match.<br>However, although this old man was so small-framed, he had a very fierce and fiend-like appearance. He had a pair of sharp snow-white eyebrows that looked like two sharp swords. His sharp eyebrows were so long that they actually extended a foot out from his face. As for his pair of tiny little eyes, they were filled with cold light. Contained within those two eyes was an explosive power.<br>Just by looking at those eyes, Chu Feng was able to tell that this old man was a true expert. Although there were a lot of people present, it was likely that only Old Village Chief Ma could contend against this old man.<br>As for this old man, he was naturally the notorious grandfather of Sun Lei and Sun Hao, Sun Feiyang.<br>Sun Feiyang&rsquo;s eyes flashed with coldness. In a very tyrannical manner, he said, &ldquo;Old Ma, I won&rsquo;t beat around the bush. I have been keeping watch over your Sealing Ancient Village this entire time. I have seen that brat by the name of Wang Qiang leaving. Yet, I never saw that Chu Feng at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I am certain that Chu Feng is hiding in your Sealing Ancient Village. I will give you an opportunity right now. All of you, step aside immediately so that I can search for that Chu Feng. If you are to deliberately stop me from searching for that Chu Feng, then do not blame me for being impolite,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you said it like that, I won&rsquo;t beat around the bush either. Little friend Chu Feng is truly not in our Sealing Ancient Village. Even though our Sealing Ancient Village receives all visitors as guests, we will still, by no means, allow you to search our Sealing Ancient Village as you wish,&rdquo; Old Village Chief Ma said with firm conviction.<br>&ldquo;Old Ma, in that case, I can only say that you&rsquo;re overestimating yourself.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Sun Feiyang snorted coldly. Immediately afterward, a loud &lsquo;boom&rsquo; that sounded like the explosion of thunder sounded from within him. Immediately following that, a boundlessly frightening oppressive might that carried Emperor level martial power along with it swept forth like a hurricane.<br>&ldquo;Heeeaaahhhh~~~~&rdquo;<br>In response, Old Village Chief Ma also snorted angrily. As he raised his arms up high, his gown began to rapidly flutter. Following that, a powerful oppressive might visible to the naked eye swept forth from within him and blocked Sun Feiyang&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>As they saw the explosion from the collision between the two oppressive mights, the villagers of the Sealing Ancient Village all began to deeply frown as if they were facing a great enemy. They knew that this difficult battle had started.<br>However, right at this time, Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice suddenly sounded, &ldquo;Stop! I, Chu Feng, am here!&rdquo;<br>At the moment when Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice was heard, everyone present became stunned. Especially after they saw Chu Feng, all kinds of different complicated expressions emerged on their faces.<br>For the villagers of the Sealing Ancient Village, they were shocked. They could not understand why Chu Feng would appear at such a time. Could it be that he didn&rsquo;t know how dangerous it would be for him to show himself?<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&hellip;.&rdquo; As for Old Village Chief Ma, he had an expression of anxiety and worry all across his face.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Chu Feng?&rdquo; Sun Feiyang took a glance at Sun Lei, Huang Feng and the others.<br>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; Sun Lei nodded.<br>&ldquo;Old Ma, didn&rsquo;t you say that Chu Feng had left? In that case, why would he appear in this place now? You were deliberately deceiving me! Today, I must obtain an explanation from you!&rdquo; Although Sun Feiyang had removed his oppressive might, he still snarled at Old Village Chief Ma in anger.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing those words, the crowd from the Sealing Ancient Village started to deeply frown. Subconsciously, they turned their gaze to Old Village Chief Ma. At this moment, Old Village Chief Ma was also frowning. He did not know how to respond to Sun Feiyang.<br>At the moment when the crowd from the Sealing Ancient Village was stuck between a rock and a hard place, Chu Feng spoke, &ldquo;I did indeed leave. However, I&rsquo;ve returned,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brat, don&rsquo;t you try to spout lies and nonsense. We have been waiting for you at the entrance of the Sealing Ancient Village the entire time. During that time, we did not see a single trace of you. Tell me, exactly when did you leave?&rdquo; Sun Feiyang asked with a cold voice.<br>&ldquo;There are many entrances and exits in the Sealing Ancient Village, what makes you think that I must leave through the main entrance? Actually, I would instead like to ask what exactly is your intention for not coming to find me in the Sealing Ancient Village, and instead deciding to wait for me outside of the main entrance? Could it be that you all were trying to assassinate me and then steal my property? So it turns out that the World Spiritist Alliance is actually just a bunch of despicable people,&rdquo; Chu Feng said mockingly.<br>&ldquo;What jest! Assassinate you to steal your property? We were merely afraid that you would try to escape. In fact, didn&rsquo;t you escape for real?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Earlier, you spoke such boastful words of taking us on at any time, so why did you instead escape?&rdquo; Sun Lei said.<br>&ldquo;I suddenly thought of an urgent matter. Thus, I decided to leave. However, as I was leaving, I suddenly recalled that I had yet to teach your big brother a lesson. Thus, I came back,&rdquo; As he spoke those words, Chu Feng looked to Sun Lei&rsquo;s big brother Sun Hao. With a beaming smile on his face, he said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re already this old, why still try to deliberately pretend to be youthful? Could it be that your actual appearance is too ugly to be seen?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it is meaningless to have a sharp mouth. Today, I have come for no other purpose than to avenge my younger brother. I will not bother with superfluous words. Today, I plan to fight with you. The winner shall be the king and the loser shall be the thief. Do you dare to accept my challenge?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why would I not? I have returned precisely for you,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with an expression of confidence.<br>&ldquo;Yoh, it seems that you&rsquo;re pretty confident. However, don&rsquo;t be so anxious. Before we compete, I shall present to you a gift so that you will know that you&rsquo;re not as powerful as you believe yourself to be, and that I&rsquo;m not as weak as you believe me to be.&rdquo;<br>Sun Hao smiled a strange smile. After that, he opened his palm, and a sphere that glimmered with golden light appeared in his hand. After that sphere landed onto the ground, it rapidly grew in size. In the end, with a &lsquo;thump,&rsquo; it exploded like a balloon.<br>&ldquo;Putt,&rdquo; after that golden sphere exploded, a person appeared and fell onto the ground.<br>&ldquo;This is&hellip;&rdquo;<br>When Chu Feng saw that person, his expression took a huge change. Not only was the person that had fallen to the ground unconscious, he was also covered with blood from head to toe. However, Chu Feng was still able to recognize this person with a single glance. It was Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Yoh, seems like you still remember him. This stutterer here was pretty skillful. Even my younger brother was no match for him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that you have fought against him and defeated him?&rdquo; Sun Hao said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;There is neither hatred nor grievance between him and you, why would you seriously injure him like that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in rage. Even though he had not known Wang Qiang for long and they could even be said to be rivals, Chu Feng had never had a bad impression of Wang Qiang. In fact, he had even considered Wang Qiang to be a friend.<br>After all, if it wasn&rsquo;t for Wang Qiang, Chu Feng would not have been able to break through to rank six Martial King in such a short period of time.<br>He had originally thought that Wang Qiang had already left. Never did he expect that he had actually been captured by Sun Hao and company, and had been beaten to such a state. As such, how could Chu Feng not be enraged?<br>At this moment, the fury in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart was surging and boiling over, filling up his entire body. He made the resolution to properly teach this Sun Hao a lesson.<br>He was going to avenge Wang Qiang.<br></p></div>
