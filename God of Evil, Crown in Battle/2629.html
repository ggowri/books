        <div> - The Pain From The Backlash<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Actually, things like that all depend on one&rsquo;s own encounters, one&rsquo;s own luck. There is nothing absolute.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Using our clan as an example, there was once a True Immortal-level senior. He possessed limited talent, and was only able to stay at the True Immortal realm for the rest of his life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, he managed to live for fifty thousand years before passing away. Although he used various methods to extend his life expectancy, it remains that being able to live for fifty thousand years is extremely rare.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;On the other hand, there was a senior from our clan that was a peak Martial Immortal. He was only a step away from becoming an Exalted. However, he only managed to live for six thousand years. Without even reaching ten thousand years, he reached the limit of his lifespan and died of old age,&rdquo; The old man said.<br>&ldquo;I heard of this matter before. That senior was a genius with great talent for martial cultivation. He was only a step away from becoming an Exalted. Unfortunately&hellip; his lifespan was too short. Reportedly, he started to age rapidly after reaching five thousand years of age.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back then, for the sake of helping him extend his lifespan, our clan used countless methods to extend his lifespan. However, they were all useless on him. It was truly an enormous pity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for that, our clan would have another Exalted expert,&rdquo; Chu Yue sighed.<br>&ldquo;Thus, something like one&rsquo;s life expectancy should be left to fate. It will not be beneficial to concern oneself too much with it,&rdquo; The old man said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, senior, you are one with a naturally long lifespan then, no?&rdquo; Chu Yue said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you must take good care of your health now. You need to make sure to use methods to increase your lifespan when needed,&rdquo; Compared to Chu Yue&rsquo;s mischievousness, Chu Huai was worried for the old man&rsquo;s health from the bottom of his heart.<br>The two of them both knew that the old man before them possessed an extremely high seniority in the Chu Heavenly Clan. The reason for that was because&hellip; he was someone who had lived for ten thousand years.<br>In other words, the old man was an old monster that had countless years of experience, and had seen through all forms of humanity.<br>&ldquo;Something like one&rsquo;s lifespan should be resigned to fate itself. To forcibly extend one&rsquo;s lifespan would be going against the natural order. One should not do that,&rdquo; The old man sighed and spoke indifferently.<br>&ldquo;Senior truly has a broad vision. I hope that I will also be able to be like you when I reach your age,&rdquo; Chu Yue said.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo; The old man burst into laughter.<br>Although the old man&rsquo;s laughter seemed to be relaxed, worry filled his deep and profound eyes.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this must be the place where that Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was healing his injuries, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How is he? Could it be that his injuries are already healed?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Yue cast her gaze to the place where the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was earlier. The reason for that was because the aura of the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster was still there.<br>&ldquo;They have already healed,&rdquo; The old man said.<br>&ldquo;How did he manage to cure himself? Chu Feng&rsquo;s Demon Armament is extremely strange. Even if that Demon Armament&rsquo;s power disappeared, the injuries left by it should not be that easily cured, no?&rdquo; Chu Huai said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. His injuries didn&rsquo;t seem to be that easily cured,&rdquo; Chu Yue nodded in agreement.<br>The two of them both witnessed the battle between Chu Feng and the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster in secret earlier. Thus, the power of the Evil God Sword was fresh in their memories.<br>No matter what, the two of them were True Immortal-level experts. Furthermore, both of them possessed cultivation above that of the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>Yet, neither of them knew what they could possibly do should they be injured by the Evil God Sword&rsquo;s powers. As such, how did the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster manage to cure himself despite such injuries?<br>&ldquo;It is all because of that Infant Soul Demonic Technique that the Infant Soul Sect was able to exist in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm for so long. That Infant Soul Demonic Technique is extremely strange. Else&hellip; it wouldn&rsquo;t be that difficult to handle. A genius like you, Chu Huai, would not have lost to them either,&rdquo; The old man looked to Chu Huai.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Huai said no more.<br>Even though he felt that the current him was able to easily eliminate the Infant Soul Sect, he knew that back then, when he was still much younger, he was indeed no match for the Infant Soul Sect.<br>It was precisely due to his defeat from back then that the Infant Soul Sect left a deep impression in his heart.<br>&ldquo;But, senior, even if the Infant Soul Sect possesses special abilities, the power of that Demon Armament seems to have already surpassed them&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Yue wanted to ask further questions.<br>Chu Yue had not fought against the Infant Soul Sect. Her strength had already surpassed that of the Infant Soul Sect by the time she arrived.<br>Thus, she looked down on the Infant Soul Sect from the bottom of her heart. Thus, she questioned how the Infant Soul Sect could possibly cure the Demon Armament&rsquo;s injury when even she herself could not.<br>Thus, it was not that she did not believe it after finding out that the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster had managed to cure his injury. Merely, she was unable to accept it.<br>&ldquo;Enough, there&rsquo;s no need to continue lingering on this matter. Let me tell you two some good news.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have actually already asked the clan to bring the two of you back into the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Likely, not long from now, the two of you will be able to return to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. There will not be a need for you two to accompany this old man and suffer here,&rdquo; The old man said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, is what you said for real?&rdquo; Chu Yue was overjoyed upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;Foolish girl, when has this old man ever lied to you?&rdquo; The old man said with a slight smile.<br>&ldquo;This is great! I am finally able to leave this desolate place!&rdquo; At that moment, Chu Yue was beaming with happiness. She was truly overjoyed.<br>&ldquo;Senior, with such a major movement from the Infant Soul Sect, they are most definitely plotting something. This junior wants to know exactly what they plan to do. Might it be possible for me to continue to stay here?&rdquo; Chu Huai asked.<br>&ldquo;Chu Huai, we have come here with the purpose of monitoring our clan&rsquo;s younger generation. Our task was to record how they accomplished their missions in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for what happens in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, it is unrelated to us. Even if there was conflict between you and the Infant Soul Sect, you still cannot cross the line.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Go on and return. From today on, you two do not have to involve yourself with anything in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Just leave everything to me and wait for news from the clan to tell you two to return,&rdquo; The old man said.<br>After hearing what the old man said, although Chu Huai was somewhat unwilling, he found it unsuitable to say anymore.<br>As such, he could only choose to leave. After all, they had to listen to the old man&rsquo;s orders in this place.<br>After Chu Yue and Chu Huai left, the smile on the old man&rsquo;s face instantly disappeared. An ice-cold ruthlessness emerged in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Brats, the two of you had best listen obediently and not ruin this old man&rsquo;s plan. Else&hellip; don&rsquo;t blame me for not taking into consideration the affections of being fellow clansmen.&rdquo;<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>Being assailed by the backlash, Chu Feng soon lost consciousness.<br>After a long time passed, Chu Feng finally managed to regain his consciousness. When he opened his eyes, he was surprised to discover that he was currently in a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood.<br>Chaos filled his entire field of view. Apart from corpses, there was no sign of life.<br>It was as if the entire world had been destroyed.<br>Suddenly, crimson clouds began to roll about in the sky. Two eyes appeared in the rolling crimson clouds.<br>Those eyes were crimson in color. In the sky and within the crimson clouds, they shone brightly like suns.<br>However, the two eyes were emitting an overflowing demonic aura. One would feel fear from the depths of one&rsquo;s soul upon seeing those eyes.<br>Frightening. Those eyes were truly frightening. Even Chu Feng was shivering.<br>It was not that Chu Feng was cowardly. Rather, he was unable to withstand that frightening gaze in the sky. He was simply unable to control his body.<br>His fear originated from the depths of his soul, from the bottom of his heart.<br>Suddenly, the crimson clouds started to descend. That pair of enormous and frightening eyes was also growing closer and closer to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Scram!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng shouted hysterically.<br>He had screamed with all of his body&rsquo;s energy.<br>He had done so because he was afraid. He was scared that that frightening existence was growing too close to him.<br>&ldquo;Boy, you will not be able to escape this Evil God&rsquo;s grasp. One day, you will be controlled by me.&rdquo;<br>An extremely sinister and confident voice sounded from the crimson clouds.<br>That voice seemed to be able to snatch away one&rsquo;s soul. At the moment that voice sounded, Chu Feng felt as if his soul was being controlled by it. He felt as if he would be ripped apart by it. An unbearable pain once again filled his entire body.<br>Too painful. The pain caused Chu Feng to tightly close his eyes and scream nonstop.<br>Just like that, Chu Feng continued to suffer for an unknown amount of days.<br>Then, after days of sufferings, Chu Feng suddenly heard a familiar voice.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Chu Feng&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s voice sounded beside Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>Strangely, after hearing Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s voice, the pain that was tormenting Chu Feng started to fade away.<br>When Chu Feng opened his eyes, he discovered that he was no longer in that mountain of corpses and sea of blood. Instead, he was in a palace hall. That palace hall was not very large, yet it was very exquisite.<br>Chu Feng was currently covered by a grand healing formation. Even the bed that he was lying on was a bed specially made to help one heal.<br>A person was standing outside of the grand formation. That person was calling out his name. She was&hellip; Li Yue&rsquo;er.<br><br>There will not be any chapter counter for this month. I am doing away with it until next month. When everything move in-house, a new counter will be put forth. Weekly chapters is still being determined right now.<br></p></div>
