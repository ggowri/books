        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;re the only one with such means?&rdquo; Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> wasn&rsquo;t intimidated at all.</span><br><span>Cries of agony echoed from his body, but at the same time, he began to emanate a powerful aura. His fighting prowess was growing by leaps and bounds.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Did he hide his clansmen in his body?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t discern the details of Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> and Long Chengyu&rsquo;s battle, but he could tell that Qi </span><span>Weidao&rsquo;s</span><span> fighting prowess had suddenly surged. He could also tell that the cries coming from his body were from the Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clansmen.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That fellow is a smart one,&rdquo; Eggy remarked.</span><br><span>Chu Feng had known that Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> would sacrifice his clansmen to boost his power, which was why he concealed Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span>, Feng </span><span>Jiuyue</span><span>, and Feng </span><span>Tiansheng</span><span>, telling them to bide their time for an opportunity to kill the other Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clansmen.</span><br><span>However, Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> was one step ahead of them.</span><br><span>As if he had guessed Chu Feng&rsquo;s plan, he dispatched a small portion of his clansmen to lure them out. As for the rest, he stored them inside his body so that he could readily sacrifice them to boost his strength. Unless they defeated him, they would have no way to deal with the source of his power.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, I am reaching my limit!&rdquo;</span><br><span>To make things worse, the Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen sustaining the formation were reaching their limits.</span><br><span>They turned to Chu Feng in hopes of a solution, only to see that his body had become emaciated as if someone had siphoned away his energy. Even his hands were trembling nonstop. This was the cost he had to pay for sustaining the formation.</span><br><span>Even though it was the Totem Dragon Clansmen&rsquo;s and Totem Phoenix Clansmen&rsquo;s bloodline power that was being expended for the formation, the one who was channeling this huge bulk of energy was Chu Feng. In other words, he was shouldering the bulk of the burden.</span><br><span>Those who had wanted to say something closed their mouths and persevered with </span><span>gritted teeth. They finally understood why Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t gone with this plan right from the very start. This method took too huge of a toll on him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hurry up, Long Chengyu. Kill that Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> right now!&rdquo; Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> roared.</span><br><span>She had noticed that Chu Feng was in a bad state, and she was worried that his life might be in danger if this continued.</span><br><span>Her shout brought Long Chengyu&rsquo;s attention to Chu Feng&rsquo;s condition. He felt a pang in his conscience, as he knew that Chu Feng was sacrificing himself for their sake. Tremendous killing intent poured forth from him.</span><br><span>He embarked on an aggressive flurry of attacks against Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>, but it was to no avail. The latter was a formidable adversary. In the first place, they wouldn&rsquo;t have come to a stalemate if Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> could be defeated that easily.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha, it looks like Chu Feng is reaching his limit. He must be the one channeling your enhancement formation?&rdquo; Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> asked with a sneer. He glanced at Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ll be in danger at this rate. There&rsquo;s no need for you to go this far for this bunch of people. I admire your guts. If you stop the formation right now and join me, I&rsquo;m willing to call it quits. I&rsquo;ll even consider sparing their wretched lives on your account. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll only die in vain here, and the others will soon follow without your help.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Both the Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen panicked. What Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> said made perfect sense. Chu Feng had no stakes in this matter in the first place, so there was no reason for him to risk his life for their sake.</span><br><span>They were worried that Chu Feng would accept Qi </span><span>Weidao&rsquo;s</span><span> deal.</span><br><span>It was then that Chu Feng opened his eyes and looked at Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>, will you spare us if we back down right now?&rdquo; he spoke with a voice so thin that it showed just how horrible of a state he was in.</span><br><span>Those words further stoked the Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen&rsquo;s panic.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu, Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span>, Long </span><span>Yuhong</span><span>, Long Zhizhi, Feng </span><span>Jiuyue</span><span>, and Feng </span><span>Tiansheng</span><span> fell silent. They respected their decision as they knew that Chu Feng was the reason they could even put up a fight against Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> in the first place. They thought that he had the right to decide whether to continue the fight or give up.</span><br><span>Taking a step back, they didn&rsquo;t have the right to ask Chu Feng to sacrifice himself for their sake.</span><br><span>However, the Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen didn&rsquo;t share the same thought.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> is not trustworthy! We&rsquo;ll all die here if you fall for his lies!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you must put your faith in young master Chengyu. He&rsquo;ll surely be able to defeat Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I know that it has been tough, but Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> must have paid a hefty price to raise his fighting prowess too! Listen, the cries of agony coming from his body have died down from before. Most of his clansmen must be dead by now. He won&rsquo;t be able to sustain that state for long. Just give young master Chengyu some time! He&rsquo;ll surely be able to kill Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Many voices coming from both the Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix </span><span>Clansmen reached Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears. They didn&rsquo;t want Chu Feng to give up, for they knew that it would spell their deaths.</span><br><span>Amidst the uproar, a voice transmission was suddenly relayed to everyone&rsquo;s ears, &ldquo;Everyone, trust me this once. The only way to survive this ordeal is to give up here. Otherwise, we&rsquo;ll lose our lives.&ldquo;</span><br><span>This voice transmission had come from none other than Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Give up? How can we do that? That formation core is&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>The words &lsquo;give up&rsquo; were even harder for the crowd to bear. They could sense the benefits awaiting them inside the formation core, so how could they give up at this juncture?</span><br><span>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> roared.</span><br><span>The crowd immediately quietened down.</span><br><span>Shortly after, Feng </span><span>Jiuyue</span><span> spoke up, &ldquo;Listen well, Totem Phoenix Clansmen. It&rsquo;s all thanks to Chu Feng that we&rsquo;re standing here right now. From now on, we&rsquo;ll unconditionally follow Chu Feng&rsquo;s orders. Anyone who goes against him will be reported to my father and permanently banished from our clan.&rdquo;</span><br><span>No one from the Totem Phoenix Clan dared to say a word anymore.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>A powerful shockwave rippled from the sky, as Long Chengyu hastily retreated from Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Retreat right now, Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>, and we&rsquo;ll evacuate from this place. You can have the formation core all to yourself,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha, there&rsquo;s no need for you to do that. We can enter the formation core together as long as you&rsquo;re willing to make peace. There&rsquo;s no need for us to fight it out like that,&rdquo; Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> said with a smile, but he didn&rsquo;t back away.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Back off right now, Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>, or else I&rsquo;ll stake everything I have into the formation. Even at the expense of my life, I&rsquo;ll aid Brother Chengyu in taking your life,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as murderous intent flowed forth from him.</span><br><span>Qi </span><span>Weidao&rsquo;s</span><span> face stiffened up. He realized that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t joking around with him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Now, now. There&rsquo;s no need for us to go this far, Brother Chu Feng. I have already said that we can share this formation core, so there&rsquo;s no need for anyone to put their lives on the line. If you are unable to trust me, I&rsquo;ll back off, all right?&rdquo; Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> said as he retreated to a distance so far away that it was relatively safe for Chu Feng and the others.</span></p></div>
