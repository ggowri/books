        <div>: Uninvited Guest<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Ah&hellip; This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had no idea how he should respond at all.<br>He was afraid that he would hurt Long Xiaoxiao if he were to refuse publicly. She was the lofty princess of the Dragon Clan after all.<br>But if he didn&rsquo;t reject her, it would only cause a misunderstanding to Long Xiaoxiao and her mother.<br>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been long since Feng&rsquo;er met Princess Xiaoxiao, and there&rsquo;s no deep relationship between the two of them yet. I heard from Feng&rsquo;er that he&rsquo;s deeply grateful to Princess Xiaoxiao for helping him on one occasion, and it&rsquo;s due to that that he came to the Dragon Clan and braved through danger to help Princess Xiaoxiao during her time of need.<br>&ldquo;Given that their relationship isn&rsquo;t that close yet, it might not be appropriate to put them together with one another now,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke up at this moment.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that the one who would help him out of his quandary would actually be his master. After all, from the start to the end, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had been rooting for the two of them to get together.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, I think it would be better to have young master Chu Feng answer this question on his own. What&rsquo;s more important is his opinion on this matter.&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother turned to look at Chu Feng as she said these words. Even though there was still a smile on her lips, her expression looked a little graver than before.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, do you view Xiaoxiao only as a friend? Well, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter that much. As you know, feelings can be cultivated. You can always give it a&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother was still intending to push this matter forward, but she suddenly felt a tug on her arm&mdash;Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Alright, mother. You should quit it with the jokes now. Look at how you&rsquo;ve scared my little benefactor.&rdquo;<br>As Long Xiaoxiao said those words, she flashed a beaming smile toward Chu Feng before continuing on, &ldquo;Little benefactor, you shouldn&rsquo;t take what my mother said to heart. She&rsquo;s just joking with you. You might not know her well since you have just met her, but she likes to pull people&rsquo;s legs.&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s smile was very sweet, such that it was hard not to believe that her mother was really joking.<br>Hearing those words, Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother fell silent. The smile on her face looked much less graceful than before, and the gaze she shot toward Long Xiaoxiao was filled with aching pain.<br>She knew that Long Xiaoxiao had said those words in order not to put Chu Feng in a spot.<br>And in fact, everyone here, be it the Chu Feng, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, and Yu Ting, all knew the truth. They knew that Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother wasn&rsquo;t kidding when she made the earlier proposal.<br>And they also knew that Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s feelings for Chu Feng weren't just at the level between friends.<br>The young lady probably had her heart filled with expectations when her mother posed that question. She was praying fervently with all her heart that Chu Feng would give her the answer she wanted.<br>Even if Chu Feng were to say that he didn&rsquo;t have any feelings for her, as long as he could give her a chance, she would be more than delighted to accept it.<br>Yet, when Long Xiaoxiao realized that her feelings were only putting Chu Feng in a spot, she chose to turn her words into a joke. She had taken Chu Feng&rsquo;s silence as a refusal.<br>Was she not upset about it? Was she not disappointed about Chu Feng&rsquo;s response?<br>Of course she was!<br>She was no ordinary person. From a young age, she had been the lofty princess of the Dragon Clan, a genius whom countless look up to, the goddess in the hearts of the members of the Dragon Clan.<br>Rejection had never been something she had to deal with.<br>Yet, for Chu Feng, she could swallow her indignance silently and even put on a forced smile.<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother felt her heart aching for Long Xiaoxiao. She knew just how much her daughter was hurting on the inside at the moment.<br>&ldquo;What a commotion!&rdquo; a voice suddenly sounded in the garden.<br>Everyone immediately turned their gazes toward where the voice had come from.<br>This was not the voice of anyone that should have been present here. An uninvited guest had made his own way here.<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s gaze immediately turned sharp too.<br>She could tell from the voice that the uninvited guest was someone from the younger generation, but there was no one amongst the younger generation who was authorized to enter this area.<br>Given that someone dared to flout the rules of the Dragon Clan, it was only natural that she would fly into a fury.<br>&ldquo;You are?&rdquo;<br>It was just that upon seeing the face of the uninvited guest, both Long Xiaoxiao and her mother were slightly stunned.<br>The uninvited guest was a man with white skin and wintry eyes. From head to toe, he emanated a conceited air that seemed to say that he was the greatest in the world. Not even Long Xiaoxiao and her mother were worthy of his attention.<br>His dress-up was completely different from that of the Dragon Clan, which meant that he wasn&rsquo;t a clan member at all.<br>But what would someone who wasn&rsquo;t related to the Dragon Clan be doing here?<br>&ldquo;Yu Ting, I never thought that you would be this audacious,&rdquo; the man suddenly turned his gaze toward Yu Ting as he berated.<br>Chu Feng and the others quickly turned their eyes to Yu Ting too, only to see deep fear in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;S-Senior Li!!!&rdquo; Yu Ting exclaimed in fright.<br>Just the word &lsquo;senior&rsquo; that was coming from Yu Ting&rsquo;s mouth was more than enough to tell Chu Feng that this man was no ordinary person.<br>The gaze that he directed toward the man turned a little complicated.<br>He could already guess the other party&rsquo;s identity.<br>&ldquo;You are from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Since you know of our sect, you shouldn&rsquo;t interfere in our business!&rdquo; the man glanced at Chu Feng as he spoke sharply.<br>&ldquo;So what if you&rsquo;re from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect? Yu Ting, there&rsquo;s no need to fear. Tell me what&rsquo;s going on. No matter what happened in the past, you are now a friend of mine. I, Long Xiaoxiao, will redress any grievances you have! Unless he intends to turn the entire Dragon Clan against him, he would do well to keep himself in line!&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao harrumphed coldly as he walked over to Yu Ting&rsquo;s side and wrapped her arm around her.<br>It was clear from her words and gesture that she was going to stand up for Yu Ting here even if she didn&rsquo;t know what was going on at the moment.<br>Nevertheless, she could at least tell that the man was bad news to Yu Ting, or else the latter wouldn&rsquo;t have such a frightful look on her face.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>But after hearing Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s words, that man simply laughed to himself.<br>It was a laugh filled with disdain.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t fazed by Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s threat at all despite being in the Dragon Clan at this very moment.<br>&ldquo;It looks like you really don&rsquo;t know where you are!&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao sneered with fury in her eyes.<br>Her rank six Utmost Exalted level oppressive might also flowedout from her at this moment.<br>&ldquo;I know where this is. You&rsquo;re the one who doesn&rsquo;t know whom you are up against!&rdquo; the man replied.<br>&ldquo;Hidden Dragon Martial Sect might be of equal standing as our Dragon Clan, but you are nothing more than a mere disciple. How dare to mess around here?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao replied coldly.<br>&ldquo;Equal standing? Hahahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the man began laughing loudly to the sky. Sarcasm was dripping from his laughter.<br>&ldquo;What are you laughing about?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao snapped furiously.<br>She channeled her oppressive might all toward the man before her out of rage.<br>However, in the face of Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s hostility, the man simply sneered coldly. In the next moment, a greater force suddenly burst forth from his body.<br>In an instant, everything within the garden was destroyed, and Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s oppressive might was pushed back without any resistance.<br>Rank eight Utmost Exalted level, that was the cultivation of the man before them.<br>His strength was actually far above that of Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao.<br></p></div>
