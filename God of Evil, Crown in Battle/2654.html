        <h1>Chapter 2653</h1>
        <div> - Ginseng King Of Evil<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Tsk, tsk, tsk&hellip;&rdquo;<br>That strange laughter sounded from deep underground and echoed nonstop in the vast sky.<br>Strange and frightening. Hearing that laughter, one would feel one&rsquo;s blood run cold, and feel ill at ease.<br>At that moment, the people in the sky were panicking like ants on a hot plate.<br>They were all afraid that they would be killed by the sealed item, and began to try all means to search for a secret place to hide. There were actually even those who were bold and fearless that directly ran toward the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s old man.<br>Regardless, the great majority of the people present were losing their heads out of fear.<br>Only Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and the others continued to stare at the ground below.<br>No, it was not only Chu Feng and the others. That old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan, Chu Bore, was also doing the same.<br>Chu Bore was looking down with a very serious expression on his face. He even ignored those people from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm who flew towards him to hide behind him.<br>However, compared to the unease that covered Chu Feng and the others&rsquo; faces, Chu Bore had an excited expression.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a golden ray shot out from deep underground.<br>Following that, a figure flew out from deep underground and landed on the surface.<br>Through the surging thick smoke, the crowd was able to clearly see its appearance.<br>At the beginning, the crowd was fearful. After all, they felt that whatever it was that flew out from underground was the sealed item.<br>However, after they saw what it was, the crowd was confused. The reason for that was because the sealed item was completely different from what they had imagined.<br>They had imagined that sealed item to be some incomparably fierce and extremely frightening huge monster.<br>However, what appeared before them was a little three-foot-tall child.<br>That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s appearance was more or less the same as a human child. However, it was clear that it was not a human.<br>The reason for that was because its body was golden, and it was emitting a faint golden light.<br>Even though it possessed a head, a neck and a body, it did not possess any arms or legs.<br>Growing out from its body were tentacles. Those tentacles resembled vines. Yet, they were not vines. The reason for that was because they were clearly comprised of flesh.<br>There were over a dozen such tentacles growing out where its legs should be. They were supporting its body.<br>As for its arms, they were both replaced with a tentacle each. While they resembled arms, there were no hands attached to them.<br>As for its face, it possessed six eyes. However, those eyes were very small. Each eye was roughly the size of half an ordinary human eye.<br>It possessed ordinary-looking ears. Merely, those ears were a little bit pointy. There was no nose to be seen. However, there was an extremely large mouth on its face. Its mouth resembled a hippo&rsquo;s mouth.<br>The insides of its mouth were filled with sharp teeth.<br>The reason why Chu Feng was able to see those teeth was because that child-like thing had its mouth open.<br>It was laughing loudly. It seemed to be laughing because it had managed to escape from being sealed. However, its laughter was very strange.<br>That said, compared to its strange appearance, Chu Feng was sensing its aura. Merely&hellip; he was unable to sense anything.<br>Not to mention being unable to sense its cultivation, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that it was standing right before him, Chu Feng would not even be able to feel its existence.<br>The reason for that was because it simply did not emit any aura at all.<br>&ldquo;It is it! It really is it! I&rsquo;ve succeeded, I&rsquo;ve succeeded! Hahaha!!!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Bore suddenly burst into extremely excited laughter.<br>Hearing that, Chu Feng looked over, and discovered that Chu Bore was holding a scroll in his hand. It was an extremely ancient scroll.<br>&ldquo;That is?&rdquo;<br>Using his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, Chu Feng saw the contents on the scroll. On the scroll was a drawing.<br>What was drawn on the scroll was precisely that thing down below.<br>Apart from the drawing, there were also accompanying words.<br>&lsquo;Ginseng King of Evil. Sealed in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Upon releasing it and allowing it to mature, one will be able to prolong one&rsquo;s lifespan for ten thousand years by eating its flesh.&rsquo;<br>Following those words, the scroll also listed the precise location where the Ginseng King of Evil was sealed, as well as what sort of formation was required to lift the seal.<br>&ldquo;So he unsealed this item to prolong his lifespan?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng not only found out that the name of that frightening existence was the Ginseng King of Evil, but he also found out the intention of that old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng turned his gaze down toward the thing below again.<br>It was only then that he discovered that apart from a human-like head, that thing did resemble ginseng.<br>Merely, its body was much more plump, and its color was much more lustrous than ordinary ginseng.<br>&ldquo;That thing is simply too strange. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s something that old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan can control,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, why do you say that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Look carefully at its eyes. That gaze is so astute and circumspect. It is most definitely not as simple as it appears to be,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>After hearing what Her Lady Queen said, Chu Feng also noticed that even though the Ginseng King of Evil appeared to be very small and weak, it possessed a very frightening, shrewd and ruthless gaze.<br>It was a terrifying existence that had lived for countless years. Likely, it was already over several tens of thousands of years old.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, that Ginseng King of Evil suddenly moved. It disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after the Ginseng King of Evil disappeared, Chu Feng suddenly moved too.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was greatly startled. He discovered that it was not only him that was rapidly moving in midair; everyone else was also rapidly moving in midair just like him.<br>It was that old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan. That old man had used his power to move all the people that were present and still alive. He was bringing Chu Feng and the others together with him using his power.<br>&ldquo;Is he chasing that thing?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng looked down. He seemed to understand why that old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan was doing this.<br>Due to the fact that the speed at which they were traveling was too fast, Chu Feng found it very difficult to see the surrounding scenery.<br>However, when he looked down, he was able to see a figure. It was the Ginseng King of Evil.<br>That thing&rsquo;s dozen-plus tentacles were moving about on the ground nonstop. It was running rapidly. Its speed was extremely fast.<br>It turned out that it had not disappeared into thin air. Rather, it had fled by running. It was merely because its speed was too fast that Chu Feng thought it had disappeared.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan bringing them along while chasing after the Ginseng King of Evil, then Chu Feng would definitely not be able to chase after the Ginseng King of Evil with his current speed.<br>In fact, he wouldn&rsquo;t even know where the Ginseng King of Evil had run off to.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng gasped in admiration at the difference in strength between him and that old man from the Chu Heavenly Clan, as well as that Ginseng King of Evil.<br>As matters stood, the enemies Chu Feng was facing had already greatly surpassed his own capabilities.<br>They were beings that he could not possibly contend against.<br>&ldquo;Interesting.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the voice of the Evil God Sword entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears again.<br>Merely, there was no trace of surprise in its voice. Instead&hellip; there was actually a trace of joy.<br>&ldquo;Did you discover something?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see it?&rdquo; The Evil God Sword asked.<br>&ldquo;See what?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s understandable. With your strength, it would be impossible for you to see it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Well, that doesn&rsquo;t matter. This Evil God can help you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after the Evil God Sword said those words, Chu Feng felt a slight burning sensation in his eyes. Involuntarily, he closed them.<br>&ldquo;That is?&rdquo;<br>When Chu Feng opened his eyes again, he was startled.<br>At that moment, what Chu Feng could see had changed.<br>Originally, due to the fact that they were traveling too quickly, Chu Feng was unable to see anything apart from the running Ginseng King of Evil.<br>However, at that moment, Chu Feng was able to clearly see everything. He was able to see what was happening while they were rapidly moving,<br>&ldquo;This guy!&rdquo;<br>After clearly seeing what was happening, the unease in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart grew even stronger.<br>At that moment, he realized for the first time how frightening that Ginseng King of Evil was.<br><br></p></div>
