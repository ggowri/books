        <h1>Chapter 5230</h1>
        <div>: The Hidden Master and Servant<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing here. Young master Chu Feng, feel free to look around if you wish to. If you do find anything, it only shows that my eyes are failing me,&rdquo; Bitter Remembrance replied with a confident smile, seemingly certain that Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t be able to find anything.<br>He then headed off to find Yue Ling in order to discuss the matter of her new house.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng began carefully examining the mountain valley. He was certain that some kind of secret was hidden inside the valley.<br>To be fair, the mountain valley was considered large to ordinary mortals, though Chu Feng was able to finish combing through the mountain valley within just a few moments. His search eventually led him to the foot of the mountain valley, where an unusual stone was embedded into the cavern wall.<br>Chu Feng placed his hand on the stone and found that he was unable to move or break it despite the absence of formations protecting it.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that surprising since the cavern walls inside the secret realm were nigh indestructible, or else Bitter Remembrance wouldn&rsquo;t have been so confident about their safety.<br>What was peculiar about this stone was that while it appeared to be a part of the cavern wall at first glance, Chu Feng could tell through Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes that it was embedded into it.<br>Unfortunately, that was all he could tell with the limitations of his skills.<br>He had already combed through the valley several times by now, but this was the only anomaly he had found. If there was nothing special about this stone too, it would mean that his guess was completely off the mark.<br>Thus, he began carefully examining the stone.<br>What he didn&rsquo;t know was that while he was examining the stone, a pair of eyes were staring at him from the other end of the stone.<br>It turned out that there was a passageway on the other side of the stone. In contrast to the scenery on Chu Feng&rsquo;s side, the passageway was filled with mysterious glowing plants.<br>Standing amidst these glowing plants was a woman, who stared straight at Chu Feng through the stone with her arms akimbo. Her appearance was above average, though it didn&rsquo;t exactly stand out. She had soulful black eyes and chubby cheeks. She was pouting in dissatisfaction, though it looked rather adorable with her appearance.<br>From her point of view, the stone was a transparent wall that allowed her to clearly see what was happening on the other side. She had noticed Chu Feng and the others from the moment they entered the valley.<br>&ldquo;Ling&rsquo;er, what are you looking at?&rdquo; a soothing and euphonious feminine voice echoed from the other end of the valley.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo;<br>The woman&rsquo;s figure blurred before abruptly appearing at the other end of the passageway. Her movements were so fast that Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to clearly perceive it even if he could see through the stone.<br>Ling&rsquo;er stepped out of the passageway and entered a second cavern that was worthy of being dubbed as a heavenly realm in the mortal world.<br>Above her was a vast starry sky reflecting the world of cultivation. It was possible to make out the nine galaxies at a quick glance.<br>There was a waterfall that mysteriously fell from the sky but vanished into the depths of the ground. White palaces freely drifted in the sky like clouds, but they never collided with each other.<br>There were also many spirit beasts around, from an immortal crane that spanned over ten thousand meters to an emerald swan dancing in the dark sky. Their euphonious calls every now and then were a treat to the years.<br>Be it the palaces, spirit beasts, or greenery, everything inside this space emanated the aura of the Ancient Era except for Ling&rsquo;er and the other woman who had spoken earlier.<br>The woman who had spoken earlier had clear eyes, black hair, and an oval face. There was not a hint of make-up on her, but her beauty was still enough to charm men. She was dressed in a graceful green dress.<br>She had a gentle and graceful disposition reminiscent of someone from a lineage of scholars. The way she carried herself showed that she was a cultured and well-mannered person.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, Old Man Bitter Remembrance is too much! You really shouldn&rsquo;t have told him the way to enter this place back then! Look! Not only did he make a mess of the valley outside, but he also brought outsiders here too. It looks like they are planning to stay here for a long time.<br>&ldquo;That young man called Chu Feng or something is the worst of the group! He&rsquo;s snooping around our entrance like a thief of some sort!&rdquo; Ling&rsquo;er grumbled angrily.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. They can&rsquo;t get in here anyway. Master Bitter Remembrance doesn&rsquo;t know that we are staying here too, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t have dared to reside here.<br>&ldquo;I told him about this location as a way to express my gratitude to him for saving my life. My intention was for him to seek refuge here if he ever finds himself in trouble. The fact that he brought someone else in here likely means that he&rsquo;s in a difficult position. Why would I blame him for doing something I intended him to?&rdquo; the woman replied with a gentle voice.<br>It was rare to meet someone as cultured as her in the world of cultivation.<br>&ldquo;But this is the place where you&rsquo;re staying, young miss! Don&rsquo;t you find it uncomfortable how there&rsquo;s suddenly a group of people here as well? Not to mention, that lad clearly harbors evil intentions! Young miss, why don&rsquo;t we find another place to live in after you finish refining Dragon Blood here? We have plenty of residences anyway. There&rsquo;s no need for us to stay here. Besides, you clearly prefer the residence over in the Seven Realms Galaxy,&rdquo; Ling&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll decide on that later. Is the Dragon Blood awakened yet?&rdquo; the woman asked.<br>&ldquo;Young miss, I have it all prepared. If you wish to, I can awaken it now,&rdquo; Ling&rsquo;er said.<br>She quickly proceeded into the depths of the second cavern before she finally stopped in front of a massive golden lake. The lake was as vast as the ocean, but its surface was calm.<br>She took out a jade bottle, uncorked it, and poured a droplet of blood-red fluid into it.<br>Whoosh!<br>The calm lake immediately began raging as steam billowed from its depths. A dragon&rsquo;s roar could be vaguely heard as a unique surge of energy slowly began to surface.<br>There were massive carcasses lying at the bottom of the lake that would astonish anyone who gazed upon them. They were the whole carcasses of dragons&hellip; and there were more than ten thousand of them!<br>The woman took off her clothes and stepped into the raging lake.<br>&ldquo;Ling&rsquo;er, there isn&rsquo;t enough energy here. Go and refine more Dragon Awakening Potion,&rdquo; the woman said.<br>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t enough ingredients anymore, young miss. I&rsquo;d have to head outside for that,&rdquo; Ling&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; the woman replied before closing her eyes. However, her eyes soon opened once more as she asked, &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you leaving?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young miss, what if that lad barges in here while you&rsquo;re focused on your cultivation?&rdquo; Ling&rsquo;er asked worriedly.<br>The woman burst into laughter. Even her laugh was gentle.<br>&ldquo;The stone sealing the entrance was left behind by Lord Qin Jiu. How could he possibly breach it? You don&rsquo;t have to worry about that. Also, I forbid you from making a move on them. You can&rsquo;t bind, hurt, or threaten them, do you understand?&rdquo; the woman strictly ordered.<br>&ldquo;Fine. I won&rsquo;t make a move on them. Young miss, I&rsquo;ll be heading out now!&rdquo; Ling&rsquo;er replied before heading outward.<br>By forming a hand seal, she was able to walk right through the stone. She was now standing right in front of Chu Feng, but the latter was unable to see her at all. His eyes were still fixated on the stone.<br>&ldquo;What are you looking at, you brat?&rdquo; Ling&rsquo;er scoffed.<br>She feigned two slaps on him, though she didn&rsquo;t actually strike him. Naturally, her words couldn&rsquo;t be heard by Chu Feng either. She mumbled a few more insults at him before finally rising to the air.<br>While she was passing by Yue Ling, she suddenly halted her movement.<br>&ldquo;This lass also has a &lsquo;Ling&rsquo; in her name. Someone crippled her cultivation, and her face has been disfigured. Someone seems to have healed her face, but it&rsquo;s only on a superficial level. What did this lass do to deserve such a treatment? She doesn&rsquo;t look like a bad person&hellip; How pitiful,&rdquo; Ling&rsquo;er said with sympathy in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Young miss wouldn&rsquo;t blame me for helping her, right?&rdquo; Ling&rsquo;er mumbled under her breath.<br>&ldquo;Yeap, she wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<br>Ling&rsquo;er raised her hand, and a gentle stream of spirit power flowed from her fingertip toward Yue Ling. As gentle as the spirit power was, it was incredibly powerful.<br>It was the spirit power of a True Dragon World Spiritist.<br></div>
