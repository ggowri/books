        <div> - Ox-nosed Old Daoist Showing Off<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;My father is truly pitiful.&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi was still looking at the location of her mother.<br>When Chu Feng looked over, he discovered that Gu Mingyuan had already left. Only Chu Xuanzhengfa was still standing there.<br>However, this time around, Chu Xuanzhengfa did not reveal any look of sadness toward Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s coldness. Instead, a faint smile had appeared on his face.<br>&ldquo;How is he pitiful?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;My mother is completely heartless, yet my father is completely infatuated with her. Is he not pitiful?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Look at him, he&rsquo;s even smiling so foolishly. He is truly pitiful.&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said with a sigh.<br>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;ve seen might not necessarily be the truth. Girl, it would appear that you still don&rsquo;t understand your mother enough.&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng knew why Chu Xuanzhengfa was smiling even though he was once again treated so coldly by Gu Mingyuan.<br>Back then, Chu Feng had witnessed Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s worry for him.<br>Naturally, Chu Xuanzhengfa had also witnessed it.<br>As such, Chu Xuanzhengfa had also discovered what Chu Feng had.<br>It was precisely because Chu Xuanzhengfa knew that Gu Mingyuan had him in her heart that he was smiling so happily.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, I do not know my mother well. The number of times I&rsquo;ve interacted with her are not many.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, no matter what, I should know her better than you, no?&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi looked at Chu Feng in an unaccepting manner.<br>Chu Feng smiled and didn&rsquo;t bother explaining.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was ignoring her, Chu Lingxi turned her gaze to the location where Chu Xuanzhengfa stood again and sighed. &ldquo;If only they could be together normally.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, that day will come sooner or later.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, there&rsquo;s you here. It&rsquo;s impossible for them to not have a relationship with you.&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Mn, I will do my best to make them get together." said Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;You two little kids shouldn&rsquo;t involve yourself in the matters of adults.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng and Chu Lingxi were conversing, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s voice was suddenly heard.<br>Turning to the voice, they discovered that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had walked out with two wine gourds in hands.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist tossed the wine gourds into the air.<br>Then, the two wine gourds landed above the two tubs.<br>&ldquo;Clamor~~~&rdquo;<br>Then, two streams of black liquid began to spill out of the gourds into either tub.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what the heck is that?&rdquo;<br>After the black liquid appeared, Chu Lingxi covered her mouth and nose and began to frown deeply.<br>A stench could be smelled after the black liquid appeared. As for that stench, it was being emitted by the black liquid.<br>That stench was very intense. One would feel disgusted upon simply smelling it.<br>One must know that martial cultivators had a very strong resistance, far superior to ordinary people.<br>However, the black liquid was so stinky that even Chu Feng and Chu Lingxi were unable to tolerate it. From this, one could imagine exactly how stinky the black liquid was.<br>&ldquo;The heck is it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little girl, what are you talking about? This is not &lsquo;what the heck&rsquo;, this is something very good.&rdquo; The Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke with a faint smile. Then, he added, &ldquo;The bloodline power that you two possess was inherited from your parents.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the people that possess Divine Power are people that are chosen by the heavens.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The constitution of their bodies is innately different from you two. Thus&hellip; if you two wish to obtain the power of Divine Bodies, the first thing you must do is to alter the constitution of your body.&rdquo;<br>Only by altering your body will your body be able to fuse with Divine Power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, the first step would be to temper one&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The two of you are to each enter a tub and soak in there. Remember, you must allow the holy water in the tub to infuse into your body. Only then will you be able to successfully temper your body.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The two of you have trained in martial cultivation for many years. This should not be a difficult task for you." said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Holy Water? Senior, that&rsquo;s clearly stinky water.&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said with contempt.<br>&ldquo;Little girl, you are truly slow-witted. How could you judge whether or not the water is holy by its outward appearance?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you do not wish to obtain Divine Power, you can very well not bother tempering your body. If it wasn&rsquo;t for me promising Chu Feng to help you, this old man wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered to help you." The Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke in a slightly displeased manner.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, senior Daoist will not deceive us.&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Okay then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, wasn't serious about what I said, please don&rsquo;t get angry. I&rsquo;ll enter the tub right away.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Lingxi spoke, she leapt forth and entered a tub.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng leapt into the other tub.<br>Upon entering the tub, Chu Feng was able to sense the black liquid entering his body of its own accord. If Chu Feng were to guide it, the black liquid would be able to enter his body even more smoothly. The black liquid began to move throughout Chu Feng&rsquo;s body and temper it.<br>This tempering process was not something that could be completed in a short period of time.<br>Thus, Chu Feng turned to ask the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, &ldquo;Senior, how long will this tempering process take?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Normally, it would take a hundred years for you two to complete the tempering.&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;What? A hundred years? Senior, you must be joking, right?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi was immediately alarmed upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;This old man is not lying. It&rsquo;s a hundred years.&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a hundred years, I will be able to increase my cultivation by many levels training on my own. How could I waste time in a place like this?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi started to panic.<br>It was not only Chu Lingxi, Chu Feng was also slightly panicked.<br>A hundred years was indeed too long.<br>Furthermore, this was only the first step to fusing with Divine Power.<br>If this was the first step, it meant that there were other steps after this.<br>If all the steps were added, how extremely long would it possibly be?<br>Not even Chu Feng was willing to spend so much time just to obtain Divine Power.<br>Thus, Chu Feng asked. &ldquo;Senior, you said that it would take at least a hundred years? Is there any other way to cut down on the time?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boy, you&rsquo;ve asked the right question. Normally, it will indeed take a hundred years. However, this holy water of mine is no ordinary holy water. It is something that I meticulously created. Using this holy water to temper one&rsquo;s body, you&rsquo;ll only need ten years.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whilst the two of you are tempering your bodies, this old man will use a spirit formation to assist in speeding up the process. Thus, if it&rsquo;s for the two of you, you&rsquo;ll only need one year.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, if you two are sufficiently talented and are able to properly draw the holy water into your body, you will be able to cut down on the time. It might even be possible for you two to finish the tempering process in three months.&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Lingxi heaved a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Senior, and you said you&rsquo;re not joking around. You nearly scared me to death earlier."<br>&ldquo;This old man said that it would normally take a hundred years. However, I just so happen to be very amazing. With my help, the process shouldn&rsquo;t take that long.&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist proclaimed proudly.<br></p></div>
