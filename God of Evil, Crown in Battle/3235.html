        <h1>Chapter 3234</h1>
        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Goal<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Everything was done by me, Chu Feng. If you have the ability, then come at me, Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice was suddenly heard from the distant horizon.<br>Hearing that voice, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, Nightmare Spirit Clansmen and Heaven-reaching Beast Clansmen were all startled.<br>As for the Li Heavenly Clansmen, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu, they were completely astonished.<br>The reason for that was because, compared to the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen and the others, Chu Huanyu and the others knew that voice.<br>Wasn&rsquo;t that voice Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice?<br>Turning toward the direction of the voice, a figure was really descending from the sky and rapidly flying toward them.<br>As for that person, he was none other than Chu Feng!!!<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, have you gone mad?! Why did you come here?!&rdquo; Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu were astonished to see Chu Feng. Then, they began to scold him for coming.<br>&ldquo;The brothers of my clan have been captured and brought here. How can I not come?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a slight smile on his face.<br>After Chu Feng&rsquo;s words left his mouth, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu were startled. It must be said that they were moved by Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;Quickly, leave immediately! That man is Linghu Lun, the fifth ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars!&rdquo; Immediately afterward, Chu Haoyan shouted once more. He had shouted using all of the power that he had remaining in him. He was afraid that Chu Feng would not be able to hear his shout.<br>&ldquo;Leave? Today&hellip; none of you will be able to leave,&rdquo; Linghu Lun sneered.<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng is truly quite bold. However, it seems that he does possess some abilities. Look at the Symbol of Light on his forehead. Hell, it actually contains such enormous natural energies. If he&rsquo;s able to refine those natural energies, it would truly be a dreadful thing,&rdquo; Mengyan Wushaung said.<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, he wouldn&rsquo;t have the chance to refine it,&rdquo; as Tongtian Yuanming spoke, he looked to Linghu Lun. He knew that Linghu Lun would definitely not let Chu Feng escape.<br>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be so certain just yet. We still have to look at his performance,&rdquo; Linghu Lun said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? What sort of performance?&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke with a curious tone.<br>&ldquo;Strip naked before us and then kneel on the ground and kowtow to me a hundred times. Then, crawl before me and lick my shoes clean. Do that, and I will consider sparing your two brothers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;ll only be sparing the two of them. As for you, I will not let you get away.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You dared to challenge our Linghu Heavenly Clan. As such, there is only one path for you&hellip; the path of death,&rdquo; Linghu Lun said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? In that case, I will have no other path to go than the path to death today?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct,&rdquo; Linghu Lun said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Ah? What did you say?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Linghu Lun and the people from the three clans were all surprised.<br>&ldquo;I said that you&rsquo;re mistaken. I, Chu Feng, have not come here today to apologize, nor have I come here to seek death,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? You&rsquo;ve made me very curious as to what you&rsquo;ve come here for then,&rdquo; Linghu Lun spoke with a cold smile.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that the Symbols of Light can be plundered from others. Is that correct?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That is indeed the case,&rdquo; Linghu Lun said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. I, Chu Feng, have come here today to plunder your Symbols of Light,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What did you say?!&rdquo; Once Chu Feng&rsquo;s words left his mouth, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed. Not to mention the clansmen of the Linghu Heavenly Clan, even the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Li Anzhi, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu&rsquo;s expressions had changed.<br>They simply did not dare to believe Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. They were all thinking that they&rsquo;d misheard him.<br>&ldquo;I said that I, Chu Feng, have come here today to plunder the Symbols of Light from you all,&rdquo; Chu Feng repeated.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. Good gracious, I didn&rsquo;t mishear it. This guy is actually insane.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Holy hell, you&rsquo;re making me laugh to death here. Where the hell did this Chu Feng gain the courage to utter that sort of boasting claim?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come, come. Your daddy I am standing here. I&rsquo;m waiting for you to come and plunder my Symbol of Light. I wish to see exactly how you&rsquo;re going to do that,&rdquo; after being astonished by Chu Feng, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen all began to roar with laughter.<br>They were truly amused by Chu Feng. They were laughing so hard that tears appeared in their eyes. The reason for that was because they felt what Chu Feng said to be truly laughable.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words were simply akin to an ant telling an elephant that it would lift the elephant up and toss it aside, ruthlessly smashing it to death. That was simply too unrealistic.<br>Faced with the crowd that was laughing and mocking him, a faint smile emerged on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>Then, the smile on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face froze, and a sharp expression emerged in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;This guy?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the expressions of Linghu Lun, Mengyan Wushuang and Tongtian Yuanming all changed.<br>They all noticed the sharpness in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes, and felt that Chu Feng was planning to do something.<br>However, they were too late in their reaction.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a loud explosion was heard. Boundless flames were emitted from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>The flames were surging so violently that they instantly engulfed the crowd. In an instant, with the exception of Linghu Lun, all of the people that were engulfed by the flames lost their strength.<br>Even Mengyan Wushuang and Tongtian Yuanming were kneeling on the ground in pain; unable to move at all.<br>In fact, even a Martial Immortal-level expert like Linghu Lun felt enormous pressure as he was engulfed by the flames.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the situation was bad, Linghu Lun immediately soared into the sky and away from the flames.<br>Once he escaped the flames, he immediately began to form hand seals. Then, martial power, like a torrential rain, began to pour toward Chu Feng in waves.<br>However, to his surprise, his attacks were actually blocked by the flames. Not to mention reaching Chu Feng, his attacks were unable to even enter the flames.<br>&ldquo;This guy, what sort of ability did he use?!&rdquo;<br>Linghu Lun had an astonished expression. He simply did not dare to believe that he, a grand rank one Martial Immortal, was not only forced to a state of retreat by a rank nine Heavenly Immortal, but was even unable to breach the flames emitted by that rank nine Heavenly Immortal.<br></p></div>
