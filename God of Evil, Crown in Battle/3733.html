        <div> - The Same Person<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Earlier, you said that I&rsquo;m not qualified to speak about your brother Zhu?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I might as well tell you this. In terms of being qualified to speak, I should be the most qualified to speak about that brother Zhu of yours.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Liangqiu, am I correct?&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke again. However, when he said those words, Grandmaster Liangqiu and Chu Feng&rsquo;s expressions both changed.<br>The reason for that was because the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s voice had changed. That was no longer the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s voice. Instead, it had become identical to old man Zhu&rsquo;s voice.<br>Furthermore, upon taking a closer look, both Grandmaster Liangqiu and Chu Feng were completely shocked.<br>They discovered that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s appearance had changed. His face had turned to that of old man Zhu's.<br>It was not only his appearance; even his figure and aura had become completely the same as that of old man Zhu's.<br>&ldquo;Ox-nose, what the hell are you doing?!&rdquo;<br>After a short moment of being stunned, Grandmaster Liangqiu became even more furious.<br>He felt that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was pretending to be his good friend, something that was extremely disrespectful toward his friend.<br>&ldquo;Liangqiu, you actually failed to even recognize me? I&rsquo;ve truly wasted my time being acquainted with you for so many years.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t recognize me&hellip; you should recognize this, no?&rdquo;<br>As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke, he took out a writing brush.<br>The writing brush appeared to be very ordinary, even shabby. However, Chu Feng was able to tell that it was a world spiritist treasure.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; why would you have&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Compared to Chu Feng, Grandmaster Liangqiu reacted with a shocked expression.<br>Whilst others might not know that brush, he knew it.<br>That brush was something that he had given to old man Zhu.<br>Although that brush seemed to be very ordinary, it was completely unique!<br>At that moment, Grandmaster Liangqiu took two steps back, and began to size up the person before him.<br>After examining him for a bit, he came to a conclusion that the person before him was none other than his brother Zhu.<br>&ldquo;Brother Zhu, so it was you&hellip; You&rsquo;re actually still alive. You&rsquo;re the one who brought Chu Feng out from the Mirror Core?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, why did you decide to disguise yourself as that Ox-nose and play such a joke with me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You clearly know that the person I hate the most is that Ox-nose.&rdquo;<br>After coming to a realization, Grandmaster Liangqiu thought that old man Zhu had rescued Chu Feng and deliberately disguised himself as the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to trick him.<br>However, to his surprise, old man Zhu let out a chuckle and said, &ldquo;I am indeed your brother Zhu. However, I am also that Ox-nose that you detest the most.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, old man Zhu&rsquo;s appearance changed again. His appearance returned to that of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>He had an extremely gleeful smile on his face. However, that smile appeared rather vulgar. He was smiling mischievously, like a child that had managed to prank someone successfully.<br>&ldquo;Senior, could it be that senior Zhu&hellip; is also you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Smart. Liangqiu, look at how dim-witted you are. You&rsquo;re actually slower than a child," the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said as he glanced at Grandmaster Liangqiu in a very mocking manner.<br>&ldquo;Senior, since you&rsquo;re senior Zhu, why did you want me to enter the Mirror Core?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with great confusion.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, the seventy-nine-day appointment is actually a test that this old man had for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And now, you&rsquo;ve successfully passed that test,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; you&rsquo;re really brother Zhu???&rdquo;<br>Compared to Chu Feng, Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s eyes were filled with disbelief.<br>He was still unable to accept the truth before him.<br>&ldquo;Brother Liangqiu, do you still not understand?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The person who I really am is Ox-nose. As for that so-called brother Zhu, he was nothing more than a disguise of mine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When I told you that I needed to enter the Mirror Core in order to save Chu Feng, that was a lie.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I did not enter the Mirror Core. Instead, I directly entered the Gate of Death and changed my appearance to that of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for young friend Chu Feng, he would no longer be able to sense the terrifying power of the Gate of Death after being there for four hours. It&rsquo;s actually not that I&rsquo;ve helped him. Instead, the sound of the Death Bell will only resonate for four hours.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should one be able to endure the Death Bell for four hours after entering the Gate of Death, the power of the Gate of Death will no longer affect them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the great majority of people will have their souls explode and die within four hours.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, not only did Chu Feng endure four hours of the bell, but he even helped Chu Xuanzhengfa endure for four hours as well.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, it was actually all due to Chu Feng that they were able to survive. It's not because I helped them,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Senior, in that case, when you said that you&rsquo;ve stayed in the Gate of Death for many years, that was also a lie?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be considered to be a lie. All these years, I&rsquo;ve been staying in the Mirror Sea. Merely, I was not staying here as the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. Instead, I was staying here as the person you thought to be senior Zhu," the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Brother Zhu, are you sure you&rsquo;re not joking with me?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>He still had a very complicated and even awkward expression.<br>He deeply detested the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. He had even said malicious things about the Ox-nosed Old Daoist to his brother Zhu.<br>Never had he ever imagined that his brother Zhu was actually the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Most importantly, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and his brother Zhu were simply people of two different worlds.<br>To suddenly discover that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and his brother Zhu were actually the same person, Grandmaster Liangqiu found himself momentarily incapable of accepting the truth.<br>&ldquo;Haha. Brother Liangqiu, don&rsquo;t blame me for deceiving you.&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist patted Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s shoulder and laughed heartily.<br>Although he was joking around, he was laughing in a very vile manner.<br>It seemed like he was taking deep joy in seeing the awkward appearance of Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man needs to calm himself.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu took a deep breath and closed his eyes.<br>After a long while, Grandmaster Liangqiu opened his eyes again and looked at the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;So&hellip; you&rsquo;re really able to help Chu Feng fuse with Divine Power?&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>He was determined in his opinion that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was incapable of helping Chu Feng fuse with Divine Power.<br>The reason why he thought this way was because the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had helped many people before. But, without exception, they had all failed.<br>On top of that, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was a very boastful person, yet he had never accomplished anything that he had boasted about.<br>That was the reason why the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was so infamous, and why even someone as upright as Grandmaster Liangqiu would feel such contempt for him.<br>However, upon finding out that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was actually his brother Zhu, his opinion of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist changed enormously.<br>After all, to his knowledge, his brother Zhu was someone that possessed unfathomable abilities.<br>If the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was truly his brother Zhu, it would mean that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was someone who possessed unfathomable abilities, and was most definitely not as simple as he appeared to be.<br>Because of that, Grandmaster Liangqiu felt that perhaps the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was truly capable of helping Chu Feng fuse with Divine Power.<br>&ldquo;Of course. The reason why those people in the past failed is because their perseverance was insufficient, and their strength was lacking.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is different. He&hellip; will soon be able to fuse with his Divine Power, and become a Divine Body.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Liangqiu, congratulations&hellip; you will become the person to witness Chu Feng becoming a Divine Body," the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said to Grandmaster Liangqiu with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Brother Zhu, you&rsquo;ve truly played an enormous prank on this old man.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, I was wrong. I should address you as Ox-nose, no?&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu finally smiled.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression also changed. A faint amount of excitement and anticipation appeared in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you said that I&rsquo;ll be able to fuse with my Divine Power soon?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br></p></div>
