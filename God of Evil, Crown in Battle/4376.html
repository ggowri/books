        <div>: The Same Trick<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing that voice, the bodies of Ma Chengying and the other disciples immediately tensed up.<br>It was an extremely familiar voice to them, and it was one that they hoped that they would never hear again in their lifetime.<br>And when they turned their heads over, the smiles on their faces froze in place before vanishing to graveness.<br>Deep in their eyes, one could see fear and horror.<br>It was the man whose silhouette was carved deep into their minds, and he was standing in the midst of the air, looking down on them with a bright smile.<br>This man was no other than Chu Feng!<br>The same location and the same place, the person who had nearly killed all of them had appeared again!<br>&ldquo;Senior Li Rui, save us! H-he&rsquo;s here&hellip; He&rsquo;s that Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>Ma Chengying and the others immediately ran behind Li Rui to take cover, and some of them screamed hysterically out of fear.<br>They knew that Chu Feng was out for their blood because of what they had done to him, and the only one who could save them was Li Rui!<br>&ldquo;You sure have some guts. Do you not fear death?&rdquo; Li Rui assessed Chu Feng with a slight hint of interest as he spoke.<br>In contrast to the terrified Ma Chengying and the others, Li Rui didn&rsquo;t seem to be too fearful of Chu Feng. Instead, he appeared to be curious instead.<br>He had learned about what had happened between Chu Feng and the other disciples based on the account of Ma Chengying and the others earlier. If he had been in Chu Feng&rsquo;s position, given that the enemy already knew that he was here, he would have surely fled from this mountain range as quickly as possible.<br>In his view, it was a foolish move on Chu Feng&rsquo;s part to return here.<br>So, Li Rui couldn&rsquo;t help but feel surprised by Chu Feng&rsquo;s actions. At the very least, it seemed like Chu Feng was quite a brave individual.<br>&ldquo;There are many people who will be dying today, but I won&rsquo;t be one of them.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he turned his eyes to Ma Chengying and the others.<br>There was a smile on his face when he spoke, such that one could say that his attitude was amicable even. But when his gaze fell upon Ma Chengying and the others, the latter began trembling in fright as they lowered their heads fearfully, not daring to meet his eyes at all.<br>This was a behavior that came from a deep, instinctive fear toward Chu Feng.<br>This was the first time they had been so afraid of someone in the younger generation that it felt almost as if their souls would leap out of their bodies. However, they couldn&rsquo;t be said to be cowardly either. After all, what they had witnessed previously had convinced them that Chu Feng was no human but a demon.<br>&ldquo;Arrogant.&rdquo;<br>Li Rui sneered coldly as his body suddenly jerked.<br>In an instant, a great wind stirred in the surroundings.<br>An incredibly powerful aura burst forth from Li Rui&rsquo;s body and suffused the surroundings.<br>It was the oppressive might from a rank six Utmost Exalted level cultivator.<br>However, in the face of Li Rui&rsquo;s oppressive might, Chu Feng merely chuckled to himself derisively.<br>&ldquo;They must not have told you how another cultivator of the same cultivation level as you ended dying in my hands,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked lightly.<br>&ldquo;Hmph, how can that trash possibly compare with me! I heard that your prowess with world spiritist techniques is on par with that of rank six Utmost Exalted level cultivators. I&rsquo;m actually quite interested to see how great the fighting prowess of a world spiritist of such caliber is. I hope that you won&rsquo;t let me down, or else I&rsquo;ll be sorely disappointed.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Li Rui&rsquo;s body suddenly warped into a streak of light as he charged in Chu Feng&rsquo;s direction.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t using any martial skills at all. He was using the raw strength of his physical body to throw a punch toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>On the other hand, Chu Feng showed no inclination to run or dodge from Li Rui&rsquo;s attack. He stood on the spot unmovingly as the smile on his lips widened a little.<br>It was a smile of ridicule. He was ridiculing the person before him for attempting something so futile.<br>It was as if he didn&rsquo;t think Li Rui was a threat at all.<br>&ldquo;You arrogant brat!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s attitude only served to further infuriate Li Rui.<br>Thus, he changed his mind and channeled more strength into his punch. Instead of testing out Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength, he was planning to kill Chu Feng with his punch.<br>In the blink of an eye, he had already arrived right before Chu Feng, and a punch overflowing with killing intent burst straight toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>Even though it was a punch from a human, its might was not to be scoffed at.<br>Chu Feng stood on the spot and watched calmly as the punch came closer and closer to him.<br>Dang&mdash;<br>And finally, the punch landed.<br>It was such a powerful attack that the surroundings reverberated with a piercing shrill from the shockwave.<br>However, it was Li Rui who ended up wincing in pain before staggering back in a fluster.<br>When he lowered his glance to look at his fist, he saw that his skin had already been torn apart, revealing his flesh and his fractured bones.<br>As for Chu Feng, he simply stood on the spot with impeccable tidiness. He hadn&rsquo;t even lost a single strand of hair from the earlier encounter.<br>The results of this clash had left Li Rui and everyone else with their mouths agape.<br>Wasn&rsquo;t Li Rui the one who launched the attack earlier? How did Chu Feng get out of it unscathed, and instead, it was Li Rui who ended up getting hurt instead?<br>&ldquo;Is it a world spiritist technique?&rdquo; Li Rui asked lividly.<br>He knew that his earlier attack hadn&rsquo;t struck Chu Feng. Before his blow could land, he was stopped by an invisible force, which he assumed to be Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit technique.<br>It was the rebound from the invisible force that caused his fist to fracture.<br>Instead of answering Li Rui&rsquo;s question, Chu Feng continued to mock him instead, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what is it that stopped your attack? Well, I must say that you don&rsquo;t look any different from the man I have killed earlier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You conceited thing! I shall let you have a taste of my true strength!&rdquo;<br>Enraged by how Chu Feng kept mocking him, a crimson tint appeared on Li Rui&rsquo;s good-looking face.<br>Ting ting ting&mdash;<br>Li Rui flicked his hand across his Cosmos Sack, and a cold glint flickered across the surroundings.<br>It was a silver sword.<br>As soon as it appeared, it emanated an aura that made the sky appear dull in comparison.<br>It was an Incomplete Exalted Armament!<br>With such a weapon in his hand, Li Rui&rsquo;s fighting prowess immediately grew by leaps and bounds.<br>Li Rui quickly formed a few hand seals with one hand, which caused the light emanated by the Incomplete Exalted Armament to glow even brighter. Following that, he slashed the silver sword down forcefully toward Chu Feng.<br>Swoosh swoosh swoosh!<br>In an instant, innumerable sword rays filled the sky as they barraged down on Chu Feng.<br>These were no ordinary sword rays but the effects of a martial skill, a rank four Exalted Taboo Martial Skill!<br>Li Rui was completely unfazed by the failure of his earlier punch because he still had this powerful trump card up his sleeves.<br>This was the strongest mean he had in his possession.<br>The sword rays whizzed across the air and appeared right before Chu Feng in a heartbeat.<br>Peng peng peng peng&mdash;<br>Like fireworks, the sword rays exploded right before they were about to strike Chu Feng.<br>Seeing this sight, Li Rui&rsquo;s face turned incredibly awful. Fear was finally appearing in those conceited eyes of his.<br>He was starting to feel frightened.<br>Even his strongest move, a rank four Exalted Taboo Martial Skill which he had cultivated up to the level of supremacy, was unable to pierce through the formless barrier around Chu Feng.<br>Every single one of his sword rays was blocked without fail.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>Given the current situation, he had no choice but to admit that he had indeed underestimated Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spiritist technique had far surpassed his imagination. He was no match for Chu Feng at all!<br>Seeing that he had been completely outmatched, Li Rui didn&rsquo;t hesitate to turn around and take flight.<br>However, it would appear that Li Rui at least had some conscience. He didn&rsquo;t flee by himself.<br>Instead, with a grand wave of his hand, he used his martial power to take Ma Chengying and the others away with him.<br>Seeing the direction they were escaping toward, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but shake his head as the corners of his lips curled up wryly.<br>They were running in the direction of the main formation.<br>Or to be more exact, they were headed for the valley that could seal one&rsquo;s spirit power.<br>This was the method that Ma Chengying and the others used to turn the tables on him earlier, and clearly, Li Rui was planning to use the same trick against him too.<br></p></div>
