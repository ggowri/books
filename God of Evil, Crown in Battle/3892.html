        <h1>Chapter 3891</h1>
        <div> - Experiencing Backlash<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng had returned to the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb with the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>He had returned the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; treasures to them.<br>This included the treasures that the Mystic Cave Saints had plundered from the All-heaven Sect.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, so you&rsquo;re actually still alive. Furthermore, you&rsquo;ve obtained the spirit formation&rsquo;s power, and in even greater measure than our own.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that brother Asura was correct. We were the ones mistaken.&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints were all extremely excited.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance, they would all have been killed by the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted. Chu Feng had saved them.<br>Thus, they were extremely happy that Chu Feng had decided to take the other gate.<br>If he hadn&rsquo;t done that, he wouldn&rsquo;t have obtained the power of that enormously powerful spirit formation and would not have been able to rescue them.<br>&ldquo;In the end, it&rsquo;s brother Asura that&rsquo;s reliable. The YinYang Guidance Lamps were simply unreliable trash.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, that shouldn&rsquo;t be the case. If the YinYang Guidance Lamps were unreliable, the gate we entered should have been the death gate. We shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to exit it alive, much less obtain the spirit formation&rsquo;s power." someone said while the other Mystic Cave Saints were complaining.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. That does seem to be the case.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;...but brother Asura also came out alive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only did he come out alive, but he even obtained an even greater amount of the spirit formation&rsquo;s power than us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly what is going on here?&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints became even more confused.<br>Confused, they all turned their gazes to Chu Feng.<br>Only Chu Feng could clarify their confusion.<br>&ldquo;The YinYang Guidance Lamps were actually correct. The gate you all entered was the life gate, whereas the one I entered was the death gate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, whilst it was a death gate, it was not a gate of certain death. If one could solve the death gate, one would be able to obtain the true inheritance." said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, in that case, it would mean that you&rsquo;ve obtained the true inheritance?&rdquo; asked the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>Chu Feng smiled, and did not answer the question.<br>He didn&rsquo;t want to burden the Mystic Cave Saints. Thus, he didn&rsquo;t plan to tell them the truth.<br>&ldquo;Wuuu~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng grabbed his chest, and a look of pain filled his face. Then, he sat down powerlessly on the ground, and his body began to twitch violently.<br>The energy armor that had enveloped Chu Feng also began to dissipate.<br>The Mystic Cave Saints were able to clearly witness how ugly Chu Feng&rsquo;s current complexion was.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s sudden change brought great alarm to the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>They immediately arrived before him and began to diagnose his condition. Upon doing so, they discovered that Chu Feng&rsquo;s health was extremely weak, his bones were all shattered, and his veins were all fractured. His condition was akin to someone experiencing a backlash from taking forbidden medicines.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, what&rsquo;s happening to you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you eat something bad? Why did you suddenly become like this?&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints started asking Chu Feng what had happened whilst treating his injuries.<br>&ldquo;That Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted is simply too powerful. I was unable to defeat him with my power alone. Without any choice, I decided to overdraft my power and, with the price of a backlash, suppress him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is why this is happening.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I originally thought that I would be able to kill him. Unfortunately, he escaped." said Chu Feng weakly.<br>&ldquo;Ah? The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted didn&rsquo;t die? I thought he had died.&rdquo;<br>Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, the Mystic Cave Saints were very shocked and pained.<br>They were shocked that the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had been able to escape from Chu Feng&rsquo;s fierce attacks.<br>They were shocked by the abilities of the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>However, compared to their shock, they felt more pained. They felt pained that Chu Feng did not hesitate to harm himself for the sake of saving them.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. It&rsquo;s merely a backlash. It&rsquo;s nothing serious.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The eleven of you are ugly to begin with, so don&rsquo;t make that sort of agrieved look. It&rsquo;s truly&hellip; too ugly." Chu Feng looked to the Mystic Cave Saints with a look of disgust.<br>After all, the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; true appearances were exposed at that moment.<br>&ldquo;You stinky little brat, you actually resent us for being ugly?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re our brother, you&rsquo;re not going to be much better looking than us either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right. Even if we&rsquo;re ugly, we&rsquo;re at least distinguishably ugly. As for you, you simply look beyond plain.&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints were truly shameless. They actually began to insult Chu Feng&rsquo;s looks.<br>Chu Feng did not refute them. After all, he was currently using Asura&rsquo;s appearance, and not his own.<br>Asura&rsquo;s appearance was indeed extremely plain, and possessed no imposing qualities at all.<br>What the Mystic Cave Saints had said was true. Plain was the best description for Asura&rsquo;s looks.<br>Although Chu Feng had ended up losing the power of the spirit formation and had ended up suffering from a backlash after forcibly taking on the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, the Mystic Cave Saints were, no matter what, quite capable.<br>With their help, Chu Feng&rsquo;s condition began to change for the better.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, according to you, you should&rsquo;ve obtained even more powerful inheritances.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly what sort of treasures did you obtain? Tell us about it.&rdquo;<br>After seeing that Chu Feng&rsquo;s condition was kept under control, the Mystic Cave Saints became curious.<br>Before Chu Feng could say anything, an aged voice was heard. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t obtain nearly as many treasures as you all.&rdquo;<br>Following that voice, a figure appeared beside them.<br>&ldquo;Who are you?!&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints were immediately startled by this person who had suddenly appeared.<br>After all, they&rsquo;d just confronted someone as fierce as the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, and were still feeling lingering fear.<br>And suddenly, someone unknown had appeared out of thin air. They would naturally be on guard and afraid.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what brought you here?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the person before him, Chu Feng was also surprised.<br>After all, that person was the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s remnant soul.<br>The Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s remnant soul should be staying in that dusky palace hall. That was the reason why Chu Feng was surprised to see him there.<br>However, upon thinking about it, since the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb belonged to him anyways, it would not be surprising for him to appear there. Chu Feng was the one that was making a fuss about nothing.<br>Although the surprise had disappeared from Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes, the Mystic Cave Saints became extremely curious.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, you know this person?&rdquo; The Mystic Cave Saints asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;He is the Great Monster Slayer Emperor.&rdquo; replied Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Great Monster Slayer Emperor?!&rdquo;<br>Even the Mystic Cave Saints felt deep veneration upon hearing that title.<br>After all, they knew better than Chu Feng what sort of person the Great Monster Slayer Emperor was.<br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to Great Emperor.&rdquo;<br>In the next instant, the Mystic Cave Saints uniformly knelt to the ground.<br>Compared to Chu Feng&rsquo;s bow and clasp of his fist, the Mystic Cave Saints actually knelt directly, and were even on both knees.<br>This was the first time Chu Feng had seen the Mystic Cave Saints showing such respect towards someone.<br>&ldquo;This old man is merely a remnant soul. I cannot accept such a great display of respect.&rdquo;<br>The Great Monster Slayer Emperor let out a faint smile. Then, he waved his arm, and a gentle power directly helped the Mystic Cave Saints back to their feet.<br>&ldquo;We truly never imagined that we&rsquo;d be able to witness the legendary Great Monster Slayer Emperor during our lifetimes. Even if I am to die now, I will not have any regrets.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;According to my knowledge, the Great Monster Slayer Emperor is someone of imperious might. Truly never would I have imagined that the Great Monster Slayer Emperor is even more outstanding than I&rsquo;d imagined.&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints were all praising the Great Monster Slayer Emperor nonstop. Adoration filled their little eyes.<br>However, hearing those words, Chu Feng felt something was amiss.<br>How come they seemed to be boot-licking the Great Monster Slayer Emperor?<br></p></div>
