        <h1>Chapter 4054</h1>
        <div> - Unprecedented Horror<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Milord, why are you acting this way?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that there&rsquo;s someone protecting the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Or did something else happen?&rdquo;<br>Hearing what Lanfu Longping said, a look of alarm filled Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s face. At the same time, he was filled with curiosity.<br>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be said that someone is protecting the Chu Heavenly Clan. Rather, something terrifying has happened,&rdquo; said Lanfu Longping.<br>&ldquo;Something terrifying?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What sort of terrifying thing?&rdquo;<br>Wuming Doutian was unable to contain his curiosity.<br>The reason why he was so curious was because he knew the Blue Talisman Clan&rsquo;s strength.<br>The Blue Talisman Clan came from a galaxy relatively near the Holy Light Galaxy, the Nine Souls Galaxy.<br>It was not only the Ancestral Martial Starfield that had fallen into desolation. Compared to the other galaxies, the Holy Light Galaxy was also a relatively weak existence.<br>The overall strength of the Nine Souls Galaxy far surpassed that of the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>Although the Blue Talisman Clan was not the overlord of the Nine Souls Galaxy, they had a certain amount of status and power within the Nine Souls Galaxy.<br>Due to their special bloodline, the Blue Talisman Clan needed special resources in order to train.<br>Because of that, they&rsquo;d dispatched their people to infiltrate other galaxies and extract those cultivation resources for them.<br>Whilst the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s Starfield Master Realm had the blue ores that the Blue Talisman Clan could use to train, the mine only had inferior quality ores. As such, the Blue Talisman Clan did not attach great importance to the Wuming Clan.<br>To the Blue Talisman Clan, the Wuming Clan was merely one of their many chess pieces, one of their many slaves.<br>Because of that, the Blue Talisman Clan had only dispatched two people to keep in touch with the Wuming Clan -- Lanfu Longping and Lanfu Jianpeng.<br>Although the two of them were elders within the Blue Talisman Clan and acted arrogant and aloof before the Wuming Clan, Wuming Doutian, who had been to the Blue Talisman Clan before, knew very well that both Lanfu Jianpeng and Lanfu Longping were only minor characters within their clan.<br>Whilst they were elders, their statuses were not high.<br>Although Lanfu Jianpeng and Lanfu Longping were only minor characters within the Blue Talisman Clan, they were experts with ruling power in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>From that, one could tell what sort of existence the Blue Talisman Clan was.<br>It was difficult to determine exactly how powerful the Blue Talisman Clan was.<br>However, Wuming Doutian suspected that perhaps, in the entire Holy Light Galaxy, only the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s overlord, the Holy Light Clan, could contend against the Blue Talisman Clan.<br>[1. Holy Light Clan &rarr; Shengguang Clan.<br>Blue Talisman Clan &rarr; Lanfu Clan.<br>I guess the Wuming Clan would be technically the Nameless Clan.]<br>What sort of existence was the Holy Light Clan?<br>They were the overlords of the entire Holy Light Galaxy.<br>From this, one could get a rough idea of exactly how powerful the Blue Talisman Clan was.<br>Yet at that moment, Lanfu Longping actually said that if they were to wipe out the Chu Heavenly Clan, their Blue Talisman Clan might be wiped out too?<br>This truly came as an enormous shock to Wuming Doutian.<br>Exactly what was going on?<br>How could such a small and weak Chu Heavenly Clan threaten such a powerful Blue Talisman Clan?<br>Furthermore, what exactly was the terrifying thing that Lanfu Longping had mentioned?<br>Wuming Doutian was filled with curiosity.<br>&ldquo;Our Blue Talisman Clan has a power we were allied with all this time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our allied power is called the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why our Blue Talisman Clan was able to be allies with the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect for so long is because they are not only like-minded people, but their strength is also on par with our own.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right, you should&rsquo;ve seen people from the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When you went to our clan&rsquo;s mine last time, didn&rsquo;t you coincidentally run across people from the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect staying as guests in our Blue Talisman Clan?&rdquo;<br>Lanfu Longping suddenly looked at Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;This subordinate remembers that incident.&rdquo;<br>Wuming Doutian remembered that day. In fact, he found it to be unforgettable.<br>As the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, it was inevitable that Wuming Doutian would become conceited.<br>However, whenever he went to the Blue Talisman Clan, he would realize that he was only a nobody.<br>He was a nobody, someone with a status so low that he was not even qualified to enter the Blue Talisman Clan.<br>It was as Lanfu Jianpeng had said, he was nothing more than a dog to the Blue Talisman Clan.<br>Because he knew his status very well, Wuming Doutian would always maintain a humble attitude whenever he went to the Blue Talisman Clan.<br>But, even though he was prepared, he still received an enormous shock when he saw the extravagance of the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect that day.<br>On that day, he was fortunate enough to witness several grand individuals from the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect.<br>Even though he was only able to see them from afar like the majority of the people present at that time, he was still thoroughly astonished.<br>At that moment, he had genuinely experienced the disparity between cultivators.<br>At that moment, he realized that he was not a nobody or a dog, but rather an ant.<br>Before true experts, he was simply too weak.<br>&ldquo;Milord, why did you bring up the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect? Could that terrifying thing be related to the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be that the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect had a falling-out with the Blue Talisman Clan due to some sort of dispute over one&rsquo;s interests?&rdquo; asked Wuming Doutian.<br>The Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect was no weaker than the Blue Talisman Clan.<br>If the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect were to wage war against the Blue Talisman Clan, it would indeed be terrifying.<br>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not it&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Lanfu Longping shook his head.<br>Wuming Doutian knew that he had guessed wrong. However, he also grew more curious.<br>&ldquo;The Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect has been wiped out,&rdquo; said Lanfu Longping.<br>&ldquo;Ah? Wiped out?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, you&rsquo;re saying that the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect was wiped out?&rdquo;<br>Wuming Doutian was completely shocked. He simply did not dare to believe his ears.<br>If, in the eyes of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s minor characters, the Wuming Clan were gods that ruled over everything, then, in the eyes of Wuming Doutian, the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect was also an existence possessing godly powers.<br>An existence like that should be able to exist forever. No one should be able to match them.<br>How could such an existence have been wiped out?<br>&ldquo;This is absolutely true.<br>Their sect has been completely destroyed. Not a single person was left alive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The long-established Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect that had been in continued existence since the Ancient Era, the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect with a robust foundation, has disappeared from this world,&rdquo; said Lanfu Longping.<br>&ldquo;They were really wiped out?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly who wiped them out?&rdquo; Wuming Doutian asked hurriedly.<br>Due to his limited strength, he had never met the top experts of either the Holy Light Clan or the Blue Talisman Clan.<br>As such, those several grand individuals from the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect could be said to be the most powerful existences he had seen in his life.<br>Yet, existences as powerful as they had actually been killed? Furthermore, their entire sect had been wiped out?<br>Exactly what sort of existence could do such a thing?<br>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t certain who did it. However, we can be certain that it was definitely not done by anyone from our Nine Souls Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that was because on the day the Bloodline Granting Heavenly Sect was wiped out, many people witnessed two figures emerging from the mountain of corpses and sea of blood.&rdquo;<br>One was a man, and the other was an ape,&rdquo; said Lanfu Longping.<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A man and an ape?!!&rdquo;<br>Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s expression had a huge change upon hearing those words. Such terror rarely appeared on his face. Even when he had been faced with death earlier, he did not show such terror.<br>Soon, his body began to tremble violently.<br>Holding onto his shoulder, Lanfu Longping was able to clearly sense how terrified Wuming Doutian was.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you&rsquo;ve also managed to think of who they might be,&rdquo; Lanfu Longping said as he looked at Wuming Doutian.<br></p></div>
