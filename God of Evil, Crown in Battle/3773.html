        <h1>Chapter 3772</h1>
        <div> - Havoc<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi had a look of determination as she answered Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;Great. This is truly great. My dear daughter, you should&rsquo;ve made this decision long ago.&rdquo;<br>After hearing Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s answer, Gu Mingyuan became even more joyous. She was smiling like a blooming flower. She was so excited that she actually hugged Chu Lingxi, picked her up and spun her around.<br>One must know that Gu Mingyuan was a very composed and even cold individual.<br>From this, one could imagine how astonishing of a thing it was for Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others to see how excited she currently was.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, exactly what did you agree to with your mother?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;Mother, put me down,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said to Gu Mingyuan.<br>Gu Mingyuan actually did as Chu Lingxi said and put her down.<br>After being put down, Chu Lingxi walked over to Chu Xuanzhengfa. She actually had a difficult look on her face.<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Lingxi kneeled on the ground. She then kowtowed to Chu Xuanzhengfa and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, what are you doing?&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief hurriedly stepped forward and helped Chu Lingxi back up.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, I have let down the Chu Heavenly Clan. I am unqualified to be a member of the clan.&rdquo;<br>After being helped up, Chu Lingxi started to tremble. She was weeping so much that her face was completely covered in tears.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, exactly what is going on?&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Lingxi like that, Chu Xuanzhengfa became very worried.<br>In a panic, Chu Xuanzhengfa turned his gaze to Gu Mingyuan. He was seeking an answer from her.<br>Compared to the nervous Chu Xuanzhengfa, Gu Mingyuan was extremely calm.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, just tell it as it is. I believe the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others will be able to understand too," Gu Mingyuan said to Chu Lingxi.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Lingxi began to wipe away her tears and adjust her state of mind.<br>Then, she began to explain things to Chu Xuanzhengfa and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Chu Lingxi had two different bloodline powers -- the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Heavenly Bloodline and the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;s inherited bloodline.<br>For the sake of allowing Chu Lingxi to surpass her in the future, Gu Mingyuan had used a secret technique to seal away her Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;s bloodline power when she was born.<br>In fact, rather than saying sealed, it would be more accurate to say that her bloodline power was being reforged; being refined.<br>The reason why Chu Lingxi was able to grasp two different bloodline powers with great proficiency was due to what Gu Mingyuan had done back then.<br>And now, the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;s bloodline power within Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s body was even stronger than that of Gu Mingyuan's.<br>However, Chu Lingxi was unable to control that bloodline power. She was only able to unleash a very limited portion of its power.<br>In fact, she needed to utilize the power of a treasure in order to increase her cultivation by a level.<br>This was simply an enormous waste of the powerful bloodline power within her.<br>The reason why this was happening was due to the existence of the Heavenly Bloodline.<br>Due to the fact that she was controlling two different sorts of bloodline powers and putting a greater focus on her Heavenly Bloodline, it led to Chu Lingxi being unable to fully unleash the power of her Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;s bloodline, even though it was stronger.<br>Because of that, Gu Mingyuan had proposed to have Chu Lingxi renounce her Heavenly Bloodline.<br>She wanted Chu Lingxi to suppress her Heavenly Bloodline and put all her focus into the cultivation of her Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;s bloodline.<br>With that, Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s cultivation speed would accelerate.<br>However, at the time the proposal was raised, Chu Lingxi refused it.<br>She would rather her cultivation speed be slower than to suppress her Heavenly Bloodline. To Chu Lingxi, she felt that her Heavenly Bloodline was her true bloodline, her roots.<br>However, for the sake of catching up to Chu Feng, Chu Lingxi decided to suppress her Heavenly Bloodline and focus wholly on cultivating her Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;s bloodline.<br>That was why she'd knelt, kowtowed and had cried so hard earlier.<br>&ldquo;Foolish girl, you are only suppressing it temporarily, not sealing it forever. There is no need to react like this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, even if you decided to permanently seal away your Heavenly Bloodline, if you are able to increase your cultivation by doing that, your father will also support you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;re surnamed Chu, you will forever be my daughter, forever be a member of our Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa heaved a sigh of relief upon learning what was going on.<br>To him, this was a trifling matter.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, what your father said is correct. Go ahead and focus on training.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although familial love and friendships are important in this world, you&rsquo;ve also witnessed how dangerous the martial cultivation world is. If you want to be able to live your life peacefully in this world, you must have a strong cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, increasing your cultivation quickly is more important than anything else.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for bloodline powers, they are trivial matters,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief smiled and comforted Chu Lingxi as well.<br>Hearing those words from her father and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the burden was lifted from Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s heart.<br>&ldquo;Mother, in that case, when shall we set off?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi looked to Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;When do you want to set off?&rdquo; asked Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;Right away,&rdquo; said Chu Lingxi.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Even if two starfields were adjacent to one another, there was still a considerable amount of distance between them.<br>Traveling from the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm to the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s Reincarnation Upper Realm was destined to be a long journey.<br>Even though Chu Feng had Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s treasure, it still took him over a dozen days to arrive at the Reincarnation Upper Realm.<br>At the moment Chu Feng stepped out of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Teleportation Formation, what appeared before him was a world in another starfield.<br>That place was the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s Reincarnation Upper Realm.<br>&ldquo;This feeling, it&rsquo;s truly been a long time.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had a look of excitement on his face. It was an excitement that he had not had for a long time.<br>Everything there was new to him. The flowers, plants, trees and even the air felt fresh and unfamiliar.<br>Arriving in an unfamiliar land would always be a journey filled with unknowns.<br>Everything was so very unfamiliar, and waiting for Chu Feng to explore.<br>Chu Feng was actually very fond of this sort of feeling.<br>After all, he was destined to be someone that disliked comfort.<br>Besides, the All-heaven Starfield was also the territory of the All-heaven Sect.<br>The All-heaven Sect had attempted to subjugate the Ancestral Martial Starfield to be under their rule, and had nearly succeeded.<br>As someone from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Chu Feng felt very displeased by that.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng had never thought about simply returning to the Ancestral Martial Starfield after arriving there.<br>Chu Feng had decided to cause havoc in the All-heaven Starfield.<br>Otherwise, he would not be able to appease his resentment.<br></p></div>
