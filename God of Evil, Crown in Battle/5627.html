        <h1>Chapter 5627: The Young Master of the Immortal Spirit Manor</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several days passed in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder would always arrive on time to collect Chu Feng&rsquo;s crops, but he didn&rsquo;t speak a word about Chu Feng&rsquo;s murder. Someone would have surely reported the matter to the elder, but the elder didn&rsquo;t punish him. This showed that they truly didn&rsquo;t care about this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Chen Hui hadn&rsquo;t harvested a single crop in the last few days. He was completely focused on examining the sickle and the crops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I finally get it!&rdquo; Chen Hui suddenly exclaimed out of delight in the early morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He manually harvested the crops with his sickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng initially noticed some mistakes with Chen Hui&rsquo;s movements and wanted to point them out, but he noticed that Chen Hui was making adjustments to correct his mistakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like Chen Hui&rsquo;s intelligence is above Bai </span><span>Yunqing&rsquo;s</span><span>.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> would have fared better than Chen Hui here. This showed how terrifyingly talented Chen Hui was. It was only a matter of time before Chen Hui overtook Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chen Hui diligently harvested the crops from early morning till afternoon. It took him eight hours before he finally finished harvesting all of his crops. When he was finally done, he plopped onto the ground and gasped for air. Sweat rained from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was exhausted, but there was a satisfied smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Tired?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t easy at all. Is it that tough for normal farmers when they harvest crops too?&rdquo; Chen Hui murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course. Their work is ten times more tiring than ours,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you serious? They don&rsquo;t have to study and align the formations; all they have to do is to harvest the crops. How can their work be ten times more tiring than ours?&rdquo; Chen Hui asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;They are doing it with their mortal bodies. That&rsquo;s bound to be tiring,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why do they still do that then?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for their family and themselves. It&rsquo;s their way of survival.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You know quite a bit. Are you on close terms with a mortal?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I used to be a mortal too.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You were born in the Lower Realm?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Mmhm</span><span>.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Which Lower Realm?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of answering the question, Chu Feng asked, &ldquo;Do you want my pointers?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;No need, no need. Please don&rsquo;t offer me any pointers. I know I can still do better than this,&rdquo; Chen Hui replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Feel free to tell me if you require help,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; Chen Hui replied with a radiant smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive pillar suddenly gushed into the sky, breaching Chu Feng&rsquo;s barrier. Two people, a man and a woman, flew through the breach and headed in Chu Feng&rsquo;s direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was dashing, whereas the woman was a fair-skinned beauty. It was evident that the two of them were extremely powerful from the patterns on their world spiritist robes. The woman was at Blue Dragon God-cloak, whereas the man was at Gold Dragon God-cloak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They carried tokens on their waist bearing the words &lsquo;Immortal Spirit Manor&rsquo;.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Immortal Spirit Manor? </span><span>Finally</span><span> a decent opponent,&rdquo; Chen Hui murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them had come into proximity, but they chose to remain in the sky to gaze down on Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You are Chu Feng?&rdquo; the woman asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you blind or illiterate?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How dare you speak to me in this manner? Do you know who I am?&rdquo; The woman frowned in displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Calm down, junior.&rdquo; The man stopped the woman before turning to smile at Chu Feng. &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, I am the young master of the Seven Realms Galaxy&rsquo;s Immortal Spirit Manor, Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>. This is my junior, Song Yuping. We don&rsquo;t bear any ill-will toward you. It was out of no choice that we breached your barrier. We simply wanted to befriend you, but that barrier was in our path, so please pardon us.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What business do you have with me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I know that all of the agricultural fields are the same; the secret behind harvesting better crops lies in the sickle&rsquo;s formation and the crops. Young master Chu Feng, you must have grasped the secret to harvest such high-quality crops. I wonder if you would be willing to share the secret with us. Of course, I&rsquo;m more than willing to pay you handsomely for that,&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;My apologies. I don&rsquo;t intend to share my secret,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Song Yuping pointed her finger at Chu Feng and snarled. &ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t test our patience.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes turned cold. &ldquo;Watch your words. It&rsquo;s not just one or two women who have died in my hands.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Oh? You want to kill me? Hah, do you think that you can act as you please just because you&rsquo;re a Gold Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist? You must not know what kind of palace our Immortal Spirit Manor is to dare threaten me!&rdquo; Song Yuping sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>, as if hinting at him to teach Chu Feng a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> didn&rsquo;t make a move right away, but his attitude was clearly less amicable than before. &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, the world of cultivation is deep. It&rsquo;s better to make a friend than an enemy. I&rsquo;ll give you some time to think about it. However, I ask you to show some respect to my junior. She is an influential person in our Immortal Spirit Manor. I won&rsquo;t be able to help you if you offend her.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not waste time. I have already told you my decision, so you may leave now. Young miss, I&rsquo;m more than willing to play with you if that&rsquo;s what you want, but I don&rsquo;t know if you can bear the consequence,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao&rsquo;s</span><span> eyes turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Eyy</span><span>, young master Zhao! You want to know the correct way to harvest the crops, right? I know the secret behind that too,&rdquo; Chen Hui suddenly spoke up with a chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You know it too?&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> assessed Chen Hui with contemptuous eyes. He didn&rsquo;t seem to believe the latter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I do. Why don&rsquo;t you wait a while? The elder is arriving soon. You&rsquo;ll know very soon whether I&rsquo;m lying or not,&rdquo; Chen Hui replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Stop blowing your own trumpet. You don&rsquo;t have the talent for that. Senior, let&rsquo;s go. Chu Feng clearly doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s better for him. He&rsquo;ll know the consequences for offending us once we&rsquo;re out of here,&rdquo; Song Yuping said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait a little longer. The elder is arriving soon,&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Senior, you can&rsquo;t possibly think that fatty is smart enough to decipher the secret here, right? After all, you&hellip;&rdquo; Song Yuping hurriedly shut her mouth halfway through. She didn&rsquo;t think that her senior would take the subsequent half of her words too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re already here anyway. We can afford to stay a little longer,&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> replied. He then turned to Chen Hui and said, &ldquo;I assume you&rsquo;re aware of the consequences of wasting my time?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I know, I know. Relax, I am a person of my word,&rdquo; Chen Hui replied with a wide grin.</span></p></div>
