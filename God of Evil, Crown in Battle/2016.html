        <div> - Merging With The Three Immortal Profound Techniques<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, you absolutely cannot do this. The Immortality Peaches are extremely precious. Earlier, you already gave me three. I already can&rsquo;t thank you enough for that. As such, I absolutely cannot accept these two Immortality Peaches,&rdquo; the Snow Blade Mad Demon refused repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I am not giving you these two Immortality Peaches because I feel sympathy for you. Rather, I am doing so to express my thanks,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Express your thanks?&rdquo; Snow Blade Mad Demon was confused.<br>&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t uphold virtue and condemn evil by saving a family that was unrelated to you, your family would not have met their tragic deaths.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are a kindhearted man. Else, you would not have courted that disaster. I am thanking you on behalf of the people of the world,&rdquo; Chu Feng forcibly pushed the two Immortality Peaches into the Snow Blade Mad Demon&rsquo;s hands.<br>Then, Chu Feng turned around to leave. He was afraid that the Snow Blade Mad Demon would refuse again.<br>After Chu Feng left, Snow Blade Mad Demon held the two Immortality Peaches in his hands and stood there motionlessly for a very long time. Then, he wiped away the tears on his face and looked to the many memorial tablets behind him. He said, &ldquo;I will definitely avenge you all.&rdquo;<br>The next morning, Chu Feng called for the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, the Immeasurable Immortal, the Snow-haired Immortal and Zhang Ming, the several Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists in the Cyanwood Mountain.<br>&ldquo;What? Chu Feng&hellip; you plan to merge the Gold Immortal Profound Technique, Wood Immortal Profound Technique and the Earth Immortal Profound Technique into your body all at once?&rdquo; At that moment, the Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists present were all startled.<br>&ldquo;The Five Elements Secret Skills contains a treasure. I need to obtain it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;But, the Five Elements Secret Skills cannot coexist in one body,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;It is not that they cannot coexist. Rather, they have a relatively high requirement for a person&rsquo;s soul.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I wish to give it a try. The reason why I called seniors here is because I wanted seniors to help me with one thing,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal asked.<br>&ldquo;If I am to fail, seniors, please help me set up that protective barrier around the Cyanwood Mountain so as to ensure the safety of our Cyanwood Mountain,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, why must you put yourself through this? Even if you wish to fight against the Dark Hall, there is no need for you to be this impatient,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others tried to urge Chu Feng against it. None of them wished for Chu Feng to take this risk.<br>The reason for that was because this was truly too dangerous. Even though Chu Feng had successfully managed to have the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique coexist in his body, it did not mean that he would be able to have all Five Elements Secret Skills coexist in his body.<br>Since ancient times, many people had attempted to assimilate the Five Elements Secret Skills into their bodies. However, even for the person who had managed to accomplish the best result, he had only managed to contain three of the Five Elements Secret Skills. Furthermore, not long after he succeeded, his body exploded and he died. As such, in the end, he had still failed.<br>Right at that moment, the Immeasurable Immortal said, &ldquo;Everyone, since little friend Chu Feng is already determined, it is useless for us to continue urging him against it. Rather than pressuring him, it&lsquo;s better that we support him and give him some motivation,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Immeasurable, you can&rsquo;t say it like that. Naturally, we will support Chu Feng. However, we couldn&rsquo;t possibly support him with everything regardless of what it might be, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We clearly know that this is an extremely dangerous matter. If we still allow Chu Feng to do it, wouldn&rsquo;t it be us harming him?&rdquo; The Snow-haired Immortal was insistent on not having Chu Feng merge with the other Secret Skills. In fact, when the Immeasurable Immortal voiced his support for Chu Feng, she even displayed a displeased expression toward the Immeasurable Immortal.<br>As for the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others, they were not as emotional as the Snow-haired Immortal. However, it remained that their expressions were slightly ugly. Like the Snow-haired Immortal, they also did not wish for Chu Feng to do such a dangerous thing.<br>&ldquo;While others cannot accomplish it, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it would be impossible for little friend Chu Feng. Before this, has there ever been anyone capable of creating a spirit formation that could safeguard against attacks from peak Martial Emperors? No one was able to accomplish that. However, little friend Chu Feng accomplished it!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, why did the Underworld Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master insist on giving little friend Chu Feng the Earth Immortal Profound Technique? It&rsquo;s because he wanted Chu Feng to undo the mystery of the Five Elements Secret Skill,&rdquo; The Immeasurable Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;The hell do you know,&rdquo; The Snow-haired Immortal was so angered that she actually cursed out at the Immeasurable Immortal.<br>&ldquo;You are beyond redemption,&rdquo; The Immeasurable Immortal snorted coldly. Then, he turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, this old man supports you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thank you senior,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist toward the Immeasurable Immortal. Then, he turned to clasp his fists toward the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, the Snow-haired Immortal and the other Dragon Mark World Spiritists, &ldquo;Seniors, if I am to fail, I will have to depend on you all for that spirit formation.&rdquo;<br>Then, Chu Feng did not bother with their reactions. He took out the outline of that grand defensive spirit formation, and began to explain the various essential aspects of that spirit formation to the several Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists present.<br>In response, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, the Immeasurable Immortal and the others began to carefully listen to Chu Feng&rsquo;s explanation. Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s outline diagram had already simplified the grand spirit formation enormously, it was still extremely difficult for them to set it up.<br>However, after listening to Chu Feng&rsquo;s explanation, everything became clear to them. Soon, they understood the various aspects of the spirit formation that they were unable to understand before.<br>The reason why they listened to Chu Feng&rsquo;s explanation so earnestly was not only because they wanted to grasp that spirit formation. In addition to that, it was because they knew that Chu Feng was determined, and they would not be able to stop him.<br>They were truly afraid that Chu Feng would fail. As such, they did not wish for the Cyanwood Mountain to be unprotected after Chu Feng&rsquo;s death.<br>Thus, although they did not accept Chu Feng&rsquo;s request, if something were to happen to Chu Feng, they would still set up that grand defensive spirit formation over the Cyanwood Mountain to protect the people of the Cyanwood Mountain.<br>After two entire days and nights, Chu Feng finally finished explaining the essential aspects of that grand defensive spirit formation to the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others.<br>The reason why Chu Feng did this was merely because he wanted to guard against the unexpected. He did not really think that he would definitely die should he attempt to assimilate with the remaining three secret skills. In fact, Chu Feng felt a great certainty of success.<br>After all, when Chu Feng assimilated the Fire Immortal Profound Technique into him, he did not feel any pressure whatsoever, This led him to know that his spirit and soul were extremely powerful. He was certain that they would be able to withstand the pressure from the Five Elements Secret Skills.<br>After the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others left, Chu Feng did not hesitate. He immediately closed the doors to the room and took out the Gold Immortal Profound Technique, the Wood Immortal Profound Technique and the Earth Immortal Profound Technique.<br>However, Chu Feng used a special method to remove Her Lady Queen from his world spirit space.<br>This was also because Chu Feng wished to prevent against the unexpected. If he were truly unfortunate enough to fail, then he would die.<br>Chu Feng did not wish for Her Lady Queen to die together with him.<br>&ldquo;Milady Queen, if I am to truly die, I hope that you will not blame me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is not that I am shortsighted and only seeking instant benefits. It is merely that the current situation is truly bad. If the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves are unable to hold back the Dark Hall, even if I am able to set up a spirit formation that could defend against peak Martial Emperors, it would not be able to defend against the Dark Hall forever.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I must increase my strength quickly so that I can help the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves defeat the Dark Hall. This is my responsibility. After all, that Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master is my fellow clansman.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And now, these Five Elements Secret Skills are the greatest opportunity for me to increase my strength. I cannot miss out on this opportunity,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to the sleeping Lady Queen and spoke with a beaming smile on his face.<br>Then, before Her Lady Queen, Chu Feng removed the seals on the Gold Immortal Profound Technique, the Wood Immortal Profound Technique and the Earth Immortal Profound Technique.<br>&ldquo;Hualalala~~~&rdquo;<br>The unsealing of the three Supreme Secret Skills in unison caused the palace hall that Chu Feng was in to tremble, and boundless might to appear out of nowhere.<br>Soon, three boundlessly imposing figures appeared before Chu Feng.<br>These three silhouettes were all emitting ample auras of immortality. They were the Gold Immortal, Wood Immortal and Earth Immortal.<br><br></p></div>
