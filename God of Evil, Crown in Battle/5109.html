        <h1>Chapter 5108</h1>
        <div>: Emergence of the Vestige<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Elder, please accept this.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng took out another Cosmos Sack and handed it to the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you need not stand on ceremony with me.&rdquo;<br>The Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster turned down the gift.<br>&ldquo;Elder, you have helped me more than what this small gift is worth. I&rsquo;d feel much better if you can accept this,&rdquo; Chu Feng said earnestly.<br>He had previously requested the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster to protect Gu Mingyuan and Chu Lingxi, and the latter had held to the end of his promise, nearly losing his life in the process. Even when he was threatened by Shengguang Xuanye, he still refused to hand Gu Mingyuan and Chu Lingxi over.<br>This was a debt that Chu Feng felt obliged to repay.<br>&ldquo;You sure are&hellip; Alright, I&rsquo;ll accept it. What you have to do now is to work hard on your cultivation. Our entire Holy Light Galaxy is counting on you to make us proud,&rdquo; the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster said.<br>He took the Cosmos Sack and opened it up, only to frown right after. The items inside the Cosmos Sack were simply too valuable.<br>&ldquo;These are all treasures. Is it too late for me to turn down the gift?&rdquo; the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late. Elder, you&rsquo;ll have no choice but to accept it,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a chuckle.<br>&ldquo;Take it. You deserve it,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>&ldquo;Since Lord Baimei has already said so, I&rsquo;ll humbly accept this gift.&rdquo;<br>In the end, the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster stowed the Cosmos Sack away. He even jokingly said, &ldquo;It looks like my investment paid off.&rdquo;<br>The crowd laughed.<br>It might be a joke, but it was the truth too. They were people who had witnessed Chu Feng&rsquo;s growth, and they knew what kind of person he was. It was indeed a worthwhile investment to get on good terms with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Lingxi, I wish to take you in as my disciple. Can I have the honor of becoming your master?&rdquo; Daoist Niantian suddenly said.<br>The crowd was stunned. They didn&rsquo;t expect Daoist Niantian to suddenly make such a request.<br>Gu Mingyuan was stunned for a moment before her face lit up in delight. She turned to look at Chu Lingxi, likely sending voice transmissions to the latter.<br>Daoist Niantian was a formidable figure in the Holy Light Galaxy. It would be a huge honor to become his disciple. Chu Lingxi was aware of that too, which was why she was delighted by the offer.<br>But before Chu Lingxi could speak up, Shengguang Baimei suddenly interjected, &ldquo;Niantian, are you going to snatch her from me?&rdquo;<br>Once again, everyone was stunned. Did that mean that Shengguang Baimei wanted to take Chu Lingxi in as his disciple too? Aside from spirit power, Shengguang Baimei was indubitably the stronger cultivator and wielded greater influence than Daoist Niantian.<br>&ldquo;Elder Baimei, you wish to take my little sister as your disciple too?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;This lass catches my eye. I&rsquo;m thinking of bringing her to the Holy Valley as a companion to my granddaughter. Chu Feng, you don&rsquo;t have to worry. I&rsquo;ll make sure to impart her with everything I know. She might not be a member of our Holy Valley, but she&rsquo;ll receive our true teaching,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>His intention was clear. He was making this offer only because he liked Chu Lingxi, not because he thought that Chu Lingxi was talented. To put it frankly, he was doing this because of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, I was the first one to make the offer,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>It was apparent from his tone that he didn&rsquo;t want to give Chu Lingxi up to Shengguang Baimei.<br>&ldquo;Niantian, are you intending to compete with me over this?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei asked in displeasure.<br>His gaze carried a hint of threat, but Daoist Niantian was a stubborn man too. He wouldn&rsquo;t give up that easily.<br>&ldquo;Elder Baimei, Elder Niantian, why don&rsquo;t you let my little sister choose instead?&rdquo; Chu Feng interjected.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Let Lingxi make her own decision,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said confidently.<br>Daoist Niantian and everyone else turned their sights to Chu Lingxi, heaping great pressure on her. Gu Mingyuan even felt sweat trickling down her back. She was worried for her daughter.<br>Regardless of how close Chu Feng was with Daoist Niantian and Shengguang Baimei, those two were still powerhouses that neither Gu Mingyuan nor Chu Lingxi could afford to get on bad terms with. To have Chu Lingxi choose between them meant that she was bound to offend one of them.<br>However, Chu Lingxi was much more light-hearted about the issue. She made up her decision without much hesitation.<br>She walked up to Shengguang Baimei and said, &ldquo;Lord Baimei, I&rsquo;m flattered by your offer, but I have admired Daoist Niantian from a young age. I ask you to forgive me for turning down your offer.&rdquo;<br>She then bowed deeply to Shengguang Baimei.<br>It was not a surprising decision. While Shengguang Baimei was superior in terms of cultivation and standing, the better teacher of them two was clearly Daoist Niantian.<br>&ldquo;Eyy! I can only say that you have bad eyes.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei wasn&rsquo;t happy about the situation, but he didn&rsquo;t say much about it. Even if it was just on Chu Feng&rsquo;s account, he wouldn&rsquo;t make things difficult for Chu Lingxi and Daoist Niantian.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, you don&rsquo;t need to feel disappointed about this. I&rsquo;ll be residing in the Holy Valley anyway. I won&rsquo;t stop you if you wish to teach young friend Lingxi anything,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Shoo shoo, you can teach your disciple on your own. Don&rsquo;t even think about taking advantage of me.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei rolled his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Master, are we going to the Holy Valley too? But my mother&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked.<br>Before Daoist Niantian could say a word, Shengguang Baimei had already replied, &ldquo;Of course your mother can go with you. Niantian doesn&rsquo;t have much say in the Holy Valley, but the same can&rsquo;t be said about young friend Chu Feng. In fact, you can bring anyone you wish into the Holy Valley,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>He then turned to Chu Feng and continued on, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, our Holy Valley will always welcome you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thank you, elder.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng quickly bowed to Shengguang Baimei, knowing that it was an offer from the Holy Valley to protect his family and friends. It was a huge step for the Holy Valley to accord such treatment to an outsider, considering how arrogant they were.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, since you&rsquo;re back, let&rsquo;s visit the Darknight Sacred River together,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi suddenly said.<br>&ldquo;Darknight Sacred River?&rdquo;<br>Those three words brought up some memories in Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind. There were Six Great Sacred Vestiges in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, and they were namely the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain, Ethereal Sacred Gate, Nine Moons Sacred Domain, Purple Sun Sacred Palace, Void Sacred Tree, and Darknight Sacred River.<br>The Darknight Sacred River was an elusive river that only appeared in the night. It could appear anywhere, be it on the plain, on the tallest mountain, within the ocean, in the sky, or even deep underground. The random locations of its appearance made it a rare sight.<br>The river was said to be made out of gold, shimmering with majestic splendor under the stars. Any water scooped out of the river would immediately turn into gold, and it was not just any ordinary gold. The gold from the river was a precious material that could be used to forge powerful immortal weapons.<br>For that reason, the gold was called Darknight Sacred Gold.<br>It was also said that there was a mysterious treasure hidden in the depths of the water, just that no one had ever found the treasure.<br>It had been many years since there was any news about the Darknight Sacred River due to its random appearances and its short period of manifestation. Chu Feng had only heard of the stories but had never seen it in person.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re referring to one of the Six Great Sacred Vestiges?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. That&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;m referring to,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi replied with a nod.<br>&ldquo;The Darknight Sacred River appeared? You know where it is?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I do. In fact, everyone in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm knows. Haven&rsquo;t you heard the rumors on your way here?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked.<br>Chu Feng had come here in a hurry, such that he hadn&rsquo;t heard anything about the Darknight Sacred River. He only knew that the Holy Light Clan had built palaces for the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t the Darknight Sacred River only appear for a short period of time? It should have disappeared by the time news spread all over the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, no?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The Darknight Sacred River that appeared this time around seems to be different. It&rsquo;s still there right now. We were just planning to head over to take a look. Why don&rsquo;t we head there together?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br></p></div>
