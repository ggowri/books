        <div> - Refused<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>At that moment, Chu Feng was steering the spatial warship and moving toward the direction of the Transmogrification Gate. The rescue operation was winding down right now. All of the spatial warships had completed their rescue missions and begun to proceed toward the direction of the Transmogrification Gate.<br>The reason for that was because it was reported from an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; territory that tracks from the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had been found. Fortunately, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves there had already been evacuated. Else, they would have suffered enormously.<br>The reason for that was because that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; territory had already been turned into ruins. Not only had it been ruined, there was also an appalling scene of devastation left behind.<br>Thus, it was currently certain that the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had begun to attack. Even though there were a lot of powers and a lot of people to be saved still, they had to give up on them.<br>The reason for that was because all of the spatial warships had received orders from the Elf King. As such, all of the spatial warships were proceeding toward the location of the Transmogrification Gate.<br>When unleashing his full power, Chu Feng possessed the strength of a rank eight Martial Emperor. Thus, the spatial warship that he steered was extremely fast.<br>At that moment, the World Spiritist Immortal, the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master and the others that possessed close relationships with Chu Feng were all stunned.<br>Firstly, they had not expected that during the time when they started the grand formation to isolate themselves from the Holy Land of Martialism till now, so many things would have happened in the Holy Land of Martialism. In fact, it had reached a point where a calamity was about to befall the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>That being said, they were even more shocked by Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength. None of them had expected Chu Feng to become this much more powerful in such a short period of time.<br>&ldquo;Milord, what level of cultivation does little friend Chu Feng possess now?&rdquo; Feeling curious, the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master turned to ask the World Spiritist Immortal.<br>Hearing that question, Sima Ying and the others all turned their gazes over. As Chu Feng was steering the warship, it was unsuitable for them to bother him. However, they also wished to know what Chu Feng&rsquo;s current cultivation was. Thus, they could only turn their hopes to the World Spiritist Immortal. After all, he was one of the Ten Immortals, and the strongest person in their World Spiritist Alliance.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. However, the way I see it, there are less than ten people in the current Holy Land of Martialism that would be able to contend against little friend Chu Feng,&rdquo; The World Spiritist Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;Sssss~~~&rdquo;<br>instantly the crowd all sucked in a mouthful of cold air as they looked to Chu Feng again.<br>While this came as a shock for all of them, for Sima Ying and the others who had known Chu Feng personally back when he was still very weak, they were feeling extremely complicated right now.<br>Although they had all progressed, it remained that they were of the younger generation, and could not compare with people from the older generations.<br>However, Chu Feng, someone who used to possess the same level of strength as them, someone who used to be weaker than them, had grown to become so powerful that even their World Spiritist Immortal could not fathom his strength.<br>Laughing happily, Sima Ying asked Miao Renlong, who was beside her, &ldquo;Grandpa Miao, say, could this be considered to be witnessing the rise of an overlord?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Miao Renlong shook his head with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that? Could it be that Chu Feng, even with his strength, is still unable to become an overlord?&rdquo; Sima Ying asked in a confused manner.<br>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Miao Renlong shook his head again, &ldquo;What I meant is that it was not only you who has witnessed the rise of an overlord, but rather all of us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Haha, Grandpa Miao, you&rsquo;re so bad. You&rsquo;re actually teasing me,&rdquo; Hearing those words, Sima Ying burst into loud laughter. Her laughter was very brilliant, and was exactly the same as it had been years ago.<br>However, she suddenly looked to Chu Feng again. As she looked to Chu Feng&rsquo;s back view, her laughter suddenly froze.<br>Even though she had considered Chu Feng to be her best friend, she suddenly felt unfamiliarity from Chu Feng.<br>It was not that Chu Feng had done something to her. Rather, she felt that sort of sensation herself.<br>The current Chu Feng was someone even the World Spiritist Immortal was very respectful toward. For a nobody like herself, could she still remain Chu Feng&rsquo;s friend?<br>Thinking about it, Sima Ying suddenly felt heartache, and involuntarily lowered her head in a dispirited manner.<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice sounded. &ldquo;Hey, what are you blanking out for?&rdquo;<br>Hearing that voice, Sima Ying&rsquo;s petite body immediately trembled. She raised her head, and discovered that Chu Feng, who was still steering the warship, was currently looking at her with a beaming smile on his face.<br>That smile was so very familiar.<br>Suddenly Sima Ying suddenly felt warmth in her heart. She was so emotional that the corners of her eyes started to grow moist.<br>It turned out that Chu Feng was still the same Chu Feng. He had not distanced himself because he had become more powerful. It turned out that she had been overthinking things.<br>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you coming over here to chat with me? It&rsquo;s very lonely for me to steer the warship myself,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with another smile.<br>&ldquo;Haha, I just didn&rsquo;t want to disturb you,&rdquo; At that moment, Sima Ying also smiled brilliantly. As she spoke, she secretly wiped away the tears at the corners of her eyes. Then, she happily ran over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side.<br>Jumping and hopping, she still looked like a little girl. However, she did not notice that there were countless gazes looking at her from behind. Those gazes were all filled with deep admiration and envy.<br>To be able to be this intimate with Chu Feng was something that countless people could only dream of now.<br>However, Sima Ying had achieved such a thing. It was not that Sima Ying was lucky. Rather, it was because she had become Chu Feng&rsquo;s friend during the time when he needed friends the most. She had helped him during the time when he needed help the most.<br>&hellip;...<br>After continuing on with their journey, the spatial warship that Chu Feng was piloting finally arrived at an uninhabited location.<br>This was truly an uninhabited land devoid of human habitation. In other words, this place was completely overgrown with vegetation, and simply uninhabited.<br>However, at that moment, over a hundred spatial warships had appeared in this uninhabited land. Furthermore, all of the spatial warships contained at least several tens of millions of humans or monstrous beasts. The spatial warships that contained the most people contained over a hundred million people.<br>However, when compared to the population of the Holy Land of Martialism, this was still a very small amount. Thus, when Chu Feng saw that many spatial warships were gathered here, and there were still more spatial warships incoming after they landed, Chu Feng felt grieved in his heart.<br>Even though he had already known this was going to happen, when all of this actually happened, when he thought of how so many people would end up dying at the hands of the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, Chu Feng still ended up blaming himself endlessly.<br>It was because he was not strong enough; he was unable to protect the lives of the living things in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve finally arrived.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Lord Lianghua, Lord Luokong, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others appeared. They were awaiting Chu Feng&rsquo;s arrival.<br>Chu Feng hurriedly descended from the spatial warship and arrived before Lord Lianghua and the others.<br>&ldquo;Those people over there, they seem to be the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; Grand Elders, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens, little friend Chu Feng has become so powerful now. Even the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; Grand Elders are this intimate with him?&rdquo;<br>Seeing how the grand characters of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves were being this friendly with Chu Feng, the experts from the World Spiritist Alliance that were still in the warship&rsquo;s isolated space all felt their hearts tremble.<br>In fact, it was not only them. All of the people from the various other warships were acting the same way.<br>The reason for that was because even though they were all in their respective warships&rsquo; isolated spaces, they were able to see everything that was happening outside.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the situation? Is that Transmogrification Gate here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s in the vicinity. Furthermore, His Majesty has already taken Princess Miaomiao to go through and contact the Heaven Reaching Immortal. Whether or not we will succeed will all depend on this,&rdquo; Lord Luokong said.<br>&ldquo;There shouldn&rsquo;t be any mishap, I hope,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a slightly worried tone.<br>&ldquo;There shouldn&rsquo;t be. After all, countless lives are gathered here. I refuse to believe that the Heaven Reaching Immortal would be so heartless as to refuse to see us,&rdquo; Lord Lianghua said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the Elf King&rsquo;s voice sounded. Following that, the space beside Chu Feng started to tremble. Then, two figures appeared. They were the Elf King and Xian Miaomiao.<br>Merely, this time around, the two of them possessed unsightly expressions on their faces. Especially Xian Miaomiao. She had a face filled with complaints.<br>Seeing this scene, Chu Feng started to frown. However, he still walked forward and asked, &ldquo;Your Majesty, how was it?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Elf King did not say anything. However, he lightly shook his head.<br>At this moment, the expressions of Chu Feng and the others all changed enormously.<br>They knew that they have been refused admission.<br><br></p></div>
