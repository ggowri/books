        <div> - Broaden Your Horizons<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;What a strong martial skill! This might...It is a rank 6 martial skill?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not a rank 6 martial skill. It&rsquo;s the rank 5 martial skill from the Qilin Prince&rsquo;s Mansion, the extremely famous Ten Thousand Galloping Horses!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a martial skill from the Qilin Prince&rsquo;s Mansion? The martial skills there are the best of the best, but they never pass it down to outsiders! Yet Gong Luyun learnt it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your news is truly not too efficient. Right now, Gong Luyun has an extremely outstanding foster grandfather. It&rsquo;s Lord Lin Ran from the head managerof the Lin clan from the Qilin Prince&rsquo;s Mansion! With him, which martial skill can Gong Luyun not learn?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So there&rsquo;s actually something like that...So this means that Gong Luyun&rsquo;s background is quite terrifyingly deep. But then, why does such a character need to stay in the Azure Dragon School?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The important part is not whether Gong Luyun is able to learn this Ten Thousand Galloping Horses or not. The important thing is that Gong Luyun can so perfectly grasp this martial skill. To know that even though this martial skill is strong, the cultivating difficulty is extremely high.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This martial skill is too impressive. Normal martial skills can simply not fight against it. How will Chu Feng respond this time?&rdquo;<br>Gong Luyun&rsquo;s Ten Thousand Galloping Horses made people endlessly sigh in admiration. At the same time, people also locked their gazes onto Chu Feng. They wanted to see how Chu Feng was going to fight against the martial skill that pressured with might.<br>&ldquo;Such Ten Thousand Galloping Horses. Then I, Chu Feng, will use &lsquo;Shooting Ten Thousand Horses with Arrows&rsquo;!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng put one leg forward and slightly bent it up, then his other leg backwards and slightly bent it down. He formed a bow in his left hand, and formed an arrow in his right. Then, as his left hand swung, his right hand was like a blade. Countless golden-coloured arrows shot towards the galloping horses like a rainstorm.<br>*whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh*<br>*neigh neigh neigh neigh*<br>Truly, not a single arrow that Chu Feng shot was useless. In the instant that the golden-coloured arrows shot into the horses, the horses with strong might all fell one after the other and miserable cries rang out. After that, they formed into layers of Profound power and disappeared in the sky. The so-called strongest rank 5 martial skill from the Qilin Prince&rsquo;s Mansion was so easily defeated by Chu Feng&rsquo;s Bow of Hundred Transformations.<br>&ldquo;Tsk tsk tsk, the so-called Ten Thousand Galloping Horses is only that? You don&rsquo;t learn the martial skills from your own school, and you had to learn someone else&rsquo;s martial skills. It seems like you truly shame my Azure Dragon School&rsquo;s ancestor!&rdquo; Chu Feng mockingly smiled and said.<br>&ldquo;So that means that what Chu Feng just used was a martial skill from the Azure Dragon School? Strong. Truly strong! Although the might of that martial skill did not seem to be strong, in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands, it showed exceeding power and it easily killed off Gong Luyun&rsquo;s Ten Thousand Galloping Horses!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So like the legends said, no matter how much stronger martial skills are, they must be used by the appropriate person. Even garbage martial skills can be used to display extremely strong power in the hands of experts?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words made everyone think again. Everyone kept on praising Chu Feng. If Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power was raised by relying on some special method, then the use and comprehension towards martial skills were undoubtedly his own talent and ability.<br>&ldquo;Quite a bit of useless words. People like you can only stay within the Azure Dragon School for your entire life. You will never know what martial skills are truly strong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, I will let you broaden your horizons. I will let you experience a martial skill that you have never experienced before. A legendary rank 6 martial skill!&rdquo;<br>Gong Luyun was really forced into anxiety by Chu Feng. He waved his big sleeve, and the air around him quickly flowed and interweaved with the Profound power in his body. At that instant, icy-cold, bone-piercing gas started to speedily spread. Even the people who were watching the arena felt a bit of the coldness.<br>The cold air lingering on the fighting stage was even more terrifying. Frost had already been condensed out on the stage and it was currently surrounding and getting closer to Chu Feng. At that instant, the fighting stage was like a land of ice and snow.<br>&ldquo;This bone-piercing coldness. This terrifying might. Is this one of the fortification martial skills in the Qilin Prince&rsquo;s Mansion, the rank 6 martial skill, Cold Ice Atmosphere?&rdquo;<br>[TN: Again, &ldquo;fortification&rdquo; {something</p></div>
