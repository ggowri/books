        <h1>Chapter 3327</h1>
        <div> - Utmost Exalted-level Expert<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are unable to stop me.&rdquo;<br>After the Moon Immortal said those words, Su Rou and Su Mei&rsquo;s clothes began to flutter.<br>In an instant, the surroundings were filled with a burst of power so strong that it caused everyone present to feel as if they were suffocating.<br>At that moment, the crowd all felt that they were extremely weak and small. With a single thought from their opponent, they would meet a horrible death and have their souls destroyed.<br>All of the people present were grand characters in terms of both status and cultivation. They were people that were arrogant, aloof and considered others to be powerless ants.<br>However, at that moment, they felt as if they were the powerless ants.<br>They felt that their fate was under the rule of another.<br>&ldquo;This aura, could it be&hellip; above that of an Exalted?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Two young ladies, the two of you have reached&hellip; the Utmost Exalted realm?&rdquo;<br>Shock filled Liangqiu Chengfeng&rsquo;s face. Someone of his caliber had seen all sorts of things. However, his expression would usually remain unchanged. Yet, at that moment, even he was astonished and frightened.<br>He was practically certain that the two young women before him were Utmost Exalted-level experts.<br>But, the Utmost Exalted realm was an extremely powerful cultivation realm. Even he was quite some distance from the Utmost Exalted realm.<br>Thus, how could he not be astonished when two people from the younger generation actually possessed Utmost Exalted-level cultivation?<br>&ldquo;What?! Utmost Exalted?!&rdquo;<br>After Liangqiu Chengfeng finished saying those words, even greater fear covered the faces of the crowd that were already shivering in fear.<br>After all, the Utmost Exalted realm was a cultivation realm that they could not possibly contend with.<br>Although they were questioned by Liangqiu Chengfeng, neither Su Rou nor Su Mei bothered to respond.<br>Instead, they swept their gazes across the crowd and spoke in an ice-cold tone, &ldquo;All of you, listen carefully. If any of you dares to make things difficult for Chu Feng, regardless of who you might be, I will bring about the extermination of your entire clan.&rdquo;<br>After they finished saying those words, Su Rou and Su Mei cast their eyes to Li Taiyi.<br>At that moment, Li Taiyi&rsquo;s face turned pale with fright. He was so scared that his body began to shiver.<br>Li Taiyi was someone who remained unyielding even when faced with Liangqiu Chengfeng or Song Boqiu, who had seriously injured him.<br>The entire time, he continued to maintain his position that he would take care of Chu Feng, take care of the Chu Heavenly Clan, and get revenge on Song Boqiu.<br>However, at that moment, facing the gaze from Su Rou and Su Mei, he became afraid.<br>Li Taiyi, someone who had never feared anything before, was feeling fear from the bottom of his heart. He was so afraid that he did not even dare to speak.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, you&rsquo;re on your own now.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Su Rou and Su Mei&rsquo;s bodies shifted, and they disappeared.<br>After Su Rou and Su Mei left, that overwhelmingly oppressive sensation also disappeared. At that moment, the crowd all breathed deeply in relief that they&rsquo;d regained their freedom.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, who are they?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you know those two demonesses?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd all arrived before Chu Feng to ask him about Su Rou and Su Mei.<br>However, none of them dared to demand that Chu Feng hand over the cultivation resources. Not even Song Boqiu dared to do so.<br>The reason for that was because what was said by those two demonesses earlier was not only heard by them with their ears, but it was also imprinted onto their hearts.<br>Most importantly, they were able to tell that those two demonesses were not joking around. Furthermore, those two demonesses really did possess the strength to wipe out their entire clan.<br>Those two demonesses were existences capable of stirring enormous waves in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield. No one was willing to offend them.<br>At the same time, no one was willing to offend Chu Feng, who they'd declared that they would protect.<br>&ldquo;I am unable to inform everyone about the two of them,&rdquo; after Chu Feng finished saying those words, he arrived beside the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, &ldquo;Senior, how are you doing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, brother Chu&rsquo;s injuries are not too serious,&rdquo; the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief stepped forward.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, then we will be leaving this place,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Right, right, right. Since the treasure has already been snatched away, it&rsquo;s meaningless for us to continue to stay here. Let us quickly leave this place before the situation changes,&rdquo; the crowd all expressed their agreement after Chu Feng said those words.<br>Had it been before, they would definitely not be willing to leave just like that should they not be able to obtain the treasure. They would definitely demand that Chu Feng return the cultivation resources that they&rsquo;d given him. However, at that moment, even if Chu Feng was willing to hand the cultivation resources back to them, they would not necessarily dare to accept them.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that they were cowardly. It was merely that the earlier threat from the Moon Immortal was simply too frightening.<br>Afterwards, the crowd left the the Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant in succession.<br>Song Boqiu, Li Taiyi and Li Ruochu left directly.<br>As for the others, they did not leave directly, but instead began to try to curry a favorable relationship with the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Originally, they had looked down on the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. However at this moment, they all wanted to have a friendly relationship with the Chu Heavenly Clan. There were even people that publicly declared that they would back the Chu Heavenly Clan should the Li Heavenly Clan dare to start a war with them.<br>The talent that Chu Feng had displayed naturally served as one reason for the sudden change in their attitude. However, the main reason for their sudden change in behavior was Su Rou and Su Mei.<br>They would naturally want to gain some relationship with experts as powerful as the two of them. At that moment, the only possibly way for them to potentially have a relationship with those two experts would be through Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Originally, those people were all there for the Wuma Heavenly Clan and Wuma Shengjie.<br>For the sake of maintaining a friendly relationship with those people, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief even went out of his way to share such a rare Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant with them.<br>However, those people had now all surrounded the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. This caused the Wuma heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to feel very upset.<br>That said, although he felt very upset, there was nothing he could do about it.<br>Chu Feng was simply too dazzling. Before Chu Feng, regardless of whether it might be their clan&rsquo;s Wuma Shengjie or Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s disciples Liangqiu Hongyue and Liangqiu Lanyue, they were all much inferior by comparison.<br>On top of that, there were the two frightening existences of Su Rou and Su Mei.<br>Thus, with the current situation, even the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would have to maintain a friendly relationship with Chu Feng.<br>Suddenly, Liangqiu Chengfeng said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, there is one thing that this old man might be too bold to ask of you.&rdquo;<br>Liangqiu Chengfeng had actually been conversing with Chu Feng the entire time. However, after he said those words, the crowd present all stopped their discussions and turned their gazes to them.<br>They all felt that the situation seemed amiss. After all, Liangqiu Chengfeng&rsquo;s tone was excessively serious when he said those words.<br>They felt that Liangqiu Chengfeng must have something very important to ask Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, since you currently do not have a master in the field of world spirit techniques, are you willing to become my disciple?&rdquo; Liangqiu Chengfeng asked.<br></p></div>
