        <h1>Chapter 4009</h1>
        <div> - Chu Feng Vs. Liu Shuo<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Han Xiu opened her eyes.<br>The moment she opened her eyes, she was completely stunned.<br>A person stood before her.<br>&ldquo;Who is that guy?&rdquo;<br>Puzzled voices sounded from all around.<br>They did not recognize the person standing before Han Xiu.<br>If it were only a random stranger that had appeared, the crowd would not be so astonished. The reason for their astonishment was because that person not only stood before Han Xiu, but he had even intercepted the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster&rsquo;s martial power spear.<br>One must know that that martial power spear was powerful enough to kill Han Xiu.<br>Because of that, the crowd knew that, regardless of who that person might be, his strength was not to be underestimated.<br>As for the identity of that individual, he was naturally Chu Feng.<br>Merely, at that moment, Chu Feng had taken on the appearance of Asura.<br>When the crowd had seen Chu Feng earlier, he was in disguise as the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s disciple Wang Chen. As such, they failed to recognize him.<br>&ldquo;Asura?&rdquo;<br>Just when the crowd were confused, some people cried out in voices of alarm.<br>Those were experts from the All-heaven Sect. They had recognized Asura.<br>As for the other individual, she was Han Xiu.<br>Han Xiu had recognized who the person standing before her was from a single glance.<br>That was the reason why she was so astonished.<br>She was unable to understand why Asura would suddenly appear there.<br>More than that, she was unable to understand how he could intercept that martial power spear.<br>After all, Han Xiu knew very well that Asura was only a person of the younger generation.<br>&ldquo;Asura?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Asura?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He is the one who had disguised himself as the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s disciple Wang Chen and snatched away the treasures in the stone case world?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t that guy escape? Why would he return?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why did he rescue the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Most importantly, he actually managed to stop that martial power spear?&rdquo;<br>Upon learning that the mysterious person that had appeared was Asura, the surrounding crowd burst into a complete uproar.<br>They already knew that the person who'd been disguised as Wang Chen was not a member of the Mystic Cave Saints, but rather some fellow called Asura.<br>But, they had clearly witnessed Asura escaping earlier.<br>Thus, why would he return?<br>They were completely confused by his actions.<br>Most of all, they were astonished by his strength.<br>One should know that that martial power spear was capable of obliterating even rank three Utmost Exalteds.<br>Even if Asura was a genius world spiritist and could contend against rank two Utmost Exalteds with his Dragon Mark Saint-level spirit power, he should be completely powerless before that martial power spear.<br>&ldquo;Is it another treasure?&rdquo;<br>Finally, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster spoke.<br>He had noticed Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance the instant his martial power spear had been stopped.<br>Although he had a bone-deep hatred for Chu Feng, he did not rashly rush to attack him.<br>He had noticed a change to Chu Feng.<br>Even though he was able to clearly see him and recognize him as Asura right away, there was a visible change to him at that moment.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was emitting a golden gas.<br>That golden gas had completely covered Chu Feng, and had formed a new outline over his body.<br>It was as if there was another entity attached to him.<br>However, he was unable to detect the clear outline of the golden entity. All he could tell was that it seemed to be some sort of humanoid.<br>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s a treasure?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What sort of treasure is that? It&rsquo;s actually able to stop such a powerful martial power spear?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that mean that treasure has increased Asura&rsquo;s battle power to a level comparable to rank four Utmost Exalted?&rdquo;<br>The thought that it was a treasure had actually crossed the crowd&rsquo;s minds the instant they saw the golden gas that had covered Chu Feng. They were merely uncertain.<br>However, after hearing the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster's words, they had confirmed their guesses.<br>It was most definitely due to the golden gas that covered Asura's body that he was able to block the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster&rsquo;s martial power spear.<br>As for the golden gas, it was most definitely a special treasure.<br>Chu Feng completely ignored the crowd&rsquo;s reactions. He placed his palm onto Han Xiu&rsquo;s dantian.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>His spirit power surged forth and, like a gentle ray of light, began to flow into Han Xiu&rsquo;s dantian.<br>Once his spirit power entered her dantian, Han Xiu&rsquo;s expression immediately changed. Having her dantian destroyed, she was originally in miserable pain. However, not only was her pain decreasing at that moment, but even her cultivation that had been flowing out from her dantian found itself stuck, and unable to escape.<br>She looked at Chu Feng again. The shock in her eyes grew even more intense.<br>&ldquo;Asura, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>She had noticed that the spirit power Chu Feng had unleashed was that of a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please rest for the time being. I will help you soon.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng turned around and looked to the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster standing in the distance.<br>After turning around, he tightly grasped his palm, and a &lsquo;bang&rsquo; was heard. Martial power surged forth, and energy ripples began to wreak havoc.<br>He had crushed the martial power spear he had caught earlier.<br>Then, Chu Feng grasped his palm again, and a golden sword appeared in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Liu Shuo, do you think you&rsquo;re all that because you bully women?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, I, Asura, will be your opponent.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng suddenly disappeared. He had turned into a golden ray of light and shot straight at the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;Arrogant bastard, you truly do not know the immensity of heaven and earth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well. Today, I shall curb your heretical tricks.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the incoming Chu Feng, a look of ruthlessness appeared in the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Disregarding Zhao Hong, the grievance between him and Chu Feng had already reached a level of needing to settle their debts in blood.<br>Thus, even if Chu Feng hadn't attacked him, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster would definitely not have spared Chu Feng either.<br>As such, he pulled out his All-heaven Dragon Sword from Zhao Hong&rsquo;s body and rushed out to confront Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Clank, clank, clank, clank~~~&rdquo;<br>In the blink of an eye, the two men had collided in battle.<br>The two weapons criss-crossed with each other and sent forth violent ripples everywhere.<br>Their battle was actually even more terrifying than the earlier confrontation between Zhao Hong and the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>With the situation like that, the great majority of the people present were once again only able to feel the might of the battle, and were unable to see the details at all.<br>That said, the leaders of the five great powers were able to clearly see the ongoing battle.<br>It was precisely because of that that they were so astonished.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what power is that Asura using?&rdquo;<br>After observing the battle for some time, even they began to exclaim in admiration at whatever power Chu Feng was using.<br>In fact, there was a faint amount of unease present in their eyes.<br>One must know that the Incomplete Exalted Armament the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster was holding was renowned as the strongest Incomplete Exalted Armament in the entire All-heaven Starfield, the All-heaven Dragon Sword.<br>As for the weapon Chu Feng was holding, it was a random golden sword created by the golden gas that had enveloped his body.<br>Yet, that golden sword was not at all inferior in the battle against the All-heaven Dragon Sword.<br>But, if that were all, the five leaders would not be so astonished.<br>What brought them their astonishment was the fact that the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had been using his marital skills, secret skills and Immortal Techniques nonstop ever since the battle had begun.<br>In fact, he had even used some special treasures to increase his battle power.<br>Chu Feng, on the other hand, did not use any special abilities. He simply held onto the golden sword and fought using it.<br>Yet, even though that was the case, he was not at all disadvantaged in the battle.<br>Rather, he was gradually gaining the upper hand.<br>&ldquo;Could that Asura be a monster?&rdquo;<br>Seeing how Chu Feng was winning more and more as the battle progressed, the look of fear in the eyes of the five leaders grew more and more intense.<br></p></div>
