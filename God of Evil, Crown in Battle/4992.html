        <div>: Dote<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those words carried a menacing threat, but neither the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea was angered by those words. Instead, there were amiable smiles on their faces.<br>The person who had uttered the threat was none other than Song Yun.<br>&ldquo;Yun&rsquo;er, you&rsquo;re really fond of Chu Feng?&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother asked.<br>She had long noticed Song Yun&rsquo;s feelings for Chu Feng, and she had some understanding of Chu Feng too. It was just that the situation was a little complicated at the moment, so she needed to further clarify her daughter&rsquo;s stance.<br>&ldquo;Mother, I&rsquo;ve already told you clearly that I like him. When have I shown such fondness toward anyone else?&rdquo;<br>Song Yun raised her head, revealing her mischievous and adorable face. However, there was also a hint of haughtiness in her features too.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is indeed an extraordinary man. He was only at Utmost Exalted level the last time I met him, but he has already reached rank three Martial Exalted level and rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation. What&rsquo;s even more unbelievable is how he was able to make a breakthrough in the Monstrous King&rsquo;s Soul Mound.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s often said that those who manage to achieve greatness are those blessed with great luck. However, when the opportunity surfaced in the Monstrous King&rsquo;s Soul Mound, the only one who managed to grasp the opportunity was Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;The truth is that there are plenty of opportunities out there, but few know how to seize it. Chu Feng is the type of person who can make full use of every opportunity that comes his way. It may seem like he&rsquo;s blessed with great luck, but the truth is that his current level of cultivation was snatched over from the grasps of death each and every time.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt that he&rsquo;s a capable man. My daughter has a good eye for men. Given Chu Feng&rsquo;s talents, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before he surpasses me and becomes a powerhouse in the world of cultivation.<br>&ldquo;The only problem is that he&rsquo;s on good terms with Zi Ling, and you're planning to steal her soul power. Chu Feng won&rsquo;t turn a blind eye to it. Given his intelligence, he&rsquo;ll surely trace the matter to us no matter how discreet we pull it off. We&rsquo;re bound to offend Chu Feng here.<br>&ldquo;Yun&rsquo;er, you need to make a choice here. If you truly wish to obtain Zi Ling&rsquo;s soul power, you should allow me to deal with Chu Feng while I&rsquo;m still able to. Otherwise, you shouldn&rsquo;t even think about it. She&rsquo;s only obtained a small share of it anyway,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother said.<br>She rationally analyzed the situation for Song Yun with gentle words, trying to persuade her.<br>&ldquo;Mother, I&rsquo;ve already told you that I&rsquo;ll need every last bit of the soul power in order to achieve the effect I wish. It won&rsquo;t do even if I&rsquo;m lacking just a bit of it. The soul power has already started assimilating with her body, so we&rsquo;ll have to make haste.<br>&ldquo;I know that what I&rsquo;m doing will offend Chu Feng, but I have no other choice. The soul power is simply too important to me. I don&rsquo;t wish to offend Chu Feng either, but there&rsquo;s no way around it,&rdquo; Song Yun said.<br>&ldquo;If Yun&rsquo;er really requires the soul power, why don&rsquo;t you talk things over with Chu Feng? There&rsquo;s no need for you to become enemies?&rdquo;<br>said.<br>&ldquo;Aunt, I know Chu Feng better than you. There&rsquo;s no use negotiating with him. He won&rsquo;t remove the soul power from Zi Ling&rsquo;s body for my sake, especially if it&rsquo;ll inflict damage on Zi Ling. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about my relationship with Chu Feng. I have my own plans,&rdquo; Song Yun said.<br>She quickly added a moment later, &ldquo;Aunt, you shouldn&rsquo;t get involved in this matter. You should find an excuse and leave with big sister Lele and the others once you finish constructing the formation. Given Chu Feng&rsquo;s personality, he shouldn&rsquo;t blame the matter on you as long as you didn&rsquo;t get involved in it. You&rsquo;ll still be able to maintain your ties with him.<br>&ldquo;However, I ought to remind you that no matter how much you like Yaoyao and want to keep her by your side, you can&rsquo;t make a move on Chu Feng. If you harm him, I swear that I&rsquo;ll kill Yaoyao and you.&rdquo;<br>There was a smile on Song Yun&rsquo;s face when she said those words, making it seem as if she was kidding. However, both the Godwish Grandmother and<br>were aware that Song Yun meant what she said.<br>As a result, the Godwish Grandmother put on a stern face.<br>&ldquo;Yun&rsquo;er, watch your tone. How can you speak to your aunt like this?&rdquo;<br>The Godwish Grandmother was angered by Song Yun&rsquo;s rudeness. She rarely lost her temper at Song Yun, but she couldn&rsquo;t overlook anyone behaving so rudely to<br>. The latter wasn&rsquo;t just her junior but her younger sister too.<br>They were each other&rsquo;s only blood kin in this world.<br>&ldquo;Mother, I&rsquo;m just joking, though I guess jokes sometimes become true. I&rsquo;m quite a hot-headed person, and you know that too. That&rsquo;s why, aunt, you should heed my words,&rdquo; Song Yun replied cheerily.<br>&ldquo;To be honest with you, Yun&rsquo;er, I&rsquo;d have probably eliminated him out of my own selfish motives if it had been anyone else, but I won&rsquo;t do it because he&rsquo;s Chu Feng. There&rsquo;s one thing that I need to tell the two of you.<br>&ldquo;My Spirit Rock of Prophecies once prophesied that the Nine Souls Galaxy would face a huge calamity, and the only one who could stop it is Chu Feng. Getting rid of Chu Feng right now would mean leaving the future of the Nine Souls Galaxy in shambles. I don&rsquo;t care whether you&rsquo;re going to turn your back on Chu Feng or not, but you can be certain that I won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo;<br>said.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about whatever calamity you&rsquo;re talking about. All that matters is that Chu Feng is safe and sound. Alright, I should return and make preparations. I&rsquo;ll leave this place to you, mother and aunt.&rdquo;<br>With those words, Song Yun took her leave.<br>&ldquo;Little sister, I&rsquo;m sorry. I was too easy on Yun&rsquo;er, and I ended up spoiling her. Don&rsquo;t think too much about it. Yun&rsquo;er isn&rsquo;t a bad person,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother said.<br>&ldquo;Yun&rsquo;er is indeed highly talented, just as you&rsquo;ve said. It&rsquo;s no wonder why you cherish her so much. I wasn't even aware that you had a daughter. However, Yun&rsquo;er seems to have quite a peculiar personality. Big sister, I know that Yun&rsquo;er is your daughter, but are you sure that you&rsquo;ll be able to keep her in line? Have you considered the possibility that she might go on a rampage one day?&rdquo;<br>asked worriedly.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Yun&rsquo;er won&rsquo;t lose control of herself. I know that I dote on Yun&rsquo;er, but that&rsquo;s because I feel indebted to her. I was too absorbed into furthering my cultivation back then that I kept suppressing Yun&rsquo;er development in my womb. During that period of time, I stumbled into a demonic ancient remnant and accidentally got afflicted with demonic aura, causing my body to lose control. In the end, I was forced to give birth to Yun&rsquo;er in the City of Demons.<br>&ldquo;Due to my carelessness, Yun&rsquo;er was already suffused with demonic aura even from her moment of birth. She was doomed to live a short life with a high concentration of demonic aura within her, but I chose to tackle poison with poison and had her absorb the demonic aura from demonic tools to sustain her life.<br>&ldquo;I know that Yun&rsquo;er has an extreme personality, but she isn&rsquo;t an evil person at heart. It&rsquo;s already a blessing that she has her current personality. I believe that I&rsquo;ll eventually be able to cure her. Once that happens, her personality should improve for the better,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother said with guilt-ridden eyes.<br>&ldquo;But most demonic tools are a cultivator&rsquo;s prized possession. You must have sinned a lot for this child,&rdquo;<br>said.<br>The Godwish Grandmother&rsquo;s face stiffened. She looked conflicted for a moment, but she soon broke out in a smile. It was as if she didn&rsquo;t regret her actions at all.<br>&ldquo;Little sister, you won&rsquo;t understand because you don&rsquo;t have a child. My initial plan for having this child was to boost my cultivation. That was why I simply found a man who fit my criteria to bear Yun&rsquo;er. However, the moment she was born, I suddenly realized just how important she is to me. She isn&rsquo;t just a continuation of my life. She&rsquo;s the person whom I wish to protect the most.<br>&ldquo;As long as she can grow up safely, I&rsquo;m willing to do anything at all.<br>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t deny that I flouted our master&rsquo;s teaching and have committed many sins for Yun&rsquo;er, but I have done many good deeds in compensation too,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother said with a sigh.<br>&ldquo;Humans are all selfish. I have done many wrongs myself too, so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m qualified to preach either. Big sis, you should remember that you&rsquo;re the person closest to me in the world. If you ever need help, I&rsquo;ll rush over right away. I&rsquo;m willing to turn against the entire world for your sake,&rdquo;<br>said.<br>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;<br>The two of them exchanged warm smiles.<br>&ldquo;How disgusting. Two shameless old hags trying to act as loving sisters,&rdquo; an infuriated voice suddenly boomed.<br>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come out!&rdquo;<br>The Godwish Grandmother and<br>eyed the surroundings warily. They had set up a barrier around here beforehand, such that no one other than Song Yun should have been able to enter the premises.<br>Yet, someone appeared to have overheard their conversation.<br>&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo;<br>With a cold harrumph, two silhouettes came into appearance. They were none other than Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian.<br>Shengguang Baimei had an angry look on his face, and Daoist Niantian looked livid too. They were looking at the Godwish Grandmother with eyes filled with hostility.<br>They were worried that the Godwish Grandmother and<br>would tamper with the formation, so they secretly kept an eye on them from the shadows. Yet, who could have thought that they were scheming to harm Zi Ling?<br>Shengguang Baimei couldn&rsquo;t tolerate this outrageous nonsense.<br></p></div>
