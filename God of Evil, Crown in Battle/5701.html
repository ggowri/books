        <h1>Chapter 5701: Revelation of the Rankings, the World in Shock</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a desert in one of the Seven Realms Galaxy&rsquo;s Ordinary Realm, two beautiful women suddenly emerged from beneath the sand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them wore a blue dress and gave off a cold atmosphere. The other one looked adorable in her white dress with a little wind chime hanging from her waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither of these two women was to be trifled with. The woman in the blue dress was Li Wu, the person whom Bai </span><span>Yunqing</span><span> adored, but she had another identity&mdash;the Black-feathered Specter possessing the power of curses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the woman in a white dress, she was a talented junior from the Bloodline Galaxy, and she was once invited to participate in the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith. Long Chengyu had once followed her, and it was in the process of doing so that he became acquainted with Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Our gains are not bad this time. It looks like the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion isn&rsquo;t that impressive, after all. They didn&rsquo;t even know that there was such a treasure hidden in their domain. We got it good,&rdquo; Feng Ling said with a gloating smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How formidable can the world spiritists of the present era be? The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is just for show,&rdquo; Li Wu replied in disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Big sister, where should we head next?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We should find somewhere peaceful to assimilate what we have gained from the ancient tomb,&rdquo; Li Wu replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in no rush, right? I want to try some of the local delicacies,&rdquo; Feng Ling tugged </span><span>Li Wu&rsquo;s arms and coyly shook it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Li Wu initially frowned, but she quickly shook her head and replied with a beautiful smile, &ldquo;Fine, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two sisters quickly left the desert and made their way into a city, where they headed to one of the more famous restaurants. The restaurant&rsquo;s business was excellent; many cultivators and world spiritists were gathered in it. None of them were particularly strong, but all of them were talking about two matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was regarding the Totem Dragon Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other was regarding Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither Feng Ling nor Li Wu was concerned about the Totem Dragon Clan, but Chu Feng&rsquo;s name caught Feng Ling&rsquo;s interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is this the Chu Feng you&rsquo;re talking about?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked as she took out a portrait of Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! It&rsquo;s that Chu Feng,&rdquo; the person being questioned replied with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How do you know Chu Feng is dead?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young miss, even though Chu Feng hogged the limelight that day, there&rsquo;s no way he could have survived after channeling such a powerful formation. The formation was from the World Spiritist Immortal King, and it granted him the power to rival the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master. No matter how formidable he is, there&rsquo;s no way he could survive the backlash!&rdquo; the person said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the restaurant voiced their agreement. It was a common consensus that Chu Feng was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hmph&hellip;&rdquo; Feng Ling sneered. &ldquo;You only think so because you don&rsquo;t know Chu Feng. He must be alive.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;s still alive,&rdquo; a grudging voice echoed from the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feng Ling looked over and saw three people sitting at the corner. Their appearances were obscured by a gray cloak, but the one who spoke sounded like a young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How do you know Chu Feng isn&rsquo;t alive?&rdquo; Feng Ling questioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I just know it.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three people stood up and took off their gray cloaks. The crowd was horrified to see them. Every single person in the restaurant, be it guests or staff members, escaped right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These three people were from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could the crowd dare to stay after gossiping about the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion in front of their people?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a matter of moments, the only ones left in the restaurant were Feng Ling, Li Wu, and the trio from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. No wonder you&rsquo;re insisting that Chu Feng is dead. It wouldn&rsquo;t reflect well on you if he&rsquo;s still alive, right?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked with a chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your relationship with Chu Feng? Why are you speaking up for him?&rdquo; the young man asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What is my relationship with him? We&rsquo;re friends,&rdquo; Feng Ling replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Friends?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion were taken aback. Never in their wildest imagination did they think that anyone would admit to being Chu Feng&rsquo;s friend in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I have seen many dumb people, but it&rsquo;s my first time seeing someone as dumb as you. Do you really not fear death?&rdquo; the young man asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Of course</span><span> I do,&rdquo; Feng Ling replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yet you dare claim to be Chu Feng&rsquo;s friend?&rdquo; The young man was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Feng Ling asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Killing intent flashed across the eyes of those from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feng Ling was clearly challenging the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s authority here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then that an explosion echoed from the sky. In the flash of an eye, the clear sky was suddenly plunged into darkness. The cultivators panicked at this abrupt phenomenon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, this phenomenon didn&rsquo;t last too long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A ray of light suddenly appeared in the sky. To be exact, this ray of light was extremely far away from them, but the crowd could still clearly see it because of how shockingly big it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is that a scroll?&rdquo; someone in the crowd murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Heavens Ranking,&rdquo; someone from the older generation blurted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Heavens Ranking?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that the crowd understood what was going on. It went without saying that they had heard about Heavens Ranking&mdash;it was a powerful formation from the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith that encompassed the entire world of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was similar to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Seven Realms Edict, but it was much stronger and majestic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Does the revelation of the Heavens Ranking mean that the result of the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith is out?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd&rsquo;s interest was piqued. They had known that the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith had invited </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span>, Long Chengyu, Ling Xiao, Qin Xuan, and the others, but there was no follow up on that matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought that the Heavens Ranking had appeared to announce the result, and they were curious to know who the strongest junior in the world of cultivation was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scroll of Heavens Ranking slowly unfurled like a beautiful painting in the pitch-black world. The two words inscribed in the middle of the scroll, &lsquo;Heavens Ranking&rsquo;, ascertained its identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Words were revealed on the scroll, informing the crowd about the true reason behind the appearance of the Heavens Ranking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that the previous Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith had been postponed, as the formation had detected outstanding juniors who weren't invited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith would be held two months from now. Unlike before, all juniors beneath a hundred years of age in the world of cultivation were allowed to </span><span>participate. It would be held in the </span><span>Blazepulse</span><span> </span><span>Starfield&rsquo;s</span><span> </span><span>Blazepulse</span><span> Ordinary Realm of the Bloodline Galaxy. A formation would appear in </span><span>Blazepulse</span><span> Village, and those who cleared the formation would be qualified to join the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith and compete with other prodigies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;They are using the Heavens Ranking to invite prodigies to the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith? This had never happened before, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Powerhouses from different realms were stunned by the phenomenon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heavens Ranking was a mind-bogglingly large formation spanning the world of cultivation, usually reserved for the announcement of the outcome of the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith. Invitations were usually done via personal letters instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time in history that the Heavens Ranking was used as an invitation letter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;As expected of God&rsquo;s Era!&rdquo; the powerhouses remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More words appeared on the Heavens Ranking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith is open to all juniors this time around, but there are eight juniors who deserve special invitations. They are allowed to enter the Nine Heavens Zenith without having to challenge the formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone&rsquo;s eyes were fixated on the Heavens Ranking when those words appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had their guesses, but they still wanted to know who were the eight people invited via Heavens Ranking. More words appeared on the Heavens Ranking, revealing the name list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heavenly Dome Galaxy: Qin Xuan</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bloodline Galaxy: Feng Ling</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Totem Galaxy: Long Chengyu</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immortal Sea Galaxy. </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ancestral Martial Galaxy: Chu Feng</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nine Souls Galaxy: Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seven Realms Galaxy: Jie Tian</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Body Galaxy: Wang Qiang</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was taken aback.</span></p></div>
