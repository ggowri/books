        <h1>Chapter 4249</h1>
        <div> - Experts Assembled<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grandmaster Tang Chen did not make things difficult for Lu Jie and the others; he allowed them to leave.<br>No matter what, Grandmaster Tang Chen would have to give the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted face.<br>Suddenly, an old man&rsquo;s voice sounded, &ldquo;You actually dared cross the disciples of the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tang Chen, it would appear that you have quite an extraordinary relationship with this child.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that he&rsquo;s actually your disciple?&rdquo;<br>Looking toward the voice, a fluffy-haired old man could be seen standing in the sky far away.<br>His hair resembled a lion's mane, but his stature was extremely short and small.<br>That old man was actually only a meter tall. It would not be inaccurate to say that he was a midget.<br>In addition to being short and small, he was also incomparably ugly. He had a garlic-like nose, his face was covered in wrinkles, and his skin was extremely rough.<br>Speaking honestly, even flies wouldn't dare land on his face for fear that they&rsquo;d sprain their legs.<br>But, no one dared scorn that ugly old man.<br>The reason for that was because he had a grand origin.<br>He was known as Grandmaster Luo Tuo. [1. Luo means mule, Tuo means camel]<br>That Grandmaster Luo Tuo was not only a Martial Exalted-level expert, he was also a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist that had comprehended rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>He was an existence on par with Grandmaster Tang Chen in all aspects.<br>After Grandmaster Luo Tuo spoke, and before Grandmaster Tang Chen could answer, a female voice sounded.<br>&ldquo;That Lu Jie issued a challenge to Chu Feng. After being defeated, his senior brother appeared intending to kill him. Such behavior is beyond acting like sore losers. They are simply taking advantage of their position to bully others. They are an utter disgrace to us world spiritists, an utter disgrace to the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if it&rsquo;s the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, he wouldn&rsquo;t possibly defend them after hearing of their wrongdoings in full, no?&rdquo;<br>The woman who had spoken wore a red dress. Colored ribbons fluttered on her dress. Adding on the fact that the woman was pretty to begin with, she resembled a celestial fairy or a beauty from a painting as she stood in the air.<br>Although she resembled a celestial fairy, very few people would be tempted by her beauty.<br>The reason for that was because the majority of the crowd present knew who she was.<br>Her name was Wang Muzhi, and she called herself, Celestial Fairy Muzhi.<br>But, everyone knew that the so-called Celestial Fairy Muzhi was actually an old monster that had lived for over ten thousand years.<br>Her appearance was a total disguise through the use of world spirit techniques.<br>After all, even in the martial cultivation world, at an age of over ten thousand, one would look extremely old.<br>If she didn&rsquo;t deliberately disguise herself, her appearance would be that of an old granny with a face filled with wrinkles. How could she possibly look beautiful?<br>That said, Celestial Fairy Muzhi also possessed the cultivation of Martial Exalted, and rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>She was also an existence with strength on par with Grandmaster Tang Chen and Grandmaster Luo Tuo.<br>After seeing the appearance of Grandmaster Luo Tuo and Celestial Fairy Muzhi, none of the bystanders dared act carelessly. But, they weren't also overly surprised.<br>It came as no surprise that grand existences like them would be present during such a grand occasion.<br>The crowd&rsquo;s eyes were still fixed on Chu Feng. His earlier performance had been simply too stunning.<br>The crowd was still immersed in shock.<br>They were still thinking of what sort of accomplishments a genius like him would attain in the future.<br>After all, since the time of the Ancient Era, no such genius world spiritist had emerged in the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>&ldquo;This old man is not interested in whether or not the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted will try to make things difficult for Tang Chen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m interested in is exactly whose disciple this Chu Feng is,&rdquo; Grandmaster Luo Tuo said as he inspected Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s most definitely not Tang Chen&rsquo;s disciple. If he were Tang Chen&rsquo;s disciple, Tang Chen would&rsquo;ve been bragging about him already.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could he hold himself back for so long?&rdquo; Celestial Fairy Muzhi said with a smile.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen was left speechless after hearing those words.<br>What the Celestial Fairy Muzhi had said was true. If Chu Feng was his disciple, he wouldn&rsquo;t bother hiding the fact at all. Instead, he would&rsquo;ve informed the entire Holy Light Galaxy already.<br>After all, being able to produce a disciple of such caliber would be glorious to anyone.<br>Unfortunately, Chu Feng was not his disciple.<br>Thinking of this, Grandmaster Tang Chen couldn&rsquo;t help but feel envious of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Say, young friend Chu Feng, exactly whose disciple are you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell big sister?&rdquo;<br>Celestial Fairy Muzhi arrived before Chu Feng.<br>Even though she was already an old monster who was over ten thousand years old, she still acted like she was very young. Not only did she address herself as &lsquo;big sister,&rsquo; she even winked flirtatiously at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a master. Thus, I am no one&rsquo;s disciple,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No master?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words caused everyone&rsquo;s expressions to change.<br>How could a heaven-defying demon-level genius like Chu Feng have no master?<br>Could it be that he was a self-made genius?<br>The crowd simply could not believe that there could be such a thing.<br>It was not only the others; even Grandmaster Tang Chen was surprised.<br>After all, he knew very well that Chu Feng&rsquo;s master was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, who had once been the strongest world spiritist in the Holy Light Galaxy, Zhuge Yuankong.<br>What he didn&rsquo;t know was that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist taking Chu Feng as his disciple was merely a one-sided affair.<br>Whilst Chu Feng was grateful for the aid that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had provided him, and greatly respected him as a senior, Chu Feng had never agreed to become the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s disciple.<br>Even when he'd gone to challenge Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s spirit formation, it was merely to repay the Ox-nosed Old Daoist for all his help.<br>That said, Grandmaster Tang Chen did not overthink things.<br>He felt that Chu Feng&rsquo;s refusal to admit that he had a master was most likely out of consideration for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>After all, they still could not expose the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s true identity yet. It would only invite trouble.<br>Not only would it stir up danger for Zhuge Yuankong, it would also cause Chu Feng himself to fall into great danger.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re actually refusing to tell the truth?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that this young friend&rsquo;s master is someone who&rsquo;s too ashamed to reveal themselves.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, another voice sounded. It had come from a tall man wearing an exquisite gown.<br>Although his attire was very exquisite, his complexion was deathly pale. He looked as if he had covered his face in a thick layer of powder. But, that wasn&rsquo;t the case at all. That was his natural complexion.<br>From a glance, he resembled a ghost. It was truly quite terrifying.<br>Furthermore, he had a pointy mouth and face ridges resembling that of a monkey. One could tell from a glance that he wasn&rsquo;t someone good.<br>Even though he was dressed in grand attire, his outfit was unable to conceal his ruthlessness and cunning.<br>Not only that, he also gave off a very feminine air.<br>Even though he was a man, his every movement was filled with femininity. Even his voice sounded almost like a woman&rsquo;s voice.<br>In his hand was a black fan. As he moved the fan, he appeared even more feminine.<br>That old man was known as the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.<br>He was also an existence on par with Grandmaster Tang Chen, Grandmaster Luo Tuo and Celestial Fairy Muzhi.<br>Ignoring the strongest world spiritist from the Holy Light Clan, the four of them would be the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s four strongest world spiritists, weaker than only the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all here. Apart from the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, practically all the strongest world spiritists of the Holy Light Galaxy have appeared.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I wonder who will be able to obtain the inheritance of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain?&rdquo;<br>After the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted appeared, many people began gasping in admiration.<br>Judging from the time, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain was about to open.<br>The true show was about to start.<br>However, after the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted appeared, Grandmaster Tang Chen did not gasp in admiration like the others. Instead, his complexion grew gloomy.<br>It turned out that there were two other people behind the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.<br>They were none other than the Revered Master Beast Tamer and Li Fengxue.<br>That master and disciple had plotted against Chu Feng back then and nearly killed him.<br>&ldquo;Beast Tamer, you&rsquo;re finally showing yourself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We should settle the debt from back then.&rdquo;<br>Once Grandmaster Tang Chen finished saying those words, his clothes started fluttering and the surrounding weather changed.<br>The power he had unleashed immediately engulfed the entire region.<br>It was oppressive might, the oppressive might of a Martial Exalted!<br>Although his oppressive might wasn't aimed at Chu Feng, he was still able to sense how powerful it was.<br>&ldquo;So this is the power above Utmost Exalted.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes shone upon sensing the oppressive might of a Martial Exalted. He began to think deeply.<br>Even though he was now an Utmost Exalted and his cultivation could be said to be very outstanding among the people of the younger generation, he would still be akin to an ant when facing an existence like Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>Using only their oppressive might or a single thought, they would be able to utterly annihilate him.<br></p></div>
