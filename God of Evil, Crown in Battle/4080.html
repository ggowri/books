        <h1>Chapter 4079</h1>
        <div> - You All Are Not Qualified<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Hanpeng told Chu Feng everything in detail.<br>He told Chu Feng that the Purple Star Hall forced them to enter the Purple Star Variance Realm.<br>Originally, everyone felt that the opportunity to enter the Purple Star Variance Realm was a good thing. However, after being forced to do so, they realized that things were not that simple.<br>In the beginning, even the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had felt nervous.<br>Ignoring the fact that the Star-guiding Stone would lure the Purple Star Variance Beasts to them, merely the fact that the Xuanming Family might seek them out to cause trouble in the Purple Star Variance Realm was already enough of an ordeal for them to handle.<br>Because of this, when the other powers were all approaching the depths of the Purple Star Variance Realm to obtain the rank three Exalted Taboo and find the legendary cultivation treasure, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had led the Chu Heavenly Clansmen to linger at the fringes of the Purple Star Variance Realm.<br>He'd done that so that they could avoid dangers.<br>All ten powers were followed by an elder from the Purple Star Hall.<br>Seeing that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was actually unwilling to go deeper into the Purple Star Variance Realm, and was instead lingering around the fringe, the place with the weakest amount of natural energies, the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s elder was furious.<br>That elder had even forced the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to proceed into the depths of the Purple Star Variance Realm.<br>For the sake of preventing his clansmen from suffering a calamity, the honest Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was forced to use a bribe.<br>He took out the several most precious treasures Chu Feng had obtained from the Xuanming Family and gave them to that Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s elder.<br>After receiving such benefits, even though the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s elder was still snorting his nose at the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s escapist behavior, he no longer forced the Chu Heavenly Clan to proceed into the depths of the Purple Star Variance Realm.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had thought that the Chu Heavenly Clan would be able to escape a calamity.<br>However, no one would&rsquo;ve expected that the Chu Heavenly Clan that was lingering around the fringes of the Purple Star Variance Realm would actually discover an abnormal sign.<br>The abnormal sign was a lump of extremely concentrated and boundless natural energies.<br>When the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief approached the abnormal sign, his Star-guiding Stone immediately took effect, and absorbed the natural energies.<br>But, because the amount of natural energies was simply too boundless, the absorption process made the abnormal sign even fiercer, and it ended up spreading throughout half of the entire Purple Star Variance Realm.<br>With an abnormal sign covering the sky, people would inevitably take note.<br>Because of that, a calamity was lured over.<br>Other powers arrived. They not only snatched away the Star-guiding Stone that had absorbed the abnormal sign, but they had also seriously injured the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Lord Clan Chief?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Where is he right now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Quickly bring me to him,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Chu Hanpeng did not hesitate either. He brought Chu Feng to where the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was recuperating.<br>A palace hall. The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s upper echelons were all gathered there.<br>In the center of the palace hall was an active healing formation.<br>Chu Feng could see the condition of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief inside the healing formation.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was not only on the verge of death, but his appearance was also tragic.<br>Even though the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s experts had all tried their hardest to treat his injuries over the past few days, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was still covered in wounds that rendered him beyond recognition.<br>That was not all; his internal injuries were even more serious than his physical injuries.<br>His bones were all shattered, and his veins had all been snapped. Furthermore, his soul had suffered as many injuries as his physical body.<br>It was precisely the injuries to his soul that caused the many experts of the Chu Heavenly Clan to be unable to even heal the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s physical injuries.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief entered the Purple Star Variance Realm for the sake of helping the Purple Star Hall. With how seriously injured he is, why didn&rsquo;t the Purple Star Hall dispatch people to treat his injuries?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I actually went to seek out the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s help, but they said that they won&rsquo;t meddle in personal grudges,&rdquo; said Chu Hanpeng.<br>&ldquo;Not meddle in personal grudges?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng gnashed his teeth with extreme anger.<br>The way he saw it, the Purple Star Hall was obviously leaving them to die.<br>That said, Chu Feng was not immersed in excessive hatred.<br>Instead, he immediately began to set up a spirit formation to treat the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s injuries.<br>Receiving treatment from Chu Feng&rsquo;s grand formation, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s body began to heal.<br>Even his aura was no longer as weak as before.<br>Seeing their Lord Clan Chief being pulled from the gates of hell by Chu Feng, Chu Hanpeng and the other experts from the Chu Heavenly Clan all teared up emotionally.<br>They&rsquo;d been extremely worried all these days. They were very afraid that their Lord Clan Chief would end up dying.<br>At that moment, whilst their Lord Clan Chief was still unconscious, they were able to see that his life was no longer in danger.<br>This eased their worries, and allowed them to release all of their feelings of grievance.<br>Because of that, sounds of weeping filled the entire palace hall.<br>&ldquo;What use is there in crying? Is crying capable of solving problems?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng stood up and swept his gaze over the crowd.<br>Even though the people there were all his seniors, Chu Feng was looking at them with a look of disappointment.<br>The majority of the people in the world were people that bullied the weak and feared the strong. Those seniors of his were the same.<br>However, even though Chu Feng was a junior, not only did his criticism of his seniors not receive any rebuttal, instead their bodies trembled in fear. Then, they began to silently wipe away their tears.<br>Things were very different now. Chu Feng was no longer the discarded child that everyone wanted to beat up. Instead, he had become their pillar of support. This held true even for their Lord Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, earlier, you were being secretive and unwilling to tell me who it was that injured Lord Clan Chief like this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you planning to continue to conceal this or are you going to tell me who they are now?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng turned his gaze to Chu Hanpeng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m not doing this because I want to protect that power. It&rsquo;s because I want to protect you,&rdquo; said Chu Hanpeng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what Lord Supreme Elder says is correct. We aren&rsquo;t concealing this matter deliberately. We truly want to protect you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are no match for that power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Chu Feng, you must not act recklessly. You are our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s hope now. What are we to do if something is to happen to you?&rdquo;<br>The other elders present also spoke out.<br>Their standpoints were unanimous. None of them wanted Chu Feng to seek revenge.<br>&ldquo;Protect me?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the way his seniors were acting, Chu Feng let out a cold laugh.<br>&ldquo;When I was deemed to be trash incapable of cultivation and abandoned by my clan, why weren&rsquo;t you all protecting me then?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were all shocked and were left completely speechless. They all stood there completely stunned.<br>&ldquo;When I was being bullied in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm and even the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, why didn&rsquo;t you all protect me then?&rdquo; Chu Feng continued.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clansmen revealed looks of shame. They all lowered their heads silently.<br>&ldquo;Actually, it&rsquo;s not that there&rsquo;s never been anyone in the Chu Heavenly Clan that protected me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, of those people that stood before me and shielded me behind them, I don&rsquo;t seem to recall any of the seniors here being among them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I had to rely on you all to protect me, who knows how many times I would&rsquo;ve died by now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet now, you all are telling me you&rsquo;re trying to protect me?&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke up to this point, his sneer grew even more pronounced.<br>As for those Chu Heavenly Clansmen, their faces had turned deathly pale. It was no longer only looks of shame that covered their faces. Fear was also present on their faces.<br>&ldquo;I will ask everyone here a question.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As members of the Chu Heavenly Clan, after our Lord Clan Chief was being seriously injured, did any of you attempt to seek out that power for revenge?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked all of a sudden.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s not that we do not want revenge. It&rsquo;s simply that even if we had sought them for revenge, we&rsquo;d only be throwing away our lives in vain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. To set ourselves against a power so much more powerful than ourselves is simply courting death.&rdquo;<br>Finally, those Chu Heavenly Clansmen spoke again.<br>Their words indirectly answered his question.<br>After their Lord Clan Chief had been seriously injured and nearly killed, none of them attempted to seek revenge. In fact, the thought of revenge had never even crossed their minds.<br>&ldquo;Why bother saying things in such a roundabout and refined manner? It would do to just say that you all are afraid of death,&rdquo; sneered Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;We&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clansmen were left speechless.<br>The anger present on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face grew more and more intense.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing for you all to not fight back. Yet, you&rsquo;re actually concealing their identity from me and refusing to allow me to take revenge? Furthermore, you use the excuse of protecting me as your justification?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The truth is, you all are afraid that I will cause trouble for you after finding those people for revenge, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ask yourselves this. Are you doing this to protect me, or are you doing this to protect yourselves?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng continued to question them. His tone grew more and more fierce.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how can you say that? We are your seniors,&rdquo; finally, someone was unable to tolerate Chu Feng anymore, and actually refuted him.<br>&ldquo;Senior? Well spoken.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Well then, senior, I ask you this, why weren&rsquo;t you there to raise me, nurture me and protect me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tell me, why weren&rsquo;t you there?!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng asked sternly.<br>That man didn&rsquo;t know how to answer Chu Feng. He was so scared that his morale dropped completely, and cold sweat flowed steadily down his face.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t feel the slightest bit of pity or guilt.<br>He knew that it was bad for him to speak to his seniors in such a manner. But, even if it was wrong, he still had to do it.<br>When he'd returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan, countless Chu Heavenly Clansmen were against him. Only a small portion of Chu Heavenly Clansmen had stood on his side. Among them, it was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief that was able to truly protect him.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, he would&rsquo;ve been killed by his own clansmen.<br>Thus, to Chu Feng, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was an extremely important person.<br>He was someone that he truly considered to be a relative.<br>He was a person Chu Feng really wanted to protect.<br>For someone to dare touch him, Chu Feng was determined to make them pay regardless of who they were.<br>Yet, those people actually chose to tolerate such things after their Lord Clan Chief had been seriously injured. How could Chu Feng possibly restrain himself?!<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng pointed his finger to the crowd present and spoke sternly, &ldquo;Listen carefully. All the things that I, Chu Feng, have done for the Chu Heavenly Clan are not for you. Instead, it&rsquo;s for the people that considered me to be their relative.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, have always been a person who will only treat people who cared for me well. As for you all&hellip; you merely enjoyed their light.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng spoke with a grave expression and a shocking voice that caused even the palace hall itself to tremble.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s seniors were also trembling.<br>They were able to tell that Chu Feng was truly angered.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng kicked open the entrance.<br>He intended to leave. However, before walking out the doorway, he stopped and turned around.<br>&ldquo;Even without you all telling me who did it, I can find out myself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You all should be able to guess what I&rsquo;m planning to do.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re afraid, then leave now&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Leave this place. Leave the Chu Heavenly Clan. Leave the martial cultivation world&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For you might not be qualified to remain as martial cultivators, much less members of the Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
