        <h1>Chapter 5509: What Kind of Darned Place is This</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, are you willing to show yourself?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>There was no response.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What did you hear, Chu Feng?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I heard someone telling me that my friends will be in danger,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is that referring to Long Chengyu and Long Muxi?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the point of saying such words to you? It&rsquo;s not as if you&rsquo;re able to enter the gate.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let me take a look. There should be another way in.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng took a step back to examine the barrier blocking his way once more, but it was futile. Before he knew it, he had started to get a little anxious. The warning from the earlier voice had stoked his worries.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you really wish to save them?&rdquo; the voice suddenly spoke up once more.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, elder. I wish to save them,&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly replied.</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>The space beside Chu Feng distorted, and a spirit formation gate manifested into sight.</span><br><span>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re certain about it, step into the spirit formation gate and undergo the tempering,&rdquo; that voice said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, why did that gate suddenly appear? What did that person tell you?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>She couldn&rsquo;t hear the voice, but she could deduce that the spirit formation gate that had appeared out of nowhere had something to do with the voice Chu Feng spoke about.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He told me to step in and undergo the tempering,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that person?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, can you show yourself for a conversation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked once more.</span><br><span>There was no response.</span><br><span>Knowing that there was no other option, Chu Feng stepped into the spirit formation gate and found himself standing in the middle of the wilderness. To his surprise, he couldn&rsquo;t sense any tempering energy at all; it was as if he was truly in the middle of the wilderness.</span><br><span>He subconsciously thought that he had to find the tempering energy here himself, but just as he was about to move, the ground suddenly quaked.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>The quaking grew more and more intense with time. At the same time, an intense blood stench wafted across the air. Soon, a gigantic tsunami appeared from the distance and swiftly gushed toward Chu Feng with astonishing speed.</span><br><span>It was a blood tsunami, not just because its color resembled blood but because the fluid was blood itself. Towering over a thousand meters tall, it emanated strong pressure on those standing before it. Within an instant, Chu Feng was already swept away by it.</span><br><span>Chu Feng scanned his surroundings once more and saw everything was submerged under the blood tsunami. It was almost as if he was deep under a blood ocean.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you all right, Chu Feng? How are you feeling?&rdquo; Eggy asked worriedly.</span><br><span>The blood tsunami was so frightening that she was worried for Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Eggy. I don&rsquo;t feel anything at all,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t feel anything at all?&rdquo; Eggy was taken aback. With the frightening momentum of the blood tsunami, she thought that it would be an excruciating tempering process.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t feel anything at all,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is this really a tempering process then?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. Let&rsquo;s wait and see how it goes,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>He could feel the sensation of blood pressing against his skin, but there was no pain at all. It felt like diving in an ocean, just that he was surrounded not by water but blood. He thought that this might just be the start of the tempering process, but nothing happened even after he waited for some time.</span><br><span>Eventually, the spirit formation gate he had entered this place by exerted a strong suction force that dragged him out. As soon as he was pulled out, the spirit formation gate vanished.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Is that all?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That seems to be so.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng inspected his body and saw that there was still blood dripping from him. He </span><span>didn&rsquo;t sense any changes in his body, though there was an awful stench on him that smelled not just of blood but decaying corpses as well. It was so pungent that even Chu Feng found it hard to bear, but he didn&rsquo;t immediately wash it off him.</span><br><span>He had a feeling that this stench might actually be the purpose of the tempering.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Forget it, let me give it a try.</span><br><span>Chu Feng made his way toward the barrier once more. There was still a strong force pushing against him, but it no longer felt as solid as a metal wall. He could finally enter the barrier now, though there was an extreme resistance force pushing him back.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you able to pass through the barrier now?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible now, but it&rsquo;ll be a bit hard. I don&rsquo;t think Long Chengyu and the others faced so much resistance from the barrier earlier,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>Chu Feng still gritted his teeth and pushed on, but it was simply too difficult. Even though Long Chengyu and the others had struggled earlier, the resistance they had to overcome was at least a hundred times lower than what he was undergoing now.</span><br><span>This was even more difficult for Chu Feng to bear.</span><br><span>It didn&rsquo;t take long for him to be soaked and dripping with sweat, but he persevered.</span><br><span>Still, he had underestimated the resistance. It was initially just a burden on his body, but it eventually extended to his soul as well. His patience slowly wore thin as a feeling of frustration overwhelmed his mind. There was a strong urge to give up, to the point where it was driving him insane.</span><br><span>Yet, he gritted his teeth and pushed on.</span><br><span>He felt that there was credence to the reminder he had received and that Long Chengyu and Long Muxi were really in danger. He had to enter the gate, even if there was a restriction in place that rejected his presence.</span><br><span>It was with sheer willpower that he slowly took arduous steps forward and made his way to the door crack. The instant he reached the door, the pressure suddenly vanished, and he was welcomed with a feeling of incomparable ease.</span><br><span>He had finally survived the worst. There was no longer any obstacle ahead.</span><br><span>He looked back and saw a trail of sweat-soaked footsteps behind him. Those were all his sweat. Still gasping for air, he let out a hearty laughter. It had been so difficult for him to overcome that barrier, to the point that he truly thought about giving up.</span><br><span>It was sheer determination that sustained him all the way here.</span><br><span>He felt that no one else would have been able to do the same, which filled him with a profound sense of satisfaction. Only those who had triumphed in the face of adversity would understand the euphoria running through his body.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let me see what&rsquo;s behind the door.&rdquo;</span><br><span>A blinding light glared at Chu Feng as he stepped through the door. As the light faded, his face slowly warped in shock. What he was seeing before him was simply too eerie.</span><br><span>Even Eggy couldn&rsquo;t help but remark, &ldquo;What's with this place?!&rdquo;</span><br></p></div>
