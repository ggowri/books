        <h1>Chapter 5204</h1>
        <div>: Xue Ji, Save Me<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng sensed that something was amiss, but Eggy refused to say anything no matter how he tried to probe her. She insisted that he was thinking too much into it.<br>Some time later, the light pillars representing the six spirit worlds vanished.<br>&ldquo;Does this mean that the spirit world gates have closed? That&rsquo;s fast.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng did take some time to acquire the Asura God Stones, but an ancient remnant of this scale usually took a much longer time to explore. It was weird that the six gates were closing that quickly.<br>The likelier chance was that someone had obtained a key fortuitous encounter in the six gates, resulting in them automatically closing.<br>&ldquo;Young brother Chu Feng,&rdquo; a familiar voice sounded shortly after.<br>Chu Feng turned his eyes over and saw Tao Wu and Old Cat.<br>Even though he was in his concealed state, Tao Wu was still able to ascertain his location and approach him as if he was visible to the plain eye.<br>&ldquo;Young brother Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s head somewhere else to talk.&rdquo;<br>As he spoke, Tao Wu dragged Chu Feng over to a more remote location.<br>&ldquo;Elder, Old Cat, it looks like you have made quite some gains in the spirit world gates?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He was able to deduce as much from the bright smiles on Tao Wu and Old Cat&rsquo;s faces.<br>&ldquo;You can say so. More importantly, we&rsquo;re now qualified to proceed deeper. The gate inside the pit will soon open, but most people will not be allowed to advance any further. We&rsquo;re probably the only ones other than the other powerhouses who will be granted access. This is all thanks to Brother Tao,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>&ldquo;I also managed to obtain something good. Young brother Chu Feng, take this pill,&rdquo; Tao Wu said as he passed a pill over to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng assessed the pill and immediately noticed its peculiarities. Instead of medicinal energy, what was harnessed inside the pill was condensed spirit power. On top of that, there was a restriction on the pill that allowed only juniors to consume it.<br>Chu Feng knew that he was the only one in their group who was able to consume the pill, so he took it without any hesitation and swallowed it down.<br>&ldquo;Holy shit! Shouldn&rsquo;t you at least ask what the pill&rsquo;s effects are before consuming it? Do you trust me that much? Aren&rsquo;t you afraid that I might harm you?&rdquo;<br>Tao Wu looked at Chu Feng in bewilderment.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I trust you. I can tell that the pill harnesses a formation that&rsquo;ll automatically be activated once it&rsquo;s consumed. By then, I&rsquo;ll know what effects it has.&rdquo;<br>Just as Chu Feng said those words, a surge of spirit power flowed out from his body and formed a human-shaped barrier around him.<br>&ldquo;It really works! I can&rsquo;t see Brother Chu Feng anymore,&rdquo; Old Cat exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;Neither can I. Those powerhouses probably won&rsquo;t be able to see him too,&rdquo; Tao Wu said.<br>&ldquo;Is this a concealment formation? It&rsquo;s formidable!&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked delightedly.<br>He could tell better than anyone else just how powerful this concealment formation was. Unless he dispelled this formation on his own accord, it would probably take a True God level cultivator to find him.<br>Of course, this concealment formation had a time limit on it too. It would automatically dispel once the time was up.<br>&ldquo;Elder, it must have been difficult for you to acquire this treasure, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You need not bother about that. I came out safe and sound, and that&rsquo;s all that matters,&rdquo; Tao Wu replied with a smile.<br>&ldquo;It was really dangerous. Brother Tao Wu snatched it from the hands of Daoist Eighth Dragon. We were intending to give up on it, but Brother Tao chose to fight for it upon learning that it can only be consumed by juniors,&rdquo; Old Cat replied.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to that Old Kitty. He&rsquo;s exaggerating things. The two of us were protected by a formation inside the ancient remnant, such that even that Daoist Eighth Dragon was unable to do anything about us. Not to mention, he doesn&rsquo;t even know that I&rsquo;m the culprit who stole the pill from him. That being said, we should definitely stay away from him if we do encounter him later on,&rdquo; Tao Wu said with a chuckle.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I really don&rsquo;t know how I should thank you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt even more touched upon learning that Tao Wu had risked his life for him.<br>&ldquo;Eyy, we&rsquo;re all brothers on the same boat. Let&rsquo;s not put distance between us,&rdquo; Tao Wu said.<br>&ldquo;Mmhm,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.<br>He would remember the favor Tao Wu had shown him today. In the future, if Tao Wu had any need for him, he would brave even the infernos of hell for him.<br>&ldquo;Speaking of which, you mentioned Daoist Eighth Dragon instead of Daoist Ninth Dragon earlier? Could their other brothers be here too?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had heard that there were nine people in the Totem&rsquo;s Nine Daoists, and their strength correlated to their respective positions.<br>Daoist Ninth Dragon was the weakest one of the group, but the earlier massive formation that sealed off the gaseous flame was constructed by none other than him. If even he wielded such tremendous power, Daoist Eighth Dragon was bound to be even harder to deal with.<br>Perhaps, Daoist Eighth Dragon might even be a True God level cultivator.<br>&ldquo;We have only spotted Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Ninth Dragon thus far. Currently, there are three people we need to keep our guards up against: Daoist Eighth Dragon, Daoist Ninth Dragon, and the Demon Spirit King,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>&ldquo;Do you know their cultivation levels?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The good news is that none of them have reached True God level yet. That being said, unless we acquire some type of advantage over them, we don&rsquo;t stand a chance against them at all,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>Boom boom boom!<br>The entrance of the pit suddenly began rumbling loudly.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s opening! The gate inside the pit is opening!&rdquo; Old Cat exclaimed excitedly.<br>He was confident about challenging this ancient remnant despite the powerhouses they were up against only because he had witnessed Tao Wu&rsquo;s means. He was certain that he would be able to obtain something good out of this just by following Tao Wu&rsquo;s instructions.<br>Even if he was unable to outdo those powerhouses, he wouldn&rsquo;t return empty-handed.<br>&ldquo;Wait first. Let the powerhouses enter the gate first,&rdquo; Tao Wu said.<br>Chu Feng and Old Cat did as they were told.<br>&ldquo;Alright, we can head out now.&rdquo;<br>Some time later, Tao Wu brought Chu Feng and Old Cat into the pit together with him.<br>Weng!<br>But before they could venture too deeply into the pit, a powerful force suddenly sealed their pathway. It was so strong that not even Tao Wu or Old Cat was able to break free.<br>What was worth mentioning was that the force passed right through Chu Feng, not restraining him in the least. It turned out that the concealment formation had the power to protect him from being restrained too.<br>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t run away. He couldn&rsquo;t just leave Tao Wu and Old Cat to the lurch.<br>It was then that two figures came into appearance. They were the Demon Spirit King and Xue Ji.<br>&ldquo;Old Cat, where&rsquo;s Chu Feng?&rdquo; the Demon Spirit King asked.<br>&ldquo;What are you doing? We&rsquo;re on the same side!&rdquo; Old Cat replied.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you where Chu Feng is. I know that you came here with him. If you don&rsquo;t want to suffer, you better not test my patience.&rdquo;<br>As he spoke, the Demon Spirit King opened his palm and a wisp of black aura rose from his palm. Within this aura contained countless worms with black fangs. Just looking at them was enough to raise goosebumps.<br>&ldquo;Xue Ji, save me! Save me!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that things were turning awry, Old Cat could only turn to Xue Ji for help.<br></p></div>
