        <div> - Great Changes On The Sea Surface<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd stood up, before his body recovered completely, lightning appeared from his body.<br>The lightning was extremely powerful. It seemed like countless ferocious beasts shining brightly around his body.<br>When that happened, his tattered body started to crumble apart.<br>The Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd started to reveal a look of pain.<br>&ldquo;This power is still here?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the lightning that was still wreaking havoc throughout his tattered body, a look of disbelief appeared in the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t underestimate my ability.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is the strongest ability that I currently possess,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha.&rdquo;<br>After hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd actually burst into laughter.<br>Even though the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd was clearly about to be defeated by Chu Feng without any way to turn the situation around at all, he still laughed in such a manner. His behavior could be said to be extremely baffling.<br>Even Chu Feng felt puzzled, and slightly uneasy.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s unease was naturally because he was afraid. He was afraid that the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd still had some means to contend against him.<br>After all, his opponent was the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.<br>However, to Chu Feng&rsquo;s surprise, the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd suddenly said, &ldquo;Although your cultivation is very weak, you&rsquo;re able to grasp such a technique. You could be considered to be slightly capable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re barely qualified to obtain my initial acknowledgement.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it is only my initial acknowledgement.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you want to obtain my complete power, the current you is still unworthy.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd&rsquo;s body completely dissipated.<br>As the body of the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd dissipated, the surroundings also began to change.<br>In fact, even the location where Chu Feng stood began to change.<br>Originally, after the battle, the distance between Chu Feng and the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd was very far.<br>However, Chu Feng now found that he was standing right beside the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.<br>Not only that, but the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had also appeared before Chu Feng.<br>This made Chu Feng realize that what the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had said earlier was true. Earlier, he was only inside an illusion. The place where he stood at that moment was the real world.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng closed his eyes and began to examine his body.<br>After examining his body, Chu Feng finally heaved a sigh of relief.<br>Even though he had returned to the real world, his health was extremely weak.<br>Everything inside the illusion had truly occurred.<br>Thus, he had still grasped the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes&rsquo;s First Slash, Heavenly Lightning Appearance.<br>Even though it was only the first slash, the might of this one attack was capable of killing those a level of cultivation higher than him.<br>Without a doubt, the Heavenly Lightning Appearance was capable of replacing the Immortal Taboo: Blood Lightning Technique as Chu Feng&rsquo;s strongest attack.<br>Furthermore, this was only the first slash.<br>The Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes constituted a total of nine slashes. The might of each slash was much stronger than the one before.<br>That was the reason why Chu Feng was so excited. Chu Feng felt that if he could completely grasp the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes, it could present him with an invincible power.<br>&ldquo;Haha. Boy, never would I have imagined that you would actually manage to succeed.&rdquo;<br>As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said those words, he arrived before the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd and pulled it out.<br>&ldquo;Roooarrr~~~&rdquo;<br>Once he pulled out the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd, anguished howls began to sound in succession. Chu Feng was able to see over ten thousand bodies of light flying over while wailing in anguish.<br>Ultimately, all those strange bodies of light entered the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.<br>Chu Feng knew that those bodies of light were the guardian spirits.<br>&ldquo;Haha. Boy, even your father failed when he challenged the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd in the past.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, you actually succeeded. I guess this means the young shall surpass the old.&rdquo;<br>As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke, he put away the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd. He felt very joyous, and was smiling very brilliantly.<br>&ldquo;Senior, my father also challenged the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He challenged it just like you challenged it earlier,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;If my father failed his challenge, how did he manage to survive?&rdquo; Chu Feng was very curious.<br>&ldquo;You only have an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time to attempt to defeat it. After an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time passes, you will not have the chance to defeat it anymore. As for whether or not you&rsquo;ll be able to survive, it will depend on the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your father is not the only one that challenged it. Your grandfather and even this old man have challenged it before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, the number of people that managed to find the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd and challenge it are not limited to only the three of us. However, before you, only the three of us have ever managed to survive it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, although we failed our challenge, we could be considered to have obtained the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd&rsquo;s acknowledgement. Otherwise, it would not have spared us,&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng realized that even if one failed, one would not necessarily die.<br>Whether or not one lived or died would all depend on the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd.<br>&ldquo;Senior, do you know how to leave this place?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Since they had successfully obtained the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd, they would have to quickly leave.<br>After all, Chu Feng still didn&rsquo;t know how Chu Lingxi was doing. He was still very worried about her.<br>&ldquo;Since this old man has been here for all these years, I naturally know how to leave this place. Come, follow me.&rdquo;<br>After the Ox-nosed Old Daoist finished saying those words, he began to swim toward the east.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please wait a moment.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he began to swim upward.<br>Since he had decided to leave, he would naturally not leave Chu Xuanzhengfa behind.<br>After Chu Feng returned, he discovered that Chu Xuanzhengfa was already awake. He had been waiting for Chu Feng ever since he read his note after regaining consciousness.<br>After seeing Chu Xuanzhengfa, Chu Feng did not bother to provide much of an explanation, and only stated that he had discovered a method to leave that place, and told Chu Xuanzhengfa to follow him to meet up with the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>After they returned, the two of them followed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Even after having obtained the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd, the sea did not change much.<br>However, what Chu Feng and the others didn&rsquo;t know was that the surface of the Mirror Sea that was originally extremely tranquil was no longer tranquil.<br>Massive waves had appeared on the surface of the sea that was originally akin to a mirror. The smallest waves measured over a thousand meters, and the largest waves were over ten thousand meters.<br>Such giant waves covered the entire surface of the boundless Mirror Sea.<br>It seemed as if the vast sea had been reduced to hell. It was truly terrifying to see.<br>Seeing the situation change, even Gu Mingyuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu were unable to keep calm.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, what is happening? Why did this change happen?&rdquo; asked Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;Although I do not know why, this is the first time this sort of thing has happened to the Mirror Sea. It would appear that some sort of massive change has happened in the Mirror Sea,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Massive change; this was naturally a massive change. This was something that Grandmaster Liangqiu didn&rsquo;t need to explain. Gu Mingyuan had guessed it herself.<br>Merely, she wanted to know why such a change would occur to the Mirror Sea all of a sudden.<br>After all, such a massive change would truly make one uneasy.<br>Not knowing why this had happened, Gu Mingyuan grabbed Chu Lingxi, who was on her back, even tighter. The look of worry in her eyes grew even more intense.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Chu Xuanzhengfa, the two of you must return safely,&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan muttered softly.<br></p></div>
