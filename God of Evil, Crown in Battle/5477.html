        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;Hoh. It looks like the elders of the Totem Dragon Clan aren&rsquo;t fools, after all. They know how to expand their options,&rdquo; Eggy remarked with a chuckle.</span><br><span>She hadn&rsquo;t expected such a situation.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was surprised as well. He was prepared to be punished, but who could have thought that the Totem Dragon Clan would apologize to him and even offer him a God Armament?</span><br><span>Many times he had encountered powerhouses on his journey that stood in his path like towering mountains. While these mountains had now been trampled under his feet, they most definitely posed a huge threat to him back then.</span><br><span>A common trait amongst these powerhouses was that they were arrogant and conceited.</span><br><span>Even if they did change their perception of Chu Feng later on, it was only after he had matured and surpassed them. It was rare to see a powerhouse treating him in such a manner as the Totem Dragon Clan did.</span><br><span>This made him see the Totem Dragon Clan in a positive light.</span><br><span>Chu Feng looked at the tempting GodArmament and Long Xu&rsquo;s earnest expression, and that only made him feel even more guilt-ridden. Thus, he made a difficult decision.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, I can&rsquo;t accept your GodArmament. While it wasn&rsquo;t my intention to cause harm to your Totem Dragon Clan, I can&rsquo;t deny the fact that your clan protection formation was weakened due to me. I am too conscience-stricken to receive such a huge gift from you.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng chose to reject the gift.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, that matter has nothing to do with you. You have to accept this GodArmament,&rdquo; Long Xu persuaded him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, take the GodArmament. Our God Armaments are worth more than those outside. Even if you later find that the Golden Wing God Fire Spear isn&rsquo;t a good fit, you can always trade it for something better outside,&rdquo; Long Suqing told Chu Feng via voice transmission.</span><br><span>Astonishingly, even Long Kuitian had sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng to persuade him to accept the GodArmament.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu even went ahead to take the spear from Long Xu and stuff it into Chu Feng&rsquo;s arms. He winked at Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Take it, Brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;</span><br><span>It was almost as if he was indicating that Chu Feng would be a fool for not receiving such a huge benefit, which was ironic as this benefit came at the expense of his clan.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll accept your generosity then.&rdquo; Sensing the sincerity of the Totem Dragon Clan, Chu Feng accepted the God Armament.</span><br><span>He was not a reserved person. He had rejected the GodArmament because he thought that it was inappropriate for him to accept it after causing them trouble, but since they were insisting on it, it would have been rude of him to continue rejecting their goodwill.</span><br><span>After all, this God Armament was not just a gift but a symbol of friendship.</span><br><span>Most people might think that it was a foolish move on the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s part to use a God Armament to befriend Chu Feng, considering how valuable GodArmaments were. Still, Chu Feng would show all of them that the Totem Dragon Clan had made the right choice today.</span><br><span>Following that, the Totem Dragon Clan released a public announcement to explain the earlier happenings in the Armory Hall. They didn&rsquo;t mention the fact that they had gifted Chu Feng a </span><span>GodArmament, but they emphasized that it was an accident that had nothing to do with him.</span><br><span>This public announcement rattled the entire Totem Dragon Clan, particularly the juniors who were present at the main hall. The others might not be aware of it, but they had seen what had happened with their own eyes. They were certain that Chu Feng caused the incident.</span><br><span>This made them realize that the Totem Dragon Clan was trying to befriend Chu Feng, but they couldn&rsquo;t understand what was so special about Chu Feng for their clan to do that.</span><br><span>It was one thing for impressionable juniors like Long Chengyu and Long Muxi to have been deceived by Chu Feng, but the same shouldn&rsquo;t have happened for the elders.</span><br><span>Following that, Long Xu proceeded to personally interrogate Jia Lingyi, not neglecting to call Chu Feng over to spectate.</span><br><span>The interrogation was just a simple procedure to question Jia Lingyi if she had colluded with anyone else in the Totem Dragon Clan. Jia Lingyi, who was prepared to die, didn&rsquo;t reveal anything at all, but of course, the Totem Dragon Clan wouldn&rsquo;t let her easily get her way.</span><br><span>They inflicted cruel punishment on her on the spot, but Jia Lingyi had more spunk than they thought. She didn&rsquo;t lose her bearings till she passed out.</span><br><span>In the end, they had no choice but to drag Jia Lingyi down.</span><br><span>They would have usually just killed Jia Lingyi, but Long Xu spared her as Long Chengyu had promised Chu Feng to keep her alive.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I have already dispatched my men to the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. They&rsquo;ll have to give us a reasonable explanation for this. Also, you can be assured that our Totem Dragon Clan will go after them if the Pill Dao Immortal Sect dares to cause you any trouble,&rdquo; Long Xu told Chu Feng after the interrogation.</span><br><span>This was effectively a declaration that he was going to protect Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Thank you, elder,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>Bam!</span><br><span>Someone suddenly kicked open the palace doors, and a brawny old man with flowing white hair marched into the palace.</span><br><span>The brawny old man looked as if he had been around through the ages, but despite this, he looked to be in a good condition. His sharp eyebrows and narrow eyes suggested that he might not be an easy person to deal with. Just his appearance itself was many times more intimidating than a ferocious beast.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Long Xu, who allowed you to open the Armory Hall in advance?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Xu wasn&rsquo;t the only one in the room. Chu Feng, Long Chengyu, Long Muxi, Long Suqing, and the other elders of the Totem Dragon Clan were gathered here too, but not a single one of them spoke against the old man for challenging Long Xu&rsquo;s authority.</span><br><span>Even Long Xu, despite being the chief of the Nine Flags Dragon Warriors, looked like he had been put in a spot.</span><br><span>Just then, another elder entered the room. He bore a striking resemblance to the white-haired elder, just that his hair was black and he looked much younger and more amicable.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Father, what are you doing?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The black-haired elder quickly stood in the white-haired elder&rsquo;s way. It turned out that they were father and son.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Long Xu, please don&rsquo;t misunderstand. You also know that this is what my father&rsquo;s temper is like.&rdquo; The black-haired elder first tried to convince his father before lowering his </span><span>head to Long Xu out of embarrassment.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Misunderstanding? There&rsquo;s no misunderstanding here! I didn&rsquo;t vie for the two slots in the side hall out of respect for Lord Clan Chief, but there should at least be some slots for my grandson and my granddaughter for the main hall, right? Long Xu is clearly snubbing me by opening the Armory Hall in advance!&rdquo; the white-haired elder roared.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master Chengyu, young miss Muxi, you should first bring Chu Feng elsewhere to take a rest,&rdquo; Long Xu instructed.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu immediately dragged Chu Feng out of the room before fleeing from the place as quickly as possible.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chengyu, who are those two people?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That old thing is the most unreasonable person in our Totem Dragon Clan. Even my father struggles to deal with him due to his seniority and his strength. He won&rsquo;t let things rest easily if he ever learns that you have something to do with the incident in the Armory Hall. Let&rsquo;s first find somewhere safe for you and keep a lookout. If it looks like things are going awry, I&rsquo;ll immediately escort you out,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>That made Chu Feng realize that the old man was a difficult character to deal with.</span><br><span>Even when Long Xu ordered Chu Feng to be brought to the side palace, Long Chengyu thumped his chest and promised to keep Chu Feng safe. The thought of escaping didn&rsquo;t seem to have even crossed his mind. Yet, the first thing that Long Chengyu thought of when the old man appeared was to escape.</span><br><span>This was more than enough to show how terrifying the old man was.</span><br></p></div>
