        <div> - Spirit Formation Immortal Domain<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;There are countless remnants and wondrous lands in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Some wondrous lands are helpful to martial cultivators. As for some other wondrous lands, they are helpful toward world spiritists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There is a place with a special sort of power in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. That place is not only capable of helping world spiritists increase their spirit power, but it is also capable of helping world spiritists obtain comprehension in world spirit techniques.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That place is called the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Spirit Formation Immortal Domain originated from the Ancient Era. It seemed to have come into existence at the same time as the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Thus, no one knows of its origins.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the center of the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain is a lake. That lake is located at the summit of the highest peak in the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain. However, it is linked to the depths of the earth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Normally, there is nothing peculiar about that lake. However, every ten years, the lake water will start to change. A power will emerge from the depths of the lake. That power is filled with spirit formation symbols and runes.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those spirit formation symbols and runes are alive, and can be assimilated into one&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That lake is called the Buried Spirit Lake,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>&ldquo;Buried Spirit Lake?&rdquo; Chu Feng was very entranced. However, he was also very curious. Thus, he asked, &ldquo;Why is it called the Buried Spirit Lake?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;According to the legends, Buried Spirit Lake was originally known as the Heavenly Lake. When it was still known as the Heavenly Lake, it already contained mysteries pertaining to world spirit techniques.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, at that time, whenever the lake erupted, the symbols and runes emitted by the lake would be even more astonishing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A long time ago, genius world spiritists and expert world spiritists from all different realms gathered by the lake to jointly explore it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the end, they seemed to have managed to discover something in the Heavenly Lake and, for the sake of fighting over what they discovered, they started a massive battle inside the Heavenly Lake.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To world spiritists, that battle was most definitely an enormous loss. In fact, it could even be said to be a disaster.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that was because after that battle, all of the genius world spiritists and those grandmaster-level world spiritists were buried inside that Heavenly Lake.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After that, countless people tried to dive into the depths of the Heavenly Lake. They did not do so to explore the mysteries of the Heavenly Lake. Rather, they wanted to obtain the treasures of those fallen world spiritists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, all of the people that dove into the depths of the Heavenly Lake failed to return alive. Over time, no one dared to explore the depths of the Heavenly Lake again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Gradually, people started to call the Heavenly Lake Buried Spirit Lake, with the meaning that this lake was a place where world spiritists were buried.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As time passed, the power of Buried Spirit Lake has gradually weakened. As matters stand, Buried Spirit Lake is already of no assistance toward Exalted-cloak World Spiritists. However, it is still extremely beneficial for Immortal-cloak World Spiritists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Judging from the timing of things, Buried Spirit Lake will have its ten year change in roughly two months&rsquo; time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That being said, the change that happens once per decade is already very unstable. Thus, it&rsquo;s very difficult to predict exactly when the change will occur.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All I can predict is that it will happen in roughly two months.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That being said, the change will last for an entire day after it arrives.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are able to enter Buried Spirit Lake and wait till the day of the change, then, with your talent, you will most likely be able to make a breakthrough to become a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;In that case, senior, may I know where the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain is located?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;This map contains the route to the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master handed a map to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng immediately opened the map, and firmly remembered the route to the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain.<br>&ldquo;However Chu Feng, the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain is currently being guarded by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan. It&rsquo;s no longer a place that one can enter at will,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>&ldquo;Ah? The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan? Who are they?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan originated from the Ancient Era. Of course&hellip; although they have been in existence since the Ancient Era, they do not know about what happened in the Ancient Era. It&rsquo;s merely that their ancestor was alive in the Ancient Era. As for they themselves, they&rsquo;re merely existences belonging to this era.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan is a clan of monstrous beasts, they are experts in world spirit techniques. They are all born with spirit power. Compared to martial power, they are much stronger in terms of world spirit techniques. As for this&hellip; it is actually related to their bloodline.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain is not sealed off&hellip; the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan will patrol the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain incessantly. If anyone is to trespass and be captured, there will only be one outcome for them -- execution,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>&ldquo;How strong is the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Their strength surpasses our Immortal Armament Villa. Thus, you must definitely not try to charge your way through,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said with a smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;But, even though the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain is the territory of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan, that does not mean that others cannot enter it, no?&rdquo; As Chu Feng said those words, he took a glance at the peculiar title plate the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master was holding in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Haha. Boy, you are truly clever,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master laughed. Then, he said, &ldquo;As long as one possesses this invitation title plate, one will be able to enter the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can consider it a greeting gift from this old man,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master handed the title plate to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Thank you senior,&rdquo; Chu Feng accepted the title plate without any hesitation.<br>As this was a rare opportunity, Chu Feng absolutely could not miss it. After all, this was a chance for him to become a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Should he become a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, Chu Feng&rsquo;s weaponry refinement techniques would also become stronger. Should that happen, it would also make it easier for him to refine a weapon.<br>Should that happen, Chu Feng could use the All Equilibrium Weaponry Refinement Chart with greater proficiency. In turn, his martial cultivation would also progress faster.<br>To the current Chu Feng, his world spirit techniques and martial cultivation were already intimately related with one another.<br>&ldquo;This Chu Feng will definitely repay senior for his kindness,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Haha. I&rsquo;ve already said that it is merely a greeting gift. I have no plan for you to repay me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you really want to repay me, you can join our Immortal Armament Villa or become this old man&rsquo;s disciple,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said with a beaming smile on his face.<br>Chu Feng did not answer. He merely went along with the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master and smiled foolishly.<br>What sort of person was the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master? Even though he still did not want to miss out on Chu Feng, he was able to tell that Chu Feng was determined. Thus, he did not continue to linger on the topic.<br>&ldquo;Senior, there are some things that this junior wanted to ask senior about,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Go ahead and tell me what they are. As long as it&rsquo;s something that this old man can tell you, this old man will definitely tell you,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master replied with a faint smile. He actually answered Chu Feng the same way he had answered him earlier.<br>&ldquo;As this junior is from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, an Ordinary Realm, my understanding towards martial cultivation is limited.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, there is one thing that I wish to ask senior about.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is, are there any differences between Immortal Techniques and Immortal Taboo Martial Skills?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>Back then, Chu Feng had picked up an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill in the wasteland world.<br>Chu Feng had attempted to learn it before. However, it was truly too difficult. That Immortal Taboo Martial Skill had a very high requirement toward one&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>At the very least, it was far out of the question for the current Chu Feng to learn it. Chu Feng suspected that one could only learn Immortal Taboo Martial Skills after reaching the Heavenly Immortal level of cultivation.<br>However, Chu Xianshuo had managed to unleash a so-called Immortal Technique. Thus, Chu Feng determined that Immortal Techniques and Immortal Taboo Martial Skills were definitely two different sorts of abilities.<br>Chu Feng had actually asked the question so that he could understand what Immortal Techniques were.<br>&ldquo;Those two abilities are naturally completely different.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Immortal Taboo Martial Skills are martial skills, whereas Immortal Techniques are a sort of mystical technique.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You already know what martial skills are. Martial power serves as the foundation of martial skills. As long as one possesses the method to unleash a martial skill and possesses sufficient strength to do so, one will be able to unleash a martial skill. This is the strongest offensive technique that martial cultivators possesses.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for Immortal Techniques, they are a sort of technique that combines both martial power and spirit power. Most importantly, Immortal Techniques have restrictions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is, Immortal Techniques can only be used once within a certain period of time. After using it once, one will not be able to use an Immortal Technique again until its cooldown is done.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Take the match between you and Chu Xianshuo as an example. After he shot forth his punch, regardless of whether he won or lost, he would not be able to use that punch again,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s VIlla Master said.<br><br><br></p></div>
