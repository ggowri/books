        <h1>Chapter 4327</h1>
        <div>: Truly My Savior<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was just that the light in Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s eyes swiftly vanished right after.<br>It was not that she was unwilling to trust Chu Feng, but this was the Dragon Clan they were talking about. Furthermore, she knew just what kind of person her father was.<br>Her father hated outsiders interfering in their family business.<br>Back then, when her father had decided to punish her mother, there were many Supreme Elders who tried to talk him out of it, to no avail.<br>Even someone of Long Shengbu&rsquo;s standingwas imprisoned for speaking up for her mother.<br>Against her father, no matter how capable Chu Feng was, it was unlikely that he would be able to help her.<br>Besides, Chu Feng was only a junior. How much say could he possibly have here?<br>Unless a powerhouse on the level of the Holy Light Clan were to appear, no one else in the Holy Light Galaxy would be able to help her.<br>But even though Long Xiaoxiao thought that Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t be able to save her, she was still delighted to see him once more.<br>&ldquo;Little benefactor, are you here to see me? I&rsquo;m really sorry for showing you this side of me,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao said with a slightly disheartened look.<br>She wanted to show Chu Feng the beautiful side of her, not how she currently looked.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, everything will be over soon. It&rsquo;s just that&hellip; how did you end up in such a plight? Did your mother really commit a heinous crime?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Little benefactor, in clans like ours, even blood kin will turn against one another for their own interest, let alone stepsisters. My mother and Mumu&rsquo;s mother were the two wives that my father favored the most. The reason for that is not because of their beauty, but their outstanding capabilities.<br>&ldquo;But those who work for my father need to have some means in order to accomplish anything substantial. It was inevitable that they would sometimes have to cross the line. When everything was good and fine, my father wouldn&rsquo;t pursue these matters. However, if a day comes where they lose their influence, those mistakes will become incriminating evidence that will condemn them to the depths of the abyss.&rdquo;<br>As Long Xiaoxiao said these words, a helpless smile formed on her lips.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t just helplessness she was feeling. She also felt bitter at the callousness of her father.<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s words were very concise, but Chu Feng still caught her drift.<br>In the end, it was just a difference in favor.<br>When Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother still had the Clan Chief&rsquo;s love, nothing she did could be considered a mistake at all. But as soon as she lost his love, everything she did was a mistake.<br>So, Long Xiaoxiao and her mother didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. They had only lost the Clan Chief&rsquo;s favor.<br>This made Chu Feng feel the callousness of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, as well as the callousness of the entire Dragon Clan.<br>This wasn&rsquo;t a situation exclusive to the Dragon Clan. In fact, it was the same for most major clans too.<br>Chu Feng had had firsthand experience of it himself.<br>Back then, when his father erred, there were plenty in the Chu Heavenly Clan who put him down. In fact, even when he returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan, there were still plenty of clan members who sought to harm him.<br>Even though they were all humans, they were really different through and through.<br>Some were loyal and sentimental, willing to stake their all for their friends. Chu Feng had seen such people before.<br>But there were also those who would betray their friends and kin for the sake of their own interests. Chu Feng had also seen such people before.<br>While it was really unfortunate that things turned out this way, it was not completely unexpected.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, even though an outsider like me shouldn&rsquo;t interfere in the affairs of your family, as a friend, I would still like to offer you my help. Right now, there&rsquo;s a way that&hellip; I might just be able to help you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;A way that you might just be able to help me?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s eyes lit up yet again.<br>She was surprised to hear such words from Chu Feng directly, but it made her believe once again.<br>&ldquo;Do you know of your clan&rsquo;s Dragon Vein Source?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Dragon Vein Source? Of course I do!&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao replied.<br>&ldquo;Something has happened to the Dragon Vein Source just a moment ago. There&rsquo;s a chance that your clan might be able to make use of this impetus to open it. The Dragon Clan holds the Dragon Vein Source in high regard, and your father is determined to open it regardless of the cost,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Are you certain? Something happened to the Dragon Vein Source?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked in bewilderment.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it. I saw it with my own eyes,&rdquo; Long Nanxun replied.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful! Are the heavens finally favoring our Dragon Clan?&rdquo;<br>This news seemed to have made Long Xiaoxiao forget about the plight she was in. She was earnestly happy for the Dragon Clan.<br>From this, Chu Feng could tell that Long Xiaoxiao didn&rsquo;t feel any hatred toward the Dragon Clan. Instead, she harbored deep feelings for it.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good chance that the Dragon Vein Source can be successfully opened this time around, and my master and I are here to make it happen. Right now, my master is trying to figure out a way to do so. If he succeeds, it&rsquo;ll be a huge merit to his name. With that, it might work if he were to speak on your mother&rsquo;s behalf,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll work. It&rsquo;ll definitely work!&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao exclaimed in agitation.<br>She knew just how much the Dragon Clan valued the Dragon Vein Source.<br>If Chu Feng and his master could help open it, they would have become the benefactors of the Dragon Clan. Even her father would be deeply indebted to them.<br>As the benefactors of their Dragon Clan, their words would hold a lot of weight.<br>&ldquo;There are still many uncertainties surrounding this matter though. If we were to plead on your behalf only after the Dragon Vein Source opens, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that something might happen in between. But if we were to do it right now before accomplishing anything at all, the response of your father is likely to be unfavorable,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. It wouldn&rsquo;t be good to make the request of him right now,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao replied.<br>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I know my father&rsquo;s personality well. He doesn&rsquo;t like to be threatened by anyone,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao replied.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, I know that you&rsquo;re worried, but the circumstances are a little complicated right now. My master has already made it clear to your father that opening the Dragon Vein Source is a dangerous act, and the only reason why the two of us are willing to take this risk is due to us beingindebted to you. Do you get it now?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng explained the current situation, as well as the chips they had in their hand, to Long Xiaoxiao in detail<br>Given Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s wits, it didn&rsquo;t take her too long to catch Chu Feng&rsquo;s drift.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how can I thank you for this?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s eyes had already reddened in agitation.<br>Chu Feng had already saved her once in the remnant. She had never dared to dream that during a moment when she was cornered and desperate, Chu Feng would appear before her once again.<br>And this time, it was very likely that he would become her savior yet again.<br>She really didn&rsquo;t know how she could ever repay what he had done for her.<br>&ldquo;You can treat it as if you owe me a favor, and return it to me in the future,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;ll surely return the favor, definitely!&rdquo;<br>Tears of joy brimmed in Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s eyes as she nodded vehemently.<br>&ldquo;However, you need to condition your body properly and heal up first. If you don&rsquo;t mind, allow me to help you with that,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>The reason why Long Xiaoxiao had ended up in her current state was due to her taking forbidden medicines and practicing a forbidden martial skill, only to fail in the end.<br>And to be honest, she was already lucky to have only ended up in such a state.<br>Forcefully cultivating a forbidden martial skill in order to force a breakthrough in one&rsquo;s cultivation was an extremely dangerous act. In the worst-case scenario, she might even lose control of her cultivation and die as a result.<br>While the worst hadn&rsquo;t occurred, Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s body had still weakened considerably. She had to condition her body quickly, or else her physical condition would only worsen with time.<br></p></div>
