        <div> - Inheritance Seized<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;We naturally cannot disrespect our honored guests. Without concrete evidence, it is indeed inappropriate for us to cause a major disturbance. However, I believe that Qiuci should not be lying,&rdquo; Kong Yuehua said as she looked to Kong Ruozeng&rsquo;s mother.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, this matter is of the utmost importance. This Qiuci would not dare to lie to everyone,&rdquo; Kong Ruozeng&rsquo;s mother said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We have watched over Qiuci since she was a child, we all know Qiuci&rsquo;s character very well. She would never frame someone,&rdquo; The elders all felt very confident in the character of Kong Ruozeng&rsquo;s mother.<br>&ldquo;Thus, that Chu Feng is definitely suspicious. However, since it is difficult for us, people of the older generation, to step in, we should have people of the younger generation do the deed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The people of the younger generation are unthoughtful. Even if they&rsquo;re to truly cause some sort of trouble, I believe that outsiders will not say anything,&rdquo; As Kong Yuehua spoke, she looked to Kong Ruozeng.<br>&ldquo;Lady Supreme Elder, your intention is&hellip; to have Ruozeng go and provoke Chu Feng so as to force him out?&rdquo; Kong Ruozeng&rsquo;s father understood Kong Yuehua&rsquo;s intention.<br>&ldquo;Go on ahead. If you are to encounter any problems, I will back you all up,&rdquo; Kong Yuehua said.<br>&ldquo;This junior Kong Ruozeng will definitely not fail to live up to Lady Supreme Elder&rsquo;s expectations,&rdquo; At that moment, Kong Ruozeng revealed an extremely delighted expression.<br>When he had gone to cause troubles for Chu Feng earlier, even though he had possessed backing, he had still felt somewhat diffident in his heart.<br>However, it was different this time around. With the Supreme Elder Kong Yuehua as his backing, Kong Ruozeng could do whatever he wanted to do; he would no longer have to be afraid anymore.<br>After the decision was made Kong Yuehua personally gave the order to send away the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s experts tasked with guarding Chu Feng and Wang Qiang&rsquo;s palace, their residence in the Kong Heavenly Clan.<br>After all, even if they intended to have Kong Ruozeng, a member of the younger generation, cause troubles for Chu Feng, they could not do it too obviously. They must transfer all of the experts and make others think that Kong Ruozeng was seizing this opportunity to provoke Chu Feng again.<br>Afterward, Kong Ruozeng directly arrived outside of Chu Feng&rsquo;s palace. This time around, he did not shout from outside. Rather, he directly smashed at the entrance, forcing his way in.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>A punch shot forth, sending energy ripples all over. The iron fragments of the entrance gate started to flutter about in midair.<br>That Kong Ruozeng actually used a martial skill to pulverize the palace&rsquo;s entrance gate.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, scram the hell out here!!!&rdquo; Kong Ruozeng shouted loudly as he proceeded into the palace. He already knew where Chu Feng was undergoing closed-door training. Thus, he had a clear-cut purpose when going in there.<br>&ldquo;Fuck y-you!&rdquo; Right at that moment, a figure suddenly appeared and blocked Kong Ruozeng&rsquo;s path.<br>This person was naturally Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;F-fucking hell, h-how fucking un-uneducated are you? Not only a-are you making a h-huge ruckus, y-you&rsquo;ve even f-fucking s-smashed a-apart the entrance gate and f-forced your way through?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;C-Could it b-be that y-you&rsquo;ve g-grown a-addicted to the m-medicinal punishment, and w-want to e-experience it again?&rdquo; Wang Qiang stared at Kong Ruozeng in a very displeased manner.<br>Even though Wang Qiang was also there as a guest, it remained that the palace was his residence there. As such, he felt extremely displeased to have the entrance gate smashed apart by someone.<br>&ldquo;Humph, where is Chu Feng? Tell him to get the hell out here. Today&hellip; I insist on challenging him,&rdquo; Kong Ruozeng said.<br>&ldquo;C-Challenge my brother? Y-you t-think someone like you is q-qualified?&rdquo; Wang Qiang looked at Kong Ruozeng and smiled with contempt. His smile was extremely low and vile, to the point that even bystanders would feel angered by it.<br>As such, Kong Ruozeng was so furious that his face turned red. He pointed at Wang Qiang and said fiercely, &ldquo;Scram! Else, do not blame me for being impolite!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Impolite? Toward me? Yoh yoh yoh, l-little c-child, d-do you not f-fear that y-your incisors will f-fall off by b-boasting like that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your g-granddaddy Qiang will be a-able to beat t-trash like you r-rolling on the ground crying f-for mommy with merely one hand,&rdquo; Wang Qiang said with a laugh.<br>&ldquo;You are truly one who refuses a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit,&rdquo; As Kong Ruozeng spoke, he raised his arm with the intention to attack Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Rumble, rumble, rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, rumbles sounded from the ninth heaven above.<br>The sound was so resounding that it startled both heaven and earth.<br>Turning upward, one could see that black clouds flickering with lightning densely covered the sky.<br>Although the black clouds did not cover a very vast area, the surging black clouds appeared to be composed of an army of a myriad of demons. As the demon army galloped in the sky, one would feel an extremely painful oppressive sensation. It was so frightening that one would feel as if one was suffocating.<br>As for the lightning flickering within the clouds, it was the main source of the crowd&rsquo;s fears.<br>That lightning was simply too frightening. It was definitely no ordinary lightning. Rather, it looked like dragons.<br>Those were dragons of lightning. They possessed boundless power, and were capable of splitting apart heaven and earth, killing all living things.<br>&ldquo;What is that?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Kong Ruozeng, who had been about to attack Wang Qiang, immediately walked out of the palace and looked to the sky.<br>In all his life, never had he ever seen anything like that. This was simply too terrifying.<br>&ldquo;What is going on?!&rdquo;<br>In fact, it was not only Kong Ruozeng. The Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s various elders, and even Kong Shunlian and Kong Moyu, the two Supreme Elders guarding the entrance of the Grief Calamity Mountain, the two True Immortal-level experts, also revealed expressions of unease as they looked to the lightning cloud in the sky.<br>&ldquo;Lady Supreme Elder, this is bad!&rdquo; The people in the ancient pagoda were also astonished. Those that were observing the situation outside began to run toward Kong Yuehua to report the matter to her.<br>&ldquo;What are you all making such a big fuss about?&rdquo; Kong Yuehua was originally completely focused on staring at the spirit formation. As such, she did not have the heart to look outside.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an abnormal sign in the sky. It is likely a calamity appearing above the skies of our Kong Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; The elders outside said in a frightened manner.<br>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Hearing those words, Kong Yuehua hurriedly got up and arrived outside the ancient pagoda.<br>&ldquo;That is?!!!&rdquo; After she saw the lightning clouds deep in the sky, she also revealed an extremely astonished expression.<br>At that moment, the Kong Heavenly Clan started to panic.<br>The reason for that was because regardless of their age or what sort of cultivation they might possess, they all felt enormous danger from the lightning clouds deep in the sky. It was a sort of danger that they could not withstand.<br>&ldquo;That thing&hellip;&rdquo;<br>However, compared to the others, a member of the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation actually had a completely different expression.<br>That person was Kong Zheng.<br>Compared to his clansmen, it was not the first time that he had seen that frightening scene in the sky. Even though the scene was even more frightening than the ones he had seen in the Hundred Refinements Stage, he still involuntarily turned his gaze toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s residence.<br>Kong Zheng had suddenly realized that this seemed to not be a coincidence.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a lightning strike suddenly struck down from the black clouds above. It was aimed directly at the Kong Heavenly Clan.<br>At that moment, the hearts of all the people in the Kong Heavenly Clan sunk to the valley floor.<br>To them, the lightning striking down from above was not merely lightning. Rather, it was a calamity.<br>At that moment, it was the descent of a calamity.<br>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s going to strike that palace, then this abnormal sign will definitely be related to Chu Feng,&rdquo; Kong Zheng&rsquo;s eyes were fixed in the direction of the palace that served as Chu Feng and Wang Qiang&rsquo;s residence.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Finally, that lightning strike landed. However, it did not cause any destruction, nor was anyone injured.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?!&rdquo; As for Kong Zheng, he revealed a completely astonished expression.<br>The reason for that was because the lightning strike did not land at the palace that served as Chu Feng&rsquo;s residence. Rather, it landed in the Grief Calamity Mountain Range.<br>&ldquo;Grief Calamity Mountain Range? Could it be&hellip; our Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s inheritance has already been snatched away?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s three Supreme Elders and the many upper echelon elders were all endlessly furious. They clenched their fists in anger.<br>They had no idea how the Divine Tribulation&rsquo;s lightning had come about. However, as it landed in the Grief Calamity Mountain Range, the first thing that came to their minds was their inheritance.<br>Thus, they felt that someone must&rsquo;ve received their Kong Primogenitor&rsquo;s inheritance, that the abnormal sign was caused by that.<br>This was something that they could not tolerate. Yet, at that moment, they were powerless to do anything.<br>In that sort of situation, many of the Kong Heavenly Clansmen wanted to rush into the Grief Calamity Mountain Range and capture that intruder with no regard for their own safety.<br>However, they were all stopped by Kong Shunlian and Kong Moyu.<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...<br>The truth was, the lightning was indeed aroused from the Grief Calamity Mountain Range and their inheritance had indeed been snatched away.<br>Merely, that lightning was unrelated to their Kong Primogenator&rsquo;s inheritance.<br>The reason for that was because that lightning was caused by a single person, Chu Feng.<br>In the depths of the Grief Calamity Mountain Range, inside that palace, Chu Feng was still sitting cross-legged.<br>However, lightning filled his surroundings. The lightning had penetrated the concealment formation Chu Feng had set up and reached Chu Feng&rsquo;s surroundings. Like blades of lightning, they were penetrating Chu Feng&rsquo;s body nonstop.<br>The lightning bolts were penetrating his skin and bones, and were even on the verge of penetrating Chu Feng&rsquo;s dantian to permeate his soul.<br>More and more lightning began to gather. Their aura also grew more and more frightening. Toward the end, it was as if there were countless frightening hands of lightning grabbing onto Chu Feng with the intention to rip him apart.<br>At that moment, even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes were tightly closed, he was showing a painful expression.<br>However, he had to grit his teeth and bear the pain. He had to endure this sort of torture.<br>The reason for that was because he would only be able to reach a breakthrough by enduring such tribulation.<br><br></p></div>
