        <div>: A Good Friend<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On his way to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, Chu Feng met several other powers, and they were all holding keys that would allow them to open certain grounds or remnants.<br>Having understood the story behind this, he wasn&rsquo;t too surprised by that anymore.<br>Rather, as he was in a hurry to meet City Master Long Daozhi of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, he continued rushing ahead, not stopping even after spotting some familiar faces along the way.<br>Soon, he arrived at Ancestral Martial Dragon City.<br>This grand city was not a place that anyone could enter easily.<br>Yet, Chu Feng was able to pass through its entrance easily without even taking out the invitation token he had in hand. As soon as those of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City saw Chu Feng, they immediately granted his passageway with the most respectful of attitudes.<br>After Chu Feng expressed the intention behind his visit, he was swiftly ushered toward a palace to wait for Long Daozhi.<br>Soon enough, the doors of the palace opened, and four figures entered one after another. However, Long Daozhi was not amongst the four figures.<br>That being said, a slight smile still formed on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face after seeing these four people. There were peers whom Chu Feng were familiar with.<br>The most talented junior of the Divine Body Royal City, Kong Ci.<br>The most talented junior of the Monstrous Holy City, Xian Yun.<br>And the most talented junior of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, Long Ning.<br>On top of being extraordinarily talented and powerful, the three of them were also famed for their exceptional appearances which were reminiscent of heavenly fairies. For this reason, Kong Tianhui had jokingly referred to them as the Flowers of the Three Cities.<br>Of course, given that Kong Ci was present, it went without saying that her elder brother, Kong Tianhui, was around too.<br>As soon as Kong Tianhui saw Chu Feng, he immediately rushed forward excitedly and gave Chu Feng a tight hug to greet him.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I missed you to death!&rdquo;<br>Perhaps it was out of agitation, Kong Tianhui actually began crying out loud while hugging Chu Feng.<br>While the others had smiles on their faces, this fellow had his face laden with tears and snot as he bawled his heart out.<br>&ldquo;Brother Kong, must you really do this? Those who don&rsquo;t know better might think that I owe you money!&rdquo;<br>While Chu Feng spoke with slightly disdainful words, his hands were already patting Kong Tianhui&rsquo;s shoulders to comfort this friend of his.<br>He hadn&rsquo;t gone through much with Kong Tianhui, but Chu Feng knew that Kong Tianhui was a warm-hearted and sentimental person. Such a person made extremely good brothers, and Chu Feng had long considered the latter as his close friend too.<br>&ldquo;Hehe, my apologies. I simply missed you too much that I lost control of myself. You need not worry, Brother Chu Feng. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with my sexual orientation!&rdquo; Kong Tianhui declared with a proud smile while wiping away his snot and tears.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really glad to be able to see all of you here. Right, Brother Kong, shouldn&rsquo;t I give a hug to the Flowers of the Three Cities too?&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he shot a glance at Kong Ci, Long Ning and Xian Yun.<br>Xian Yun lowered her head silently, but her face had already reddened from the remark.<br>As for Kong Ci and Long Ning, a wide smile broke out on their lips as they charged straight toward Chu Feng like furious bulls.<br>Those two lasses were really intending to hug Chu Feng, but who could have thought that Chu Feng would suddenly twist his body around and dodge them.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha, I was just joking!&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked with a smile.<br>However, Long Ning suddenly morphed into a streak of light and darted straight into Chu Feng&rsquo;s embrace, hugging him tightly.<br>Kong Ci quickly followed suit and leaped into Chu Feng&rsquo;s embrace too.<br>&ldquo;Heh, a joke is only fun when there&rsquo;s a response. Since you have already made a joke, it&rsquo;s only right for us to play along with you!&rdquo; Long Ning told Chu Feng with a chuckle.<br>&ldquo;Little sister Long, that isn&rsquo;t fair. I want a hug too!&rdquo; Kong Tianhui cried out indignantly as he leaped over too.<br>&ldquo;Ah! Get lost!&rdquo;<br>Long Ning immediately ran off.<br>&ldquo;Why are you dodging! Didn&rsquo;t you say that a joke is only fun when there&rsquo;s a response? Can&rsquo;t you take a joke at all?&rdquo; Kong Tianhui chased after Long Ning, not giving up at all.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>It was then that a voice sounded outside the door.<br>Chu Feng turned his head over and saw two young men standing before the door.<br>They were the young masters of the Wuming Clan, Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo. They were both the sons of Wuming Doutian.<br>It was said that Wuming Doutian used to be the master of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, and he had some conflicts with Chu Feng&rsquo;s father and grandfather.<br>However, the conflict from the past generation didn&rsquo;t affect the relationship Chu Feng had with the both of them. On the contrary, back then, when Chu Feng had a chance to kill Wuming Doutian, he chose to hold back in view of his relationship with the two of them.<br>&ldquo;Brother Yuanzhi, Brother Xiongmo, you&rsquo;re here too!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was delighted to see the two of them around.<br>However, compared to the overjoyed Chu Feng, Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo seemed a little more subdued, as if there were some words stifled in their chests that they couldn&rsquo;t bring themselves to say.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, actually&hellip; we aren&rsquo;t the only ones here.&rdquo;<br>In the end, it was Wuming Xiongmo who spoke up.<br>&ldquo;I know. Your father is here too,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied calmly.<br>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo were a little surprised.<br>It was then another voice sounded by the doorway.<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that young friend Chu Feng is not the same person he used to be? His spirit power is far stronger than what it used to be, so how could he possibly not sense our arrival?&rdquo;<br>It was then that another figure stood into the palace&mdash;Long Daozhi.<br>Compared to Wuming Yuanzhi, Kong Tianhui, and the others, Chu Feng had met Long Daozhi not too long ago, and they had gone through quite a bit together back then.<br>As such, Long Daozhi was well aware that Chu Feng was much stronger than how he was before, having made significant advancements in his cultivation since he last fought with Wuming Doutian.<br>There was another person standing behind Long Daozhi at the moment, and he was the previous overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, as well as the culprit who had forced Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandfather and father away back then&mdash;Wuming Doutian.<br>It was just that this powerhouse who had once stood at the very peak of the Ancestral martial Starfield, striking deep fear into the heart of the Chu Heavenly Clan, was now standing meekly before Chu Feng.<br>Everyone present appeared to be aware of the grudges between Wuming Doutian and the Chu Heavenly Clan, such that as soon as Wuming Doutian appeared, even the excited Kong Tianhui had reined himself in and shut his mouth.<br>All of a sudden, the bustling atmosphere fell extremely silent and heavy.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, young friend Chu Feng. I broke the promise I made to you back then. If you wish to punish me, I&rsquo;ll willing accept anything that you deal to me.&rdquo;<br>Wuming Doutian took a few steps forward before bowing deeply to Chu Feng.<br>Previously, when Chu Feng defeated Wuming Doutian, he warned Wuming Doutian to never abuse his power, and he made the latter swear to confine himself to the Starfield Master Realm, never to leave its premises.<br>Yet, the fact that he was here in the Ancestral Martial Dragon City at this very moment meant that he had broken his promise.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I was the one who invited Brother Wuming here. Are you able to&hellip;&rdquo; Long Daozhi spoke up, intending to plead on Wuming Doutian&rsquo;s behalf.<br>However, how could have thought that Chu Feng would suddenly smile at this moment.<br>&ldquo;I said that it&rsquo;ll be fine as long as the Wuming Clan doesn&rsquo;t oppress the populace of the Ancestral Martial Starfield in the future. After all, Brother Yuanzhi and Brother Xiongmo are my friends, so I can&rsquo;t possibly restrict their freedom.&rdquo;<br>Those words made the anxious Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo heaved a deep sigh of relief. A smile also finally broke out on their nervous faces.<br>With the gathering of old acquaintances, it was inevitable that they would start reminiscing the past together.<br>Some time later, Chu Feng took out the painting and passed it to Long Daozhi, hoping to see if the latter knew the place depicted on the painting.<br>However, it turned out that neither Long Daozhi nor Wuming Doutian recognized the place on the painting at all.<br></p></div>
