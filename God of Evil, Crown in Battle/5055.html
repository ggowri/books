        <h1>Chapter 5054</h1>
        <div>: Unqualified<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;<br>Wang Yuxian was astonished to see so many gazes on her, especially from the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. She had heard the story about how the lord worshiped by the Monstrous Spirit Clan was waiting for someone, but how could she possibly be the person he was waiting for?<br>Tens of thousands of years had passed since then, so there was no way she could have been related to the lord.<br>&ldquo;Miss Wang, you don&rsquo;t need to feel pressured. It&rsquo;s just that the lord is an important benefactor of our Monstrous Spirit Clan. Back when he first arrived at the Monstrous Spirit Clan, he told our ancestors that he was waiting for someone, just that he never got to meet that person in his lifetime.<br>&ldquo;This talent assessment formation was left by him, so we thought that it might have something to do with the person he was waiting for. Countless of our juniors have stepped onto the talent assessment formation over the past tens of thousands of years, but you&rsquo;re the first one to induce a reaction from the lord&rsquo;s pendant.<br>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t have known that such a reaction was possible if not for you. That&rsquo;s why we wondered whether you might just be the person whom the lord has been waiting for all this time,&rdquo; the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief patiently explained the situation to Wang Yuxian.<br>&ldquo;Elder, is there anything I would have to do if I was the person whom your lord is waiting for?&rdquo; Wang Yuxian asked.<br>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t need to do anything at all. To be honest, we have no idea why the lord was waiting for someone. Of course, we aren&rsquo;t able to confirm whether you&rsquo;re truly the person whom the lord was waiting for either. It&rsquo;s just speculation on our part due to the pendant&rsquo;s reaction,&rdquo; the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief explained.<br>She paused for a moment before continuing on, &ldquo;Miss Wang, you must be here for the power the lord has left with us?&rdquo;<br>Instead of answering right away, Wang Yuxian turned to look at Yao Cheng.<br>&ldquo;You should answer our clan chief honestly,&rdquo; Yao Cheng said.<br>So, Wang Yuxian told the clan chief about the reason why she and Chu Feng had come here. However, the faces of the crowd darkened upon hearing her story, including the clan chief. The atmosphere started turning weird.<br>This left Wang Yuxian and Chu Feng feeling a little nervous.<br>They could tell that the Monstrous Spirit Clan was hostile toward outsiders from how the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had made a move on them without allowing them to explain themselves.<br>It was unlikely that they would allow them to borrow the puppet army to save the cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy.<br>After a moment of silence, the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked, &ldquo;Miss Wang, are you intending to save the Nine Souls Sacred Clan or the Nine Souls Galaxy?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m seeking to save the cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy. Elder, you&rsquo;re still a part of our Nine Souls Galaxy even though you have gone into seclusion for tens of thousands of years. Surely you wouldn&rsquo;t want to see the people of our Nine Souls Galaxy get slaughtered by the hands of outsiders?&rdquo;<br>Wang Yuxian tried to persuade the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief with a gentle voice.<br>&ldquo;The Nine Souls Sacred Clan should be thankful that we haven&rsquo;t made a move on them thus far. There&rsquo;s no way we&rsquo;ll help them, or else we&rsquo;ll be letting our dead ancestors down. As for the cultivators of the Nine Souls Galaxy, they have already forgotten about our existence. Their life and death have nothing to do with us,&rdquo; the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>Chu Feng and Wang Yuxian felt their hearts clenching up.<br>They had known that it was possible that the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief might reject their request for help, but it still put them in a tough position. Without the approval of the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, they wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to challenge the puppet army formation, let alone control the puppet army.<br>However, before they could continue persuading her, the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief continued, &ldquo;But Miss Wang, regardless of whether you&rsquo;re the person whom the lord is waiting for, it&rsquo;s a fact that your talent has lit up the &lsquo;Upper&rsquo; character stone tablet and induced a reaction from the lord&rsquo;s pendant. That means to say that you&rsquo;re a person who has been acknowledged by the lord.<br>&ldquo;The energy our clan has is a gift from the lord. While the puppet army was created by the guest from eight hundred years ago, it was done using the lord&rsquo;s energy. Naturally, this means that you can take the puppet army away with you if you wish to.&rdquo;<br>The Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief took out a spirit formation key and opened a massive spirit formation gate. It looked even more imposing than the spirit formation gate leading into the Monstrous Spirit Clan.<br>&ldquo;The puppet army and the formation is in there. Only a person who has cleared the formation will be able to control the puppet army,&rdquo; the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>Wang Yuxian was overjoyed to hear that. She thought that it would have taken a lot more persuasion for her to convince the Monstrous Spirit Clan to help them, but the latter acceded to her request much easier than she had thought.<br>Yao Cheng was right. As long as they could trigger the &lsquo;Upper&rsquo; character stone tablet, the Monstrous Spirit Clan would regard them as esteemed guests.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, elder.&rdquo;<br>Wang Yuxian first thanked the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief before turning to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment!&rdquo;<br>Before the two of them could move, the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief suddenly spoke up.<br>&ldquo;Miss Wang, you may enter the spirit formation gate, but I&rsquo;m afraid that he doesn&rsquo;t have the qualification to do so.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Elder, Chu Feng is a good friend of mine, and his talent is above mine. Would you allow him to accompany me?&rdquo; Wang Yuxian pleaded.<br>&ldquo;Miss Wang, haven&rsquo;t you seen his result on the talent assessment formation? His talent is beneath that of our juniors. He hasn&rsquo;t proven himself worthy to enter the spirit formation gate,&rdquo; the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, I can vouch for Miss Wang&rsquo;s words. Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent is indeed top-notch. That can be easily seen from his cultivation. Despite his young age, he has already reached rank four Martial Exalted level. In fact, he could even put up a fight against a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator,&rdquo; Yao Cheng quickly spoke up too.<br>&ldquo;Yao Cheng, what nonsense are you speaking? There&rsquo;s no way a rank four Martial Exalted level cultivator could possibly go against a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator. You&rsquo;re uttering nonsense here!&rdquo;<br>Yao Cheng&rsquo;s words were immediately met with jeers from the other members of the Monstrous Spirit Clan.<br>&ldquo;Yao Cheng, I&rsquo;m speaking to Miss Wang here. You should stay out of this.&rdquo;<br>The Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief directed a cold gaze toward Yao Cheng. She didn&rsquo;t think well of what Yao Cheng did even though Wang Yuxian had already proven herself in the talent assessment formation.<br>&ldquo;Elder, Elder Yao Cheng isn&rsquo;t lying. Chu Feng is really&hellip;&rdquo; Wang Yuxian quickly spoke up on Chu Feng&rsquo;s behalf.<br>She knew that she was the one who currently held the most say amongst them. If anyone could persuade the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, it was her.<br>&ldquo;Miss Wang, please don&rsquo;t put me in a spot.&rdquo;<br>However, the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief held steadfast to her stance. She even directed a polite bow toward Wang Yuxian, making it clear that she didn&rsquo;t want to discuss this any further.<br></p></div>
