        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;Chengyu, do you believe in prophecies?&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s often said that it&rsquo;s nigh impossible to go against divine providence, but I believe that fate lies in one&rsquo;s hands. I refuse to believe that a man can rise to the top without putting in hard work just because he is chosen by the world. Take me for example, I might be respected by others now, but I know that it&rsquo;s only because I have your and the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s backing. If I don&rsquo;t work hard on my cultivation, I&rsquo;d be nothing without you and the clan. Even if I&rsquo;m blessed with a good background, it&rsquo;ll be futile if I can&rsquo;t carry my own weight,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>He chose to indirectly answer his father&rsquo;s question.</span><br><span>&ldquo;As expected of my son! It&rsquo;s the blessing of our Totem Dragon Clan that you think that way!&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Even though I don&rsquo;t think that prophecy is reliable, I still think that it&rsquo;d be beneficial to our clan to befriend Chu Feng. Just with his current growth trajectory, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before he makes a name for himself in the world of cultivation,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That child is both talented and sentimental. That can be seen as much from how Muxi regards him so highly. The happenings in the God Taboo Battlefield only further drive that in,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Father, are you willing to offer him protection?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We should befriend him, but we shouldn&rsquo;t be too protective of him. You have to remember that our clan has its own enemies too. It&rsquo;d be to his detriment if we put him too high of a pedestal too early on,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Long Chengyu replied with a nod.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chengyu, have you heard about Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er?&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I did. She recently left her name on the Immemorial Star Sea&rsquo;s stone monument. I thought that the Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s future is already bright enough with Xianhai Shaoyu around, but who could have thought that his little sister is equally frightening? It looks like the Immortal Sea Fish Clan is well-positioned for God&rsquo;s Era,&rdquo; Long Chengyu remarked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you interested in meeting Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er?&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What do you mean, father?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked with an expectant look on his face.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha! Look at your gleaming eyes! It isn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;re thinking. You don&rsquo;t know how protective the Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief is of his precious daughter! The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect and Divine Body Heavenly Mansion have already tried proposing to take her hand in marriage, but they were rejected on the grounds that she&rsquo;s still too young. In fact, I heard that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, who is known to never engage in political marriages, is also eyeing her too!&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only normal for them to be interested in her given her talent. They claim that they don&rsquo;t do political marriages to avoid diluting their bloodline, but the truth is that they look down on us. That bunch of world spiritists really think that they are the overlords of the world of cultivation, but the strongest junior isn&rsquo;t even their world spiritist! One day, they will come to understand it&rsquo;s called the world of cultivation instead of the world of world spiritists!&rdquo; Long Chengyu sneered.</span><br><span>He then turned to the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and asked, &ldquo;Father, why did you </span><span>ask me if I&rsquo;m interested in meeting Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Chengyu was curious about Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I plan to bring you to the Immemorial Star Sea to take a look. You might just be able to meet her if fate permits,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said with a chuckle.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just lifting my expectations for no reason,&rdquo; Long Chengyu grumbled as his excitement vanished without a trace. &ldquo;Why do you want to go to the Immemorial Star Sea?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I need to deal with some matters there, but I&rsquo;m still hesitating as to whether I should bring Chu Feng along,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you need Chu Feng&rsquo;s help?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master asked me for a favor. He requested a junior with a powerful bloodline from our Totem Dragon Clan. Furthermore, this matter has to be kept confidential from the other powers,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re working with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master? Father, what is the favor about?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the details yet, but I&rsquo;m thinking that Chu Feng should be able to offer some help if it&rsquo;s a place where only juniors can enter,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Will the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master be there too?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He should already be there,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Father, I recommend that we bring Chu Feng there too. If you saw with your own eyes what happened in the God Taboo Battlefield, you would know how formidable he is. Let me put it in this way. There are only two juniors whom I&rsquo;d willingly concede to. One is Xianhai Shaoyu, and the other is Chu Feng,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll bring Chu Feng with us. However, you mustn&rsquo;t tell him the details of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s involvement yet. This matter must be kept confidential. I should first ask the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master whether he&rsquo;s fine with us bringing Chu Feng along. If he refuses, we&rsquo;ll just exclude Chu Feng from the operation,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s injuries from the God Taboo Battlefield were worse than expected, causing him to remain unconscious for a long time. He woke up alone on a bed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awake, Chu Feng. I told you not to go that far. Why didn&rsquo;t you listen to me?&rdquo;</span><br><span>He heard Eggy&rsquo;s voice as soon as he opened his eyes.</span><br><span>Eggy had tried dissuading him when he decided to activate the formation all by himself, but he refused to listen to her despite knowing that he would pay a price for it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Go easy on me, I&rsquo;m a patient. Somehow&hellip; I feel like there&rsquo;s a strong surge of energy inside me. Let me take a look.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng inspected his body and found that a huge amount of medicinal energy accumulated inside him. He hurriedly channeled his cultivation skill to convert it into his own power and store it in his dantian.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It looks like the Totem Dragon Clan fed me some good stuff to help me recover. Who could have thought I would wake up to find my body healthier than it previously was? It even gave me an impetus for a breakthrough!&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;They should! You helped them acquire a God Taboo Martial Skill, one that is likely to be highly valuable at that!&rdquo; Eggy crossed her arms and snorted. She thought that Chu Feng was making a loss.</span><br><span>&ldquo;To tell you the truth, my goal was actually not to acquire the God Taboo Martial Skill. I was planning to use the power of the sculptures to take a better look at the God Taboo Battlefield,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Did you notice anything then?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I did. The God Taboo Battlefield is humongous; the area we could see was only the tip of the iceberg. I couldn&rsquo;t peer into its deepest regions, but I&rsquo;m sure there were more treasures beyond our wildest imagination there. There might even be other existences there. The God Taboo Battlefield gave me an unfathomable feeling similar to the Heavenly Sacred Temple,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is the God Taboo Battlefield that formidable?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are we on a warship?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng suddenly leaped off the bed and looked outside. He noticed that he was on a warship and was in the midst of traveling through an ancient teleportation formation.</span><br></p></div>
