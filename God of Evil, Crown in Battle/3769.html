        <h1>Chapter 3768</h1>
        <div> - Dangerous Being<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;The Tantai Heavenly Clan has been massacred? When did that happen?&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked at practically the same time.<br>Their faces were filled with shock as they said those words.<br>After all, that was a major event.<br>&ldquo;Right before I came here. However, it seemed like all the strong individuals of the Tantai Heavenly Clan had left. It could be said that they&rsquo;ve dodged a calamity. That said, the people that remained in the Tantai Heavenly Clan were all killed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Regardless of their age or gender, including even the pets and ferocious beasts that the Tantai Heavenly Clan kept, everyone was killed,&rdquo; said Bai Liluo.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, even Chu Feng felt astonished.<br>From Bai Liluo&rsquo;s words, he was capable of imagining what sort of sight the Tantai Heavenly Clan was left in.<br>It would truly be a field of corpses, a river of blood, an appalling scene of devastation.<br>Chu Feng had been to the Tantai Heavenly Clan before. Thus, he knew what it looked like.<br>They were a power second only to the Linghu Heavenly Clan in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Not only were they strong and possessed of a great amount of resources, but they also had a great number of clansmen.<br>The number of Tantai Heavenly Clansmen numbered in the several tens of millions.<br>Although the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had brought their elites to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the elites composed only a small portion of the Tantai Heavenly Clansmen.<br>Thus, even though the Tantai Heavenly Clan had managed to keep their most outstanding elites alive, the countless people that had died were all their relatives. Chu Feng felt that this would definitely be an enormous shock to the Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>That said, the Tantai Heavenly Clan could still be said to be enormously fortunate in this great disaster.<br>If those elites hadn&rsquo;t travelled to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they would likely have been killed by the Black-feathered Specter too.<br>With that, the Tantai Heavenly Clan would truly have disappeared from the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>That said, Chu Feng was still unable to help but gasp at how ruthless the Black-feathered Specter was.<br>What it had done was truly a massacre.<br>&ldquo;Is the Black-feathered Specter still in the Tantai Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>This question concerned the future of the Tantai Heavenly Clan. If the Black-feathered Specter was still in the Tantai Heavenly Clan, the elites of the Tantai Heavenly Clan would definitely meet their deaths upon their return.<br>&ldquo;It left. Merely, I do not know where it went," said Bai Liluo.<br>Hearing those words, Grandmaster Liangqiu heaved a sigh of relief.<br>There was no grievance between him and the Tantai Heavenly Clan. Thus, he did not wish for them to be completely exterminated.<br>That said, although he had heaved a sigh of relief, he was still greatly concerned.<br>After all, as long as the Black-feathered Specter was still present, the Tantai Heavenly Clan would forever live under its shadow.<br>&ldquo;Why did that Black-feathered Specter deliberately allow itself to be captured by the Tantai Heavenly Clan back then?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;To absorb the power of that formation,&rdquo; said Bai Liluo.<br>Chu Feng was not surprised at her answer. After all, he had warned the Tantai Heavenly Clan and told them that the Black-feathered Specter was deliberately allowing itself to be captured. Merely, the Tantai Heavenly Clan did not believe him.<br>Back then, Chu Feng had thought of a lot of reasons as to why the Black-feathered Specter would deliberately allow itself to be captured. He had also guessed that it might be doing so to absorb the power of that formation.<br>&ldquo;In that case, big sister Liluo, how did you manage to escape from its body?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Although Chu Feng had not truly witnessed the power of the Black-feathered Specter, he was able to imagine how powerful it was. He knew that its power must be extremely terrifying, and might be something that no one in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield could contend against.<br>Precisely because the Black-feathered Specter was so powerful, Chu Feng felt that it was a miracle that Bai Liluo was able to escape from its body.<br>&ldquo;You can say that it spared me. After all, it is thanks to me that it was able to awaken," said Bai Liluo.<br>&ldquo;Thanks to you? What do you mean?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng and others were all very curious upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;Back then, when I was in the Tantai Heavenly Clan, for the sake of helping you obtain good achievements in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars, I deliberately left that letter and forged the Black-feathered Specter&rsquo;s feather. I did that so that you all would think that I was captured by the Black-feathered Specter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, at that time, I felt a very terrifying power lying dormant in the Tantai Heavenly Clan. Curious, I went to investigate. However, before I could approach it, that thing awakened. Not only that, but it even devoured me," said Bai Liluo.<br>&ldquo;That was the Black-feathered Specter?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said Bai Liluo.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, if that&rsquo;s the case, you&rsquo;ve created a massive calamity.&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu had a slightly blaming look on his face as he said those words.<br>His reaction was understandable. If the Black-feathered Specter didn&rsquo;t wake up, the Tantai Heavenly Clan wouldn&rsquo;t have been exterminated by it. All those innocent people would not have died.<br>Besides, the awakening of a monster like the Black-feathered Specter was definitely grievous news to the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>&ldquo;Even if I didn&rsquo;t approach it, it would also have awoken on its own. I merely made it awaken a bit sooner," refuted Bai Liluo.<br>The crowd found themselves unable to refute her words.<br>Indeed, the Black-feathered Specter was filled with unknowns to begin with. It was an existence that surpassed their understanding.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, in that case, how did you manage to sense the existence of the Black-feathered Specter?&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan asked curiously.<br>According to Bai Liluo, the Black-feathered Specter should&rsquo;ve been in the Tantai Heavenly Clan the entire time.<br>However, the Black-feathered Specter had disappeared for many years without the Tantai Heavenly Clan being able to detect it. Yet, Bai Liluo was able to detect it.<br>This made the crowd realize that she might possess some sort of special detection power.<br>&ldquo;My power is simply not something that you humans could compare to.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For example, there is also a very dangerous thing inside this Chu Heavenly Clan. You all are unable to sense it, no?&rdquo;<br>As Bai Liluo said those words, she took a glance at Grandmaster Liangqiu, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Gu Mingyuan. Not only did she have a very pleased look on her face, but there was also a trace of contempt in her eyes.<br>Hearing Bai Liluo&rsquo;s words, the crowd simply had no heart to concern themselves with the contempt in her eyes as she looked at them. The reason for that was because their hearts had tensed up upon hearing her words.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, you cannot make that sort of joke," the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said with a smile. However, that smile of his was a bit stiff.<br>He was afraid that she was not joking around. If she wasn&rsquo;t joking around, it would be an enormously bad thing.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not joking. I&rsquo;m serious. You had all best drive it away. Otherwise&hellip; it will cause no end of trouble,&rdquo; said Bai Liluo.<br>&ldquo;Big sister Liluo, what is &lsquo;it&rsquo; that you&rsquo;re referring to?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng asked with a serious look on his face.<br>He was able to tell that Bai Liluo was not joking.<br>In fact, it was not only Chu Feng who became serious. The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Grandmaster Liangqiu and even Gu Mingyuan all turned serious.<br>The reason for that was because they were able to infer from Bai Liluo&rsquo;s words that the dangerous existence was something that none of them could handle.<br>Otherwise, she would&rsquo;ve told them to kill it, and not simply drive it away.<br>&ldquo;I am unable to be certain of what it might be,&rdquo; said Bai Liluo.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, where is that thing?&rdquo; asked the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan CHief.<br>&ldquo;In there,&rdquo; said Bai Liluo.<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; The crowd were all deeply startled upon hearing her words.<br>The reason for that was because the location Bai Liluo was pointing to was the place where Chu Feng had just come from.<br>Imprisoned in that place was the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master and the other experts.<br></p></div>
