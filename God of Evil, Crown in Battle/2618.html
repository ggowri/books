        <div> - Blinded By Greed<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Is this that Demon Armament? It is truly extraordinary.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Chu Feng, listen to my advice. Even if you have a Demon Armament, it is best that you do not attack me, for it will be impossible for you to match me,&rdquo; The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled coldly. He started to grip the Evil God Sword even tighter.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, stop,&rdquo; Right at this moment, Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s voice suddenly sounded.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do not be this rash. It will not be too late for you to kill him after you become a True Immortal. After all, you&rsquo;ve already obtained the method to become a True Immortal.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There is no need for you to utilize the Evil God Sword. You know very well the power of that Evil God Sword. If you are to fail in controlling it, not only will you die, but everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm will die,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>After hearing what Her Lady Queen said, Chu Feng slowly lowered his raised Evil God Sword.<br>What Her Lady Queen said was reasonable. Chu Feng was simply unable to control the Evil God Sword. Unless absolutely necessary, it would be best to not use it.<br>After lowering his sword, Chu Feng turned around and started to inspect Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s injuries.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had lowered his Evil God Sword, the complacent expression on the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster grew even stronger.<br>He felt that Chu Feng had lowered his Evil God Sword because he was scared.<br>However, Chu Feng simply did not concern himself with how others viewed him. The only thing he cared about right now was Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s injuries.<br>&ldquo;Senior Zi, don&rsquo;t worry, Senior Ying&rsquo;s injuries can be cured,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Zi Xunyi.<br>&ldquo;Truly?&rdquo; Zi Xunyi was extremely vexed by Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s injury. However, after hearing what Chu Feng said, she reacted as if she had seen hope.<br>&ldquo;I will need your help,&rdquo; After that, Chu Feng taught Zi Xunyi the method to set up a spirit formation.<br>That spirit formation was not an ordinary healing formation. Instead, it was a spirit formation that specialized in removing demonic energy. It was extremely effective toward Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s injuries.<br>The reason for that was because Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s injuries were not simple physical injuries. Rather, his body was invaded by demonic energy.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, you have all witnessed my strength. Thus, I wish to ask everyone a question. If I wanted to kill you all now, who could possibly escape from me?&rdquo; The Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the hearts of the crowd all tensed up. With the strength that the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster possessed, it would indeed be extremely easy for him to kill them.<br>This was especially true when they saw the dark black gaseous flames that were still surging about in the sky. They discovered that, at this moment, they were akin to having sharp blades pointed at their throats.<br>As long as the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster willed it, all of them would be killed. After all, even the strongest among them, Ying Mingchao, was no match for the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster. Thus, how could they possibly contend against the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster?<br>&ldquo;Everyone, there&rsquo;s no need to be scared. Although I possess the ability to kill all of you, I will not kill a single person.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because our Infant Soul Sect never thought about killing innocents. There has only ever been one goal since the founding of our Infant Soul Sect. That is, we want to benefit everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, we want to benefit all of you,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, could it be&hellip; that you&rsquo;re really willing to help us increase our cultivation?&rdquo;<br>At this moment, many people started to believe in the words spoken by the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster. They felt that there was no reason for him to lie to them.<br>After all, if the Infant Soul Sect really was a demonic sect, they could very well kill them all at this moment. There was no need for them to deceive them.<br>Furthermore, they had personally witnessed the power of the Infant Soul Grand Formation. It was truly a grand formation capable of helping them increase their cultivation.<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster spoke frankly.<br>&ldquo;In that case, Lord Sectmaster, could you use that Infant Soul Grand Formation to help us increase our cultivation right now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, if you are able to help me increase my cultivation, I am willing to join the Infant Soul Sect and pledge my life to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Sectmaster, please impart strength upon me. I am willing to work for it with my life.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, countless people began to plead for the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster to help them increase their cultivation. They were willing to give up their lives for the sake of increasing their cultivations.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, there&rsquo;s no need to be impatient. Everyone in our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm will be able to increase their cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I have a small request,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>Right after he said those words, Chu Feng cast his sharp gaze toward the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster.<br>&ldquo;The fox is finally going to reveal his fox tail?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>Like Chu Feng, Her Lady Queen felt that it would be impossible for the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster to help everyone increase their cultivation for free.<br>In fact, they simply did not believe that the Infant Soul Sect would really be able to help the crowd increase their cultivation.<br>There was most definitely a goal, a reason why the Infant Soul Sect was fabricating this lie. However, regardless of what their goal might be, it was most definitely not good.<br>Thus, Chu Feng and Her Lady Queen wanted to know exactly what the Infant Soul Sect was planning for them to go through great pains to fabricate this lie.<br>However, the others were simply not thinking like Chu Feng and Her Lady Queen. They were all thinking that the Infant Soul Sect was truly planning to help them.<br>At this moment, the crowd all began to voice their acceptance of the request. Even though the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster had not yet indicated to them what sort of request it was, they were already accepting the request. It was as if they were willing to do anything.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, the task is actually very simple. I merely need to trouble everyone to spread this matter out to every nook and corner of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm so that everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm will know of this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Then, I ask those that have the strength to help bring those that are weak here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I hope that everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm will be able to obtain the assistance of the Infant Soul Grand Formation when it is next activated,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;Is that all that you need? Rest assured, we will definitely accomplish that and have everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm obtain your assistance,&rdquo; the crowd accepted the request immediately. They did not have the slightest hesitation toward this sort of request.<br>&ldquo;This old monk wishes to ask, if the Infant Soul Grand Formation is of use to those that have reached the True Immortal realm?&rdquo; The Abbot of the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple asked.<br>&ldquo;This Infant Soul Grand Formation is capable of benefiting everyone. Merely, as everyone possesses different levels of talent, the benefits that they obtain will also be different.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, without a doubt, everyone will be able to obtain benefits from it. Everyone&rsquo;s cultivation will increase.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let me reemphasize it. By &lsquo;everyone&rsquo;, True Immortals are naturally also included.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, it might not be possible to increase the cultivation of those that have reached the True Immortal realm. However, they will be able to obtain enormous profit that could serve as a foundation for increasing their cultivation in the future,&rdquo; the Infant Soul Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said.<br>&ldquo;Very well, our Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple will help you,&rdquo; the Abbot of the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple said.<br>After that, the Immortal Sword School&rsquo;s Headmaster also agreed to help.<br>These two tier one powers that were originally allied with Hero City and had come here to eradicate the Infant Soul Sect, for the sake of increasing their own cultivation, now stood on the side of the Infant Soul Sect and agreed to help them.<br><br></p></div>
