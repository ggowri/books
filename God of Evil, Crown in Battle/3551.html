        <h1>Chapter 3550</h1>
        <div> - Under The Same Cultivation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outside the Starfall Holy Stone. The experts from both the Starfall Holy Land and the Ghost Sect Hall were all tied up by the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen.<br>This made the experts from the Starfall Holy Land and the Ghost Sect Hall very furious. It would be one thing for them to be tied up elsewhere. However, this was the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>One must know that they were top existences in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Never had they received such humiliation before.<br>That said, what gave them the most despair was that they were not only being humiliated, but would very likely end up dead too.<br>After all, those people were the demented Blood-devouring Demon Clan.<br>&ldquo;Hey hey hey, no matter what, you guys are people from a demonic clan that has existed for tens of thousands of years. Is this how you treat the experts of our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm? You people are simply too lacking in manners, no?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice was heard.<br>The sudden voice caught everyone&rsquo;s attention.<br>The experts from the Starfall Holy Land, the Ghost Sect Hall and even the Blood-devouring Demon Clan all turned their eyes toward the direction of the voice.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing the person who had arrived, the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s jaw immediately dropped, revealing a complicated expression of astonishment and concern.<br>He was someone who thought very highly of Chu Feng. However, he did not wish to see Chu Feng there. Yet, he had just so happened to appear there of all places.<br>&ldquo;Senior Hall Master, it&rsquo;s been a long time,&rdquo; compared to the worried Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, Chu Feng was very calm and composed. He even smiled and waved at the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;He is Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, Chu Feng?&rdquo; At that moment, the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master also looked to Chu Feng with a complicated expression.<br>He had actually seen Chu Feng&rsquo;s portrait and heard of his accomplishments. That said, it was still the first time that he was seeing him in the flesh.<br>&ldquo;Greetings, senior Holy Master,&rdquo; out of courtesy, Chu Feng clasped his fist at the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master. Not only were his manners very good, but he was also very relaxed.<br>However, it was precisely Chu Feng&rsquo;s relaxed behavior that caused the crowd to feel so confused.<br>&ldquo;What is that guy doing? Has he gone insane?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the all-smiles and no worry Chu Feng, Song Yunfei and the various Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s younger generations were completely confused.<br>There were even people that wondered if he had turned stupid, and was unable to see how bad the situation at hand was.<br>In fact, they, the people of the younger generation, were not the only ones confused by Chu Feng&rsquo;s behavior. Even the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master and the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master were equally confused.<br>They did not understand how Chu Feng could be so calm. However, they knew what sort of danger he would find himself in.<br>Thus, they were already sending voice transmissions to Chu Feng, urging him to run away.<br>However, Chu Feng was acting as if he could not hear their voice transmissions. Not only did he not respond to them, but he even looked to the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s eighteen Exalted-level experts.<br>The gaze that he was looking at them with was even slightly provocative.<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s provocative gaze, the experts of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan were flabbergasted. They even began to wonder if the brat before them had some sort of problem with his eyes, and wonder if that was just the way he looked at people.<br>Otherwise, how could a brat like that dare to look at them in such a manner?<br>To their surprise, at the moment when they were reassuring themselves, Chu Feng suddenly spoke, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you all this. Immediately release those seniors.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s words shocked the crowd completely.<br>Even the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen did not dare to believe their ears.<br>&ldquo;You just told us to release them? Am I mishearing things?&rdquo; A Blood-devouring Demon Clansman that seemed to be the leader of the bunch asked Chu Feng.<br>His tone was extremely vile and threatening. He seemed to be warning Chu Feng to be careful in his response, because if he was displeased by it, he would teach him a lesson.<br>Had it been someone else, they would not only be scared speechless, but they would likely even be thinking about kneeling on the ground.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s behavior contradicted the norm completely. Not only did he refuse to give face, but he even revealed a look of annoyance. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Do you want me to repeat myself?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Insolent trash, you dare to speak to our clan&rsquo;s lord with such a tone? Kneel immediately!&rdquo;<br>Faced with Chu Feng&rsquo;s provocative behavior, an expert from the Blood-devouring Demon Clan burst forth with rage.<br>Angrily, his peak Martial Immortal aura swept straight toward Chu Feng.<br>He was planning to use his oppressive might to force Chu Feng to his knees.<br>However, after he unleashed his oppressive might, the surroundings entered a state of silence.<br>The crowd looked to one another with confusion on their faces. The Blood-devouring Demon Clansman that had unleashed his oppressive might earlier was standing there completely dazed.<br>His oppressive might had clearly surrounded Chu Feng. Yet, he was completely unharmed. Not to mention forcing him to kneel, not even a single strand of his hair was moved by the oppressive might.<br>Chu Feng sighed, &ldquo;You are all truly incapable of telling what&rsquo;s good for yourselves. Must you force me to act in order to release them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>After his words left his mouth, a Divine character made of lightning appeared on his forehead.<br>Then, overwhelming oppressive might swept forth and instantly dominated the surroundings.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, all of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen that were standing in midair lost their ability to fly, and crashed to the ground like fallen leaves.<br>&ldquo;This aura&hellip; could it be?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master, the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, and all the other experts and younger generations present were all dumbfounded.<br>Those from the younger generation were still unable to understand what had just happened. However, the experts had all realized what had just happened. It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng had, by himself, instantly forced all of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s experts to the ground.<br>The reason why he was capable of such a feat was, apart from the Lightning Mark on his forehead, his actual cultivation had reached rank one Exalted.<br>They were all astonished to realize that. Otherwise, they wouldn&rsquo;t have such shocked expressions on their faces.<br>&ldquo;What overwhelming battle power. Those people are simply unable to fight back at all. Young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power is simply too terrifying. Likely, he is unmatched among those of the same cultivation.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had managed to effortlessly subdue all of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen, Elder Xing Yi, who was originally worried for and even feeling guilty about Chu Feng, immediately started to smile. His expression was not merely one of excitement.<br>&ldquo;Elder Xing Yi, you&hellip; you&hellip; what did you mean by what you just said? Amongst those of the same cultivation? But&hellip; aren&rsquo;t there Exalted-level experts among those people?&rdquo;<br>Song Yunfei looked to Elder Xing Yi with a complicated gaze. His flickering eyes were not only filled with skepticism; they were also filled with nervousness and unease.<br></p></div>
