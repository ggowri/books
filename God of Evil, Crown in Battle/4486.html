        <h1>Chapter 4485</h1>
        <div>: Whitesky Star River<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Miaomiao, what are you talking about? How could we possibly think of hurting your friend?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Also, you&rsquo;re thinking too much into the matter regarding your memories. You only lost your memories due to your body being overburdened by the abrupt rise in your cultivation. Neither we nor your mother has ever tried to tamper with your memories. You know how much we dote on you, so how can we possibly do anything that would hurt you?&rdquo;<br>The two Supreme Elders quickly explained.<br>&ldquo;Then why has none of you ever told me that I came from the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm or the Holy Land of Martialism?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao asked.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; Miaomiao, we earnestly believed that your memories of the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm have no benefits to the current you, and that&rsquo;s why we have neglected to mention it,&rdquo; the two Supreme Elders said.<br>&ldquo;My old memories have no benefits to me? And who&rsquo;s the judge that? I can tell you directly that I was much happier in the Holy Land of Martialism than I was here. Who are you to take away my memories? Who are you to take away a part of who I am?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao glared at the two Supreme Elders in fury.<br>Faced with such a Xian Miaomiao, the two Supreme Elders fell silent. They had nothing to say because they knew very well what the truth was.<br>&ldquo;I have no intention of arguing with you over this matter. What&rsquo;s happened has happened, and you can rest assured that I have no intention of pursuing this matter. However, you shouldn&rsquo;t take me for a fool and continue pulling all kinds of things behind my back. I, Xian Miaomiao, mean what I say.<br>&ldquo;If forced to a corner, I&rsquo;ll break away from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan and sever my ties with my mother,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao said.<br>&hellip;<br>Shortly after Xian Miaomiao and the others left, Chu Feng and the others departed from the area too.<br>Many of the onlookers who had seen everything earlier were interested in striking up a relationship with Chu Feng, but Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t interested in bothering with them. Thus, it would be better for them to leave as soon as possible to avoid trouble.<br>While they were on their way back, Chu Feng told the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief about what he had gone through inside the mountain range.<br>However, when it came to the hidden place, he only told them that he had managed to find it, it was more dangerous than he thought, and that he had encountered the Black-White Twin Malevolent in there and they died to one of the traps inside.<br>He decided to keep mum about the other stuff.<br>In any case, the crowd was no longer as interested in the hidden place anymore. What they were more concerned about was how Chu Feng came to know Princess Miaomiao from the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>Regarding this matter, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t go into depth explaining the matter. He simply told them that Xian Miaomiao was an old acquaintance.<br>He also didn&rsquo;t explain how and where they met since he didn&rsquo;t want to bring Xian Miaomiao any possible trouble. While these people were indeed his allies at the moment, his trust in them was still lacking.<br>After all, they had chosen to watch by the side earlier when he and Long Xiaoxiao were faced with danger.<br>Chu Feng could see things from their point of view as well. They were leaders of their respective organizations, and their decisions could easily impact the lives of those under them. Unlike Chu Feng, who had no such burden, they couldn&rsquo;t afford to act recklessly.<br>He chose not a grudge toward them, but this matter still thinned the trust he had in them.<br>There was also one change that Chu Feng noticed after the earlier incident.<br>Other than Long Xiaoxiao, everyone&rsquo;s attitude toward him had become far more deferential than before, almost as if they were scared of him. Even when conversing with him, they would watch their words carefully, fearing that they would unintentionally offend him.<br>It was one thing for the others to treat him in such a manner, but even the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother, and Elder Long Busheng were doing the same too.<br>It was not as if he couldn&rsquo;t understand why they were acting in such a way though. They were all afraid of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, and his relationship with Xian Miaomiao was good enough for her to go to the extent of killing her clan members for him.<br>That served as an example as to what could potentially occur to them if they were to cross Chu Feng.<br>Unknowingly, Chu Feng had already become a figure whom none of the powerhouses of the Holy Light Galaxy dared to offend.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, my apologies. I brought you here with the intention of sharing the treasures with you, but it ended up bringing you such trouble instead. As an apology, allow me to share a hidden cultivation spot with everyone,&rdquo; the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;A hidden cultivation spot?&rdquo;<br>Everyone&rsquo;s interest was piqued, including Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>He was in a rush to raise his cultivation, so he wouldn&rsquo;t miss any opportunities to do so.<br>&ldquo;This place isn&rsquo;t of much use to old fogeys like us, but to juniors like young friend Chu Feng and Miss Long, I believe that it should be of considerable help,&rdquo; the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief!&rdquo;<br>But in the moment that the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said those words, the elders and the juniors of the Yu Heavenly Clan immediately exclaimed in shock.<br>It was apparent that they knew which place the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was talking about, and they weren&rsquo;t too willing to expose it.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;<br>The Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was initially talking about this matter to Chu Feng with a smile, but after being interrupted by his own clan members, his face immediately darkened.<br>&ldquo;N-no, it&rsquo;s nothing&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Faced with the frosty look of their clan chief, those from the Yu Heavenly Clan quickly shut their mouths.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me while I&rsquo;m speaking, understand?&rdquo; the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke sharply.<br>&ldquo;We understand.&rdquo;<br>The crowd from the Yu Heavenly Clan answered with their heads lowered.<br>Seeing how the others from the Yu Heavenly Clan had risked angering their own clan chief in order to avoid the revelation of the cultivation spot, Chu Feng and the others became even more curious about it.<br>&ldquo;Elder, may I ask what kind of place it is?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>The Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief seemed delighted to hear Chu Feng&rsquo;s question. After all, it was due to the latter that he was making such an offer. Otherwise, there was no way he would have been willing to reveal such a precious cultivation spot to the others.<br>It could be said that everyone else was benefiting from Chu Feng&rsquo;s presence.<br>Through the explanation of the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the crowd soon came to understand just what kind of place that cultivation spot was.<br>It was located in the Nine Souls Galaxy too, but it was located at a place named the Whitesky Star River on another starfield.<br>The Whitesky Star River was a river where starlight would occasionally appear in, making it reminiscent of a river of stars. That was how its beautiful name came by.<br>In the depths of the Whitesky Star River, there was a hidden current that harnessed rich natural energies. That was the cultivation spot that the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke of.<br>It was just that only juniors were able to enter this hidden flow of current, and it had to be opened with a special method.<br>Through concentrating the essence of the river, the natural energies gathered in the hidden current would grow stronger with time. Every hundred years, the natural energies in the hidden current would hit its peak and create the optimal condition for cultivators to train in there.<br>The only issue now was that they were still a few years from reaching the next hundredth year.<br>It was for that reason that the others from the Yu Heavenly Clan were a little reluctant when they heard that their clan chief was going to give away this hidden cultivation spot. They were planning to have the juniors head over to the Whitesky Star River to cultivate after it was finally in its optimal state a few years later.<br>This should have been a cultivation spot that was exclusive to the juniors of the Yu Heavenly Clan, but now that the clan chief had shared it with the others, those from the Dragon Clan, Cloudsky Immortal Sect, and Monstrous Herd Temple would surely send their juniors over as well.<br>It was only natural that those from the Yu Heavenly Clan would be upset over this turn of affairs.<br>However, what the others from the Yu Heavenly Clan didn&rsquo;t see was that the clan chief had his own motive for making such a decision.<br>He wanted to make Chu Feng think that he was an open-hearted and generous person who wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to share such valuable resources with him so as to leave the latter with a good impression.<br>He felt that given Chu Feng&rsquo;s standing, influence, and potential, earning a good impression would reap far greater returns than hoarding onto their cultivation resources.<br></p></div>
