        <div> - Truly A Qilin&rsquo;s Egg?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This sudden occurrence had completely startled Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng knew from the very start that the egg in his Cosmos Sack was extraordinary.<br>After all, it was something that he had obtained from the mystic realm of the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram.<br>When Chu Feng had braved the risk to keep the egg, he had already prepared himself for more risks in the future.<br>Merely, he did not expect the egg to react at such a time.<br>If the people from the Tantai Heavenly Clan were to learn that Chu Feng&rsquo;s egg had absorbed the power of their Peach Garden Mystic Realm, they would likely not allow him to leave safely.<br>Suddenly, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er asked loudly, &ldquo;Seniors, what is happening?&rdquo; Once her question was asked, an aged voice could be heard in the Peach Garden Mystic Realm.<br>&ldquo;Xing&rsquo;er, it seems that some sort of gap has appeared in the Peach Garden Mystic Realm. That gap is causing the power within the Peach Garden Mystic Realm to rapidly drain away.&rdquo;<br>Once that voice was heard, Chu Feng and the others immediately knew that experts from the Tantai Heavenly Clan should be able to see the changes within the Peach Garden Mystic Realm.<br>In other words, Chu Feng and the others&rsquo; every action here was being witnessed by people from the Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>However, Chu Feng was not worried about the matter of him entering the cliff, because it seemed that they were unable to observe that matter. Otherwise, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er would not have exposed herself.<br>&ldquo;Gap? How could a gap appear here? Where did that gap come from? Why am I unable to see it?&rdquo; Tantai Xing&rsquo;er looked all around. Her expression was very grave. It could be seen that she was truly panicking.<br>After all, the Peach Garden Mystic Realm was a treasure that was completely controlled by their Tantai Heavenly Clan. If something were to happen to it, their clan would suffer the loss.<br>&ldquo;Xing&rsquo;er, don&rsquo;t panic. Although we are unable to detect where the gap is, we know of a way to remedy it. We are already operating the spirit formation. Soon, things will return to normal.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, although the power that was lost is from the Peach Garden Mystic Realm, the loss of that power will not cause any effect to the Peach Garden Mystic Realm,&rdquo; that old man&rsquo;s voice sounded again.<br>&ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s power from this place, it will definitely have a use. How could there be no effect?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Regardless, quickly return the situation to normal,&rdquo; Tantai Xing&rsquo;er became somewhat annoyed.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured,&rdquo; the old man&rsquo;s reply became slightly humble.<br>Through their conversation, Chu Feng learned that Tantai Xing&rsquo;er held quite a high status within the Tantai Heavenly Clan. Otherwise, she couldn&rsquo;t possibly be able to speak to an elder in such a manner while only being a person of the younger generation.<br>Tantai Xing&rsquo;er had likely truly panicked. In panic, she had exposed her true character. Otherwise, she who had pretended to be a fair, sensible and noble young miss would definitely not speak to her senior with such an attitude.<br>That said, Chu Feng did not care about any of that. What he was concerned about was the fact that Tantai Xing&rsquo;er and the others did not discover that the change to the Peach Garden Mystic Realm was caused by him.<br>This had half-relieved Chu Feng&rsquo;s suspended heart. The reason why it was only half-relieved was because he didn&rsquo;t know if the egg within his Cosmos Sack would create any further unforeseen situations.<br>Thus, Chu Feng hurriedly examined his Cosmos Sack.<br>Upon doing so, he became even more nervous.<br>There was no change to the egg in his Cosmos Sack. In fact, even the spirit formation that he had set up was completely undamaged.<br>Yet, Chu Feng was able to clearly sense that the power that was being drained from the Peach Garden Mystic Realm had entered that egg.<br>This meant that his spirit formation was completely ineffective against the egg. It also indirectly proved to him how extraordinary that egg was.<br>&ldquo;Could it be&hellip; I really obtained a Qilin&rsquo;s egg?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The divine beast Qilin?!!!&rdquo;<br>The reason why Chu Feng felt that way was because the contents of the Spirit Beast Mysterious Treasure Diagram pointed toward the egg being that of a Qilin.<br>If anyone said that Chu Feng was not afraid, then it would most definitely be a lie. After all, that was the legendary divine beast Qilin, a creature that possessed unimaginable power.<br>That said, it was precisely because of how powerful Qilins were that Chu Feng&rsquo;s current excitement far surpassed his fear.<br>Chu Feng had always been a courageous person his entire life. Thus, he was already unable to keep himself from thinking of what he'd have to deal with should it really be a Qilin&rsquo;s egg.<br>It was normal for divine beasts to be very difficult to handle. However, if one were able to subdue a divine beast and make it work for them, it would be an extremely amazing feat.<br>As such, how could Chu Feng not possibly be excited?<br>&ldquo;Xing&rsquo;er, the gap has been repaired. Furthermore, you and the three young friends have also reached the time limit for your stay in the Peach Garden Mystic Realm. Prepare yourselves, you will be brought out soon.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, that old man&rsquo;s voice sounded again.<br>The Peach Garden Mystic Realm was indeed returning to normal.<br>As such, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er had finally heaved a sigh of relief.<br>That said, Chu Feng actually knew very well that it was not the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elders that had managed to fix the so-called gap using their spirit formation.<br>Instead, Chu Feng was able to sense that it was the Qilin&rsquo;s egg in his Cosmos Sack that had stopped absorbing the power of the Mystic Realm. It was because of that, and not because of the Tantai Heavenly Clan sealing the gap, that the Peach Garden Mystic Realm returned to normal.<br>Chu Feng continued to observe the egg. He felt that the egg would not suddenly absorb power for no reason. Since it had absorbed power, it should undergo some sort of change.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a crack? Could it be because it had absorbed power from the Peach Garden Mystic Realm?&rdquo;<br>After examining the egg, Chu Feng discovered that a crack had appeared on the egg. Although the crack was very small and hard to detect, it remained that it was present on the egg, and was noticed by Chu Feng.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng was certain that when he had first obtained the egg, there was no such crack.<br>However, Chu Feng was also unable to ensure that the crack had appeared just then. It might also be possible that the crack had been present for some time now. After all, he did not inspect the egg daily.<br>Thus, he could not be certain if the crack was related to the egg&rsquo;s sudden absorption of power from the Peach Garden Mystic Realm.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, someone gently patted Chu Feng. This caused Chu Feng to stop his observation of the egg.<br>Chu Feng turned around, and saw that it was actually Gong Qing.<br>&ldquo;Hey, just then, Miss Tantai Xing&rsquo;er said that you&rsquo;re her benefactor. What did you help her with?&rdquo; Gong Qing quietly asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Nothing much, it was just something minor,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied using voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;Something minor? I doubt that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; Gong Qing pouted her little mouth. Then, she said, &ldquo;My apologies. My big sister doesn&rsquo;t understand your character. She actually doesn&rsquo;t hold any malice towards you. Please don&rsquo;t take her actions to heart.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing between your big sister and I to begin with. She was the one who was overthinking it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, the way your big sister treated me is her business. It will not affect the relationship between you and I,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>Gong Qing wanted to say something. However, she ultimately said nothing.<br>After all, what Gong Mingyue had done was truly too excessive. Gong Qing was unable to speak up for her.<br>Besides, Chu Feng&rsquo;s response seemed to indicate that he did not plan to make things difficult for her big sister.<br>Not long afterward, a spirit formation gate appeared. After that spirit formation gate opened, before Chu Feng and the others could decide to enter it of their own accord, they were all sucked into it.<br>That spirit formation gate was naturally the exit to the Peach Garden Mystic Realm. Thus, after passing through the gate, Chu Feng and the others returned to the Peach Mountain Garden, where all the younger generations were gathered.<br>That said, Chu Feng and the others had no idea that the fishing old man on the cliff of that Peach Garden Mystic Realm currently had a complicated expression in his eyes.<br>If Chu Feng knew what had happened afterwards, he would most definitely have a completely new opinion of the Peach Garden Mystic Realm.<br>&ldquo;To actually be able to absorb the power of my spirit formation, the thing within that Cosmos Sack&rsquo;s egg is very extraordinary.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That crimson sword in the Cosmos Sack is also equally extraordinary.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To actually possess those things at such a young age, that brat seems to have had quite an extraordinary experience,&rdquo; the old man sitting by the cliff&rsquo;s edge gasped softly.<br>It was normal for him to gasp in admiration. However, his voice was extremely aged. It was completely different from the voice that had repeated the same words over and over to Chu Feng.<br>It was as if that were his actual voice. It was a voice that was left behind by the passage of countless years of great change.<br></p></div>
