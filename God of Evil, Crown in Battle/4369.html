        <div>: The Divine Deer Again<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Ma Chengying and the others weren&rsquo;t sure how to respond to those words from the Supreme Elder.<br>There was indeed some sense in what the Supreme Elder had said. If Chu Feng was really that powerful as to be able to curb all of them, they wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to live till now too.<br>After all, they had done something completely inhuman to Chu Feng earlier, and they could sense the full extent of Chu Feng&rsquo;s hatred toward them through his eyes too.<br>They had no doubt that Chu Feng would try to kill them as soon as he found an opportunity to do so.<br>&ldquo;The formation over here is set up by the sectmaster himself, and there&rsquo;s a protective barrier around the main formation too. The protective barrier is extremely powerful, such that other than the sectmaster and that Old Lunatic, no one will be able to breach it.<br>&ldquo;If even a mere transformation of the formation in the valley that sealed off spirit power was enough to trap that lad, there&rsquo;s no way he would have been able to enter the main formation at all. All of you should return and do what you have to do. After you rest up well, return to the formation core and continue infusing your energy into the main formation.<br>&ldquo;Before the sectmaster returns, we must make sure that the treasure is already at full maturity, or else it&rsquo;ll be a huge failure on our part. Understood?&rdquo;<br>It was apparent that the Supreme Elder didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance in this area was a big problem. He wasn&rsquo;t even willing to leave his formation core to look for Chu Feng.<br>From this, it could be seen how little he thought of Chu Feng as a threat.<br>&ldquo;Supreme Elder, we&hellip;&rdquo;<br>However, the disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo showed hesitant looks on their faces.<br>In truth, from the moment they reported the matter to the Supreme Elder, they were no longer worried that Chu Feng would be able to enter the main formation. After all, they had already done their due diligence and reported on the matter, so any complications that happened afterward couldn&rsquo;t be blamed on them anymore.<br>So, what they had to be worried about right now was their own safety.<br>They were afraid that Chu Feng would come back to exact vengeance on them.<br>If they were to return to the same resting spot and Chu Feng came over to look for them, what were they supposed to do?&rdquo;<br>Seeing through the worries of these disciples, the Supreme Elder sneered coldly, &ldquo;A bunch of useless wastrels!&rdquo;<br>He glanced backward and shouted out, &ldquo;Li Rui!&rdquo;<br>A short moment later, a good-looking man walked out of the formation behind him. He was the personal disciple of this Supreme Elder, and he went by the name of Li Rui.<br>&ldquo;Yes, master?&rdquo;<br>The man named Li Rui bowed deeply to the Supreme Elder before waiting for his dispatch.<br>&ldquo;You are not needed here anymore. Return with the rest of them. If you encounter a young man named Chu Feng, you can kill him right away. There&rsquo;s no need to capture him alive. Putting aside that he has killed Lu Xiong, just the fact that he&rsquo;s in this place at this very moment is more than enough to warrant him the death penalty!&rdquo; the Supreme Elder said.<br>&ldquo;Understood!&rdquo; Li Rui replied.<br>&ldquo;Supreme Elder, we&rsquo;ll be taking our leave then.&rdquo;<br>Ma Chengying and the others quickly took their leave from the area.<br>They were no longer afraid anymore because they had Li Rui with them. Even though Li Rui was from the younger generation, he was a powerful rank six Utmost Exalted level cultivator.<br>On top of that, the fighting prowess he wielded far exceeded that of his peers too.<br>Take for example, the rank six Utmost Exalted level Senior Lu who Chu Feng killed had crossed blows with Li Rui before, but with just a single strike, Senior Lu had already fallen in defeat.<br>Even though they were both at rank six Utmost Exalted level, their fighting prowess differed vastly from one another.<br>With Li Rui by their side, they were confident that they could curb Chu Feng even if he were to appear once more.<br>While they knew that Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power techniques were on par with that of rank six Utmost Exalted level cultivators, ultimately, spirit power techniques had several limitations to them.<br>While Chu Feng had been able to kill Senior Lu with his spirit battle techniques, they didn&rsquo;t think that he would be able to do the same to Lu Rui in a direct encounter.<br>&hellip;<br>The reason why Chu Feng was able to free himself was due to the divine deer within his body helping him again. This time around, it even used its powers to heal the injuries Chu Feng had sustained.<br>After that, it brought him over to a seemingly safer area.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really an obstinate fool. You&rsquo;re already in such danger, so why can&rsquo;t you just feign weak for a bit to fool them? Why do you have to foolishly charge straight to your death?&rdquo; the voice of the divine deer sounded in Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>There was a grudging edge to the divine deer&rsquo;s words.<br>She was angry at how Chu Feng still obstinately continued to threaten those people even while he was being tortured, refusing to concede at all. She felt that he had all the suffering he went through coming.<br>&ldquo;Elder, none of those fellows are good things. They are all scoundrels of the cultivation world. It&rsquo;s futile to beg with such people for mercy; I would only be throwing away my dignity for nothing,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Hah! Is dignity that important to you that you could throw away your life for it? Had this god known, I wouldn&rsquo;t have saved you so that you can die that valiant death that you so dearly craved for!&rdquo; the divine deer sneered coldly.<br>&ldquo;Elder, don&rsquo;t be like that. It&rsquo;s because I know that you&rsquo;re behind me that I was able to stand against them so confidently. I knew that you wouldn&rsquo;t bear to see me die,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a grin.<br>He was replying so leisurely that it seemed as if the cruelty that had happened earlier wasn&rsquo;t directed to him at all. It didn&rsquo;t affect his state of mind at all.<br>&ldquo;You can still laugh in a situation like this? Know that this god won&rsquo;t be so merciful as to keep saving you! If you can&rsquo;t even protect yourself, you wouldn&rsquo;t be worthy of my protection. Perhaps, I should just leave you to fend for yourself the next time around!&rdquo; the divine deer harrumphed.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I&rsquo;ll do my best so as to not disappoint you,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Cut the nonsense. You have a smart head, but you are way too naive. Do you think that something as important as the main formation would really be left unprotected? I can tell you frankly that the main formation has a barrier shrouding it, and given your strength, even if you somehow found your way to the main formation, you still wouldn&rsquo;t be able to breach the barrier and get in.<br>&ldquo;However, this god has done you a favor and brought you in. Right now, you are in the main formation. I&rsquo;ve already paved the way for you, so don&rsquo;t let me down,&rdquo; the divine deer said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very grateful for your help, elder, but if I may suggest something, since you have already helped me so much, wouldn&rsquo;t it be much more fulfilling for you to see this matter to the end? Help me get the treasure and escape from this place. This junior will surely repay your magnanimity in the future!&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You are really getting ahead of yourself. This is all the help I&rsquo;ll offer you, so you better buck up yourself if you want to get the treasure!&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the divine deer disappeared from view.<br>&ldquo;Elder, you&rsquo;re such a caring deer, so help me all the way, will you?<br>&ldquo;Elder?<br>&ldquo;Elder?&rdquo; Chu Feng continued calling out.<br>He had long known that the divine deer was no simple entity. If she were to help him with this matter, obtaining the treasure would really be a walk in the park.<br>It was just a pity that the divine deer didn&rsquo;t respond anymore no matter how Chu Feng shouted out.<br>The divine deer really was a deer of her words. She said that she would help him till here, so she really helped him till here.<br></p></div>
