        <h1>Chapter 4315</h1>
        <div> - This Old Man&rsquo;s Friend<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;This sensation?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>He discovered an abnormal reaction from the Qilin&rsquo;s egg in his Cosmos Sack.<br>Chu Feng immediately took out the Qilin&rsquo;s egg from his Cosmos Sack and discovered that it was flickering with a strange light. A large amount of energy was emerging from his Cosmos Sack.<br>It felt as if what was inside the egg was about to break out from it.<br>Recalling the words spoken by that black dragon, Chu Feng does not dare to show any neglect for this Qilin&rsquo;s egg.<br>He immediately placed down the Qilin&rsquo;s egg and began to set up a spirit formation.<br>Chu Feng needed to immediately tame what would emerge from the egg. Else, he might not be able to control it.<br>In a lighter case, it might refuse to listen to Chu Feng and leave him. That wouldn&rsquo;t matter too much.<br>But, in a more serious case, its powers might surpass Chu Feng and desire to eat him. Should that happen, things would be extremely bad.<br>Even though that would be a new life, Chu Feng cannot predict exactly how powerful it would be.<br>At the very least, the power unleashed by the egg right now brought him great fear.<br>&ldquo;Mn? It calmed down?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng discovered the Qilin&rsquo;s Egg grew quiet.<br>It had returned to how it was normally. Chu Feng was unable to detect any trace of abnormality or the feeling of the thing inside the egg about to break out from it.<br>Nevertheless, what happened earlier still made Chu Feng uneasy.<br>Thus, after he placed away the Qilin&rsquo;s egg, he immediately rushed back to the Seven Suns Mountain Range.<br>When Grandmaster Tang Chen and others discovered Chu Feng&rsquo;s return, they all felt relieved.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen was very curious about who Xianhai Gusu was. Thus, he turned to ask Chu Feng.<br>After all, a single glance from Xianhai Gusu had brought Grandmaster Tang Chen an unprecedented amount of deterrence.<br>Chu Feng had asked Xianhai Shaoyu if he could inform their identity to his friends before parting with them. Xianhai Shaoyu did not refuse him.<br>Thus, Chu Feng did not bother to conceal their identities either.<br>He informed Grandmaster Tang Chen, Yuan Shu and Yu Ting about Xianhai Shaoyu, Xianhai Gusu and Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s identities.<br>&ldquo;What?! You said&hellip; they&rsquo;re people from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan?!&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, Grandmaster Tang Chen knew of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. Else, he would not have such a horrified expression.<br>This was the first time Chu Feng saw such an expression on Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what is this Immortal Sea Fish Clan?&rdquo;<br>At this moment, the uncommunicative Yu Ting became very curious.<br>Before Chu Feng could answer her, Grandmaster Tang Chen began to inform her about the Immortal Sea Fish Clan.<br>Evidently, compared to Chu Feng, Grandmaster Tang Chen knew about the Immortal Sea FIsh Clan even better.<br>In fact, after hearing Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s explanations, Chu Feng gained a new understanding of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan.<br>The Immortal Sea Fish Clan were descended from the Ancient Era. But, flowing through their bodies were the bloodlines of modern cultivators.<br>In short, the Immortal Sea Fish Clan was a long established clan that had continued on for many years.<br>The Immortal Sea Galaxy has always been under the rule of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. Their bloodline was so powerful that it was praised that their bloodline was superior to Heavenly Bloodline.<br>Because of that, the Immortal Sea Fish Clan possess an outstanding reputation throughout the entire martial cultivation world.<br>Their influence was most definitely not limited to the Immortal Sea Galaxy.<br>Een the overlords of other galaxies would rarely dare to offend them.This holds truer for the other powers.<br>In simpler terms, the Immortal Sea Fish Clan could be said to be one of the strongest powers in the entire martial cultivation world since the passing of the Ancient Era.<br>They were truly a power that stood at the apex of the martial cultivation world.<br>It would not be excessive to call them gods.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you really certain they&rsquo;re from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan?&rdquo;<br>After explaining to the crowd what the Immortal Sea Fish Clan was, Grandmaster Tang Chen turned to ask Chu Feng again.<br>From his expression, Chu Feng could tell that he was afraid of something.<br>&ldquo;They are indeed from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. But, senior, you don&rsquo;t have to worry. They are my friends. They will not do any harm upon us,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>But, even though Chu Feng said those words, the look of worry on Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s face did not decrease.<br>&ldquo;This old man was slow-witted. I actually went against that great lady,&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen finally revealed his worry.<br>He was worried about the time when he went against Xianhai Gusu; trying to stop her from taking Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please rest assured. That&rsquo;s something in the past. They will not seek you out to cause trouble for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Compared to the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, we might actually have to worry about another power,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Another power?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that there&rsquo;s another colossus besides the Immortal Sea Fish Clan that came to our Holy Light Galaxy?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Yes. Senior, have you heard of the Demon Morph Clan?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Demon morph Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have. They are a power that will bring fear upon everyone in the vast martial cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be&hellip; they&rsquo;ve also arrived at our Holy Light Galaxy?&rdquo;<br>The look of worry on Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s face had evidently grown stronger after hearing the name Demon Morph Clan.<br>But, that was only the beginning. Once Chu Feng informed him about the matter with the Demon Morph Clan, Grandmaster Tang Chen began to frown deeply and grew quiet.<br>After a long time, he finally said to Chu Feng, Yuan Shu and Yu Ting, &ldquo;The three of you must leave the Holy Light Galaxy at once.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master, are we fleeing?&rdquo; asked Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;We must flee. The Demon Morph Clan is a power beyond your imagination. You all shouldn&rsquo;t be facing them,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Say, Tang Chen, how could you be this cowardly?&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, another figure appeared from within the forbidden area. It was the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist was not present when Chu Feng returned.<br>According to Grandmaster Tang Chen, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was worried about Chu Feng and went searching for him.<br>But, judging from his current reaction, he seemed to have learned about what happened.<br>This meant that he had returned to the forbidden area for some time.<br>&ldquo;Ox-nose, you should&rsquo;ve heard about how powerful the Demon Morph Clan is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Their manner of conduct is extremely ruthless to begin with. They dared to even willfully slaughter the innocent while in other galaxies.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In our Holy Light Galaxy, there&rsquo;s simply no power that could contend against them. No one can predict what they would end up doing here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps, before we could even react to what was going on, we would have perished together with this world,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Perish with this world?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng, Yu Ting and even Yuan Shu revealed complications expressions.<br>To perish a world?<br>Oh how powerful must one be?<br>Could cultivators really be able to perish an entire world?<br>&ldquo;Tang Chen, I naturally know what sort of power the Demon Morph Clan is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, they&rsquo;ve already left,&rdquo; said Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Left?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that you&rsquo;ve met the people from the Demon Morph Clan?&rdquo;<br>It was not only Grandmaster Tang Chen. Even Chu Feng looked to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist with a look of wonder.<br>Even Chu Feng had never personally met the people from the Demon Morph Clan. Thus, how did the Ox-nosed Old Daoist know they&rsquo;ve left?<br>&ldquo;This old man is someone that travels extensively. I&rsquo;ve made friends far and wide. Among my friends, there are inevitably some exceptionally powerful individuals.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It just so happened that a friend of mine was recently at our Holy Light Galaxy. It was that friend that informed me of the Demon Morph Clan&rsquo;s departure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, you all don&rsquo;t have to worry about the Demon Morph Clan.&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist stroked his beard as he spoke in a manner immensely pleased with himself.<br>The four other people present were all immersed in the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s words.<br>Because of that, no one noticed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist took a meaningful glance at Chu Feng as he said those words.<br></p></div>
