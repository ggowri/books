        <div> - The Whimsical Princess<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Chu Feng was looking at Long Xiaoxiao, Long Xiaoxiao seemed to notice his gaze, and actually turned around to look at him.<br>She smiled sweetly at Chu Feng. A charming smile appeared on her youthful and intelligent face.<br>Then, with her hands behind her back, she walked towards Chu Feng with graceful and charming steps.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor, please accept this young woman&rsquo;s respect,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao actually bowed to Chu Feng after walking over to him.<br>This scene completely stupefied everyone.<br>Why would their incomparably grand princess be bowing to someone with such a lowly status?<br>Furthermore, she even called him benefactor. This was simply a scandal!<br>However, compared to the others, Long Shengbu revealed a faint smile on his previously extremely serious face.<br>Only Long Xiaoxiao, Long Shengbu and Chu Feng knew what had happened between them.<br>&ldquo;I am Chu Feng. I pay my respects to the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Lord Supreme Elder and Her Highness.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng bowed in return.<br>Chu Feng knew very well that their weak appearances in the Endless Abyss had been nothing more than disguises..<br>The current them was who they really were.<br>Faced with their current identities, Chu Feng could not continue to interact with them as a benefactor.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for this sort of greeting in the future. Furthermore, I&rsquo;m allowing you to address me by name.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, remember that I am not called Long Xiao. Rather, my name is Long Xiaoxiao.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, I am not a man. I am a young woman.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Long Xiaoxiao winked a large eye at Chu Feng mischievously.<br>It must be said that if one were to ignore how ruthless she was before, the girl was truly quite adorable.<br>&ldquo;Your Highness doesn&rsquo;t have to deliberately explain things. I can tell,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This old man is also not called Long Busheng. Rather, my name is Long Shengbu,&rdquo; said Long Shengbu with a smile.<br>&ldquo;I, on the other hand, am really called Chu Feng,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Whilst their exchange didn&rsquo;t appear to be anything serious, the people below were feeling extremely envious.<br>Even Long Daozhi and the people from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City were completely stunned.<br>Those were the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s princess and Supreme Elder, people that stood high and above, people that they could not interact with.<br>Their identities were simply too noble.<br>Yet, Chu Feng was actually able to chat cheerfully with them?<br>Even though the people from Ancestral Martial Dragon City all knew that Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent was exceptional, it remained that Chu Feng had only been a Chu Heavenly Clansman when they first knew him.<br>In the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan needed the protection of their Ancestral Martial Dragon City to exist. It was because of them that the Chu Heavenly Clan had become renowned.<br>Yet, in the blink of an eye, Chu Feng was actually able to joke around with people that they did not dare to blaspheme, grand existences within the Dragon Clan that they could not even approach.<br>They felt as if it was a dream, an illusion. It was simply too unbelievable.<br>An indescribable feeling appeared in their hearts.<br>After a short exchange of casual talk, Chu Feng descended from the sky and arrived beside Long Daozhi.<br>He was still worried about Long Daozhi&rsquo;s injuries. Thus, he wanted to personally treat him.<br>After all, it could affect Long Daozhi&rsquo;s future.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, quickly, tell me how you know Her Highness and Lord Supreme Elder.&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi had regained his composure, and began to question Chu Feng with great curiosity.<br>He was simply too curious and envious of Chu Feng.<br>After all, those were the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Lord Supreme Elder and Her Highness of all people.<br>Chu Feng didn't hide anything. Whilst treating Long Daozhi&rsquo;s injuries, he began explaining what had happened to him.<br>That said, Chu Feng did so through voice transmission. After all, for some things, there was no need for him to speak publicly. It would do as long as those he was close to learned about it.<br>Whilst Chu Feng was treating Long Daozhi&rsquo;s injuries, Long Xiaoxiao looked to Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Girl, you&rsquo;re quite courageous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, while your courage is laughable, your talk is simply too big, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What makes you think I&rsquo;m talking big?&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er showed no fear of Long Xiaoxiao. Not only that, but she was also emitting a slight amount of aversion toward her.<br>She was also looking at Long Xiaoxiao with a slightly hostile gaze.<br>This scene astounded many people.<br>Although the girl was good-looking, she shouldn&rsquo;t be so disrespectful, no? How could she dare speak to the grand Dragon Clan&rsquo;s princess with such an attitude?<br>However, Long Xiaoxiao did not get angry. Instead, she smiled and said, &ldquo;Girl, if it wasn&rsquo;t for me revealing myself promptly, you&rsquo;d have ended very miserably. RIght now, you should be thanking me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Hearing that, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er also revealed a faint smile.<br>&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t reveal yourself, your entire Dragon Clan would&rsquo;ve been wiped out,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Girl, you talk quite big,&rdquo; hearing those words, Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s smile grew more fawning.<br>&ldquo;Stop calling me girl. Your big sister here is bigger than you,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Bigger than me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What about you is bigger than me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It seems like that place is indeed bigger,&rdquo; as Long Xiaoxiao spoke, she glanced at Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s chest.<br>&ldquo;You little girl&hellip;&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er subconsciously looked at her chest. Then, her exceptionally beautiful face turned red like a ripened apple.<br>The reason for that was because what Long Xiaoxiao had said was correct.<br>Her chest was indeed much more developed compared to Long Xiaoxiao.<br>But, after Long Xiaoxiao mentioned it, many of the people present all turned their eyes to Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s chest. Thus, how could she not be embarrassed?<br>Even though she was wearing clothes, she still felt embarrassed after being looked at like that by so many people.<br>But, she was unable to say anything.<br>&ldquo;Oh my, so you actually know how to be embarrassed too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t do. Since you love to boast so much, you&rsquo;ll have to toughen your skin a bit, no?&rdquo;<br>As Long Xiaoxiao spoke, she actually extended her little hand and pinched Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was very displeased, and swatted Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s hand away.<br>Long Xiaoxiao did not get angry at Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s disrespectful behavior. Instead, a charming smile appeared on her beautiful face.<br>&ldquo;I must say that it felt quite good. I wonder which brat will be enjoying that in the future.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be Chu Feng, right?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao blinked her large eyes and asked with a mischievous smile on her face.<br>&ldquo;What nonsense are you spouting?!&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face grew even redder after hearing that.<br>&ldquo;Nothing. I&rsquo;m just casually saying stuff.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if you wanted that, Chu Feng would not necessarily want you either,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao said with a grinning smile.<br>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;<br>Already red-faced, anger now appeared in Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s eyes.<br>However, seeing the smiling Long Xiaoxiao, she was unable to unleash her anger.<br>&ldquo;Well then, I&rsquo;m not going to tease you anymore.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Girl, your skin is not tough at all. You&rsquo;re incapable of withstanding my teasing.&rdquo;<br>With that, Long Xiaoxiao took butterfly-like steps and bounced over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side.<br>Seeing Long Xiaoxiao approaching them, the people from Ancestral Martial Dragon City immediately bowed respectfully. Even the seriously-injured Long Daozhi tried his best to stand up.<br>None of them dared show any neglect towards the noble princess.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother. This is what I hate the most.&rdquo;<br>However, Long Xiaoxiao waved her hand.<br>The people from Ancestral Martial Dragon City were at a loss as to how to respond.<br>They didn&rsquo;t dare continue to bow respectfully to Long Xiaoxiao. Yet, they also didn&rsquo;t dare to stop.<br>They were afraid. They were fearful of Long Xiaoxiao.<br>They didn&rsquo;t know if she was serious or not.<br>If she was serious, it would be fine for them to stop bowing to her. But, if she wasn&rsquo;t serious, and they stopped paying respects, they would instead displease her.<br>As the saying went, being close to a sovereign can be as perilous as lying next to a tiger.<br>Helpless, they turned to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Listen to Her Highness,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Your Highness,&rdquo; the people from Ancestral Martial Dragon City, including Long Daozhi, immediately expressed their thanks.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with Your Highness this and Your Highness that? Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to address me as Long Xiaoxiao from now on?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao said facetiously.<br>Then, she glanced at Long Daozhi. &ldquo;Here. Take this. It will be beneficial to your dantian&rsquo;s recovery.&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao took out a medicinal pellet and tossed it to Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
