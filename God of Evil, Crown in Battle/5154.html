        <h1>Chapter 5153</h1>
        <div>: Shock<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng would have never imagined that the Tiger person would actually be Old Cat!<br>Now that he thought about it, the familiar voice, the despicable means, and the unusual surname of &lsquo;Tiger&rsquo;&hellip; These clues were all pointing at Old Cat!<br>&ldquo;I would have never thought that I would meet it here. It must be heaven&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;<br>After the initial shock, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes suddenly glowed in excitement. Old Cat had been like a deity to him back when he was still in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Even the Golden Crane True Immortal was nothing but an ant before it.<br>Due to that, Chu Feng could only watch helplessly as Old Cat kidnapped Xue Ji and took away the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip. It would be an exaggeration to say that there was a deep-seated grudge between them, but their encounter had been a knot in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart.<br>Now that they were reunited at this place when he was finally ready to turn things around, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder if it had all been predestined. He was no longer in a hurry to show himself anymore, wanting to take his time to play with this old cat.<br>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing glared at Old Cat furiously as he questioned.<br>&ldquo;Who am I? Are you scared out of your wits? You don&rsquo;t know who I am? I am Lord Tiger!&rdquo;<br>Standing outside the formation, Old Cat took a puff of smoke as it looked at Bai Yunqing scornfully.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re that Tiger trash!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing widened his eyes in realization. &ldquo;Are you the one who set up this formation? How are you able to set up such a powerful formation? Not to mention, didn&rsquo;t Lord Zhenlong forbid us from attacking one another?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I said that you&rsquo;re dumb. Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s formation has already left you with a clue. It&rsquo;s only in the trial halls that fighting is prohibited; the rule doesn&rsquo;t extend to the corridors. You have already passed through two corridors now, but you didn&rsquo;t notice anything at all. I really can&rsquo;t understand what your master saw in you and your thick skull,&rdquo; Old Cat sneered.<br>&ldquo;You despicable fellow! How dare you disrespect me when you know who my master is? Do you not fear death? Mark my words, I&rsquo;ll take that wretched life of yours once we&rsquo;re out of here!&rdquo;<br>Bai Yunqing glared at Old Cat.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Old Cat&rsquo;s lips crept upward before it grandly flung its sleeves.<br>Pah!<br>Inside the formation, Bai Yunqing received a slap.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead meat!&rdquo;<br>That slap further stoked Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s rage. Even acrossthe encirclement of the assault formation, one could still feel his killing intent. However, Old Cat wasn&rsquo;t intimidated in the least. If anything, his smile further widened.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I said you&rsquo;re dumb. Now that I have made a move on you, do you think that I&rsquo;ll let you escape from here? Do you not know what it means to silence a person? If anyone will die, it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; Old Cat said with narrowed eyes.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Bai Yunqing was stunned. His killing intent receded and his arrogant smile faded, replaced with fear and panic. This was the first time the disciple of the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s First Guest Elder was showing such a terrified expression.<br>Old Cat&rsquo;s words had awoken him.<br>He did have the backing of his master, but other than Chu Feng, no one knew that Old Cat was in here. If Old Cat silenced them here, who would possibly know that it was the culprit who had taken his life?<br>&ldquo;Lord Cat&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Yunqing immediately switched to a fawning tone.<br>&ldquo;What Lord Cat? Call me Lord Tiger!&rdquo; Old Cat corrected him.<br>&ldquo;Lord Tiger, I was blind and foolish. I had eyes but couldn&rsquo;t see Mount Tai. Please don&rsquo;t hold it against me. I was just putting on a brave front. My master has already chosen to leave me to the lurch, or else I wouldn&rsquo;t have to come here all alone.<br>&ldquo;I am also a pitiful one. I have done so much for my master, but no one has even heard of my name. Not only so, but my master has also even abandoned me! That&rsquo;s why I had to come here to grasp onto an opportunity to change his mind!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing cried out loud.<br>However, Old Cat looked at him as if he was a fool.<br>&ldquo;Bai Yunqing, I might still respect you if you showed some spunk, but your change in attitude only makes me look down on you. I have already heard of your affairs. Your master still harbors great expectations for you. Yet, you actually uttered such lies here for your own survival. What a disgrace!&rdquo; Old Cat sneered.<br>&ldquo;Y-you actually heard of me?&rdquo;<br>Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s face paled. He had no idea how to respond to this situation.<br>&ldquo;Bai Yunqing, I don&rsquo;t have much of a grudge against you. If not for your sharp tongue, I wouldn&rsquo;t have gone this far either. However, out of the kindness of my heart, I offer a choice. As long as you hand over all of your treasures and cooperate with me in this ancient remnant from now onward, I promise that I won&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll cooperate with you! As long as you don&rsquo;t hurt me, I&rsquo;ll do whatever you ask me to!&rdquo;<br>Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s ego had completely deflated under the threat of death. The only thing left on his mind was how he could survive this crisis.<br>Weng!<br>Right after he said those words, the key drifted toward Old Cat.<br>&ldquo;Hoh, looks like the key has also given up on you,&rdquo; Old Cat scoffed.<br>In truth, Old Cat had tried snatching the key using his spirit power after trapping Bai Yunqing, but it was to no avail. That was why he demanded Bai Yunqing cooperate with him. Yet, right after Bai Yunqing said those words, the key immediately drifted to him.<br>Bai Yunqing couldn&rsquo;t have relinquished the key on his own accord so quickly. The more plausible explanation here was that the key had deemed Bai Yunqing to be unworthy of it.<br>Knowing that, Bai Yunqing lowered his head in humiliation.<br>After obtaining Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s key, Old Cat turned its eyes toward Chu Feng&hellip; or at least where it thought Chu Feng was based on his key-shaped assault formation. Till now, it still thought that it had Chu Feng in its grasp.<br>&ldquo;Brat, a true man knows when to back down. Are you going to obediently hand over your key, or do I have to make you do it?&rdquo; Old Cat said menacingly.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t respond.<br>&ldquo;It looks like you still don&rsquo;t know your place. Since that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll let you have a glimpse into what I&rsquo;m capable of!&rdquo;<br>Old Cat channeled his formation to attack Chu Feng.<br>Whoosh!<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s key-shaped assault formation immediately exploded. Yellow fluid poured out from it and gushed toward Old Cat like a terrifying tsunami. By the time Old Cat realized what was going on, it was already submerged in the yellow fluid from the neck down.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Is this poop?&rdquo;<br>Old Cat&rsquo;s complexion was as awful as one could imagine. Be it appearance or smell, the yellow fluid he was trapped in looked no different from feces.<br>Bai Yunqing was caught in the tsunami of poop too, but Chu Feng had secretly knocked him out using the power of the assault formation. Of course, the yellow fluid was not real feces but something manifested using spirit power. That was the prank he had added into the formation to disgust Old Cat.<br>&ldquo;Shit, I was tricked! Brat, you really are despicable. How dare you assault me?&rdquo;<br>Old Cat quickly realized that the key was fake and that it had been duped.<br>&ldquo;Despicable? I prefer to call it &lsquo;giving you a taste of your medicine&rsquo;,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he revealed his true appearance.<br>The moment it saw Chu Feng&rsquo;s face, Old Cat froze in place.<br></p></div>
