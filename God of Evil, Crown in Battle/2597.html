        <div> - Undetermined Life And Death<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Although they had no idea what sort of spirit formation this was, they were able to understand how to set up the spirit formation by following the spirit formation diagram.<br>Afterwards, Kong Yuehua and Kong Shunlian also joined the great army and began setting up the spirit formation.<br>This scene was truly magnificent. The experts from various powers were all gathered together doing the same task.<br>Even those who were originally enemies were able to temporarily set aside their grudges to set up a spirit formation together. This was truly an astonishing sight.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, it&rsquo;s been a long time.&rdquo;<br>Among the vast gathering of world spiritists, a man with three swords quietly arrived before a monk.<br>&ldquo;Well, well, is this not Daoist Three Swords? It has truly been a long time. Last time we met, it was on Mount Cloud Crane, no?&rdquo; Upon seeing the person who called to him, that monk responded with a smile on his face and temporarily stopped what he was doing.<br>This man was the Immortal Sword School&rsquo;s Daoist Three Swords. As for the &lsquo;Grandmaster&rsquo; that he called for, it was Grandmaster Pocket.<br>Back then, both of them had received Chu Feng&rsquo;s assistance and helped Chu Feng back on Mount Cloud Crane.<br>Although they had only met Chu Feng that one time, they could be said to possess a somewhat friendly relationship.<br>The two of them had thought very highly of Chu Feng since that time.<br>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. Recalling what happened back then, I truly felt a great amount of disbelief.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I&rsquo;d already guessed that little friend Chu Feng would be able to obtain great accomplishments in the future, I never expected him to accomplish this much,&rdquo; Daoist Three Sword gasped in admiration.<br>Grandmaster Pocket looked around. He swept his gaze over the magnificent scene around him and gasped with admiration, &ldquo;This sort of charisma is truly astonishing. It is something that only rulers possess.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Charisma?&rdquo; Daoist Three Swords was slightly startled. Then, he laughed, &ldquo;Indeed. To be able to have this many people willingly cooperate is indeed a sign of little friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s individual charisma.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In merely a short few years, he managed to conquer many of the people in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&rdquo;<br>Daoist Three Swords agreed with what Grandmaster Pocket said.<br>The two of them felt that Chu Feng&rsquo;s individual charisma was something that was not present even among countless people, that it was the charisma of a ruler.<br>Their agreement also served to verify that the two of them both felt that Chu Feng would ultimately become the ruler of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm in the future.<br>&hellip;...<br>For the sake of rescuing Chu Feng, the vast amount of people outside were joining hands to set up a spirit formation. It was a grand and magnificent scene.<br>However, Chu Feng had no idea what was happening outside. He was proceeding forward through the Gates of Hell the entire time.<br>As such, Chu Feng was naturally suffering from the constant torment of the sharp blades.<br>Chu Feng was currently covered in cuts. His flesh was already badly mutilated. It could be said that there was not a single uninjured piece of flesh on him.<br>Most importantly, even though Chu Feng was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist and possessed many abilities to heal his injuries, they were all ineffective toward his injuries.<br>Chu Feng was unable to heal his wounds. Thus, he was completely covered in blood and looked extremely frightening.<br>In fact, he did not even resemble a human. Instead, he resembled a monster.<br>The reason for that was because red gaseous flames were burning from his wounds.<br>As the gaseous flames rose, crimson light surged forth. At a glance, it was truly frightening.<br>If it had been an ordinary person, they would most definitely not be able to withstand this sort of torment.<br>However, there was an aspect to Chu Feng that surpassed ordinary individuals. Not only did he possess extremely incredible willpower, but he was even able to gradually adapt to torment after experiencing it for a long period of time.<br>Although Chu Feng still felt the pain, the sensation of pain was much duller compared to the first time he felt it.<br>With this being the case, Chu Feng was able to hasten his pace.<br>Finally, an exit appeared before Chu Feng.<br>He passed through the final blades and walked out from the exit. Once he walked out, he discovered a pond.<br>The pond was not very large. However, the water in it was so clear that one could see the bottom of the pond.<br>&ldquo;This pond&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing this pond, Chu Feng revealed a joyous expression.<br>As an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that this seemingly ordinary pond possessed a healing effect.<br>As such, how could Chu Feng possibly hesitate? He immediately leaped from the exit of the Gates of Hell into the pond.<br>&ldquo;Splash~~~&rdquo;<br>After entering the pond, the red gaseous flames coming from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body grew even more intense. It looked like a small volcanic eruption. In an instant, the crimson gaseous flames soon filled this entire region.<br>Most importantly, with Chu Feng as the center, a layer of red gaseous substance began to spread through the water.<br>The pond water that was originally extremely clear turned muddy very quickly. It soon resembled a pond of blood.<br>That said, the pain Chu Feng felt was decreasing.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo;<br>After his pain started to subside, Chu Feng cast his gaze toward the Gates of Hell above the pond. Lingering fear was present in his eyes.<br>However, upon doing so, he was surprised to discover that the Gates of Hell had disappeared.<br>Chu Feng had no idea when it had disappeared.<br>The traps and mechanisms here truly appeared and disappeared unpredictably. Even Chu Feng was unable to catch them.<br>&ldquo;Huu, huu, huu~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, the pond water that was originally tranquil started to surge, forming a small-scale whirlpool. That whirlpool was not far away from Chu Feng.<br>It turned out that the pond water was sinking and draining into that whirlpool.<br>Soon, all of the pond water disappeared. Chu Feng discovered that&hellip; a cave entrance had appeared at the location where the pond water had drained away.<br>Chu Feng carefully observed his surroundings. He discovered that apart from that cave entrance, there were only rocks that covered the walls. Evidently&hellip; this cave was the sole exit.<br>After Chu Feng approached the cave, he felt a bitter chill emanating from that cave. Unendurable chilliness filled that cave.<br>Most importantly, three large characters were written on top of the cave - &lsquo;Soul-extracting Cave.&rsquo; [1. Those are 3 characters in chinese.]<br>&ldquo;Is this the second trial?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the name &lsquo;Soul-extracting Cave,&rsquo; Chu Feng started to frown. He had realized that this not-very-large cave entrance was evidently the only path he could take.<br>That said, after Chu Feng experienced the trial of the Gates of Hell, he felt that this Soul-extracting Cave would be even more dangerous.<br>However, Chu Feng had no other choice.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was planning to enter the Soul-extracting Cave, Her Lady Queen asked, &ldquo;Are you planning to continue right away? Don&rsquo;t you want to relax a bit?&rdquo;<br>She had accompanied Chu Feng the entire time. Thus, she knew how difficult this journey had been for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That pond water is extremely magical. My injuries are pretty much all healed. Furthermore, I am unable to sense the pain anymore. As for my stamina, there is no wear and tear either. Thus, there&rsquo;s no need to rest.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he leapt directly into that Soul-extracting Cave filled with chilliness.<br>After entering the Soul-extracting Cave, he began to slide downward. The most unbearable aspect was once again that bitter cold.<br>The coldness directly penetrated Chu Feng&rsquo;s bones. Then, Chu Feng felt as if the coldness had entered his bones directly. That sort of freezing sensation caused Chu Feng to feel as if his entire body was being ripped apart. Even his thoughts were no longer clear.<br>In this sort of situation, Chu Feng&rsquo;s awareness started to grow fuzzy. The only thing he could feel was the torment from the bitter cold, and a formless power that wanted to draw out his soul from him.<br>To put it briefly, the coldness that Chu Feng was feeling right now was even harder to bear than the cuts from the blades of the Gates of Hell.<br>&ldquo;You cannot slow down and wait for death. You must leave this place immediately,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my intention.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he activated his<br>Lightning<br>Armor and<br>Lightning<br>Wings. After his cultivation increased, he unleashed a movement martial skill to increase the speed of his descent.<br>However, after his speed increased, the pain Chu Feng felt also grew stronger.<br>&ldquo;Eeahh~~~&rdquo;<br>The pain was so unbearable that even Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from shouting in pain.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng&rsquo;s awareness also grew more and more fuzzy. That said, no matter how fuzzy his awareness became, it did not slow down the speed of his descent.<br>Finally, the bitter cold was over. The pain Chu Feng endured was finally eased. Gradually, his awareness grew clear again. However, he discovered that he had not reached the end of the tunnel. Instead, he was still descending.<br>&ldquo;Crap, there&rsquo;s more?&rdquo;<br>At this moment, Chu Feng shouted &lsquo;oh no&rsquo; in his heart. Even though the bitter cold was gone, Chu Feng was able to feel an intense heat from beneath him. Beneath him was most definitely a ferocious heat.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, Chu Feng soon descended into the extreme heat. Soon, the heat covered his entire body.<br>The sensation of this intense heat was completely different from the bitter cold. One was a bone-chilling cold, whereas the other was so hot that he felt as if he would soon melt.<br>However, there was one similar aspect in the two.<br>That is, a formless power was invading his soul. That power transformed into countless large hands and was tightly grabbing onto his soul with the intention of ripping it to pieces and then removing it from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>Under this sort of situation, Chu Feng soon experienced what he had felt earlier. His awareness that had gradually grown clear was once again becoming more and more fuzzy.<br>However, that was not the most cruel aspect...<br>Most cruel of all, this Soul-extracting Cave was like an unending tunnel with death being its final destination. Chu Feng felt as if only by dying would he be able to break free from all this.<br>Completely muddled, Chu Feng even lost track of time.<br>Finally, he landed on the ground. He had managed to escape that Soul-extracting Cave.<br>However, at this moment, Chu Feng was motionless like a corpse. Just like that, he laid on the ground.<br>Bruises covered his entire body, and he showed no signs of life.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s life and death was truly undetermined.<br><br></p></div>
