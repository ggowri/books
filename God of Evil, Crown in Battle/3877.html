        <div> - Old Friend?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;This place really is the death gate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The YinYang Guidance Lamps are truly too powerful. They were not mistaken, they were correct.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Turns out, the gate on the left is the life gate, and the one on the right is the death gate.&rdquo;<br>Soon, Chu Feng became certain of this thought.<br>That aura of death could not be fake. It was truly going to demand his life.<br>That said, although Chu Feng confirmed that he had stepped into the gate of death, his panicking heart actually managed to calm down a lot.<br>The reason for that was because he had not only confirmed that he had entered the death gate, but he had also confirmed that his choice, although wrong, was correct.<br>Although that place was indeed the death gate, he was still able to obtain an inheritance there.<br>Furthermore, according to Chu Feng&rsquo;s deduction, the inheritance that he could obtain there might actually be the real inheritance.<br>Merely, it was very difficult to obtain the inheritance from that place.<br>Chu Feng needed to break free from the strange palms that had enveloped him, and the strange power that was restricting his body.<br>Otherwise, that power would slowly engulf him.<br>If he didn&rsquo;t break free from them, Chu Feng&hellip; would really end up dying there.<br>As for the method to breach them, Chu Feng had a guess in mind.<br>By relying on his own body&rsquo;s strength, it would simply be impossible for him to contend against the powers there. Thus, the only thing Chu Feng could rely on would be his spirit power.<br>Thus, Chu Feng closed his eyes and began to sense his surroundings with his spirit power.<br>Upon doing so, Chu Feng was surprised to discover that once he closed his eyes and used his spirit power to sense things, the surroundings changed completely.<br>He was no longer in the palace hall. Instead, he was in a place of primal chaos, a place of nothingness.<br>The surroundings were completely pitch-black. It was a world filled with darkness.<br>However, in that world were strange bodies moving about.<br>Those moving bodies were all obstructions, blocking Chu Feng.<br>That place was simply a maze.<br>Only by breaking free from the blockades would Chu Feng be able to escape..<br>Thus, Chu Feng began to use his spirit power to create a path of escape in this obstruction-filled space.<br>However&hellip; it was a very difficult task.<br>Chu Feng had inherited his martial power from his father.<br>As for his spirit power, he had inherited it from his mother.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s martial power surpassed that of ordinary people. However, it was actually his Spirit Power that was much superior to that of ordinary people.<br>Thus, Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power was actually much stronger than his martial power.<br>However, even though his spirit power was very powerful, Chu Feng was still quickly exhausted after using it.<br>From this, it could be seen how difficult it would be to purely use spirit power to escape from that place.<br>At the beginning, Chu Feng was still able to make judgements rationally. However, later on, he completely relied on his awareness to break free from his surroundings.<br>With that, Chu Feng&rsquo;s awareness started turning fuzzy. In fact, he couldn&rsquo;t even determine if his methods were correct.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s head jolted. He seemed to have heard someone calling him?<br>Was it a misconception?<br>Chu Feng was uncertain if that call he had heard was real or false.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, save me.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, that voice was heard again. That was no illusion. Someone was really calling for him.<br>Furthermore, that voice sounded rather familiar.<br>Hearing that voice, Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power subconsciously moved towards the direction where that voice was coming from.<br>Strangest of all, even though that place was pitch-black, including even the obstructions, Chu Feng saw something completely different as moved towards that voice -- it was a body of light.<br>The closer Chu Feng approached, the clearer things became. That was a person, a woman.<br>That woman was deep inside the pitch-black space. She created a complete contrast against her surroundings. It was extremely strange.<br>However, that woman&rsquo;s appearance was not at all strange. On the contrary&hellip; her appearance was extremely beautiful.<br>She had a youthful appearance, possessed an alluring figure, and gave off an extraordinary air. It was as if all of the strong points that women wanted had gathered upon her.<br>It would not be excessive in the slightest to say that even rare beauties like Su Rou and Su Mei would be slightly inferior when compared to that woman.<br>That woman possessed both Su Rou&rsquo;s elegant charm and Su Mei&rsquo;s youthfulness. It was as if Su Rou and Su Mei&rsquo;s strong points were all gathered on her.<br>Standing there, she resembled a perfect beauty.<br>Journeying from the Lower Realm to the Upper Realms, Chu Feng had encountered countless women, countless so-called exceptional beauties.<br>However, upon seeing that woman, Chu Feng was captured by her beauty.<br>What did it mean to be a beauty?<br>That person was what it meant to be an actual exceptional beauty.<br>That said, after a moment of surprise, Chu Feng felt extremely astonished.<br>At the same time, he also felt very confused.<br>The reason for that was because that exceptional beauty that had appeared in that strange space was someone he knew. Her name was Yan Ruyu.<br>Back in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm&rsquo;s Nine Provinces Continent&rsquo;s Azure Province, there was a sect by the name of the Jade Maiden Sect.<br>The Jade Maiden Sect was a top rated sect in the Azure Province. All the members of the sect were women.<br>Due to their strict standards in accepting new disciples, the disciples of the Jade Maiden Sect ended up all possessing exceptional talent and outstanding beauty.<br>In the Azure Province, the Jade Maiden Sect was simply a place where celestial fairies lived.<br>In the Jade Maiden Sect, the person with the best talent and most outstanding beauty was that Yan Ruyu.<br>Because of her exceptional beauty, she was nicknamed &lsquo;the young lady in the portrait.&rsquo;<br>Back when Chu Feng was still in the Azure Province, still a disciple of the Azure Dragon School, Chu Feng has had an engagement with Yan Ruyu.<br>Because of that engagement, Chu Feng and Yan Ruyu had ended up in a conflict. Later on, he had been poisoned by Yan Ruyu&rsquo;s close friend, lost control of himself, and caused an enormous blunder. He ended up doing what he should never have done to Yan Ruyu.<br>Later on, by pure coincidence, Chu Feng and Yan Ruyu met each other again in the Eastern Sea Region.<br>The two of them not only resolved their previous grievances, but Chu Feng also assisted Yan Ruyu, bringing her to the Eastern Sea Region&rsquo;s Misty Peak to stay and train there.<br>However, later on, Yan Ruyu had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared from the Misty Peak...<br>Ya Fei and Murong Wan had also disappeared with her.<br>Due to Chu Feng&rsquo;s youthful frivolousness, he had wronged all three girls.<br>Feeling extremely ashamed and guilty, Chu Feng ended up having special emotions for them.<br>All these years, even though Chu Feng had been journeying throughout the Outer World the entire time, he still thought about those three girls all the time, wondering where they&rsquo;d gone to.<br>However, no matter how much he thought about it, he was unable to think of a single place.<br>Never did he expect that he would actually see Yan Ruyu there.<br>The voice that had called out to him earlier, seeking his help, wasn&rsquo;t that Yan Ruyu?<br></p></div>
