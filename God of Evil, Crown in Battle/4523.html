        <div>: A Mysterious Shadow<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite hearing Song Yun&rsquo;s threatening words, Song Xue&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t lose her temper. Instead, she replied with a smile, &ldquo;You lass, how can you value your love more than friendship? You&rsquo;re going kill me over a man whom you just met?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Haha, I&rsquo;m just kidding around! You can&rsquo;t be taking me seriously, right?&rdquo; Song Yun laughed even more heartily in response, such that anyone would have thought that she was just joking earlier.<br>However, Song Xue&rsquo;er simply looked at Song Yun with a smile on her lips, not saying a word at all.<br>&ldquo;Alright alright, you also know that I&rsquo;m joking with you! How could I possibly make a move on you over a man? Think about our relationship, you&rsquo;re someone who has watched me when I grew up! We might not be real sisters, but we aren&rsquo;t anywhere far from that.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time now, we need to start making our way back. If we were to be late again, my mother won&rsquo;t be letting me out anymore,&rdquo; Song Yun said cheerfully.<br>She rose to the sky and quickly left the forest.<br>It was just that in the moment that Song Yun turned her head around, Song Xue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s smiling crescent eyes slowly faded. Watching Song Yun&rsquo;s silhouette moving further and further away, a streak of fear flashed across her eyes.<br>&hellip;<br>After a long journey, Chu Feng finally returned back to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>Thinking back, it actually hadn&rsquo;t been too long since Chu Feng left the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, but he still couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a bit nostalgic returning to this land.<br>Humans have roots, and Chu Feng had two of them.<br>One of them was the Nine Province Continent of the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, and the other one was the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>He might not have grown up in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, but it was the place where he finally regained the honor that belonged to him. With his own strength, he erased his title as a trash and became the hero that brought pride to the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Chu Feng might have become the backbone of the Chu Heavenly Clan now, but it hadn&rsquo;t been an easy journey for him to get where he was.<br>Thinking back, when he first returned to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, there were plenty of powers who were bent on making things difficult for Chu Feng. Even when he returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan, there were still many within the clan who tried to scheme against him.<br>From assassinations to despicable ploys, Chu Feng had gone through all of them.<br>Chu Feng might have been the king of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, but he was no more than an ordinary figure in the Great Chiliocosm Upper realm when he first arrived here. Hardship felt like an integral part of his life then.<br>Thinking back on those memories really filled him with deep thoughts, especially when he felt the power currently flowing through his body.<br>He really felt like he had grown a lot.<br>Compared to the last time when he said farewell to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, he had grown a fair bit too, and he was returning as a different man.<br>Even though Chu Feng felt that he still had a long way to go, the strength he currently wielded was more than enough for him to be proclaimed as a god inside a place like the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>&ldquo;The feeling of home sure is great!&rdquo;<br>Standing in front of a teleportation formation, Chu Feng stretched his back lazily before turning around to leave.<br>&ldquo;Is that&hellip; Lord Chu Feng? Everyone, look! It&rsquo;s Lord Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>But before Chu Feng could move, he suddenly found himself surrounded by a huge crowd at the teleportation formation.<br>This wasn&rsquo;t too surprising; after all, Chu Feng was a household name in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. His fame had already far surpassed that of his father and grandfather.<br>&ldquo;It really is Lord Chu Feng! Lord Chu Feng, where are you heading to?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why did the Chu Heavenly Clan suddenly vanish overnight? What happened?&rdquo;<br>The crowd began shooting questions away at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;<br>In truth, Chu Feng knew the reason behind the matter, but he still chose to ask the crowd to find out what they knew about this matter.<br>So, the crowd began to fill Chu Feng in on what they knew.<br>After hearing the story, Chu Feng felt deeply at ease.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan did vanish from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, but it all happened under Chu Feng&rsquo;s arrangements. Needless to say, Chu Feng knew where the Chu Heavenly Clan was at too.<br>&ldquo;The Chu Heavenly Clan is fine, so there&rsquo;s no need to worry. A day will come where the Chu Heavenly Clan will appear before everyone&rsquo;s eyes once more!&rdquo; Chu Feng declared as he rose to the sky.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good that nothing bad has happened, that&rsquo;s a relief!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A day will come where the Chu Heavenly Clan will appear before our eyes once more? Why does it feel like there&rsquo;s a deeper meaning behind that Lord Chu Feng is saying?&rdquo;<br>Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, the crowd looked visibly relieved as they saw him off with their eyes. At the same time, they couldn&rsquo;t help but think deeply into what Chu Feng had said earlier.<br>Just as they had thought, Chu Feng&rsquo;s words did indeed carry a different meaning, and it symbolized a decision that he had already made in his mind.<br>Chu Feng headed straight to where the Chu Heavenly Clan was staying at the moment. It was still within the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, but it was at an extremely discreet location.<br>There were no mysterious flowers or towering tree in the area, looking more like a place where ordinary mortal lived.<br>The reason why it looked ordinary was because this plot of land carried a very thin concentration of natural energies, so it was inevitable that there were hardly anyone living in this area. No cultivator would choose to come to such a place on his own accord.<br>Chu Feng stopped before an empty plain. This was the spot that Xianhai Shaoyu had marked out on the map where he had concealed the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Having arrived at his destination, he took out a scroll given to him by Xianhai Shaoyu that served both as a map as a key.<br>Weng!<br>Unfurling the scroll, blue ripples began appearing at Chu Feng&rsquo;s feet, forming a spirit formation gate.<br>Chu Feng passed through the spirit formation gate and entered another world, a world created using a treasure.<br>There were mountains and streams within this world, and resplendent palaces carrying the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s flag could be seen everywhere.<br>Yet, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart clenched together upon entering this land.<br>He could spot many animals and rare beasts in the area, but somehow, he was unable to find any humans at all.<br>That wasn&rsquo;t just it. He couldn&rsquo;t sense any lingering trace of a human at all, which clearly meant to say that the clan members of the Chu Heavenly Clan weren&rsquo;t here.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re finally here.&rdquo;<br>A voice suddenly sounded.<br>Tracing the voice, Chu Feng turned to look at the mountain peak not too far away and saw a figure standing atop the peak.<br>It was a black shadow that had no facial features at all, be it its nose, eyes, or ears, making it look incredibly eerie.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know who the other party was, but he knew for certain that the other party wasn&rsquo;t a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Who are you? You were the one who captured my clan members?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked grimly.<br>&ldquo;Hehehehehe&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The balck shadow didn&rsquo;t reply. Instead, he began laughing eerily aloud.<br>&ldquo;Did you think that your family would be safe just because you engaged the help of that lad from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan? The only one who can protect your own family is you yourself, but you really disappointed them this time around.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the silhouette of the black shadow suddenly vanished.<br>Seeing this, Chu Feng quickly rose to the sky and headed over to the mountain peak where the black shadow was standing earlier, only to find that the black shadow had disappeared entirely. He couldn&rsquo;t even sense any lingering aura from it in the area at all.<br>&ldquo;Who in the world are you? Why did you capture my clan members? What&rsquo;s your goal?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked anxiously, but there was no response from the other party.<br>This plunged Chu Feng into despair.<br>He hadn&rsquo;t even crossed hands with the other party yet, but he had a strong feeling that the other party&rsquo;s cultivation was way above his.<br>But Chu Feng had never met the other party before, so why would the other party resort to capturing his clan members?<br>And what that made Chu Feng even more anxious was that he didn&rsquo;t know the current plight of his clan members at all, whether they were still alive or dead at the moment!<br></p></div>
