        <h1>Chapter 4871</h1>
        <div>: Daoist Niantian<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those who were still insulting Chu Feng a moment ago were intimidated into silence.<br>The Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster felt gleeful at the situation.<br>&ldquo;As expected of young friend Chu Feng. His method might be forceful, but I like it!&rdquo;<br>The Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster thought that Chu Feng would desperately attempt to cleanse his reputation, but he didn&rsquo;t think that the latter would completely disregard their opinions.<br>To be honest, Chu Feng&rsquo;s action could cause misunderstandings, but what about it?<br>As long as his conscience was clear, what was there to be scared about? None of these little sects had the power to deal with him anyway. It was these people who were foolish enough to become the pawns of the Holy Light Clan.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you sure are brazen! As if your vile acts weren&rsquo;t enough, you dare to threaten the victims in my presence? Do you really think that I dare not to deal with you just because you have backing?&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye spoke coldly.<br>&ldquo;Deal with me? Go on then. What are you hesitating for? I&rsquo;ll put it out clearly here today. I am the one who has a score to settle with you. Even if you wish to let things slip, I have no intention of letting you get away scot-free!&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he reached into his Cosmos Sack, pulled out the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword, and raised it high up. He glanced at the two grand elders of the Holy Light Clan under his feet.<br>Everyone immediately knew what he was intending to do.<br>&lsquo;You dare, Chu Feng!!!&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye bellowed.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you that there&rsquo;s nothing in this world that I dare not do!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword began falling down toward Shengguang<br>and Shengguang Yunyue&rsquo;s heads.<br>&ldquo;Calm down, young friend Chu Feng,&rdquo; a voice suddenly sounded,<br>To everyone&rsquo;s astonishment, the sword that didn&rsquo;t halt at Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s bellow actually halted upon hearing this voice.<br>The crowd quickly turned their eyes over, and they saw a person making his way over a step at a time. The person was still quite a distance away, but the crowd was still able to recognize him.<br>He was a famed figure of the Holy Light Galaxy, Daoist Niantian.<br>Daoist Niantian was an elusive individual in the Holy Light Galaxy. No one knew how powerful he was, but the Niantian Energy was a highly coveted cultivation resource. Due to that, many held him in high regard in the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>Even Chu Feng also took a respectful attitude to Daoist Niantian.<br>It was for that reason that he halted his attack on Shengguang<br>and Shengguang Yunyue upon hearing his voice.<br>&ldquo;Elder, this is my grudge with the Holy Light Clan. I ask you not to interfere in it.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t rush to kill the two grand elders, but he still expressed his attitude toward the latter. He might have stopped his attack out of respect for Daoist Niantian, but it didn&rsquo;t mean that he was going to let the Holy Light Clan off today.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, there&rsquo;s no rush.&rdquo;<br>Surprisingly, Daoist Niantian didn&rsquo;t blame Chu Feng for his hardy attitude. He waved his hand calmly at Chu Feng to calm him down before turning to Shengguang Xuanye.<br>&ldquo;Lord Xuanye, I have a treasure here that can determine everyone&rsquo;s cultivation. There&rsquo;s no expert present who can circumvent the effects of my treasure. If Lord Xuanye wishes to know whether young friend Chu Feng has brought someone with him, I can use my treasure to check it out now,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble you then, Daoist Niantian. I would like to know which miscreant dares to collude with Chu Feng to undermine the order of our Holy Light Galaxy!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xuanye approved Daoist Niantian&rsquo;s actions.<br>To be honest, he was also a little apprehensive of Chu Feng&rsquo;s backing, and he wanted to know who they were. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have wasted so much time on words here. He would have already made a move on Chu Feng by now.<br>Upon receiving Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s permission, Daoist Niantian slipped his hand into his robe and took out a compass.<br>Shoosh!<br>With a grand wave of his sleeves, he tossed the compass into the sky.<br>The compass was only 6 centimeters long at the start, but it expanded swiftly as soon as it was tossed into the sky. Within moments, it had already grown to a humongous object spanning over 30,000 meters in diameter, nearly covering the entire sky.<br>Following that, Daoist Niantian formed a series of hand seals before letting out a roar.<br>Boom!<br>With an intense quiver of the compass, an invisible ripple swept outward into the far distance.<br>&ldquo;The results are out. The strongest cultivator here is no other than Lord Xuanye. Young friend Chu Feng doesn&rsquo;t have anyone to back him here,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>&ldquo;He has no backing? Chu Feng really came here all alone? Where did he find the galls to do that?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was both surprised and doubtful to hear Daoist Niantian&rsquo;s words.<br>No one sane would do something as brainless as this.<br>Daoist Niantian turned to Chu Feng approvingly and said, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you have really surprised me this time around. You actually reached Martial Exalted level within such a short span of time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Martial Exalted level? Am I hearing things?&rdquo;<br>Those words caused a huge stir.<br>Compared to Chu Feng charging here all alone, the growth in his cultivation was even more so shocking. He had actually reached Martial Exalted level?<br>Putting aside those who were unfamiliar with Chu Feng, even those who were close to him were astounded to hear those words, especially for Yu Hong, Yu Yin, Yin Daifen, Fu Feiyue, Tong Wudi, and the other juniors.<br>They couldn&rsquo;t believe their ears at all.<br>They had long known that Chu Feng was a formidable individual. They wouldn&rsquo;t have a sliver of doubt even if Chu Feng were to make consecutive breakthroughs since their parting, but him reaching Martial Exalted level had really blown their minds.<br>This was clearly abnormal!<br>&ldquo;Daoist Niantian, stop mumbling nonsense to mislead the crowd. How could Chu Feng possibly be at Martial Exalted level? Also, we couldn&rsquo;t see anything with that compass of yours at all. How can we trust your words? Are you possibly the one who is colluding with Chu Feng here?&rdquo;<br>A dissonant voice sounded from the Holy Light Clan.<br>Shengguang Xuanye didn&rsquo;t voice any opposition toward the criticism at Daoist Niantian. This showed his skepticism and displeasure toward Daoist Niantian.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doubting me? Very well. Since you want to see the truth, I&rsquo;ll show it to all of you.&rdquo;<br>With a stroke of his beard, Daoist Niantian formed a series of hand seals.<br>Weng!<br>The compass in the sky morphed into a mirror, showing multiple light spots on its surface. These light spots were of varying colors, seemingly corresponding to each of them.<br>The ones that numbered the fewest were the red spots.<br>&ldquo;Look carefully. The red spots represent the Martial Exalted level cultivators present here,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>&ldquo;Is that for real?&rdquo;<br>Based on the result of the compass, one of the red spots happened to where Chu Feng was standing.<br>&ldquo;That compass is your treasure. It goes without saying that you&rsquo;ll be able to fabricate the results.&rdquo;<br>There were still words of doubt directed toward Daoist Niantian.<br>&ldquo;I see. I&rsquo;ll show you the true prowess of my treasure then.&rdquo;<br>Daoist Niantian formed yet another series of hand seals.<br>Boom!<br>The compass began shuddering violently.<br>A ripple appeared on its mirror surface, making it appear like a lake. The ripples grew more and more numerous, and they started to pour down like a waterfall.<br>Following the descent of the ripple, a massive object slowly descended from the compass too.<br>It was a massive formation, but what was more notable were the experts of the Holy Light Clan that descended together with the formation. They stood around the perimeter of the formation like guards on standby.<br></p></div>
