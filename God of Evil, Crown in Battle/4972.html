        <h1>Chapter 4971</h1>
        <div>: An Acquaintance<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior Qiu, Chu Feng isn&rsquo;t an outsider. He&rsquo;s a friend of our Dao Sea,&rdquo; Song Feifei quickly explained.<br>&ldquo;Junior Feifei,<br>Lady of Dao Sea didn&rsquo;t inform us that there&rsquo;s going to be a visitor. You should know how important this matter is. We can&rsquo;t let someone as suspicious as him loiter around here!&rdquo;<br>Senior Qiu took a much more amicable tone toward Song Feifei, just that his attitude remained hard.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, did you come here under my master&rsquo;s invitation?&rdquo; Song Feifei asked.<br>Chu Feng was just about to answer when Shengguang Baimei spoke to him through voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, this brat is just picking a fight with you for no reason. You should say that you were invited by<br>Lady of Dao Sea first. Didn&rsquo;t you mention that you&rsquo;re on good terms with her? You can explain the reason to her afterward.<br>&ldquo;This brat doesn&rsquo;t pose a threat to us, but things could get troublesome if that rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator comes after us.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng thought that it made perfect sense too. He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of the small fry standing before him, but he wasn&rsquo;t sure what was the stance of the rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator yet.<br>If that expert chose to make things hard for him, that would put him in a spot.<br>So, Chu Feng nodded his head and replied, &ldquo;Indeed,<br>Lady of Dao Sea invited me here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I knew it! How else could you have possibly found your way here?&rdquo; Song Feifei exclaimed with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your invitation letter?&rdquo; Senior Qiu stretched his hand forth and asked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have one,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;How can you prove that you were invited by<br>Lady of Dao Sea without an invitation letter?&rdquo; Senior Qiu questioned.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that the other party would continue to pressure him even though he had already said that he was with<br>Lady of Dao Sea. This made him feel displeased.<br>&ldquo;Senior Qiu, Chu Feng is on close terms with our Dao Sea. He won&rsquo;t lie about something like this,&rdquo; Song Feifei spoke up for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Junior Feifei, it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t trust you, but this matter is of grave importance. Our interests are at stake as well. Unless<br>Lady of Dao Sea personally verifies his identity, I can&rsquo;t allow him to enter the city. Men, capture him!&rdquo;<br>Senior Qiu refused to compromise.<br>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do, Senior Qiu! Chu Feng isn&rsquo;t an outsider. How can you capture him?&rdquo;<br>Song Feifei walked over to Senior Qiu&rsquo;s side and pleaded on Chu Feng&rsquo;s behalf. Unfortunately, her plea was of little use.<br>&ldquo;Senior Feifei, carry me.&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, Yaoyao appeared beside Song Feifei and stretched her hand toward her, asking to be carried.<br>Song Feifei doted on Yaoyao a lot. Even though she knew that this wasn&rsquo;t a good time to get distracted, she still accepted Yaoyao&rsquo;s request and carried her up. Then, she turned her attention back to Senior Qiu, wanting to continue speaking up on Chu Feng&rsquo;s behalf.<br>Pah!<br>A shocking sight occurred.<br>Yaoyao hurled her little hand against Senior Qiu&rsquo;s face.<br>Caught off guard, Senior Qiu was struck in the cheek despite the difference in their cultivation levels. It was just that Yaoyao&rsquo;s slap was nothing more than a tickle on the face of a Martial Exalted level cultivator even though she had exerted her full strength.<br>&ldquo;You dare to hit me?&rdquo;<br>The slap hardly dealt any damage, but Senior Qiu still lost his temper. He glared at Yaoyao with hostile eyes.<br>It looked as if he would have killed Yaoyao without any hesitation if not for the fact that there were bystanders around.<br>&ldquo;Yaoyao, what are you doing?&rdquo;<br>Song Feifei was shocked by Yaoyao&rsquo;s action and Senior Qiu&rsquo;s response. She subconsciously took a step back, hoping to protect Yaoyao. Having spent several days together, she knew just what kind of personality Senior Qiu had.<br>She was really worried that Senior Qiu would harm Yaoyao.<br>&ldquo;Yaoyao, hurry up and apologize big brother Qiu!&rdquo; Song Feifei urged.<br>&ldquo;No! That uncle dared to bully my father! Hmph, I was already going easy on him. Wait till I grow older! I&rsquo;ll suck his origin energies dry!&rdquo; Yaoyao exclaimed with a pout as she hurled her little fists indignantly.<br>She didn&rsquo;t think that she had done wrong at all. On the contrary, she felt that she hadn&rsquo;t done enough.<br>Seeing that, a faint smile appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s solemn face. He never thought that a day would come where a young child would stand up for him. It left him moved.<br>&ldquo;Brat, it looks like you&rsquo;re asking for a beating?&rdquo;<br>Senior Qiu grew even angrier upon seeing that Yaoyao wasn&rsquo;t remorseful over her actions at all.<br>&ldquo;Who are you calling brat?&rdquo; Chu Feng bellowed.<br>There was a change in his gaze, but Senior Qiu didn&rsquo;t seem to have noticed it.<br>&ldquo;Did anyone allow you to talk?&rdquo; Senior Qiu spat disdainfully.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t answer. Instead, he headed over to Song Feifei&rsquo;s side and carried Yaoyao over into his embrace before turning to look at Senior Qiu.<br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my daughter. I won&rsquo;t allow anyone to insult her,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Oh, so this brat is your daughter. No wonder she&rsquo;s so ill-bred. That makes you even more unqualified to join us,&rdquo; Senior Qiu sneered.<br>&ldquo;Are you courting death?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s face darkened as he emanated a chilling aura.<br>Everyone shuddered to the aura, including Senior Qiu. When they looked at Chu Feng once more, there was a complicated look in their eyes.<br>They never thought that Chu Feng could emanate such a cold aura. It was so terrifying that it frightened them.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you can teach him a lesson if you can&rsquo;t tolerate it anymore. Even if we have to give up on the heritage, we can&rsquo;t let that bastard trample all over us!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei felt angry just looking at it, so he sent a voice transmission to Chu Feng.<br>As for Chu Feng, he had already made up his mind to teach Senior Qiu a lesson. He had been through so much hardship that insults couldn&rsquo;t hope to faze him anymore, but he couldn&rsquo;t do the same when it came to Yaoyao.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? You look like you&rsquo;re going to murder someone. Are you thinking of killing me? Do you even know who I am? Come, my neck is right here. You can swing your blade down on it whenever you want. But do you dare to?&rdquo;<br>Even though Senior Qiu was intimidated by Chu Feng&rsquo;s chilling aura for a moment there, he quickly regained his composure and became even more arrogant. He even walked up to Chu Feng, pointed to his neck, and provoked him.<br>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s creating a fuss here?&rdquo; a voice suddenly boomed.<br>Chu Feng felt a clench in his heart when he heard the voice. He turned his head over and saw an elder standing on top of the city walls.<br>&ldquo;Why is she here?&rdquo;<br>It was a familiar face.<br></p></div>
