        <h1>Chapter 5724: Now</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening here, people from the Totem Dragon Clan? Why are you bound by the dragon&rsquo;s beard? Are you not descendants of the Dragon Clan?&rdquo; a mocking voice suddenly echoed from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirteen elders were floating in the sky at a distance so far away that it would have been impossible to spot them if one&rsquo;s cultivation wasn&rsquo;t strong enough, though Chu Feng and the others could clearly spot them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These elders were dressed in the same clothes, but they weren&rsquo;t from the Totem Dragon Clan. They were from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him?&rdquo; Chu Feng recognized one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Qin </span><span>Changhong</span><span>, the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s Enforcement Hall Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Chu Feng grasped the secret behind the Nine Heavens Secret Domain, he was transported to one of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s forbidden lands via one of its teleportation gates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He encountered Xia Xingchen, who had betrayed the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect, and shortly after, Qin </span><span>Changhong</span><span>, who was chasing after her. In an attempt to force him to hand over Xia Xingchen, Qin </span><span>Changhong</span><span> had to resort to all kinds of torture means on Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone else in his place would have surely gone mad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t expect to see Qin </span><span>Changhong</span><span> here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Qin </span><span>Changhong&rsquo;s</span><span> position, he stood at the back of the thirteen people, though he paled far in comparison to the three elders standing in front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect doing here?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen were shocked to see the thirteen elders from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect, and some of them could name the thirteen elders. It turned out the three elders standing at the forefront were from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s Ten Immortal Exalted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the crowd was feeling confused, the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief chuckled under his breath. &ldquo;Heh&hellip; </span><span>So</span><span> you are the ones who helped Long Lin deal with us.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words made the others widen their eyes in realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While betrayal from within had caused the Totem Dragon Clan unprepared during the revolt, resulting in them suffering a huge disadvantage, there was another reason behind their defeat. A group of masked men had aided Long Lin&rsquo;s revolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As those masked men had used a diverse array of martial skills, and their weapons didn&rsquo;t indicate their origin, no one knew where they were from. However, the answer was clear now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect was the one backing Long Lin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;As expected of the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Your reaction is much faster than the others,&rdquo; the elder standing at the forefront of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s elders replied with a smile, thinking that there was no need for them to refute the matter anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had come here to eliminate the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>So</span><span> the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect has a hand in this. That explains things&hellip;&rdquo; </span><span>Chu Feng widened his eyes in realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Lin had previously hinted that he had his reasons for not being able to free the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others. Thinking back, it was probably due to the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s involvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect must have demanded something in return for helping Long Lin. Perhaps, Long Lin might have been nothing more than their puppet in this matter, having no say despite being the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he thought about it, the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span> was also present when he caused a ruckus in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. That was also around the time when Long Lin staged a revolt against the Totem Dragon Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chances were likely that the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s </span><span>Sectmaster</span><span> had intentionally headed to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion then to avoid suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was one more question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those nine elders from the Totem Dragon Clan had likely found them through Long Lin&rsquo;s guidance, which wasn&rsquo;t too surprising since Long Lin had demonstrated his grasp over the ancestral dragon&rsquo;s secret skill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how did those from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect find them here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Long Lin tip them off? But would those from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect really listen to Long Lin&rsquo;s orders?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect, you aren&rsquo;t long from being wiped out. I&rsquo;ll make sure you repay the blood my clansmen have shed manyfold,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo; the thirteen elders from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, you appear to be confused. If not for Long Lin disregarding our clan chief&rsquo;s orders and insisting on imprisoning you, you&rsquo;d all have been long dead. Do you think you still have a chance to wipe us out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;To be frank with you, Long Lin is too indecisive for our liking. Despite having betrayed the Totem Dragon Clan, he doesn&rsquo;t harbor any killing intent toward the rest of you. However, not everyone in the Totem Dragon Clan is as indecisive as him. It&rsquo;s not under Long Lin&rsquo;s orders that we found you here. Rather, someone else has given us a tip-off,&rdquo; the person standing at the forefront of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s elders said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Long Xu and the other Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s elders asked at the same time. There was nothing they hated more than the traitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief killed him earlier.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd widened their eyes as they finally understood the full story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long Lin had informed Long </span><span>Tenghui</span><span> and the other eight elders to head over and apprehend them, but a traitor amongst the nine elders had been secretly colluding with the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that didn&rsquo;t matter anymore since the traitor was already dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, are you still able to exert your cultivation? You should be aware that we&rsquo;ll kill you if you don&rsquo;t kill us now. Otherwise, there&rsquo;ll be a great deal of trouble in the future now that we have shown our faces here,&rdquo; the person standing at the forefront of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s elders said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had witnessed how the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief slaughtered Long </span><span>Tenghui</span><span> and the others, but it was uncertain whether the latter could still exert his cultivation, especially with the strengthening of the binding energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was out of wariness that the group had chosen to keep their distance despite showing themselves. They, too, were afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The lot of you think that you can kill me?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glance from the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was enough to shake the hearts of the thirteen True God level cultivators from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect. He was a galaxy overlord, after all, a figure on par with their </span><span>sectmaster</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren&rsquo;t confident in dealing with him even though his cultivation had been restrained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Uwa</span><span>!&rsquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s face suddenly distorted in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His formation had finally been breached by the runes. Runes started emerging from the dragon essence to fuse with the dragon&rsquo;s beard, and his soul ignited into flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dragon essence was torching his soul in order to complete the ritual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It has been a while, young friend Chu Feng,&rdquo; Qin </span><span>Changhong</span><span> suddenly spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hall Master Qin, you know Chu Feng?&rdquo; the elder at the forefront of the group asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of them recognized Chu Feng too, but Qin </span><span>Changhong&rsquo;s</span><span> words suggested that he was personally acquainted with the latter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Immortal Exalted, I do know him. He covered Xia Xingchen when she escaped the sect,&rdquo; Qin </span><span>Changhong</span><span> replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; The elder turned to Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Where is Xia Xingchen now?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng ignored him. He knew he could die at this rate, so he surveyed his surroundings, particularly the dragon&rsquo;s beard rising from the ground to bind him. This secret skill coming from the powerful ancestral dragon had torched his soul, attempting to take his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, he showed no fear. On the contrary, there was a glimmer of anticipation in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like now is the time.&rdquo;</span></p></div>
