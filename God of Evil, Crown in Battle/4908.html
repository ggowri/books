        <h1>Chapter 4907</h1>
        <div>: Hellfire Quick Draw<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Chu Feng had already entered the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium together with Shengguang Xintian, but its interior was a little different from what Chu Feng was imagining.<br>Chu Feng imagined the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium to be a grand palace filled with martial skills and secret arts of all tiers. He thought that its collection would be so great that there would be a need to segregate it with several floors.<br>However, the place he entered turned out to be an empty white formation space. All he could see around him was boundless white space. It looked like he could walk around here for an eternity.<br>Fortunately, there was a bookshelf right in front of him. It wasn&rsquo;t particularly large, but it was filled with over a thousand books that were emanating faint glows.<br>These books weren&rsquo;t made out of paper or bamboo scrolls. Rather, they were formed out of spirit power.<br>They were all Exalted Taboo Martial Skills.<br>Most of them were rank one and rank two Exalted Taboos, but with a swift glance, there were also a couple of rank six and rank seven Exalted Taboos too.<br>There was a single book placed on the highest rack of the bookshelf. It was a rank eight Exalted Taboo.<br>&ldquo;Is this the wealth that the Holy Light Clan has accrued over the years? How terrifying,&rdquo; Chu Feng thought to himself.<br>All Exalted Taboo Martial Skills were incredibly precious. Back when Chu Feng was in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, he had to go through a lot just to obtain a single Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.<br>Yet, there were over a thousand of them here for him to freely pick from, including rank seven and rank eight Exalted Taboos that he had never seen before.<br>It looked like the Holy Light Clan was truly powerful back then.<br>&ldquo;Waaa, big brother Chu Feng! You&rsquo;re truly incredible. There are so many martial skills for you to pick from!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng suddenly felt a soft sensation on his arm. Shengguang Xintian had hugged his arm even more tightly.<br>&ldquo;Say, I might have been happier if it had been Shengguang Menglai who was hugging me like that, but as for you&hellip; Don&rsquo;t you know how awkward it is for me to see you pull such tricks when you aren&rsquo;t even fully developed yet?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng eyed Shengguang Xintian&rsquo;s breasts in disdain.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re only saying those words because you lack experience with women. Don&rsquo;t you think that a woman of my figure is much more charming?&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian replied with a dissatisfied pout.<br>She continued to hold onto Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm tightly.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it looks like you&rsquo;re right. Shengguang Xintian really is interested in you,&rdquo; Yu Sha suddenly spoke up.<br>Chu Feng had mentioned back then that Shengguang Xintian might be interested in him, but she thought that it was utterly ridiculous. However, Shengguang Xintian&rsquo;s current attitude made everything very clear.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind her doing all of these if Shengguang Haoxuan was around. I would be able to anger that brat at least. There&rsquo;s no point since he&rsquo;s not here, and I only find her actions a bother,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>Both Shengguang Baimei and Shengguang Xintian didn&rsquo;t leave a good impression on him. The two of them had tried to take his life at one point in time. Even though Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t pursue the matter, it didn&rsquo;t mean that his opinion of them had improved.<br>Seeing how Shengguang Xintian was insistently trying to stick to him, Chu Feng&rsquo;s lips curled into an evil smile.<br>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid that I might lose control if you stick onto me like this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Well&hellip; what are you going to do to me?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xintian&rsquo;s eyes visibly dilated a little. She was trying her best to keep her calm, but Chu Feng could tell that she had already started to panic.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s evil smile had left her feeling uneasy, such that she had slightly loosened her grip on Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like you can stop me anyway. Besides, you were the one who has been trying to seduce me all this while.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng began moving his hand toward his robes, as if he was about to take off his clothes.<br>&ldquo;Ahh! Big brother Chu Feng, I was wrong!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xintian&rsquo;s face paled right away. She anxiously released Chu Feng from her grip and retreated a far distance away. She was really afraid that Chu Feng would do something.<br>Her flickering eyes showed just how nervous she was.<br>Chu Feng was able to see through her. She wasn&rsquo;t the kind of person to flirt around and carelessly get into relationships. She was just a little playful.<br>Sticking to Chu Feng was within the limits of her tolerance, and she found it fun to watch Chu Feng&rsquo;s reaction too. However, if Chu Feng were to attempt anything that was beyond the limits of her tolerance, she would immediately lose her composure.<br>This improved Chu Feng&rsquo;s impression of her a little.<br>After all, he preferred women who knew how to treasure themselves.<br>&ldquo;It looks like you still don&rsquo;t know me well, Shengguang Xintian. It&rsquo;ll be best for you not to take your jokes with me too far. I don&rsquo;t have any qualms with going all the way. You shouldn&rsquo;t blame me for making a move if you continue sticking to me like that,&rdquo; Chu Feng warned with a frosty tone as he tidied up his clothes.<br>Shengguang Xintian couldn&rsquo;t help but remember what Shengguang Menglai said previously. The latter had told her that she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep a leash on Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Come here. I don&rsquo;t want you to stick to me, but you don&rsquo;t have to stand that far away either.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng waved Shengguang Xintian over.<br>Shengguang Xintian quickly adjusted her mood. She put on her usual sweet smile and began skipping her way over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side. This time, she was much more obedient. She stood by Chu Feng&rsquo;s side, but she made sure to keep an appropriate distance between them.<br>&ldquo;Based on what you said earlier, it seems like the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium would specially pick out martial skills for outsiders like us to choose from. Is that right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s indeed the case. These martial skills have been carefully chosen by the Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium, so they should fit your needs. Most of the esteemed guests we have had usually have around ten manuals to choose from, and I&rsquo;ve heard of one that had nearly a hundred.<br>&ldquo;However, big brother Chu Feng, you actually have a thousand of them here. This is amazing! On top of that, there&rsquo;s even a rank eight Exalted Taboo in there too. It&rsquo;s just that&hellip; why did the Martial Skills Compendium pick out such a difficult rank eight Exalted Taboo for you?&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian said with a frown.<br>She appeared to be dissatisfied with the rank eight Exalted Taboo.<br>Chu Feng had already noticed the rank eight Exalted Taboo by now. It was called Hellfire Quick Draw. If he wanted to know more about it, he would have to place his hand on it.<br>He could currently pick three manuals, and there was only one rank eight Exalted Taboo here. Naturally, no matter how hard it was to practise the rank eight Exalted Taboo or its suitability for him, he would have to pick it.<br>If he could grasp a rank eight Exalted Taboo, he would be able to raise his fighting prowess significantly.<br>However, Shengguang Xintian&rsquo;s response left him feeling a little doubtful as to whether the rank eight Exalted Taboo was really suitable for him.<br>So, he reached out and placed his hand on the rank eight Exalted Taboo manual.<br>Weng!<br>The basic introduction regarding the Hellfire Quick Draw quickly seeped into Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind. He narrowed his eyes, and his lips curled into a smile. It was a look of excitement.<br>He turned to Shengguang Xintian and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. The Holy Light Martial Skills Compendium is truly an extraordinary place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah? What do you mean?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s abrupt words caught Shengguang Xintian off-guard.<br>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m saying is that the martial skills are truly meticulously chosen for me.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng picked up the rank eight Exalted Taboo manual, and the manual swiftly transformed into a small light sphere. He picked up the light sphere and smacked it into his head.<br>In an instant, he was able to receive the full details about the Hellfire Quick Draw, including its cultivation method.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you&hellip; This is too reckless!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xintian was alarmed. She felt remorseful that she wasn&rsquo;t able to stop Chu Feng from picking the rank eight Exalted Taboo.<br></p></div>
