        <h1>Chapter 1082</h1>
        <div> - Divine Lightning&rsquo;s Backlash<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>There was simply nothing that could stop the terrifying Divine Lightning. Even the rocks on the surface of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond that had been bestowed with the protection of spirit formation were being exploded into fiery balls by the Divine Lightnings. They flew all around and up and down. The might of the Divine Lightnings was so frighteningly powerful.<br>However, although the Divine Lightnings were peerlessly powerful, they only continued onward for at most a hundred meters before dissipating. Furthermore, that&rsquo;s for the ones that managed to travel a long distance. For those that didn&rsquo;t, they only traveled for several meters before dissipating. With such a short range, even if the might of the Divine Lightning was extraordinary, it would be of no use if they failed to hit the enemy.<br>However, the range being short was still not the greatest issue. The greatest problem was that, after Chu Feng released these Divine Lightnings, his rosy complexion, his face that used to be filled with energy, in a flash became pale as paper and without the slightest color of blood.<br>As for the five lightnings that flickered in his sharp eyes, they too dissipated alongside the Divine Lightnings released by him. In their place, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes were now bloodshot and lacking any life. At this moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura was severely weak.<br>&ldquo;Woosh.&rdquo;<br>Not only did his aura decline, but even his body was also no longer under his control. In an instant, the<br>Lightning<br>Armor on his body as well as the<br>Lightning<br>Wings on his back disappeared. Even the Azure Dragon Dashing Technique underneath his feet disappeared. As for his body, it had lost all balance. He began to sway in the water and finally fell to the rocks on the bottom of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what happened? Are you alright?&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, Eggy was frighteningly shocked. She could tell that although the power of the Divine Lightnings was overwhelming, it was evident that Chu Feng did not manage to obtain full control over it. Most importantly, Chu Feng had merely released a tiny bit of the lightnings yet his body had already been overloaded. He also received a major backlash as the price of using the lightnings.<br>Regardless of how much Eggy shouted, she was unable to obtain any response from Chu Feng. That was because Chu Feng had already lost consciousness and entered into a state of coma. Moreover, his aura was still rapidly declining, growing weaker and weaker.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, wake up. WAKE BACK UP! Damn it. Why did this happen?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng&rsquo;s state was extremely bad, Eggy also started to panic. Without any other choice, she clenched her teeth and prepared to use a forbidden method - sacrificing herself to forcibly release her special power to help heal Chu Feng&rsquo;s injuries.<br>&ldquo;Buzz&rdquo;<br>Right at the moment of crisis, a bust of movement arrived from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond. It was water, a flow of water. However, it was no ordinary flow of water. The water contained a faint green light and was extremely fast.<br>It arrived above Chu Feng before stopping and then started to descend. Like clothes, it bundled Chu Feng within it.<br>Being covered by the green flow of water, not only did Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura begin to recover, but even Eggy, who was in Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit space, also felt a burst of warmth.<br>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; At this moment, Eggy had given up on the thought of using her forbidden method. That was because she could feel that there was gentle and warm energy that was currently healing Chu Feng. This energy was extremely powerful and extremely effective.<br>However, because Chu Feng had fainted and Eggy was unable to forcibly leave his body, she did not know where exactly this gentle energy that was healing Chu Feng had come from.<br>In the water several thousand meters away from the place where Chu Feng had fainted in was a small and delicate silhouette. It was a little girl with bright eyes, beautiful jet-black hair and snow-like fair skin. It was the little girl that Chu Feng saved from the Orion Monastery&rsquo;s disciple outside of the Immortal Pond.<br>However, this little girl was somewhat different from before.<br>&ldquo;Buzz.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the little girl&rsquo;s pupils were pulled back. Her bright eyes actually began to change. Not only did her eyes turn from black to green, even her hair turned from black to blonde. A pair of pointed ears also emerged from her golden hair.<br>Other than the change in the color of her eyes, hair and the shape of her ears, there was no other change to the little girl&rsquo;s appearance. However, she emitted an extraordinary and fairy-like aura.<br>&ldquo;Heh. Humans, I have a whole new level of respect for you all now.&rdquo; This little girl looked to Chu Feng. Her eyes were squinted as she smiled sweetly. Although her appearance had changed, her mischievous nature remained as it was.<br>After she finished saying these words, her body moved. Ripples appeared in her surroundings. At this moment, the little girl&rsquo;s figure had disappeared. It was as if she was never there.<br>No one knew about what Chu Feng did in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond. At this moment, everyone was standing in the sky above the center region of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond with their gazes fixed upon the tranquil waters of the Immortal Pond.<br>The Immortal Pond had been tranquil for quite some time now and they had been staring at it for quite some time too. However, no one dared to enter the Immortal Pond. Even that Xian Kun did not dare to do so.<br>After all, the scene that emerged from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond was truly too shocking. Especially those five enormous lightning beasts; they appeared to have the power to destroy everything. Everyone present was able to realize that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond being triggered this time around was different from the past. Thus, even the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves did not dare to lower their guard and rashly enter into the water.<br>However, they were also hoping for the person who triggered the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle to quickly appear as they all wanted to know who exactly triggered it and created such an astonishing feat.<br>&ldquo;Look, someone&rsquo;s coming out?&rdquo; Suddenly, someone shouted. At this moment, everyone&rsquo;s eyes shined. That was because a figure indeed appeared in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond and was rapidly flying toward the surface.<br>Seeing that figure that was rushing towards the surface, everyone&rsquo;s hearts jumped to their throats; they were extremely nervous. They knew that the moment that would bring about the greatest amazement was soon to occur.<br>&ldquo;Hualala.&rdquo;<br>An enormous wave appeared on the surface of the water. After that, a figure appeared from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond. As for this figure, it was not Chu Feng. He wore the Orion Monastery&rsquo;s disciple&rsquo;s clothes. It was the genius disciple of the Orion Monastery, Yuan Qing.<br>&ldquo;Senior brother Yuan Qing, it&rsquo;s indeed you. Haha. I knew that the person who triggered the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle is most definitely senior brother Yuan Qing.&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing Yuan Qing, the people from the Orion Monastery immediately burst in exultation. Not only did they begin to cheer nonstop, they even flew down from the sky and surrounded Yuan Qing on the water, grabbed him, and began to throw him in the air to celebrate.<br>&ldquo;Yuan Qing. It&rsquo;s truly him who did that? He&rsquo;s indeed a genius, he actually managed to successfully trigger the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle. This is truly a miraculous feat for us humans. His name shall be recorded in the annals. Everyone will remember the honor that he had strived for us.&rdquo;<br>In reality, it was not only the people from the Orion Monastery that were overjoyed. Practically all of the humans present and even the monstrous beasts were extremely excited.<br>However, compared to the others, Elder Gongsun and the other disciples from the Southern Cyanwood Forest were frowning. A faint unease appeared in their eyes.<br>Although a human triggering the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle was a great deed worthy of celebration, it would be different if the human was Yuan Qing. After all, Yuan Qing had a conflict with Chu Feng earlier. If he was to gain power, then wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that Chu Feng would suffer a calamity?<br>In other words, the Southern Cyanwood Forest would likely be under great pressure.<br>&ldquo;You all&hellip; what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Right at the moment when everyone was cheering excitedly thinking that Yuan Qing was their hero, Yuan Qing, however, had an expression of confusion. He opened his mouth and asked in a puzzled manner.<br></p></div>
