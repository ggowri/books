        <h1>Chapter 4562</h1>
        <div>: A Purgatory<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Wufeishijiedenger&hellip; Who in the world is that?&rdquo;<br>The name rippled across the crowds of onlookers, and soon, they came to a conclusion. No one knew who this fellow was.<br>But if one thing was for sure, this person was definitely of exceptional capabilities. The fact that only he and Chu Feng had managed to enter this world so far showed that.<br>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not right. Look at the light of that weird name fellow, it&rsquo;s a bit different from Chu Feng&rsquo;s!&rdquo;<br>Someone amidst the crowd pointed to Wufeishijiedenger&rsquo;s name and exclaimed.<br>There was indeed a difference in the specks of light between Chu Feng&rsquo;s and Wufeishijiedenger&rsquo;s. Chu Feng&rsquo;s light was flowing with seven different colors whereas Wufeishijiedenger&rsquo;s was flowing with six colors.<br>&ldquo;Does this symbolize something?&rdquo;<br>The crowd felt that there was some reason behind this occurrence, but there was no way of confirming their deduction.<br>Soon enough, another two more specks of light appeared.<br>They were the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s princess, Long Xiaoxiao, and the prodigy whose name once rattled the Holy Light Galaxy, Yu Lie.<br>Long Xiaoxiao and Yu Lie&rsquo;s specks of light were also flowing with six different colors, similar to that of Wufeishijiedenger&rsquo;s.<br>Not too long later, Yin Daifen, Fu Feiyue, Yu Hong, Yu Yin, and the other prodigies made their appearances too.<br>This time around, their specks of light were flowing with five different colors.<br>The number of colors of the specks of lights for those who entered subsequently was even fewer. The majority of the participants had around three to two colors, but there were some who only had on color too.<br>This made the onlookers realize that some of the juniors that had entered the Storm Combat Dragon Ring weren&rsquo;t prodigies at all. They were simply minor figures sent in by some powers in the hopes of getting something good out of this.<br>Their goal was not to do well in the tournament but to obtain the martial skill left behind by the Rampaging Storm Clan.<br>As time passed, it didn&rsquo;t take long for the number of people inside the world to become fixed at 90,000.<br>However, there were at least tens of millions of people who had entered the stone doors earlier. From this, it could be seen that tens of millions of people had been eliminated thus far, and what made everyone even more anxious was that those who were eliminated didn&rsquo;t walk out through the stone doors.<br>They had neither entered the dueling ring nor left the stone doors&hellip; which meant that they could have very well walked to the end of the line.<br>There were some onlookers who were worried about the safety of the participants, but most people were more focused on those who had managed to enter the dueling ring.<br>Of all 90,000 people who managed to enter the world, Chu Feng was the only one who was shrouded in seven-colored light, which showed just how extraordinary he was.<br>&ldquo;This must symbolize some sort of difference between him and the others, right? Could it be a difference in talents?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it really symbolizes a difference in talents, it would mean that the princess of the Dragon Clan is really extraordinary too. Looks like the ranking created by Daoist Niantian is really trustworthy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment, wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that the fellow with that weird name is highly talented too? But we don&rsquo;t know a thing about him at all? Could it be that one of the prodigies had randomly reported his name?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t seem like it though. All of the top prodigies of the Holy Light Galaxy has already been accounted for inside. I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s anyone else that we have left out.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is weird. Who could it be then?&rdquo;<br>The single person who everyone was most curious of was still that fellow named Wufeishijiedenger.<br>&ldquo;Huh, what&rsquo;s going on? Why did they suddenly all stop?&rdquo;<br>It was then that someone realized that the prodigies, who were initially flitting forth with great speed, suddenly came to a halt. This included Chu Feng as well.<br>Boom boom boom!<br>While everyone was still confused as to what was going on, one of the massive dragons coiling around the towering mountain peak began to move.<br>The dragon soared forth from the mountain peak and swiped down toward the ground amidst a trail of blaze.<br>It was a fire dragon!<br>On top of that, its body actually grew several times larger after it left the mountain peak.<br>It first soared around the towering mountain before releasing a deafening roar, along with a massive breath of flames. The flames gushed forth throughout the entire dueling ring, swallowing everything in sight.<br>&ldquo;Look, some of the specks of light have vanished!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment, did someone really die? What in the world happened?&rdquo;<br>Everyone was alarmed. There were indeed some specks of light that had vanished after the flames gushed forth to engulf the entire world. This made everyone realize that there could have been some casualties.<br>However, they couldn&rsquo;t be certain of it either.<br>So, they continued staring at the world intently, hoping to discern anything from it.<br>However, the fire dragon didn&rsquo;t make any other move after that fire breath. It remained coiled in mid-air, but it didn&rsquo;t make any furious roars or release any fire breaths anymore. Instead, it looked more as if it was observing something.<br>At the same time, Chu Feng and the others also stood rooted to the spot, not moving at all.<br>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t they moving? What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>The crowd watched the scene anxiously. Even the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief couldn&rsquo;t retain his composure in this situation.<br>One must know that his successor was currently on the dueling ring right now too!<br>Awooo!<br>All of a sudden, the fire dragon roared furiously once more.<br>Following that, it swiftly released another fiery breath that swiftly engulfed the whole dueling ring once more. This time, the heat intensity coming from the flames was far greater than before.<br>After the flames gushed through the entire world, dozens of light specks were extinguished.<br>&ldquo;Fifteen minutes. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, the interval between each fire breath is fifteen minutes. This is definitely a test for the juniors. Those who don&rsquo;t have the ability to withstand the fire breath will lose their lives.&rdquo;<br>Someone amidst the crowd deduced, and there were many amongst the crowd who agreed with that judgment.<br>Soon, fifteen minutes passed.<br>And in the next moment, the fire dragon released yet another powerful breath of flames.<br>This third breath of flames was even stronger than the second, resulting in hundreds of specks of light to vanish in a flicker.<br>With this, the trial was made clear.<br>After every fifteen minutes, the fire dragon would release a fire breath with greater force than before.<br>Given the rate of increment of casualties, the next fire breath could very well kill off several thousand people.<br>And even if one could withstand the next fire breath, what about the next next one, or the next next next one?<br>One must know that there were only 90,000 prodigies who had managed to enter the dueling ring. At this rate, wouldn&rsquo;t all of them lose their lives?<br>&ldquo;Lord Xuanye, what happened to those juniors who have vanished? Are they dead?&rdquo;<br>At this point, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief couldn&rsquo;t remain idle anymore. He turned to Shengguang Xuanye and asked him.<br>&ldquo;Like I told all of you, the Storm Combat Dragon Ring is an extremely treacherous place. It&rsquo;s the fighting ring reserved for only the most courageous of prodigies. Those who overestimate their own capabilities are only courting their own deaths!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Xuanye didn&rsquo;t give a direct response, but his words had already revealed the fate of those who had vanished.<br>They were all dead!<br>While the crowd already had already guessed it, hearing the confirmation from Shengguang Xuanye still made them feel a clench in their hearts.<br>&ldquo;This is too terrifying! Just what kind of place is that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t a dueling ring but a purgatory!&rdquo;<br>There were many people who regretted allowing their juniors to enter the dueling ring.<br>Even the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sect master, and the others had tight frowns on their foreheads.<br>They were panicking too. They were afraid that Long Xiaoxiao and the others wouldn&rsquo;t be able to survive the trial.<br></p></div>
