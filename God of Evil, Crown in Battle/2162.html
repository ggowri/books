        <div> - Distinguished Guest Treatment<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Aiya, this is a misunderstanding, truly a misunderstanding.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I truly never expected Brother Chu Feng to be this powerful. It would appear that the Ghostfiend Beast was indeed killed by Brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Earlier, it was my fault. I have no eyes, and wrongly accused Brother Chu Feng. I shall apologize to Brother Chu Feng here,&rdquo; The robust man saw the awkward situation and stood forward to try to mediate the situation.<br>However, even though he was nodding and bowing to apologize to Chu Feng, Chu Feng was still in no mood to bother with him.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I am called Tang Yong. I am the third young master of the Tang Family. To be able to get to know Brother Chu Feng here today, it is truly a honor for me, Tang Yong, and our Tang Family.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I hope Brother Chu Feng would not take offense at my rudeness earlier,&rdquo; That Tang Yong&rsquo;s skin was extra thick. Even though Chu Feng was ignoring him, he still continued on.<br>His current expression was completely different from before. Seeing that eager smile on his face caused Chu Feng to feel disgusted. Someone like him was simply too fake.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for Wang Qiang, Chu Feng would truly not want to deal with these people. However, for the sake of Wang Qiang, Chu Feng could only force himself to reluctantly deal with them.<br>Although he felt surprised by it too, Chu Feng began to feel that the person he had the worst impression of at the beginning, that Tang Ying, appeared to be a lot more favorable compared to the rest of them.<br>&ldquo;Can we return to the Tang Family now?&rdquo; Chu Feng continued to ignore Tang Yong and asked Tang Ying.<br>&ldquo;Third brother, can we go?&rdquo; Tang Ying did not dare to make her own decision. Thus, she turned to Tang Yong.<br>&ldquo;Of course, let&rsquo;s set off right away.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, this Ghostfiend Beast. Brother Chu Feng, what sort of price are you planning to sell it to us for?&rdquo; Tang Yong asked. Perhaps he might have tried to seize the Ghostfiend Beast from Chu Feng earlier. However, he would not dare to do so now, and could only offer to purchase it from Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You all only need the bones, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Ehh&hellip;&rdquo; Tang Yong was at first startled by those words. The reason for that was because, according to his knowledge, although Ghostfiend Beasts were hard to find, only their bones were precious. Other than the bones, the rest of the Ghostfiend Beast was simply worthless.<br>Although he did not understand why Chu Feng would ask such a useless question, Tang Yong still smiled and nodded. &ldquo;Yes, we only needed the bones.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Then I shall given them you all for free,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;H-How could we accept such an enormous&hellip;?&rdquo; At this moment, not to mention Tang Yong, even Tang Ying, Luo Tian, Luo Di and the rest of the people from the Tang Family had an enormous change in their expressions.<br>&ldquo;I said that I&rsquo;m going to gift the bones to you all. If you think that you cannot accept it for free, then go ahead and present me with some more Demon Subduing Spring Water.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However&hellip; the meat of the Ghostfiend Beast must be handed to be in perfect condition. Understand?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s absolutely doable,&rdquo; Tang Yong nodded his head repeatedly. At the same time, the rest of the people from the Tang Family also revealed smiles on their faces.<br>They themselves knew best how much their Tang Family needed the Ghostfiend Beast&rsquo;s bones right now.<br>If Chu Feng were to attempt to profit from their misfortune and demand a sky-high price for the bones, their Tang Family would still be willing to accept his demands should they be within their capabilities.<br>Yet, Chu Feng actually only wanted Demon Subduing Spring Water. They had truly never expected this.<br>Afterward, Chu Feng and everyone else began to proceed toward the Tang Family.<br>The city that the Tang Family was located in was much larger than Red Sparrow&rsquo;s City. At the same time, it was also much more majestic and flourishing.<br>As for the Tang Family, they occupied half of this vast city. The region that the Tang Family occupied was all sealed off with spirit formations and tightly guarded. Ordinary people were simply unable to set foot in there.<br>Furthermore, this Tang Family could truly be said to possess countless experts. If it were to be placed in the Holy Land of Martialism, practically no one other than the blind old man and the other Chu Clan&rsquo;s servants would be a match for them.<br>However, Chu Feng was able to sense that although the Tang Family was powerful, they could not be considered to be a huge monster in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. They could only be considered as a family that occupied a region.<br>From this, it was no wonder that Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master looked down on the people in the Holy Land of Martialism like he had. It was true that the Holy Land of Martialism simply could not compare to even the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>As Chu Feng began to meet more and more people from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, he began to realize what was meant by the saying &lsquo;beyond the heaven are higher heavens, beyond the person are stronger people.&rsquo;<br>After arriving in the Tang Family, Chu Feng handed the Ghostfiend Beast to the people of the Tang Family. Furthermore, he had gotten to know that Tang Ying&rsquo;s father, the master of the Tang Family, was seriously injured, and was waiting for the bones of the Ghostfiend Beast to cure his injury.<br>After finding out that Chu Feng was an extraordinary individual, the people from the Tang Family naturally treated Chu Feng extremely well. They did not dare to neglect him in the slightest.<br>However, Chu Feng was not fond of noise. Thus, he drove all of the servants that were dispatched to serve him out. However, he was unable to drive out Tang Ying no matter how hard he tried.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I truly never expected that you were someone from a Heavenly Clan, that you were a wielder of Heavenly Bloodline.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wow, it is no wonder you&rsquo;re this powerful. I&rsquo;ve seen many people with Heavenly Bloodlines before. But, this  is still the first time I&rsquo;ve met a member of the younger generation as powerful as you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In your clan, you must be an extraordinary person too, right? Could it be that you are the strongest member of the younger generation in your clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right, Chu Feng, exactly which Heavenly Clan do you belong to?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be from the Chu Heavenly Clan, right? Could it be that you&rsquo;re someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan that was dispatched to train in our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?&rdquo; Tang Ying chattered nonstop beside Chu Feng. The gaze with which this girl was looking at Chu Feng was filled with even greater adoration now.<br>Chu Feng ignored her. His eyes were closed as he continued to comprehend how to break through the bottleneck to rank two Half Martial Ancestor.<br>&ldquo;Haha, I&rsquo;m joking with you. I know that you definitely wouldn&rsquo;t be someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan. If you were, you would&rsquo;ve mentioned it already.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should be from one of the other Heavenly Clans, right? But, which one though? You should be from the Ying Heavenly Clan right? After all, the Ying Heavenly Clan is the closest to this place,&rdquo; Although Chu Feng was ignoring Tang Ying, Tang Ying continued to talk to herself nonstop.<br>&ldquo;Is the Ying Heavenly Clan very close to this place?&rdquo; Chu Feng opened his eyes and looked to Tang Ying. While Chu Feng was not interested in other things, he was very interested in the Ying Heavenly Clan.<br>After all, Chu Feng knew that the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master that had nearly destroyed the entire Holy Land of Martialism was from the Ying Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;They could be considered to be the Heavenly Clan closest to this place,&rdquo; After Tang Ying said that, her expression changed. She asked, &ldquo;Eh, in that case, you&rsquo;re not from the Ying Heavenly Clan then? Then which Heavenly Clan are you from?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mn, let me guess,&rdquo; Tang Ying placed her hands behind her back and began to waver left and right. She entered deep contemplation.<br>&ldquo;Fifth Young Miss, the Ghostfiend Beast&rsquo;s meat that Lord Chu Feng requested is here,&rdquo; Right at this moment, a message sounded from outside the palace hall.<br>&ldquo;Good, bring it in,&rdquo; Tang Ying ordered. Then, someone pushed in a large basin of meat.<br>&ldquo;This should have been prepared by a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked. Looking at that large basin of Ghostfiend Beast meat, he was able to tell that it was most definitely the work of a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>The reason for that was because even Half Martial Ancestors would not be able to cut the meat this delicately. Although the bones had been removed, the meat had not been harmed in the slightest.<br>It was a bone removing technique. Although it appeared to be simple, it was actually very hard to accomplish. It was something that only a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist would be able to accomplish.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, for the sake of curing my father&rsquo;s injury, we have invited the assistance of a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is that Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist that declared my father&rsquo;s illness to be very difficult to treat, and that he could only provide treatment after father swallowed a powder ground from a Ghostfiend Beast&rsquo;s bones,&rdquo; Tang Ying explained.<br>&ldquo;You needed to invite a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist? A power like your Tang Family does not possess a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was a bit surprised. He had originally thought that the Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist was from the Tang Family.<br>However, after hearing what Tang Ying said, it was clear that this was not the case.<br>However, if a power like the Tang Family was placed in the Holy Land of Martialism, they would be an major existence that not even the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves could match up to. As such, how could they not even have a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist?<br>Could it be that Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists were as rare in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm as they were in the Holy Land of Martialism?<br><br></p></div>
