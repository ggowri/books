        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>The world suddenly tremored as if the world was changing.</span><br><span>By then, Chu Feng had already reached the end of the 98th step and was about to scale the 99th step. He only had two more steps left to reach the peak and claim the key.</span><br><span>However, Chu Feng halted his footsteps at this point.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Has he finally reached his limit?&rdquo; Jie Tian murmured as he stared at Chu Feng. At this point, he was more interested in Chu Feng&rsquo;s failure than whether they could </span><span>obtain the key.</span><br><span>However, Chu Feng then proceeded to take a step forward. His movement looked so leisurely that it didn&rsquo;t seem like it was difficult for him to scale the 99th step at all.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why did he hesitate then?&rdquo; Jie Tian was confused.</span><br><span>The world suddenly shook. Tremendous pressure manifested visibly on the 99th step and charged deafeningly at Chu Feng. Chu Feng&rsquo;s robes and hair fluttered furiously, and his body trembled uncontrollably. His straightened body immediately scrunched up under the pressure.</span><br><span>Yet, his foot remained firmly planted on the 99th step, refusing to back down.</span><br><span>However, Jie Tian didn&rsquo;t see Chu Feng&rsquo;s determination. He only saw the latter trembling in the face of the pressure, and that brought a smile to his face. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all you amount to.&rdquo;</span><br><span>This was what Jie Tian wanted to see. How could someone he looked down on be stronger than him? How could someone else breach a formation he was unable to clear?</span><br><span>He absolutely couldn&rsquo;t permit that! He wouldn&rsquo;t be able to live with that! He had to be the one to breach this formation, or else no one else in the world should be able to do it!</span><br><span>All along, he had always thought that he was the most talented person in the world. He was convinced that there was no one more talented than him. It would be a huge blow to him if Chu Feng breached this formation when he stumbled here.</span><br><span>Grar</span><span>!</span><br><span>A deafening roar suddenly echoed as nine-colored lightning surged out of Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. The tremendous pressure instantaneously unraveled before the nine-colored lightning, shattering Jie Tian&rsquo;s delusion of grandeur and dignity.</span><br><span>That very instant, he could feel Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spiritist bloodline. It was overwhelming, towering above everything else in the world. He was familiar with this sensation. It was the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline!</span><br><span>&ldquo;He&hellip; possesses the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline too?&rdquo; Jie Tian stared at Chu Feng in disbelief.</span><br><span>By then, the latter had already crossed the 99th step to scale the final step and obtain the key. The flight of stairs began to disintegrate as the formation dissipated along with a wisp of smoke.</span><br><span>Both Chu Feng and Jie Tian fell from the sky. Jie Tian&rsquo;s eyes remained firmly on Chu Feng, even after the two of them landed on the ground.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You possess the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline too?&rdquo; Jie Tian asked.</span><br><span>Chu Feng narrowed his eyes as he looked deeply at Jie Tian. &ldquo;You too?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Tian clenched his fists tightly. Those words indirectly answered his question, but that was not an answer he wanted to hear.</span><br><span>Chu Feng noticed that Jie Tian&rsquo;s eyes had suddenly become spiritless after hearing his answer as if his arrogance had vanished into thin air.</span><br><span>Moments later, Jie Tian released his clenched fists, but he fell backward and landed on his bum. He began gasping for air, looking far more tired than he was scaling the steps earlier.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with him?&rdquo; Little Fishy walked over and asked.</span><br><span>She could tell that Jie Tian&rsquo;s condition wasn&rsquo;t caused by the formation but by something else.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He received a shock,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;A shock?&rdquo; Little Fishy was initially confused, but she quickly grasped what was going on and smiled. &ldquo;He deserves it. How arrogant is he to think that he&rsquo;s the best in the world.&rdquo;</span><br><span>She was delighted because she knew that Chu Feng was the one behind it.</span><br><span>Chu Feng sat down on the ground as well.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you waiting for him?&rdquo; Little Fishy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait for a while,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Little Fishy replied as she settled down next to Chu Feng. &ldquo;Big brother, why don&rsquo;t you tell me what you have been through?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;What do you wish to hear?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you start from the moment we parted ways?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;You mean our time in the Eastern Sea Region?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, I want to know everything that has happened to you,&rdquo; Little Fishy replied with a nod.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to jog my memory a little,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he tried to remember the events then. He suddenly remembered something and took out a red jade pendant. &ldquo;Ah. Is this yours?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Woah! It was with big brother?&rdquo; Little Fishy asked in astonishment.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Your jade pendant got me into trouble,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It got you into trouble? What kind of trouble?&rdquo; Little Fishy was confused.</span><br><span>Chu Feng proceeded to tell Little Fishy about the events that had transpired in the Eastern Sea Region and the Holy Land of Martialism. However, Little Fishy wasn&rsquo;t surprised to learn that her pendant had the ability to strengthen monstrous beasts. Clearly, she had known about it.</span><br><span>Even so, she was extremely interested in what Chu Feng had been through.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What happened next? What happened after big brother entered the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?&rdquo; Little Fishy asked.</span><br><span>Before Chu Feng could answer those questions, Jie Tian&rsquo;s voice suddenly echoed, &ldquo;Stop chatting and complete the trial first.&rdquo;</span><br><span>He stood up with a nonchalant expression as if nothing had happened.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Has this trash finally overcome his trauma?&rdquo; Little Fishy mocked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who are you calling trash?&rdquo; Jie Tian glared at Little Fishy.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Cough&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng coughed.</span><br><span>Jie Tian retracted his angry gaze and marched ahead. Chu Feng and Little Fishy followed him. Not too long later, they found their path ahead hindered by a metal door. The metal door was locked, but it had three keyholes.</span><br><span>They had to use the three keys they had previously obtained here.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo; Chu Feng tossed a key to Jie Tian and said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s open it at the same time.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The three of them twisted their keys at the same time.</span><br><span>Kacha!</span><br><span>With a click, the door began to creak open. Blinding starlight shone from the door crack, and it swiftly enveloped the entire passageway as the door opened fully. There was a hall behind the door, and at the center of the hall was a massive bundle of light shaped like a dueling ring.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was unable to peer inside the bundle of light.</span><br><span>However, there was a spirit formation gate and stone tablet in front of the bundle of light. Inscribed on the stone tablet were the trials Little Fishy and Jie Tian had been through, and what they had to do now was to duel each other inside the bundle of light.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Jie Tian burst into laughter. He looked at Little Fishy provocatively and asked, &ldquo;You said that I was trash earlier? Do you dare to fight with me then?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng was just about to speak when Little Fishy suddenly raised her hand to stop him, saying, &ldquo;Big brother, I&rsquo;ll settle my own affairs.&rdquo;</span><br><span>She walked into the spirit formation gate, and Jie Tian followed suit.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you able to enter, Chu Feng?&rdquo; Eggy asked worriedly.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t enter the spirit formation gate,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a frown.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>All of a sudden, there was a loud explosion, and the bundle of light began to dissipate. Jie Tian and Little Fishy emerged from the bundle of light.</span><br><span>Little Fishy skipped up to Chu Feng and smiled like a mischievous child, whereas Jie Tian collapsed in the corner with fractured limbs and severe bleeding from his seven apertures, especially his mouth.</span><br><span>Jie Tian was severely injured, but even so, he continued to stare at Little Fishy in disbelief.</span><br><span>Chu Feng understood Jie Tian&rsquo;s disbelief. Jie Tian definitely was not weak; he was an Immortal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist wielding strength comparable to a rank seven Half-God level cultivator, and he was likely to have heaven-defying battle power on top of that.</span><br><span>Yet, Little Fishy actually defeated Jie Tian in a single blow. It was a completely one-sided match. Just how powerful was Little Fishy then?</span></p></div>
