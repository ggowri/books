        <h1>Chapter 5604: Other Experts?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After casually killing the rank one Half-God level cultivator, Chu Feng looked toward his surroundings and asked, &ldquo;Who else insulted the Ancestral Martial Galaxy earlier?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several people kneeled before Chu Feng and begged for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Milord, please spare us!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of them suddenly lost their guts and turned into frightened rats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you begging for your lives now? You must be confused. I am from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Aren&rsquo;t I the type of person you look down on? Why are you kneeling before me? Where did your dignity go to?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Milord, we know our fault now. We foolishly looked down on your galaxy despite not knowing better. Please forgive our ignorance.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those people cried out of fear. Some of them even slapped themselves, not hesitating to degrade themselves as long as they would be spared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Scram. Don&rsquo;t appear before me ever again,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those people quickly disappeared from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t have even stood forward if not for the fact that they tried to kill Shengguang Xuanye. They were small fry that wasn&rsquo;t worth him making a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only killed the middle-aged man because he wondered what would have happened if the one who had stepped forward today wasn&rsquo;t Shengguang Xuanye but his other friends from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy. Without a doubt, the middle-aged man would have killed them too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Survival of the fittest was the law of the world of cultivation. Most cultivators had no qualms about taking lives unless restrained by a powerhouse. It was not rare for a cultivator to massacre an entire clan just because one of their clansmen had touched a dog they raised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng thought that there was no point in showing mercy to people like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since you don&rsquo;t see other people&rsquo;s lives are valuable, I&rsquo;ll do the same for yours too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng&hellip; Young friend Chu Feng, you&hellip; have already reached Half-God level?&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye exclaimed in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had known that Chu Feng was a prodigy, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t have gone so far to deal with him back then. However, he didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng would reach such a height within such a short period of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend? Do you think you&rsquo;re worthy of calling me that?&rdquo; Chu Feng glanced at Shengguang Xuanye icily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weng!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, Shengguang Xuanye found the scenery around him abruptly changing. He had been transported to an empty plot of land, where there were only two people before him. One of them was Chu Feng, and the other one was the Long Clan&rsquo;s little princess, Long Xiaoxiao.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, you&hellip;&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his weak cultivation, he could tell that the one who had brought him here wasn&rsquo;t Chu Feng but Long Xiaoxiao. Furthermore, Long Xiaoxiao wasn&rsquo;t concealing her cultivation, and the aura she emanated didn&rsquo;t pale in comparison to Chu Feng&rsquo;s in the least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shengguang Xuanye was already plenty shocked to see that Chu Feng had reached Half-God level, and his shock only deepened when he realized that Long Xiaoxiao, whose talent he had deemed to be beneath Chu Feng&rsquo;s, had achieved the same feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, will you leave Shengguang Xuanye for me to deal with?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that Long Xiaoxiao was more qualified to deal with Shengguang Xuanye here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint smile emerged on Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s bloodied and distorted face, as he said, &ldquo;I was truly narrow-minded to have nearly ruined two excellent buds. I truly deserve death. Xiaoxiao, Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s only right for me to die in your hands. I&hellip; deserve it.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes and prepared for death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Shengguang Xuanye, at least you do realize that you&rsquo;re narrow-minded, but Chu Feng and I aren&rsquo;t the same as you. The Holy Valley has helped us greatly, so I&rsquo;ll spare your life today out of respect for them. If you&rsquo;re repentant, you&rsquo;d return to the Ancestral Martial Galaxy and receive the Holy Valley&rsquo;s punishment. Undergo your punishment, turn over a new leaf, and do more kindness in your life to make up for your sins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Alternatively, if you want to continue escaping, go ahead. I won&rsquo;t make things difficult for you. You may do as you please,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao said with a wave of her hand, indicating that she had already said her peace and Shengguang Xuanye should leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shengguang Xuanye couldn&rsquo;t believe what he was hearing. Was this how insignificant he had become compared to them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Chu Feng knew that Long Xiaoxiao was definitely not a soft-hearted person. She was a meticulous, intelligent, and vicious individual. One would be foolish to think that she had nothing but flowers and rainbows in her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Long Xiaoxiao was only sparing Shengguang Xuanye because she didn&rsquo;t want to make things difficult for him. She knew that he was on good terms with the Holy Valley, and it was true that he was indebted to the Holy Valley too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, if Chu Feng had tried to kill Shengguang Xuanye, Long Xiaoxiao would have probably stopped him. She didn&rsquo;t want him to do something he would regret, knowing that he valued his friends greatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing her intention, Chu Feng chose not to interfere in her choice. While he was the type to pay his dues, he wasn&rsquo;t a narrow-minded individual. Admittedly, Shengguang Xuanye&rsquo;s bravery in refusing to insult the Ancestral Martial Galaxy earlier had also impressed him too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, Shengguang Xuanye had protected the dignity and upheld the backbone of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy&rsquo;s cultivators before others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For that, Chu Feng thought that it was fine to spare his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Xiaoxiao, I have long regretted my actions, even before witnessing how powerful the two of you have become. I was narrow-minded. I have let you and the Holy Light Galaxy down. I am a sinner. I&rsquo;ll return and accept my punishment. However, I have a shameless request to make.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Others believe that our Ancestral Martial entrance of the Nine Realms Immortal Region will never be opened, but I know that the two of you will definitely be able to pull it off. I have heard far too many people insulting and looking down on our Holy Light Galaxy. So&hellip; can you allow me to stay till you open the Ancestral Martial entrance?&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng.&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao looked at Chu Feng, hoping to seek his opinion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao has already made herself clear. You&rsquo;re free to go wherever you want to. We won&rsquo;t interfere in your decision,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you!&rdquo; Shengguang Xuanye said as two streams of hot tears flowed from his eyes and mixed with his blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shengguang Xuanye would have never imagined that the ones to uphold the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s dignity were none other than the two people whom he had schemed against in the past. He was thankful that he had failed, or else he would have become a true sinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, it&rsquo;s about time for us to make a move,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao nodded with a brilliant smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was happy, not just because she was excited to challenge the Ancestral Martial entrance of the Nine Realms Immortal Region, but how far she had come to. In truth, she felt cathartic to see Shengguang Xuanye crying tears of regret after she had chosen to spare him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As much as she was desperately trying to become stronger so as to not allow Chu Feng to leave her behind, she was also training hard to protect everyone she cherished. Someone who had once grasped her fate in his hand was now kneeling humbly before her, feeling remorseful for everything had done to her in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, there was nothing more exhilarating than witnessing this change in attitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, the Ancestral Martial entrance lit up. The spirit formation gate turned into a corporeal gate, and the gate slowly creaked open. At the same time, a baritone voice from the Nine Realms Immortal Region announced that the first one to clear the entrance was from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was taken aback. Even Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao were confused too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ancestral Martial entrance had opened even though they had not entered the premises yet. Could this mean that there were other experts around?</span></p></div>
