        <h1>Chapter 3434</h1>
        <div> - A Battle Of Spirits<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You dare to smile? It would appear that if we do not teach you a lesson, you will not know how powerful our Xu Heavenly Clan is.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s smile had enraged the Xu Heavenly Clansmen. As they spoke, even their oppressive might changed. They were planning to attack him.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give you all a word of advice. If you all plan to fight, you&rsquo;d best reconsider it,&rdquo; Faced with the bunch of Xu Heavenly Clansmen that were looking at him with ill intentions, Chu Feng spoke again. When he spoke, his tone became very stern.<br>Even though he was not showing any anger, his eyes looked very imposing. This frightened those angered Xu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>&ldquo;You dare to threaten us? Do you not understand what your current situation is?&rdquo; A Xu Heavenly Clansman asked.<br>&ldquo;Threaten? Since you all knew that I was imprisoned in the Fire Prison, had you not thought of how I managed to get out, and why I am completely unscathed?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that, even now, you all still feel my title plate to be fake?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you people from the Xu Heavenly Clan all lack brains,&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered and shook his head.<br>At that moment, the Xu Heavenly Clansmen looked to one another. A trace of panic appeared in their eyes.<br>They naturally knew about Chu Feng&rsquo;s encounter on the Ice Summit.<br>Actually, they themselves were also very puzzled by why Chu Feng would appear outside and unscathed after being imprisoned in the Fire Prison. This was a very unusual thing to have happen.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words had startled them awake.<br>If they had to explain why Chu Feng would be fine, there was only one possible explanation that was not irrational. That was, the title plate that Chu Feng took out back then was not a fake, but rather a real one.<br>However, that was something that they found very difficult to accept.<br>How could a mere Chu Heavenly Clansman come to possess Lord Wuming Xingyun&rsquo;s title plate?<br>Although they were unwilling to believe it, they started to hesitate.<br>If the title plate Chu Feng took out was real, they had already offended the Tantai Heavenly Clan, and even Wuming Xingyun.<br>Right now, what they should do the most would be to make up for their earlier mistake through meritorious service, and not to make the situation even worse.<br>As such, the Xu Heavenly Clansmen found themselves at a loss as for what to do.<br>Chu Feng had naturally not lied to them. What Chu Feng had said was all the truth.<br>However, at that moment, Chu Feng was feeling rather helpless. Based on his personality, he wouldn&rsquo;t possibly say all this to them. Instead, he would&rsquo;ve directly taught them, a lesson and made them scram.<br>It was merely that the current situation was rather complicated, and not within his control.<br>Ever since he discovered that he was receiving a backlash from the black gaseous flames, not only was his spirit power immediately sealed off, causing him to become unable to unleash any world spirit techniques, even his cultivation began to rapidly decline.<br>This was especially true at the moment. just a moment before, the speed of his cultivation&rsquo;s decline suddenly accelerated. It was as if the heavens were toying with him. Faced with enemies, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation actually instantly fell from Martial Immortal to True Immortal.<br>Although the speed at which Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was declining had finally slowed, a True Immortal-level cultivation was simply no match for those Xu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>The severe degeneration of his cultivation and the complete sealing of his spirit power had caused Chu Feng to become powerless to teach those Xu Heavenly Clansmen a lesson.<br>Thus, Chu Feng had no choice but to scare them, and make them afraid of him so that he could retreat.<br>However, at that moment, Chu Feng was unable to leave just like that.<br>If he were to leave, it would raise suspicions that he was running away. With that, the Xu Heavenly Clansmen would definitely attack him right away.<br>Thus, Chu Feng could only stay there and wait for the Xu Heavenly Clansmen to become afraid of and cower from him.<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, am a reasonable person. I will not insist on killing you all just because you&rsquo;ve done the wrong thing. However, your behavior today has infuriated me again. Yet, even with that, I have decided to give you all another chance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, remember, you all will only have this one chance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can either apologize to myself and my fellow clansman right away. Or else&hellip; your Xu Heavenly Clan will become my mortal enemy,&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke with a stern expression.<br>&ldquo;Who are you trying to scare? Did you take us to be three-year-old children?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you really think that our Xu Heavenly Clan would fear you?&rdquo;<br>The Xu Heavenly Clansmen were furious. After all, they stood with absolute dominance earlier. Yet now, they were forced into such a passive state. This made it difficult for them to either advance or retreat, and had placed them in a very awkward situation.<br>Faced with the even more enraged Xu Heavenly Clansmen, Chu Feng suddenly burst into laughter, his stern expression no longer present. It was a laughter of contempt.<br>His contempt-filled laughter caused the Xu Heavenly Clansmen to calm down again.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s contempt toward them didn&rsquo;t seem to be a disguise. As such, they had no choice but to carefully reconsider the person before them.<br>In fact, it was not only the Xu Heavenly Clansmen that were feeling panicky; even the bystanders started having a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng.<br>It was not only because Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son. Rather, it was due to Chu Feng&rsquo;s performance.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words and manner of bearing could be said to be completely perfect. Even if he wasn&rsquo;t Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, the crowd would still view him in a new light.<br>&ldquo;You all are testing my patience,&rdquo; Chu Feng said. His tone had chance to one of impatience.<br>&ldquo;Did you take us to be fools?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You want us to cower from your mere words?&rdquo; The Xu Heavenly Clansmen spoke coldly. Perhaps because they were lacking in confidence, their voices grew louder and louder.<br>Actually, the current Xu Heavenly Clansmen were feeling less and less confident. Even though they found it difficult to accept, Chu Feng&rsquo;s performance had made them feel with greater certainty that what he said was true. Otherwise&hellip; how could he be so confident?<br>However, the number of bystanders continued to grow. If they were to let Chu Feng go like that, anyone would be able to tell that they were scared away.<br>If what he said was all true, it would not matter.<br>However, if he had lied to them, not only would they become objects of ridicule by the bystanders, but they would also be punished once their clan learned about it.<br>Thus, they were unable to stop halfway anymore, and were trapped in a dilemma.<br>&ldquo;Do you all not understand my words?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng narrowed his brows. Impatience filled his face. &ldquo;You have tested my patience enough now. I will count to three. You can disappear before my sight right away. Otherwise&hellip; do not blame me, Chu Feng, for becoming impolite.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng started opening his mouth again.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before Chu Feng could even let out his first number, a burst of strong wind rose. Those Xu Heavenly Clansmen had actually all disappeared.<br>Witnessing that scene, the expressions of the bystanders and the Chu Heavenly Clansman behind Chu Feng all changed. Then, they looked to Chu Feng with admiration in their eyes.<br>The battle of spirits was won by Chu Feng.<br>As for them, they were all witnesses to it.<br></p></div>
