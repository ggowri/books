        <h1>Chapter 4178</h1>
        <div> - Genius World Spiritist<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;All-seeing Heavenly Master and I are close friends of many years. Besides, this matter concerns Princess Xiaoxiao and young master Nanxun&rsquo;s future. As such, she would naturally be willing to give me face and come to our aid.&rdquo;<br>Even though Elder Ruiyun said those words very casually, one could tell from her face that she was extremely proud of herself.<br>It could be seen that even for her, being able to move the All-seeing Heavenly Master was something that she could be proud of.<br>&ldquo;All that being said, Elder Ruiyun, young friend Chu Feng is indeed quite capable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That girl Xiaoxiao and myself have personally witnessed his abilities.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps we should have him stay and journey together with us. If he ends up being able to help us, it would naturally be the best. If he isn&rsquo;t able to help, it wouldn&rsquo;t affect anything either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, he&rsquo;s a person of the younger generation, less than a hundred years old.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As we all know, there are times when spirit formations have an age restriction.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whilst his world spirit techniques will definitely not match those of the All-seeing Heavenly Master and the others, I dare say that, within the people of the younger generation, very few people would be able to match young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques,&rdquo; said Long Shengbu.<br>&ldquo;Grandpa Bu, Elder Ruiyun and I have actually already considered that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is why we&rsquo;ve invited over two world spiritists within a hundred years of age.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, the two of them have both reached rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only are the two of them my close friends, but they&rsquo;re also renowned genius world spiritists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re unlike this Chu Feng that I&rsquo;ve never heard of before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, with those two genius world spiritists helping us, there&rsquo;s simply no need for this Chu Feng,&rdquo; said Long Nanxun.<br>&ldquo;What are you implying? Are you stating that the world spiritists invited by you will be able to help, whereas the one I invited won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Long Nanxun, are you looking down on me?&rdquo; said Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, how could I look down on you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt you either. I&rsquo;m only afraid that you&rsquo;re being deceived.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, you&rsquo;re still very young. There are simply too many scammers in this vast martial cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, didn&rsquo;t we agree to have Elder Ruiyun and I handle this matter?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You merely need to journey together with us. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about anything else,&rdquo; explained Long Nanxun.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re implying that I will be deceived, whereas you wouldn&rsquo;t. If this isn&rsquo;t looking down on me, what is it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only do you look down on me, but you&rsquo;re also looking down on Grandpa Bu,&rdquo; said Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Cough, cough&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing that, Long Shengbu immediately coughed twice.<br>He seemed to be implying that they shouldn&rsquo;t drag him into their quarrel.<br>&ldquo;That truly isn&rsquo;t my intention&hellip;&rdquo;<br>It was clear that Long Nanxun was very afraid of Long Xiaoxiao.<br>Seeing Long Xiaoxiao becoming displeased, he was so scared that he didn&rsquo;t know how to explain things anymore.<br>That said, he turned to glare fiercely at Chu Feng.<br>That gaze of his made it clear that he wanted to skin and eat him alive.<br>But, Chu Feng clearly hadn&rsquo;t said anything at all.<br>Long Xiaoxiao was the one who was arguing with him. What did this have to do with Chu Feng?<br>Perhaps this was the rumored &lsquo;being struck by an arrow lying down.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Long Xiaoxiao, am a reasonable person.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this. Call over the two younger generation&rsquo;s world spiritists you&rsquo;ve invited and have them compete with Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If Chu Feng wins, tell those two world spiritists you&rsquo;ve invited to scram.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If Chu Feng is to lose, I&rsquo;ll have Chu Feng leave.&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao was someone with a very strong desire to win. Because of that, she ended up proposing such a thing.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re suggesting, I fear that your genius world spiritist will suffer a miserable defeat.&rdquo;<br>Long Nanxun was in complete approval of that proposal.<br>He even took a provocative glance at Chu Feng. His gaze made it seem like he could already see the sight of Chu Feng making a fool of himself.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the two renowned world spiritists you invited over that&rsquo;ll end up pissing their pants in defeat,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao was filled with confidence in Chu Feng.<br>After saying those words, Long Xiaoxiao looked to Chu Feng. She asked, &ldquo;Little benefactor, there&rsquo;s no problem right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No problem.&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled and nodded.<br>He had thought that he was the only helper invited by Long Xiaoxiao.<br>But, looking at the situation, that was clearly not the case.<br>Not to mention the fact that he would only be able to help Long Daozhi return to the Dragon Clan if he ended up being able to help Long Xiaoxiao, it would appear that he would even have to fight for the opportunity himself.<br>That said, if it was only rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation, Chu Feng was truly not worried at all.<br>After all, he was a world spiritist that had unsealed his bloodline&rsquo;s power.<br>Even though he had only comprehended rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation, his world spirit techniques were actually comparable to rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>&ldquo;Little benefactor?&rdquo;<br>To Chu Feng&rsquo;s surprise, the way Long Xiaoxiao addressed him was heard by Long Nanxun.<br>Chu Feng could sense that with that, his gaze had turned even more hostile.<br>After all, &lsquo;little benefactor&rsquo; was a rather remarkable way to address someone. This was even more so when it was being spoken by Long Xiaoxiao of all people. Moreover, she spoke with such familiarity.<br>Because of that, Long Nanxun&rsquo;s enmity towards Chu Feng increased again.<br>But, there was nothing Chu Feng could do about it. Long Nanxun&rsquo;s hostility was not something he had caused.<br>It was a complete accident. But, this sort of accident was extremely common for Chu Feng.<br>Sometimes, this was life. Even if one didn't want to invite trouble, trouble would still come knocking.<br>That said, Chu Feng was not afraid. He had encountered this sort of thing too many times already.<br>But, the one to suffer in the end had never been him. Instead, it had always been the people that came making trouble for him.<br>&ldquo;Two brothers, it&rsquo;s time to come out!&rdquo; Long Nanxun shouted loudly.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after he said those words, two figures flew out from the golden forest.<br>Evidently, the two of them were prepared, and waiting for Long Nanxun to call for them.<br>The two people that flew over were two men.<br>They were both wearing world spiritist cloaks. Their world spiritist cloaks were very precious. They were treasures in themselves.<br>However, their appearances were extremely different.<br>One of them was very fair-skinned and charming. One could tell from a glance that he was a playboy.<br>As for the other, not only was he dark-skinned, but his skin was also very rough. Furthermore, he was a big fatty.<br>His stomach was like Zhu Bajie. It was so large that it was growing horizontally.<br>[1. Zhu Bajie is the pig from Journey to the West.]<br>As the fatty was ugly to begin with, he looked like a humanoid black pig when he stood next to the playboy.<br>He was simply too ugly to look at.<br>That said, the dark-skinned fatty was extremely confident. He looked extremely proud of himself.<br>It seemed as if he did not believe he was any uglier than the playboy. Instead, it seemed like he believed himself to be even more handsome.<br>That said, that was understandable too. After all, changing one&rsquo;s appearance was simply a piece of cake for world spiritists.<br>This would be even more so for a world spiritist of his caliber.<br>The fact that he did not alter his appearance meant that he was truly confident in the way he looked.<br>But, with how confident he was, his aesthetics were most definitely peculiar.<br>Perhaps they were the same as those of Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandma.<br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to Your Highness. We pay our respects to Lord Supreme Elder.&rdquo;<br>After landing, the fair-skinned playboy and the dark-skinned fatty greeted Long Xiaoxiao and Long Shengbu respectfully.<br>Of course, the two of them did not bother to greet Chu Feng and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>That said, even though Chu Feng and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er were not people from the Dragon Clan, he discovered that the treatment that they received was still different.<br>When that fair-skinned playboy and the dark-skinned fatty&rsquo;s eyes landed on Chu Feng, they revealed contempt and disgust.<br>But, when their eyes landed on Fumo Xin&rsquo;er, they revealed a look of appreciation. This was especially true for the dark-skinned fatty. He was so shameless as to wink at her.<br>Chu Feng was astonished by the wink.<br>It turned out that the fatty&rsquo;s sense of beauty was fine. If that was the case, it would mean that he was truly filled with confidence in himself.<br>However, when he winked at Fumo Xin&rsquo;er, she turned green in the face and nearly vomited.<br>Being sought after by such an ugly man was not something she could be proud of.<br>As for the fair-skinned playboy, although he was not as direct as the fatty, Chu Feng could tell from his gaze that he was also interested in Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng sighed in his heart. &lsquo;Perhaps this is the charm of a beauty.&rsquo;<br>To men, beauties would always have a different sort of attractiveness. They would always be able to bring forth a favorable impression.<br>But, it was different for a handsome man...<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, Grandpa Bu, allow me to introduce you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This person here is the North Star Heavenly Master&rsquo;s disciple, Chen Guang,&rdquo; Long Nanxun pointed to the fair-skinned playboy.<br>Then, he pointed to the dark-skinned fatty. &ldquo;As for this person, he is the Heaven-plundering Grandmaster&rsquo;s disciple, Yue Yang.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So young friends are actually the disciples of the North Star Heavenly Master and Heaven-plundering Grandmaster? This old man has actually heard about young friends. It is my honor to be able to meet you today,&rdquo; Long Shengbu said in satisfaction after hearing the identities of the two men.<br></p></div>
