        <h1>Chapter 979</h1>
        <div> - Deciding the Outcome<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>*whoosh*<br>Suddenly, Huangfu Haoyue&rsquo;s eyes emitted a chilly glint as he waved the Fan of Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven.<br>The flames that Chu Feng suppressed once again arose and this time, the flames essentially strengthened. Their very nature changed.<br>At that moment, the flames were truly fierce, and even Chu Feng felt enormous pressure.<br>However, in spite of that, he did not back away. Instead, with a thought, he shouted, &ldquo;Four Symbols Slaughtering Formation!&rdquo;<br>*wuaoo&mdash;*<br>Instantly, four holy beasts dashed out of Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. They madly ran towards the Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven and merged together. They circled around a formation, and as they ran forth, the Four Symbols Slaughter Formation arose.<br>*boom rumble rumble rumble*<br>Its power was limitless. After entering the Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven, they threw the raging flames into chaos. In the end, they completely vanished.<br>After they disappeared, however, the Four Symbols Slaughter Formation did not stop. With its incomparable divine might, they pressed their way towards Murong Mingtian. Exactly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s target was not Huangfu Haoyue, but Murong Mingtian.<br>Right now, Huangfu Haoyue was being bound by the Demonic Soul Seizing Technique. To break it would be very difficult.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes were not there for nothing. On the surface, he was fighting Huangfu Haoyue quite intensely, but in reality, he had been searching for a method to break the binding formation.<br>Finally, Chu Feng reached a conclusion. It was actually very simple if he wanted to break the Demonic Soul Seizing Technique: just kill Murong Mingtian. As the proverbs said, to defeat the thieves, one must first capture their leader. As long as Murong Mingtian was dead, the Demonic Soul Seizing Technique would naturally be destroyed.<br>&ldquo;Dammit. This brat is actually&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Kill him, kill him! No matter what you use, he must be dead!&rdquo;<br>Indeed, Murong Mingtian panicked when he saw the overwhelming Four Symbols Slaughtering Formation pressing towards him. As he backed away, he started howling madly.<br>The killing intent in Huangfu Haoyue&rsquo;s eyes became even stronger. The fan in his hand trembled slightly, and after some odd cries, the fiery-red fire serpents on the fan all rushed out.<br>When the fire serpents were in the fan, they were indeed very small. However, after they left, they were like released demons as they instantly became thick fire serpents several thousand meters long.<br>There were thirty-eight of such fire serpents. The power every single one contained was unimaginably horrifying.<br>After they appeared, they immediately attacked the Four Symbols Slaughtering Formation. They started surrounding it and biting in madness. Then, completely beyond their expectations, the Four Symbols Slaughtering Formation was instantly torn into pieces by the thirty-eight enormous fire serpents. Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation was so easily destroyed.<br>&ldquo;Dammit, this is the strongest technique in the Burning Heaven Church, the Burning Heaven Fire Serpent Formation!&rdquo; Seeing the ferocious fire serpents, Qiushui Fuyan let out an exclamation. Her already nervous face now filled with uneasiness.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Burning Heaven Fire Serpent Formation? Huangfu Haoyue has summoned thirty-eight Burning Heaven Fire Serpents to create the formation?&rdquo;<br>Qiu Canfeng&rsquo;s and the others&rsquo; face changed greatly as well. Their already nervous eyes were covered with a layer of strong fear and uneasiness as well.<br>The Burning Heaven Fire Serpent Formation was a Mortal Taboo martial skill, but not just any ordinary one. It was a Mortal Taboo martial skill cast together with the Burning Heaven Mysterious Technique and the Fan of Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven.<br>In other words, if one wanted to cast this martial skill, the absolute necessities were the Burning Heaven Mysterious Technique and the Fan of Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven. Neither could be lacked and the requirements were extremely high. It was very difficult to cultivate.<br>It was exactly due to the existence of the Burning Heaven Mysterious Technique and the Fan of Raging Flames of the Burning Heaven that the Burning Heaven Fire Serpent Formation was so abnormally powerful. It was even titled as the strongest Taboo martial skill in the Eastern Sea Region.<br>Back then, the pope of the Burning Heaven Church had used this to shock the world and annihilate a race. He turned a preposterous Monstrous Beast race into an eternal sea of fire.<br>Qiu Canfeng and the others had personally witness the scene of the former pope of the Burning Heaven Church cast the Burning Heaven Fire Serpent Formation. All of them, after seeing such a technique, approved of it. They approved of this formation, and agreed it was the strongest Mortal Taboo martial skill in the Eastern Sea Region.<br>However, to know when the pope of the Burning Heaven Church could only summon three Burning Heaven Fire Serpent with all his power. After summoning, he lost all his strength and paid quite a price for it.<br>Yet now, Huangfu Haoyue had actually summoned thirty-eight Burning Heaven Fire Serpent. If they were to become a Burning Heaven Fire Serpent Formation, then its power would simply be unimaginable. It would possibly even surpass an Earthen Taboo martial skill. After all, this was not a normal Mortal Taboo martial skill.<br>*rumble rumble rumble rumble rumble*<br>As they say, &ldquo;The greater one worries, the more likely it comes.&rdquo; When Qiushui Fuyan, Qiu Canfeng, and the others were all concerned about the creation of the Burning Heaven Fire Serpent Formation, the serpents did start to merge together, which they then created a boundless formation of flames.<br>The formation&rsquo;s flames rage and the runes on it shone. It was extremely large, and as it stood vertical in the air, not only did it emit a blinding fiery-red light, it emanated an aura that made the formation seem it could burn through everything. It simply appeared like the sun had fell down the sky.<br>At that instant, the fabrics of space no longer twisted. Instead, they started to merge together.<br>At that instant, the sea not only boiled, it started steaming.<br>At that instant, a powerful pressure engulfed the world. Other than the Misty Peak that glittered in light, not moving in the slightest, nearly everything visible to the naked eye was being twisted.<br>Even the people hiding within the Spirit Formations felt restless. Those with slightly weaker cultivations actually exploded, unable to withstand the power of the Burning Heaven Fire Serpent.<br>In a situation like that, even Qiu Canfeng and the others were forced to increased the defensive strength of the Spirit Formation as they led the crowd back. They knew very well if the Burning Heaven Fire Serpent were to explode, its power would simply be unimaginable.<br>When those far away felt such a pressure, one could imagine how much pressure Chu Feng felt, as he was so close.<br>At that moment, fire permeated the air around Chu Feng. It was in complete chaos, and everything in his surroundings changed. How did he even look like he was standing in the air? It seemed more like he was standing in an endless oven.<br>Droplets of sweat unceasingly appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s skin. They slid down his skin, but before they even made any sizable distance, they were evaporated. Before such high temperature, Chu Feng&rsquo;s face turned red.<br>But even so, he remained calm. With a smile worn on his face, he said calmly, &ldquo;In the end, it seems that I still have to use this to finish it off.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
