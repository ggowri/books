        <h1>Chapter 4255</h1>
        <div> - Full Of Malice<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What Grandmaster Tang Chen says is correct.&rdquo;<br>Old Man Compliance nodded in agreement.<br>What Grandmaster Tang Chen had said was naturally correct. After all, it was the truth.<br>Chu Feng had been chosen by the crowd. It was the crowd who owed him, and not him who owed them.<br>Yet, the crowd was cursing him out. That was something that shouldn&rsquo;t be happening.<br>Sure enough, after Grandmaster Tang Chen spoke, the people that were cursing Chu Feng decreased a lot.<br>But, this did not mean that the crowd agreed with Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>On the contrary, although many people had stopped cursing Chu Feng, they were sneering. Their expressions were truly repulsive.<br>Everyone understood principles, and how they should behave.<br>But, that didn&rsquo;t mean that they would do things according to their principles.<br>Many of the people present still resented Chu Feng. Even though they were no longer cursing him out openly, they continued to curse him out in their hearts.<br>The only reason they didn&rsquo;t dare to curse him out openly was because they feared Grandmaster Tang Chen and Old Man Compliance.<br>&ldquo;Master, brother Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t possibly have encountered some sort of danger, right?&rdquo; Yuan Shu asked Grandmaster Tang Chen with a quiet voice.<br>As Chu Feng&rsquo;s friend, he did not blame Chu Feng in the slightest. Instead, he was very worried for him.<br>The ancient voice earlier had told the crowd that Chu Feng&rsquo;s current circumstances were not good at all. It was because he had encountered some sort of problem in his formation breaching attempt that the oppression the crowd felt increased.<br>&ldquo;The power of this Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain is too powerful. Being here, we are unable to do anything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not to mention us, even if that old codger Ox-nose or the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted were here, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do anything either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s simply too enormous of a disparity between us and the power of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The chess board that Chu Feng entered also happens to be different from the one that Lu Jie entered.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ignoring the fact that we&rsquo;re unable to see his current situation, even if we were able to see them, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to communicate with him to help him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, Chu Feng can only rely on himself,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen felt that the spirit formations in the two chess boards should be similar.<br>But Chu Feng and Lu Jie&rsquo;s strengths were not the same.<br>To Chu Feng, this wasn&rsquo;t fair.<br>Even though he fully acknowledged Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent, breaching spirit formations relied not on talent, but rather the strength that one possessed at the time.<br>Although it seemed like Lu Jie was breaching his spirit formations effortlessly, it still took him quite a bit of effort.<br>A chess board that even a world spiritist that had grasped rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation had difficulty with, it wouldn't be surprising for Chu Feng to be trapped in there.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the final spirit formation now.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Yuan Shu&rsquo;s gaze turned serious and complicated.<br>The reason for that was because Lu Jie had arrived at the final spirit formation of the chess board.<br>Lu Jie had surmounted all the difficulties in his path and had swept everything before him. There were over a hundred spirit formations inside the chess board. Yet, they had all been neutralized by Lu Jie in a short period of time.<br>Even for the final spirit formation, Lu Jie only examined it briefly before beginning to solve it.<br>&ldquo;In the end, Lu Jie is Lu Jie. Once he goes all out, he is still the Holy Light Galaxy&rsquo;s strongest world spiritist of the younger generation.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the confident Lu Jie, Yuan Shu was unable to keep himself from gasping in admiration.<br>At that moment, Lu Jie&rsquo;s strength was being vividly displayed.<br>Even though Yuan Shu was not fond of Lu Jie&rsquo;s personality and character, he had to admit that he was inferior to Lu Jie in terms of strength.<br>The entire time, Lu Jie had been easily defeating all the spirit formations.<br>At that moment, Lu Jie was not only filled with confidence, he also appeared to be very excited. Compared to his normal condition, his condition at that moment condition was even better.<br>Lu Jie&rsquo;s head became clearer, and his movements more delicate and smooth.<br>Although the final spirit formation was very difficult to breach, Lu Jie was slowly disintegrating it.<br>Finally, the last grand formation was breached by Lu Jie.<br>After he finished breaching that spirit formation, Lu Jie finally managed to exit the chess board.<br>The moment Lu Jie walked out from the chess board, the light coming from underground returned back to the ground.<br>With this, everyone present regained their freedom.<br>&ldquo;Success! Lu Jie succeeded!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re saved! We&rsquo;re saved now!&rdquo;<br>Cheers immediately filled the surroundings after the crowd escaped from the restrictions.<br>Praises for Lu Jie also sounded nonstop.<br>Originally, after Lu Jie had entered the chess board, he was no longer able to see what was happening outside, and also unable to hear the voices of the people outside.<br>He had no idea exactly who, between him and Chu Feng, was stronger.<br>However, at that moment he had obtained his answer. Hearing the crowd&rsquo;s voices, he knew that he had become their hero.<br>Although he was a person of the younger generation, he had relied on his own strength, and had saved the lives of everyone present.<br>The outcome of the match was decided.<br>It was him, Lu Jie, that won.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re nothing much either.&rdquo;<br>Lu Jie turned his gaze to the other chessboard.<br>That chessboard was still engulfed in red light.<br>The crowd didn&rsquo;t even know if Chu Feng was still alive.<br>Lu Jie would prefer it if Chu Feng were still alive.<br>The reason for that was because he had already won. Furthermore, it was a complete victory, so much so that he had even won the crowd&rsquo;s hearts.<br>But, if Chu Feng died, that would be it.<br>If he survived, he would have to confront failure.<br>Lu Jie deeply looked forward to seeing the expression of defeat on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;This guy&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Lu Jie&rsquo;s gaze changed.<br>The reason for that was because a figure walked out from the red chessboard.<br>It was none other than Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng? He actually also managed to breach the chess formation?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all surprised to see Chu Feng.<br>They had thought that Chu Feng had died in the chessboard.<br>Of course, they actually didn&rsquo;t care whether Chu Feng lived or died.<br>But, they were still surprised to see that Chu Feng was still alive.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you alright?&rdquo;<br>But, compared to the others, Grandmaster Tang Chen, Yuan Shu and Yu Ting had panicked slightly.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t look well.<br>Lu Jie had walked out from his chessboard formation completely uninjured. But, that wasn&rsquo;t the case for Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng was deathly pale. It seemed as if he was seriously injured. His weak appearance showed that his condition wasn&rsquo;t good at all.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng was in a bad condition, Grandmaster Tang Chen and the others immediately flew towards him.<br>They didn&rsquo;t care whether the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain was dangerous. They only wanted to help Chu Feng treat his injuries.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh---&rdquo;<br>But, right after Grandmaster Tang Chen, Yuan Shu and Yu Ting approached the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain, they screamed in pain.<br>At the beginning, the crowd didn&rsquo;t understand their sudden scream of pain.<br>But, in the next moment, a spirit formation appeared.<br>That spirit formation connected both heaven and earth. It completely sealed off the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit domain.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen and others were standing outside that spirit formation.<br>The reason why they had let out painful screams earlier was because they had collided with that spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that it&rsquo;s impossible to enter now.&rdquo;<br>After seeing the spirit formation, the crowd realized that they&rsquo;d been blocked outside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>Even though they&rsquo;d escaped from the terrifying restriction and threat of death, they seemed to have narrowly missed the opportunity to obtain the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain&rsquo;s inheritance.<br>But Grandmaster Tang Chen was not worried about that at all. Instead, he was worried for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you alright?!&rdquo; shouted Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if I am injured, it is all worth it to see that you all are fine.&rdquo;<br>Although Chu Feng was feeling very weak, he revealed a joyous smile after seeing Grandmaster Tang Chen, Yuan Shu and Yu Ting. He felt joy from the bottom of his heart.<br>After all, he could&rsquo;ve chosen to enter the white spirit formation gate like Lu Jie had. If he had, then it would&rsquo;ve been much easier for him to breach the spirit formations.<br>The reason why Chu Feng had chosen to brave the risks was because he had wanted to rescue Grandmaster Tang Chen and the others.<br>Seeing the smile on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face, Grandmaster Tang Chen and the others felt very uncomfortable and upset with themselves.<br>Had it not been for them, Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t have had to brave such dangers.<br>What brought them the greatest amount of shame was the fact that they only knew that Chu Feng had encountered dangers, but had no idea exactly what sort of dangers Chu Feng had faced in the red chessboard.<br>But, surprisingly, at such a moment, a voice filled with malice exploded in the sky.<br>&ldquo;You were injured because of your own uselessness! What does that have to do with us?!&rdquo;<br>The person who said those words was none other than Grandmaster Luo Tuo!<br></p></div>
