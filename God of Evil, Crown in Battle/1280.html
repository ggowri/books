        <h1>Chapter 1280</h1>
        <div> - Violently Cutting Down Divine Bodies<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Chu Feng suddenly counterattacked. Not only was he extremely imposing and ferocious, his attack was also very valiant. This greatly shocked Zhao Jingang, Qi Yanyu and Tao Xiangyu.<br>At this time, the three of them did not dare to be careless, and began to wholeheartedly attack and rush toward Chu Feng together.<br>As matters stood, the only thing that they could do was to proceed to fight and not retreat. If they, three grand Divine Bodies, were to be defeated by Chu Feng even after joining hands, they would have utterly disgraced themselves.<br>Thus, their attacks were extremely fierce and they had practically gone all out to fight Chu Feng.<br>However, even when faced with the combined attack from the three of them, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze remained firm and a smile was still on his face. Without any hesitation, he entered the battle circle created by the three Divine Bodies and began to fight them in one location.<br>&ldquo;Boom.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom.&rdquo;<br>In an instant, peach blossoms began to swirl in the air, golden light began to radiate all over and flames swept across the sky. The three Divine Bodies&rsquo; Divine Powers were all being displayed.<br>However, even with the rain of blossoms, the dazzling golden light and the burning flames attacking him, Chu Feng, who was wearing lighting on his body, was calmly and effortlessly receiving their attacks.<br>Even though it was one against three, Chu Feng was not at all disadvantaged.<br>&ldquo;Inconceivable!Chu Feng actually managed to increase his cultivation from rank three Martial King to rank seven Martial King!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, he is not at all at a disadvantage even when fighting against three Divine Bodies with only a rank seven Martial King cultivation. Isn&rsquo;t he a bit too powerful?! Could it be that he&rsquo;s also a Divine Body?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, that shouldn&rsquo;t be the case. His lightning did not give rise to abnormal signs. Instead, it directly increased his cultivation. Even though it might appear to be inferior to Divine Bodies, its intrinsic quality seems to be superior to that of Divine Bodies.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, doesn&rsquo;t it mean that the power that Chu Feng grasped is superior to that of Divine Bodies?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Exactly what is the origin of this Chu Feng? How can there be such a powerful person in this world?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that he&rsquo;s an existence who is destined to become the strongest human, like Qing Xuantian from ten thousand years ago?&rdquo; The battle between the four was truly world-shaking. This caused the surrounding crowd to gasp nonstop in both fear and delight.<br>No one had ever imagined that not only did Chu Feng possess a very powerful world spirit, even his own strength was extremely ferocious.<br>As matters stood, countless people of his same generation had begun to admire and idolize Chu Feng, and countless people from the senior generation began to think highly of Chu Feng. At the same time, they were all envious that the Cyanwood Mountain had obtained such an amazing disciple.<br>After a fierce battle, Chu Feng said mockingly, &ldquo;You three, it seems that your Divine Bodies are merely at this level. I am truly disappointed. Are there any more trump cards remaining from you all? If so, it would be best for you to reveal them quickly. Else, I, Chu Feng, will be helping the three of you to do some bloodletting soon.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; To be ridiculed by Chu Feng in such a manner caused Zhao Jingang, Qi Yanyu and Tao Xiangyu to be so enraged that they seemed to be capable of shooting flames from their eyes. Their complexions turned red with anger. However, other than being angry, there was nothing else that they could do.<br>That was because the three of them had gone all-out in their battle earlier. At this moment, not only had they activated their special Divine Powers, they had also taken out their Royal Armaments to strengthen themselves.<br>However, even with that, they were still unable to injure Chu Feng in the slightest. Furthermore, even till now, Chu Feng had yet to use any martial skills, nor did he take out his Royal Armament.<br>Just from that, everyone was able to tell that Chu Feng had not gone all-out. However, even though he hadn&rsquo;t used all of his strength, he was already able to toy with the three Divine Bodies as if they were in his palm. As such, what could the three of them possibly do?<br>&ldquo;Senior brother Bai, quickly come assist us. Let&rsquo;s defeat this Chu Feng together and teach him exactly how tall the sky is and how thick the ground is,&rdquo; Without any other choice, Zhao Jingang turned to Bai Yunxiao.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that the three Divine Bodies are truly no match for Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>After hearing Zhao Jingang&rsquo;s cry for help, the surrounding crowd immediately began to discuss the matter spiritedly. They all felt that Zhao Jingang, Qi Yanyu and Tao Xiangyu might not be able to continue to resist Chu Feng. Else, why would they publicly cry for help?<br>As for Bai Yunxiao, he was standing there very awkwardly.<br>He was a rank eight Martial King. His cultivation was three entire levels above Chu Feng&rsquo;s real cultivation. Even if he were to defeat Chu Feng, it could not be considered as a victory.<br>However, if Chu Feng were to defeat Zhao Jingang and the others, then it would not only be an utter disgrace to them, even he would be utterly disgraced.<br>After considering everything, Bai Yunxiao flipped his wrist, and his Royal Armament spear appeared in his hand. At the same time, he turned to Chu Feng and loudly shouted, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you are truly too arrogant. You declared that you would take us all on by yourself. I, Bai Yunxiao, shall help you accomplish your wish.&rdquo;<br>The intentions behind his words were very clear - he was planning to find justification for joining the battle.<br>After he finished saying those words, Bai Yunxiao no longer hesitated. Holding his spear, he leapt up and entered the fight.<br>&ldquo;Perfect timing.&rdquo;<br>When he saw that Bai Yunxiao had finally joined the battle, Chu Feng actually laughed loudly. With a flip of his wrist, he finally took out his Demon Sealing Sword and took the initiative to attack Bai Yunxiao.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh.&rdquo;<br>After Bai Yunxiao entered the battle, he swung his arms back and forth. This caused his Royal Armament spear to move about like a fierce dragon. His attack was truly ferocious.<br>Even though he did not use any powerful martial skill, or any special methods, merely relying on his Royal Armament spear, his battle power greatly surpassed that of Tao Xiangyu, Zhao Jingang and Qi Yanyu.<br>However, after Chu Feng took out his Demon Sealing Sword, not only did his aura strengthen, his battle power also increased enormously.<br>The Demon Sealing Sword in his hand did not look like a weapon. Instead, it looked more like a group of demons. Not only was it capable of fighting in melee, it was also capable of fighting at range. It was simply omnipotent!<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, since I, Bai Yunxiao, have joined, you will no longer be able to act this arrogant. This battlefield is already dominated by me,&rdquo; As Bai Yunxiao sent ferocious attacks at Chu Feng, he also started to insult him. He possessed the certainty that he would definitely win against Chu Feng.<br>As for Chu Feng, he did not bother to answer Bai Yunxiao&rsquo;s provocative words. Instead, he smiled coldly, and then his movements suddenly changed. Chu Feng had actually used a special movement martial skill.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s speed was extremely fast. His body moved about like an illusion and drifted around without a moment&rsquo;s pause. It was as if he both existed and did not exist at the same time.<br>This was no ordinary martial skill. Instead, it was a Mortal Taboo Martial Skill by the name of Mortal Taboo: Illusion Light Technique.<br>This Mortal Taboo: Illusion Light Technique was one of the Taboo Martial Skills left behind by the Ascension Sect&rsquo;s ancestor. While it was a Mortal Taboo Martial Skill, it was also of an extremely high quality among the Mortal Taboos.<br>Once Chu Feng activated it, his speed instantly increased by several times. His body was like light, capable of traveling wherever he wished in this region of space. His speed was truly frightening. If one must compare, then this Mortal Taboo: Illusion Light Technique was not at all inferior to the Secret Skill: Azure Dragon Dashing Technique.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, Chu Feng was traveling back and forth through his surroundings, as if he were a ray of light. Other than Bai Yunxiao, neither Zhao Jingang, Tao Xiangyu nor Qi Yanyu was able to clearly see Chu Feng&rsquo;s movements. However, even though Bai Yunxiao was able to see Chu Feng&rsquo;s movements, he was incapable of catching up to him.<br>&ldquo;Chi~~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ahhh~~~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, an intense scream sounded from Tao Xiangyu&rsquo;s direction. Turning their gazes to look, everyone&rsquo;s expression changed. Chu Feng&rsquo;s Demon Sealing Sword had streaked across Tao Xiangyu&rsquo;s left arm. As the horrible cut appeared on her arm, crimson-colored blood also began to violently surge out from her fair-skinned arm.<br>&ldquo;Courting death!&rdquo; Seeing Chu Feng injuring Tao Xiangyu before his very eyes, Bai Yunxiao was enraged. He held his spear and charged toward Chu Feng.<br>He was not angry because Tao Xiangyu had been injured. He was angry because Chu Feng had managed to injure her before his very eyes.<br>What he was concerned about was not Tao Xiangyu&rsquo;s safety. Instead, he was concerned about his own reputation.<br>However, even though he was enraged, there was still nothing he could do to Chu Feng. After injuring Tao Xiangyu, Chu Feng changed directions and moved toward Zhao Jingang and Qi Yanyu.<br>After this, Zhao Jingang and Qi Yanyu were struck by Chu Feng in succession. After a bout of battle, their injuries ended up being much more severe than Tao Xiangyu&rsquo;s.<br>One of Zhao Jingang&rsquo;s arms had been chopped off. He had also received three cuts to his body and was drenched in blood from head to toe.<br>As for Qi Yanyu, his state was even worse. He had lost both of his legs and one of his arms. Even one of his ears had been sliced off by Chu Feng. From a single glance, he appeared like a person covered in blood, and had lost all ability to fight.<br>All of this had happened right in front of Bai Yunxiao. Bai Yunxiao had managed to predict Chu Feng&rsquo;s movements every single time, and knew what he had been planning to do. However, he had been unable to stop him at all.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, am I seeing things?&rdquo;<br>Seeing all of this happening before their eyes, the surrounding crowd had their eyes and mouths wide open in indescribable shock.<br>Three grand Divine Bodies could do nothing to stop themselves from being cut down by Chu Feng. It was like they were fish and meat on top of a chopping board. All of this was truly too shocking.<br>If it weren&rsquo;t for them seeing this with their very own eyes, not a single one of them would believe this to be real.<br>However, this scene that no one could believe to be real actually happened. As such, how could they not be shocked?<br></p></div>
