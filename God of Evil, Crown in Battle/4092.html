        <h1>Chapter 4091</h1>
        <div> - Unfair<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the transformation to the Purple Star Variance Realm, Li Mengyue&rsquo;s brows creased into a frown.<br>The scene of what was happening right now simply resembled the arrival of doomsday. Anyone would feel uneasy at the sight of this.<br>Suddenly, an aged voice sounded, &ldquo;Third young miss, are you alright?&rdquo;<br>Even though that voice clearly came from afar, a figure appeared before Chu Feng and Li Mengyue the moment that voice was heard.<br>The speed of this individual was extremely fast.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed upon seeing him.<br>Even though this old man had concealed his aura, Chu Feng could tell that his cultivation was most definitely above his own.<br>He was very possibly a rank five Utmost Exalted-level expert.<br>Furthermore, after hearing the way that old man addressed Li Mengyue as &lsquo;third young miss,&rsquo; Chu Feng knew that this female elder by the name of Li Mengyue was someone with an extraordinary status.<br>As for this old man, he was naturally Pang Youyang.<br>&ldquo;Grandfather Pang, I&rsquo;m alright,&rdquo; said Li Mengyue.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;re alright, it&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;re alright.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He actually dared to injure third young miss, this old man will definitely not spare him,&rdquo; said Pang Youyang.<br>&ldquo;Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s already dead,&rdquo; said Li Mengyue.<br>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo;<br>Pang Youyang&rsquo;s expression changed. A look of disbelief appeared in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Truly?&rdquo; asked Pang Youyang.<br>&ldquo;Absolutely true. How could I lie to grandfather Pang?&rdquo; Li Mengyue asked with a serious look.<br>Hearing those words, Pang Youyang revealed a joyous look as he looked to Li Mengyue.<br>He opened his mouth with the intention of praising her.<br>&ldquo;But, I&rsquo;m not the one who killed him. I wasn&rsquo;t capable of killing him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was my little brother Chu Feng who killed him. He&rsquo;s a man who has grasped the legendary Dragon Transformation Sensation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, it&rsquo;s rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation on top of that,&rdquo; Li Mengyue turned her gaze to Chu Feng.<br>Upon learning that it was not Li Mengyue who killed the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master, a clear look of disappointment flashed through Pang Youyang&rsquo;s eyes.<br>However, upon hearing that Chu Feng had grasped the Dragon Transformation Sensation, he still couldn&rsquo;t help but turn his eyes toward him.<br>&ldquo;Rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation?&rdquo;<br>Pang Youyang began to carefully size up Chu Feng.<br>However, Chu Feng could feel a different sort of feeling from his gaze.<br>Although this Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s expert did not possess any hostility toward him, there was a slight amount of restraining fear in his gaze.<br>Normally, restraining fear was a good thing.<br>However, it just so happened that this old man&rsquo;s restraining fear made Chu Feng feel very uncomfortable.<br>His fear seemed to be a signal of danger.<br>It was like the fear of a vicious ruler when they discovered an unstable element.<br>After sizing up Chu Feng, Pang Youyang introduced himself courteously, &ldquo;This old man is the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Supreme Elder Pang Youyang. It is my pleasure to meet young friend Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng pays his respects to senior.&rdquo;<br>While Chu Feng had realized that Pang Youyang was not holding good intentions toward him, he still smiled and responded courteously.<br>At the very least, before they had a full-on falling out, Chu Feng had to maintain his etiquette.<br>&ldquo;Truly a young hero. Never would I have imagined that you&rsquo;d have such a cultivation at your young age.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You must be the most amazing genius that this old man has ever met in my entire life,&rdquo; Pang Youyang praised Chu Feng repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;Senior is being too modest,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Grandfather Pang, little brother Chu Feng, the two of you should halt the civilities exchange for now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead, quickly have a look as to what&rsquo;s going on inside the Purple Star Variance Realm,&rdquo; urged Li Mengyue.<br>Li Mengyue&rsquo;s gaze had turned to the sky above.<br>It turned out that an even greater change had occurred in the sky above.<br>The vast white clouds in the sky had indistinctly formed a giant face.<br>Even though that face was very vague, and one cannot see the details, it was not emitting any sort of terrifying aura. Instead, it appeared extremely sacred.<br>&ldquo;Lord Youyang!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded.<br>It turned out that a large group of people was approaching.<br>It was the Miao Heavenly Clansmen.<br>After them, the people from the other powers also arrived.<br>Even the Xuanming Family hurried over.<br>Furthermore, all these powers arrived right after each other. In merely a short moment, they were all gathered here.<br>&ldquo;You all, why are all of you here?&rdquo; asked Pang Youyang.<br>After all, these powers were scattered all over the Purple Star Variance Realm before.<br>Thus, Pang Youyang was confused as to why they would all be here so suddenly.<br>&ldquo;It should be their Star-guiding Stones that led them here.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he spread open his palm and looked to his own Star-guiding Stone.<br>There were two Star-guiding Stones in his hand.<br>One was snatched from the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Supreme Elder, and the other was retrieved from the Constellation Immortal Isle&rsquo;s Isle Master.<br>At this moment, both Star-guiding Stones had changed.<br>They were flickering with light. It was like they were being summoned. As for what was summoning them, it was that giant face in the clouds above.<br>&ldquo;It is indeed the Star-guiding Stones that guided us here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, young friend, why would you have two Star-guiding Stones in your possession?&rdquo; The Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief looked to Chu Feng in a confused manner.<br>The others present also looked to Chu Feng with complicated gazes.<br>They were only able to tell that Chu Feng was someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan, but none of them knew exactly who he was.<br>But, they all knew that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Star-guiding Stone was snatched away by the Constellation Immortal Isle, and the Chu Heavenly Clan had been forced to retreat from the Purple Star Variance Realm.<br>That was why they were so confused by Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance, and even more puzzled when they saw that he had two Star-guiding Stones in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Of the two Star-guiding Stones in his hand, one belonged to the Chu Heavenly Clan, and the other belonged to the Constellation Immortal Isle,&rdquo; explained Li Mengyue.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the people from the various powers all revealed different sorts of expressions.<br>Some were feeling shocked, some were feeling unreconciled, and some were feeling anger that they didn&rsquo;t dare express.<br>They believed that it would be impossible for someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan to be able to snatch back the Star-guiding Stone from the Constellation Immortal Isle.<br>Since this youngster from the Chu Heavenly Clan had two Star-guiding Stones in his hand and was standing so close to the people from the Purple Star Hall, there could only be one possible explanation -- it was the Purple Star Hall that had helped him obtain those Star-guiding Stones.<br>Suddenly, a displeased voice sounded, &ldquo;Please excuse this junior&rsquo;s offense.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, didn&rsquo;t the Purple Star Hall say that they would not interfere in the matters inside the Purple Star Variance Realm?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why would the Purple Star Hall be helping the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is unfair, no?&rdquo;<br>The person who had spoken was the Xuanming Family&rsquo;s young master Xuan Yihang.<br>While the others didn&rsquo;t know who Chu Feng was, he did.<br>He had a bone-deep hatred for Chu Feng. Seeing that Chu Feng was being aided by the Purple Star Hall, he felt extremely displeased.<br>Overwhelmed by his displeasure, he actually lost his sense of reasoning and publicly criticized the behavior of the Purple Star Hall.<br>&ldquo;Yihang, do not be rude!&rdquo; A furious shout sounded. It was the Xuanming Family&rsquo;s Family Head Xuan Tianpeng.<br>Xuan Tianpeng was glaring at Xuan Yihang angrily. He was simply itching to give him a beating.<br>The reason why he was so furious was naturally because of Xuan Yihang&rsquo;s impudence, and how he had said something that he shouldn&rsquo;t have before Pang Youyang and Li Mengyue.<br>&ldquo;Lord Youyang, third young miss, I&rsquo;ve failed to discipline my son properly. Please forgive me.&rdquo;<br>The Xuanming Family&rsquo;s Family Head immediately clasped his fist and bent his back at Pang Youyang and Li Mengyue to apologize.<br>However, he soon stood back up and said, &ldquo;However, while my young son&rsquo;s words were rather offensive, they are not without reason.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If the Purple Star Hall did aid the Chu Heavenly Clan, it would be truly unfair to the rest of us.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, everyone realized that this father and son were echoing one another and putting on a performance to indirectly criticize the Purple Star Hall.<br>However, it just so happened that no one blamed them.<br>After all, what the two of them had stated was what all the other powers were thinking too.<br>If the Purple Star Hall had truly aided the Chu Heavenly Clan, there would be no reason for them to continue to stay here and compete with one another.<br>Instead, they should directly leave this place. After all, this was the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s territory. If the Purple Star Hall planned to help a specific power, how could any of them possibly be able to compete?<br></p></div>
