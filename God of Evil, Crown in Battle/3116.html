        <h1>Chapter 3115</h1>
        <div> - Scheme<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo; Tang Zhenghao started to laugh loudly.<br>After he finished laughing, he said, &ldquo;One must not believe in what one hears until one sees it for oneself. Rather than hearing from others, I, Tang Zhenghao, would like to experience it for myself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s not bother with anymore superfluous words. I believe you should already know why I, Tang Zhenghao, came here today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will only ask you this: do you dare to take on my challenge and fight me?&rdquo; Tang Zhenghao asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Since I, Chu Feng, am already here, how could you not know my answer?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Very well, you are frank and straightforward. Since that&rsquo;s the case, let&rsquo;s stop with the talking. Go ahead and reveal your abilities. Let us determine who is stronger.&rdquo;<br>As Tang Zhenghao spoke, he unleashed his Lightning Mark. With his Lightning Mark released, Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s cultivation instantly increased from rank seven Heavenly Immortal to rank eight Heavenly Immortal.<br>Immediately after, blue gaseous flames emerged from Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s body. As the blue gaseous flames revolved around Tang Zhenghao, they formed a pattern. It was a blue ferocious beast.<br>That beast was fierce, frightening and domineering.<br>At the same time, Tang Zhenghao gained a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting a level of cultivation.<br>In other words, the current Tang Zhenghao was capable of fighting on par with rank nine Heavenly Immortals.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, the blue gaseous flames emitted by that Tang Zhenghao are from a treasure. That treasure is similar to Li Anzhi&rsquo;s Golden-grain Inner Armor. It is that treasure that grants Tang Zhenghao his heaven-defying battle power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, from certain viewpoints, that Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s treasure is even stronger than Li Anzhi&rsquo;s Golden-grain Inner Armor. Thus, you must be careful,&rdquo; At that moment, a voice transmission from the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>&ldquo;This junior understands,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>Actually, even without the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s warning him, Chu Feng knew those blue gaseous flames were no simple matter.<br>However, if that was all that Tang Zhenghao was capable of, then no matter how powerful he might be, he was not that much stronger than Li Anzhi.<br>The two of them were actually quite on par with one another.<br>Unless that Tang Zhenghao were to possess a cultivation a level above Li Anzhi, with only those abilities, Chu Feng was still confident in being able to defeat Tang Zhenghao.<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re not holding anything back, I, Chu Feng, will also not hold back.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he unleashed his Divine level Lightning Mark, fused with his Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword and Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe, and took out an Immortal Armament.<br>Although Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was a level below Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s, Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power was already on par with Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s now that he had unleashed all of his abilities.<br>&ldquo;Not bad. It would appear that your reputation is well-deserved. Since that&rsquo;s the case, let us fight to our heart&rsquo;s content.&rdquo;<br>As Tang Zhenghao spoke, he revealed his Incomplete Immortal Armament. Then, he turned into a flash of light. With an enormously powerful aura, he started to rapidly fly toward Chu Feng.<br>Seeing this, Chu Feng did not hesitate. He held his Immortal Armament in hand and flew toward Tang Zhenghao.<br>In the blink of an eye, the two of them collided. Neither of them were using any martial skills. Instead, they were only hacking and slashing at one another with their respective weapons.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>As the two weapons collided, sparks and powerful energy ripples scattered everywhere.<br>Chu Feng did not retreat in the slightest. However, Tang Zhenghao was knocked several meters back.<br>No matter how powerful an Incomplete Immortal Armament might be, it would not be a match for the Immortal Armament in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s weapon was being suppressed.<br>&ldquo;Awesome!!!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, many of the people present began to cheer for Chu Feng.<br>They were not only people from the Chu Heavenly Clan. There were also people from other powers.<br>After all, Chu Feng&rsquo;s opponent was the Tang Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Tang Zhenghao. Thus, Chu Feng represented not only the Chu Heavenly Clan, but instead the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>Right after the two fighters began fighting, Chu Feng gained the upper hand. As people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they would naturally feel joyous and proud of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s continue.&rdquo;<br>However, after being knocked back, that Tang Zhenghao was not only not dejected, he instead seemed to have had his fighting spirit ignited. He clenched his hand around his Incomplete Immortal Armament and began flying toward Chu Feng again.<br>As for Chu Feng, he was naturally not to be outdone either. Holding his Immortal Armament, he rushed forth to face Tang Zhenghao.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, as Chu Feng approached Tang Zhenghao, he suddenly felt an enormous sense of oppression.<br>That oppressive sensation gave Chu Feng an intense feeling of danger and unease.<br>&ldquo;You?!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed. He looked to Tang Zhenghao, who had already approached him. There was a surprised expression in his eyes.<br>Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s aura had increased again. At that moment, Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s battle power was an entire level above Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>Tang Zhenghao had actually concealed his aura.<br>It was unknown how he managed to do it. However, he had most definitely concealed his aura.<br>Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s actual cultivation was not that of a rank seven Heavenly Immortal. Instead, he was a rank eight Heavenly Immortal.<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s surprised expression, Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s lips raised into a smile of having one&rsquo;s scheme succeed.<br>His smile seemed to be saying &lsquo;Chu Feng, even if you&rsquo;ve realized everything now, it&rsquo;s already too late.&rsquo;<br>Too late; indeed, it was too late. At such a close distance, with such an enormous disparity in strength, Chu Feng was no longer capable of continuing his against Tang Zhenghao.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng was already restricted by Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s oppressive might. He could only look on helplessly as Tang Zhenghao&rsquo;s Incomplete Immortal Armament slashed toward him.<br>Moreover, the Incomplete Immortal Armament Tang Zhenghao held in his hand was actually aimed at Chu Feng&rsquo;s neck.<br>He&hellip; was planning to behead Chu Feng.<br>Tang Zhenghao was planning to publicly humiliate Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
