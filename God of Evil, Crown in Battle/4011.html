        <div> - Do Not Blame Me<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;This treasure is truly powerful.&rdquo;<br>Actually, even Chu Feng himself was pleasantly surprised.<br>After activating the little golden person, Chu Feng had gained its power.<br>It was as the Mystic Cave Saints had said, the little golden person had given Chu Feng the power of a rank four Utmost Exalted.<br>However, even though Chu Feng had gained the power of a rank four Utmost Exalted, he did not manage to display it to the pinnacle.<br>That was the reason why Chu Feng was unable to directly defeat the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster when he was fighting him with only the All-heaven Dragon Sword in hand.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that Chu Feng was trying to hold back. Rather, his battle power was increasing nonstop.<br>For the sake of defeating Chu Feng, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had begun to use martial techniques and other abilities nonstop. He was trying to increase his battle power so that he could defeat Chu Feng.<br>However, Chu Feng was unable to use any such techniques.<br>Although the little golden person had given Chu Feng power, it had also restricted his own power.<br>Whilst it was able to increase Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power to that of a rank four Utmost Exalted, it also made it impossible for Chu Feng to use any of his abilities.<br>Not to mention martial skills, secret skills and Immortal Techniques, Chu Feng was also unable to use his Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>If that weren&rsquo;t the case, Chu Feng would be able to use an Incomplete Exalted Armament that increased his battle power, and not a random sword condensed by the power of the little golden person.<br>As such, it wasn&rsquo;t that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t using any of his abilities. Rather, he was unable to use any of them.<br>Originally, Chu Feng had felt very worried with the situation being like that.<br>He had braced himself to fight the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster because there was no other alternative.<br>However, as they fought, Chu Feng discovered that the power of the little golden person was not as simple as it had appeared to be.<br>He began to grasp more of its power, and his battle power had begun to increase nonstop.<br>Even though the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had unleashed his full strength and increased his battle power greatly, he was still unable to defeat him.<br>Chu Feng had now gained absolute superiority in their battle.<br>&ldquo;Milady, are you alright?&rdquo;<br>Han Xiu had arrived beside Zhao Hong.<br>Even though her dantian was damaged, her injury was already greatly alleviated after being treated by Chu Feng.<br>Instead, it was Zhao Hong who still had lightning damaging her body, and was still suffering from the pain and restriction caused by it.<br>That was why Han Xiu had gone over to Zhao Hong to try to alleviate her pain.<br>However, Zhao Hong&rsquo;s gaze was wholly focused on the battle between the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster and Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Xiu&rsquo;er, that Asura, is he that youngster that you spoke of earlier?&rdquo; asked Zhao Hong.<br>Han Xiu had mentioned a youngster called Asura to her before, who had provided enormous help to her Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Furthermore, the voice that Zhao Hong had thought sounded familiar also belonged to that Asura.<br>As such, Zhao Hong had some impression of the name.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Milady. That&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; replied Han Xiu.<br>&ldquo;His friendship with you is quite deep. He&rsquo;s actually willing to come to your aid at such a time,&rdquo; said Zhao Hong as she looked at the battle. Her gaze moving emotionally.<br>She was able to tell that Asura was risking his life.<br>&ldquo;He is indeed a benefactor of my Red-dress Holy Land&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Han Xiu didn&rsquo;t know how to explain things, and could only say that Asura was their benefactor.<br>She had actually never anticipated that Chu Feng would come to their aid in their moment of crisis.<br>In terms of friendship, it would be her Red-dress Holy Land that owed Asura, not the other way around.<br>They had not provided him with a lot of help.<br>Han Xiu didn&rsquo;t understand why the youngster by the name of Asura would go so far for her Red-dress Holy Land, why he would repeatedly come to their rescue and even risk his life to do so.<br>Could it really be because he was Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s friend?<br>&ldquo;Puchi~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a splash of blood sprinkled forth in midair.<br>The All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster rushed back explosively.<br>Not only did he retreat from the battle, he had even fled into the distant sky before finally stopping.<br>Once he fled, the crowd that were unable to tell what was going on in the battle were finally able to see him again.<br>However, when they saw him again, their expressions became complicated. They even felt waves of unease.<br>They were astonished to discover that the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster was panting hard and sweating profusely. Even his complexion had turned pale.<br>He looked like a completely different person from the composed and relaxed individual who had defeated Zhao Hong.<br>Most importantly, his right hand was not only holding onto his All-heaven Dragon Sword, but it was also holding onto his left shoulder.<br>It turned out that his left arm had been severed by Chu Feng.<br>Like Zhao Hong, he had lost an arm!<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a golden ray streaked across the sky and arrived before the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster in the blink of an eye.<br>It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng was planning to press the attack to ensure victory, and began to attack the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster even more ferociously.<br>At that moment, he All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had an ugly expression, and was backing away repeatedly.<br>In merely a couple exchanges, Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword had left multiple bloody wounds on Liu Shuo&rsquo;s body.<br>With the situation like that, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster began to panic.<br>If this were to continue, he would undoubtedly be defeated.<br>Seeing that the situation had become very bad, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster shouted furiously, &ldquo;How much longer are you all planning to stand there and watch?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he is allowed to escape, you&rsquo;ll never be able to retrieve the treasures from the stone case!&rdquo;<br>His shout was naturally meant for the leaders of the five great powers.<br>Hearing his shout, the five leaders exchanged glances.<br>Then, the five of them disappeared simultaneously.<br>When they reappeared, they had surrounded Chu Feng from all sides.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng immediately stopped his pursuit. Holding the golden sword, he gazed coldly at the five leaders.<br>Faced with Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze, the five leaders&rsquo; expressions changed. A slight amount of restraining fear was present in their eyes.<br>They knew how powerful the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster was.<br>When not even he was a match for Chu Feng, they knew that Asura would be very difficult to handle.<br>As such, they did not rashly attack him.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, we&rsquo;re able to tell that you have a friendly relationship with those two ladies. Otherwise, you wouldn&rsquo;t have risked your life to rescue them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, we are unwilling to involve ourselves in your personal grudge with the All-heaven Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the treasures from the stone case belong to us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;re willing to hand them over, we are willing to let the past be the past. As for your grudges with the All-heaven Sect, we are also willing to disassociate ourselves from them,&rdquo; the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said to Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words, the corners of the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster&rsquo;s lips began to twitch repeatedly.<br>What the hell was this?<br>Were they not implying that they were going to disregard what happened to him as long as Chu Feng handed over the treasures from the stone case?<br>However, surprisingly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze remained cold and determined. He showed no intention of compromising.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, whilst it is true that I, Asura, wronged you all by snatching the treasures from the stone case.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I&rsquo;ve stated it before, even if I didn&rsquo;t do anything, the treasures would have ended up in the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As such, I felt that I&rsquo;d wronged you because I&rsquo;m kind-hearted. But, the truth is&hellip; I am totally capable of having a clear conscience.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we are to look at this from another angle, the treasures from the stone case have nothing to do with you all anymore. What I&rsquo;ve snatched were merely the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s treasures.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If seniors are willing to not involve yourselves with the matter here today, I, Asura, will remember your kindness in my heart, and will definitely compensate you in the future.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if you insist on involving yourselves&hellip;&rdquo;<br>When he spoke to you that point, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression became particularly ice-cold.<br>Even the crowd below were able to feel a bone-chilling coldness.<br>&ldquo;...then, do not blame me for being cruel and heartless; do not blame me for unleashing a massacre.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
