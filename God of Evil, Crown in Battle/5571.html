        <h1>Chapter 5571: The Long-awaited Moment</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Little Fishy panicked.</span><br><span>She didn&rsquo;t think Jie Tian would have a treasure that would allow him to devour her all-out attack. That was the final bit of power she had left from the starlight formation. She could only rely on her formation armor after dishing out this attack, but it was nowhere close to being as powerful as the starlight formation.</span><br><span>The fact that Jie Tian had such a treasure was bad news to her.</span><br><span>Fortunately, she soon realized that the black sphere, despite its prowess, could only be used once.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This is the treasure I have saved for the palace. I can&rsquo;t believe I squandered one on you.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Kacha!</span><br><span>Jie Tian took back the sphere and crushed it into bits before directing a murderous gaze at Little Fishy. &ldquo;I gave you a chance, but you refused to take it. Be prepared to die then.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Despite knowing the situation was not to her advantage, Little Fishy paid no heed to Jie Tian&rsquo;s killing intent. &ldquo;You think you can kill me?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> formation armor glowed with brilliant light, and another wave of tsunami formed behind her. In an instant, the entire surroundings were engulfed by the tsunami, and countless sea beasts appeared behind her.</span><br><span>It was her bloodline phenomenon! Its prowess still astounded them even though they had already seen it once.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hmph!</span><br><span>Jie Tian wasn&rsquo;t intimidated by Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> bloodline phenomenon, instead sneering in disdain. Despite having lost the benefit from the traitors&rsquo; power-sharing formation, he wasn&rsquo;t afraid of Little Fishy now that she had lost the starlight formation.</span><br><span>Spirit power enveloped his body by forming a series of hand seals.</span><br><span>Bam!</span><br><span>A surge of black aura rushed forth as if an erupting volcano, enveloping the surroundings. Countless blood-red eyes appeared amidst the black aura. Sinister dark growls echoed as if thousands of monstrous beasts were hiding in the shadows.</span><br><span>Without any hesitation, Jie Tian rushed toward Little Fishy with the black aura formation.</span><br><span>Little Fishy wasn&rsquo;t intimidated by his counterattack at all. The silhouette of the sea beasts behind her also charged forth, creating a momentum that didn&rsquo;t pale in comparison to Jie Tian&rsquo;s.</span><br><span>Boom! Boom! Boom!</span><br><span>The black aura and the tsunami finally crossed each other, giving rise to roaring shockwaves. Both their fighting </span><span>prowesses</span><span> were nowhere as strong as their initial </span><span>clash, but if anything, the fight had only gotten even more intense than before.</span><br><span>The two of them were truly putting their lives on the line now!</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how&rsquo;s the battle going?&rdquo; Eggy asked worriedly.</span><br><span>It was impossible for Chu Feng to track their swift movements through all of the shockwaves, so he could only close his eyes and sharpen his other senses to perceive the battle.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Little Fishy is at an advantage,&rdquo; Chu Feng said, but he frowned moments later. &ldquo;No, something is wrong.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Thousands of figures suddenly rushed out of Jie Tian&rsquo;s body, including the three chief elders. They were the traitors.</span><br><span>Despite having lost the treasure, they still constructed another power-sharing formation to augment Jie Tian&rsquo;s fighting prowess, though it was not as potent as before. Their intervention allowed Jie Tian, who was at a disadvantage, to turn the tables on Little Fishy.</span><br><span>Eggy was anxious upon hearing about that.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you able to find a way to unravel the formation?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t hold on for much longer.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Now that the traitors had left Jie Tian&rsquo;s body, Chu Feng was now able to see the peculiar runes inscribed on their bodies, which he could tell was a method to draw out their energies. However, they had so much energy drawn out of them that all of them had become just skin and bones. Their breathing had also become extremely weak, a sign that they didn&rsquo;t have long to live.</span><br><span>They had paid a terrible price to channel the power-sharing formation.</span><br><span>As Chu Feng expected, it didn&rsquo;t take long for the inflow of spirit power from the power-sharing formation to be reduced. Jie Tian quickly lost his advantageous position against Little Fishy.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What are you doing?!&rdquo; Jie Tian roared at the traitors behind him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Jie Tian, w-we can&rsquo;t hold on for much longer!&rdquo; the emaciated elder weakly cried.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You useless things. I knew that I couldn&rsquo;t rely on you,&rdquo; Jie Tian harrumphed.</span><br><span>He waved his sleeves, and eighteen streaks of light flew forth.</span><br><span>They were the eighteen formation armors. Each of these formation armors was wrapped in a black aura, and their collective might was comparable to Jie Tian&rsquo;s.</span><br><span>Unease flashed across Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> eyes when she saw the eighteen formation armors, as she could tell how formidable they were. In contrast, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes gleamed with excitement.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Finally,&rdquo; Chu Feng muttered as he formed a series of hand seals.</span><br><span>Similarly, Jie Tian was confidently forming a series of hand seals too. As soon as he was done, the eighteen formation armors began moving as if they had come to life.</span><br><span>Little Fishy tensed up, knowing that the tables had been turned against her.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Jie Tian suddenly sneered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, you aren&rsquo;t my target yet.&rdquo;</span><br><span>All eighteen of the formation armors simultaneously charged at Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo; Little Fishy was taken aback.</span><br><span>The protective formation she had left with Chu Feng had been greatly weakened by the dissipation of her starlight formation; there was no way it could withstand the attack of the eighteen formation armors in its current state.</span><br><span>She rushed forth to help Chu Feng, but she was immediately blocked by Jie Tian. In her fluster, she exposed an opening that Jie Tian immediately exploited to land a blow on her shoulder.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You exposed your own weakness over a formation entity? </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er</span><span>, someone as kind as you will never achieve anything great,&rdquo; Jie Tian sneered gleefully.</span><br><span>Several flashes of light suddenly shone behind Jie Tian. They were formation weapons.</span><br><span>It happened so quickly that Jie Tian was struck squarely by a formation blade despite his best attempt at dodging the attacks, resulting in the left arm of his formation armor being sliced off.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Jie Tian was taken aback.</span><br><span>The ones who had just attacked him were the eighteen formation armors.</span><br><span>While Jie Tian was still confused as to what had happened, the eighteen formation armors took their positions next to Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you?&rdquo; Jie Tian widened his eyes in disbelief.</span><br><span>As inconceivable as it was to him, Chu Feng had the chance to tamper with the eighteen formation armors. However, he didn&rsquo;t let down his guard and had made sure to check on the eighteen formation armors afterward, so how could he have missed this?</span><br><span>&ldquo;Looks like you aren&rsquo;t that dumb,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You bastard!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The knowledge that Chu Feng had pulled one over him infuriated Jie Tian. He gritted his teeth and charged at Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Little Fishy tried to stop Jie Tian, but Chu Feng waved his hand and said, &ldquo;You rest for a while, Little Fishy. Let me deal with him in your stead.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng ordered the eighteen formation armors to attack Jie Tian. A furious fight broke out.</span><br><span>&ldquo;A mere formation entity thinks that he can go against me just because he gained control of my formation armors through despicable means?&rdquo; Jie Tian sneered.</span><br><span>He didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng could go against him despite having taken control of the formation armors, but his smile faded within moments. To his shock, Chu Feng was perfectly controlling the formation armors.</span><br><span>Jie Tian was still able to rival the eighteen formation armors at the start, but over the course of the battle, as Chu Feng got more accustomed to maneuvering the formation armors, he began falling into a disadvantageous position.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;</span><br><span>As indignant as Jie Tian was, he knew that he had to make a move here. It was taking his all to deal with Chu Feng; he would be doomed if Little Fishy joined the fray as well.</span><br><span>A vicious glint flashed across his eyes.</span><br><span>With a fling of his sleeves, he tossed a black sphere toward Chu Feng. It was the same black sphere that had devoured Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> starlight formation. It moved so quickly that it practically reached Chu Feng in an instant.</span><br><span>The black sphere then exerted a powerful suction force that devoured not just Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> protective formation but Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power too. Within mere moments, Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power was completely devoured.</span><br><span>Chu Feng swayed weakly on the spot, unable to keep his balance.</span><br><span>&ldquo;A mere formation entity thinks he can oppose me? My treasure doesn&rsquo;t just devour formations; it&rsquo;s also the bane of formation entities like you!&rdquo; Jie Tian sneered.</span><br><span>While he was surprised that Chu Feng could control the eighteen formation armors, ultimately, he was still the one in control here.</span><br><span>Shoosh </span><span>shoosh</span><span> </span><span>shoosh</span><span>!</span><br><span>The eighteen formation armors suddenly charged forth at the same time and stabbed their weapons into Jie Tian&rsquo;s formation armor.</span><br><span>&ldquo;H-how?&rdquo; Jie Tian was stunned.</span><br><span>He thought that Chu Feng would have died from having his spirit power absorbed&mdash;the latter was a formation entity, after all. The formation armors shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to attack him after their master had passed away!</span><br><span>Unable to come to terms with what had just happened, he turned to look at Chu Feng, only to see the latter looking at him with a smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;H-how are you still alive? I should have devoured your spirit power!&rdquo; Jie Tian roared.</span><br><span>Instead of answering the question, Chu Feng took his time to stretch his body before replying, &ldquo;Yes, you devoured my spirit power, but what makes you think that I&rsquo;m a formation entity?&rdquo;</span><br></p></div>
