        <h1>Chapter 4250</h1>
        <div> - The Opening Of The Spirit Domain<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s oppressive might was aimed at the Revered Master Beast Tamer.<br>As a close friend of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, he wanted to get justice for Chu Feng.<br>However, although Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s oppressive might was very powerful, it failed to reach the Revered Master Beast Tamer.<br>It turned out that it had been blocked.<br>It had been blocked by another oppressive might. That oppressive might had come from the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Ghost-face, before protecting him, you&rsquo;d best understand the circumstances.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This Beast Tamer used despicable means to plot against Chu Feng. What he did was completely wretched.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, this old man must definitely teach him a lesson,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Tang Chen, you shouldn&rsquo;t wrongly accuse others.&rdquo;<br>Revered Master Beast Tamer refused to admit what he had done. Furthermore, as the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted was protecting him, he showed no fear towards Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Beast Tamer, are you afraid to admit to what you&rsquo;ve done?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back then, you made a wager with young friend Chu Feng and had your disciple spar with him. If you lost, you&rsquo;d hand him your Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your disciple failed to defeat young friend Chu Feng. As for you, you ended up really handing over the Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain to young friend Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, never would I have imagined that you were so despicable, you old bastard. You actually concealed Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects inside the Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen began to denounce the Revered Master Beast Tamer for his crime.<br>&ldquo;He placed Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects inside the Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s simply too malicious.&rdquo;<br>After hearing Grandmaster Tang Chen's words, the crowd gasped at how ruthless the Revered Master Beast Tamer was.<br>&ldquo;Tang Chen, what you&rsquo;re doing here is an act of venomous slander!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You were clearly the one that plundered my Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain. Yet, you&rsquo;re actually framing me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if you are to frame me, you should think of a better story. You actually said that I hid Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects in my Incomplete Maps?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I believe everyone here knows what sort of existences the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects are.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I had truly placed Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects in my Incomplete Maps, how could this Chu Feng still be able to stand here unscathed?&rdquo;<br>"if that was the case he would be a corpse already.&rdquo;<br>Not only did Revered Master Beast Tamer not admit to what he had done, but instead rebutted Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>It just so happened that the crowd didn't think his words to be completely baseless.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that they didn&rsquo;t believe in Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s character. It was just that they also knew about the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects.<br>Because of that, they knew how dangerous the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects were.<br>Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent was exceptional, his cultivation was still limited. At his cultivation, if the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects entered his body, he would undoubtedly be killed.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. However, due to Chu Feng&rsquo;s exceptional talent, he managed to refine the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects. That is why he is safe and sound,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Refine the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding.&rdquo;<br>The crowd burst into an uproar. Most of them didn't believe that such a thing was possible.<br>The Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects were infamous. Their terror had been validated through the lives of countless people.<br>No matter how exceptional Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent might be, the crowd still didn&rsquo;t think that he would be able to refine the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects using only his talent.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, you hear this? What sort of nonsense is this?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He actually said that someone could use their talent to refine Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Tang Chen, even your lies are so elaborate. You&rsquo;re simply taking us for fools.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone, you should all now know who is actually lying, who is actually making false accusations,&rdquo; Revered Master Beast Tamer said complacently.<br>Suddenly, a flirtatious voice sounded, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that as long as young friend Chu Feng is able to refine Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects, it would mean that Tang Chen wasn&rsquo;t lying, that you&rsquo;re the one that&rsquo;s lying instead?&rdquo;<br>It was Celestial Fairy Muzhi.<br>&ldquo;Humph. Even if he is able to refine Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects, that still wouldn&rsquo;t prove that I plotted against him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The truth is, Tang Chen plundered my Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain&rsquo;s Incomplete Maps.&rdquo;<br>Revered Master Beast Tamer continued to quibble. However, he was no longer as confident as before.<br>He had also started to panic. After all, it was a fact that Chu Feng was standing there completely unscathed.<br>Although he had no idea how Chu Feng had been able to avoid death from the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects, what if what Grandmaster Tang Chen had said was the truth?<br>He was unwilling to use the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects to prove who was lying.<br>&ldquo;Beast Tamer, by speaking like that, you&rsquo;re showing that you have a guilty conscience,&rdquo; Celestial Fairy Muzhi said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Why would I have a guilty conscience? Tang Chen was the one who plundered my Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain and then framed me,&rdquo; said Revered Master Beast Tamer.<br>&ldquo;What proof do you have that it was Tang Chen who plundered your Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain?&rdquo; asked Celestial Fairy Muzhi.<br>&ldquo;My disciple can testify for me,&rdquo; said Revered Master Beast Tamer.<br>Hearing that, Celestial Fairy Muzhi shook her head repeatedly.<br>There were even people among the crowd that couldn&rsquo;t keep themselves from bursting into laughter.<br>To have his disciple testify for him, this was simply too ridiculous.<br>The truth was, with how things were playing out, the crowd were already able to determine who was lying just by comparing the character of Grandmaster Tang Chen and Revered Master Beast Tamer.<br>According to their past behavior and their character's, Grandmaster Tang Chen was most definitely not the lying one.<br>That said, Grandmaster Tang Chen saying that Chu Feng had refined the Realm&rsquo;s Ghost Talisman Insects using his talent was still too unrealistic.<br>Because of that, the crowd also felt that his words weren't completely trustworthy.<br>Seeing that Revered Master Beast Tamer continued to quibble, Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s complexion turned increasingly gloomy. He was planning to speak again. It seemed like he was determined to make him admit to his wrongdoings.<br>But, before he said anything, Chu Feng spoke, &ldquo;Senior, there&rsquo;s no need to bother speaking with someone as vile and lowly as him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, that&rsquo;s a personal grudge between him and I. In the future, this junior will settle this matter with him personally.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We can let him get away with it today,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng did not wish for Grandmaster Tang Chen to continue arguing with Revered Master Beast Tamer.<br>And, more than that, he did not wish for Grandmaster Tang Chen to fight the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted because of him.<br>He wanted to settle his own business himself.<br>&ldquo;No. This old man was present that day when he plotted against you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was my negligence that I failed to protect you. Thus, this matter is not only your business, it is also this old man&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Grandmaster Tang Chen strengthened his oppressive might. It moved toward Revered Master Beast Tamer from all directions.<br>But, his oppressive might was still blocked by the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Tang Chen, Beast Tamer is my close friend. I don&rsquo;t care what sort of conflict the two of you have, and I also don&rsquo;t care who is wrong and who is right. But&hellip; you must give me face today. At the very least, do not attack him before me,&rdquo; said the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted.<br>&ldquo;And what if I insist on attacking him?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Are you planning to refuse the face that is given to you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph. Very well, you can give it a try. See if you can pass by me,&rdquo; the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s face also turned gloomy.<br>As his face was strange-looking to begin with and his voice sounded like a woman&rsquo;s, when his complexion turned gloomy, he looked rather terrifying.<br>Who was Grandmaster Tang Chen? How could he possibly fear the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted?<br>Tit for tat, neither man showed any intention of backing down.<br>As their invisible oppressive might collided, the surrounding space started to shatter and sway. Waves of oppressive might began to sweep across the region.<br>The two men had yet to begin fighting for real. Yet, many people present were already being affected by their oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;Rumble---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, rumbling noises sounded from the direction of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>Looking over, the crowd&rsquo;s eyes lit up<br>The ground beneath the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain had begun to shatter and crumble.<br>From the crumbled ground, from the cracks in the earth, light emerged.<br>The light soared into the sky.<br>Soon, the light pierced through the clouds and shot straight into the rim of the sky.<br>Seeing the change that had occurred, the crowd all became excited.<br>Even Grandmaster Tang Chen and the Ghost-faced Heavenly Exalted stopped their fighting and looked to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>The light was very sacred.<br>As it was released from deep under the ground of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain, everyone realized that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain that they had looked forward to for so long, had finally opened!<br></p></div>
