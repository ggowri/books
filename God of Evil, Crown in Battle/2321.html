        <div> - Controlling The Slaughtering Formation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Afterward, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong began to use the spirit formation the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother had left behind to continue to undo the seal on the grand formation.<br>With the strength the three of them possessed and the spirit formation left behind by the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors, it should be enough for them to undo the seal on the grand formation.<br>Furthermore, the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother had left four treasures that were capable of increasing world spiritsts&rsquo; abilities in operating a spirit formation for her sons.<br>Thus, with the assistance of the treasures, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong used merely an hour in order to undo the seal on the grand formation.<br>&ldquo;Crack~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Crack~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Crack~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Crack~~~&rdquo;<br>&hellip;...<br>At this moment, the grand formation was changing rapidly. Cracking sounds were being emitted by it nonstop.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong hurriedly retrieved the world spiritist treasures and moved away from the grand spirit formation.<br>Soon, that grand formation shattered completely. Then, four enormous figures flew out.<br>Those four figures were humanoid in appearance. However, they were not humans.<br>The reason for that was because they were ten meters tall. They looked like small giants. Furthermore, their bodies seemed to be made of crystals.<br>Not only were their bodies formed with crystals, their limbs and the armor they were wearing were also made of crystals.<br>That said, the four crystal humanoids emitted auras that Chu Feng and the others did not dare to disregard.<br>They were rank nine Martial Ancestors, the four crystal giants were all peak Martial Ancestors.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, they were peak Martial Ancestor level battle power. However, never did I expect them to have this sort of appearance,&rdquo; Upon seeing the four crystal giants, Chu Feng felt awe in his heart.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, a ray of light suddenly shot out from the foreheads of the four crystal giants.<br>A total of four rays of lights shot forth. Among them, one shot toward Wang Qiang&rsquo;s wrist, and the other toward Zhao Hong&rsquo;s wrist.<br>As for the final two rays of light, they shot toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s wrists.<br>&ldquo;O-ouch! T-this thing i-is a bit painful!!!&rdquo; Being struck by the light, Wang Qiang grimaced in pain.<br>&ldquo;Wang Qiang, don&rsquo;t move! They are recognizing their masters!&rdquo; Chu Feng shouted.<br>&ldquo;Ah?!!&rdquo; Hearing those words, Wang Qiang immediately opened his mouth wide in surprise. Then, he hurriedly grabbed the wrist that was struck by the light with his other hand. He deliberately grabbed it to stabilize it in order to prevent accidents from happening.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the crystal giant whose ray of light struck Wang Qiang&rsquo;s wrist turned into a vortex. Its body began to rapidly shrink. In the end, it turned into a ray of light and entered Wang Qiang&rsquo;s wrist.<br>At this moment, a special symbol appeared on Wang Qiang&rsquo;s wrist; it was imprinted on his skin.<br>That symbol looked like a crystal. However, it did not sparkle. On the contrary, it was very well-hidden. If one did not look for it carefully, one would simply not notice it.<br>The same sort of thing happened to Chu Feng and Zhao Hong. The crystal giants all turned into rays of lights and entered their wrists.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, with a thought from Zhao Hong, the crystal symbol on her wrist began to change. It turned into a ray of light, flew out from her wrist and stood beside her.<br>It was the crystal giant that had entered her wrist earlier.<br>Its cultivation and imposing aura were exactly the same as before. Merely, the sensation it gave off had changed.<br>Earlier, it had been masterless. However, it now possessed a master. As for its master, it was Zhao Hong.<br>It would listen to Zhao Hong&rsquo;s orders. Not only would it protect Zhao Hong, it would also immediately start to attack enemies for Zhao Hong should she order it to do so.<br>&ldquo;It has indeed recognized its master. However, why did two of them recognized Chu Feng as their master?&rdquo; Zhao Hong looked to Chu Feng with a slight expression of complaint on her face.<br>&ldquo;M-my b-brother&rsquo;s t-talent is exceptional,&rdquo; Wang Qiang said proudly.<br>&ldquo;It might also be random. Perhaps I was just lucky,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;I think that to be the case too,&rdquo; Although Zhao Hong said that, she revealed an envious gaze toward Chu Feng.<br>She actually knew that there must be a reason for two of the crystal giants to choose Chu Feng. Merely, she was slightly unwilling to accept that the crystal giants had chosen him instead of her.<br>That was why she had declared that it must be random so as to comfort herself.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another spirit formation inside that spirit formation that we can grasp,&rdquo; Chu Feng walked forward and looked to the unsealed grand formation.<br>Zhao Hong also walked forward. After a moment of observation, she smiled and said, &ldquo;That spirit formation is quite interesting. Unfortunately, it is only effective within a certain range. It doesn&rsquo;t have much significance.&rdquo;<br>Like Chu Feng, she had managed to discover the spirit formation left behind in the grand spirit formation.<br>It was a special slaughtering formation. As long as one grasped that spirit formation, one would be able to obtain extremely strong power within a certain range.<br>For example, Chu Feng was currently a rank five Half Martial Ancestor. If he were to grasp that spirit formation, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation will be able to increase within a limited range.<br>At the very most, Chu Feng would be able to increase his cultivation to that of a peak Martial Ancestor.<br>However, as it would be a cultivation obtained through the power of a spirit formation, it would have the same effect as the Immortal Transformation Pellets. Chu Feng would not be able to use his Heavenly Bloodline&rsquo;s power.<br>After increasing his cultivation with that spirit formation, Chu Feng would not be able to use his<br>Lightning<br>Armor and<br>Lightning<br>Wings, and would lose the heaven-defying battle power of his Heavenly Bloodline.<br>However, the strongest aspect regarding that spirit formation was not that it would be able to increase Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation. Instead, it was the fact that one could directly use that spirit formation to bring about a slaughter. After all, that spirit formation was an extremely powerful slaughtering formation.<br>Unfortunately, that spirit formation possessed a very limited range. With how enormous the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds, that spirit formation would naturally be of no use.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right in front of you anyways. If you can grasp it, why don&rsquo;t you grasp it? Chu Feng, take it,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen ordered.<br>&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; Chu Feng shouted. Then, he entered that spirit formation. He wanted to seize control of that formation.<br>&ldquo;This guy,&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng was determined to gain control over the spirit formation, Zhao Hong was somewhat annoyed. However, she did not speak to stop him.<br>&ldquo;W-wife, someone&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; Suddenly, Wang Qiang pointed to the distance.<br>&ldquo;Why have so many people suddenly appeared?&rdquo; Zhao Hong looked into the distance and started to frown.<br>The reason for that was because it didn&rsquo;t seem like people were passing by this place. Rather, it seemed like a lot of people were gathering in this place. Furthermore, their number was increasing.<br>Although they were all members of the younger generation, they all possessed extraordinary origin. Not to mention disciples from the tier two powers, there were even disciples from the tier one powers among them.<br>However, due to the fact that their concealment formation was still in place, no one noticed Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.<br>Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong listened to their conversations, and finally realized why they were all gathered here.<br>It turned out, the information Xiaoshi had mentioned was true.<br>There were two great geniuses gathered in the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds. One was the renowned Young Master Li Ming. As for the other one, he was the mysterious Hun Lian.<br>The two of them seemed to have already encountered one another. It seemed that they had agreed to battle one another to determine who was the actual number one genius.<br>As for this location, it was the location where the two of them would fight.<br>&ldquo;W-w-what a f-freaking c-coincidence! Of a-all places, they d-decided to choose this place,&rdquo; Wang Qiang declared.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this great? We&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy a show,&rdquo; At this moment, Chu Feng had already walked out from the spirit formation.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had returned completely unharmed, Wang Qiang asked in astonishment, &ldquo;Y-you&rsquo;ve succeeded?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mn. I have gained control of that spirit formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>As the spirit formation was already unsealed to begin with, it was not a difficult task for Chu Feng to gain control of the slaughtering formation with his attainments in world spirit techniques.<br>&ldquo;T-then, do you want t-to see this s-show?&rdquo; Wang Qiang asked.<br>&ldquo;Depends on what Zhao Hong wants to do,&rdquo;Chu Feng looked to Zhao Hong.<br>After all, only Zhao Hong possessed the map of the remnants. As such, they would have to rely on her to enter the remnants. Thus, Chu Feng would respect Zhao Hong&rsquo;s decision on whether they should leave or stay.<br>&ldquo;What Xiaoshi said is most likely true. Even if that old fart is in the remnants, he will not be able to obtain anything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rather than entering quickly to obtain nothing, it&rsquo;s better that we stay here and watch this show. I also want to see exactly what sorts of characters those Young Master Li Ming and Hun Lian are.&rdquo;<br>As Zhao Hong said those words, her lips were raised into a strange curve. A special sort of anticipating expression appeared in her eyes.<br><br></p></div>
