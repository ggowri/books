        <div> - Four Symbols Divine Power<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;In theory, it is possible. Merely, it is very difficult to accomplish.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Feng&rsquo;er, just think about it. Since Divine Powers are capable of separating themselves from their original masters&rsquo; bodies, by the same logic, they should&hellip; be able to be transferred to other people&rsquo;s bodies.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In fact, there are already many people capable of allowing a person to grasp multiple Divine Powers and increase their strength in that manner.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it appears that the body constitution of the Divine Bodies seems to be innately different from us who do not possess Divine Powers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, Divine Powers were capable of being transferred to other Divine Bodies. However, it is very difficult for them to be transferred to ordinary people.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I know of a person who is capable of accomplishing that. After you arrive in the Outer World, you can go and search for that person. If he is willing to help you, you will have the chance to become the true owner of the Four Symbols Divine Power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You will be able to become a super expert that possesses both a Divine Power and a Heavenly Lightning Bloodline,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Who is that person?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Ox-nosed Old Daoist,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Ox-nosed Old Daoist?&rdquo; Chu Feng remembered that name.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, that is his name. Merely, that fellow is very difficult to get along with. If you wish to have him help you, you&rsquo;ll have to put forth a great amount of effort.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, those are all things for the future. What you must do right now is persuade the Four Symbols Divine Power to obediently return to being Secret Skills,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Father, should I go and do that now?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan waved his hand. Then, Chu Feng felt his surroundings turn fuzzy. When his sight returned to normal, he had arrived at the location where the Four Great Divine Beasts were.<br>The Old Ape seemed to have realized something with Chu Feng&rsquo;s arrival. He stood up and went deep into the forbidden area.<br>At that moment, only Chu Feng and the Four Great Divine Beasts remained.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how was it? Did you meet your father?&rdquo; The Four Great Divine Beasts asked with great concern upon seeing Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I did. Seniors, I have something that I wish to speak with you all about,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; The Four Great Divine Beasts asked together. Their gazes turned serious. They all realized that something was amiss for Chu Feng to say that he had something to tell them the moment he returned.<br>&ldquo;If the four of you are to continue on like this, you might not be able to live for long,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Hearing those words, the Four Great Divine Beasts immediately grew silent. They seemed to all have thought of a lot of things after hearing only those words.<br>Naturally, what the Magma Emperor said was among the things running through their minds.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng saw extreme grief in the eyes of the Four Great Divine Beasts.<br>However, even with that being the case, the Four Great Divine Beasts looked to one another, then raised their heads. With smiles on their faces, they said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, if that is the case, we&rsquo;re afraid we will not be able to accompany you into the Outer World.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, even if the four of us are to accompany you, we would not be able to provide any assistance to you. We might even have to be looked after by you. This is actually a good thing. At least, we would no longer be your burden.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, the four of us truly hope that you can make great accomplishments in the Outer World, that you can show your clan that their decision to cast you here was an enormous mistake.&rdquo;<br>They were pretending to be happy, they were most definitely pretending to be happy. However, their blessings were from the bottoms of their hearts. They truly wished that Chu Feng would be able to accomplish great things.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, if you all are willing, you all will be able to accompany me into my Outer World campaign.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There is a method that can allow you all to continue to live. Merely&hellip; I&rsquo;m afraid that you all will have to return to being Secret Skills again,&rdquo; Chu Feng said truthfully.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, is what you said the truth? There is truly a way to allow us to continue to be Secret Skills?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the expressions of the Four Great Divine Beasts changed enormously. A trace of excitement appeared on their faces.<br>It could be seen that the four of them also wished to continue to live and not die like that.<br>Merely, they knew very well that they were no longer the same as they were before, that it was very difficult for them to return to becoming Secret Skills. Compared to before, it was many times more difficult now. In fact, it could even be said to be impossible to accomplish.<br>&ldquo;My father is capable of helping seniors return to being Secret Skills,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well, if it&rsquo;s possible, we&rsquo;ll have to trouble your father,&rdquo; The Four Great Divine Beasts nodded.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and inform my father right away,&rdquo; Chu Feng turned around and prepared to leave to find his father.<br>Suddenly, the White Tiger said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, wait a moment,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior White Tiger, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned around and asked.<br>&ldquo;After entering the Outer World, do not bother to find Qing Xuantian. Before, I did not believe it. However now, I am certain that he has truly discarded us for the sake of power,&rdquo; The White Tiger forced a bitter smile as it said those words.<br>Chu Feng noticed that the Azure Dragon, Vermillion Bird and Black Tortoise also had the same sort of expression.<br>&ldquo;I think that senior Qing Xuantian must have had his own difficulties,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, we know Qing Xuantian&rsquo;s character better than you. For some things, we have also thought about them before. Merely, we were unwilling to accept them, and did not wish to speak of them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, we now have no more illusions about them. From today on, we will wholeheartedly follow you. Although we will no longer be able to communicate with you like this, it is still a fortunate thing for us to be able to fight together with you,&rdquo; The Azure Dragon said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Being an abandoned Divine Power, it is our luck that we can continue to live. Moreover, we are lucky enough to accompany a master like you,&rdquo; The Vermilion Bird added.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, I&rsquo;ve heard from my father that there is someone in the Outer World that is capable of transferring Divine Powers to ordinary people.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In other words, after we reach the Outer World, there is a chance in having seniors return to being a Divine Power. If you all are willing, I hope to become your new master,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, is what you said the truth?&rdquo; The Four Great Divine Beasts revealed expressions of excitement.<br>&ldquo;Definitely,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Great, this is truly what we hoped for,&rdquo; The Four Great Divine Beasts said in unison. They revealed ecstatic expressions.<br>Seeing that the Four Great Divine Beasts were so excited to be able to serve him, Chu Feng felt joy from the bottom of his heart.<br>&ldquo;Great. In that case, I&rsquo;ll go and call my father to have him help seniors return to being Secret Skills,&rdquo; Chu Feng prepared to go and call for his father<br>&ldquo;Four sirs, thank you all for looking after Chu Feng these years,&rdquo; Right at that moment, Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s voice sounded. At that moment, the gazes of the Four Great Divine Beasts all changed. The reason for that was because Chu Xuanyuan was standing right beside Chu Feng.<br>Upon seeing Chu Xuanyuan, the Four Great Divine Beasts all revealed serious expressions. They were all able to tell that Chu Xuanyuan was so powerful that his strength was simply incapable of being estimated.<br>&ldquo;Those words are reversed. In terms of looking after, it is Chu Feng who is looking after us,&rdquo; Facing Chu Xuanyuan, the Four Great Divine Beasts acted very modestly.<br>&ldquo;You all can rest assured, it is most definitely the correct choice to choose Feng&rsquo;er as your master,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;We also think that to be the case,&rdquo; The Four Great Divine Beasts said in unison.<br>&ldquo;If you four are ready, we can begin now. The reason for that is because even I am uncertain how long you all can remain in your current forms,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to trouble you,&rdquo; The Four Great Divine Beasts said.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Then, Chu Xuanyuan began to move his arms, and many streams of boundless power began to appear. In an instant, they covered the entire region.<br>At that moment, the dazzling light caused Chu Feng some difficulty to keep his eyes open. Merely, the light persisted only for a moment before disappearing.<br>When Chu Feng opened his eyes again, he discovered that the Four Great Divine Beasts&rsquo; bodies were still present. However, they had died.<br>The reason for that was because their souls were no longer in their bodies. Instead, they were floating in the sky. They had once again returned to being Secret Skills.<br>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; The Four Great Divine Beasts said to Chu Xuanyuan.<br>&ldquo;If thanks must be said, it should be me who should thank you all. After all, after entering the Outer World, I will have to trouble you four with looking after Feng&rsquo;er,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said with a light smile.<br>&ldquo;Please rest assured. We will definitely give our all to protect Chu Feng,&rdquo; After the Four Great Divine Beasts said those words to Chu Xuanyuan, they all started to fly toward and enter Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was able to sense that the four Secret Skills that he had lost had once again returned to his body; Chu Feng had once again grasped the power of the Four Great Supreme Secret Skills.<br>Merely, Chu Feng was unable to calm his heart. He knew that his father was very powerful. However, he had never expected for his father to be this powerful. In merely an instant, he had turned the four Great Divine Beasts back into Secret Skills.<br>&ldquo;Father, thank you for helping me with this,&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly said to Chu Xuanyuan. He was not saying those words out of courtesy. Rather, he felt gratefulness from the bottom of his heart,<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thanking me already? In that case, are you going to thank me for this too?&rdquo; As Chu Xuanyuan spoke, he flipped his palm, and a strange substance that appeared to be made of light floated out of his hand,<br>&ldquo;This is?&rdquo; Seeing that substance, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes shone. Even though he did not know exactly what that substance was, Chu Feng was able to tell that it was a very powerful spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;This is a spirit formation capable of resurrecting the people of the Chu Family,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br><br></p></div>
