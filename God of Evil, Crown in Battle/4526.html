        <h1>Chapter 4525</h1>
        <div>: You&rsquo;re the Trash<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Xia Yun&rsquo;er, together with a group of experts from the Starfall Holy Land, were trying to open the remnant.<br>Even though they had the key to open the remnant, due to their limited proficiency in world spiritist techniques, they still needed to put quite a bit of effort in order to open the remnant.<br>Chu Feng initially wanted to make an appearance, but when he gave it a second thought, he felt that there might be a deeper reason behind their appearance here. It might not be good for him to make an appearance right away.<br>In any case, Chu Feng just wanted to lend them a helping hand, so it mattered not whether he helped them openly or from the shadows.<br>And his decision was to help them from the shadows.<br>Back then, Chu Feng and Xia Yun&rsquo;er were both juniors who were almost equal in strength. The Starfall Eight Immortals were experts whom he could only look up to, and the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master was even more of a figure whom Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t dream of meeting.<br>But now, even if the entire Starfall Holy Land were to pit its forces against Chu Feng, Chu Feng would still be able to decimate them with a single thought.<br>This was the vast difference in cultivation levels between them.<br>While Chu Feng did have some conflicts with them initially, they managed to settle them eventually and become friends with one another. It was for this reason that Chu Feng wanted to help them from the shadows.<br>As soon as Chu Feng began putting a hand into it, the remnant which the crowd was still struggling with a moment ago suddenly started opening smoothly.<br>Those from the Starfall Holy Land could sense that they were about to succeed, that the remnant was going to be opened very soon, and great joy broke out on their faces.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, focus! Channel your full strength and aim to open this remnant in a single push!&rdquo;<br>Under the order of the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master, the crowd gritted their teeth tightly together and channeled every last bit of spirit power they had into the entrance of the remnant.<br>And to their delight, their efforts paid off, and the remnant successfully opened!<br>But what they didn&rsquo;t know was that the reason why everything went so well had nothing much to do with them. Rather, it was due to the little push that Chu Feng was giving them from the back.<br>After the entrance to the remnant opened, the phenomenon in the sky suddenly grew even larger.<br>It was initially still concealed, such that only those with exceptional perception abilities like Chu Feng were able to detect it. However, with a pillar of light rising to heaven, even ordinary mortals would immediately notice it afar, let alone cultivators.<br>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; Chu Feng wondered.<br>The phenomenon had attracted a group of people whom Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t recognize, but based on the uniforms they were wearing, it was apparent that they weren&rsquo;t from the Ancestral Martial Dragon City.<br>It was already incomprehensible to Chu Feng why the Starfall Holy Land would dare to come to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City in the first place, and seeing the presence of other powers only served to further baffle him. Did the Ancestral Martial Dragon City invite them over, or did something happen to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City?<br>In any case, the group of people who were approaching the remnant didn&rsquo;t seem to have kind intentions in mind.<br>As such, Chu Feng chose not to reveal himself right away. He wanted to see what that group of people was up to, and whether they intended to snatch the treasures of the remnant away or not.<br>It would be one thing if they had come in peace, but if they really intended to lay their hands on the Starfall Holy Land, that would be something that Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t stand for.<br>Putting aside the fact that the entire Ancestral Dragon Starfield was now under the rule of the Chu Heavenly Clan, just the fact that the Starfall Holy Land was a power native to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was more than enough reason for Chu Feng to back them up.<br>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!<br>As expected, that group of people were indeed headed for this remnant.<br>Before those from the Starfall Holy Land could step into the remnant, that group of people had already swooped right in and landed right before the entrance of the remnant. Without any hesitation, they began to make their way into the remnant.<br>Weng!<br>But before they could do so, a powerful oppressive might had already sealed off the entrance to the remnant, blocking their path.<br>It was from the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master.<br>&ldquo;How dare you stop me? Do you know who I am?&rdquo;<br>One of the women within the group turned to look at the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master coldly. There was a lofty look in her eyes, which showed that she had utterly no regard for the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master at all.<br>&ldquo;Like we would care who you are. We&rsquo;re the ones who opened this remnant, so who do you think you are to try to enter it?&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er bellowed furiously.<br>&ldquo;Hah! A mere ant like you dares to ask us we think we are? You should be honored that we&rsquo;re willing to step into the remnant you opened!&rdquo; the woman said as she took out a token.<br>Written on the token were the four words &lsquo;Flying Feather Heavenly Sect&rsquo;.<br>And as soon as they saw those four words, the faces of the crowd from the Starfall Holy Land immediately turned anxious.<br>&ldquo;Our apologies. We didn&rsquo;t know that you were from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect. We beg your pardon if we have offended you in any way.&rdquo;<br>Even the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master quickly retracted his oppressive might and bowed humbly to the group of people.<br>Seeing this situation, gleeful smiles broke out on the faces of the group of people.<br>&ldquo;Looks like you still know your place despite being a mere ant!&rdquo; the woman said smugly to the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Master.<br>The complexion of those from the Starfall Holy Land didn&rsquo;t look too good after hearing those words. How could they possibly be unfazed when their respected Lord Holy Master had been described as a &lsquo;mere ant&rsquo;?<br>But those from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect had little regard for what those from the Starfall Holy Land were thinking. After saying their piece, they turned their heads around and prepared themselves to step into the remnant.<br>&ldquo;Hold it right there.&rdquo;<br>It was then that Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s voice suddenly sounded.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who you are, but it&rsquo;s common courtesy not to intrude on a remnant that another power has opened. This is the rule set by the City Master Long. You&rsquo;re going against City Master Long&rsquo;s will here,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said loudly.<br>&ldquo;Try repeating that again.&rdquo;<br>The woman turned her head around and looked at Xia Yun&rsquo;er with a hostile look in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Yun&rsquo;er, stop talking!&rdquo;<br>The indignant Xia Yun&rsquo;er was unwilling to let things rest like that, but the other experts of the Starfall Holy Land immediately covered Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s mouth to stop her from saying anything else.<br>One of them even turned to the woman and explained with a subservient smile, &ldquo;My apologies. She doesn&rsquo;t know the rules, so please don&rsquo;t hold it against her.&rdquo;<br>However, the humble attitude from the Starfall Holy Land wasn&rsquo;t enough to earn the understanding of the woman. The woman stared at the crowd from the Starfall Holy Land fro a moment before muttering, &ldquo;A bunch of trash.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your group looks more like the trash to me.&rdquo;<br>Yet, who could have thought that another voice suddenly sounded amidst the Starfall Holy Land at this moment.<br>As soon as those words sounded, the crowd from the Starfall Holy Land felt their hearts cramping up as they realized that they were in deep trouble.<br>What Xia Yun&rsquo;er did earlier was just to talk back to them, but this was obviously courting death!<br></p></div>
