        <h1>Chapter 4860</h1>
        <div>: Impact<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The face of Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother turned pale upon catching a closer look at the person Chu Feng had just hurled out of his gourd.<br>It was Shengguang Yunyue!<br>Despite her usual dignified and graceful demeanor, she was even more feared than Shengguang Haifu. There were even some who gave her the nickname, &lsquo;Vicious Hag of the Holy Light&rsquo;.<br>And she did live up to that nickname.<br>How did that feared demon end up in such a state?<br>What was even more incomprehensible were the words that Shengguang Yunyue uttered right after being cast out. Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother wondered if she was hearing things.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ve already told you everything! Please don&rsquo;t torture me anymore, please! Just grant me a quick death!&rdquo;<br>Those were the words that came out of Shengguang Yunyue&rsquo;s mouth in a tearful voice.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what did you do to Lord Yunyue?!&rdquo;<br>A furious roar sounded. It was from Shengguang Haifu.<br>Despite being a grand elder himself, the fact that he addressed Shengguang Yunyue as &lsquo;Lord Yunyue&rsquo; showed that he viewed her in high regard. He was so angered that he pointed a trembling finger at Chu Feng as killing intent poured out of him, filling the entire palace.<br>It looked like he wouldn&rsquo;t let Chu Feng go if the latter didn&rsquo;t give him a satisfactory explanation.<br>Shengguang Yunyue also finally snapped out of her state upon hearing those words. She realized that she was in the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s base.<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Haifu, run! Call Lord Clan Chief here!&rdquo; Shengguang Yunyue mustered all of her strength to shout.<br>Yet, her shout only made Shengguang Haifu freeze in place.<br>Run?<br>She was telling a rank four Martial Exalted level expert like him to run from a junior?<br>Had anyone said those words to him, he would have surely sent a tight slap on his face. How could someone like him possibly need to run away from a mere junior?<br>But the one saying those words to him right now was Shengguang Yunyue, forcing him to think deeper into it.<br>Could it be that Chu Feng isn&rsquo;t alone? Did he bring helpers with him? Or did something else happen here? Why would Lord Yunyue tell me to run?<br>Tzlala~<br>While Shengguang Yunyue was deep in thought, brilliant lightning started appearing in the palace. When he took a closer look, he finally realized the rationale behind Shengguang Yunyue&rsquo;s words.<br>The brilliant lightning was coming from Chu Feng. He had summoned the Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and his Divine Power.<br>These were evidence of Chu Feng&rsquo;s overwhelming talent. It was his ability to use both his Heavenly Bloodline and Divine Power simultaneously that he was viewed as a threat by the Holy Light Clan.<br>Shengguang Haifu&rsquo;s face finally started warping in shock. It was not because of the great talent Chu Feng had displayed but his current cultivation level.<br>Based on what he knew, Chu Feng should be at rank six Utmost Exalted level. No matter how talented he was, the most he could do was to make a breakthrough to rank seven Utmost Exalted level in this limited period of time.<br>Yet, he actually managed to push his cultivation all the way up to rank five Martial Exalted level, a rank higher than him.<br>Even if his Lightning Mark, Lightning Armor, and Divine Power had raised his cultivation by a rank each, that was still only an enhancement of three ranks! Didn&rsquo;t this mean that his base cultivation level had already reached rank two Martial Exalted level?<br>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t Chu Feng. Who are you?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Haifu didn&rsquo;t sound as confident as before. He was starting to think that the person before him wasn&rsquo;t Chu Feng but someone else disguised as him.<br>&ldquo;Who else am I if not Chu Feng? Your father?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.<br>He walked up to Shengguang Haifu, grabbed him by the hair, and dragged him over to Shengguang Yunyue&rsquo;s side.<br>&ldquo;Take a good look at her. You better tell me what I want to know if you don&rsquo;t want to land in the same plight as her! Speak, how is this cultivation formation activated?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;No matter who you are, there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;ll betray my own clan!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Haifu refused to admit that the person before him was Chu Feng, and he spoke with a determined attitude.<br>&ldquo;Trying to play the tough man with me, huh? Interesting. Since that&rsquo;s the case, allow me to rephrase my question.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s lips curled into a mocking smile as he took out a black vat from his Cosmos Sack.<br>&ldquo;Of the two of you, the one who tells me the way to activate this cultivation formation first will get to live. I&rsquo;ll let the other one enjoy this vat,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing the black vat, Shengguang Haifu burst into frenzied laughter.<br>&ldquo;Brat, I don&rsquo;t know who you are, but I&rsquo;ll concede defeat here today. However, you shouldn&rsquo;t even dream of squeezing out even a single secret regarding the Holy Light Clan from me!&rdquo;<br>He turned to Shengguang Yunyue right after and continued.<br>&ldquo;As for Lord Yunyue, she&rsquo;s even more fiercely loyal to the Holy Light Clan. It&rsquo;s impossible for you to force anything about the Holy Light Clan from her tightly guarded lips!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Haifu had already made up his mind to face the torture. His conviction emboldened him, granting him the courage to speak to Chu Feng arrogantly.<br>But more than he was confident in himself, he was more confident in Shengguang Yunyue. His gleeful attitude showed just how certain he was that Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t get even a squeak out of the two of them.<br>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;ll speak! Don&rsquo;t torture me, I&rsquo;ll speak. Young hero Chu Feng, I admit my fault for what I did earlier. I was foolish to even think of going against you. I deserve death!<br>&ldquo;G-give me another chance! You want to know the way to activate this cultivation formation! I&rsquo;ll give it to you! Just don&rsquo;t torture me&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Yet, who could have thought that Shengguang Yunyue would betray his expectations right after? Her tone was subservient, and her attitude showed her deep fear toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Lord Yunyue, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Haifu widened his eyes in shock, unable to believe what he was seeing.<br>The person in front of him was definitely Shengguang Yunyue, but her behavior was completely different from the Shengguang Yunyue he knew of.<br>How did the loyal and domineering Shengguang Yunyue turn so weak and cowardly?<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play tricks on me. I&rsquo;m not that patient as to entertain you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng glared at Shengguang Yunyue warningly. His gaze made Shengguang Yunyue sweat profusely.<br>&ldquo;I-I know. I won&rsquo;t trick you. I&rsquo;ll tell you the way to activate the formation.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Yunyue ignored Shengguang Haifu&rsquo;s shocked gaze and began explaining the details surrounding the cultivation formation to Chu Feng.<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother was completely dumbfounded by Shengguang Yunyue&rsquo;s behavior. It was simply too inconceivable.<br>She could tell that the man before her was indeed Chu Feng, but that was precisely what made this entire situation even more bewildering.<br>She could clearly feel the aura of a rank five Martial Exalted level cultivator gushing through her body in waves. That was a level that she could never hope to reach in her lifetime, but here it was, coming out from Chu Feng.<br>She had known about Chu Feng&rsquo;s immense talent beforehand, but this was still too unbelievable.<br></p></div>
