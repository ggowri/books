        <div> - Tailing In Secret<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>This Nangong Imperial Clansman simply did not know about the relationship between the Asura Evil Spirit and Chu Feng at all. To them, the Asura Evil Spirit was an Asura Evil Spirit, whereas Chu Feng was Chu Feng.<br>The appearance of the Asura Evil Spirit was a mystery that only the upper echelons of the Nangong Imperial Clan knew the truth about. However, Chu Feng was someone who everyone in the Nangong Imperial Clan knew about.<br>The Nangong Imperial Clan had given the same reason to both the outsiders and their own clansmen about why they wanted to capture Chu Feng.<br>They stated that they had treated Chu Feng extremely well. Yet, Chu Feng had used despicable methods to swindle their Nangong Imperial Clan&rsquo;s secret skill, the Water Immortal Profound Technique.<br>That was the reason why the Nangong Imperial Clan wanted to capture Chu Feng dead or alive. If someone was able to kill Chu Feng for the Nangong Imperial Clan, they would not look into the Water Immortal Profound Technique, and would instead present it to the person who killed Chu Feng. Furthermore, they would also bestow rewards upon the person who killed Chu Feng.<br>This was not the important matter. Most importantly, after this event, Nangong Lian, Nangong Ya and Nangong Baihe, who possessed good relationships with Chu Feng, were all imprisoned by the Nangong Imperial Clan. Furthermore, whether they were alive or dead was unknown.<br>In the end, they were still implicated by Chu Feng.<br>This caused Chu Feng to feel extremely guilty. He worried deeply about their safety.<br>However, the current Chu Feng was powerless to do anything.<br>In the end, Chu Feng decided that he could not just leave like this. He must brave danger and return to the Nangong Imperial Clan and think of a way to save Aunt Lian and the others.<br>As for this man by the name of Nangong Dahao, Chu Feng did not kill him. Instead, Chu Feng used a Taboo Formation Technique to erase his memory and make him forget about being captured by him.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng had concealed his aura and quietly proceed toward the direction of the Nangong Imperial Clan. Chu Feng had already entered the Nangong Imperial Clan&rsquo;s territory.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s them?&rdquo; To Chu Feng&rsquo;s surprise, even though he was taking a remote path, he actually ran into three familiar people. The appearance of these three people caused both shock and joy in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart.<br>They were actually&hellip; the Nangong Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Second Prince, Nangong Tianhu, and the Nangong Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Third Prince, Nangong Tianshi.<br>If it were only the two of them, Chu Feng would not be this happy. Most importantly, between the two of them was another person.<br>This person was wearing a cloak that concealed her appearance. However, Chu Feng was still able to tell with a single glance that this person was Nangong Baihe&rsquo;s younger sister, Nangong Moli.<br>&ldquo;Why did the two of them bring Moli out here?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt that this was fishy. Thus, he began to secretly tail them. He wished to find out the actual intentions of Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi.<br>After he tailed them for some time, Chu Feng became extremely angered. It turned out that Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi were trying to capture Chu Feng. The reason why they had brought Nangong Moli with them was because they wanted to use Nangong Moli as a bargaining chip to force Chu Feng out.<br>&ldquo;Second brother, will bringing this girl really make Chu Feng reveal himself?&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Is that Chu Feng really that loyal of a person? Would he really reveal himself for the sake of this girl?&rdquo; Nangong Tianshi looked to Nangong Moli with a gaze of doubt.<br>&ldquo;It is this girl who said that Chu Feng is a loyal person. If Chu Feng refuses to reveal himself, it will also let this girl know exactly what sort of person Chu Feng is, and will instead let her stop having delusions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, the situation in the clan is very chaotic. Thus, there is no one to bother with us. Even if we cannot capture Chu Feng, we will still be able to enjoy ourselves. Isn&rsquo;t this wonderful?&rdquo; Nangong Tianhu said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Humph. I&rsquo;d suggest that the two of you release me right now. Else, if we are to truly run into big brother Chu Feng, the two of you will end up suffering a great calamity,&rdquo; At this moment, Nangong Moli&rsquo;s hands were bound by special chains. However, she was not afraid. Instead, she pouted and warned the two princes.<br>&ldquo;Little girl, you are thinking too highly of that Chu Feng, no? Even if he had managed to break through and became a rank one Half Martial Emperor, did you really think that he could contend against the two of us? What could he possibly do?&rdquo; Nangong Tianshi sneered.<br>&ldquo;Can cultivation really illustrate everything? Big brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength surpasses your imagination. Have you forgotten the day when you broke through, where the golden dragon that you triggered was frightened away by big brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s divine lightning? Have you forgotten how it did not dare to stay in the sky anymore?&rdquo; Nangong Moli mocked while pouting her mouth.<br>&ldquo;Little girl, you&rsquo;re looking for a beating,&rdquo; Nangong Tianshi was extremely enraged. Then, a &lsquo;pow&rsquo; was heard. He had slapped Nangong Moli.<br>Nangong Tianshi possessed the cultivation of a rank four Half Martial Emperor. How could Nangong Moli possibly withstand a slap from him? The slap directly knocked Nangong Moli to the ground. The power behind his slap was so strong that it had actually created a crater in the ground.<br>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; Nangong Moli crawled back up from the crater stubbornly. She did not yield to him and did not curse him. Instead, she only snorted coldly.<br>However, at this moment, her little face was extremely swollen. Not only that, there was also a large bloody handprint on her swollen cheek. Many streams of scarlet blood were rolling down Nangong Moli&rsquo;s cheek.<br>&ldquo;Animal!&rdquo; Seeing this scene, Chu Feng was so enraged that his veins popped out. However, he could not attack them yet. After all, they were still in the Nangong Imperial Clan&rsquo;s territory. If he were to attack them now, he would only be exposing himself. Thus, regardless of how enraged he was, Chu Feng still had to endure it.<br>&ldquo;Third brother, this isn&rsquo;t too good, no? After all, Moli is still only a child,&rdquo; Nangong Tianhu urged against it.<br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s only a small child without a mother. When Nangong Lian was here, no one wanted to deal with her. It was all because Nangong Lian was very troublesome. It&rsquo;s not because they feared her or her father.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, that Nangong Lian has been imprisoned by Imperial Father. There&rsquo;s no one to protect her now. Yet, she actually still dares to talk back to us. If I do not teach her a lesson now, how could she possibly put us in her eyes in the future?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Moreover, no matter what, we are still her older brothers. It is natural for us to teach her about how to conduct herself,&rdquo; Nangong Tianshi said righteously.<br>&ldquo;Sigh, third brother, you&rsquo;ve misunderstood me. What I meant is that even if you are to hit her, you must still treat her injuries afterward. Else, if others see it, they will think that we are bullying the young. It will not be good.&rdquo;<br>As Nangong Tianhu spoke, he used world spirit techniques and began to heal Nangong Moli&rsquo;s injured cheek. Even though he was not very proficient with world spirit techniques, it was still very effortless for him to heal such a small injury. In the blink of an eye, Nangong Moli&rsquo;s little face returned to normal, it was as if she was never injured before.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still second brother who is wise. Haha,&rdquo; Nangong Tianshi burst into loud laughter.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to be expected,&rdquo; Nangong Tianhu was immensely proud of himself. Afterward, the two of them continued to laugh as they proceeded forward with Nangong Moli.<br>All of this was seen by Chu Feng. Chu Feng had already disliked Nangong Tianhu and Nangong Tianshi before.<br>And now, it could be said that Chu Feng deeply hated them.<br>Not only were the two of them narrow-minded, they were also despicable and shameless. No matter what, Nangong Moli was a person of the Nangong Imperial Clan. Even if she was not their blood younger sister born from the same father and mother, she was still their younger sister who possessed the same bloodline as them. Furthermore, she was still only a child.<br>Yet, the two of them were actually able to do such a thing to her. It was sufficient to reveal to Chu Feng that the two of them were people devoid of conscience.<br>For people like them, it would be fine if they did not take on the position of the next Clan Chief. However, if either of them were to become the next Clan Chief, it would be disastrous for the Nangong Imperial Clan.<br>Chu Feng had already made the resolution that he would properly teach the two of them a lesson.<br></p></div>
