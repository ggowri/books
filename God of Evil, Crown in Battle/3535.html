        <div> - Sacred Full Bloom<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After journeying for some time, the vast group of people composed of various powers finally arrived before the Void Sacred Tree.<br>Not only had the spirit formation around the Void Sacred Tree completely disappeared, but the Void Sacred Tree itself was also flickering with a peculiar light.<br>The light was light golden. It covered the entire Void Sacred Tree, giving off an incomparably holy sensation.<br>Furthermore, countless flowers had appeared on the Void Sacred Tree. Those flowers were all light pink. They resembled peonies, and were very beautiful.<br>Those flowers caused this holy Sacred Tree to appear somewhat mundane.<br>&ldquo;Never would I imagine it to be the legendary Sacred Full Bloom.&rdquo;<br>After seeing the transformation of the Void Sacred Tree, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief revealed a complicated look.<br>It was not only him. Many people of the Chu Heavenly Clan and the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm also revealed serious expressions with shock in their eyes.<br>&ldquo;Senior Clan Chief Chu, what do you mean by Sacred Full Bloom?&rdquo; Kong Tianhui asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;The spirit formation surrounding the Void Sacred Tree opens once every hundred years. When it is open, there are rules that one must follow in order to train inside it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, legend has it that the Void Sacred Tree will break its rules on its own. At that time, not only will its spirit formation disappear, but the Void Sacred Tree will also bloom with flowers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is the Sacred Full Bloom. Merely, even though our clan has been in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm for all these years, never have we witnessed a Sacred Full Bloom. Originally, we had thought that it was merely a rumor that could not be trusted. Never did we expect that this legendary sight would really appear,&rdquo; said the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Chu, in this case, does it mean that this Sacred Full Bloom indicates that if one is to enter the Void Sacred Tree while it's happening, one will be able to gain even greater benefits?&rdquo; someone asked.<br>&ldquo;During the Sacred Full Bloom, the natural energies within the Void Sacred Tree will indeed become even more ample. That being said, the way to train inside the Void Sacred Tree is actually mainly by relying on a special sort of green fruit within the Void Sacred Tree. After eating that fruit, one could convert it to natural energies. It will also allow one&rsquo;s mind to become clearer, and make it easier to gain martial comprehension.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We named the fruit the Sacred Tree Fruit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;According to legend, during the Sacred Full Bloom, there will be many times more such fruits appearing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, it is said that&hellip; there is also another type of fruit during the Sacred Full Bloom, a golden fruit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, this golden fruit is not something that one could use to train with.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What is it used for then?&rdquo; Kong Tianhui rushed to ask.<br>The others present also uniformly stared at the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. They had all realized that the golden fruit was most definitely much more amazing than the green Sacred Tree Fruit. They all wanted to know exactly what the use of the golden fruit was.<br>&ldquo;It's said that there is a Sacred Palace Hall inside the Void Sacred Tree. Contained inside the Sacred Palace hall is an enormous secret. As for the golden fruit, it's the key to enter the Sacred Palace Hall,&rdquo; said the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Oh? In that case, it would mean that we&rsquo;ve truly come at the right time.&rdquo;<br>After hearing what the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said, the experts of the various powers present all became extremely excited. They all felt that they&rsquo;d encountered a rare opportunity.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief,&rdquo; right at that moment, an elder arrived beside the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and whispered something to him.<br>No one knew what he said. However, after hearing what he had said, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief immediately frowned.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others asked in unison. The crowd all looked to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief with curiosity.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did not attempt to conceal the information he had just received. Directly, he said to the crowd, &ldquo;A group of people have entered the Void Sacred Tree before us. This group of people are not people from our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Furthermore, they are very strong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, they seemed to already know that the Void Sacred Tree will be undergoing a Sacred Full Bloom.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh? Could it be that there are people that know the Void Sacred Tree better than your Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; The crowd asked in succession.<br>&ldquo;We will likely only find out the concrete details after we find those people,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Who cares who they are? Today, we have all these experts gathered here; regardless of who they might be, we do not fear them. Clan Chief Chu, let us go in and investigate, and prevent those people from seizing the decisive opportunity. If the golden fruit is seized by them, your Chu Heavenly Clan would suffer major losses.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It's better that we go in immediately.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd all began to persuade the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to enter the Void Sacred Tree. They were all itching to enter, especially after they learned the news that others had already entered before them.<br>However, they needed to give the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief face. Thus, they found it unbefitting to enter without his permission.<br>&ldquo;Everyone here are our clan&rsquo;s honored guests. As for the Void Sacred Tree, it's open to the public to begin with. If anyone is to obtain any treasure inside, you may all keep them,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>Hearing those words, the crowd nodded, and revealed joyous looks. Those were precisely the words they were waiting for. With that, they would be able to plunder the treasures within the Void Sacred Tree completely in an unrestrained manner.<br>&ldquo;That said, since everyone here is a guest of our Chu Heavenly Clan, I hope that no one will harm our friendly relationships for the sake of treasures,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief added.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, you can rest assured. We wouldn&rsquo;t possibly fight each other for the sake of treasures,&rdquo; many people voiced their guarantee.<br>&ldquo;Finally, the Sacred Full Bloom is something that has only been heard of in legends. Never has our clan ever experienced it. Thus, we do not understand the Sacred Full Bloom, and do not know if there might be dangers inside.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, everyone, please be careful after entering the Void Sacred Tree,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief warned the crowd.<br></p></div>
