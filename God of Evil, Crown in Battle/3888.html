        <div> - Cruel Torture<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It would appear that you all want to suffer.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll satisfy you.&rdquo; Tuoba Chengan&rsquo;s gaze turned cold. He then looked to the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted came to a tacit understanding with Tuoba Chengan. He gently waved the horsetail whisk he held in his hand and pointed it at the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>A total of eleven blood-red blades shot down from the sky and pierced into the eleven Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; bodies.<br>&ldquo;Eeahhhh~~~&rdquo;<br>Once the blades entered their bodies, the Mystic Cave Saints began to scream miserably.<br>The bystanders might not understand why the Mystic Cave Saints were screaming so miserably, but the Mystic Cave Saints themselves knew very well.<br>Once those blood-red blades entered their bodies, they began to move about within their bodies like insects.<br>The blades pierced through their bones, their five viscera, the heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys, their six bowel organs, the stomach, large and small intestines, triple heater, and bladder, sliced apart their meridians, and most importantly&hellip; caused injuries to their souls.<br>Furthermore, the blood-red blades seemed to be poisoned. The pain brought forth by the blades was simply intolerable. Even the Mystic Cave Saints felt as if they would rather die than suffer such pain.<br>Even the bystanders were filled with fear after seeing how miserable the Mystic Cave Saints were.<br>Although they did not know exactly what sort of pain the Mystic Cave Saints were undergoing, they were able to imagine how painful of a torture they were subjected to just by hearing their screams and witnessing the way they struggled with the pain.<br>&ldquo;Are you all still unwilling to take out the treasures?&rdquo; asked the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Enough&hellip; enough of your bull&hellip; bullshit! If you&rsquo;re capable, try killing us!&rdquo; the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints shouted loudly as he endured the excruciating pain with gritted teeth.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in such a rush, this is merely the beginning,&rdquo; the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted laughed strangely. Then, he waved his horsetail whisk again.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next instant, several dozen blood-red blades shot down from the sky and pierced into the bodies of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>This time around, those blood-red blades not only pierced into their bodies, but they penetrated them completely and came out from the other side. After coming out from their bodies, they once again pierced into them.<br>The bystanders were all able to clearly witness the crimson blades exiting and entering the bodies of the Mystic Cave Saints in succession.<br>As the blades pierced in and out nonstop, even the gowns that the Mystic Cave Saints used to hide their appearances with were being destroyed.<br>Soon, the true appearances of the Mystic Cave Saints was exposed to the crowd.<br>The crowd were all shocked to see the current appearances of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>The reason for that was because even though the exposed Mystic Cave Saints were covered in cuts and wounds, the blood-red blades had not cause any harm to their heads, and had not ruined their faces.<br>Thus, their facial appearances remained intact.<br>It was precisely because their facial appearances were intact that the crowd were so shocked.<br>The reason for that was because the appearances of the Mystic Cave Saints did not resemble humans at all.<br>Their skin was dark green, and their eyes dark red. They had ox-like noses and pig-like ears. Even their mouths were particularly large. Furthermore, when they opened their mouths as they screamed in pain, the crowd could see that their teeth were sharp fangs.<br>Their appearances simply did not resemble sacred and aloof Saint-cloak World Spiritists.<br>Instead, they seemed more like monstrous beasts, or even monsters period.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. Truly never would I have expected that the Mystic Cave Saints are not humans, but instead a bunch of monsters.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder you all tried to cover yourselves all the time, afraid to reveal your true appearances,&rdquo; mocked Tuoba Chengan.<br>The others from the All-heaven Sect also laughed boisterously.<br>They all began to openly ridicule and mock the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Even if we're monsters, we still understand what it means to be righteous and loyal. But what about you all? You&rsquo;re inferior to even monsters!&rdquo; the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints refuted as he endured his pain.<br>&ldquo;What a joke! A bunch of monsters actually want to talk about righteousness and loyalty?&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Tuoba Chengan looked to the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, &ldquo;Heavenly Exalted, are we truly unable to find where the stolen treasures are hidden if they refuse to hand them over themselves?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course we can find the treasures," as he said those words, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted looked to the Mystic Cave Saints. &ldquo;If you all are to hand over the treasures on your own, this Exalted will spare your lives. If this Exalted needs to retrieve those treasures himself, you won&rsquo;t be able to keep your lives.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Enough of your rubbish. Ever since we&rsquo;ve fallen into your hands, we brothers knew that we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get out alive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Kill or torture, do as you wish.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the treasures that we brothers possess, humph, Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, it&rsquo;s not that we look down on you, but if we brothers refuse to take out those treasures, even if you are to crush us to dust, you will still be unable to find them,&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Yoh, you&rsquo;re quite confident. Since that&rsquo;s the case, this Exalted must make you all understand whether it's your ability to conceal your treasures that&rsquo;s stronger, or this Exalted&rsquo;s ability to find treasures that&rsquo;s stronger.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted waved his horsetail whisk again.<br>Like a torrential rain, the blood-red blades that filled the sky once again shot down towards the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Eeaahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next instant, only a single sound could be heard -- the miserable screams of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt extremely pained to see this scene.<br>It was as if those blood-red blades were also piercing his body at the same time as they were piercing the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>The pain of being cut apart by blades filed Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart.<br>&ldquo;Faster! Go faster!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng shouted anxiously.<br>Ever since Chu Feng began his fusion with the inheritance, he had not only been able to observe everything inside the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb, he had also discovered that he was able to gain control of an enormous power.<br>That was the power of the spirit formation inside the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb. That power was also a part of the inheritance.<br>Although that power could only be used in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb and its vicinity, it was totally capable of rescuing the Mystic Cave Saints and defeating the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>However, if Chu Feng was to fuse with the inheritance and seek to obtain its acknowledgement normally, obtaining the power of the spirit formation would be extremely slow. Thus, after Chu Feng discovered that the Mystic Cave Saints were in danger, he had shifted his attention to the fusion.<br>Chu Feng began to fully focus on fusing with the power of the spirit formation, and disregarded those inheritances.<br>Unfortunately, even for that, time was needed.<br>That was the reason why Chu Feng was so anxious.<br>After all, he did not wish to look on helplessly as the Mystic Cave Saints died before his eyes.<br>However, without sufficient certainty, Chu Feng would only be throwing his life away by going out.<br>He must continue to fuse with the power of the spirit formation. Only after he felt that he possessed sufficient power to be able to defeat the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted could he go out and rescue the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, if you are to do this, you will be giving up on those inheritances.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if you are able to rescue your friends, you&rsquo;ll lose the qualifications to obtain those inheritances.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even the power of the spirit formation that you will obtain will only last for a short period of time.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears. It was the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s soul remnant.<br>His tone was one of dissuasion and advice.<br>The Great Monster Slayer Emperor did not wish for Chu Feng to abandon the inheritances for the sake of saving the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this junior knows what sort of consequences my actions will bring. However&hellip; this junior cannot watch with folded arms as they are tortured to death. Because of that, this junior will have to let down senior&rsquo;s kind intentions.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng closed his eyes. Disregarding everything else, he began to focus all of his efforts on fusing with the power of the spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, it&rsquo;ll be truly unfortunate.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had made his decision, the Great Monster Slayer Emperor sighed and shook his head with regret.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>The miserable screams were still resonating.<br>Merely, compared to before, those screams had become extremely weak.<br>The elven Mystic Cave Saints were lying on the ground like eleven piles of mutilated meat.<br>They no longer had any power to struggle. Their bodies were twitching uncontrollably. Even their voices had become completely powerless.<br>They seemed like they were on the verge of death.<br>However, even with that being the case, the countless blood-red blades were still revolving around them, and piercing in and out of their bodies repeatedly like a torrential rain.<br>This scene was truly cruel.<br>&ldquo;Bloodmiset Heavenly Exalted, are you still unable to find the treasures?&rdquo; asked Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, this Exalted will definitely find them,&rdquo; said the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted. He was still filled with confidence.<br></p></div>
