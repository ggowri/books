        <h1>Chapter 3843</h1>
        <div> - Evenly Matched?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior, please rest assured, this junior will definitely return victorious.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng soared into the sky and descended onto the center of the plaza after saying those words.<br>&ldquo;Eleventh, are you going to be the one to fight against me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Little brat, watch your words! Since when is Eleventh something you can address me by?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Address your daddy as Lord Eleventh!&rdquo;<br>Eleventh was immediately extremely displeased.<br>&ldquo;Lord?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip; someone as despicable and shameless like you is worthy of the title &lsquo;Lord?&rsquo;&rdquo; sneered Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Motherfucker! Today, I must properly teach you a lesson!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brat, wear that! Should you dare to wear that, your daddy will beat you up so badly that you&rsquo;ll be looking for your teeth all over the floor, even worse than that old trash over there!&rdquo;<br>As Eleventh spoke, he pointed to Zhang Duotuo, who had already left the plaza, and was treating his injuries nearby.<br>Hearing those words, Zhang Duotuo and Meng Rufei&rsquo;s expressions turned very ugly.<br>They&rsquo;d already withdrawn from the stage, yet they were still being humiliated? This was simply intolerable.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng had already placed the special cape over himself.<br>He did not inspect it too much. After all, he had already inspected it when Eleventh was fighting against Zhang Duotuo.<br>The cape was a treasure.<br>Should one wear the cape, it seemed like one&rsquo;s cultivation would be restricted regardless of what level of cultivation one might have.<br>Only spirit power could be used after wearing the cape.<br>Unless one were to remove the cape, it would be akin to having lost one&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>Chu Feng had no idea where the Mystic Cave Saints had obtained the cape.<br>However, it could not be denied that it was a treasure.<br>&ldquo;Come. It seems that your defeat last time was still not miserable enough. I&rsquo;ll make you suffer even more this time.&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a provocative tone.<br>&ldquo;Little brat, your daddy was careless the last time around. This time, you will come to know how powerful your daddy is!&rdquo;<br>As he spoke, Eleventh placed his palms together. He did not directly attack Chu Feng. Instead, he began to set up a spirit formation.<br>As for Chu Feng, he also clasped his palms together and began to set up a spirit formation.<br>After witnessing the match between Eleventh and Zhang Duotuo, Chu Feng had realized that Eleventh was completely different from before. His spirit power had increased enormously.<br>That was not merely the change caused by his world spirit techniques increasing from Insect Mark to Snake Mark. His battle power had also increased greatly.<br>Thus, Chu Feng could not be too careless against him.<br>After all, he didn&rsquo;t know if Eleventh had gone all-out when he fought against Zhang Duotuo earlier.<br>&ldquo;Little brat, you actually dare to set up a spirit formation at the same time as your daddy?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you really think that you&rsquo;d be able to defeat your daddy&rsquo;s spirit formation with your own?&rdquo;<br>Eleventh was truly vulgar-mouthed. He did not possess the demeanor of an expert of the older generation. Instead, his behavior was more like that of a brat.<br>Even whilst setting up his spirit formation, his mouth was still moving and insulting Chu Feng nonstop.<br>&ldquo;You must&rsquo;ve forgotten how you were miserably beaten by me the last time around.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t remember how strong I am, you can go and ask your eldest brother how it feels to be toyed around with by an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist as a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist,&rdquo; as Chu Feng said those words, he took a provocative glance at the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;This damned brat dares to ridicule me?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eleventh, teach him a lesson! Beat him up till he starts calling for his daddy and mommy! Beat him up till he starts addressing us as ancestors!&rdquo; shouted the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Eldest brother, rest assured. I will have him realize how powerful we truly are.&rdquo; said Eleventh.<br>&ldquo;How powerful you truly are?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, then I guess I understand now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that even though you all managed to successfully sneak your way into the World Spirit Mansion Gate by cheating, your world spirit techniques were still suppressed by it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder you all were so weak then. You&rsquo;re simply the weakest world spiritists that I&rsquo;ve ever met.&rdquo; said Chu Feng mockingly.<br>&ldquo;Damned brat, you truly have a lot of bullshit to say.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re so fond of spouting bullshit, go ahead and say some more.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t quickly say more, you won&rsquo;t be able to speak anymore, because you&rsquo;ve already enraged me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Lord Eleventh, will soon make you cry.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Roooarr~~~&rdquo;<br>After Eleventh finished saying those words, boundless spirit power rushed out from his body.<br>The spirit power soared into the sky, spiraled around, and condensed into a giant dragon.<br>The dragon was over ten thousand meters long. Even though it was composed of spirit power, it was very realistic and life-like. It was like a real dragon as it roared majestically.<br>The dragon opened its ferocious mouth and made a straight line for Chu Feng.<br>It seemed like it was planning to devour Chu Feng with a single bite.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo; Chu Feng let out a cold snort.<br>Then, spirit power also soared forth from within his body.<br>His spirit power spiraled into the sky and gathered together, it too formed an enormous dragon.<br>This dragon was also ten thousand meters long. Both its size and aura was not at all weaker than that of the enormous dragon condensed by Eleventh.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Dragon roars sounded nonstop. It seemed like the roars would tear through the void.<br>In the blink of an eye, the two enormous dragons collided.<br>Heaven and earth darkened as thunder exploded nonstop.<br>Even heaven and earth was affected by the two enormous spirit formation dragons.<br>However, after a series of confrontations, the two dragons were still in a stalemate.<br>This outcome surprised the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Zhuanghong, that friend of yours is truly remarkable.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the elders from the Red-dress Holy Land all looked to Yin Zhuanghong, and were praising Chu Feng nonstop.<br>They actually had not had much expectations of him.<br>After all, Chu Feng had only just become a Snake Mark Saint-cloak World. Regardless of how talented he might be, he was only a person of the younger generation.<br>They felt that Chu Feng&rsquo;s application of world spirit techniques would definitely be inferior to the old monsters of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>The reason why they were willing to have Chu Feng fight on their behalf even though they thought that he would not be a match for the Mystic Cave Saints was because they had no choice.<br>They knew the personality of the Mystic Cave Saints very well. If they did not attempt to win back their treasure at that moment, they might no longer have any chance of doing so.<br>The Mystic Cave Saints were a bunch that would immediately run off after making gains.<br>Likely, in the future, no matter how their Red-dress Holy Land attempted to invite the Mystic Cave Saints over again, they would never return.<br>Thus, increasing their gambling stake and having Chu Feng fight on their behalf was simply the only choice they had. It could be said that they&rsquo;d decided to put everything in the gamble.<br>However, seeing that Chu Feng was actually able to be evenly matched against the Mystic Cave Saint&rsquo;s Eleventh, he might really be able to win.<br>Because of this, they were naturally pleased beyond their expectations.<br>At the moment when the people from the Red-dress Holy Land were feeling overjoyed, Zhang Duotuo was feeling very gloomy.<br>Even though Chu Feng was only evenly matched against Eleventh at that moment, he was at least able to be evenly matched.<br>He, Zhang Duotuo, on the other hand, had been defeated by the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; Eleventh in a single bout.<br>They were simply not on the same level at all.<br>This intense contrast caused even him to feel that he had been very humiliated.<br></p></div>
