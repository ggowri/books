        <div> - Publicly Fighting Over A Disciple<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Look! Someone appeared beside that person wearing the Saint Cloak!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;One can tell that person is an extraordinary individual just by his appearance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you blind? How can you not recognize that person? That is the renowned Saint-cloak World Spiritist, Grandmaster Long Xuan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah? He&rsquo;s Grandmaster Long Xuan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s Grandmaster Long Xuan?!&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Long Xuan&rsquo;s sudden appearance immediately caught the attention of the crowd.<br>Soon, a question emerged.<br>&lsquo;Why would Grandmaster Long Xuan appear here?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Could it be that he knows the person who obtained the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak?&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Long Xuan, what you&rsquo;re doing is quite dishonest,&rdquo; right at that moment, a voice transmission entered Grandmaster Long Xuan&rsquo;s ears. It was Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, how could you say such a thing in this sort of situation? If you&rsquo;re not afraid of being refused, you can directly reveal yourself too,&rdquo; replied Grandmaster Long Xuan replied through voice transmission.<br>Hearing those words, Grandmaster Liangqiu frowned. He understood what Grandmaster Long Xuan was planning to do, and also understood the intention behind it.<br>Grandmaster Long Xuan was planning to publicly ask Chu Feng to become his disciple.<br>However, he would be met with the risk of being publicly rejected by Chu Feng.<br>No matter what, Grandmaster Long Xuan was someone with reputation and status. If he were to be publicly rejected in front of all those people, it would be quite humiliating.<br>That was even more so if it was someone like Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Over the years, there had been countless individuals that wanted to become his disciple, but were instead rejected by him.<br>It had always only been him who rejected others, and never others that rejected him.<br>In fact, he had never actually expressed a desire to take someone as his disciple of his own accord.<br>Of course, there was an exception to that cast -- Chu Xuanyuan.<br>However, when Grandmaster Liangqiu asked Chu Xuanyuan to become his disciple, it was done in private, with only the two of them being witnesses.<br>Although he was refused by Chu Xuanyuan, it seemed that Chu Xuanyuan had never mentioned it to anyone. Thus, outsiders had no idea about it.<br>To outsiders, Grandmaster Liangqiu was someone that had never been rejected before. They also felt that no one would possibly refuse to become Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s disciple.<br>However, if he was to ask Chu Feng to become his disciple publicly, and end up being refused by him, everything would end up changing.<br>That was the reason why Grandmaster Liangqiu was somewhat hesitant.<br>He had obtained his current reputation and status through years of effort. It would be a lie to say that he did not care about his reputation and face.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, for you to appear here yet not speak nor answer me, could it be that you&rsquo;re planning to cause a sensation without exposing your identity?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, I don&rsquo;t care what you plan to do. You also don&rsquo;t have to tell me what you plan to do.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I actually have something that I wish to say to you today. This matter is somewhat presumptuous of me. However, this old man is extremely sincere.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am not someone who is fond of beating around the bush. Thus, I will not do so today. Today, I actually want to&hellip; eh&hellip;. It&rsquo;s still a bit presumptuous of me. I hope that you can prepare yourself for this, it would not be something trivial for either you or me,&rdquo; after Grandmaster Long Xuan appeared before Chu Feng, he continued to try to speak to Chu Feng through voice transmission.<br>Whilst Grandmaster Liangqiu was someone who cared about his reputation and face, how could he not be the same?<br>Thus, he wanted to properly communicate with Chu Feng through voice transmission.<br>If Chu Feng were to agree to it, it would bring delight to everyone. He would be able to have the people present become their witnesses, and publicly take Chu Feng as his disciple.<br>If he was refused, he would directly leave, and no one would know about it. With that, he would not end up in an awkward and embarrassing situation.<br>&ldquo;This aura?!&rdquo;<br>However, suddenly, Grandmaster Long Xuan&rsquo;s expression changed. He immediately turned to look to his side. Upon doing so, he discovered that a figure had appeared beside him. As for that person, it was none other than Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>After hesitating for some time, Grandmaster Liangqiu had made his decision.<br>He had decided to choose Chu Feng over his reputation and face.<br>&ldquo;Am I seeing things? That person&hellip; seems to be Grandmaster Liangqiu.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not seeing things at all, that person is none other than the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s strongest world spiritist, Grandmaster Liangqiu.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For Grandmaster Liangqiu to appear after Grandmaster Long Xuan&rsquo;s appearance, exactly what is going on here?&rdquo;<br>The appearance of Grandmaster Liangqiu caused the already excited crowd to burst into even greater excitement.<br>After all, compared to Grandmaster Long Xuan, Grandmaster Liangqiu was someone who possessed a higher tier of strength, status and reputation.<br>But, those two peak existences who stood at the apex of the Ancestral Martial Starfield were people that would simply not be seen normally. For many people, they would not be able to meet them in their entire lives. It would not even be excessive to call them legendary people.<br>Ignoring the fact that someone had managed to obtain the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, merely the appearance of either Grandmaster Liangqiu or Grandmaster Long Xuan was already extremely astonishing, something that was capable of stirring up the crowd&rsquo;s excitement.<br>And at that moment, the two of them actually appeared at the same time, and were both standing before the person wearing the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.<br>&lsquo;Could it be that they know each other?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;What will happen later on?&rsquo;<br>Those were the thoughts going through the crowd&rsquo;s minds.<br>However, compared to the excited crowd, Grandmaster Long Xuan became anxious.<br>He had made a gamble when he stood out at such a venue. He was betting on the fact that Grandmaster Liangqiu would not dare to reveal himself before all these people to voice his desire to take Chu Feng as his disciple.<br>With his understanding of Grandmaster Liangqiu, he was not someone who would take such risks.<br>However, the appearance of Grandmaster Liangqiu made him realize that his gamble seemed to have ended in failure.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Long Xuan wanted to talk with Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>However, Grandmaster Liangqiu did not even bother to glance at Grandmaster Long Xuan. Instead, he spoke directly to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Young friend, there&rsquo;s something that I wish to consult you on.&rdquo;<br>&lsquo;Young friend?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu addressed that person wearing the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak as &lsquo;young friend?&rsquo; Could it be&hellip; that that person is very young?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Or could it be that the person who breached the grand formation is a person of the younger generation?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;They know one another. They most definitely know one another. Regardless of who the person who breached the grand formation might be, Grandmaster Liangqiu definitely knows him.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;In that case, exactly who is that person who breached the grand formation left behind by the World Spiritist Immortal King?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Exactly what was it that Grandmaster Liangqiu wished to consult him on?&rsquo;<br>Many questions emerged in the crowd&rsquo;s minds upon hearing Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s words. At once, the crowd became even more excited.<br>Grandmaster Long Xuan, on the other hand, was panicking. Compared to the bystanders, he knew very well what Grandmaster Liangqiu planned to say.<br>Thus, Grandmaster Long Xuan rushed to speak first, &ldquo;Young friend, could you become my disciple?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah?????&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This?!!!!!!&rdquo;<br>Everyone present became greatly alarmed upon hearing Grandmaster Long Xuan&rsquo;s words. They had all imagined what was going to happen. However, never did they imagine that Grandmaster Long Xuan would want to take that person as his disciple.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, this old man&hellip; also wishes to take you as a disciple.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s voice sounded.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Am I mishearing things? Even Grandmaster Liangqiu&hellip;&rdquo;<br>After Grandmaster Liangqiu spoke, the crowd&rsquo;s astonishment reached its peak.<br>Even the people of the older generation opened their mouths wide in astonishment.<br>That person was the renowned, high and aloof Grandmaster Liangqiu! He actually, of his own accord, requested for someone to become his disciple?!!!!<br>Upon closer inspection, the crowd discovered that both Grandmaster Long Xuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu were looking at the person wearing the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak with sincerity.<br>They were most definitely not lying. These two grand existences were serious.<br>&lsquo;Exactly who is that person that breached the grand formation?!&rsquo;<br>That was the question, that everyone present had on their minds.<br></p></div>
