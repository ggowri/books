        <h1>Chapter 4862</h1>
        <div>: Chu Feng&rsquo;s Intention<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The waves gushed furiously as if an army was rampaging in the lake. There were no longer any traces of the calm lake they knew of. It looked more as if they were standing in the midst of a stormy ocean.<br>Weng!<br>The activation formation Chu Feng had constructed got even closer to the droplet of Condensed Divine Dew, and the Condensed Divine Dew began emanating a divine glow.<br>It no longer looked like a droplet of ordinary water anymore.<br>At the same time, the entire lake of Condensed Divine Dew also glowed with the same brilliance. Even the palace had started glowing in resonance too.<br>An air of inviolable sacredness enveloped the forbidden land.<br>&ldquo;Fuse!&rdquo; Chu Feng ordered with a roar.<br>What was unbelievable was that the activation formation seemed to understand the order and started fusing together with the Condensed Divine Dew.<br>Woosh!<br>A massive wave crashed down on the palace, but for some inexplicable reason, the palace swallowed up the lake water instead.<br>At the same time, the activation formation in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands began morphing as well, slowly transforming into the miniature model of the palace. By the time the transformation was completed, the lake outside had also calmed down.<br>However, Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother, Shengguang Yunyue, and Shengguang Haifu couldn&rsquo;t calm the torrential shock rushing through their hearts.<br>The huge accumulation of Condensed Divine Dew had vanished without a trace, leaving a massive pit that extended to the horizon. But what was even shocking was that the palace they were still inside a moment ago had vanished as well.<br>That was an ancient treasure!<br>They turned their eyes toward the activation formation in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands, where a glistening miniature model of the palace stood.<br>It was apparent to everyone where the Condensed Divine Dew and the ancient treasure had gone. It was all in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands now.<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Yunyue, you traitor! I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Haifu&rsquo;s killing intent flared up as he raised his palm to strike down on Shengguang Yunyue. He thought that Shengguang Yunyue had colluded with Chu Feng to steal the cultivation formation prepared by the clan chief.<br>Uwa!<br>But before Shengguang Haifu&rsquo;s palm could land on Shengguang Yunyue, his body had already been pressed down onto the ground. It was Chu Feng&rsquo;s doing.<br>&ldquo;Her life belongs to me now. Until I choose to take her life, no one can kill her,&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered coldly.<br>It was ironic how a lofty grand elder of the Holy Light Clan was now no more than trash in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how did you do it?&rdquo; Shengguang Yunyue asked in astonishment.<br>The method she had relayed to Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t wrong, but it was ineffective. They had tried it far too many times to know that.<br>So, how did Chu Feng succeed on his first try?<br>&ldquo;I did it using your method. Ah, the one who imparted the activation method to you is your clan chief?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Shengguang Yunyue replied.<br>&ldquo;That explains it. Overall, the formation is right. There are slight problems with the details, but fortunately, those aren&rsquo;t too difficult to fix. I only had to make minor adjustments,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Impossible! Our clan chief has also tried making modifications to the activation formation too, but not once has he succeeded. How are you able to succeed on the first try?&rdquo; Shengguang<br>exclaimed in disbelief.<br>&ldquo;Is that very hard for you to believe? I guess I should have expected this. It&rsquo;s similar to how a pig wouldn&rsquo;t believe that there are beings in the world that can walk on two legs because it isn&rsquo;t able to do so,&rdquo; Chu Feng scoffed in disdain.<br>&ldquo;You dare insult me?&rdquo; Shengguang<br>roared with clenched jaws.<br>He could tell that Chu Feng was saying that their Holy Light Clan was filled with fools.<br>&ldquo;Feeling aggrieved? Ah, I nearly forgot. The one who told me the way to activate the cultivation formation is Shengguang Yunyue, which means that according to our promise, this goes to you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng took out the black vat and opened it.<br>Shoosh!<br>Black smoke first rose from the vat before black snakes with legs reminiscent like a centipede crawled out from within.<br>&ldquo;W-what are you going to do? Kill me if you wish to! Such tricks won&rsquo;t work on me!&rdquo;<br>Despite Shengguang Haifu&rsquo;s earlier tough stance, he panicked the moment he saw the creatures crawling out of the black vat.<br>&ldquo;Too late. How could you think of dying when I&rsquo;m giving you a present here? Make sure to savor every moment of it. This is my bestowment to you in view of your loyalty toward the Holy Light Clan!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng raised his finger, and those black snakes dived straight into Shengguang Haifu&rsquo;s body.<br>Gahhh!<br>Shengguang Haifu immediately began screaming in agony the moment the black snakes squirmed into his body. It was even noisier than when Chu Feng used those snakes against Shengguang Yunyue.<br>It was only at this point that Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother finally understood why Shengguang Yunyue was so frightened of Chu Feng. She shuddered to imagine just what kind of cruelty Shengguang Yunyue had been through, though it was not as if she would sympathize with someone who had threatened her and her daughter.<br>Same as before, Chu Feng quickly erected a barrier to muffle Shengguang Haifu&rsquo;s screaming before dragging the two of them into his gourd.<br>He knew better than to linger in the area for too long.<br>&ldquo;Elder, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;<br>He quickly took his leave together with Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother. It was only when they were finally at a safe place that he finally halted.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother was just about to thank Chu Feng for his help when Chu Feng suddenly pulled out a person from his Cosmos Sack, and her eyes immediately turned moist. It was Long Xiaoxiao.<br>Long Xiaoxiao was also overwhelmed when she saw her mother standing safely before her. She knew right away that Chu Feng had succeeded.<br>&ldquo;Mother!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao!!!&rdquo;<br>The mother and daughter embraced one another and broke down into tears. Far too many bad things had happened to them during this period of time that it left them despaired.<br>However, it felt like all of the bad things had finally come to an end now that they had reunited with one another. Nothing else mattered as long as they were both safe.<br>After venting their emotions, Long Xiaoxiao quickly explained the situation to her mother.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I really don&rsquo;t know how I should thank you.&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother spoke hoarsely as she began getting down to her knees.<br>Chu Feng quickly rushed forward to stop her.<br>&ldquo;Elder, there&rsquo;s no need for such formality. It won&rsquo;t do for you to kneel down to a junior like me. It&rsquo;s only right for me to help you given the ties between me and Xiaoxiao. I trust that Xiaoxiao would also do the same for me if I were to meet with trouble.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng turned to Long Xiaoxiao and asked, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;<br>However, Long Xiaoxiao tilted her chin up proudly and replied, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to say. I&rsquo;m not as dumb as you.&rdquo;<br>Both Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother burst into laughter. They knew better than anyone else how Long Xiaoxiao would react if anything were to happen to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, elder, what do you two plan to do next?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow you no matter where you go. Chu Feng, I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, but I won&rsquo;t let you shake me off this time around,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao said with a pout, though her eyes were filled with determination.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, what I&rsquo;m going to do next has nothing to do with you anymore. I&rsquo;m intending to settle the scores with the Holy Light Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I know, but do you think that I, Long Xiaoxiao, have no scores to settle with the Holy Light Clan? Chu Feng, I know that I won&rsquo;t be of any help to you with my limited strength, but I still wish to see you crushing the Holy Light Clan with my own eyes. If you wish to go, you have to bring me with me!&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao insisted.<br>&ldquo;Alright alright, it looks like I can&rsquo;t do anything about you.&rdquo;<br>In truth, he had already guessed that Long Xiaoxiao would be reluctant to leave him at this juncture.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what are you planning to do next?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked.<br>&ldquo;I already have an idea of what I&rsquo;m going to do next. However, I&rsquo;ll need its help.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng took out the swan-shaped cultivation formation and looked at it with eyes filled with anticipation.<br></p></div>
