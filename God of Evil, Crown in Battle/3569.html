        <h1>Chapter 3568</h1>
        <div> - Existence From The Ancient Era<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After coming to a decision, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief began to give out orders.<br>He summoned all of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen to him.<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was planning to gather all of his clansmen to take on the challenge together.<br>Using the power of the Void Sacred Tree, Chu Feng also called all the powers from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm and the various other powers to gather.<br>Everyone could participate in the attempt to enter the Sacred Palace Hall. Chu Feng wanted to give everyone the opportunity to choose.<br>Even though it was very dangerous to attempt to enter the Sacred Palace Hall, Chu Feng still wanted to give all of them the privilege of making their choice.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, are you able to tell us what you know now?&rdquo; Finally, Tantai Yinjian voiced his question.<br>That was actually what everyone wanted to know too.<br>Chu Feng began to inform the crowd about what he knew.<br>It turned out that the other method to open the gate to the Sacred Palace Hall besides refining the souls of a hundred million people was to use the power of the Void Sacred Tree.<br>That was the reason why Chu Feng could not do it on his own, and needed the assistance of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Opening the gate to enter the Sacred Palace Hall would mainly be dependent on the two of them.<br>That said, opening the gate was so dangerous that it could be said that one would have a ninety percent chance of death.<br>Furthermore, anyone that wished to enter the Sacred Palace Hall would have to undertake the same sort of risk as Chu Feng and the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>In other words, if they chose to enter the Sacred Palace Hall, their life and death would be placed in Chu Feng and the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s hands.<br>If they succeeded, not only would everyone be able to live, but they would also be able to enter the legendary Sacred Palace Hall.<br>If they failed, not only would they die, but their corpses would not even remain intact.<br>&ldquo;How could we accept that? How could we allow our lives to be placed in the hands of a demon clansman?&rdquo;<br>After hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s explanation, people immediately voiced their objections.<br>&ldquo;Do you think that this old man is willing to bring you all in?&rdquo; The Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief snorted coldly. His tone was filled with contempt.<br>As for Chu Feng, he did not say anything. Instead, it was Tantai Yinjian who spoke, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng is showing his kind intentions. As for whether to enter or not, it is up to the individual to decide.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man is willing to give it a try.&rdquo;<br>Right after his words left his mouth, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief expressed his position.<br>Following that, all of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen present also declared their position.<br>After them, people from various powers began to arrive in succession.<br>In a short hour, there were over twenty million people gathered. Furthermore, more and more people were still arriving.<br>Of course, the people that arrived later were mostly people from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. They were all relatively weak by comparison.<br>Chu Feng did not look down on them because of their cultivation. Instead, he informed them of the matter regarding the Sacred Palace Hall.<br>After learning about it, the newcomers all began to declare their positions.<br>In the end, there were three hundred and ninety thousand people that expressed their willingness to follow Chu Feng and the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief in their attempt.<br>Although three hundred and ninety thousand people was truly little compared to the more than twenty million people present, so much that they could not even begin to compare to one another, it remained that attempting to enter the Sacred Palace Hall was an act with a ninety percent chance of death, and the crowd were all afraid of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen. Thus, it was only normal for them to be unwilling to enter.<br>Thus, those three hundred and ninety thousand people could all be said to be very courageous.<br>Not only were they courageous, they were also very confident in Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, the Void Sacred Tree will eventually close. Let us stop waiting for any more people,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Very well, let us begin then,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>Then, the people that had decided to follow Chu Feng and brave the risk all stepped onto a vast vacant land.<br>As for the others, some decided to leave to continue to seek out Sacred Tree Fruits, but the great majority of them stayed. They wanted to witness what would happen.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, heaven and earth started to tremble violently. Power visible to the naked eye surged forth like a volcanic eruption. Soon, that power filled the entire spacious region.<br>That said, that enormous power only appeared for a short period.<br>It could be said that the power had disappeared in an instant.<br>After that power disappeared, Chu Feng and the others also disappeared.<br>Only the people that stood outside that vast and spacious location remained. They stared at the completely empty region with complicated expressions.<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>Somewhere in the Void Sacred Tree, Wang Qiang and the undead man were still watching the mirror-like lake.<br>The image that was being shown on the lake was the vacant land that Chu Feng and the others had disappeared from.<br>&ldquo;They actually really chose that method?&rdquo; The undead man&rsquo;s voice sounded very profound.<br>&ldquo;Old Fart, qu-quickly, h-have a look at h-how they&rsquo;re d-do-doing now,&rdquo; Wang Qiang had a very nervous expression on his face.<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see them. They&rsquo;ve entered the actual Sacred Palace Hall. They will either die in there or come out alive. As for what they&rsquo;re going through, we are unable to see it,&rdquo; the undead man said.<br>&ldquo;Un-unable to se-see it? W-What kind of j-joke are you sp-spouting? A-aren&rsquo;t you t-the ma-ma-master of this place? A-aren&rsquo;t you able to control e-everything?&rdquo; Wang Qiang said.<br>The undead man shook his head, &ldquo;I merely grasped the power of this place. I am not the master of it. There is only one actual master of this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;The Void Sacred Tree,&rdquo; the undead man said.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Wang Qiang felt completely baffled. Shortly afterward, he asked, &ldquo;Y-you-you&rsquo;re saying t-that the tree is alive?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;W-wh-wh-what exactly is g-going on here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I entered this place because the power of the Void Sacred Tree is able to assist in my resurrection.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I&rsquo;ve grasped the power of this place, it is actually only a portion of this place&rsquo;s power. The Void Sacred Tree still has its own way of thinking. It is the true ruler of this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for where it came from and what sort of purpose it has, I also do not know,&rdquo; the undead man said.<br>&ldquo;Y-you don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;D-didn&rsquo;t you sa-say that you&rsquo;re from the A-ancie-ancient E-e-era? Wha-what could you possibly not know a-about?&rdquo; Wang Qiang had a look of disbelief.<br>&ldquo;I am indeed from the Ancient Era. However, my memory has been damaged. There are a lot of things that I cannot remember. However, my memories will return sooner or later. If you continue to follow me, you will find out eventually,&rdquo; the undead man said with a faint smile as he looked at Wang Qiang. However, his smile was somewhat strange. That smile caused even Wang Qiang to feel slightly uneasy.<br>&ldquo;T-their choice to open the Sacred P-palace Hall, is it t-truly a ninety percent chance of d-death?&rdquo; asked Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Ninety percent chance of death?&rdquo; the undead man smiled. Then, with a wave of his sleeve, the surrounding region immediately turned pitch-black.<br>There was only a firefly-sized light far in the distance.<br>&ldquo;Do you see that light?&rdquo; the undead man pointed to the weak light far away.<br>&ldquo;I see it,&rdquo; Wang Qiang&rsquo;s gaze was fixed onto that light.<br>&ldquo;If that light is their chance of living through the journey, then the darkness would represent the chance of death,&rdquo; the undead man said.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Wang Qiang jumped in shock upon hearing those words. Not only did he have an expression of worry on his face, but anger also filled his face.<br>&ldquo;O-Old B-Bastard, if y-you-you knew that it was th-that dangerous, w-why didn&rsquo;t y-you stop them?! T-that&rsquo;s m-my brother of-of all people!&rdquo; Wang Qiang shouted angrily.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already told you that I have only grasped the power of this place, and i am not the master. When the master of this place acts, I am also powerless to do anything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you think opening the gate to the Sacred Palace Hall was something that one could accomplish at will?&rdquo; the undead man asked.<br>&ldquo;W-what e-exactly do y-you mean by t-th-that? J-just tell me w-whether or not y-you c-can s-save them, don-don&rsquo;t b-beat around the bush,&rdquo; Wang Qiang spoke with a face full of anxiety. After all, this concerned Chu Feng&rsquo;s life and death.<br>&ldquo;To put it simply, they were only able to open the gate to the Sacred Palace Hall because they were allowed to by the Void Sacred Tree.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is the Void Sacred Tree that wanted them to go in.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is also the Void Sacred Tree that wanted them to take on this challenge.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When the actual master of this place acts, even I&hellip; can only watch with folded arms,&rdquo; the undead man said.<br></p></div>
