        <div>: Hunting Spirit Beasts<br>&ldquo;Elder, tell me more about the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s junior hunting competition,&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Song Yuwei began sharing the details of the competition with him.<br>The realm they were heading to also fell under the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s jurisdiction. It used to be known by another name, but the founder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan changed its name to the currently used Spirit Beast Upper Realm.<br>While the Situ World Spiritist Clan might not seem like a big deal now, its founder used to be a renowned powerhouse in the Totem Galaxy. Back when he was still in his prime, the Situ World Spiritist Clan was able to stand toe to toe with other major powers in the Totem Galaxy.<br>It was just that the Situ World Spiritist Clan had gradually declined over the years since then.<br>Back then, the founder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan discovered a mountain range filled with concentrated spirit power in an Upper Realm. This spirit power was imbued with an attribute that disallowed world spiritists from assimilating it to nurture their own spirit power, but they could utilize it to reinforce the formations they constructed.<br>Needless to say, this was extremely useful to world spiritists.<br>It took a great deal of time, effort, and enlightenment for a world spiritist to raise their spirit power, but the spirit power in the mountain range could be used to reinforce their formation.<br>The only downside was that the spirit power in the mountain range had to undergo a special processing procedure before it could be used.<br>There was no way the founder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan would allow this treasure he had found to go to waste. After some experimentation, he eventually developed a way that allowed world spiritists to utilize the spirit power.<br>The method was to rear spirit beasts inside the mountain range and have them absorb the spirit power and grow. Once they reached a certain level of maturity, the world spiritists would consume and assimilate them.<br>Through that, the world spiritists would be able to indirectly absorb the mountain valley&rsquo;s spirit power and strengthen their own spirit power.<br>Even so, there were still some limitations here.<br>It took time for the spirit beasts to come to maturity, and even so, the only ones who were able to assimilate the spirit power were junior world spiritists.<br>In view of that, the founder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan constructed a humongous formation to seal off the mountain range. This ensured that outsiders wouldn&rsquo;t be able to secretly prey on the spirit beasts while they were maturing in the mountain range.<br>The formation would only open once every fifty years and release some of the reared spirit beasts for the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan to assimilate. Any spirit beasts they successfully hunted down would be converted into a stream of spirit power that flowed into their body and augmented their own spirit power.<br>Rumors had it that there were special spirit beasts in the mountain valley containing the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s secret formation. Anyone who successfully hunted down these spirit beasts would receive a huge amount of spirit power and the secret formation hidden in them.<br>These secret formations were either created or acquired by the founder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan but weren&rsquo;t passed down through the lineage. Nevertheless, through the brief introductions about these secret formations in the archives, it was clear that they weren&rsquo;t to be made light of.<br>Due to that, this competition drew great attention from not only within the Situ World Spiritist Clan but those from other powers too. They would travel to the Spirit Beast Upper Realm to see how the prodigies of the Situ World Spiritist Clan performed.<br>This was especially so for the upcoming one as the current generation of juniors in the Situ World Spiritist Clan were known to be exceptionally talented. Just fifty years ago, a junior had successfully hunted one of the spirit beasts that contained a secret formation.<br>The secret formation wasn&rsquo;t particularly powerful, but the last time any junior had killed a spirit beast containing a secret formation was over ten thousand years ago. That only reflected just how difficult the feat was.<br>Not to mention, the junior who pulled off the feat was only 48 years old back then, meaning that he was still a junior now and could participate in the junior hunting competition.<br>There were also plenty of outstanding juniors in the Situ World Spiritist Clan who didn&rsquo;t pale in comparison to him. This could be said to be the strongest line-up of the Situ World Spiritist Clan since the first junior hunting competition.<br>It was only natural for it to draw attention.<br>&ldquo;Elder Yuwei, is the founder of the Situ World Spiritist Clan extremely powerful?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s extremely powerful. Back when he was still in his prime, he single-handedly brought the Situ World Spiritist Clan to a point where it was only second to the Totem Dragon Clan. Unfortunately, that was not a place where they belonged, and the clan swiftly declined after the founder&rsquo;s death. On top of that, their clan members grew increasingly vile after having a taste of power,&rdquo; Song Yuwei replied with a sigh.<br>&ldquo;Will I be able to enter the hunt?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng initially intended to use this opportunity to capture the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan in a single swoop, but his interest in the junior hunting competition was piqued after hearing about its background. He thought that he might stumble upon fortuitous encounters as a world spiritist there.<br>&ldquo;Only juniors with the bloodline of the Situ World Spiritist Clan are able to enter the formation around the mountain valley, but there&rsquo;s an exception to that rule. The Situ World Spiritist Clan occasionally invites guests to join the hunt as well. The invitees would be handed a guest token that grants them entry through the formation, though they would have to be a junior too,&rdquo; Song Yuwei said.<br>&ldquo;Does the Situ World Spiritist Clan hand out these guest tokens every time they hold the junior hunting competition?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Song Yuwei shook her head.<br>&ldquo;It has been a long time since the Situ World Spiritist Clan last gave out any guest token. They are currently in their weakest ever state, and they are depending on this junior hunting competition to revert to their former glory. Not to mention, there are spirit beasts in there that contain powerful secret formations. They wouldn&rsquo;t allow something like that to fall into the hands of outsiders,&rdquo; Song Yuwei said.<br>Chu Feng fell into deep thought. He was thinking about how he could get into the mountain valley to join the hunt.<br>&ldquo;What if I hold a junior of the Situ World Spiritist Clan hostage or dig out their dantian and hide it within my body? Do you think it&rsquo;s possible for me to deceive the formation around the mountain valley?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible to do that. Someone has actually done it before, though he paid a heavy price for that. While the elders from the Situ World Spiritist Clan cannot interfere with what happens inside the mountain valley, there&rsquo;s no way they would allow someone who dared hurt one of their clan members and sneak into their territory get away scot-free.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, young master Chu Feng, you need to think things through before going ahead with this. You need to at least ensure that you&rsquo;ll be able to make your escape,&rdquo; Song Yuwei said.<br>She had already learned from Chu Feng that his Asura World Spirit Army had been sealed, so he could only rely on his own cultivation. Needless to say, she was worried about Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Elder Yuwei. I&rsquo;ll make preparations accordingly,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br></div>
