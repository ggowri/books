        <h1>Chapter 3684</h1>
        <div> - Not Necessarily<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Crap! This is bad!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the situation was bad, the people behind the Blood-devouring Hall immediately turned around to flee.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after they set off to escape, martial power emerged from all directions like massive tides. The martial power formed a cage that trapped all of them inside.<br>&ldquo;Screwed, we&rsquo;re screwed.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that their escape was sealed, those people realized that this Utmost Exalted-level expert was most likely not going to let them get away easily. Because of that, they were scared witless.<br>&ldquo;Utmost Exalted, is it really an Utmost Exalted?&rdquo;<br>Compared to the fear in the people that were there to massacre the Chu Heavenly Clan, the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were actually curious.<br>To many of them, the Utmost Exalted realm was merely a legend. They had never encountered an Utmost Exalted-level existence in their entire lives.<br>However, had an Utmost Exalted realm expert really come? Furthermore, was that person really here to stand up for the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm?<br>One should know that when Chu Xuanyuan made that massive blunder and was banished to be imprisoned to the Lower Realm, no Utmost Exalted-level existence stood up for him.<br>Thus, would there really be an Utmost Exalted-level existence willing to assist the Chu Heavenly Clan?<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan actually had enough face to move an Utmost Exalted?<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re already here, why not show yourself?&rdquo;<br>The leader of the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall spoke.<br>He was acting extremely calm and composed as he spoke. There was no trace of fear at all.<br>&ldquo;Blood-devouring Hall, this old man has tolerated the myriad of evil you all have conducted in the past. Yet, you now actually want to kill a genius of our Ancestral Martial Starfield? That's something this old man cannot tolerate,&rdquo; an aged yet powerful voice was heard. Following that, two figures appeared beside Chu Feng.<br>Seeing those two people, Chu Feng was immediately overjoyed.<br>One of them was Liangqiu Chengfeng. As for the other individual, he was someone even more amazing. He was the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s strongest world spiritist, Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Most importantly, Grandmaster Liangqiu was not only a Dragon Marked Saint-cloak World Spiritist, but he was also an Utmost Exalted-level expert.<br>The oppressive might that covered the surroundings, ruling everything, was his oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, it&rsquo;s actually Grandmaster Liangqiu?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Someone like him is actually standing up for our Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>Not to mention the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen felt utter disbelief.<br>After all, to the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan, Grandmaster Liangqiu was a legendary existence of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>Their Chu Heavenly Clan did not have any relationship with someone like him.<br>Besides, Grandmaster Liangqiu was a centrist, and would never involve himself in the affairs of other powers.<br>Yet, at this moment, he'd actually made an exception. Furthermore, making this exception, he decided to offend the most dangerous power in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, the Blood-devouring Hall?<br>What could have caused Grandmaster Liangqiu to be willing to take such risks?<br>Chu Feng?<br>Soon, the crowd thought of a possibility.<br>Apart from Chu Feng, no one else would be capable of making someone like Grandmaster Liangqiu stand up for the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, are you alright?&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, Grandmaster Liangqiu looked to Chu Feng with deep concern.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this junior is fine,&rdquo; answered Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve exhausted yourself. For the sake of stalling for time, you&rsquo;ve deliberately allowed yourself to be wounded by those despicable thugs,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;What? Deliberately?&rdquo;<br>The crowd&rsquo;s expression changed upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;This junior had been forced into a corner, and had no other choice. I could only try my hardest to stall for time and hope that the heavens would allow me to escape this calamity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected that while the heavens didn&rsquo;t help me, senior came to my rescue.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, you have saved my Chu Heavenly Clan today. This junior will forever remember your grace.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng bowed respectfully to Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words had confirmed Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s statement. With this, everyone came to realize that he had actually deliberately stalling for time so that someone could come to his rescue.<br>Even though his action was one of trying his luck, it was still very admirable.<br>Of course, the only ones that were feeling admiration for Chu Feng were the Chu Heavenly Clansmen and the people from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. The crusading army, on the other hand, were all gnashing their teeth in rage.<br>They had all fallen for his scheme.<br>&ldquo;This old man just so happened to be in the vicinity of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. After I heard what happened to your father, I worried that people might try to create trouble. Never would I have imagined that troublemakers would really show up.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fortunately, young friend Chu Feng is quick-witted, and managed to delay them. Otherwise, the consequences would be unthinkable,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Pa, pa, pa, pa~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a series of claps were heard. Looking over, it was actually the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall.<br>They were showing no fear on their faces, and were even clapping. They seemed like they were provoking Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, you are truly one to boast. You speak as if you&rsquo;re capable of saving the Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We will give you a word of advice. It's best that you leave immediately. This matter has nothing to do with you. Don&rsquo;t throw away your life and the life of your beloved disciple for this,&rdquo; said an expert from the Blood-devouring Hall.<br>&ldquo;Evildoers, today, this old man shall teach you all a lesson.&rdquo;<br>As Grandmaster Liangqiu spoke, the oppressive might that filled the heaven and earth started to change. They rushed to oppress the eight experts.<br>&ldquo;This!!!&rdquo;<br>However, in the next moment, Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s expression turned ugly.<br>He was shocked to discover that his oppressive might was actually unable to cause harm to the eight Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s experts.<br>Someone had blocked his oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;Tsk, tsk, tsk.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a laugh that could cause one&rsquo;s hair to stand on end was heard.<br>Then, a figure appeared before the eight experts from the Blood-devouring Hall.<br>That person was also wearing the same crimson, blood-red gown like the other eight.<br>However, he was wearing a fierce devilish-looking red armored mask. That mask appeared very terrifying.<br>Upon seeing that person, even Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng&rsquo;s expressions took a huge change. Unease appeared on their faces.<br>The reason for that was because the person who had appeared was the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over. We&rsquo;re done for. No wonder the Blood-devouring Hall is so confident. Turns out this demon also came here.&rdquo;<br>After seeing the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen that thought that they had been saved immediately revealed looks of despair.<br>The Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master was not only an Utmost Exalted-level expert, but he also possessed extremely strong battle power. He had practically been undefeated his entire life.<br>It was common knowledge among the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield that if the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master personally set off to accomplish a task, they would never fail.<br>It was precisely because of how infamous he was that even though Grandmaster Liangqiu was also a rank one Utmost Exalted, he revealed a look of worry upon seeing the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s gown moved. Like a flood, the oppressive might in his body rushed forth, filling the entire region.<br>His oppressive might was so strong that he actually managed to forcibly suppress Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;What terror! They&rsquo;re done for! Absolutely toast! With such an existence here, who could possibly save the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The heavens want to bring forth the destruction of the Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>Sensing the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s oppressive might, the bystanders all started to shiver in fear. They even stuttered as they spoke.<br>Never in their life had they ever sensed such a powerful aura before. It was not only the might of that oppressive might. There was also that killing intent present in the oppressive might. That killing intent was even more terrifying.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Liangqiu, the reason why I didn&rsquo;t do anything the entire time is because I was trying to give you a chance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, you no longer have that chance anymore,&rdquo; the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said coldly.<br>However, to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, right after his words were said, another voice sounded explosively.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not necessarily so!&rdquo;<br></p></div>
