        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>There was suddenly a ripple from the gate, and the barrier that was blocking the way became visible before abruptly dissipating before everyone&rsquo;s eyes. The gate creaked open, revealing a crack.</span><br><span>This crack was tiny compared to the gate, but it was more than enough for everyone to enter.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It has opened!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd began making their way toward the gate, with the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen at the forefront. However, they stumbled upon another barrier when they came close to the gate.</span><br><span>This barrier was extremely thick. While it didn&rsquo;t directly keep them out, it significantly halted their speed of advancement.</span><br><span>The Totem Phoenix Clansmen and Totem Dragon Clansmen soon reached the gate as well and encountered the same obstruction hindering the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? It feels uncomfortable.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen frowned.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Persist on and advance.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Chengyu also felt extremely uncomfortable, but he was determined not to lose when he saw how none of the Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen had any intention of retreating.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Long Muxi&rsquo;s voice suddenly sounded.</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen immediately halted their footsteps to look over, only to see that Chu Feng was completely unable to breach the thick barrier.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t enter,&rdquo; he honestly replied.</span><br><span>While this barrier applied a resistance force toward others who tried to breach it, reminiscent of walking in water, to Chu Feng, it was somehow no different from a normal solid barrier. He was unable to breach it at all.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha! That&rsquo;s the man who saved you all from the Demon Crane? I was wondering how formidable he is, seeing how you heed his words so much, but who could have thought that his bloodline power is so weak that he can&rsquo;t even clear the first trial at all?&rdquo; the rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman sneered.</span><br><span>The other Blood-eyed Qilin Clansmen burst into laughter too. They must have been lingering around the Immemorial Star Sea when the Demon Crane arrived, or else they wouldn&rsquo;t have known about the events that transpired in the Demon Crane.</span><br><span>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s all there is to Chu Feng.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Some from the Totem Phoenix Clan mocked him too.</span><br><span>Jealousy was truly a scary thing. Some of them harbored animosity toward Chu Feng for hogging the limelight even though he had saved their lives. Of course, it might have been because he fleeced them too.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu and Long Muxi returned to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side, hoping to pull him in from </span><span>the inside. To their astonishment, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t really lying at all. The barrier was firmly keeping him out like an iron wall, not allowing him in at all.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Why is this barrier discriminating against you? Chu Feng, are you able to tell what&rsquo;s amiss about the barrier?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not.&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head. He, too, was confused about what was going on.</span><br><span>Long Chengyu turned to the rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman and asked, &ldquo;You mentioned bloodline earlier. What does this place have to do with bloodlines?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Instead of answering the question, the rank five Half-God level Blood-eyed Qilin Clansman mocked Long Chengyu, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know? I thought that there was nothing the famed Long Chengyu doesn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s really asking for a beating!&rdquo; Long Chengyu&rsquo;s eyes blazed with anger.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Forget it. It&rsquo;s not time to cross blows with him yet,&rdquo; Long Muxi advised.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You go in first. Don&rsquo;t miss out on the initiative,&rdquo; Chu Feng reminded.</span><br><span>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll be head in first. Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t force yourself if you really can&rsquo;t enter. Just wait here for us, all right? We&rsquo;ll clear my father&rsquo;s mission with our own strength this time around.&rdquo; Long Chengyu patted Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulder with a smile before heading forward.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t bother with the barrier anymore. Just stay here,&rdquo; Long Muxi said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan very dangerous?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Long Muxi through voice transmission.</span><br><span>He had known Long Muxi to be a temperamental person, but she actually held herself back here and even calmed Long Chengyu down despite not having any goodwill toward the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan. This showed that the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan was not to be meddled with.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Rest assured. We can deal with it.&rdquo; Long Muxi smiled at Chu Feng before heading off.</span><br><span>The barrier was weird. Despite being invisible, it hindered his vision of the Totem Dragon Clansmen. It took only moments for them to disappear from his line of sight.</span><br><span>Chu Feng refused to give up. He continued examining the barrier, but he was unable to see through it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Forget it, Chu Feng. The barrier might have a restriction specifically against you. My guess is that the restriction allows only monstrous beasts in. No matter how much the Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen resemble humans, they are still monstrous beasts. However, you&rsquo;re different. You&rsquo;re a human through and through,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng had also guessed the same too. While he didn&rsquo;t know who the requester was, it was clear from the three clans the person had decided to engage that there were conditions one had to fulfill to enter the gate.</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clan and Totem Phoenix Clan were two of the strongest monstrous beast clans in the world of cultivation, whereas the Blood-eyed Qilin Clan was no pushover either. Their powerful bloodlines were probably why the requester had engaged them in the first place.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you have any guesses as to who the requester is? He seems to be a formidable person,&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It must be someone of equivalent standing to the Totem Dragon Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng </span><span>replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re stating the obvious.&rdquo; Eggy rolled her eyes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m also curious to know who that person is,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile. &ldquo;Forget it. Since I can&rsquo;t enter the barrier, I should make use of this time to assimilate the Dragon Inner Pills.&rdquo;</span><br><span>He sat down on the ground and took out the hundred Dragon Inner Pills along with a couple of others. Normally, these pills could only be absorbed by Totem Dragon Clansmen, but Chu Feng could refine these pills to alter their properties and fully unleash their medicinal energy.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, would these pills be enough for you to make a breakthrough?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;As potent as the Dragon Inner Pills are, I&rsquo;m a rank two Half-God level cultivator. I don&rsquo;t think these will be enough. Nevertheless, it should still be of significant help to me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he started to construct a formation.</span><br><span>It didn&rsquo;t take him long for him to construct refinement formations on those pills before stowing them away. While his spirit power was much stronger than before, he still needed some time to refine those pills.</span><br><span>He was planning to cultivate since he couldn&rsquo;t leave this area, but he suddenly heard a voice.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Your friends will meet with danger.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Alarmed, Chu Feng vigilantly scanned his surroundings. He didn&rsquo;t know where the voice came from, but he could tell that the person who had just spoken to him was no ordinary individual.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Chu Feng?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Eggy, didn&rsquo;t you hear the earlier voice?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear a thing.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Was I the only one who heard it?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng was stunned. The fact that Eggy didn&rsquo;t hear the earlier voice despite sharing his sight and hearing could only mean that the owner of the voice had intentionally blocked her out. Most likely, the other party was stronger than he had imagined.</span><br></p></div>
