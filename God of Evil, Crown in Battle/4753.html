        <h1>Chapter 4752</h1>
        <div>: The Emergence of the Hellking<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aside from the vicious beasts, Li Muzhi and the others also encountered many personal disciples from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect along the way. However, they didn&rsquo;t try to stop those personal disciples from running away from the danger as everyone was entitled to make their own decisions.<br>Soon, they arrived at the depths of the black tornado, which was sealed off by a furious barrage of lightning. It was fortunate that the destructive prowess of the tornado had yet to fully show itself, so they were still able to hold on.<br>After rushing their way, they soon arrived at the eye of the black tornado, but there were already several disciples there by the time they arrived.<br>Aside from the personal disciples, there were the eighth rank and ninth rank Hidden Dragon Disciples too, the Duanmu Brothers.<br>However, the strongest one present wasn&rsquo;t the two of them. A young man stood on top of a rank three Martial Exalted level vicious beast, and he emanated the aura of a rank three Martial Exalted level cultivator too.<br>He was the third rank Hidden Dragon Disciple, Zuoqiu Yanliang.<br>&ldquo;Li Muzhi, you all&hellip; actually managed to control the vicious beasts?&rdquo;<br>Li Muzhi and the others were riding on Martial Exalted level beasts when they arrived, so it was inevitable that they would attract the attention of the other disciples right away. Other than Zuoqiu Yanliang, the others all revealed looks of astonishment.<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to Senior Zuoqiu.&rdquo;<br>Li Muzhi ignored the others for the time being and quickly bowed slightly to Zuoqiu Yanliang. Even someone as proud as Li Muzhi dared not to disrespect him, which showed the prestige Zuoqiu Yanliang enjoyed even amongst the Hidden Dragon Disciples.<br>&ldquo;Li Muzhi, did you come here to stop this calamity too?&rdquo; Zuoqiu Yanliang asked.<br>His tone was lofty like a king interrogating his servants. They were all disciples of the same sect, but somehow, he acted as if Li Muzhi and the others were beneath him.<br>&ldquo;It concerns the safety of all our disciples, so I wanted to contribute a little too,&rdquo; Li Muzhi replied.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unlikely that you would be able to contribute anything at all, but at least you do have some sincerity,&rdquo; Zuoqiu Yanliang replied.<br>All of a sudden, a woman&rsquo;s voice interjected.<br>&ldquo;Senior Zuoqiu, you shouldn&rsquo;t say that. We&rsquo;re here to pool our strength together so as to survive this crisis.&rdquo;<br>The crowd turned their sights over, only to see a humongous white crane gliding across the air. Its size was so big that its wingspan extended for over thirty thousand meters. Despite its graceful appearance, its strength was definitely nothing to make light of.<br>It was at rank two Martial Exalted level.<br>However, the crowd was more focused on the small silhouette standing on the head of the white crane. It was an elegant woman with a fair complexion.<br>Her glowing presence made all of the other female disciples present look dull in comparison. If the others were beautiful fairies, she would be a fairy amongst the fairies. Her appearance wasn&rsquo;t the type to dazzle others at first sight, but she had an ethereal poise that seemed untouched by the vicissitudes of the mortal world. Just her disposition in itself was more than enough to attract the attention of others.<br>But of course, there was far more to her than her appearance.<br>Her name was Song Qian, and she was ranked five in the Hidden Dragon Disciples. Just like the white crane she was standing on top of, she was a rank two Martial Exalted level cultivator.<br>&ldquo;How could I possibly make light of Junior Song? In fact, I was waiting for your arrival.&rdquo;<br>Surprisingly, Zuoqiu Yanliang&rsquo;s attitude changed right away upon seeing Song Qian. If Li Muzhi and the others were all beneath him, Song Qian would at least be someone worthy of being a peer to him.<br>Song Qian came a little closer and asked, &ldquo;Senior Zuoqiu, did you notice anything amiss here?&rdquo;<br>At the eye of the black tornado, there was a huge sphere of wind. This wind gave off an extremely dangerous aura, such that no cultivators beneath Martial Exalted level could hope to pass through it. On top of that, it was impossible to see through this revolving sphere of wind with one&rsquo;s spirit power either, so no one could see what was within it from the outside.<br>If the Hellking was really awakening for its slumber, there was a good chance that it was currently inside this sphere of wind.<br>&ldquo;My guess is that the Hellking is currently inside. I&rsquo;m intending to head in to confront it. Junior Song, do you still remember the Hidden Dragon Sword Formation?&rdquo;<br>As Zuoqiu Yanliang spoke, he drew a golden sword that had the inscription of a golden dragon on its blade. This sword was a little special. It didn&rsquo;t emanate the aura of an Exalted Armament, but at the same time, it was made out of some sort of extraordinary material that hinted that it was no ordinary weapon.<br>Rather than a weapon, it felt more like a treasure.<br>&ldquo;How could I possibly forget the Hidden Dragon Sword Formation?&rdquo;<br>Song Qian also whipped out an identical golden sword too.<br>&ldquo;Senior Zuoqiu, I&rsquo;ll lend you a helping hand!&rdquo;<br>Li Muzhi also took out an identical golden sword too.<br>&ldquo;Li Muzhi, if I recall correctly, you are still unable to control the power of the Hidden Dragon Sword yet, right?&rdquo; Zuoqiu Yanliang asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m indeed unable to control it alone, but I can tap into the power of my tamed beast through my soul possession treasure to aid me in controlling it,&rdquo; Li Muzhi said as he quickly formed a series of hand seals before tossing the sword outward.<br>As the sword rose into the air, a brilliant golden light identical to that of the sword shone from Li Muzhi&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Weng!<br>The golden sword in the sky suddenly began releasing the aura of a rank nine Utmost Exalted level cultivator.<br>Whoosh!<br>The tamed beast beneath Li Muzhi&rsquo;s feet released a furious howl as its eyes turned golden too. Following that, the golden sword&rsquo;s aura rose to that of a rank two Martial Exalted level cultivator.<br>&ldquo;Not bad. If that&rsquo;s the case, you&rsquo;ll indeed be able to support me. Li Muzhi, it&rsquo;ll be a great merit for you if we manage to defeat the Hellking and stop this calamity,&rdquo; Zuoqiu Yanliang said.<br>Song Qian also quickly formed a series of hand seals and tossed the golden sword into the sky. Soon, her sword also emanated the aura of a rank two Martial Exalted level cultivator.<br>Even though both swords were at rank two Martial Exalted level, the energy that was emanating from Song Qian&rsquo;s sword clearly felt much more condensed. After all, both Song Qian and her tamed beasts were at rank two Martial Exalted level, so their combined prowess was bound to be greater.<br>&ldquo;The Duanmu Brothers, you should coordinate with the personal disciples to set up a supporting formation for us,&rdquo; Zuoqiu Yanliang instructed.<br>&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;<br>The Duanmu Brothers and the personal disciples quickly took out similar golden swords, though it was worth noting that the golden swords wielded by the personal disciples looked much cruder as compared to the ones Li Muzhi and the others had.<br>Through their coordination, it didn&rsquo;t take long for the personal disciples to set up a powerful formation. By this moment, the brilliant golden radiance had already expanded to the point where it seemed to be able to put up a fight against the black tornado.<br>Whoosh!<br>A furious roar suddenly shook the surroundings, filling all of the disciples&rsquo; eyes with fright and unease. The roar had sounded from the sphere of wind!<br></p></div>
