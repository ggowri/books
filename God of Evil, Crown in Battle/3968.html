        <div> - Change Of Expression From Mere Mention<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The strength of the six great powers&rsquo; top geniuses were actually all about the same.<br>The reason why Shentu Haoli was deemed to be the strongest among them was because she had grasped this rank nine Immortal Technique, Heaven-devouring Fire Dragon, an extremely difficult Immortal Technique to learn.<br>Heaven-devouring Fire Dragon was capable of fusing with one&rsquo;s weapon to increase its might.<br>Because of that, when Shentu Haoli used the Heaven-devouring Fire Dragon, everyone felt that the outcome of the match was decided.<br>Even though Nangong Yifan held absolute superiority over Shentu Haoli, if he was unable to take on her Heaven-devouring Fire Dragon, he would undoubtedly be defeated.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right when the fire dragon was about to reach Nangong Yifan, dark black gaseous flames rushed out from Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s body. The dark black gaseous flames took the shape of an enormous hand that was the same size as the fire dragon, and directly grabbed the fire dragon.<br>Then, the dark black gaseous flames continued to expand. In the end, an enormous towering giant of black gaseous flames stood between heaven and earth.<br>That giant was so enormous that it was many times larger than the fire dragon.<br>&ldquo;Rank nine Immortal Technique, Dark Ghostflame.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Nangong Yifan actually managed to gain mastery over that Immortal Technique?&rdquo;<br>The crowd burst into an uproar. Not to mention the outsiders, even many of the elders and disciples from the All-heaven Sect burst into an uproar.<br>As people from the All-heaven Sect, they all knew very well what level of technique the Dark Ghostflame was.<br>It was precisely because the crowd knew that it was simply too difficult to learn Dark Ghostflame that they were so astonished.<br>That being said, it had actually been some time since Nangong Yifan had managed to grasp Dark Ghostflame.<br>Back then, when he was in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Nangong Yifan had used the Dark Ghostflame in his battle against Chu Feng.<br>Unfortunately, his Dark Ghostflame had ended up being defeated by Chu Feng&rsquo;s Immortal Taboo: Blood Lightning Technique.<br>That said, the match between Nangong Yifan and Chu Feng was only known to very few people.<br>Furthermore, neither Nangong Yifan nor the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s disciples would possibly publicize Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s defeat.<br>Thus, not only did the crowd not know that Nangong Yifan had once lost to a person of the younger generation from the Ancestral Martial Starfield, but they also never knew that Nangong Yifan had actually managed to grasp the Dark Ghostflame, a very powerful Immortal Technique.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice filled with anger was heard.<br>It was Shentu Haoli&rsquo;s voice.<br>Shentu Haoli&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Fire Dragon had been crushed by Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s Dark Ghostflame. It turned into blazes that filled the sky and scattered into thin air.<br>Shentu Haoli herself was also struck by an energy ripple caused by the Dark Ghostflame.<br>At that moment, she did not even have the strength to fly anymore. She sat on the ground in pain, and had lost all her battle power.<br>She had been defeated. Merely, she found her defeat very difficult to accept.<br>&ldquo;So powerful. He&rsquo;s simply too powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Normally, since the Dark Ghostflame and Heaven-devouring Fire Dragon are on the same level as Immortal Techniques, their might should be on par with each other.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, Nangong Yifan managed to so easily defeat the Heaven-devouring Fire Dragon. This is truly a reflection of his superior battle power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To possess such overwhelming battle power at the same level of cultivation, it would appear that the strongest disciple of the six great powers will be Nangong Yifan for sure.&rdquo;<br>The people outside were discussing the fight spiritedly.<br>That said, it was not only the people outside that noticed this sight. Even the people inside the spirit formation world noticed it.<br>After all, the Dark Ghostflame and Heaven-devouring Fire Dragon were simply too eye-catching.<br>Through those two Immortal Techniques, the crowd inside the spirit formation world were able to determine who was fighting, as well as the outcome of their battle.<br>Due to the fact that the Immortal Techniques displayed by Nangong Yifan and Shentu Haoli were simply too eye-catching, the two top geniuses that were fighting far away both stopped fighting and turned their gazes towards the direction of Nangong Yifan and Shentu Haoli&rsquo;s battlefield.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that Shentu Haoli would lose to Nangong Yifan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not even Shentu Haoli is a match for Nangong Yifan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we encounter him alone, we would most definitely suffer defeat.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wu Ming, do you still think there&rsquo;s a need to continue with this battle?&rdquo;<br>The strongest younger generation of the Miao Heavenly Clan, Miao Jiutian, looked profoundly at the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion&rsquo;s strongest disciple Wu Ming, who he had been fighting earlier.<br>&ldquo;It would not be too late for us to continue after taking care of Nangong Yifan,&rdquo; said Wu Ming.<br>&ldquo;My thoughts exactly,&rdquo; said Miao Jiutian.<br>After saying those words, the two top geniuses that were fighting with their all actually smiled at each other, and reached terms.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re joining hands. Wu Ming and Miao Jiutian are actually joining hands.&rdquo;<br>Wu Ming and Miao Jiutian&rsquo;s conversation had been captured by the crowd outside.<br>At that moment, the crowd began to sigh emotionally.<br>Wu Ming and Miao Jiutian&rsquo;s decision to join hands was definitely a correct one.<br>However, their decision also indirectly reflected how powerful Nangong Yifan was.<br>Because of that, Nangong Yifan being the strongest of the six great powers&rsquo; disciples was settled even more firmly in the crowd&rsquo;s hearts.<br>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re joining hands, we should include Ouyang Pingzhi and Song Jinglun. With that, our odds of success will be a bit better,&rdquo; Wu Ming said to Miao Jiutian.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that the Wind Lightning Sword Sect and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain had some disagreements not long ago.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is most likely impossible for them to join hands.&rdquo; Miao Jiutian looked profoundly in another direction.<br>Even though they were very far away, Miao Jiutian and Wu Ming were still able to see the energy ripples being emitted by the battle far away.<br>Both of them knew that the other battle occuring far away must be between Ouyang Pingzhi and Song Jinglun.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, let us wait for the outcome of their battle. We&rsquo;ll ask the victor to join hands with us,&rdquo; said Wu Ming.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there might not be enough time for that.&rdquo; Miao Jiutian&rsquo;s expression suddenly turned ugly.<br>The reason for that was because he noticed that the enormous black figure towering between heaven and earth was walking towards them.<br>After defeating the Inferno Academy, Nangong Yifan had decided to move towards Wu Ming and Miao Jiutian.<br>&ldquo;Humph, that Nangong Yifan is truly arrogant.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, we must have him witness our abilities.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if we are to lose, we must not allow him to enjoy an easy victory.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Nangong Yifan was coming to attack them, Wu Ming did not give up. Instead, he took a meaningful glance at Miao Jiutian.<br>Miao Jiutian responded with a nod.<br>At that moment, intense battle desire filled their eyes.<br>They prepared themselves to confront Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>Meanwhile, another person fell from the battle between the disciples of the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain and the Wind Lightning Sword Sect.<br>The person who fell was the final disciple of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect apart from Ouyang Pingzhi.<br>The outcome of the battle between the Wind Lightning Sword Sect and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain had concluded.<br>The Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s disciples were capable of utilizing their Wind Lightning Swords to set up the mighty Wind Lightning Sword Formations.<br>Yet, at that moment, they had all fallen to the ground.<br>They had been defeated, The disciples from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect had all been defeated by the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s disciples.<br>The reason for that was due to the disparity in their overall battle power.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve yet to warm up, yet you&rsquo;ve all fallen already? Truly useless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Trash like you were actually shouting about teaching us a lesson? You&rsquo;re truly overestimating your abilities.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the fallen disciples from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect, the disciples of the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain all mocked and ridiculed them.<br>The Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s disciples were completely beaten. Even though they felt very unreconciled, they lowered their heads dispiritedly. No one refuted the ridicule thrown at them.<br>Even though their Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s strongest disciple, Ouyang Pingzhi, was still fighting against the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s strongest disciple Song Jinglun, he was also in a disadvantaged state.<br>Soon, he would also be defeated.<br>As such, it was meaningless for them to continue to resist.<br>They had been defeated. Furthermore, they had been completely and thoroughly defeated.<br>As such, they decided to silently endure the humiliation from the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s disciples.<br>&ldquo;It looks like senior brother Song&rsquo;s about to win too.&rdquo;<br>After insulting the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s disciples, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s disciples began to observe the battle between Song Jinglun and Ouyang Pingzhi.<br>Suddenly, a disciple of the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain asked, &ldquo;Even if senior brother Song managed to defeat that Ouyang Pingzhi, will he&hellip; be able to win against Nangong Yifan?&rdquo;<br>Once he said those words, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s disciples that were previously in high spirit's expressions immediately became gloomy.<br>Even though they had been fighting the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s disciples earlier, they were also observing the situation of the battles elsewhere.<br>As such, they all knew that Nangong Yifan had defeated Shentu Haoli, as well as the Miao Heavenly Clan and the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion potentially joining hands.<br>Even though defeating the Wind Lightning Sword Sect had greatly increased their morale, they all knew that their actual opponent was the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s Nangong Yifan.<br>However, it just so happened that Nangong Yifan had grown to become an existence that they could not contend against.<br>He was so powerful that their expressions would change from the mere mention of his name.<br></p></div>
