        <div> - Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>The speed at which Chu Feng was traveling when he left was very fast. Thus, he had no idea of the massacre that had happened after he left.<br>That said, although Chu Feng had left, he didn&rsquo;t really travel far. He merely wanted to distance himself from that group of people and find a quiet place.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng landed beside a lake.<br>&ldquo;M-M-Milord, w-what do you w-want this lowly one to h-help you with? W-What could I p-possibly h-help you w-with, given h-how weak I am?&rdquo;<br>Song Xi was still stuttering. Even his body was trembling nonstop. It could be seen that he was truly afraid of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared. I will not harm you. I merely wish to ask some things of you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Song Xi felt a lot more at ease upon hearing what Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Where is this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;This is the Freshwater Lake,&rdquo; Songxi said as he looked to the lake before them.<br>Chu Feng smiled, &ldquo;My mistake. My question was not clear. I meant to ask: what is the name of this world?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This world&hellip; is naturally the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,&rdquo; Song Xi said.<br>&ldquo;Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm? You said that this is the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm?&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed a shocked expression upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;This place is naturally the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Milord, could it be&hellip; that you&rsquo;re not from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm?&rdquo; Song Xi was also very surprised.<br>Chu Feng was surprised at the fact that he had actually managed to enter the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, of all places.<br>As for Song Xi, he was surprised that there was actually someone that didn&rsquo;t know this place was the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>&ldquo;I am indeed not from here. Have you heard of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm? I have heard of it before. It is one of the many Ordinary Realms under the administration of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord&hellip; you couldn&rsquo;t possibly have come from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, right?&rdquo; Thinking of this, Song Xi opened his mouth wide in shock.<br>In the eyes of the people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the people from the Ordinary Realms were all weaklings. They were existences akin to trash.<br>Even someone like Song Xi, a person standing at the bottom of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s hierarchy, looked down on the people from the Ordinary Realms.<br>This was a sort of regional discrimination. It was akin to how the great majority of people looked down on beggars, and felt themselves to be superior to them because they were better off.<br>This was human nature.<br>However, if Chu Feng really was from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, Chu Feng would be more than sufficient to topple the understanding Song Xi had toward the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>After all, Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength was much superior to Song Xi&rsquo;s.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! There are actually experts as powerful as you in the Ordinary Realms?&rdquo; Song Xi gasped with admiration.<br>However, Song Xi&rsquo;s expression soon changed enormously.<br>He suddenly recalled that someone had once mentioned to him that the people from the Upper Realms were not allowed to enter the Ordinary Realms, whereas the people from the Ordinary Realms would need certain qualification to enter the Upper Realms.<br>As for this qualification, it was that they must have a True Immortal level of cultivation.<br>&ldquo;Milord, could it be that y-y-you&rsquo;re a True Immortal-level expert?&rdquo; Upon recalling that, Song Xi&rsquo;s eyes started to shine.<br>Although there were countless True Immortal-level experts in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, it remained that people like Song Xi had never spoken with a True Immortal-level expert before.<br>In other words, no matter how weak a True Immortal-level expert might be, they would definitely not look people like Song Xi in the eyes.<br>Thus, to people like Song Xi, True Immortal-level experts were existences high above him. They were divine beings that he could not even touch.<br>&ldquo;I have only just become a True Immortal. I am still only a rank one True Immortal,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s still very amazing. Judging from your appearance, you are much younger than me,&rdquo; Song Xi was extremely excited. After verifying that Chu Feng was a True Immortal, Song Xi instead became less scared of Chu Feng.<br>The reason for that was because he had never encountered such an amiable True Immortal like Chu Feng before. This subconsciously made him think that Chu Feng was definitely not a bad person.<br>&ldquo;Song Xi, do you know where the Stairway to Heaven from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm is located?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I do. I know that,&rdquo; Song Xi nodded his head repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;Are you able to bring me there? I can compensate you for it,&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Since Chu Feng had arrived in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, what he wanted to do the most would naturally be to find Wang Qiang and the others.<br>Thus, he must proceed there as quickly as possible. He must find Wang Qiang and the others as soon as possible.<br>However, Chu Feng had no idea that after he was sucked into the light vortex, Wang Qiang and the others also suffered the same fate.<br>Not a single one of them had successfully arrived at the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm through normal means. The whereabouts of Wang Qiang, Zhao Hong, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi were all unknown.<br>&ldquo;Of course. However, you don&rsquo;t have to compensate me at all,&rdquo; Song Xi felt extremely honored when saying those words.<br>He felt that it was truly an honor for someone like him to be of use to a True Immortal-level expert.<br>Then, Chu Feng had Song Xi lead the way for him, and began to proceed directly toward the Stairway to Heaven from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>It was not a close journey at all. Fortunately, there was a teleportation formation capable of directly leading them there in the vicinity.<br>Furthermore, the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s teleportation formation was much stronger than the Hundred Refinement Ordinary Realm&rsquo;s teleportation formations.<br>Thus, the speed at which Chu Feng was teleported was extremely fast. This greatly decreased the amount of time it required for Chu Feng and Song Xi to reach their destination.<br>On their way there, Chu Feng chatted with Song Xi the entire time. Through their conversation, Chu Feng gained a rough understanding of the general state of affairs in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>As expected, the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was an extremely vast world. Its size was over a thousand times that of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>Had it not been for the fact that teleportation formations were scattered all over the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, it would be very difficult for even the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s experts to travel about.<br>One thing worthy of mentioning was that half of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was under the control of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>To the people of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the territory of the Chu Heavenly Clan could be said to be restricted areas. Practically no one dared to set foot onto them.<br>In other words, apart from the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan, the other people from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were only able to move about in half of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>This also served to display how oppressive the Chu Heavenly Clan was, as well as how high of a status they held.<br>From the things Song Xi told him, Chu Feng was able to sense that the reverence Song Xi held toward the Chu Heavenly Clan was simply akin to that of humans toward gods. It was the sort of reverence from the bottom of one&rsquo;s heart. He was most definitely not pretending.<br>&ldquo;It seems that your clan has managed this land very well. Practically no one dares to disobey them. They are truly the overlord of this realm,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said with a beaming smile on her face.<br>&ldquo;That is not my clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng corrected Eggy. Immediately afterward, he added, &ldquo;However, I must admit that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s means of doing things is quite superb.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, for them to possess this sort of means is not good for you,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;Even if they possess this much power and the means of control, I will, one day, still have their clan chief stand before father and I and apologize to us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is not only their clan chief. I will have all those that struck us father and son when we were down back then, apologize to us in unison,&rdquo; Chu Feng was extremely serious when saying these words.<br>Even though Chu Feng was merely an infant when all of that had happened, and he did not remember anything at all, he was able to picture the situation back then from the narration his father gave. Furthermore, he was able to sense the humiliation he and his father had received back then.<br>He must remove that humiliation.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha, if the people from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm are to hear what you said, they will definitely think you&rsquo;re crazy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it is precisely your confidence that this Queen is fond of,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Song Xi, apart from the Chu Heavenly Clan, what other major powers are there in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to ask Song Xi.<br>&ldquo;There are a lot of powers in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. However, if we disregard the Chu Heavenly Clan, then there are only four powers that could be said to be truly powerful,&rdquo; Song Xi said.<br>&ldquo;Which four?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The Starfall Holy Land.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Paradise Valley.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Dao Imperial Palace.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And Ghost Sect Hall.&rdquo;<br><br><br></p></div>
