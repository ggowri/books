        <div> - Facing It Personally<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Why am I cursing you out?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man has exhausted a great amount of effort to cultivate you. It took you over four hundred years to become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for that brat Chu Feng, he&rsquo;s not even a hundred years old, but he's already become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet you&rsquo;re asking me why I&rsquo;m cursing you out?&rdquo;<br>The more Grandmaster Tang Chen spoke, the more furious he became. He seemed like he wanted to give Yuan Shu two ruthless slaps to his face.<br>After all, he had nurtured Yuan Shu for the purpose of his gamble with the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>However, from the way it looked, his disciple Yuan Shu had already lost to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s disciple Chu Feng in terms of talent alone.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques increased again?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The speed of his increase is simply too fast.&rdquo;<br>Yuan Shu also felt very surprised upon hearing his master&rsquo;s words.<br>Although he was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, he did not possess observation techniques of his master&rsquo;s caliber. As such, he had no idea that Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques had already reached Dragon Mark Saint-cloak.<br>That said, Yuan Shu revealed a look of joy upon learning that Chu Feng had become a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>&ldquo;That kid Chu Feng has a treasure on him. If he had tried to intentionally conceal his strength, this old man would also not have been able to detect his world spiritist level.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, he did not deliberately conceal his strength when he was talking with you. Because of that, this old man was able to detect that his spirit power had already reached Dragon Mark Saint-cloak,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng is truly amazing. That talent of his is simply unprecedented.&rdquo; Yuan Shu became even more excited upon hearing his master&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;Look at your useless self. He is your rival. Why are you acting so happy at his outstanding performance?&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen glared fiercely at Yuan Shu after seeing how happy he was.<br>&ldquo;Hehe. Master, you and Senior Ox-nose are close friends.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only natural that I should become close friends with brother Chu Feng. Since we&rsquo;re friends, shouldn&rsquo;t I feel happy for his outstanding performance?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you want me to feel envious of him and detest him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I, Yuan Shu, were someone like that, wouldn&rsquo;t I have failed to live up to master&rsquo;s nurturing?&rdquo; Yuan Shu spoke with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Humph. This old man doesn't care what your character might be. I only hope that you can become a talented individual.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man has finished preparing for your closed-door training.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once Chu Feng leaves, you are to enter closed-door training,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;So soon?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Yuan Shu, who had been excited earlier, immediately started panicking.<br>After all, his master had told him that he would not be allowed to exit his closed-door training unless he succeeded.<br>Because of that, Yuan Shu felt enormous pressure for the closed-door training this time around.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been over a hundred years since you became a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist. If you still cannot grasp the Dragon Transformation Sensation, you&rsquo;ll be nothing more than a cripple, understand?&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;I understand. This disciple will definitely not disappoint you, master.&rdquo;<br>Yuan Shu had a serious expression on his face as he vowed with determination.<br>Had it been before, Grandmaster Tang Chen would definitely feel gratified to see Yuan Shu acting like that.<br>However, it was different at that moment. Grandmaster Tang Chen did not bother to pay any attention to Yuan Shu, and instead closed his eyes. He seemed to have seen something astonishing.<br>&ldquo;That kid actually managed to comprehend it so quickly?!&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;Master, has it begun?&rdquo;<br>Yuan Shu realized that Chu Feng must&rsquo;ve begun breaching the spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Master, I beg of you, please let me have a look too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This disciple will even kneel to master.&rdquo;<br>Yuan Shu was not one to joke around. He actually really knelt before Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>Even though Yuan Shu was seen to be a very high and mighty individual in the eyes of others, especially in the Reincarnation Upper Realm where the people viewed him as the person standing at the apex of world spirit techniques, someone who refused to give face to even the Red-dress Holy Land, he was akin to a child before his master Tang Chen.<br>He was pure and free, and would act however he wanted to without any worry for the consequences.<br>&ldquo;Look at yourself. Utter disappointment.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen glared fiercely at his disciple.<br>The more he saw how outstanding Chu Feng was, the more disgusted he was with how worthless his own disciple was.<br>&ldquo;Master, I beg of you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will definitely do my best with training this time around. I will definitely not disappoint you.&rdquo;<br>Even though Yuan Shu was over five hundred years old, his mouth was actually trembling at that moment. It was as though, if Grandmaster Tang Chen didn&rsquo;t agree to let him watch, he would start crying.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen sighed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s truly nothing I can do with you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But sure, that&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ll let you have a look at your master&rsquo;s spirit formation.&rdquo;<br>Even though Grandmaster Tang Chen spoke with reluctance, he had actually planned to let Yuan Shu watch from the very start.<br>After all, his spirit formation was no ordinary spirit formation.<br>He was intensely proud of his work. Naturally, he wanted others to evaluate it too. Otherwise, wouldn&rsquo;t he have wasted all those years of effort that he'd put into setting up the spirit formation?<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen waved his sleeve, and the enormous spirit formation gate started trembling violently.<br>Then, the boundless spirit power began to change. The spiraling spirit power started stabilizing.<br>Then, the spirit power became tranquil like water.<br>The spirit power had formed a mirror-like surface on the enormous spirit formation gate. Through the mirror, one could see Chu Feng&rsquo;s silhouette.<br>It was not only Chu Feng&rsquo;s silhouette. His surroundings; that magnificent world, was also illuminated with clarity.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Rumbles sounded from the spirit formation gate.<br>It turned out that the spirit formation gate was not only able to illuminate Chu Feng&rsquo;s silhouette, but it was even able to reproduce the sounds from Chu Feng&rsquo;s location.<br>In fact, Yuan Shu was even able to sense the aura within the spirit formation world.<br>Yuan Shu was able to clearly feel everything in the world Chu Feng was in. It was as if he were in there himself.<br>Chu Feng sat cross-legged on a vast prairie.<br>However, his surroundings were no longer serene.<br>The earth had begun trembling violently. Mountains were crumbling. Forests were disappearing and dust rose into the air everywhere. Countless giant cracks had begun swallowing everything on the surface above.<br>However, no matter what was happening around him, Chu Feng remained steady like Mount Tai. He did not move in the slightest.<br>After the earth he was on caved in, his body started floating in midair.<br>He still sat cross-legged with his eyes closed. He was still calm and composed.<br>It was as if the things happening around him had nothing to do with him.<br>&ldquo;Master, why would there be such a change?&rdquo; asked Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;This is what Chu Feng managed to comprehend.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The greater the disturbance, the higher his comprehension ability is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That child&rsquo;s comprehension ability seems to have reached the pinnacle. Otherwise, there wouldn&rsquo;t be such an enormous disturbance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That old fool Ox-nose has some fierce eyes. He actually managed to find a person of the younger generation with such talent.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s gaze had changed. He gasped repeatedly in admiration.<br>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that brother Chu Feng has passed the test?&rdquo; asked Yuan Shu.<br>&ldquo;Passed?&rdquo;<br>Hearing that word, Grandmaster Tang Chen, who had been praising Chu Feng nonstop, snorted disdainfully.<br>&ldquo;This is only the beginning. That child won&rsquo;t be able to breach this spirit formation of mine,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br></p></div>
