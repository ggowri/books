        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Invitation Letter<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Grandfather, why are you asking that? The Xu Heavenly Clan is the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s subsidiary power, and I&rsquo;ve heard that Miss Tantai Xing&rsquo;er has invited a lot of people. Thus, the Xu Heavenly Clan would naturally be there too,&rdquo; Gong Mingyue said.<br>&ldquo;I merely wanted to advise you to keep your distance from that Xu Morong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, you are someone with a fiance,&rdquo; said the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Grandfather, you have also witnessed what sort of trash that Chu Feng is. Do you still plan to push me into a pit of fire even now?&rdquo; Gong Mingyue asked.<br>&ldquo;The marriage has already been decided. You should recognize it,&rdquo; The Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s tone was no longer as unyielding as before. Instead, it had became one with a slight tone of persuasion.<br>&ldquo;Forget about it. Grandfather, if you really think that Chu Feng is a talent, why didn&rsquo;t you act to save him earlier?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truthfully, after you saw his true ability, you started to feel disgust toward him from the bottom of your heart, no? Gong Mingyue said.<br>&ldquo;What utter nonsense!&rdquo; The Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief revealed an angry look.<br>Gong Mingyue was not afraid of her grandfather. She continued, &ldquo;Grandfather, don&rsquo;t you act so reluctant to admit your mistake. I have grown up by your side and know you very well. I know that you&rsquo;re someone who cares a lot about your face. However, I also know that you care about me even more. You will not really push me into a pit of fire for the sake of your so-called face.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I can tell that you seem to also know that Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Rather than feeling tangled here and pondering whether or not to have me marry that Chu Feng, why don&rsquo;t you go and have a chat with that Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and ask him to set up a wedding engagement with that Wuma Shengjie?&rdquo; said Gong Mingyue.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>Gong Mingyue&rsquo;s words greatly alarmed the crowd. They all felt it to be unimaginable.<br>As for the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, he stood there completely stunned.<br>One must know that Gong Mingyue had always been a very conceited and proud person her entire life.<br>Even though that Xu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Xu Morong had pursued her for many years, Gong Mingyue still rejected him.<br>She was truly a snow lotus growing on top of an ice mountain, a saintess in the hearts of the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations. She was completely inviolable and untainted by dust.<br>Yet, she actually said such a thing. How could the crowd not be astonished?<br>It turned out that it wasn&rsquo;t that Gong Mingyue was untainted by dust, it wasn&rsquo;t that she was uninterested in men. It was merely that she possessed too high of a requirement for her future husband.<br>Otherwise, she wouldn&rsquo;t possibly be tempted after seeing Wuma Shengjie, and even go as far as to say such a thing of her own accord.<br>After Gong Mingyue finished saying those words, ignoring the reaction of the crowd, she directly turned around and left, flying in the direction of the Tantai Heavenly Clan. The Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations followed her.<br>At that moment, only the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and some elders of the Gong Heavenly Clan remained.<br>At that moment, the elders did not dare to say anything.<br>They felt that their Lord Clan Chief must be feeling very displeased after being contradicted by Gong Mingyue in such a manner. As such, they did not dare to provoke him at such a time.<br>&ldquo;Wuma Shengjie?&rdquo; Suddenly, the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s name. Then, he began contemplating.<br>At that moment, the Gong Heavenly Clansmen left looked at one another. Joyful expressions appeared in their eyes.<br>They all knew that if their young miss Gong MIngyue was to marry Chu Feng, it would definitely be much worse than marrying Wuma Shengjie.<br>With Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s talent, even if he could not compare to Linghu Hongfei, his future prospects would still be absolutely incalculable.<br>The reason why the felt so joyous was because they knew that Gong Mingyue&rsquo;s words had caused their Lord Clan Chief to ponder the matter.<br>&hellip;...<br>Meanwhile, while bringing Chu Feng and the others with him, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was flying rapidly toward the Ice Summit.<br>The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had learned that Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was sealed, and that he needed to proceed to the Ice Summit to seek out Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others for assistance. Thus, the speed at which they were traveling was very fast.<br>Chu Feng also learned from Wuma Shengjie that Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others had not left the Ice Summit at all. They'd merely spread the news that they&rsquo;d left to fool others so that the crowd around the Ice Summit would scatter.<br>The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did not ask Chu Feng how the Xu Heavenly Clansmen encountered him, and why they decided to create trouble for him. After all, he knew how the friction between Chu Feng and the Xu Heavenly Clan came about.<br>That said, both the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Wuma Shengjie were very curious as to where Chu Feng had gone.<br>Chu Feng did not attempt to conceal the matter, and began to tell them what he had experienced.<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng learned that some things had happened during the period when he was unconscious.<br>All of the people from the younger generation on the Ice Summit suffered from a backlash. Even Grandmaster Liangqiu and the other Saint-cloak World Spiritists were no exception.<br>This made it so that the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars had to be postponed.<br>After all, if all of the most powerful competitors for the Ancestral Martial Decastars were unable to participate in it, the selection would become completely meaningless.<br>Of course, it was not announced that the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars was delayed because all of the younger generations had received a backlash.<br>That sort of thing naturally could not be announced. As such, a random reason was found to justify the delay.<br>After learning about this matter, Chu Feng felt joyous.<br>Earlier, when the Xu Heavenly Clansmen were attacking Chu Chengkong, they mentioned the specific date of the conflict that had occurred between their Xu Heavenly Clan and the Chu Heavenly Clan. Because of that, Chu Feng knew that the date for the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars had passed.<br>Chu Feng had originally felt somewhat disappointed at missing out on it. However, it turned out that the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars had not occurred at all. Instead, it had been postponed.<br>In other words, as long as Chu Feng could remove the effect of his backlash, he would still be able to participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars.<br>He would still have an opportunity to prove himself.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are truly too amazing. As expected of Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;<br>Hearing the discussions between Chu Feng, Wuma Shengjie and the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Chu Chengkong looked to Chu Feng in a very joyous manner. He became so excited that his eyes started to moisten.<br>Chu Chengkong was sent to the Nine Dragons Upper Realm to carry out a mission right after Chu Feng returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan. Thus, he had no knowledge of the things that had happened afterwards. His impression of Chu Feng still remained at that of the day when Chu Feng climbed the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps.<br>At that moment, he learned that Chu Feng was actually the crucial existence in the breaching of the Ice Summit&rsquo;s grand formation. He was actually the person wearing the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak that had appeared on the Ice Summit several days before.<br>As a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan, as Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s friend, he felt joy and pride for Chu Feng from the bottom of his heart.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so excited just yet. The selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars is the actual place for young friend Chu Feng to shine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All the people that laughed at young friend Chu Feng today will learn how foolish their mockery toward him was,&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said to Chu Chengkong.<br>&ldquo;Of course. I truly can&rsquo;t wait to see their expressions of regret,&rdquo; Chu Chengkong said.<br>Seeing the two seniors discussing him like two children, Chu Feng smiled.<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right, Chu Feng, this is for you,&rdquo; Suddenly, Wuma Shengjie handed an invitation card to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Who is this from?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Tantai Xing&rsquo;er. She is holding a gathering of the younger generations. No, to be exact, she is holding a gathering of the younger generations for you,&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie said.<br></p></div>
