        <div> - Disparity In Battle Power<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;<br>Furious, Zuoqiu Daoyi shouted at Chu Feng, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go ahead and tell me exactly what sort of ability that was?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why be secretive?! How are you a man acting like that?!&rdquo;<br>He felt that Chu Feng was lying to him.<br>Even if a rank one Exalted Taboo could take on a rank two or rank three Exalted Taboo, he felt that it would be impossible for a rank one Exalted Taboo to take on his rank four Exalted Taboo.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng chuckled. He said, &ldquo;You still don&rsquo;t understand?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What are you implying?&rdquo; asked Zuoqiu Daoyi.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know soon.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng said those words, lightning clouds appeared in the sky.<br>In the lightning clouds that filled the sky were countless blood-red lightning bolts, galloping and roaring about.<br>The crowd had all witnessed this attack before.<br>That was the Immortal Taboo Martial Skill Chu Feng had used before, Immortal Taboo: Blood Lightning Technique.<br>Chu Feng had used this Immortal Taboo to take on Zuoqiu Daoyi&rsquo;s rank one Exalted Taboo.<br>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Daoyi narrowed his brows. He was completely puzzled by Chu Feng.<br>He was truly confused as to what his goal in doing this was.<br>&ldquo;Truth is, even if I didn&rsquo;t use a rank one Exalted Taboo against you earlier, even if I only used an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill, I&rsquo;d still be able to destroy your rank four Exalted Taboo,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Bullshit!&rdquo; Zuoqiu Daoyi cursed furiously.<br>He felt that Chu Feng was insulting him.<br>No matter how ineffective his rank four Exalted Taboo might be, it was definitely not something that an Immortal Taboo could take on.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, a blood-red lightning bolt struck down from above, right before Zuoqiu Daoyi.<br>Even though the lightning only landed before him and did not actually strike him, the energy ripples created by the blood-red lightning sent Zuoqiu Daoyi flying.<br>When he landed, Zuoqiu Daoyi was actually completely covered in injuries.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen&rsquo;s complexions changed color upon witnessing this scene.<br>Chu Feng had used that Immortal Taboo Martial Skill earlier.<br>Even though it possessed impressive power, Zuoqiu Daoyi was able to dodge it the entire time.<br>However, the lightning that struck earlier was not only so fast that Zuoqiu Daoyi failed to evade it, but it was also astonishingly powerful.<br>Evidently, the power of Chu Feng&rsquo;s Immortal Taboo had increased tremendously.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, what&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo;<br>In a panic, all the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen turned to their clan chief.<br>Faced with the crowd&rsquo;s gazes, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief narrowed his brows and did not reply.<br>Even he had no idea as to exactly what was happening.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, countless more lightning bolts struck down from the sky.<br>After the lightning struck, it did not disappear immediately. Instead, it began to draw closer to Zuoqiu Daoyi.<br>Most importantly, the lightning bolts that struck down were simply too numerous. They formed a net that surrounded Zuoqiu Daoyi.<br>Seeing the lightning growing closer and closer to him, Zuoqiu Daoyi immediately brandished his Incomplete Exalted Armament and unleashed his rank two Exalted Taboo to cut through the entrapment.<br>However, shockingly, his rank two Exalted Taboo was actually incapable of defeating the blood-red lightning.<br>With that, Zuoqiu Daoyi unleashed his rank three Exalted Taboo.<br>Yet, not even his rank three Exalted Taboo was able to defeat the incoming lightning.<br>&ldquo;This guy, he couldn&rsquo;t possibly really be able to take on young master Daoyi&rsquo;s rank four Exalted Taboo using an Immortal Taboo, right?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that not even a rank three Exalted Taboo was able to beat back Chu Feng&rsquo;s blood-red lightning, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen began to feel doubt.<br>They&rsquo;d felt it to be unimaginable that an Immortal Taboo was able to take on a rank one Exalted Taboo.<br>However, after they witnessed that same Immortal Taboo taking on even a rank three Exalted Taboo and defeating it, they were truly terrified.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! I&rsquo;ll see exactly how you&rsquo;ll take on my rank four Exalted Taboo!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, cyan flames soared into the sky.<br>With no alternative, Zuoqiu Daoyi ended up using his rank four Exalted Taboo again.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>After the cyan flames surged forth, the blood-red lighting suddenly accelerated, and arrived before Zuoqiu Daoyi in an instant.<br>The blood-red lightning collided with the cyan flames and immediately sparked a boundless amount of energy ripples.<br>In the blink of an eye, the cyan flames and the blood-red lightning covered the entire Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation.<br>When the energy ripples dissipated, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were completely stunned.<br>Zuoqiu Daoyi was not only lying on the ground, his entire body was also charred black. He was covered in serious injuries and lacked the strength to even stand back up.<br>As for Chu Feng, he was completely unscathed.<br>Chu Feng actually managed to defeat a rank four Exalted Taboo using an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill.<br>At this moment, silence filled the entire area.<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were all stupefied with blank eyes.<br>Even though they knew that there was a certain amount of disparity between their young master Daoyi and that youngster by the name of Chu Feng, they&rsquo;d never imagined that disparity to be so great.<br>Through using their various abilities, the two men both had a cultivation of rank four Utmost Exalted.<br>Yet, Chu Feng actually managed to defeat their young master Daoyi&rsquo;s rank four Exalted Taboo with an Immortal Taboo. The disparity was simply so immense that they found themselves incapable of accepting it.<br>Finally, Chu Feng spoke. His tone was filled with contempt for Zuoqiu Daoyi. &ldquo;Do you understand now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why I&rsquo;m able to defeat you has nothing to do with how exceptionally powerful my martial skills were. Instead, it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re too weak.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although both of our cultivations have increased to rank four Utmost Exalted, our battle powers are on completely different levels.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The disparity between our battle powers is simply too great. It&rsquo;s practically equivalent to the disparity between a single level of cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With such an enormous disparity, no matter how powerful of a martial skill you use, it&rsquo;ll all be useless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bullshit! You&rsquo;re either carrying a treasure with you or you&rsquo;re concealing your actual cultivation!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I admit that you&rsquo;ve won, but was there really a need to conceal your strength to humiliate me?!&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Daoyi did not believe Chu Feng, and cursed at him angrily.<br>Truth was, he was incapable of accepting Chu Feng&rsquo;s claims as true. He was unable to accept that there was so enormous of a disparity between their battle powers.<br>After all, he was a genius. Very few people were able to contend against him under the same cultivation.<br>He had considered his battle power to be at the apex of his cultivation.<br>If his battle power was already at the apex, how could there be such a massive disparity between his battle power and Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power?<br>In fact, he was not the only one that didn&rsquo;t believe Chu Feng&rsquo;s claims. The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen also didn&rsquo;t believe Chu Feng.<br>However, in the clouds above, the old man and girl from the Dragon Clan revealed looks of certainty.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that while the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s two geniuses were talented, they&rsquo;ve relied on a lot of treasures to gain their current cultivations. Because of that, their cultivations are unstable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, that Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation is extremely sturdy. On top of that, his battle power is astonishing to begin with. That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s such a vast disparity between the two of them,&rdquo; said the old man.<br>&ldquo;But, it seems like the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation&rsquo;s power is about to disappear.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What is he going to do then?&rdquo; said the girl.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng waved his sleeve and sent forth his oppressive might.<br>Then, Zuoqiu Daoyi and his brother Zuoqiu Tiancheng found themselves restricted by Chu Feng&rsquo;s oppressive might and strung into the air.<br>The swords held by the two brothers were being controlled by Chu Feng too.<br>At this moment, the two swords were aimed at the two brothers.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what are you trying to do?!&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Hanxun and many other Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen immediately shouted loudly upon seeing that.<br>Their threats were sounding nonstop.<br>They were afraid. They feared that Chu Feng would kill their two genius young masters.<br>However, Chu Feng paid no attention to them. Instead, he turned to the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Only one of your two sons can live. You determine who,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
