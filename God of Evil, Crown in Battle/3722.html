        <div> - Begin Immediately<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon calming down, Chu Lingxi not only confirmed that her eyes were capable of seeing, but she also discovered something else.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really not blind?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My eyes&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wait! My cultivation, it changed?!!!&rdquo; said Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Your cultivation?&rdquo;<br>No one had taken note of Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s cultivation because they were too worried about her.<br>It was only after Chu Lingxi said those words that the crowd began to take note of her cultivation.<br>It was only then that they discovered that Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s cultivation was no longer that of a rank three Exalted. Instead, she had become a rank four Exalted.<br>Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s cultivation had actually increased.<br>But, Chu Lingxi was a Heavenly Bloodline possessor. Shouldn&rsquo;t she create an abnormal sign when her cultivation increased?<br>How come there wasn&rsquo;t an abnormal sign this time around? How come her cultivation increased just like that?<br>It&rsquo;s the Deepsea Pupils!!!<br>This was the first thing that came to the crowd&rsquo;s minds.<br>Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s cultivation wouldn&rsquo;t have increased for no reason. If one must find a reason, it would definitely be the Deepsea Pupils.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my eyes. My eyes seem to be very special.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am able to sense that it&rsquo;s my eyes that caused this change.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Lingxi spoke, she released her spirit power and formed a mirror.<br>Seeing herself in the mirror, Chu Lingxi stood stunned. She remained stunned for a very long time before saying excitedly, &ldquo;Heavens, my eyes, they&rsquo;re beautiful. My eyes&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mother, what is going on with my eyes?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, where are we?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked excitedly.<br>Chu Feng and the others briefly explained what had happened to her.<br>Of course, they only told her that they werehere to retrieve the Deepsea Pupils, and did not mention the various dangers they had encountered in the process.<br>&ldquo;This is the legendary Mirror Sea?&rdquo;<br>Even though no one had mentioned how dangerous that place was, Chu Lingxi revealed a look of guilt after realizing that they were at the Mirror Sea.<br>&ldquo;I am truly sorry. It&rsquo;s all because of my stubbornness and insisting on challenging Linghu Hongfei.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, everyone wouldn&rsquo;t have to take on such a risk to help me treat my eyes.&rdquo; Chu Lingxi felt very remorseful.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with you challenging Linghu Hongfei. The one that&rsquo;s wrong is Linghu Hongfei.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Regarding that matter, your mother will uphold justice for you. I will definitely make the Linghu Heavenly Clan provide an explanation.&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan pledged to Chu Lingxi with certainty.<br>&ldquo;I want to personally avenge myself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I merely&hellip; do not want everyone to take on such risks because of me. After all, I am the one who caused this disaster, thus I should be the one to shoulder the consequences.&rdquo; said Chu Lingxi.<br>Chu Lingxi was very intelligent. Thus, even though they were all avoiding the subject of how difficult the journey to the Mirror Sea and obtaining the Deepsea Pupils was, Chu Lingxi was able to guess it to some extent.<br>She knew that the process of obtaining the Deepsea Pupils was most definitely filled with difficulties. She felt that this was especially so for Chu Feng, as he still looked extremely weak from using the first slash of the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes.<br>Because of that, Chu Lingxi felt very ashamed.<br>Even though she had clearly challenged Linghu Hongfei to stand up for Chu Feng, she never expected that she would ultimately need to trouble him to help her.<br>This was completely different from what she had expected.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, that&rsquo;s enough. Let us not talk about the things from the past. Since you&rsquo;ve fought Linghu Hongfei, do you know how powerful he currently is?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;When I fought him, he had the same cultivation of rank three Exalted like me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I kept having a feeling that he had not used his full strength against me. He must be hiding something.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But now, I am a rank four Exalted, and my eyes have increased my battle power a lot. If I am to fight him again, the outcome of the battle will not be certain.&rdquo;<br>As she said those words, Chu Lingxi had a look of confidence on her face.<br>It would appear that the Deepsea Pupils had truly assisted her greatly.<br>&ldquo;If that is all, I&rsquo;m afraid that it would still not be enough. I have a gift that I&rsquo;m going to give you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Gift?&rdquo;<br>The crowd&rsquo;s gazes all changed upon hearing those words.<br>However, to the crowd&rsquo;s surprise, Chu Feng turned his gaze to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Cough, cough&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Faced with the crowd&rsquo;s confused gazes, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist coughed in a very pleased manner before saying, &ldquo;Young lady, you are truly fortunate in making such a good friend.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whilst this old man doesn&rsquo;t know how Chu Feng obtained the Deepsea Pupils for you, he paid quite considerably in order to give you this gift.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, the price that he paid could be said to be worth it. This is the gift.&rdquo;<br>As the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke, he flipped his palm and took out a bead containing Divine Power.<br>Upon seeing the bead, black lines immediately rolled down Gu Mingyuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s heads.<br>They already knew what the gift was. It would definitely be assisting Chu Lingxi in fusing with a Divine Power.<br>Firmly determined that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was a swindler, Gu Mingyuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu would definitely not think that gift to be something good.<br>&ldquo;Wow. This aura, could it be&hellip; Divine Power?&rdquo;<br>Compared to Gu Mingyuan and Grandmaster Liangqiu, Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s eyes started shining. She became deeply interested in the bead before her.<br>&ldquo;It is indeed Divine Power. Young lady, this old man knows that flowing within your body are two kinds of bloodline power. One is your father&rsquo;s Heavenly Bloodline, and the other is your mother&rsquo;s Ancient Clan&rsquo;s bloodline.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, as long as you are willing to bear hardships and put forth effort, you will have the chance to obtain a third type of power -- Divine Power.&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Senior, is that really the case?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi was immediately overjoyed upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;Of course. However&hellip; you must properly thank Chu Feng for this. This old man will not randomly help others with this sort of thing. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Chu Feng seeking my help, even if your father and mother wanted my help, I would not have helped you.&rdquo; said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are simply too good to me.&rdquo;<br>Overwhelmed with excitement, Chu Lingxi actually leapt into Chu Feng&rsquo;s bosom and hugged him tightly.<br>Although she hugged him tightly, she only hugged him momentarily before turning around to look to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. &ldquo;Senior, when do we begin then?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That will be up to you. When do you want to begin?&rdquo; asked the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;If possible, I wish to begin immediately.&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Very well, we&rsquo;ll begin immediately then. The two of you can go rest first, this old man will make some preparations. Once my preparations are done, I will immediately call for you.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist waved his sleeve.<br>A vast amount of spirit power was released from his sleeve, filling the sky.<br>After the spirit power swept through the sky, it formed an enormous palace.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist stepped into that palace. He seemed to really be off to make some sort of preparations.<br></p></div>
