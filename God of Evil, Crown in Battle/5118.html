        <div>: Grandma&rsquo;s Servant<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Little young master?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart jolted. He quickly stepped forward and supported Lord Yuwei back up.<br>&ldquo;Elder, do you know my grandfather?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>If Lord Yuwei served his father, she would have addressed him as &lsquo;young master&rsquo;. The fact that she was addressing him as &lsquo;little young master&rsquo; suggested that she was serving his grandfather instead.<br>&ldquo;I have heard of your grandfather, but I&rsquo;ve never met him before,&rdquo; Lord Yuwei replied.<br>&ldquo;You have never met my grandfather before?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was surprised to hear that.<br>However, he quickly came to a realization and asked, &ldquo;Elder, do you know my grandmother?&rdquo;<br>Lord Yuwei revealed a benevolent smile upon hearing that question, replying, &ldquo;Yes, your grandmother is the young miss I serve.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Elder, do you know what my grandmother encountered back then? Have you heard any news about my grandfather&rsquo;s whereabouts?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He believed that the mysterious granny he had previously met had a good chance of being his grandmother, but the granny was hardly in a good state at all. Furthermore, his father was emanating a strong blood stench when he was delivered to the Chu Heavenly Clan back then, suggesting that something must have happened back then.<br>&ldquo;You know that a mishap has happened to your grandmother?&rdquo;<br>Lord Yuwei looked at Chu Feng in surprise. Her reaction verified Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess.<br>&ldquo;Elder, please tell me what happened back then,&rdquo; he asked.<br>After all, this was something concerning his grandmother and grandfather.<br>Lord Yuwei began recounting the events that had transpired back then.<br>Lord Yuwei was born in the Totem Galaxy as an orphan. Once, she encountered danger and was saved by the Golden Dragon Flame Sect, and the sect eventually took her in as a maid. Due to her outstanding performance, she was entrusted with the important responsibility of taking care of the sectmaster&rsquo;s newborn daughter.<br>The sectmaster&rsquo;s newborn daughter was none other than Song Luoyi.<br>Song Luoyi&rsquo;s mother passed away shortly after she was born, so one could say that she was raised by Lord Yuwei. The two of them were on extremely close terms, to the point that they shared all secrets with each other.<br>Back then, Song Luoyi was known to be the most talented junior and the most beautiful woman in the starfield she was located in. Many prodigies admired her, and countless knocked on the Golden Dragon Flame Sect&rsquo;s door to ask for her hand in marriage.<br>All of them were rejected because none of them caught Song Luoyi&rsquo;s eyes, so everyone naturally came to think that she was focused on her cultivation and had no interest in relationships.<br>They were right.<br>Song Luoyi managed to build her name despite only being a junior. Interestingly, her speed of cultivation further hastened when she went beyond the age of a junior.<br>When she was 200 years old, she accompanied her father to attend a festival in the starfield. There were many top-notch powers and powerhouses present in that festival. As a mere junior, Song Luoyi could hardly be considered to be the star of the show.<br>Yet, who could have thought that her father would be humiliated by one of the powerhouses in the starfield? The two of them came to blows.<br>Surprisingly, it was Song Luoyi&rsquo;s father who lost.<br>One must know that the Golden Dragon Flame Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster was ranked within the top three of the starfield. This defeat led to the sectmaster and the entire sect sliding down the power rankings.<br>It could be said that they had been utterly humiliated. The Golden Dragon Flame Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster faced plenty of mockery over that.<br>The experts of the Golden Dragon Flame Sect knew that they weren&rsquo;t a match for the powerhouse, so they chose to take it lying down. At this critical moment, Song Luoyi made a move.<br>Song Luoyi was already well-known in the starfield by then, but she was only a junior whereas the person she was up against was someone who had 20,000 years behind him. Needless to say, no one thought well of Song Luoyi.<br>But somehow, Song Luoyi managed to win the battle.<br>A 200-year-old junior actually defeated a 20,000 years old powerhouse.<br>It was then that Song Luoyi joined the ranks of the starfield&rsquo;s strongest experts. In fact, many believed that she was ranked amongst the top even within the Totem Galaxy. Her reputation reached the peak, and it looked as if nothing could stop her from reaching the top anymore.<br>Yet, Song Luoyi suddenly told Lord Yuwei that she was pregnant.<br>Lord Yuwei was shocked to hear that, for she knew Song Luoyi better than anyone. She knew that Song Luoyi did have an interest in men; it was just that her expectations for her other half were too high. She demanded her other half to be of a similar age as her but stronger, or else she would rather not marry in her lifetime.<br>But Song Luoyi shouldn&rsquo;t have met such a man yet, so how did she get pregnant?<br>Lord Yuwei thought that Song Luoyi had mistakenly consumed some sort of weird medicine. In the world of cultivation, procreation was not a miracle exclusive to the union between a man and a woman. There were also treasures that allowed women to get pregnant without coming into contact with men.<br>It was just that it didn&rsquo;t reflect well on a woman if she were to have a child before marriage, even if it was through the usage of treasures.<br>Song Luoyi was at the peak of her reputation then, so Lord Yuwei firmly believed that she wouldn&rsquo;t do something as reckless as getting into a casual relationship with a man. Thus, she assumed that Song Luoyi must have consumed pregnancy medicine.<br>If that was the case, all they had to do was to abort the child. That was no big deal to a cultivator.<br>However, Song Luoyi said that she had secretly gotten married to someone else, and the child was the flesh and blood of their union. She was determined to go through ten months of pregnancy and bear this child so as to ensure the best for him.<br>Lord Yuwei couldn&rsquo;t believe what she had heard. The two of them had always confided in each other, but never once had Song Luoyi told her that she was interested in anyone, let alone getting married.<br>Song Luoyi began to explain the situation to her.<br>Not too long ago, Song Luoyi headed to another galaxy to train and inadvertently barged into an ancient remnant. The ancient remnant was incredibly dangerous, swiftly overpowering Song Luoyi. Fortunately, someone swooped in to save her, or else she would have lost her life.<br>The person who saved her was much older than her, which should have flouted the conditions she had previously set for her other half. However, love could be mysterious at times. No matter how high one&rsquo;s expectations were, all of those seemed to crumble apart upon meeting one&rsquo;s true love.<br>That was the case for Song Luoyi. She was so determined to find someone who met all of her expectations, but the moment she was saved, she realized that for her whole life, she had been waiting for this man.<br>Nothing was important anymore. She had already made up her mind not to marry anyone but this man.<br>According to Song Luoyi, that man was an incredibly powerful cultivator. It was under his guidance that she was able to grow swiftly and eventually defeat the powerhouse during the festival.<br>There was just one problem. The man had raised an unreasonable request with her after they left the ancient remnant.<br>He said that he was going to do something dangerous and didn&rsquo;t know whether he could return safely. However, he didn&rsquo;t want to die without any offspring, so he wanted Song Luoyi to bear a son for him.<br>What he didn&rsquo;t know was that Song Luoyi had already fallen in love with him and had decided not to marry anyone but him. Even so, Song Luoyi didn&rsquo;t accept his request right away. Instead, she asked why he had chosen her.<br>The man answered that even though he wasn&rsquo;t young anymore, he was not the kind of person who would casually approach any woman. The only reason he had made this unreasonable request of Song Luoyi was because he had fallen in love with her.<br>He was willing to resort to alternative means too if Song Luoyi was reluctant to share physical intimacy with him. Such things were possible for powerful cultivators who had an extreme degree of control over their bodies. They could even freely decide whether the child would be a son or a daughter.<br>In fact, they could even just extract their physical essences in order to make a child, but a child born in a manner tended to be weaker than those who were incubated in the mother&rsquo;s womb for ten months.<br>The man knew that he was making a selfish request, so he told her that he wouldn&rsquo;t force her if she was unwilling.<br>Unexpectedly, Song Luoyi was satisfied with that answer. She accepted his request right away, but she had her own demand too. The two of them would have to make their marriage vows first.<br>So, the two of them got married that very night and solemnized as a couple.<br>The following day, that man told Song Luoyi where his clan was before taking his leave. He told her that their son should be called Chu Xuanyuan, and he left behind a mysterious skill for him. He also promised Song Luoyi that if he managed to return safely, he would surely pay the Golden Dragon Flame Sect a visit and officially ask for her hand in marriage. He would marry her with the highest honors.<br>That man was none other than Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandfather, Chu Hanxian.<br></p></div>
