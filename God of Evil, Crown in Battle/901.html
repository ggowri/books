        <h1>Chapter 901</h1>
        <div> - Flattening the Misty Peak<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect they would also come. This means I&rsquo;m not their sole target&hellip; Their goal is likely the Misty Peak.&rdquo; Chu Feng furrowed his brows. Suddenly, he felt that this situation was not as simple as it appeared.<br>That young man really was too terrifying. Not only was his strength powerful, his clothing made others uneasy&mdash;the talismans all over his body, and the long string of beads over his neck. His appearance looked the exactly like the two young men who had saved Murong Xun. However, his strength was far above those two.<br>If those two had come from the Holy Land of Martialism, this person definitely came from there as well.<br>It was one thing if this was only a battle between those from the Eastern Sea Region. However, if the people from the Holy Land of Martialism interfered, then their present circumstances were far from reassuring.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng! As I thought, you&rsquo;re here!&rdquo;<br>Just at that moment, Murong Xun discovered Chu Feng and the others. He was in a frenzy, like a cat that ate rat feces. His fierce appearance made it seem as if he wanted to eat Chu Feng&rsquo;s flesh and drink his blood.<br>&ldquo;So this infamous brat is Chu Feng! It truly is best to see for myself than to listen to rumours. In these days, you&rsquo;ve truly made quite the commotion in the Eastern Sea Region!<br>&ldquo;I had thought you were some impressive young man, but in the end, you were merely a coward who hides within the Misty Peak,&rdquo; sneered the chief of the Inferno Divine Bird clan.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m sure you know why we have come here today. If you&rsquo;re a man, then come out right now! I can ask Archipelago Master Murong to leave you an undefiled corpse.&rdquo;<br>At the same time, the chief from the Boulder Mutation Beast clan also spoke. His voice was like thunder as it resounded through the air.<br>&ldquo;Chief Panshi<br>[1]<br>, you really view this Chu Feng too highly. If you ask me, this brat&rsquo;s nerves were all broken upon the sight of so many people! He&rsquo;s already performing a miracle by standing there with some sort of stability! You want him to walk to his own death? Hehe, that&rsquo;s simply impossible,&rdquo; said the chief of the Blood-Scale Monstrous Fish clan with an odd and mocking smile.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I am the master of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, Murong Niekong! As long as you hand over my son&rsquo;s Silver Dragon Spear, then kneel and beg for forgiveness, for all the evil actions you&rsquo;ve done to my Immortal Execution Archipelago, I can cast the blame solely on yourself. I won&rsquo;t harm your friends, nor will I blame the Misty Peak for taking you in.&rdquo;<br>Finally, the master of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, Murong Niekong, spoke. However, he had a very nasty attitude. His words meant there was no doubt Chu Feng was dead today. He even wanted Chu Feng to kneel and beg for forgiveness before he would release his friends. Otherwise, he would kill them all.<br>&ldquo;Murong Niekong, that&rsquo;s quite the tone you have here! Where do you think this is? This is not your Immortal Execution Archipelago. This is the Misty Peak! After coming to this place, you think you can do whatever you want to?&rdquo; However, no one expected Chun Wu to shout at a famous and powerful person such as Murong Niekong with such a harsh tone.<br>At that instant, everyone from the Misty Peak couldn&rsquo;t help inhaling deeply. They were not lightly frightened, Xia Yu and Dong Xue especially. They quickly sent her mental messages, telling her not to speak out of turn.<br>&ldquo;Which brat did this one come from? You dare to speak to me like this? Do you not know who I am?&rdquo; Indeed, a hint of displeasure flashed into Murong Niekong&rsquo;s eyes after being retorted.<br>&ldquo;I am the disciple of Lady Piaomiao, Chun Wu. No matter who you are, I will not show you any politeness if you come looking for trouble at the Misty Peak!&rdquo; Chun Wu was very unyielding. Even though she knew they had powerful strength, she was no inferior in terms of outward bearing.<br>Actually, when she spoke, Chun Wu<br>was<br>very afraid. Her current fearless appearance was something she forced out entirely, because it would most definitely be nonsense to say she wasn&rsquo;t afraid of such a formation of people.<br>However, to still dare to retort while fearing them was not something an ordinary person could do.<br>From that, one could tell even though they were all Lady Piaomiao&rsquo;s disciples, Chun Wu was indeed stronger than Xia Yu, Qiu Zhu, and Dong Xue. At least, in terms of courage, she was superior.<br>&ldquo;So you're a disciple of Lady Piaomiao. No wonder the arrogance. However, you are still young, and thus lack experience. For Lady Piaomiao&rsquo;s sake, I won&rsquo;t fault you.<br>&ldquo;However, that Chu Feng is a person whose hands has murdered countless lives and whose back is burdened with countless sins. It will only taint your unblemished land to allow a person like him to stay in the Misty Peak. Quickly send him out. I can then ignore anything that has happened.&rdquo;<br>After knowing Chun Wu&rsquo;s identity, the master of the Immortal Execution Archipelago actually put away his furious complexion, and instead smiled lightly.<br>He planned to put Misty Peak at a higher position, while he at a lower one. He was giving her face.<br>But there was another meaning behind those words, and it was very clear as well: he had already given Lady Piaomiao face now. If she were to return it, then she should tell Chu Feng to go out.<br>If not, that meant she rejected his offer. And if that were the case, then no kindness would be shown today.<br>So, at that instant, everyone within the Misty peak understood what Murong Niekong intended. They all involuntarily cast their gazes towards Chu Feng.<br>Other than those extremely close to Chu Feng, Dong Xue, Xia Yu, and some guardians of the Misty Peak all brought forth some expectation in their eyes&mdash;they wanted to push Chu Feng out.<br>They did not want to die because of an outsider like Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What if we don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; However, at that moment, Chun Wu resolutely spoke. Moreover, there was something else behind her words&mdash;they would not send Chu Feng out.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha, if you don&rsquo;t, then I won&rsquo;t mind flattening your Misty Peak,&rdquo; Murong Niekong said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;What a joke! What do you take the Misty Peak as? You think a ragtag bunch like you can flatten the Misty Peak?&rdquo; Chun Wu mocked.<br>&ldquo;Ragtag bunch? Hoho. I will let an ignorant girl like you know whether or not we&rsquo;re a ragtag bunch.&rdquo;<br>At that instant, Murong Niekong made an odd smile. Then, he slowly raised his arms, then abruptly dropped them quickly. He yelled, &ldquo;Flatten the Misty Peak!&rdquo;<br>After he spoke, it rose the spirits of the army of millions, invoking incomparable excitement. They all rose their arms and shouted:<br>&ldquo;FLATTEN THE MISTY PEAK!<br>&ldquo;FLATTEN THE MISTY PEAK!<br>&ldquo;FLATTEN THE MISTY PEAK!&rdquo;<br>The unison cry of tens of millions of cultivation experts was even more deafening than thunder. It shook the world itself, making it as if it were about to collapse.<br>Panshi = boulder<br>&#9756;<br></p></div>
