        <div> - The Legendary Sun-moon Level<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;The Yin Yang Gate will open soon. All of you, prepare yourselves,&rdquo; a Chu Heavenly Clan elder said.<br>At that moment, the groups of partners walked closer to one another. Furthermore, they all took out their respective Yin Yang Fate Pearls, holding them tightly in their hands.<br>They were prepared to immediately enter the Yin Yang Gate to train once it opened.<br>That said, whilst they were excited and nervous as they waiting for the opening of the Yin Yang Gate, the crowd would still glance at Chu Feng from time to time.<br>Only Chu Feng was by himself. As everyone knew, it was impossible for one to enter the Yin Yang Gate alone.<br>Could it be that a genius like Chu Feng would really end up losing his opportunity to enter the Yin Yang Gate like this?<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it would appear that you&rsquo;re destined to be unable to train in the Nine Moons Sacred Domain this time around.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, compared to that, I am more curious as to why Chu Yue, the person who is closest to you in the Chu Heavenly Clan, decided to leave you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is it really Chu Yue who&rsquo;s kicking her benefactor in the teeth, or is it you who possesses a side unknown to everyone, a side that caused even Chu Yue to so urgently keep her distance from you?&rdquo; Chu Huanyu looked to Chu Feng and spoke in a ridiculing manner.<br>Many people felt sympathetic towards Chu Feng&rsquo;s current situation. Only Chu Huanyu and Chu Haoyan were determined to make Chu Feng unable to recover from his setback.<br>&ldquo;Who told you that Chu Yue is the closest person Chu Feng has in the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; Right at that moment, a spirited voice suddenly sounded.<br>Once that voice was heard, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed. The reason for that was because the person that said those words was Chu Huanyu&rsquo;s partner, Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Little sister Lingxi, you&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Huanyu was caught off guard by Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s remark. At the same time, he started to feel nervous. He seemed to be feeling that the situation was bad for Chu Lingxi to speak for Chu Feng at such a time.<br>Seeing Chu Huanyu&rsquo;s nervous eyes, Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s mouth rose into a strange and mischievous smile. She said, &ldquo;Actually, this young lady is the closest with Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, how could I allow him to be all alone?&rdquo;<br>After she said those words, Chu Lingxi turned around and, before the crowd&rsquo;s attentive eyes, walked over to Chu Feng and placed her arm around Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm. She said to the crowd, &ldquo;Today, I, Chu Lingxi, am going to be Chu Feng&rsquo;s partner.&rdquo;<br>This scene astonished everyone present.<br>Chu Huanyu was completely stunned. Chu Haoyan was also stunned.<br>He had truly never expected that while the scheme that he had meticulously planned succeeded, Chu Lingxi actually stood up for Chu Feng.<br>Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s behavior was simply not in agreement with the way she had handled things in the past. This was simply not the same Chu Lingxi he knew.<br>How could the proud and haughty Chu Lingxi take the initiative to stand together with Chu Feng? Furthermore, she&hellip; she&hellip; she even placed her arm around Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm; such an intimate action.<br>In fact, it was not only the others that were surprised by Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s action; even Chu Feng was surprised.<br>Even he did not expect that Chu Lingxi would stand up for him after he had been betrayed by Chu Yue and left all alone.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, rumbles sounded again. Gradually, the Yin Yang Gate could be seen opening.<br>&ldquo;The Yin Yang Gate has opened. Take out your Yin Yang Fate Pearls and prepare to enter!&rdquo; A Chu Heavenly Clan elder shouted loudly.<br>At that moment, the great majority of people opened their hands and started to harmonize their Yin Yang Fate Pearls with their partners.<br>&ldquo;Chu Yue, your...?!!!&rdquo; At that moment, Chu Haoyan let out a cry of alarm.<br>Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s cry of alarm immediately caught the crowd&rsquo;s attention.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! The Yin Yang Fate Pearl in Chu Yue&rsquo;s hand?!!!&rdquo;<br>When the crowd looked to the Yin Yang Fate Pearl in Chu Yue&rsquo;s hand, their expressions all changed.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Yue&rsquo;s Yin Yang Fate Pearl was at the Full Moon level.<br>&ldquo;A Full Moon-level Yin Yang Fate Pearl. Furthermore, one that doesn&rsquo;t need another Yin Yang Fate Pearl to harmonize with to reach that level?!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, not even Chu Ruoshi was able to remain calm. She had taken great pains to awaken her Yin Yang Fate Pearl to the Half-moon level. However, Chu Yue actually possessed a Full Moon-level Yin Yang Fate Pearl.<br>She was unable to accept it.<br>&ldquo;Chu Yue, how did you accomplish that?&rdquo;<br>Even the elders present walked over to Chu Yue to question her.<br>&ldquo;This is something little brother Chu Feng did,&rdquo; Chu Yue did not attempt to conceal the truth.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo; At that moment, the crowd all cast their eyes to Chu Feng.<br>This level of Yin Yang Fate Pearl that no one in the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s history was able to awaken was actually related to Chu Feng?<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how did you do it?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi turned to question Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s simple. I merely transferred all of the power of my Yin Yang Fate Pearl into Chu Yue&rsquo;s Yin Yang Fate Pearl,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case. Wait, doesn&rsquo;t that mean your Yin Yang Fate Pearl is empty?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s expression took a huge change.<br>At that moment, the expressions of everyone present changed enormously.<br>Then, they all felt what Chu Feng did was unworthy.<br>Chu Feng had truly suffered enormously. He had managed to painstakingly awaken a legendary Full Moon-level Yin Yang Fate Pearl. Yet, that Full Moon-level Yin Yang Fate Pearl was given to someone else.<br>As for he himself, he only possessed an empty Yin Yang Fate Pearl. That was simply a bit too miserable.<br>&ldquo;Chu Lingxi, have a look at my Yin Yang Fate Pearl,&rdquo; right at that moment, Chu Huanyu suddenly opened his palm.<br>The crowd immediately let out a cry of alarm upon seeing Chu Huanyu&rsquo;s Yin Yang Fate Pearl.<br>Although Chu Huanyu&rsquo;s Yin Yang Fate Pearl was far inferior to Chu Yue&rsquo;s Yin Yang Fate Pearl, it still contained a very strong amount of power.<br>&ldquo;Chu Lingxi, if you are to partner up with me, we will definitely be able to harmonize a Half-moon Yin Yang Fate Pearl.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if you are to partner with that Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m afraid you will not even be able to harmonize a Macrostar Yin Yang Fate Pearl.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still not too late for you to turn around,&rdquo; Chu Huanyu said.<br>It turned out that he was trying to make Chu Lingxi reconsider her decision to become Chu Feng&rsquo;s partner.<br>&ldquo;My apologies, this young lady never has fancied that sort of thing,&rdquo; however, even though Chu Huanyu had revealed his Yin Yang Fate Pearl, Chu Lingxi remained unmoved.<br>&ldquo;That said, Chu Feng, I really must lecture you. Are you stupid? Why would you transfer all of the power in your Yin Yang Fate Pearl to Chu Yue&rsquo;s Yin Yang Fate Pearl?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now look at this, Chu Yue has left you and you&rsquo;re now left with nothing. Say, was your decision not foolish?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have simply never seen someone as foolish as you,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi looked to Chu Feng with some complaint on her face. However, more than complaint was regret.<br>Everyone present wanted to know the answer to Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s question.<br>Why would Chu Feng transfer the power of his Yin Yang Fate Pearl into Chu Yue&rsquo;s Yin Yang Fate Pearl?<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very simple, it&rsquo;s because I had a different goal,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Different goal? What sort of goal?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he opened his palm.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, that is?!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd present were all stunned speechless. Endless astonishment filled the eyes of both the people of the older generation and those of the younger generation.<br>The reason for that was because there was a Yin Yang Fate Pearl in Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm. Furthermore, one could clearly see two bodies of light, a sun and a moon, within his Yin Yang Fate Pearl.<br>That Yin Yang Fate Pearl was the highest level Yin Yang Fate Pearl.<br>The legendary Sun-moon level!!!<br><br><br></p></div>
