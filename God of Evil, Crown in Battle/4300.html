        <h1>Chapter 4299</h1>
        <div> - Demon Morph Clan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The process of challenging that terrifying power...<br>The further down the challenge, the more dangerous it was.<br>This was especially true in the final juncture. Even Xianhai Shaoyu nearly failed to withstand it.<br>At that time, it could be said that his life was hanging by a thread. It was so much that he really felt like he would die.<br>The reason for that was because that was the most crucial moment. He must endure through that moment. Even if he felt that he cannot endure anymore, he still cannot stop.<br>But, at the time when Xianhai Shaoyu felt that he would not be able to withstand that power and was about to die, he underwent a metamorphosis after being frantically attacked by the terrifying power.<br>Not only was he able to continue to withstand the terrifying power without any danger to his life, he was also not feeling that much pain.<br>In the end, he endured through everything.<br>As Chu Feng was still alive, he had naturally also endured through everything.<br>But, Chu Feng had fallen unconscious.<br>This made Xianhai Shaoyu think that even though Chu Feng was exceptionally talented and had received the acknowledgement of this place as someone capable of withstanding the power of this place, he, Xianhai Shaoyu, was evidently more talented than Chu Feng.<br>That was why Xianhai Shaoyu was secretly delighted.<br>But, his reactions were understandable. It wasn&rsquo;t that he was envious of Chu Feng or held any hostile intentions. No, it was the contrary. He greatly admires Chu Feng.<br>But, even with that being the case, people would still wish for themselves to be the strongest.<br>This was especially true for someone like Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>While he was not an arrogant and haughty individual like other geniuses, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that he doesn&rsquo;t possess pride and conceit.<br>If he wasn&rsquo;t prideful, he wouldn&rsquo;t have braved dangers to come here to open that black case.<br>He did all that so that he could prove his talent to be unrivaled.<br>&ldquo;Buzz---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a layer of light appeared on Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s body. That light illuminated the surroundings bright like a star.<br>That light contained miraculous power.<br>That&hellip; was the benefit Xianhai Shaoyu received from that terrifying power.<br>That was the power that could strengthen his bloodline.<br>That power was currently fusing with Xianhai Shaoyu. But, as he had simply received too much power, the fusing process needed some time to complete.<br>Furthermore, due to other circumstances, the power materialized itself.<br>&ldquo;Lord father, you were extremely against my decision to come here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you had known that this treasure is able to strengthen one&rsquo;s bloodline, you will likely regret your decision to stop me back then.&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Shaoyu was wild with joy. He had no idea that the power he absorbed would be able to strengthen his bloodline&rsquo;s powers to what degree.<br>But, as his talent was already very strong to begin with, any increase would be an unexpected harvest.<br>He believed that once his father learned of this news, his father would also feel joy for him.<br>&ldquo;That is?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s expression changed enormously.<br>He was shocked to discover Chu Feng&rsquo;s body to also be lingering with light.<br>But, the light around Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was even more dazzling than his own.<br>If that was all, Xianhai Shaoyu wouldn&rsquo;t be so astonished.<br>The reason for his astonishment was because he could sense the power contained within Chu Feng. That power was stronger than what he possessed.<br>Seeing this, Xianhai Shaoyu realized something...<br>But, this was something completely unexpected to him. It&hellip; brought upon him an enormous shock!<br>&ldquo;Is it very confusing?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded from behind Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>Turning around, he saw a figure wearing a dark grey gown standing not far away.<br>&ldquo;Demon Morph Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why are you all here?&rdquo;<br>Seeing this person, Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s expression changed slightly.<br>Xianhai Shaoyu knew who this grey-gowned individual was.<br>Demon Morph Clan. They were a notorious evil power in the vast martial cultivation world.<br>But, they were very strong, so strong that even the rulers of the various galaxies do not dare to underestimate them.<br>The reason for that was because the predecessor to the Demon Morph Clan was the overlord of a galaxy.<br>They were however overthrown by the other powers in their galaxy.<br>After being overthrown, their clan chief degenerated into a life of evil.<br>He also renamed their clan&rsquo;s name as the Demon Morph Clan.<br>The earliest members of the Demon Morph Clan were all people with the same bloodline.<br>But, later on, many other experts that fell from grace joined the Demon Morph Clan.<br>With that, the Demon Morph Clan continued to grow stronger. Right now, they were even stronger than back when they ruled over that starfield.<br>But, the Demon Morph Clan shouldn&rsquo;t be appearing in this place.<br>That was the reason why Xianhai Shaoyu was so surprised.<br>&ldquo;Young master Shaoyu doesn't have to worry about why I am here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, I can tell you this. I&rsquo;ve witnessed everything that happened earlier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You were originally unable to withstand the final tribulation from that power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was that kid. He discovered that you were unable to withstand the power and increased his own absorption of that power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He was the one who saved you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, it is no wonder that he obtained more power than you,&rdquo; said that man from the Demon Morph Clan.<br>&ldquo;I can guess the aid brother Chu Feng gave me even without you telling me.&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Shaoyu was telling the truth. Even though he was very shocked, he realized what happened the moment he saw the power emitted by Chu feng. He had guessed that he failed to obtain metamorphosis during the final moments. Instead, it was Chu Feng who took on greater power for him.<br>&ldquo;So that kid&rsquo;s name is Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that he&rsquo;s someone from this place?&rdquo; asked that man from the Demon Morph Clan.<br>&ldquo;What if he is and what if he&rsquo;s not? What does that have to do with you?&rdquo; Xianhai Shaoyu spoke impatiently.<br>&ldquo;Young master Xianhai Shaoyu, the genius renowned throughout the entire martial cultivation world, actually lost in terms of talent to a nameless nobody in this desolate land.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Say, I bet you&rsquo;re feeling very unpleasant, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, young master Shaoyu, you don&rsquo;t have to feel agitated.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I can help you get rid of this kid.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Go ahead and hand him to me.&rdquo;<br>As that man from the Demon Morph Clan spoke, he suddenly raised his arm.<br>&ldquo;Huuu---&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a boundless suction power was released out from his sleeve.<br>That power was not aiming toward Xianhai Shaoyu. Instead, it was aiming toward Chu Feng who was lying beside Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Courting death!&rdquo; Xianhai Shaoyu snorted coldly.<br>Then, boundless power surged out from his body. It was his oppressive might.<br>His oppressive might materialized itself and bloomed in midair like a volcanic eruption.<br>His oppressive might stopped the suction power moving toward Chu Feng. In addition to that, the oppressive might also unleashed a suction power of its own.<br>The suction was many times more powerful than the one unleashed by that individual from the Demon Morph Clan.<br>That individual from the Demon Morph Clan was unable to withstand the suction and was pulled over to Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>Xianhai Shaoyu did not move at all. But, the oppressive might he unleashed turned into a hand. The hand grabbed onto that man&rsquo;s neck.<br>&ldquo;Speak! Why are you here?!&rdquo; asked Xianhai Shaoyu with a stern voice.<br></p></div>
