        <h1>Chapter 3259</h1>
        <div> - Fierce Futile Offense<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Chu Heavenly Clansmen, apart from Chu Feng and the others that had left for the New Excellence Assembly, were practically all inside the main city.<br>Originally, everything was peaceful.<br>However, a spirit formation gate suddenly appeared out of thin air. This startled the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>The reason for that was because people began to appear from that spirit formation gate. Those people all had a common identity -- they were all from the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>As for the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, they did not place the Chu Heavenly Clan in their eyes at all. Standing high and above, they were like gods on the way to punish mortals as they looked down on the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>&ldquo;Chu Heavenly Clansmen, immediately get the hell out here!&rdquo; A Linghu Heavenly Clansman ordered.<br>&ldquo;Milord, what might have brought you all here?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen had arrived in a fierce and oppressive manner, they did not immediately exit the city, and instead questioned the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen in a respectful tone.<br>Seeing that the Chu Heavenly Clansmen did not come out after they were ordered to do so, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen started frowning with anger in their eyes.<br>&ldquo;Impudent! I ordered you all to get the hell out here, so get out here right now! Otherwise, do not blame me for exterminating your entire clan!&rdquo; That Linghu Heavenly Clansman shouted angrily.<br>That shout caused heaven and earth to tremble violently. That voice that was several times more ear-piercing than thunder allowed the Chu Heavenly Clansmen to realize how furious that Linghu Heavenly Clansman was.<br>It would be a lie to say that the Chu Heavenly Clansmen weren&rsquo;t afraid. After all, these were the masters of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, the people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>Furthermore, even ignoring the strength of the Linghu Heavenly Clan inside the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, the Linghu Heavenly Clan was still the strongest of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s Ten Great Heavenly Clans.<br>Although their Chu Heavenly Clan might be the ruler of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they were truly too inferior when compared to the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>Faced with the strength of the Linghu Heavenly Clan, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were completely lacking in confidence. This was even more so when those Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were already furious.<br>However, even with that being the case, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen still did not leave the main city.<br>The reason for that was because they firmly remembered Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>Chu Feng told them that they must all stay inside the city before his return. He told them that even if they were to discover precious cultivation resources outside the city, they could not leave. The reason for that was because the city was capable of protecting them.<br>&ldquo;Milord, we do not dare to show any disrespect toward you all. Merely&hellip; exactly what is the matter? Might you be willing to inform us first?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clansmen asked cautiously.<br>&ldquo;Impudent bastards! You all are truly people that will refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t teach you all a lesson, you will truly not understand exactly what sort of status you have!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were completely enraged.<br>They who had been completely humiliated by Chu Feng had turned all their anger to the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>With a shout of anger, a person from the Linghu Heavenly Clan started to attack.<br>With a single thought, a storm immediately gathered. With an imposing might capable of toppling mountains and overturning the sea, the attack charged toward the city where the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were located.<br>At that moment, all of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen began to shiver in fear.<br>Being inside the city, they were able to feel how frightening the incoming oppressive might was. The Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were not joking around. They were truly planning to kill them.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a loud explosion was heard. The boundlessly imposing oppressive might turned into energy ripples that scattered outside the city.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, it was not only the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen that were astonished; the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were also astonished.<br>They were able to clearly see that a mirror-like formation had appeared at the location where that oppressive might had scattered.<br>It was a spirit formation. That spirit formation had blocked that Linghu Heavenly Clansman&rsquo;s attack.<br>&ldquo;No wonder you all dared to act so arrogantly; to not put us in your eyes. Turns out, it&rsquo;s because you possess a defensive formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you really think that a mere defensive formation would be able to stop us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, I will have you all understand exactly who has authority in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm!&rdquo;<br>After having his oppressive might blocked, that already furious Linghu Heavenly Clansman became even more enraged.<br>The next moment, it was no longer a single Linghu Heavenly Clansman attacking the city. Instead, all of the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen that had arrived before the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s city began to attack it.<br>Not only did they take out their weapons, but they were also using powerful martial skills.<br>They attacked the city nonstop in wave upon wave. Each wave of attacks was stronger than the last.<br>However, after a series of attacks, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were completely stunned.<br>They had all unleashed their strongest attacks.<br>However, not only were they unable to cause any harm to the Chu Heavenly Clansmen inside the city, but they were unable to even damage the tiles and bricks of the city walls in the slightest.<br>That grand defensive formation had completely blocked all of their attacks.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>It was not only the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen that were stunned; the Chu Heavenly Clansmen inside the city walls were also stunned.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that they had witnessed it with their very eyes, they would never believe that the city that they were in was actually so exceptionally powerful.<br>Their city was actually able to even defend against attacks from Linghu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>One must know that those Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were all emitting extremely powerful auras. To the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, each and every one of them were existences to be feared.<br>At the same time, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen finally understood why Chu Feng had ordered them to stay inside the city and not take a step out.<br>It turned out that there was really a defensive formation around the city. Furthermore, that defensive formation actually possessed such impregnability<br>&ldquo;You bunch of impudent bastards! Release that defensive formation right now! Otherwise&hellip; I will have you all suffer the consequences!&rdquo;<br>Powerless to do anything, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen began to shout loudly.<br>They had arrived at the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s city under Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s orders. They were tasked to capture all of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen. If they failed to accomplish their mission, they would definitely be punished upon their return.<br>Thus, after their attacks against the city ended in failure, they had no alternative but to threaten the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>That said, it must be said that their decision to resort to threats was quite foolish.<br>After all, even a fool could tell that as long as the Chu Heavenly Clansmen remained inside the city, those Linghu Heavenly Clansmen would not be able to do anything to them, whereas if they were to leave the city, it would be akin to throwing away their lives.<br>Although the Chu Heavenly Clansmen felt the threats from the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen to be ridiculous and laughable, none of them laughed. The reason for that was purely because those were Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, people that they could not afford to offend.<br>&ldquo;Milords, what sort of mistake have we made for you all to attack us like this?&rdquo;<br>Even though the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen had already attacked the city, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were still cautious in their speech.<br>A Linghu Heavenly Clansman spoke loudly. &ldquo;Enough of your bullshit! I&rsquo;ll get right to the point!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, if you all are to obediently surrender, you all might be able to leave this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm alive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, all of you shall die here!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although that spirit formation of yours is capable of stopping us, ask yourselves this: is it capable of stopping Linghu Tiemian?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen&rsquo;s expressions changed.<br>Indeed, while the defensive formation was capable of stopping those Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, would it be able to stop Linghu Tiemian?<br>After all, that Linghu Tiemian was the strongest expert in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, the ruler of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ve failed in your attacks, you&rsquo;ve decided to use threats. Linghu Heavenly Clan, you have truly disappointed me.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice sounded from behind the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen. That voice was filled with ridicule.<br></p></div>
