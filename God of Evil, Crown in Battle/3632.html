        <div> - Entering The Chess Formation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking that sword,&rdquo; said Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;Not selling,&rdquo; as Chu Feng spoke, he placed the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword into his Cosmos Sack.<br>&ldquo;You insolent bastard!&rdquo; Many people of the younger generation beside Nangong Yifan stood forth. With how fierce they looked, it seemed like they were planning to forcibly snatch away Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword.<br>&ldquo;Impudent!&rdquo; Right at that moment, a furious shout was heard.<br>It was Lord Shoujian.<br>It was precisely because the person who had shouted furiously was Lord Shoujian that the crowd felt surprised, and even a bit scared.<br>Lord Shoujian had always been very kind and benevolent. Those people of the younger generation had known him for a very long time. Yet, never had any friction occurred between them. This was the first time that they had seen him angry.<br>Furthermore, the crowd discovered that Lord Shoujian was actually very scary when he was angry.<br>Thus, even the arrogant All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were so scared that they changed their fierce appearances and stepped down obediently.<br>That said, there was an exception -- Nangong Yifan.<br>Although Nangong Yifan did not had a fierce look on his face like the other All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations, his gaze was very ill-intended.<br>That ill-intended gaze was currently on Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Never have I, Nangong Yifan, failed to obtain what I want to obtain.&rdquo;<br>Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s tone was filled with a threatening tone as he said those words to Chu Feng. He was threatening Chu Feng, telling him that if he refused to sell the Blue Jade Mandarin Duck Sword, what would await him would be a forced drink of forfeit.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious as to how you&rsquo;ll obtain what I do not wish to give you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You will soon know,&rdquo; Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s gaze became particularly cold.<br>&ldquo;Who are you trying to threaten? Did you think we were afraid of you? Nangong Yifan, listen carefully. If you dare to do anything to my brother Chu Feng, I, Kong Tianhui, will be the first to stand against you,&rdquo; Kong Tianhui stood forth.<br>Nangong Yifan did not bother to pay attention to Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time. If everyone is ready, we&rsquo;ll gather at the chess formation,&rdquo; after saying those words, Lord Shoujian soared into the sky.<br>Seeing that, the younger generations present all soared into the sky in succession. They had all begun to fly after Lord Shoujian.<br>Following Lord Shoujian, Chu Feng and the others soon arrived at the so-called chess formation.<br>That chess formation had a total of three separate areas. Each world had mountains, creeks, rivers, a blue sky and white clouds. They were like three isolated worlds.<br>That said, their surface area was actually not very vast. Furthermore, these three areas were all separated by a power.<br>Furthermore, there was a barrier around the three areas, keeping everything inside them seperate.<br>Chu Feng felt that the chess formation should be the chessboard for Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess.<br>&ldquo;Are you all ready?&rdquo; Lord Shoujian asked the people of the younger generation.<br>&ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; The younger generations answered in unison.<br>They had prepared for a long time for that day. Thus, they were already ready to meet their opponents on the chessfield at any moment.<br>&ldquo;All-heaven, left formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ancestral Martial, right formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Go on in.&rdquo;<br>As Lord Shoujian spoke, two spirit formation gates appeared.<br>The crowd all knew that those two spirit formation gates were the entrances to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess&rsquo;s chessboard. Thus, without any hesitation, they flew into them.<br>&ldquo;Little sister Xian Yun, leave a spot for my brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Kong Tianhui arrived beside Xian Yun.<br>As the number of participants in Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess was limited, if Chu Feng wanted to enter, someone from the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s side had to give up their spot.<br>&ldquo;Xian Yun has already made the preparations. If we waited for you to make your request, how could we have enough time to prepare?&rdquo; said Kong Ci.<br>&ldquo;Little sister Xian Yun, is that true? You&rsquo;ve already prepared a spot for my brother Chu Feng?&rdquo; Kong Tianhui became particularly excited.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng is a guest. Since he's so interested in this Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess, I naturally should allow him to experience it,&rdquo; Xian Yun smiled and nodded.<br>&ldquo;Little sister Xian Yun, you are truly understanding. I&rsquo;m going to give you a big, big hug,&rdquo; as Kong Tianhui spoke, he opened his arms and moved to hug Xian Yun.<br>&ldquo;Scram aside! You shameless bastard, don&rsquo;t think of using this opportunity to take advantage of Xian Yun,&rdquo; before he could approach Xian Yun, Kong Ci kicked Kong Tianhui far away.<br>&ldquo;You are absolutely not my biological younger sister,&rdquo; Kong Tianhui spoke with a look of grievance.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re also not my biological older brother,&rdquo; Kong Ci rolled her eyes at Kong Tianhui. Then, she looked to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, since you&rsquo;ve decided to enter, you must hurry up. Remember&hellip; do not cause trouble, and obey the commands.&rdquo;<br>Right after Kong Ci&rsquo;s words left her mouth, a major disturbance sounded from a distant crowd.<br>It was the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s side.<br>Hearing the noises, Kong Ci, Long Ning, Xian Yun as well as Chu Feng and the others all looked over.<br>It was only then that they discovered that something extraordinary was happening at the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s side.<br>It was Nangong Yifan...<br>At that moment, Nangong Yifan had arrived before their spirit formation gate. It appeared he was planning to enter the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess&rsquo;s chessboard.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Doesn&rsquo;t Nangong Yifan generally only look on without doing anything? Why would he decide to directly participate this time around?&rdquo;<br>The people from the Ancestral Martial Starfield grew restless upon seeing such a thing.<br>Not only were they uneasy, many people revealed fear and even despair in their eyes.<br>Originally, after practicing their formations repeatedly, they gained the confidence to take on the All-heaven Starfield.<br>However, after Nangong Yifan prepared to join the fray, their confidence immediately disappeared. It was all because he was simply too powerful.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the crowd were feeling confused, Nangong Yifan suddenly turned around and looked to the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s side. His gaze was fixed on Chu Feng.<br>That gaze was ice-cold, tyrannical, arrogant, and filled with provocation.<br>It was like he was a god that had grasped Chu Feng&rsquo;s fate.<br>After looking at Chu Feng, Nangong Yifan entered that spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;I got it. That guy decided to change his plan at the last moment to participate in the chess match this time around because of brother Chu Feng,&rdquo; said Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;That shouldn&rsquo;t be possible, no? With how astonishingly strong Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s chess skills are, how could he decide to participate in the chess match because of a newbie like Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The two of them are on completely different levels.&rdquo;<br>The crowd expressed their disapproval of Kong Tianhui&rsquo;s words.<br>Right at that moment, Lord Shoujian&rsquo;s voice was heard.<br>&ldquo;Tianhui&rsquo;s analysis is not without reason.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
