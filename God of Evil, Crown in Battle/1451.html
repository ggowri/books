        <h1>Chapter 1451</h1>
        <div> - It&rsquo;s you?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Actually, those words spoken by Chu Feng had not only stunned the people from the Dongfang Imperial Clan, it had also stunned the people from the World Spiritist Alliance.<br>To dare to publicly insult their Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Third Prince before all these elders from the Dongfang Imperial Clan, how bold must one be?<br>If it was any other person present, other than the Left Reverend, there would likely not be many among them who possessed that sort of boldness. However, this disciple who they had never heard of before actually possessed this sort of boldness. As such, how could the crowd not be shocked?<br>However, while they were shocked, they were also secretly feeling very good. Especially the disciples of the World Spiritist Alliance, they felt that they had managed to blow off steam and raise their chests high.<br>The grand Third Prince of the Dongfang Imperial Clan was actually defeated by a disciple of the World Spiritist Alliance. How could they not be feeling very pleased by that?<br>However, with how enormous the world was, nothing was too bizarre. As for how complicated human hearts were, people would be having all sorts of different ideas. At the moment when the majority of the people were overjoyed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s victory over Dongfang Zexuan, there were also many that felt extremely depressed and even started to detest Chu Feng.<br>The best representation of this crowd was the number one disciple of the World Spiritist Alliance, Lin Yezhou.<br>After the appearances of Su Mei and Feng Chu, his title as the number one disciple was nothing more than an empty name now.<br>Thus, not only was he feeling depressed, he was also detesting this Feng Chu. He detested the fact that this disciple by the name of Feng Chu had defeated Dongfang Zexuan and made him worthless by contrast, making his position as the number one disciple face even more of an imminent danger.<br>Of course, if he were to know that this so-called Feng Chu was actually Chu Feng, it would truly be a wonder as to what sort of expression he would display.<br>&ldquo;To dare insult me like this, you are truly the first.&rdquo;<br>Finally, Dongfang Zexuan spoke. He had managed to calm his state of mind by a lot. It seemed that he had accepted his loss to Chu Feng.<br>However, his eyes were filled with flourishing anger, and the words he spoke were faintly threatening. It was evident that he was not planning to let this matter end like this.<br>&ldquo;Insult? I doubt that&rsquo;s the case. Even if it is, I am merely giving you a taste of your own medicine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if I am truly the first person to have insulted you, then I am very honored to be so,&rdquo; Chu Feng said in a very calm manner. Not only was he not afraid of Dongfang Zexuan&rsquo;s threat, he even spoke to contradict him.<br>&ldquo;You are truly bold to dare speak to me in such a manner. Since this is the case, are you able to remove your black cloak and reveal your true appearance so that I can know exactly what the person that has spoken to me in such a manner looks like,&rdquo; Dongfang Zexuan spoke as he gnashed his teeth.<br>&ldquo;You wish to see my appearance so that you can retaliate against me in the future?&rdquo; Chu Feng guessed Dongfang Zexuan&rsquo;s intentions. Chu Feng had placed an insolation formation from the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram capable of blocking spirit power and other observation methods onto his black cloak.<br>Thus, not to mention the people from the Dongfang Imperial Clan, even someone as powerful as the Left Reverend would not be able to see through his black cloak to discover his appearance.<br>With how much Dongfang Zexuan hated Chu Feng, he would definitely not let the matter end like this. If he were to retaliate in the future, he had to know Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance. Therefore, that was the reason why he wished to see Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance. Unfortunately, with how quick-witted Chu Feng was, he would naturally not fall for his trap.<br>&ldquo;It seems that you do not dare to show your appearance then,&rdquo; Instead of mentioning whether he planned to retaliate or not, Dongfang Zexuan turned the subject around to spur Chu Feng into revealing his appearance.<br>&ldquo;It is not a question of whether I dare or not, but a question of whether you&rsquo;re qualified to see my appearance or not,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Watch your words!&rdquo; Hearing what Chu Feng said, the elders of the Dongfang Imperial Clan were finally unable to contain themselves and berated Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Watch his words? Who are you to interfere?&rdquo; The Left Reverend spoke with dominance. His voice was like that of a loud bell and filled with might. Like a god, he quelled everything with only his voice.<br>After the angry shout from the Left Reverend, the elders of the Dongfang Imperial Clan started to act like frightened little birds. One by one, they lowered their heads and did not dare to utter another word of complaint.<br>Martial Emperors, they were not existences that mere Half Martial Emperors like themselves could contend against. Regardless of how they were peak Half Martial Emperors, as long as they were Half Martial Emperors, the gap between them and Martial Emperors was as far as the heavens from the earth.<br>&ldquo;Third Prince, it is not that you cannot see my true appearance. Merely, you will have to wait until your world spirit techniques surpass mine,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well, there will definitely be a day when I will trample you under my foot. Even in terms of world spirit techniques, you&rsquo;ll still be defeated by me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; After Dongfang Zexuan left those words, he turned around and began to leave.<br>Seeing that, the Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s army immediately followed after him.<br>Although they were very unreconciled to their loss, there was nothing that they could do with the Left Reverend present.<br>&ldquo;Lord Left Reverend, Lord Alliance Master, we have matters that we must attend to, please excuse us too,&rdquo; After the Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s army left, the elders from the Jadewater Temple, Firerain Hall and Eight Desolate Mountain Ranges also left in a hurry.<br>Just like this, the curtains dropped on this competition. As for the result of the competition, it was a gorgeous victory for the World Spiritist Alliance. As for all of this, it was all because of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Wooaahhh~~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Junior brother Feng Chu, you are truly amazing! Even that Dongfang Zexuan was no match for you!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hey, watch your words! How are you certain that he&rsquo;s a junior brother? Call him senior brother. In the future, senior brother Feng Chu will be the number one disciple of our World Spiritist Alliance.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, the plaza, the disciples of the World Spiritist Alliance, that had been silent for a very long time finally burst into an uproar.<br>They were all shouting and cheering a single name, Feng Chu. That was because the person who had defeated Dongfang Zexuan today was not Fu Feiteng, not Lin Yezhou and not Su Mei. Instead, it was this man by the name of Feng Chu.<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip;&rdquo; At this moment, the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master walked over to Chu Feng. Perhaps he might be overly happy to not know that he had such an outstanding disciple, but he, the head of the World Spiritist Alliance, was at a loss as to what to say and was only smiling happily.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, can we switch to a quiet place to talk?&rdquo; Right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly spoke.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Those words surprised the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master and the many elders. They had all thought that, with the people from the Dongfang Imperial Clan gone, it was time for Feng Chu to reveal his true appearance.<br>After all, they also wanted to see the appearance of this extraordinary disciple and figure out who he was.<br>However, they never expected that this disciple would suddenly say these words. A quiet place to talk? What was the meaning of that? What did he wish to talk about?<br>Regardless, he was only a disciple. At this moment, the people present were all very influential people in the World Spiritist Alliance. As such, how could he speak to them in this sort of manner?<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; However, right at the moment when they were hesitating, the Left Reverend spoke.<br>Although all of the people present were very influential characters of the World Spiritist Alliance, although all of them were extraordinary experts and great world spiritists, the grandest character among them was still the Left Reverend.<br>Thus, after the Left Reverend spoke, not to mention the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master, even the elders of the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly all nodded in succession.<br>Thus, under the leadership of the Left Reverend, the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master, Miao Renlong as well as the many elders from the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly all left the plaza and arrived in a large and imposing palace hall.<br>A thing worthy of being mentioned was that other than the great influential characters of the World Spiritist Alliance, Su Mei, Sima Ying and Lin Yezhou also followed over.<br>The reason why they were able to do so was naturally because they possessed powerful backers. There was no need to mention Su Mei. To others, she was the Left Reverend&rsquo;s adopted daughter. As for Sima Ying, she possessed the support of Miao Renlong. Therefore, they would naturally not be obstructed in coming along.<br>As for Lin Yezhou, his background was no small matter either. In fact, he was even more frightening than Sima Ying. His grandfather, his grandmother, his father and his mother were all elders of the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly.<br>Furthermore, at this moment, all of them were present. Thus, he was naturally qualified to come along as well.<br>Furthermore, Lin Yezhou very much wanted to see exactly what sort of appearance this Feng Chu who had stolen his limelight had.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, Feng Chu must apologize for the great blunder that he has made today,&rdquo; After he arrived at a secluded place, the first thing that Chu Feng did was bow to them and apologize.<br>&ldquo;My, Feng Chu, what do you mean by that? You have done a great service to our World Spiritist Alliance. What wrong is there?&rdquo; Hearing what Chu Feng said, the elders were confused. They had all planned to reward Feng Chu and had never thought of blaming him.<br>&ldquo;I am in the wrong because I have pretended to be a disciple of the World Spiritist Alliance.&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he removed the black cloak that covered him and revealed his true appearance.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s you?!!!&rdquo;<br>After seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance, other than the Left Reverend and some others, the rest of the people present were all struck dumb. Especially Lin Yezhou, his appearance was extremely ugly. It was as if he had just been fed dogshit.<br></p></div>
