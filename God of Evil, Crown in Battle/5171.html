        <div>: A Shy Girl<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yue Ling soon finished her painting. The person in the portrait was indeed Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Why would this happen?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was confused. He was confident that his formation should have worked on Yue Ling and the others, but the situation was telling him another story.<br>Could it be that a powerful existence had undone Chu Feng&rsquo;s alteration of their memories?<br>This conjecture induced Chu Feng&rsquo;s vigilance.<br>&ldquo;That benefactor of yours is young. Did he alter his appearance?&rdquo; the elder picked up the painting and asked.<br>Upon hearing those words, the other disciples endured the pain to look at the painting.<br>&ldquo;Junior, do you really have to do this?&rdquo; the dashing male disciple said while hissing in pain.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean? Yue Ling asked.<br>&ldquo;You can just say it straight if you don&rsquo;t want our master to know what your benefactor looks like. It isn&rsquo;t right for you to lie to our master like that,&rdquo; the dashing male disciple replied.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t lie to our master,&rdquo; Yue Ling replied in confusion.<br>&ldquo;You did. Your painting is fake. This is the real appearance of your benefactor.&rdquo;<br>The dashing male disciple quickly drew out another painting using his spirit power.<br>Yue Ling had personally drawn the painting out of respect for Chu Feng, but the dashing male disciple didn&rsquo;t harbor the same feelings. He quickly manifested the painting using his spirit power, such that it only took moments for a person to appear in the portrait.<br>The portrait showed the altered appearance of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not right. You&rsquo;re the one who is lying to our master. That&rsquo;s not how my benefactor looks!&rdquo; Yue Ling harrumphed angrily.<br>&ldquo;Fellow seniors and juniors, why don&rsquo;t you be a judge and say who is the one lying here?&rdquo; the dashing male disciple said.<br>&ldquo;Eyy, junior. There&rsquo;s really no need for you to lie to our master,&rdquo; the other disciples chirped in.<br>That told Chu Feng that his formation did work, just that the effects somehow didn&rsquo;t apply to Yue Ling.<br>&ldquo;Master, I really didn&rsquo;t lie to you!&rdquo; Yue Ling cried out indignantly.<br>&ldquo;All of you, shut your mouth! How dare you cause a fuss after what you have done? Do you need more whips before you&rsquo;re finally willing to be obedient?&rdquo; the elder spat as he began another round of lashing.<br>The disciples cried in agony. They felt indignant about this matter, but they dared not to argue with Yue Ling anymore.<br>Meanwhile, the elder continued staring at Chu Feng&rsquo;s portrait.<br>&ldquo;Master, do you recognize him?&rdquo; Yue Ling asked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, but I can ask my friends. Don&rsquo;t worry, Ling&rsquo;er,&rdquo; the elder said.<br>&ldquo;Master, you can ask around, but you mustn&rsquo;t reveal that my benefactor was the one who killed those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan. We have to keep his identity a secret,&rdquo; Yue Ling said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Ling&rsquo;er. He saved your life. I won&rsquo;t do anything that harms him. It&rsquo;s just that you aren&rsquo;t the only ones who saw him make a move on the Situ World Spiritist Clan that day, so word is bound to get out,&rdquo; the elder said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s their matter. At the very least, the secret shouldn&rsquo;t be leaked from us,&rdquo; Yue Ling said before directing a glare at the other disciples.<br>Understanding Yue Ling&rsquo;s intention, the elder ordered them not to divulge Chu Feng&rsquo;s affairs, or else they would be harshly punished. The disciples quickly agreed to it.<br>Hoping to receive news about Chu Feng from the elder, Yue Ling went with the elder&rsquo;s plan and chose to remain in the sect for the time being. She returned to her residence to rest.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng started to look around the nameless sect. After some searching around with Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, his attention was eventually drawn to a forbidden land.<br>The forbidden land was sealed off by a barrier, but Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that a barrier in a Lower Realm could pose an obstacle to him. He started attempting to breach the barrier, but his face soon turned grim.<br>&ldquo;What a formidable barrier.&rdquo;<br>The formation looked ordinary at first glance, but when Chu Feng tried to breach it, he quickly discovered that there were no openings at all. He was unable to breach it with his current level of spirit power.<br>&ldquo;This is probably where Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s legacy is from.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng believed that something extraordinary was hiding on the other side of the barrier. What else could be hidden in this barren mountain with poor natural energies other than the legacy?<br>That was also probably why the sect deemed this area as a forbidden land.<br>&ldquo;It looks like there&rsquo;s more to this sect than I thought.&rdquo;<br>Given that this was a forbidden land of the nameless sect, there was a good chance that they had a way to pass through the barrier.<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t tell whether the nameless sect used to have its fair share of glory, but the ones currently in the sect weren&rsquo;t too strong. There wasn&rsquo;t even a single peak Martial Exalted level cultivator amongst them.<br>The strongest one was Yue Ling&rsquo;s master, who was at rank seven Martial Exalted level.<br>To be fair, that was plenty impressive in the Holy Light Galaxy, but Chu Feng could easily deal with him if he wanted to.<br>Thus, he decided to head to the upper echelons of the nameless sect and force them into divulging the method to enter the forbidden land. Once he gained access to it, he would erase their memories.<br>That was the simplest and most effective method.<br>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, Chu Feng noticed a person heading in his direction. It was none other than Yue Ling.<br>Thus, he decided to wait in the area till Yue Ling arrived.<br>Yue Ling was indeed heading for the forbidden land. Without taking anything out, she dashed straight for the barrier.<br>Weng!<br>Astonishingly, the seemingly indestructible barrier let her through without any resistance.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng quickly walked up to the barrier and saw that it was still as indestructible as before. He was still unable to enter or breach it. This was weird as such barriers would typically require a spirit formation key in order to access, but Yue Ling didn&rsquo;t bring out anything of that sort at all.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s indeed something weird about that girl.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that it was just a coincidence that his memory alteration formation failed on Yue Ling. Thus, he decided to wait for Yue Ling instead of finding anyone else in the nameless sect.<br>It was only eight hours later, after the sun rose once more, that Yue Ling finally came out. Her eyes were puffy, possibly because she had cried for the entire night. It was only normal for her to tear up after the humiliation she had been put through, though it was baffling why she had chosen to cry inside the forbidden land.<br>That was a question he had to ask Yue Ling in order to know the answer.<br>Chu Feng first verified that there was no one in the vicinity before showing himself to her.<br>&ldquo;Miss Yue Ling,&rdquo; Chu Feng called out.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor?&rdquo;<br>Yue Ling was astonished to see Chu Feng. She rubbed her own reddened eyes once more before asking once more in uncertainty, &ldquo;Benefactor, is that really you?&rdquo;<br>She found it hard to believe that the benefactor she was looking for was actually here.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me. Miss Yue Ling, there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d like to ask you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Yue Ling&rsquo;s depressed mood cleared away as soon as she confirmed that the person before her was the benefactor she was searching for. With heightened spirits, she asked, &ldquo;Benefactor, what would you like to know?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How were you able to enter this forbidden land? Did you have a spirit formation key on you?&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed to the barrier and got straight to the point.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a spirit formation key to pass through this formation,&rdquo; Yue Ling replied.<br>&ldquo;Ah? You don&rsquo;t need a spirit formation key?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in surprise.<br>&ldquo;I was able to do it from birth. Benefactor, do you want to enter the forbidden land? I can bring you in with me,&rdquo; Yue Ling said.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; are able to bring me in?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I can.&rdquo;<br>Yue Ling nodded vigorously in response. She stretched her little hand toward Chu Feng, only to suddenly stop in front of him.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor, can I hold your hand?&rdquo;<br>Yue Ling&rsquo;s little face instantaneously reddened like a ripened apple as she said those words. Her reaction induced a smile from Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng took the initiative to grab her soft little hands, only to notice that they were trembling.<br>This girl is really a shy one<br>, he thought.<br></p></div>
