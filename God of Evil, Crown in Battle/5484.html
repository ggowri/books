        <h1>Chapter 5484: Changing Attitudes</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>The crowd could hear Long Zhizhi&rsquo;s words loud and clear.</span><br><span>They first looked at her wounds, followed by the countless corpses lying in the first sector. It was finally becoming obvious to them what was going on.</span><br><span>The battle in the second sector soon died down, but a mere instant later, a battle broke out in the third sector.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Fast! He defeated another ten thousand formation soldiers! At this rate, he might really just be able to defeat all of the formation soldiers within an incense stick&rsquo;s time!&rdquo; a suave junior exclaimed with glowing eyes.</span><br><span>It was the same junior who had told Chu Feng earlier that Long Zhizhi had entered the second sector. The shock in his gaze was slowly turning into admiration.</span><br><span>A prodigy from the Totem Dragon Clan was </span><span>admiring a junior from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy! Probably no one in the world of cultivation would have believed such a thing to be possible!</span><br><span>&ldquo;What nonsense are you spouting? He might be able to deal with those formation soldiers with his unorthodox means, but do you know how many sectors there are left? How could he clear all of the formation soldiers within an incense stick&rsquo;s time all alone?&rdquo; a bald man stepped forward to refute the suave junior.</span><br><span>The bald man appeared to be of a higher standing than the suave junior, as the latter dared not to argue back despite disagreeing with the bald man&rsquo;s words.</span><br><span>The bald man gleefully turned to Long Zhizhi and asked, &ldquo;Miss Zhizhi, am I right?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Long Zhizhi coldly looked at him and sneered, &ldquo;Are you hoping for our Totem Dragon Clan to fail this trial right now?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;T-that&rsquo;s not what I mean. It&rsquo;s just that Chu Feng is an out&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng is our clan chief&rsquo;s guest even if he is an outsider. He is fighting on our behalf even though he isn&rsquo;t getting anything good out of this, whereas you, despite being a Totem Dragon Clansman, are standing here, unable to contribute anything at all. Don&rsquo;t you think that you aren&rsquo;t qualified to mock him regardless of whether he succeeds or not?&rdquo; Long Zhizhi asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Even if we have bad blood with Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s no denying that he&rsquo;s fighting for us right now. It is inappropriate for you to say such words at this juncture.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The others also began speaking up against the bald man. It was hard to tell whether they were trying to get into Long Zhizhi&rsquo;s good books or that their views on Chu Feng had really changed, but more and more people began speaking up for Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;T-that&rsquo;s not what I mean.&rdquo; The bald man was put in an awkward position.</span><br><span>He had said those words to get into Long Zhizhi&rsquo;s good books, but who could have thought that it would backfire on him?</span><br><span>Time slowly ticked by. Chu Feng cleared the sectors one after another.</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen who had previously given up on the trial rekindled their hopes. The incense stick was on the verge of burning out, but Chu Feng had also reached the final sector too.</span><br><span>Many Totem Dragon Clansmen started to become nervous. They hoped for Chu Feng&rsquo;s success even though they didn&rsquo;t have a good impression of him, as they knew that his success would be to the benefit of their clan.</span><br><span>Right before the incense stick burned out, the final sector fell silent.</span><br><span>However, that only made the crowd even more nervous. They couldn&rsquo;t tell if Chu Feng had defeated all of the formation soldiers in time or if he was forced to stop because time was up.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>Thunder suddenly rumbled from the distance. The stone monument floating in mid-air shattered, and a powerful surge of spirit power converged into a gigantic spirit formation gate. At the same time, the formation beneath them dissipated in a wisp of smoke.</span><br><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s silhouette appeared behind the smoke.</span><br><span>He sat on the floor, gasping for air. He was extremely exhausted even though he was unharmed. He was completely soaked in sweat as if he had just been through torrential rain.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the situation, Chu Feng? Did you succeed?&rdquo; Long Zhizhi rushed forward and asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What about the benefits? What&rsquo;s our benefit for deciphering the formation?&rdquo; the bald man rushed forward and asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What are you in such a hurry for?&rdquo; Long Zhizhi coldly glared at the bald man.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t mean anything by that. I just thought that it was weird that we didn&rsquo;t receive any benefits even though he claimed that he had deciphered the formation, so&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>The bald man&rsquo;s explanation was cut short by Long Zhizhi&rsquo;s cold eyes. It finally dawned on him that Chu Feng&rsquo;s position was no longer the same as before, so he humbly backed down.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Take this. It&rsquo;ll aid in your recovery.&rdquo; Long Zhizhi offered a pill to Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need it. I have already eaten one. Let&rsquo;s proceed after I rest for a moment.&rdquo; Chu Feng sat down and meditated. Slowly, his depleted energy began to recover.</span><br><span>The crowd quietly waited for Chu Feng to recover.</span><br><span>Moments later, Chu Feng opened his eyes and got to his feet. He opened his closed palm, and eight tokens floated into the air.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This is the reward for deciphering the formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is that all? What&rsquo;s the use of the token?&rdquo; Long Zhizhi couldn&rsquo;t tell what was special about the tokens.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what use they have either, but we should find out soon enough,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he made his way toward the spirit formation gate in the sky.</span><br><span>Long Zhizhi and the others quickly followed suit.</span><br><span>They found themselves entering yet another corridor, but it was one broader than before. Complicated runes and images were inscribed on its walls.</span><br><span>Chu Feng slowly proceeded with his eyes focused on the front, whereas the Totem Dragon Clansmen kept pace behind him. Had it been before, they might have ignored Chu Feng and rushed straight ahead, but they were much more obedient now after the earlier happenings.</span><br><span>It also helped that Long Zhizhi, the de facto leader of the Totem Dragon Clansmen, was obediently following Chu Feng.</span><br><span>The suave junior from earlier walked up to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, I am Long Fulai. You have my deepest gratitude for what happened earlier.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to stand on ceremony. I&rsquo;m only doing what I should,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span><br><span>He had been keeping an eye on the juniors, so he knew that Long Fulai was one of the few juniors who didn&rsquo;t bear much hostility toward him from the very start.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, how did you manage to defeat so many rank five Half-God level formation soldiers within such a short period of time? There were eighty thousand of them!&rdquo; Long Fulai asked.</span><br><span>The others also turned to Chu Feng as well. This was a question they had been wondering too.</span><br></p></div>
