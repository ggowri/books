        <h1>Chapter 5052</h1>
        <div>: The Powerhouse Who Died Pitifully<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That grand elder was the master of the incumbent Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief back then, as well as the strongest cultivator amongst them. Even though she wasn&rsquo;t the clan chief, she possessed the greatest say within the clan.<br>She proposed a plan to assassinate that man using a flavorless and scentless poison to the other clan members. Most voiced their disapproval, but a small portion of people who believed in prioritizing their own self-interests over others expressed their approval.<br>The grand elder was planning to use a flavorless and scentless poison to kill that man.<br>Out of deference for the grand elder&rsquo;s strength and standing, the clan members had no choice but to go along with her decision despite not agreeing with it.<br>So, after obtaining the way to use the energy from the man, the grand elder prepared a banquet in the name of thanking him. However, she secretly spiked the alcohol with poison.<br>Completely unguarded toward the Monstrous Spirit Clan, the man drank the alcohol and swiftly lost his life. However, after his heart stopped beating, his body and clothes suddenly began turning into stone, much to the astonishment of the grand elder.<br>The grand elder had wanted to obtain more treasures from the man, so she tried to shatter the statue, only to find that it was indestructible despite its humble appearance.<br>Bizarre things started happening after that.<br>Not too long after the man died, the Monstrous Spirit Clan suddenly lost control of the puppet army that was given to them. The puppets started slaughtering the members of the Monstrous Spirit Clan, but the casualties consisted of only a few selected individuals.<br>They were the people who had approved the plan to poison the man. Of course, the grand elder was included in there too.<br>All of those who initially opposed the plan, including the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, were left unharmed. However, despite being spared from the slaughter, fear continued to linger amongst the surviving members.<br>In hopes of putting an end to this matter, the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief kneeled down before the man&rsquo;s statue and begged for his forgiveness. In a bid to placate his anger, she promised him that the future generations of the Monstrous Spirit Clan would worship him.<br>An apology shouldn&rsquo;t have made any difference at this juncture. The man was already dead, and the idea of him returning as a vengeful spirit was nothing but superstition.<br>Yet, it somehow worked.<br>The puppet army dissipated into dust shortly after the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief gave her promise, but the energy brought in by that man remained. Later on, the clan chief ordered for the man&rsquo;s statue to be moved over to this place when they were planning to migrate over.<br>Tens of thousands of years had passed since then, but the members of the Monstrous Spirit Clan dared not to forget about their ancestors&rsquo; sins. They still held a deferential attitude toward the man and continued to worship him.<br>&ldquo;To think that such a thing had happened back then. That man must have been a powerhouse in the world of cultivation to possess such means and energy. It must have been aggravating to die just like that,&rdquo; Wang Yuxian said.<br>The Monstrous Spirit Clan had indeed done that man injustice.<br>&ldquo;Elder, do you know why that man wanted to reside in the Monstrous Spirit Clan?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was more curious about that man&rsquo;s goal.<br>A cultivator that had the means to create such a powerful army wouldn&rsquo;t raise a request for no reason. He must have his own goal for requesting this.<br>&ldquo;The lord mentioned that he was waiting for someone in the Monstrous Spirit Clan, and he would leave once that person arrived. However, no one in the Monstrous Spirit Clan believed his words. They thought that it was just an excuse for him to court the ladies of the Monstrous Spirit Clan,&rdquo; Yao Cheng said.<br>&ldquo;He was waiting for someone? I guess there&rsquo;s no point trying to figure out who he was waiting for anymore. Tens of thousands of years have already passed since then. The person he was waiting for must have already passed away,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>While cultivators had longer lifespans, very few were able to live beyond ten thousand years. Tens of thousands of years was usually the cap. Someone from that era couldn&rsquo;t have possibly survived till now.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over now. Are they not planning to leave?&rdquo;<br>The last junior was finally done with her talent assessment, but the group showed no signs of leaving. Instead, they began gathering the statue to place more offerings on top of the altar.<br>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t good. Today happens to be a day where we pay respects to the lord. How could I have forgotten about that?&rdquo; Yao Cheng exclaimed in a fluster.<br>&ldquo;How long would the ceremony last?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Today is a special day. It&rsquo;ll take at least two hours at the very minimum. The talent assessment formation would have been deactivated by then. I made a huge miscalculation,&rdquo; Yao Cheng said in a fluster.<br>&ldquo;It looks like we&rsquo;ll have no choice but to risk it. Lele, you should wait here for me.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng began making his move. Keeping his body hidden under a concealment formation, he quietly flitted his way over to the talent assessment formation and leaped onto the circular platform.<br>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t good.&rdquo;<br>As soon as he landed on the talent assessment formation, his concealment formation began to unravel. Some members of the Monstrous Spirit Clan immediately spotted him.<br>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; a furious bellow echoed.<br>Everyone on the square immediately turned to Chu Feng with hostility in their eyes.<br>Boom!<br>The space suddenly quivered. A powerful gush of martial power rushed in Chu Feng&rsquo;s direction, harnessing the might of a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator!<br></p></div>
