        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>&ldquo;Give up, Feng Tiansheng. At this rate, you won&rsquo;t be able to stand up even without me making a move,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I have to win this battle,&rdquo; Feng Tiansheng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, let me give you a helping hand too,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he tightened his grip around the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword and unleashed a wave of sword qi.</span><br><span>The sword qi was aimed at Feng Tiansheng, but it deviated slightly off position. This relieved Feng Tiansheng&rsquo;s tensed nerves by a fair bit.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It looks like you have reached your limit too,&rdquo; Feng Tiansheng said with a triumphant smile.</span><br><span>He figured that Chu Feng must have reached his limits too, especially given the extreme speeds the latter had been moving at to evade his attacks. Otherwise, why would Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword qi veer off target?</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>Another sword qi suddenly appeared out of nowhere before Feng Tiansheng. By the time he noticed it, it had already squarely struck him.</span><br><span>Unlike the previous waves of sword qi, this one commanded far greater strength that completely shattered the surrounding golden light. The force knocked Feng Tiansheng onto the floor and rendered him immobile.</span><br><span>Chu Feng leaped down from the sky and landed next to Feng Tiansheng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;W-what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Feng Tiansheng asked.</span><br><span>The means Chu Feng had just employed was rank nine Exalted Taboo Martial Skill, Exalted Taboo Shadow Severing Hack. Not only was it powerful, but it could be used to catch one&rsquo;s enemy off guard. The earlier sword qi might have looked like it had veered off target, but its trajectory would still strike Feng Tiansheng squarely.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What kind of despicable means did you resort to this time around?&rdquo; Feng Tiansheng asked indignantly.</span><br><span>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t answer the question, instead saying, &ldquo;Apologize to my friends.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Apologize? Why should I do that? You used despicable means to defeat me! I refuse to admit defeat!!!&rdquo; Feng Tiansheng roared.</span><br><span>Seeing that, Chu Feng raised his hand and released the red lightning aura he had been using to fill the formations, but he aimed it at the phoenix avatar above Feng Tiansheng&rsquo;s head. Shockingly, the phoenix avatar was swept away by the red lightning aura and absorbed into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd was stunned. They couldn&rsquo;t believe that Chu Feng had taken away the intangible phoenix silhouette on Feng Tiansheng&rsquo;s head. Was he really human? It was almost as if they weren&rsquo;t living on the same plane of existence!</span><br><span>Of course, Chu Feng had only made that bet because he realized that he could steal the avatars with his red lightning aura. He waved his sleeves and directed the red lightning aura toward the other Totem Phoenix Clansmen too, stealing away their avatars.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Feng Tiansheng, call your big sister here. I&rsquo;ll be waiting for her at the next formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng followed Long Chengyu and Long Muxi&rsquo;s aura trail to the next formation, but similar to before, the two of them were nowhere to be seen, though there were Totem Dragon Clansmen working on completing the formation. Even Long Zhizhi and Long Yuhong weren&rsquo;t there either.</span><br><span>Nevertheless, he stepped in and helped the Totem Dragon Clansmen complete their formation. Moments after the formation was complete, several figures flew over from ahead. Long Yuhong and Long Zhizhi were amongst them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Chu Feng!!!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Their eyes lit up with relief as soon as they saw Chu Feng, as if they had seen their savior.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng!!!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Before they could answer the question, a furious bellow echoed from behind. A huge army comprising the defeated Feng Tiansheng, Feng Jiuyue, and the other Totem Phoenix Clansmen arrived at the scene.</span><br><span>Shoosh!</span><br><span>Without any hesitation, Feng Jiuyue sent a ray of light toward Chu Feng with a wave of her sleeves, but before the light could reach him, it suddenly expanded to form a massive barrier sealing off the surroundings.</span><br><span>It appeared to be the same means as Feng Tiansheng had employed earlier, but Chu Feng frowned. He could tell that this was an extremely powerful formation that could only be used once, but it was many times stronger than what Feng Tiansheng had used earlier.</span><br><span>Most important of all, there were four words inscribed on the formation&mdash;Seven Realms Sacred Mansion!</span><br><span>&ldquo;Where did you obtain that from?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>Instead of answering the question, Feng Jiuyue stepped into the formation and said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, I don&rsquo;t ask you to help us anymore, but I hope that you can return what you have stolen from my younger brother and the other Totem Phoenix Clansmen. Our clan is already at a disadvantage. If we lose that power too, we won&rsquo;t be able to compete at all.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Your younger brother refused to abide by the agreement we have made. This is the punishment he deserves,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, can you sense the fluctuations of the formation? This sealing formation </span><span>has the power to restrain your martial power. I know that you&rsquo;re a powerful cultivator, or else my younger brother wouldn&rsquo;t have fallen in defeat, but there&rsquo;s nothing you can do once your martial power has been sealed off. I don&rsquo;t wish to make a move on you. As long as you return the avatars, we&rsquo;ll call it quits,&rdquo; Feng Jiuyue said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng burst into laughter.</span><br><span>He suddenly flitted up to Feng Jiuyue like a specter and hurled his fist straight toward her abdomen.</span><br><span>Stunned, Feng Jiuyue quickly dodged the punch with incredible speed.</span><br><span>However, Chu Feng opened up his palm to reveal a martial power formation hidden within it. The martial power formation exploded, sending devastating shockwaves at Feng Jiuyue. She couldn't evade it at such a close distance.</span><br><span>Feng Jiuyue&rsquo;s body slammed heavily against the formation walls. She was trapped in the formation too since she had voluntarily stepped into it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Doesn&rsquo;t that formation restrict one&rsquo;s martial power? Why did our young miss&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Phoenix Clansmen, who knew about the capabilities of the martial power formation, were taken aback by Feng Jiuyue&rsquo;s defeat.</span></p></div>
