        <h1>Chapter 5630: Tell Me What’s Going On</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Song Yuping finally panicked upon sensing Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength and seeing his cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, my grandfather is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to report her identity, but Chu Feng flung his arm and threw her to Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>. The resulting fall inflicted far worse injuries than what Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> sustained from Chu Feng&rsquo;s punch, partially due to her weaker spirit power. Her organs had been rattled, forcing her to lie on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gritted her teeth in pain, and tears trickled from her eyes. Even so, she still continued to glare at Chu Feng. &ldquo;</span><span>You&rsquo;re</span><span> dead meat, Chu Feng, I won&rsquo;t let you off.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll die, but not in your hands. As for the two of you&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered as he pointed his finger at the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A huge boulder carrying immense pressure manifested above Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> and Song Yuping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you dare!&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> bellowed, but it did nothing to slow the boulder&rsquo;s momentum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made the crowd realize that Chu Feng had no qualms about killing Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Audacious!&rdquo; a furious voice echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boulder shattered into countless pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An elder appeared in front of Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>. He was from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but his clothes made it clear that he was no ordinary elder. He was the managerial elder tasked with managing this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few other elders appeared together with him. Some of them flitted behind Chu Feng to grab his arms, legs, and head to press him down onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how dare you wreak havoc on our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s turf? Are you tired of living?&rdquo; the managerial elder roared angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>You&rsquo;re</span><span> birds of the same feather,&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I see you have no desire to repent. Men, incarcerate Chu Feng in our underground prison for life!&rdquo; the managerial elder ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Incarcerate him for life?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd immediately realized that Chu Feng was in trouble. They understood that the managerial elder intended to torture him till his death, which was worse than outright killing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Elder, I suspect that there might be a misunderstanding here. We should further investigate this matter,&rdquo; the elder who had been collecting Chu Feng and Chen Hui&rsquo;s crops for the past few days stepped forward and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; the managerial elder roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder quickly zipped his mouth. The other elders holding Chu Feng in place began dragging him off to the underground prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hold on for a moment,&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> suddenly spoke up. He bowed to the managerial elder and said, &ldquo;Lord Elder, there are a few words I&rsquo;d like to tell Chu Feng.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; the managerial elder said with a wave of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> walked up to Chu Feng and leaned into his ear to say, &ldquo;Chu Feng, do you remember what I told you? I told you that I&rsquo;d put you in your place. </span><span>So</span><span> what if you&rsquo;re talented? Without any backing, your accomplishments will only be devoured by me. I can take your life whenever I want to. That&rsquo;s my strength as the young master of the Immortal Spirit Manor.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words were not spoken through voice transmission but a whisper. Those present here were powerful world spiritists, whose senses were sharp enough to pick up the slightest noise. They naturally heard his words loud and clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao&rsquo;s</span><span> intention. He wanted to build his authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, I, Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>, have cheated. I know that you are indignant, but what can you do about it? Chu Feng feels indignant too, and this is his outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of the juniors were frustrated and displeased, but at the same time, they felt helpless too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the sky suddenly tremored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd raised their heads and saw two figures floating in mid-air. It took just a split second for all of the elders from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, including the managerial elder, to kneel onto the floor and kowtow to the two figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Paying respects to the Saint-tier elders.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The duo who had just arrived were Saint-tier Elder Ling </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> and Jie </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of the juniors, including Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>, quickly kneeled down and bowed as well. They also knew how powerful the Saint-tier elders were. Even Song Yuping, who had been quietly sobbing due to the excruciating pain, strained herself to get up and kneel </span><span>on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Chu Feng?&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> asked as he swept the area below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that one,&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Qinghe</span><span> replied as he pointed to Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders had pressed Chu Feng down onto the ground so that they could kneel down and pay respects to the two Saint-tier elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> didn&rsquo;t seem too surprised by that sight. With a smile on his lips, he descended onto the ground, landed right beside Chu Feng, and asked, &ldquo;Oh? What sin did he commit?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders pinning Chu Feng down quickly released their grip, but that only prompted Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> to ask with a smile, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Do what you have to. There&rsquo;s no need to change your decision just because I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words put the elders in a spot. In a state of panic, they really pinned down Chu Feng once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Milord, this man has killed many innocent people,&rdquo; the managerial elder stepped forward and explained. &ldquo;He almost went on a killing spree earlier, so the young master of the Immortal Spirit Manor, Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>, stepped forward to stop him. However, that despicable man resorted to a surprise assault and turned the tables on Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>. It was a relief that I arrived in time to stop him, or else Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> might have lost his life.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about that later. We came here for another matter.&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> impatiently waved his hand, gesturing for the managerial elder to back down. He then squatted down in front of Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;Chu Feng, are there any Saint-tier treasures you are interested in?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was taken aback by the abrupt question. Even Chu Feng was stunned as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saint-tier treasures were the highest reward for the entrance examination. What could Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> mean by posing this question to Chu Feng?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> took out a scroll and casually flicked it, unfurling the scroll. The managerial elder&rsquo;s knees nearly caved in when he saw the content of the scroll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scroll was an edict instructing Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> to ask Chu Feng what Saint-tier treasure he was interested in and to prepare it in advance. The most important thing of all was that the scroll contained the seal of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders who were pinning Chu Feng down shuddered in fear, but they didn&rsquo;t let go of him right away. It was not that they didn&rsquo;t want to, but that their bodies had stiffened up in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I have come under the orders of the mansion master,&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> emphasized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Elder, I heard that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion has a treasure known as the Seven Realms Soul Forging Incense. May I know if it really exists?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion does have the Seven Realms Soul Forging Incense, and it is a Saint-tier treasure. It&rsquo;s just that this treasure is a little special. It&rsquo;s deemed to be a Saint-tier treasure due to its medical potency, but it doesn&rsquo;t contribute </span><span>to a world spiritist or world spirit&rsquo;s cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you certain that this is the treasure you want? I can introduce other Saint-tier treasures to you if you like,&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Elder, are there any better treasures to reinforce a world spirit&rsquo;s soul?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I see; that&rsquo;s the kind of treasure you are looking for. If so, the Seven Realms Soul Forging Incense is your best choice,&rdquo; Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to choose this treasure if I have the fortune to choose a Saint-tier treasure from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll note it down.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elder </span><span>Zhenfu</span><span> took out a brush with a flick of his wrist and wrote the words &lsquo;Seven Realms Soul Forging Incense&rsquo; on the scroll. He then rolled up the scroll before standing up to look at the managerial elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;All right, you may tell me what&rsquo;s going on now,&rdquo; he said.</span></p></div>
