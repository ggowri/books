        <h1>Chapter 3267</h1>
        <div> - Sky Filled With Blood-red Lightnings<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Never would I have expected that Chu Feng&rsquo;s close combat abilities are actually this exceptional too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That child simply has no weaknesses.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, this is when Chu Feng&rsquo;s actual cultivation is weaker than Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s. Should the two of them have the same cultivation, then it would simply be&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With the same cultivation, who could possibly match him? Likely, only Linghu Hongfei would be able to defeat him, no?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Linghu Tiemian, who was renowned for his close combat skills, was actually no match for Chu Feng, the crowd began to spiritedly discuss the matter.<br>There were even people that felt that the only person among the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations that might be able to defeat Chu Feng with the same cultivation would be Linghu Hongfei. Apart from Linghu Hongfei, no one else would be able to contend against Chu Feng.<br>Hearing the discussions of the crowd, Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s expression grew even uglier. This was especially true after he heard that &lsquo;only Linghu Honfei would be able to defeat Chu Feng.&rsquo; Hearing that, Linghu Tiemian began to gnash his teeth with fury.<br>However, he did not say anything. Instead, he began to form hand seals single-handedly. Then, purple light began to radiate from his body.<br>Not only did the purple light completely cover Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s body, but it also covered the Dragon Phoenix Battle Edge that Linghu Tiemian held in his hand.<br>At that moment, space itself began to tremble violently. It was being shaken by the enormous might of the light.<br>The purple light grew brighter and brighter. Soon, it covered the entire region.<br>The sky, the earth and everyone present were all covered by the purple light.<br>&ldquo;That is&hellip; one of the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Protection Martial Skills, the Immortal Taboo: Glorious Golden Breaker!!!!&rdquo;<br>The crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed enormously the moment they recognized the martial skill Linghu Tiemian was using.<br>This was especially true for Dongguo Bingyu and the others that were worried about Chu Feng. At that moment, nervousness filled their faces.<br>They all knew very well what the martial skill Linghu Tiemian was using represented.<br>Not only was that martial skill one of the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s strongest Immortal Taboo Martial Skills, but it was also one of the strongest Immortal Taboo Martial Skills in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>There was no need to doubt its power.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, rumbles suddenly began to sound from the sky. Following that, many enormous blood-red lightning bolts began to strike down from the sky like blood-red lightning dragons. As for their target, it was Linghu Tiemian.<br>Seeing this, Linghu Tiemian shouted. Then, purple blade rays began to burst forth from his body repeatedly. Not only were the purple blade rays flying toward the blood-red lightning to slice them apart, but the great majority of them were actually aimed at Chu Feng.<br>However, like cages, the blood-red lightning dragons sealed Linghu Tiemian.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Everything happened too fast. The crowd was simply unable to tell what had happened. They only witnessed the sudden downstroke of blood-red lightning, and the scattering of purple blade rays that followed it. After that, they heard continuous explosions, and felt enormous might being swept out in all directions.<br>The might of their attacks was simply too strong. Even though Chu Feng and Linghu Tiemian had no desire to cause harm to the people present, the people on the honored guests&rsquo; viewing platform still received quite an impact from their confrontation.<br>The stronger experts among the crowd were merely blown several thousand meters away and left with minor injuries.<br>However, those that were weaker had their bodies completely bloodied and mutilated by the might of the energy ripples.<br>There were even people whose bodies were completely destroyed.<br>Fortunately this was the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm and they were protected by the grand protective formation. Otherwise, those whose bodies ended up being destroyed by the might of the energy ripples would&rsquo;ve had their souls completely shattered, and would fade away into death.<br>Although the people present were all still alive, the might of the energy ripples still left quite a psychological trauma on them.<br>At that moment, the crowd all had frightened looks. That said, they were still unable to keep themselves from turning their eyes back toward the battle between Chu Feng and Linghu Tiemian.<br>Upon doing so, they discovered that Chu Feng was still standing in midair with an unchanged expression. He was also completely unharmed.<br>However, Linghu Tiemian, on the other hand, was lying on the ground and vomiting blood repeatedly. His body seemed to be burned beyond recognition, and somewhat disgusting to look at.<br>Although Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s body was currently recovering, the crowd knew that the one who had ended up losing in the confrontation was Linghu Tiemian.<br>Even though Linghu Tiemian had used their Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Protection-level martial skill, he was still defeated by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, I truly can&rsquo;t dare to believe that Chu Feng actually defeated Linghu Tiemian!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What Chu Feng used earlier should be an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill, right? But&hellip; for it to be able to defeat even Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s Immortal Taboo: Glorious Golden Breaker, exactly what sort of Immortal Taboo Martial Skill was it?&rdquo;<br>The crowd began to exclaim in admiration at the martial skill Chu Feng had used earlier.<br>Their reaction was understandable. After all, Chu Feng&rsquo;s martial skill was truly exceptional.<br>After all, that Immortal Taboo Martial Skill, that Immortal Taboo: Blood Lightning Technique, was something that Chu Feng had obtained from the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain.<br>Although the Immortal Taboo: Blood Lightning Technique was something that Chu Feng picked up from the ground of the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain, it was currently the strongest martial skill in his arsenal.<br>The fact that the Immortal Taboo: Blood Lightning Technique was able to defeat the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Immortal Taboo: Glorious Golden Breaker served to prove how powerful the Immortal Taboo: Blood Lightning Technique was.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. Wahahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Linghu Tiemian stood up and started laughing wildly.<br>Had it been before, no one would have found it strange for Linghu Tiemian to laugh like that.<br>However, Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s current appearance was very miserable. For Linghu Tiemian to laugh like that at such a time; the crowd inevitably started to ponder if he might&rsquo;ve received too big of a shock, and had gone insane.<br>Right at that moment, Linghu Tiemian suddenly stopped his laughter. His gaze became extremely sharp.<br>He fixed his sharp and icy gaze at Chu Feng. With a cold voice, he said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you must be thinking that you&rsquo;ve won, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you&rsquo;re mistaken. You&rsquo;ve lost from the very start.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
