        <div> - Feeling Jealous<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Ehh&hellip; lil-little brother Chu Feng, w-we had no intention of attacking you, w-we were just, just&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing Chu Lingxi and Chu Feng, those few people immediately started panicking. They stammered as they tried to explain themselves.<br>Although they were deeply mocking Chu Feng earlier, it could be seen from their reactions that, deep down in their hearts, they were extremely afraid of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Because of Chu Yue?&rdquo; Right at that moment, a sneer was heard. It was Chu Haoyan.<br>It was not only Chu Haoyan who had walked over. Practically all the others that had participated in the Sacred Domain Selection walked over.<br>Apart from them were many other people that had not participated in the Sacred Domain Selection.<br>In fact, even Chu Huanyu and Chu Ruoshi were watching it all from a distance.<br>&ldquo;How could you not know whether or not it&rsquo;s because of Chu Yue?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked.<br>&ldquo;Humph, you&rsquo;re speaking as if that Chu Feng could do anything to me if it wasn&rsquo;t for Chu Yue.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With his cultivation, how could he possibly be a match for me? He knew very well that he would only bring about his own disgrace should he try to attack me. That is why he endured my insults. In fact&hellip; enduring my insults is all he&rsquo;s capable of doing,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan said his final sentence while pointing at Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng smiled lightly at Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s insult. It was a smile filled with contempt.<br>Seeing Chu Feng actually smiling so disdainfully, Chu Haoyao shouted angrily, &ldquo;The hell are you smiling at?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am smiling at you being so overly conceited that you don&rsquo;t even know that you&rsquo;re pitifully weak,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What did you say?! You dare call me weak?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come! Let the two of us go head-to-head and see exactly who is strong and who is weak!&rdquo; Chu Haoyan began to quickly walk toward Chu Feng as he spoke.<br>At the same time, he unleashed his rank seven True Immortal aura.<br>He was not joking around. He was really planning to attack Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, lightning suddenly started moving as black clouds filled the sky. Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s skirt shifted, and her hair fluttered. Like a raging fairy with the cultivation of a rank seven True Immortal, she arrived before Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, what is this? You&rsquo;re planning to protect this Chu Feng?&rdquo; Chu Haoyan asked.<br>He was feeling very surprised. He was surprised that Chu Lingxi, who refused to acknowledge anyone and seemingly never considered them her relatives, would actually stand up for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;To bully the weak is no ability at all. If you want to fight someone, you should fight someone with the same cultivation as your own. If you insist on fighting, why don&rsquo;t you fight with me?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>Once Chu Lingxi said those words, everyone present was surprised.<br>The always cold Chu Lingxi who never got along with anyone was really going to protect that Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Haoyan started to frown. He was afraid. While he might not be afraid of Chu Lingxi, he was definitely afraid of someone related to Chu Lingxi.<br>Thus, he did not accept Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s challenge. Instead, he looked to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, are you planning to hide behind a woman?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; right at that moment, Chu Ruoshi spoke.<br>Furthermore, as she spoke, she leaped. Like a celestial fairy, she descended between Chu Lingxi and Chu Haoyan.<br>At the moment she landed, the black clouds in the sky scattered. The lightning also gradually vanished. Even Chu Lingxi and Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s auras were dispersed.<br>It was suppression. Chu Ruoshi used her rank eight True Immortal-level strength to forcibly suppress both Chu Lingxi and Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s auras.<br>&ldquo;What happened here today shall be dropped at this moment. If anyone still insists on picking a fight, they must first pass through me, Chu Ruoshi,&rdquo; when Chu Ruoshi said those words, she deliberately took a glance at Chu Haoyan.<br>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan snorted coldly. Then, he took a step back. He knew that he would be no match for Chu Ruoshi.<br>&ldquo;In the end, I&rsquo;ve won,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan looked to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What have you won?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I exited the Death Gate first. Have you forgotten about our match?&rdquo; Chu Haoyan pointed at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Hah&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Feng laughed. His laughter was even more disdainful than his smile from earlier.<br>&ldquo;You still dare to laugh? What qualification do you possess to laugh? You are nothing more than a loser, what makes you think you can laugh?&rdquo; Rage burned in Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Very few people of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation dared to act in such a manner toward him. He was incapable of tolerating someone acting like this toward him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Haoyan, you should stop going too far. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that he stopped to help me, Chu Feng might not necessarily have lost to you,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>&ldquo;Help you?&rdquo; Chu Haoyan laughed mockingly. Then, he said, &ldquo;The way I see it, you were the one helping him, no? For the sake of helping him conceal his uselessness, you actually waited so long to come out. Chu Lingxi, you are truly capable. I truly have no idea what aspect of this Chu Feng is capable of attracting you so much, capable of making someone like you help someone like him.&rdquo;<br>There was a trace of jealousy in Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s tone as he said those words.<br>Although the people of the Chu Heavenly Clan all belonged to the same clan, there were many branch families. These branch families were capable of intermarrying with one another.<br>Chu Ruoshi and Chu Lingxi were the most outstanding young females in the Chu Heavenly Clan. Thus, they were the most optimal candidates for a spouse in the eyes of countless males, Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu included.<br>Unfortunately, Chu Ruoshi already possessed a childhood sweetheart. Although her childhood sweetheart&rsquo;s cultivation could not be considered to be top-notch among the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, the two of them possessed excellent affection for one another, and their marriage was practically determined since they were kids.<br>Because of this, Chu Lingxi became the most ideal candidate for the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation&rsquo;s males.<br>However, although Chu Lingxi was a weird person, she was also extremely cold, and would always keep her distance from others.<br>Because of that, the people all felt that was Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s personality.<br>However, Chu Lingxi was now actually protecting Chu Feng like that in front of them.<br>Not to mention Chu Haoyan, many of the younger generation&rsquo;s males were all feeling jealousy and even hatred toward Chu Feng.<br><br><br></p></div>
