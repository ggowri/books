        <h1>Chapter 4295</h1>
        <div> - Only Talent Mattered<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior, exactly what happened?&rdquo;<br>En route, Chu Feng was finally unable to contain himself from asking that question.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Shaoyu is in danger.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Only you can help him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He is challenging something.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What he challenged was something that tests one&rsquo;s talent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Only those with strong talent are able to challenge it. Right now, he is in mid-challenge. However, things are not looking good.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In this sort of situation, he needed someone to take on the danger together with him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are very talented. You are able to help him.&rdquo;<br>Lady Gusu did not attempt to conceal things and informed Chu Feng of the course of events.<br>While they&rsquo;re talking, they&rsquo;ve arrived at the entrance created by the case.<br>Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er who was guarding this place had disappeared.<br>But, Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s Life Talisman Paper was still present.<br>&ldquo;Crap!&rdquo;<br>Lady Gusu&rsquo;s expression changed enormously when she saw the Life Talisman Paper.<br>Originally, she went to find Chu Feng just in case things turned bad.<br>But, that Life Talisman Paper had already changed.<br>Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s life was evidently already in threat.<br>The thing Xianhai Gusu feared the most happened.<br>There was a need to question where Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er was. She must&rsquo;ve noticed that Xianhai Shaoyu was in danger and entered through the spirit formation gate to aid Xianhai Shaoyu withstand the power within.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I am to enter through this, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to the spirit formation gate and asked Xianhai Gusu for confirmation.<br>&ldquo;Right. It&rsquo;s this spirit formation gate,&rdquo; said Xianhai Gusu.<br>&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he walked over to the spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, wait.&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Gusu suddenly called out to him.<br>&ldquo;Senior, is there any other matter?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Xianhai Gusu was hesitant. But, in the end, she made a decision.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I must inform you of the truth of the matter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The power inside there is very terrifying. But, I do not know exactly how strong and what sort of power it is. All I can say is that it&rsquo;s very dangerous inside.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;By entering it, you might be able to withstand that power together with Shaoyu and return safely.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, it is also possible that you two might fail to withstand the power. Should that happen, you will also die in there&hellip;&rdquo;<br>In the end, Xianhai Gusu warned Chu Feng of the dangers.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please rest assured. I will definitely bring brother Shaoyu back safely.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled at Xianhai Gusu&rsquo;s warning.<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng turned around and stepped into the spirit formation gate.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng did not hesitate to enter knowing fully of how dangerous it was, Xianhai Gusu suddenly realized why Xianhai Shaoyu believed in Chu Feng this much.<br>She finally realized why he was willing to brave such dangers for Chu Feng.<br>&hellip;...<br>After passing through the spirit formation gate, Chu Feng entered a vast starry sky.<br>This was not a world he arrived in. Instead, it was the vast and boundless starry sky.<br>This was not a created world. Instead, it was the actual boundless starry sky. All the stars that were visible to Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes were different worlds.<br>Beautiful. The scenery of this place was truly beautiful. This was especially true for martial cultivators...<br>This boundless and mysterious starry sky made Chu Feng realize how small he was and how much he yearned for greater power.<br>But, at this moment, Chu Feng does not possess any desire to appreciate the beauty of this place.<br>The reason for that was because terrifying power had covered the sky above him like a boundless amount of black clouds.<br>There were frantic lightnings, surging winds, and boiling flames within the black clouds.<br>Those three different sorts of powers were all extremely terrifying. They seemed like the convergence of hundreds of millions of ferocious beasts spiraling above Chu Feng&rsquo;s head.<br>Merely by entering this place, Chu Feng felt enormous oppression.<br>That oppression came from above.<br>Although that terrifying power was gathering above him, it was spiraling like a vortex.<br>Chu Feng could sense that the oppression he felt from the above his head was merely the weakest extent of that terrifying power.<br>The deeper into it, the stronger the power will become.<br>Standing where he was, Chu Feng was unable to find Fumo Shaoyu&rsquo;s figure. But, he saw sight of Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was struggling as she tried to approach the terrifying vortex.<br>Even though she was still at the outermost region of the vortex, that power was already descending from the sky and attacking her.<br>The violent winds were coming down upon her. Like ferocious beasts, they pounded against Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s body repeatedly.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er swayed back and forth. She was unable to even stand firm. A moment of carelessness caused her to be suppressed to the ground by that power.<br>But, she immediately stood back up and once again struggled her way back toward the terrifying vortex.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was completely covered in cuts and bruises. Yet, she was only in the vicinity of the terrifying vortex and not inside it.<br>Even that terrifying violent wind that attacked her was only one of the three different kinds of powers.<br>Flame, wind and lightning. Only one of the three struck her.<br>Even for the wind, only a very weak subset of it came down at Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was still far from reaching the truly terrifying powers in the sky above.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was still very far away from the depths of that vortex.<br>But&hellip; it was clear that she was already on the verge of collapse.<br>&ldquo;Lord young master?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng immediately walked over to Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>But, as he walked closer to her, his expression changed.<br>As he approached, he was able to hear Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s voice.<br>She was clearly trying to rescue Fumo Shaoyu. Yet, she was shouting for &lsquo;lord young master&rsquo; the entire time.<br>This made Chu Feng suddenly realize that the relationship between Fumo Xin&rsquo;er and Fumo Shaoyu was not what he knew.<br>This included their so-called grandma. She seemed to be not as simple as Chu Feng imagined either.<br>There must be some sort of secret unknown to Chu Feng between them.<br>&ldquo;Lord young master, lord young master!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re unable to withstand it, please leave this place!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord young master!&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t know Chu Feng had arrived.<br>She was shouting with her all and trying to have Xianhai Shouyu hear her.<br>But, in this place, her powers were completely suppressed. It was so much that she shouted herself hoarse.<br>Because of that, she realized that her cultivation seemed to be completely useless in this place that relied on one&rsquo;s talent.<br></p></div>
