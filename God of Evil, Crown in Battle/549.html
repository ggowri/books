        <div> - Pulse Searching Method<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Big Brother Tianyi, how about you go call for Big Brother Chu Feng? The sky&rsquo;s going to be dark soon.&rdquo; Jiang Wushang said a bit worriedly.<br>&ldquo;Yeah! This time, you will all soon begin a long trek, so you must select a fortuitous hour and day for departure to obtain great fortune. It will truly be a shame if you were to let today&rsquo;s chance pass.&rdquo; In reality, even many other people started to feel anxious.<br>They had assembled there at dawn and prepared to send Chu Feng and the others off, yet now, the sun already started to set in the west, an entire day&rsquo;s worth of time passed.<br>At present, the sky was turning black right in front of their eyes, so naturally, they were slightly unable to remain still.<br>&ldquo;Ah Tianyi, go call for Chu Feng. Don&rsquo;t let everyone wait for him.&rdquo; Seeing all of that, the Azure Dragon Founder spoke as well.<br>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo; After he spoke, Zhang Tianyi also nodded his head.<br>*whoosh whoosh whoosh*<br>But just at that moment, from the direction of the main palace, three rainbows appeared abruptly. Those three rainbows first stormed straight into the sky, but quickly after, like meteors, streaked down, and at the end, landed in the center of the square.<br>After the three rainbows landed, they became three figures. When their faces could be seen clearly, all of the people at that place were taken aback.<br>Especially the ones who were close to Chu Feng. Even their mouths widened greatly, their faces showing ecstatic expressions quickly after<br>The three people were precisely Chu Feng, Su Rou, and Su Mei.<br>At that very instant, the two beauties, who had their own special traits, already wore the two skirts Chu Feng gifted to them. Their beauty was embellished by the Elite Armament skirts, making them appear even more bewitching.<br>As for Chu Feng, he stood in between the two of them, his two hands unrestrainedly over their soft<br>things<br>. He said to the crowd, &ldquo;Everyone, please excuse me, I&rsquo;ve come late.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little Rou, Little Mei, you&rsquo;re awake, you&rsquo;re awake!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, a middle-aged man suddenly dashed up to Su Rou and Su Mei, bawling with snot and tears. That person was none other than Su Rou and Su Mei&rsquo;s father.<br>&ldquo;This is great, this is great! Sisters, you two are finally awake!&rdquo; Quickly after, Su Rou and Su Mei&rsquo;s elder brother and his wife also ran over. Seeing their family, Su Rou and Su Mei were very touched as well.<br>In reality, seeing the two of them reawaken, those who recognized them were all very happy. No matter how they reawakened, from the bottom of their hearts, they felt happy for them and Chu Feng.<br>Of course, some were happy, and some were puzzled as well. After all, not everyone knew about Su Rou and Su Mei.<br>For example, Jiang Wushang. Currently, fog filled up his head, so he patted Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s shoulder and asked quietly, &ldquo;Big Brother Tianyi, who are these two beauties? Why do they seem so intimate with Big Brother Chu Feng? Even their cultivation isn&rsquo;t weak.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heh, I almost forgot. You still don&rsquo;t know about them.&rdquo; In regards to that, Zhang Tianyi smiled faintly, and then simply explained to Jiang Wushang the relationship between Su Rou, Su Mei, and Chu Feng, as well as what happened between them.<br>And after knowing everything, the gaze Jiang Wushang looked at Chu Feng with contained only one word: admiration. At the same time, he couldn&rsquo;t help exclaiming, &ldquo;Big Brother Chu Feng, your luck with beauty runs deep!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah, Chu Feng! The time is late. It is better to depart early.&rdquo; The Azure Dragon Founder had no choice but to urge them as he saw the sun, which already descended halfway down the western mountains.<br>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo; Hearing that, Chu Feng nodded his head, then quickly after, went up to Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang, and said, &ldquo;Senior Zhang, Brother Wushang, Little Rou and Little Mei also want to head to the Eastern Sea Region along with us. Can they?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course they can.&rdquo; Without even thinking Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang nodded their heads and agreed.<br>Jiang Wushang even took the initiative to open the Elite Armament chariot&rsquo;s door, pulled Chu Feng into it, and said to him, &ldquo;Big Brother Chu Feng, this Elite Armament is not for battle, but for journeying. There is no difference between this and a palace. Not only is its speed strangely fast, it is very comfortable living inside as well.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s exactly three rooms in here. The biggest room over there was originally for my own use because I like sleeping on large beds, but now, I&rsquo;ll give it to you. Hehe, relish it well! Hehehe...&rdquo; As his voice faded away, a hint of lasciviousness even appeared on the corners of Jiang Wushang&rsquo;s mouth as he smiled.<br>Chu Feng calmly smiled as he faced Jiang Wushang who acted like that, then said in a low voice, &ldquo;Brother Wushang, good job.&rdquo;<br>Thus, just like that, Chu Feng, Su Rou, Su Mei, Zhang Tianyi, and Jiang Wushang, the five of them, rode on that Elite Armament chariot, and departed from the continent of the Nine Provinces, heading towards the Four Seas Academy in the Eastern Sea Region.<br>&ldquo;I truly don&rsquo;t know what accomplishments these children will achieve in that sea region.&rdquo; Seeing the Elite Armament chariot that disappeared on the horizon in a blink, the Jiang Dynasty&rsquo;s old ancestor felt rather despondent.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. These children&rsquo;s abilities all surpass me by a huge margin. Even if it&rsquo;s the Eastern Sea Region, they will definitely have a certain amount of achievements.&rdquo; The Azure Dragon Founder calmly smiled and said.<br>Hearing the Azure Dragon Founder&rsquo;s words, everyone also smiled relievedly. It was really not only he who had such thoughts, but everyone as well.<br>Elite Armaments. At the end, it&rsquo;s still a tool, so if one wants it to move, they must use their cultivator&rsquo;s power to spur it forward. The stronger the power of the one who spurs it, the speed it moves becomes quicker.<br>This Elite Armament is the same. In order to more quickly reach the Eastern Sea Region and arrive at the Four Seas Academy, it required the circulatory propulsion of Chu Feng and the others, constant travelling through day and night.<br>However, because of the special relationship between Chu Feng and Su Rou and Su Mei, Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang themselves requested the mission of urging the Elite Armament forward to be covered by them two. It would be sufficient for Chu Feng to put his focus on accompanying Su Rou and Su Mei well.<br>At first, Chu Feng still felt rather bad. After all, the road was far. Chu Feng really felt ashamed to let only the two of them drive the Elite Armament forward.<br>But when he saw Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang&rsquo;s firm stance, Chu Feng gave up, and at the end, said only a sentence.<br>Good brothers need no explanation.<br>So, Chu Feng was able to concentrate on being with the two sisters Su Rou and Su Mei and enjoy the beautiful scenery on the road while being in the Elite Armament. That feeling of happiness really made Chu Feng feel extreme rapture.<br>However, when it was deep in the night, when all of them should have been asleep, a scene that Chu Feng could do nothing about occured.<br>Chu Feng, who was initially lying perfectly fine on the bed next to the sisters, was heartlessly kicked onto the ground by Su Rou. Moreover, she flashed a warm smile, then said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Before marriage, don&rsquo;t even think of committing immoral acts towards me and my sister.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little Rou, don&rsquo;t do this! The ground is cold!&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s face was filled with appeal, but as it did nothing to Su Rou, he could only cast his pleading gaze towards Su Mei.<br>However, Su Mei also sweetly smiled, and said &ldquo;She&rsquo;s right&rdquo; before quickly pulling down the canopies, thoroughly excluding Chu Feng from the large bed.<br>&ldquo;Sigh.&rdquo; Seeing the canopies that already blocked his vision, Chu Feng sighed helplessly, but very quickly, his face brimmed with a hint of a joyful smile.<br>In reality, Chu Feng had never planned to commit any indecent acts to Su Rou and Su Mei. The two of them, being able to cheerful jump around in front of him, Chu Feng already felt content.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, right now, you are already a Blue-cloak World Spiritist, and you are also going to enter the Eastern Sea Region. I think it&rsquo;s time to teach you the Pulse Searching Method.&rdquo; But just as Chu Feng closed his eyes and prepared to sleep, Eggy&rsquo;s voice suddenly rang out.<br></p></div>
