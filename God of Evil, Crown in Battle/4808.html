        <h1>Chapter 4807</h1>
        <div>: A Difficult Opponent<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t reply to Zuoqiu Youyu&rsquo;s taunt, but that wasn&rsquo;t because he was afraid. Instead, he directed a disdainful smile in his direction which further pissed Zuoqiu Youyu off.<br>More and more people gathered in the area. At the very end, all of the elders and disciples stood up and bowed deeply.<br>The vice sectmaster and sectmaster had arrived.<br>The sectmaster rarely showed herself in public, and the fact that she was making an appearance here showed just how much she cared about this matchmaking convention. There was no way she wouldn&rsquo;t since she was trying to find a spouse for Zi Ling here.<br>However, what the crowd didn&rsquo;t know was that the matchmaking convention was actually hosted by no other than the vice sectmaster. The vice sectmaster then began to announce the rules to the convention.<br>Basically, all participants were given a chance to challenge the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple, and the priority was given to the higher-ranking disciples. Under this set of rules, Zuoqiu Youyu was allowed the first go.<br>It was just that the mysterious Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple hadn&rsquo;t shown himself yet, and this left the crowd confused. Was the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple so arrogant that he wasn&rsquo;t willing to show himself when even the sectmaster was already here?<br>If the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple never appeared, what would become of the convention? Was this considered as forfeiting his participation rights?<br>The crowd couldn&rsquo;t help but speculate about the possibilities.<br>Of course, given that the sectmaster was present, they only dared to speculate through voice transmission. The spectator stand was filled with massive crowds by now, but hardly anyone dared to speak up carelessly now that the sectmaster had arrived.<br>Weng!<br>It was finally time for the challenge to start.<br>A layer of energy suddenly appeared around the combat ring. It was a barrier.<br>This barrier seemed to be present right from the start as it appeared in whole, only to dissipate right after. This hinted that the barrier was simply hidden from sight all along.<br>Along with the dissipation of the barrier, a figure came into appearance. He was lying on the stage of the combat ring, and his appearance immediately caught the crowd&rsquo;s attention.<br>Without a doubt, he was the mysterious Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple.<br>The crowd scanned him intently from head to toe, but they weren&rsquo;t able to figure anything from him. He was wearing the robe of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple, but he was wearing a mask and a hat that was specially crafted to prevent detection too, making it impossible to make out his appearance.<br>What was worth noting was that the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple was extremely short, shorter than an average man.<br>Of course, no one really cared about his height. The crowd was intrigued as to why the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple would be so determined to keep his identity under wraps, refusing to show his true face even at this juncture.<br>They were also curious to know why he was lying on the ground.<br>However, when they took a closer look, they realized that there was a snoring sound coming from the combat ring, right from the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple.<br>Due to the mask, the crowd couldn&rsquo;t tell whether his eyes were opened or closed, but the snoring sound was getting clearer to them.<br>Is he asleep? He arrived early here just so that he could sleep on the combat ring?<br>Everyone was dumbfounded.<br>At this point, Zuoqiu Youyu rose from his seat and stepped onto the combat ring.<br>&ldquo;I am Zuoqiu Youyu. I&rsquo;ll be challenging you for the title of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple,&rdquo; Zuoqiu Youyu clasped his fist and said.<br>However, the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple continued snoring, not responding to Zuoqiu Youyu at all. He was still asleep!<br>This left Zuoqiu Youyu in a difficult spot. He was extremely displeased to be made light of. However, he didn&rsquo;t make a move recklessly. He turned to his grandfather, who was hosting this convention, to seek his opinion.<br>&ldquo;It has already begun.&rdquo;<br>The vice sectmaster&rsquo;s words clearly told Zuoqiu Youyu what he ought to do.<br>&ldquo;Pardon me.&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Youyu clasped his fist once more before a crackling sound echoed from him.<br>He activated the Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor simultaneously, causing his cultivation to rise from rank three Martial Exalted level to rank five Martial Exalted level. He dared not to get careless here, choosing to face the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple at his peak state.<br>At the same time, he whipped out a silver sword that extended over ten thousand meters.<br>This sword was a true Exalted Armament, giving off the domineering aura of a conqueror. It was of even higher quality than Zuoqiu Yanliang&rsquo;s Shattered Sword.<br>As expected of the most outstanding junior of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Even the treatment Zuoqiu Youyu was accorded was the best in the sect.<br>However, Zuoqiu Youyu didn&rsquo;t make a move right away.<br>Bam!<br>He stabbed the Exalted Armament into the combat ring, seemingly not intending to use it directly. Instead, he channeled his oppressive might toward the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple like a furious flood.<br>The oppressive might of a rank five Martial Exalted level cultivator was definitely terrifying, but it was so directed that only the ones on the combat ring could feel it. Those on the spectator stand was unable to sense how destructive it was.<br>If Zuoqiu Youyu&rsquo;s oppressive might hadn&rsquo;t been targeted, he could have easily laid devastation on his surroundings.<br>Yet, this oppressive might seemed to be nothing more than a breeze to the Hidden Draogn Chief Disciple. It was unable to faze him at all, not even shaking his robe.<br>&ldquo;Some kind of energy is protecting him.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had been keeping a close eye on the battle, and he was certain that there was a layer of energy wrapped around the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple. That was also the reason why his robe didn&rsquo;t move in the least before the powerful oppressive might.<br>This resulted in an awkward sight.<br>Despite Zuoqiu Youyu already making his move, the snoring sound still continued. The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple was still sleeping!<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>Zuoqiu Youyu&rsquo;s face darkened. He picked up his Exalted Armament and swung it toward the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple&rsquo;s body.<br>Shoosh!<br>He was intending to sever the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple into two!<br>Boom!<br>There was a massive explosion as the Exalted Armament clashed with the body of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple. Shockingly, it was as if the sword had collided with some sort of indestructible object, resulting in a massive explosion.<br>Despite this powerful attack, the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple remained unharmed! The indestructible object was his seemingly weak body!<br>Zuoqiu Youyu was infuriated. He charged forward with the Exalted Armament in hand. It seemed like his mind had already been clouded with rage, eroding his composure.<br>He had been using long-ranged attacks thus far, thinking that it would be better to probe the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple to assess his means first instead of going all-in. However, now that fury had overtaken his rationality, he charged right in with his Exalted Armament, aiming his sword at the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple&rsquo;s throat.<br>Shoosh!<br>It was then that the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple finally moved. His hand rushed forth and grabbed Zuoqiu Youyu&rsquo;s Exalted Armament, halting the latter&rsquo;s attack easily.<br>&ldquo;Strong!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had been looking at the happenings on the combat ring intently, but he wasn&rsquo;t able to clearly discern the movements of the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple at all. He didn&rsquo;t see the latter&rsquo;s hand move at all; all he saw was the outcome.<br>The Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple was simply too powerful that Chu Feng felt greatly pressured with just this one simple move.<br>Duan Liufeng wasn&rsquo;t lying to him. This was indeed an opponent he would struggle to defeat.<br></p></div>
