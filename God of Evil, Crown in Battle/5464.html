        <h1>Chapter 5464: A Talisman to Change the World</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clan had a secret art that allowed the parents to pass down their bloodlines to their offspring so as to strengthen their offspring&rsquo;s bloodline, but the cost of utilizing this secret art was death.</span><br><span>This secret art was deemed to be a forbidden art that couldn&rsquo;t be used unless in the case of an exceptional situation.</span><br><span>While exploring an ancient remnant, Long Muxi and Long Chengyu&rsquo;s mother caught a terrifying curse that destroyed her face and subjected her to hellish pain. The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief tried engaging the help of experts, but not even the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion could help her.</span><br><span>Unable to bear the pain, Long Muxi and Long Chengyu&rsquo;s mother decided to end her misery by dying. She didn&rsquo;t want her death to be in vain, so she decided to use the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s secret art to pass her bloodline down to Long Chengyu.</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief eventually accepted her decision and went ahead with it.</span><br><span>However, Long Muxi wasn&rsquo;t informed of it in advance. By the time she learned about the matter, her mother was already a cold corpse. She was angry at her father for giving up on her mother as she thought that there had to be a way out. She also didn&rsquo;t think that Long Chengyu should have accepted their mother&rsquo;s bloodline.</span><br><span>She knew that their mother was a strong person, which made her believe that their mother wouldn&rsquo;t have given up on her life if Long Chengyu adamantly refused her bloodline.</span><br><span>However, it was already too late for &lsquo;what ifs&rsquo;.</span><br><span>Long Muxi could neither forgive her family nor forget her sorrow, so she chose to break away from the Totem Dragon Clan. Long Suqing was afraid that a mishap might happen to her, so she chose to leave together with her.</span><br><span>However, the truth was that Long Suqing had never truly left the Totem Dragon Clan. She had only left with Long Muxi in order to protect her.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Did Long Chengyu know that his mother was going to use the secret art on him?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Our Totem Dragon Clan has forbidden the use of the secret art, but we don&rsquo;t consider it to be an unorthodox means. For the secret art to work, both sides have to cooperate with each other. Should one side refuse, the secret art will end in failure. However, I should say that Chengyu had his difficulties too. He wasn&rsquo;t greedy for his mother&rsquo;s bloodline; he just didn&rsquo;t want her to suffer anymore,&rdquo; Long Suqing explained.</span><br><span>Chu Feng had a good idea as to what was going on now.</span><br><span>Long Muxi truly wanted her mother to survive the ordeal, and she didn&rsquo;t think that they should have given up as long as there was still a sliver of hope. Given how the path of cultivation was endless, there was bound to be a way to resolve her mother&rsquo;s curse.</span><br><span>On the other hand, Long Chengyu must have seen the torture his mother was put through, and he didn&rsquo;t want to see her suffer anymore. That prompted him to accept her bloodline.</span><br><span>If what Long Suqing said was true, Long Chengyu would be the one who had sacrificed more in this matter. How much courage would it have for him to allow his mother to die for him?</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, what do you want me to do?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Our entire Totem Dragon Clan hopes for Muxi to come to terms with that incident and return to us. This is a chance. I hope that young friend Chu Feng can help counsel </span><span>Muxi,&rdquo; Long Suqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try talking to her, but I&rsquo;ll only do it once. I won&rsquo;t force her if she refuses to listen to me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good enough. I can tell that she listens to you. I&rsquo;ll be counting on you, young friend Chu Feng,&rdquo; Long Suqing said before leaving the room.</span><br><span>Shortly after Long Suqing left, Eggy said, &ldquo;Do you really intend to talk to her about that? There&rsquo;s nothing messier in the world than family grudges.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I can tell that Miss Muxi and Long Chengyu care deeply for each other, and I don&rsquo;t think that any of them have done wrong in this matter. They are just torturing each other right now. I wish to help them,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;All right then,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>While Chu Feng had decided to counsel Long Muxi on this matter, he didn&rsquo;t dive into it right away. He thought that it would be better for him to wait for an opportune time.</span><br><span>Soon, the group reached their destination. What appeared before them wasn&rsquo;t a realm but vast space.</span><br><span>Chu Feng was awed.</span><br><span>Other than the dark expanse of space and distant starlight, he saw a majestic dragon with a size so huge that it was almost impossible to describe. This dragon was a realm in itself, the base of the Totem Dragon Clan. It was also a powerful formation capable of offense and defense.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What incredible means!&rdquo; Chu Feng exclaimed. A moment later, he remarked in bewilderment, &ldquo;Why do I sense the aura of the Ancient Era here?&rdquo;</span><br><span>It was very faint, but he could sense the aura of the Ancient Era. Considering how the Totem Dragon Clan was founded after the Ancient Era, this formation should have been constructed after the Ancient Era too. It was perplexing that it carried hints of the Ancient Era.</span><br><span>Intrigued, Chu Feng tried examining the formation using his Heaven&rsquo;s Eye.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, your eyes are frighteningly sharp. To think that you&rsquo;re actually able to sense the aura of the Ancient Era!&rdquo; Long Chengyu exclaimed.</span><br><span>Most people wouldn&rsquo;t have sensed the aura of the Ancient Era inside the formation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Was an Ancient Era&rsquo;s treasure used in the construction of the formation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re able to even deduce that?&rdquo; Long Suqing was astonished.</span><br><span>Even Long Kuitian&rsquo;s eyes lit up in admiration upon hearing those words.</span><br><span>It was apparent from Chu Feng&rsquo;s stable voice that he wasn&rsquo;t just making blind guesses. There were likely reasons behind his deduction. However, a world spiritist of his level shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to sense the aura of the Ancient Era inside the formation.</span><br><span>In a sense, this showed how outstanding Chu Feng was.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Am I right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>He did notice some clues through his Heaven&rsquo;s Eye, which was why he made such a deduction.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Many years ago, the founder of our Totem Dragon Clan invited two of </span><span>the strongest world spiritists in his era to construct this formation. The formation they created was impressive, but it was nowhere as formidable as what you&rsquo;re seeing.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Later, the fourth clan chief of our Totem Dragon Clan acquired a world spiritist treasure inside an ancient remnant. The world spiritist treasure was a talisman capable of enhancing the effects of a formation. While he was aware that the talisman is no ordinary treasure, he didn&rsquo;t expect it to actually elevate the formation to this extent,&rdquo; Long Suqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;A single talisman actually possesses this much power?&rdquo; Chu Feng was amazed.</span><br><span>Once again he felt how insignificant he was. How powerful must the creator of the talisman be to make something like that?</span><br><span>&ldquo;Interestingly, the talisman&rsquo;s creator has quite a humble name,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You know the name of the talisman&rsquo;s creator?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, the talisman&rsquo;s creator left his name behind.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Qin Jiu,&rdquo; Long Chengyu replied.</span><br></p></div>
