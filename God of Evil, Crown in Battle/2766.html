        <div> - Looking For Trouble<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><br>While this woman was exceptionally beautiful, she was not amiable or approachable.<br><br>Even though she clearly had the title plate of the Chu Heavenly Clan on her waist, the other Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations present were keeping their distance from her. It was as if they were scared of her.<br><br>That being said, Chu Feng was able to sense that the woman&rsquo;s aura was very strong, stronger than even Han Yu&rsquo;s aura.<br><br>If Chu Feng guessed correctly, that woman should be a rank seven True Immortal.<br><br>Among the members of the younger generation present, this woman&rsquo;s strength surpassed everyone else.<br><br>&ldquo;Chu Lingxi! It&rsquo;s actually Chu Lingxi! Heavens, I have truly not come here in vain! I actually managed to see two of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s Three Great Beauties!&rdquo;<br><br>At that moment, Li Xiang cried out in alarm. He was so excited that his body started shaking.<br><br>Through Li Xiang&rsquo;s cry of alarm, Chu Feng realized the woman&rsquo;s identity.<br><br>She was Chu lingxi, the person ranked ninth on the Demon-level Geniuses List. Both her father and grandfather possessed great authority within the Chu Heavenly Clan. As for her mother, she was another Upper Realm&rsquo;s princess.<br><br>Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s background could be said to be extremely powerful. In the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, existences like her could be counted with one&rsquo;s fingers.<br><br>&ldquo;Lingxi, it has been close to two years now. We finally meet again.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I never would&rsquo;ve expected you to make such rapid progress. You&rsquo;re actually a rank seven True Immortal already. Since you&rsquo;re a rank seven True Immortal, it would appear that your ranking on the next Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition will increase quite a bit.&rdquo;<br><br>Han Yu spoke to Chu Lingxi. His attitude was very eager and attentive. It was the same sort of attitude he spoke with Xia Yun&rsquo;er with.<br><br>However, Chu Lingxi did not even bother to glance at Han Yu. Instead, she stared at Xia Yun&rsquo;er and said, &ldquo;You are Xia Yun&rsquo;er?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I am Xia Yun&rsquo;er. It is my pleasure to meet Miss Lingxi,&rdquo; With a smile on her face, Xia Yun&rsquo;er curtsied toward Chu Lingxi.<br><br>&ldquo;As the Holy Daughter of the Starfall Holy Land, do you not even know the most fundamental rules? Is Miss Lingxi something you can use to address me?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said coldly.<br><br>While she had a very pure appearance, she was extremely tyrannical when she spoke.<br><br>&ldquo;In that case, how should I address you?&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er asked in a slightly confused manner.<br><br>&ldquo;Address me as Lady Lingxi,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br><br>&ldquo;Xia Yun&rsquo;er pays her respects to Lady Lingxi,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er immediately went along with Chu Lingxi and courteously addressed her as Lady Lingxi.<br><br>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi looked to Han Yu coldly.<br><br>&ldquo;Han Yu pays his respects to Lady Lingxi.&rdquo;<br><br>With a smile on his face, Han Yu courteously paid his respects to Chu Lingxi. Compared to Xia Yun&rsquo;er, his behavior was even more natural. It was as if there was no trace of shame in his actions at all, as if this were something natural.<br><br>However, even though Han Yu was so eagerly attentive, Chu Lingxi barely even bothered to glance his way.<br><br>Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s body shifted. She had actually leaped to the peak of the palace hall and sat on the enormous lampstand. She said, &ldquo;I am going to rest. All of you, be quiet when you speak. If anyone is to wake me up, I will remove their head.&rdquo;<br><br>After she finished saying those words, Chu Lingxi actually used her two arms as pillows and laid down.<br><br>At that moment, the vast palace hall became exceptionally quiet. Even though people were speaking, they were doing so through voice transmissions. No one dared to make any sounds.<br><br>From this, it could be seen that Chu Lingxi was a ruthless character. Else, she would not possess such a strong deterrence.<br><br>Even though the crowd did not dare to let out any sounds, they still quietly arrived before Chu Feng and the others. They all wanted to get close to Xia Yun&rsquo;er. Of course, there were also people who wanted to befriend Chu Feng.<br><br>While Xia Yun&rsquo;er was very cordial toward Chu Feng, she was still very distant when talking to others.<br><br>Her coldness was different from that of Chu Lingxi. Chu Lingxi was someone who revealed her coldness right on her face.<br><br>As for Xia Yun&rsquo;er, she continued to have a charming smile on her face the entire time. Although she seemed to be as beautiful as a celestial fairy and very approachable, one would be greatly mistaken if one were to think that she was truly approachable.<br><br>All of the people in the palace hall who tried to greet her were ignored by her. Even those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were no exception.<br><br>It could be said that ever since Xia Yun&rsquo;er entered the vast palace hall, Chu Lingxi was the only one that had managed to converse with her.<br><br>That being said, Chu Feng was not as cold and detached as Xia Yun&rsquo;er. He would greet all those who tried to greet and converse with him. This was especially true for the people from the Immortal Armament Villa. Chu Feng was exceptionally cordial toward them.<br><br>After all, Chu Feng felt that it was all thanks to the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master that he had managed to get here at all. Thus, he felt that he owed the Immortal Armament Villa a favor.<br><br>Through his conversations with them, Chu Feng came to find out why they were all gathered there.<br><br>It turned out that it was not that they did not wish to climb the mountain. Rather, they were not allowed to do so by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan.<br><br>Because of this, that Chu Lingxi even became furious. In the end, it was only after the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief personally came to explain to her that she would definitely not miss the time of the Buried Spirit Lake&rsquo;s eruption that Chu Lingxi calmed down.<br><br>Thinking about the attitude the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had toward the Starfall Eight Immortals and the attitude he had toward Chu Lingxi, Chu Feng felt that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was not completely fearless either.<br><br>Else, it shouldn&rsquo;t be possible for him to personally come and appease Chu Lingxi.<br><br>If he didn&rsquo;t fear offending the Starfall Eight Immortals, then he most definitely feared offending Chu Lingxi.<br><br>This was understandable too. After all, the Chu Heavenly Clan was the fully deserving overlord of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br><br>Moreover, Chu Lingxi was not an ordinary Chu Heavenly Clansman. She was someone with an enormous background.<br><br>Not to mention the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, it was likely that very few people in the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm would dare to provoke Chu Lingxi.<br><br>After a series of conversations, someone asked Chu Feng while looking at Chu Feng&rsquo;s glass ball, &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, how come you all were already holding glass balls in your hands when you entered this place?&rdquo;<br><br>At that moment, they were no longer conversing with one another through voice transmissions. Instead, they were openly chatting with each other. Merely, because they were afraid of bothering that tyrannical Chu Lingxi, they all lowered their voices when they were speaking.<br><br>&ldquo;Where did you all obtain your glass balls?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br><br>&ldquo;We only received our glass balls after entering this palace hall. Reportedly, if we are to instill our spirit power into the crystal balls, we will be able to change their color. The color that our glass ball change into was said to be able to give us clues and increase our chances at reaching Buried Spirit Lake.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;That being said, we do not know exactly what is going on either,&rdquo; Someone said.<br><br>After hearing those words, Chu Feng and the others realized that the people here most likely did not know about the maze formation, or the fact that it would not be that easy to reach Buried Spirit Lake this year.<br><br>Right at that moment, Yuwen Tingyi suddenly said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, they all say that your world spirit techniques are extraordinarily impressive. However, your performance today was only barely satisfactory.&rdquo;<br><br>Chu Feng merely smiled at Yuwen Tingyi&rsquo;s mockery, and did not bother to answer.<br><br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, please don&rsquo;t misunderstand me. I, Yuwen Tingyi, am not trying to ridicule you.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Actually, I believed in your strength greatly. Merely, I do not understand why you&rsquo;ve failed to display your strength properly today, and actually only managed to change your glass ball&rsquo;s color to cyan,&rdquo; Yuwen Tingyi said.<br><br>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s something that you want to say, just say it directly,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br>&ldquo;Very well. Since that&rsquo;s the case, I will say it directly. I actually wish to swap pointers against you,&rdquo; Yuwen Tingyi said.<br><br>&ldquo;How do you wish to swap pointers?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br><br>Chu Feng knew very well that Yuwen Tingyi was deliberately trying to make things difficult for him. Furthermore, it was very likely by Han Yu&rsquo;s instructions.<br><br>However, Chu Feng simply did not fear them.<br><br>If they really thought that cyan glass ball was his, then they would suffer miserably.<br><br><br>Check out the June Giveaway for a chance to win $200, $100 or $50 Visa Gift Card<br><br></p></div>
