        <h1>Chapter 3701</h1>
        <div> - The Greatest Love<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng immediately rushed to support Gu Mingyuan.<br>At the same time, he released his spirit power and began to treat her injuries.<br>Upon beginning his treatment, he discovered that Gu Mingyuan was extremely weak, and her soul was not only scalding, but was also extremely chaotic. It seemed like her soul was on the verge of scattering.<br>An expert like Gu Mingyuan was actually on the verge of death.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Then, more spirit power appeared and enveloped Gu Mingyuan.<br>It was Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, Chu Feng, how did Mingyuan become like this?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa walked over.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s face was covered in blood. It was an injury caused by Gu Mingyuan pushing him away earlier.<br>However, he did not bear any grudge against her. Instead, he was extremely worried about her condition.<br>&ldquo;She ignited her soul,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Ignited her soul?!&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s expression immediately changed upon hearing those words.<br>As a martial cultivator, how could he not know how dangerous it was to ignite one&rsquo;s soul? That was simply an act akin to suicide.<br>Thus, he immediately asked, &ldquo;Why did she do that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s most likely some sort of special method that could increase her speed by igniting her soul.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, she wouldn't have caught up to us this quickly after setting off for the Mirror Sea later than us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Likely, she learned about what happened to your daughter upon returning to the Chu Heavenly Clan. For the sake of your daughter, she disregarded her life to chase after us,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa felt enormous pain. With a &lsquo;putt,&rsquo; he fell on his knees. Tears mixed with the blood on his face.<br>Chu Feng had known Chu Xuanzhengfa for a long time, and knew that he was a man of steel.<br>Even when the crusading army composed of ten thousand martial cultivation experts came to crush the Chu Heavenly Clan, even when the Blood-devouring Hall wanted to exterminate the Chu Heavenly Clan, Chu Xuanzhengfa did not cower in the slightest, and did not shed a single tear.<br>However, in the recent days, Chu Feng was no longer able to remember how many times Chu Xuanzhengfa had cried.<br>That said, only two people were able to cause Chu Xuanzhengfa to tear up.<br>One was his daughter, Chu Lingxi.<br>The other was his wife, Gu Mingyuan.<br>Regardless of whether or not Gu Mingyuan recognized Chu Xuanzhengfa as her husband, Chu Feng was able to tell that Chu Xuanzhengfa loved her deeply.<br>&ldquo;Mingyuan, why are you so foolish?&rdquo;<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa arrived before Gu Mingyuan again. Pain and grief filled his tear-filled eyes.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s extended hand stopped before coming in contact with Gu Mingyuan. He did not dare to touch her.<br>Seeing Chu Xuanzhengfa like that, Chu Feng sighed in his heart, &lsquo;Senior, are you not foolish yourself?&rsquo;<br>Chu Feng still remembered what Chu Xuanzhengfa said without any hesitation when Grandmaster Liangqiu mentioned that Chu Lingxi needed new eyes.<br>For the sake of his daughter, he was willing to lose his own eyes.<br>Remembering Chu Xuanzhengfa at that time and seeing Gu Mingyuan, who had ignited her soul in order to chase after them out of worry for Chu Lingxi, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart was deeply moved.<br>If love truly existed in the world, then the greatest love of them all would be paternal and maternal love.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>As the situation was urgent, Grandmaster Liangqiu immediately handed the task of treating Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s injury to Chu Feng after stabilizing her condition.<br>Then, bringing Chu Feng and the others along, he began to search for that old friend of his.<br>Although the Mirror Sea appeared to be tranquil like a mirror, the sky above it would rain year round without stopping for a single day.<br>However, there was a straw hut in such a poor environment.<br>That straw hut was very small, and appeared to be very frail. Normally, with the amount of rainfall present in the Mirror Sea, such a straw hut should be destroyed instantly.<br>However, that straw hut was standing above the sea beneath the black clouds. Although it was bombarded by rain and wind, not a single piece of straw was blown away. It was so tenacious that it seemed miraculous.<br>That straw hut was the residence of Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s friend.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s friend was a mysterious person.<br>Although Grandmaster Liangqiu had known him for many years, he still didn&rsquo;t know his name. All he knew was that that mysterious person was surnamed Zhu.<br>There were many hidden experts in the martial cultivation world. Although these people were not known to the public, they were very powerful.<br>In Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s impression of all the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s hidden experts that he knew, this friend of his who would stay in the Mirror Sea year-round was the strongest of them all.<br>Zhu was not only an Utmost Exalted, but he was also already a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist by the time Grandmaster Liangqiu had met him.<br>Although everyone in the Ancestral Martial Starfield would say that Grandmaster Liangqiu was the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s strongest world spiritist, only Grandmaster Liangqiu himself knew that the Zhu fellow hidden in the Mirror Sea was the actual strongest world spiritist in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>For a hidden expert that powerful, his residence would naturally not be a simple straw hut.<br>Although all of the rain was landing on the straw hut, there was actually a layer of spirit formation outside the straw hut.<br>Although that spirit formation did not affect the weather, it was capable of isolating martial cultivators.<br>That was a spirit formation cast by a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Ordinary people were simply unable to pass through it, much less discover the hidden expert surnamed Zhu.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, several figures ignored that spirit formation and arrived before the straw hut.<br>They were naturally Chu Feng, Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others.<br>After being treated by Chu Feng, Gu Mingyuan had regained consciousness. Although she was still very weak, she was awake.<br>Only Chu Lingxi was still unconscious...<br>&ldquo;We are truly fortunate. That old codger is actually here.&rdquo;<br>After passing through the spirit formation, joy appeared on Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s face.<br>What he feared the most was his old friend not being there. After all, this old friend of his rarely stayed in the straw hut, and instead spent the majority of his time immersed in the Mirror Sea. Furthermore, every time he left the straw hut, he would spend at least half a month inside the Mirror Sea. On longer occasions, he would even be gone for several years.<br>At that moment, they were there to seek him pit with an urgent matter. Thus, they could be said to be extremely lucky that he was inside the straw hut.<br>&ldquo;Liangqiu, why did you bring strangers here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Have you forgotten about our agreement?&rdquo;<br>A voice sounded from the straw hut. Not only was this voice ice-cold, but it was also filled with displeasure. It simply did not sound like a voice of someone welcoming one&rsquo;s old friend.<br>&ldquo;Brother Zhu, I know that you do not like to be disturbed. But, I truly have no choice but to disturb you today. I truly hope that you can help us,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;What matter do you need my help with?&rdquo; asked the person inside the straw hut.<br>&ldquo;I wish to know the location of the Deepsea Pupils,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Deepsea Pupils? How could I reveal the location of something so precious to others?&rdquo; said the person in the straw hut.<br>&ldquo;Brother Zhu, this is a matter of life and death. Please take me into consideration and help us,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of life and death for someone else, not you,&rdquo; said the person inside the straw hut.<br>&ldquo;Quickly reveal where the Deepsea Pupils are or else I will tear down this hut of yours!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a furious shout was heard. It was Gu Mingyuan.<br>Gu Mingyuan was very short-tempered to begin with. Furthermore, the matter concerned the life and death of her daughter.<br>For the sake of Chu Lingxi, Gu Mingyuan was willing to ignite her soul to chase after her. As such, she would naturally not be willing to waste time.<br>Everyone knew that Gu Mingyuan was not making a threat. She was really planning to do what she declared.<br>However, right after Gu Mingyuan said those words, Grandmaster Liangqiu was immediately terrified. Not only did he begin to give her meaningful looks, but he even sent voice transmissions to her urging her to calm herself.<br>The reason for that was because Grandmaster Liangqiu knew that this friend of his was the archetype of someone who was amenable to coaxing, but not coercion.<br>&ldquo;Is this the attitude of someone requesting another&rsquo;s help?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well. I shall see how you&rsquo;re going to tear down my hut.&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, the person inside the house showed no fear of Gu Mingyuan. Instead, his voice was filled with contempt.<br>He did not place Gu MIngyuan in his eyes at all.<br>When had the confident and arrogant Gu Mingyuan ever encountered such contempt?<br>Chu Feng was able to see fury surging in Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s eyes. In fact, he could even sense a faint killing intent emitting from her.<br>The current Gu Mingyuan was akin to an active volcano that could erupt at any moment.<br>Should she erupt, things would get out of hand. None of them would be able to stop her.<br>In this sort of situation, Chu Feng, Chu Xuanzhengfa and Grandmaster Liangqiu were all extremely nervous.<br>They were extremely afraid that Gu Mingyuan would become violent. Disregarding whether or not the person inside the hut was really only amenable to coaxing but not coercion, it remained that that person was Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s friend.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu going through such hardship to bring them there was already an act of great benevolence and righteousness.<br>If Gu Mingyuan decided to attack his friend now, it would be extremely disrespectful toward Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Unfortunately, they all knew that Gu Mingyuan was someone that could not be contained.<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a muffled sound was heard.<br>In the next moment, Chu Feng, Chu Xuanzhengfa, and Grandmaster Liangqiu were all stunned.<br>They were astonished to discover...<br>&hellip;that the insufferably arrogant Gu Mingyuan was actually kneeling on the ground!!!<br></p></div>
