        <h1>Chapter 5737: You’re My Pride</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people were dressed in silver armor that emanated unique auras that seemed to counteract the energy lingering within the realm. Chu Feng recognized all of these people, for they were the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Ling Clan Heaven Crushing Army!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the group were Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> and Ling Yunhao.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Hoh! Chu Feng, you actually came at the last moment. I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t be coming. Thanks to that, our wait wasn&rsquo;t in vain,&rdquo; Ling Yunhao said with a relieved smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> also eyed Chu Feng as if he was prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people had been the ones to befriend Chu Feng when he entered the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but they were now looking at him with different eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like you have succeeded. With the armor, you were able to overcome the age restriction on this place,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that none of the people in front of him were juniors, though they weren&rsquo;t particularly old either. It was likely thanks to the silver armor they wore that they were able to get in here. That was what the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Heaven Crushing Army had been working on all this while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just that Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that they would use it on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, we&rsquo;re at least acquainted. I suggest you surrender so that we won&rsquo;t have to make a move on you,&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> said as she tossed out a binding formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Chu Feng stepped into the binding formation, he would be immediately tied up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You should also know that I&rsquo;ll be a goner if I&rsquo;m captured by the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You deserve it,&rdquo; Ling Yunhao replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;So, we&rsquo;re putting aside our past ties here?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was giving them one last chance&mdash;Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> wouldn&rsquo;t be a match for him despite being at Immortal Dragon God-cloak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Past ties? Hahaha!&rdquo; Ling Yunhao burst into laughter. The others sneered too. &ldquo;Tell me, what past ties do we have? It was under our elder&rsquo;s instruction that we befriended you. He told us that you might have a bright future ahead of you. But you brazenly turned against our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Do you expect us to show you mercy after what you have done?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those from the Ling Clan Heaven Crushing Army thought that everything was within </span><span>their control. Little did they know they had just sealed their fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh </span><span>shoosh</span><span> </span><span>shoosh</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Chu Feng was about to make his move, several formation swords flew out and pierced Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> and the others&rsquo; bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd turned over and saw a person standing in the distance. It was another familiar figure&mdash;the Jie Clan Heaven Crushing Army&rsquo;s commander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Jie Feng?&rdquo; Chu Feng was confused as to what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Jie Feng, are you out of your mind?!&rdquo; Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> and the others glared at Jie Feng in incomprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;People who know not of gratitude deserve to die,&rdquo; Jie Feng replied as a vicious glint flashed across his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He changed his hand seal, and another wave of formation swords flew forth and claimed Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> and the others&rsquo; lives. He stowed away their bodies before tossing Chu Feng a Cosmos Sack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng took the Cosmos Sack and saw that it was filled with precious herbs. There was also a map inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Protection formations are useless here. Given your cultivation, it&rsquo;s best for you to tread carefully here,&rdquo; Jie Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;W-why?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you remember Lord Shuang Xue?&rdquo; Jie Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Shuang Xue? I do remember her,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, during his search for Life Crystals, he visited a Divine Inheritance Ground under the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s control and got acquainted with Ling </span><span>Sheng&rsquo;er</span><span> and the others. Shang Xue and Shuang Yu were experts whom the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion had stationed there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Shuang Xue and Lord </span><span>Nianqing</span><span> know you&rsquo;re Lord Jie </span><span>Ranqing&rsquo;s</span><span> child, just that Lord </span><span>Nianqing</span><span> is unable to meet you due to several reasons. Lord Shuang Xue has been looking for you. She learned that you joined the entrance examination, so she had me make contact with you and bring you to the Seven Stars Gravity Towers,&rdquo; Jie Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that Chu Feng realized that Jie Feng had intentionally lured him there to obtain the protection formation. Looking back on it now, Jie Feng hadn&rsquo;t done anything that harmed him despite all his taunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I misunderstood you. Your acting was too convincing,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;All of us have received Lord Jie </span><span>Ranqing&rsquo;s</span><span> grace too, so you need not thank me. I&rsquo;m just doing what I should,&rdquo; Jie Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng realized it wasn&rsquo;t just Jie Feng but Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> and the others who had received Jie </span><span>Ranqing&rsquo;s</span><span> grace, or else Jie Feng wouldn&rsquo;t have phrased it in such a manner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, head to the place indicated by the map once the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith is over. Lord Shuang Xue is waiting for you there. She&rsquo;ll protect you,&rdquo; Jie Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder Shuang Xue can&rsquo;t protect me, and I don&rsquo;t need protection either. I don&rsquo;t plan on hiding anymore,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Shuang Xue will be waiting for you, whether you go or not.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you know where my mother is?&rdquo; Chu Feng was more concerned about his mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Jie Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo; It was confidential information, so it made sense that it would be kept from the other clansmen. &ldquo;Tell Elder Shuang Xue not to wait for me. I can protect myself well. It&rsquo;ll suffice for you to take care of yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng raised his Cosmos Sack and said, &ldquo;Thanks for this.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rose into the air and ventured deeper into the realm, thus commencing the trial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jie Feng looked at the disappeared Chu Feng with a conflicted look. He could tell from the latter&rsquo;s speed of travel that he was extremely strong, so much so that he could have dealt with Ling </span><span>Xinian</span><span> and the others by himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made him laugh in self-derision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Lord Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span>, you&rsquo;d be proud if you knew how outstanding your son is,&rdquo; Jie Feng remarked with a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who cleared the test would be brought into another realm&mdash;the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The test was difficult, but it wasn&rsquo;t to an extreme extent. Those who had at least reached rank one Half-God level or White Dragon God-cloak and possessed decent talents were able to clear the test, so there were quite a few people gathered in the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were either outstanding prodigies from powerhouses or the strongest juniors in their respective regions, though they looked shabby in comparison to top-notch prodigies like Ling Xiao, Qin Xuan, </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span>, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn&rsquo;t just renowned prodigies who drew attention here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, the five </span><span>Huangfus</span><span> who entered the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith ahead of everyone else. They cleared the test even faster than </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span>, which left many curious about whether they were the real deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was also curious about the Divine Body Galaxy&rsquo;s Wang Qiang and the Nine Souls Galaxy&rsquo;s Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span>, though most people doubted the credentials of Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn&rsquo;t believe that a prodigy could emerge from the Nine Souls Galaxy and the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, and they thought that the prodigies of those places were weaklings who couldn&rsquo;t even match their subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of them were prepared to challenge Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> when she appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just that there were many places in the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith they couldn&rsquo;t access. For instance, each challenger had their own spirit realm to serve as their accommodation. Others couldn&rsquo;t enter their spirit realm unless they invited them over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, none of them had seen Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> thus far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Xian </span><span>Miaomiao</span><span> from the Nine Souls Galaxy, get out here if you have guts! Let me see if you truly have the right to enter the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith!&rdquo; a woman suddenly howled.</span></p></div>
