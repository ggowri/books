        <div> - Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Actually, it was not only Chu Huanyu who noticed Chu Feng, Xia Yun&rsquo;er and Elder Xingyi when they arrived, practically everyone present noticed them.<br>Chu Lingxi smiled faintly at Xia Yun&rsquo;er and Chu Feng. Immediately afterward, she turned her head around as if she didn&rsquo;t know them. She was as proud as ever.<br>As for the others from the Chu Heavenly Clan, they ran over to greet them. Merely, the people that they were greeting were Xia Yun&rsquo;er and Elder Xingyi.<br>After they greeted Xia Yun&rsquo;er and Elder Xingyi, the great majority of them did not bother to pay attention to Chu Feng. Just like that, they ignored Chu Feng.<br>It was actually the strongest person among them, Chu Ruoshi, that looked at Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;You must be Young Master Chu Feng, right?&rdquo;<br>Not only did she speak to Chu Feng, but her tone was also very gentle. While she gave off an extraordinary air and enormous aura, her smile was rather good-natured. It was as if she did not possess any arrogant airs at all. She gave off a very amiable and approachable feeling.<br>&ldquo;I am indeed Chu Feng,&rdquo; faced with Chu Ruoshi&rsquo;s courtesy, Chu Feng also replied courteously.<br>&ldquo;Young Master Chu Feng, I am Chu Ruoshi. It is my pleasure to meet you,&rdquo; Chu Ruoshi said.<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, am honored to be able to meet Miss Chu here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Right at the moment when the two of them were greeting one another, two other people walked into the pocket realm.<br>Those two people were familiar faces. They were the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Jinshi Bo and that Supreme Elder.<br>The first person Jinshi Bo noticed upon entering this place was Chu Feng. He immediately glared at Chu Feng fiercely. He seemed to be cursing at how unlucky he was to encounter Chu Feng here, of all places.<br>However, when his gaze landed on Xia Yun&rsquo;er, Chu Ruoshi and Chu Lingxi, those Three Great Beauties, his eyes immediately started shining. It was as if he had completely forgotten that he had just lost ten million Immortal Martial Stones to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xia, you&rsquo;re also here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wow, young lady, you are truly beautiful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Could it be that you&rsquo;re the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Miss Chu Ruoshi?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, wouldn&rsquo;t that young lady be Miss Chu Lingxi?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Jinshi Bo, am truly fortunate today. I actually managed to meet all three of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s renowned Three Great Beauties on my first trip to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Miss Chu Ruoshi, I am Jinshi Bo. I am the three hundred and seventy-fifth prince of the Goldenstone Royal Clan. I have come here today precisely to meet you,&rdquo; Jinshi Bo spoke with a radiant smile on his face as he ran his eyes over Chu Ruoshi and Chu Lingxi.<br>He was not only looking at Chu Ruoshi and Chu Lingxi, but he was also looking at Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>His gaze was an extremely comparative gaze. It seemed as if he were comparing which of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s Three Great Beauties was more beautiful.<br>Faced with such a Jinshi Bo, not to mention a proud girl like Chu Lingxi, even a good-natured woman like Chu Ruoshi only revealed a faint smile, and did not bother to talk to him excessively.<br>However, Jinshi Bo started to circle around Chu Ruoshi, Xia Yun&rsquo;er and Chu Lingxi, and was talking nonstop.<br>Chu Ruoshi and Xia Yun&rsquo;er took the situation at hand and Jinshi Bo&rsquo;s status into consideration. Thus, they only dealt with this annoyance vaguely .<br>However, Chu Lingxi possessed no such patience to deal with someone like Jinshi Bo. When Jinshi Bo approached her, Chu Lingxi immediately narrowed her long, shapely brows and said a single word to him, &ldquo;Scram.&rdquo;<br>Once she said that word, the entire crowd turned quiet. Even Jinshi Bo was standing there in a stunned manner.<br>That Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder also revealed a displeased expression.<br>However, he knew that Chu Lingxi was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s young miss.<br>Thus, even though he was feeling displeased, he did not dare to act blindly without thinking. Not to mention directly attacking her like he did with Song Yunfei, he did not even dare to utter a fart.<br>The reason for that was because he knew very well that while they were both the overlords of an Upper Realm, their Goldenstone Royal Clan was much inferior to the Chu Heavenly Clan in terms of strength.<br>Furthermore, they were presently in the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory. As such, how could they dare to behave atrociously?<br>Jinshi Bo seemed to also understand this. Thus, after being stunned momentarily, he suddenly had a bright idea. He smiled and said, &ldquo;Miss Lingxi is truly a lady with personality. This is the first time I have witnessed a greeting like yours. You are truly different.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you to get away from me. Do not make me say it again,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said with a serious expression. After she finished saying those words, she cast her gaze toward the auction hall&rsquo;s main auctioning platform and no longer bothered to look at Jinshi Bo.<br>At that moment, Jinshi Bo still had a smile on his face. Merely, that smile of his was somewhat awkward.<br>&ldquo;Haha, that little girl Chu Lingxi is truly interesting. Her temperament resembles my own. This Queen likes her,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen started to clap her hands as she took joy in Jinshi Bo&rsquo;s calamity.<br>&ldquo;Little girl? You look even younger than her, yet you have the nerve to call her a little girl?&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Her Lady Queen.<br>&ldquo;What are you saying? How is this Queen little?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen immediately revealed a proud expression on her face upon hearing those words. She even deliberately pushed her chest forward.<br>It really must be said that Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s enchanting curves were not little at all.<br>Chu Feng coughed. &ldquo;I meant to say that you are much more beautiful than Chu Lingxi. Milady Queen is the most beautiful. Long live Milady Queen!&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>After being ruthlessly cursed by Chu Lingxi, Jinshi Bo had quieted down by a lot.<br>Soon, the grand auction assembly officially began.<br>It turned out that the auctioneer for the Grand Auction Assembly was also a familiar face. He was Old Man Gui Chou.<br>There were also ten youthful and beautiful women that followed Old Man Gui Chou onto the stage.<br>Those ten women possessed both figure and face. Likely, they were beauties meticulously selected by the Ghost Sect Hall.<br>When those ten beauties appeared on stage, many young men&rsquo;s gazes gathered on them.<br>However, to Chu Feng and the others, those ten women did not possess any enticement.<br>After all, the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s Three Great Beauties were gathered beside them. Even though those ten women were decent-looking, they were much inferior when compared to the Three Great Beauties.<br>Thus, Chu Feng and the others&rsquo; gazes were all gathered on the trays held by the ten women.<br>On those trays should be the first set of goods to be auctioned.<br>Unfortunately, the cloth that covered the trays possessed the ability to block off all sorts of observation abilities. Thus, no one was able to see through them.<br>Old Man Gui Chou greeted the crowd courteously. Immediately afterward, he got to the main subject, and began to introduce the goods that would be auctioned.<br>&ldquo;The first item that is to be auctioned today originates from the Ancient Era. I believe many people have heard of its name before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is called the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet,&rdquo; Old Man Gui Chou said.<br>&ldquo;Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The legendary Divine Artifact from the Ancient Era, that Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet, actually appeared in an auction?&rdquo;<br>Once Old Man Gui Chou said those words, the entire auction hall burst into an uproar. In fact, even the expressions of the crowd beside Chu Feng started to change.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xia, what is that Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;Young Master Chu Feng, the things of the Ancient Era are too distant. They are like secrets covered in dust. We know very little about them.<br>&ldquo;However, there are still some legends.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;One such legend states that there were a lot of Divine Artifacts in the Ancient Era. As for that Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet, it is one such Divine Artifact.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Reportedly, the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet contains an unexplainable power. It is capable of forcibly instilling cultivation into cultivators to allow a martial cultivator&rsquo;s body to transform and become stronger.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even people that are incapable of cultivating will soon become cultivators upon entering the Metamorphosis Mysteryrealm Bracelet. In fact, they might even become exceptional experts,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually that miraculous?!&rdquo; Chu Feng was shocked upon hearing those words.<br>This was simply going against the natural path of martial cultivation. It was truly miraculous.<br><br><br></p></div>
