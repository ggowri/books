        <h1>Chapter 1667</h1>
        <div> - Victor And Loser<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Step~~&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng suddenly turned around with a smile on his face which caused even Du Wanwu to be shocked. He did not understand what Chu Feng&rsquo;s intention was, and thus he immediately stopped his movements. He wanted to carefully observe Chu Feng.<br>Upon closer inspection, his expression took a huge change.<br>He discovered that lightning was suddenly flickering in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes. Then, Chu Feng&rsquo;s<br>Lightning<br>Armor and<br>Lightning<br>Wings appeared on his body.<br>Lightning<br>Armor and<br>Lightning<br>Wings were very vivid and lifelike. Furthermore, they were formed with orange, purple, red, black, blue, and gold, six different colored types of lightning.<br>Each lightning bolt possessed its own shape. It was as if they possessed independent lives. It was very strange, yet powerful.<br>Being covered by this sort of powerful aura, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation instantly went from rank one Half Martial Emperor to rank three Half Martial Emperor.<br>Furthermore, this was not all there was. With a flip of his palm, his Incomplete Imperial Armament Infinity Edge appeared in his hand.<br>At the same time, a layer of crimson gaseous flames began to appear unceasingly. It was very terrifying.<br>At this moment, Du Wanwu&rsquo;s pupils shrunk. He had noticed that the situation was bad. He had sensed fatal danger from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the situation was bad, Du Wanwu&rsquo;s body shot back explosively.<br>However, Chu Feng did not give him the opportunity to escape. He brandished the Infinity Edge in his hand and shouted,<br>&ldquo;Earthen...Taboo:...Firmament...Slash!!!!!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Three consecutive slashes shot forth explosively with rapid speed. At such a close distance, Du Wanwu was simply unable to dodge them in time.<br>&ldquo;Boom, boom, boom!&rdquo; Three loud explosions sounded, and heaven and earth began to shake violently. Energy ripples surged forth nonstop. All three of the slashes Chu Feng had cast landed directly on Du Wanwu.<br>Chu Feng had decided to use a fatal attack the moment he attacked. What he planned to do was launch a surprise attack to prevail over his opponent!!!<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief!!!&rdquo;<br>The Poison Demon&rsquo;s descendants were all frightened by this scene. Unable to contain themselves, they shouted worriedly.<br>They were all able to sense how frightening Chu Feng&rsquo;s earlier attack had been. Likely, even Du Wanwu would find it very difficult to resist that attack.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at this moment, a loud explosion sounded once again. A layer of green gaseous flames was actually emitting out from Du Wanwu&rsquo;s body. The green gaseous flames began to sweep forth into his surroundings.<br>At the moment when the green gaseous flames started to dissipate, a very powerful aura suddenly appeared.<br>Du Wanwu reappeared before everyone. At this moment, not only was he completely undamaged, there were also green gaseous flames lingering around him. Those green gaseous flames were very frightening and possessed a fatal aura.<br>At this moment, the green gaseous flames were revolving around Du Wanwu in layer upon layer, like soldiers waiting for orders as they protected him.<br>At this moment, with his entire body being covered with green gaseous flames, Du Wanwu&rsquo;s eyes actually also turned a dark green color. As for his aura, it had gone from rank four Half Martial Emperor to rank five Half Martial Emperor.<br>At this time, he did not appear to be human at all. Instead, he looked like a demon god from hell.<br>&ldquo;It would seem that there will be a fierce battle today,&rdquo; Facing the current Du Wanwu, Chu Feng realized that the situation wasn&rsquo;t good.<br>He knew that Du Wanwu had used his Divine Power. Not only had he unleashed his Divine Power, Du Wanwu had also increased his cultivation by one level through the use of his Divine Power.<br>Du Wanwu was now a rank five Half Martial Emperor. On top of that, he possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. As such, his actual battle power was capable of contending against ordinary rank eight Half Martial Emperors.<br>As for Chu Feng, even though he possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, he only had the cultivation of rank three Half Martial Emperor. Thus, he was only able to contend against ordinary rank seven Half Martial Emperors.<br>In this sort of situation, Chu Feng would not be a match for Du Wanwu. However, Chu Feng would not give up. The reason for that was that if he gave up, he would definitely be killed. However, if he continued fighting, he might be able to live.<br>Thinking of this, Chu Feng began to brandish the Infinity Edge in his hand again.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>As crimson light flashed, the Firmament Slash&rsquo;s fourth slash, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth slashes were all unleashed!!!<br>Chu Feng shot forth the slashes in succession. Even space was shattered by Chu Feng&rsquo;s slashes, turning into darkness. The only things that were present in this darkness were Chu Feng&rsquo;s crimson slashes and Du Wanwu&rsquo;s green gaseous flames.<br>The Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash could be said to be the strongest martial skill that Chu Feng currently grasped. Especially the ninth slash, its extremely frightening might was comparable to that of Heaven Taboo Martial Skill.<br>When the ninth slash was unleashed by Chu Feng, the Poison Demon&rsquo;s descendants all paled with fear. They began to step back repeatedly. They were all extremely worried for Du Wanwu, fearing that he would would be killed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s slash.<br>In fact, the defensive barrier formed by Du Wanwu&rsquo;s Divine Power was broken through by Chu Feng&rsquo;s ninth slash. However, Du Wanwu was not wounded. He stood there completely undamaged.<br>Chu Feng was able to clearly see that there was a layer of green light covering Du Wanwu&rsquo;s body. That should be a special sort of defensive martial skill. Likely, it was an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill that was stronger than ordinary Earthen Taboo Martial Skills. Otherwise, it would be impossible for its defense to be this strong, and capable of withstanding Chu Feng&rsquo;s Firmament Slash&rsquo;s ninth slash.<br>However, regardless of how he had done it, Du Wanwu had managed to withstand Chu Feng&rsquo;s strongest slash.<br>&ldquo;You actually possess a battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, something that is even stronger than mine. What is your name?&rdquo; Du Wanwu spoke. Evidently, he was shocked by Chu Feng&rsquo;s powerful strength.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Very well, I will not kill you. I will instead refine you alive and turn your strength into my own,&rdquo; Du Wanwu said.<br>&ldquo;Heh, if you want to refine me, you must first demonstrate that you have the ability to do so.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, with a thought, the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique, Black Tortoise Armor Technique, Azure Dragon Dashing Technique, Vermillion Bird Revival Technique, and the Water Immortal Profound Technique, these five different supreme secret skills, were all unleashed at once.<br>The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermillion Bird, and Black Tortoise, the Four Great Secret Skills, fused together with Chu Feng and increased his battle power sharply.<br>As for the Water Immortal Profound Technique, it was even more amazing. It turned into an independent body and stood before Chu Feng. Furthermore, when it appeared, it created strong gales that caused heaven and earth to change, releasing wave upon wave of surging water. It had taken the initiative to unleash a torrential rainstorm-like attack at Du Wanwu.<br>&ldquo;This sensation, could it be that they&rsquo;re secret skills? You have actually grasped five secret skills?!!&rdquo;<br>Du Wanwu was no fool. He was able to sense how powerful Chu Feng&rsquo;s current strength was. Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation was only that of a rank three Half Martial Emperor, he really possessed the ability to fight against him.<br>&ldquo;Ever since my birth, there has never been anyone that could make me feel this way.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You, you have made me feel this sensation of itching to defeat you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come! Chu Feng, allow me to experience exactly how powerful you are!&rdquo;<br>However, faced with Chu Feng that had revealed his five secret skills, Du Wanwu was not only unafraid, but he was also instead incomparably excited and overflowing with the desire to battle.<br>As he shouted, green gaseous flames surged forth in wave upon wave as they charged toward Chu Feng.<br>In an instant, the entire horizon was completely occupied by the green poison gas and Chu Feng&rsquo;s secret skills.<br>The people below were simply unable to see the details of their battle. The only thing that they were capable of sensing was the aura that caused even their souls to tremble.<br>After an entire hour, the curtain to the battle finally dropped. When the violent energy ripples stopped surging, when the energies in the sky stopped dancing, Chu Feng and Du Wanwu&rsquo;s silhouettes finally reappeared. The victor and the loser of this battle were also revealed.<br></p></div>
