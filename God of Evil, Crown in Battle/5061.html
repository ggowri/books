        <div>: Incorrect Prophecy<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jiang Yuantai could still remember the tournament that had shaken the entire Totem Galaxy. That was a tournament to determine the greatest prodigy, attracting all of the top-notch prodigies of the Totem Galaxy together to fight it out.<br>Even someone like Jiang Yuantai could only watch from the spectator stand, unable to step onto the dueling ring himself.<br>The popular champion pick for that tournament was none other than the young master of the Totem Dragon Clan, Long Chengyu.<br>Long Chengyu&rsquo;s birth had induced a phenomenon. It was such a powerful phenomenon that it shook the entire Totem Galaxy. It was unprecedented even for the powerful Totem Dragon Clan. The speed of his growth was also amazing, creating numerous legends in the Totem Galaxy.<br>However, just as Long Chengyu was about to clinch the title of the strongest prodigy, a person suddenly stood in his path. That person arrogantly accused Long Chengyu of infiltrating the Immortal Sea Galaxy and severing his older brother&rsquo;s right arm. He said that he was here to exact vengeance, but out of respect for the Totem Dragon Clan, he would let Long Chengyu off with just severing his right hand.<br>With those words, that person stepped onto the dueling ring.<br>The crowd initially thought that the person was just humiliating himself. After all, Long Chengyu had just defeated all of his rivals with an absolute advantage in all of his battles.<br>Yet, to everyone's astonishment, that person actually defeated Long Chengyu and severed his right arm in public. More importantly, he actually managed to safely make his escape despite having injured the young master of the Totem Dragon Clan in public.<br>That incident shook the entire Totem Galaxy.<br>That person was none other than the young master of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>Jiang Yuantai had personally witnessed just how formidable Xianhai Shaoyu was back then. Just recalling the sight made his heartbeat hasten, and cold sweat would start dripping from his forehead.<br>That was the airs of the strongest prodigy of the Northern Region. Everything else seemed to pale in comparison to him.<br>Thinking about Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s terrifying prowess, he had no choice but to concede that it would be difficult for his younger brother, Jiang Kongping, to catch up with him.<br>&ldquo;Kongping, this is God&rsquo;s Era we&rsquo;re talking about. Even if you can&rsquo;t become the supreme existence, you should at least make a name for yourself here. You should also be aware of our father&rsquo;s current plight. We have all been expelled from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect.<br>&ldquo;My talent is limited, so it wouldn&rsquo;t mean anything no matter how hard I work. You&rsquo;re the only one who can restore our father&rsquo;s honor,&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai said.<br>&ldquo;I know, big brother. I don&rsquo;t think that I stand a chance at becoming the supreme existence you speak of, and honestly, I&rsquo;m not really interested in making a name for myself in God&rsquo;s Era either. However, I&rsquo;ll make the Pill Dao Immortal Sect understand that they have made a fatal error by expelling us from the sect,&rdquo; Jiang Kongping spoke resolutely.<br>A heartened smile surfaced on Jiang Kongping&rsquo;s face.<br>Ling ling ling!<br>All of a sudden, the ringing of a bell echoed from Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s right sleeves. Jiang Yuantai quickly rolled up his sleeves, revealing a bangle around his wrist.<br>The bangle contained a blue gemstone and a rusty copper bell. The bell was moving on its own accord despite the absence of wind, and its ringing was growing louder with each passing moment.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai murmured with an uneasy frown.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Jiang Kongping hurriedly asked.<br>He had never seen such an uneasy expression on Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s face before. He wondered if the ringing of the bell was an ominous omen.<br>&ldquo;This bangle was given to me by one of our father&rsquo;s old friends in the Seven Realms Galaxy, Daoist Starseizer,&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai said.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Starseizer? Is that the disciple of the World Spiritist Immortal King?&rdquo; Jiang Kongping asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai replied with a nod.<br>&ldquo;I heard that Daoist Starseizer is proficient in the art of prophecy. Could this be some sort of prophecy medium?&rdquo; Jiang Kongping eyed the bangle around Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s wrist and asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s indeed a prophecy medium. Our father couldn&rsquo;t make it here due to some urgent business, so he asked Daoist Starseizer to make a prophecy and see if we&rsquo;ll be able to achieve our goals here.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Starseizer gave this bangle to me, saying that it would give me a hint when the time is right. If the gemstone lights up, it means that we&rsquo;ll be able to obtain the legendary Soul Fog without any mishaps. However, if the bell rings instead, it means that we won&rsquo;t be able to obtain the Soul Fog. Instead, we should leave the Nine Souls Galaxy as soon as possible,&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai said.<br>&ldquo;Surely not? This mission doesn&rsquo;t look that dangerous to me.&rdquo;<br>Jiang Kongping was skeptical about that.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Starseizer is known for the accuracy of his prophecies, so there&rsquo;s some credence to his words. It looks like we&rsquo;ll have to make a decision soon.&rdquo;<br>Jiang Yuantai looked at the furiously ringing bell around his wrist with deepening worry in his eyes.<br>Kacha!<br>Cracks suddenly started forming on the copper bell, and before long, it shattered into countless fragments with a loud bam. However, instead of falling to the ground, these fragments started glowing and floating in mid-air. They scattered around to form a mirror that reflected two individuals.<br>One of them was Jiang Yuantai. He was lying on the ground, severely injured.<br>The other person had a leg crushing down on Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s chest as he pointed a sword toward his neck. That was clearly the pose of a victor.<br>Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s face paled at that sight, but he kept his eyes on the other person reflected in the projection. He wanted to know to whom he had lost.<br>The appearance of the other person was initially a little blurred, but the image gradually sharpened until it was finally identifiable.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo; Jiang Kongping blurted out.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng? He&rsquo;s the person who defeated you?&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai asked.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, you heard about that too?&rdquo; Jiang Kongping asked with a lowered head.<br>&ldquo;Of course I did. I never thought that trash from the Eastern Region would actually be able to defeat you and hold you hostage.&rdquo;<br>Jiang Yuantai let out a sigh.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is indeed a formidable opponent. He possesses incredible means that allow him to easily defeat any rank eight Martial Exalted level cultivator. It would take a rank nine Martial Exalted level cultivator to put up a fight against him.<br>&ldquo;But why would such a scene appear from the shattered copper bell? Is it prophesying a battle between you and him? Does this mean that you aren&rsquo;t able to defeat him too?&rdquo;<br>Jiang Kongping looked at Jiang Yuantai worriedly.<br>He knew how strong Jiang Yuantai was. Under normal circumstances, the latter shouldn&rsquo;t have lost to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Daoist Starseizer told me that if the copper bell shatters, it&rsquo;ll reveal the person who is going to stand in our way. It&rsquo;s just that&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t think that person who would pose the biggest threat to us would actually be a mere junior from the Eastern Region.&rdquo;<br>The fragments of the shattered bell had already dissipated by now, but Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s mind was still filled with the scene that had appeared earlier. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel deeply indignant.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, should we tell Jiang Taibai about this? Let&rsquo;s have him decide whether we should stay or leave,&rdquo; Jiang Kongping said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that. It&rsquo;d be one thing if anyone else appeared on the copper bell, but why should I fear a mere Chu Feng? Putting aside the fact that Jiang Taibai and the others are here, I should be able to defeat him easily with my strength. Even if Chu Feng doesn&rsquo;t dare to appear before me, I&rsquo;ll still seek him out and exact vengeance for you!&rdquo;<br>Jiang Yuantai spoke with great conviction.<br>Clearly, he felt insulted by the prophecy and wanted to prove himself.<br>Jiang Kongping burst into laughter upon seeing his older brother&rsquo;s reaction.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, you don&rsquo;t believe in the prophecy? Didn&rsquo;t you mention earlier that Daoist Starseizer&rsquo;s prophecy is credible?&rdquo; Jiang Kongping said with a chuckle.<br>He personally didn&rsquo;t believe in prophecies, but he knew that Jiang Yuantai believed in them.<br>&ldquo;I admit that Daoist Starseizer&rsquo;s prophecies tend to be quite accurate, but there are times when his prophecies are off too. Not to mention, the one that is making a prophecy here is this bangle, not Daoist Starseizer himself. The fact that it took this bangle so long in order to come up with a prophecy shows that it&rsquo;s lacking in power&hellip; I think that there are grounds to believe that Daoist Starseizer&rsquo;s prophecy is off this time around,&rdquo; Jiang Yuantai said confidently.<br>He was oblivious to the fact that Chu Feng, Wang Yuxian, and the others had finally returned to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan through an ancient teleportation formation. Behind them were thousands of towering silhouettes standing in a neat formation as if soldiers.<br>They were the puppet army that Chu Feng and Wang Yuxian had brought over from the Monstrous Spirit Clan!<br></p></div>
