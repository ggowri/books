        <div> - Made No Sense<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Truth be told, after learning that the backing of the Wuming Clan was actually that powerful, Chu Feng had thought about a lot of things.<br>He seemed to understand why his father had been unwilling to have a complete falling-out with the Wuming Clan back then.<br>He felt that it must because his father knew that they were backed by the colossal Blue Talisman Clan.<br>After all, back then, Chu Xuanyuan hadn&rsquo;t yet entered the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s forbidden area to train. His cultivation must not have been as powerful as it was later on.<br>Furthermore, he was also being pursued by the colossal Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.<br>In order to remain hidden, he had chosen to keep a low profile.<br>That said, it was clear to Chu Feng that the Blue Talisman Clan was not completely unreasonable.<br>At the very least, the conditions proposed by Lanfu Longping was very modest.<br>It was so modest that Chu Feng found himself somewhat incapable of understanding why he would propose such a condition.<br>Lanfu Longping clearly seemed to be trying to talk things over with Chu Feng.<br>But, with their strength, there was clearly no need for a discussion.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng felt that the situation was rather fishy.<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s slight hesitation, Lanfu Longping asked, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, is my condition to your satisfaction?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph, you speak pleasantly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, if it wasn&rsquo;t for me being here today, the Chu Heavenly Clan would&rsquo;ve been razed to the ground already.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re saying that you do not possess any malice, and are seeking peaceful coexistence? Who would possibly believe that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I instead feel that you all are only saying such pleasant-sounding words because your strength is insufficient. Your goal is to escape and wait for reinforcements. Once your reinforcements arrive, your attitude will no longer be the same,&rdquo; Bai Liluo suddenly spoke.<br>She did not believe in Lanfu Longping&rsquo;s guarantee.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, everything this old man has said is the truth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe me, I am able to prove myself,&rdquo; Lanfu Longping said to Bai Liluo.<br>&ldquo;Very well, why don&rsquo;t you prove yourself to me then,&rdquo; Bai Liluo spoke with an expression that showed clear distrust.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Bai Liluo&rsquo;s words left her mouth&hellip; the surrounding space started trembling.<br>No large disturbance had been created, yet the expressions of Chu Feng, Bai Liluo and even Wuming Doutian had all changed.<br>They were all able to sense Lanfu Longping&rsquo;s aura.<br>He was emitting the aura of a rank seven Utmost Exalted.<br>He was not lying. If he really intended to unleash a massacre upon the Chu Heavenly Clan like that Lanfu Jianpeng, he could wipe them out at that exact moment.<br>Even though Bai Liluo was present, she would still not be a match for him.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, do you believe me now?&rdquo; Lanfu Longping asked Bai Liluo.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;<br>Bai Liluo remained somewhat unconvinced. She coyly let out a cold snort before saying, &ldquo;I still refuse to believe you. Thus, you&rsquo;d best keep your promise, for I, Bai Liluo, am not a pushover.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young lady can rest assured, I, Lanfu Longping, guarantee that no one will dare touch the Chu Heavenly Clan again,&rdquo; swore Lanfu Longping.<br>As he spoke, he actually bowed respectfully again.<br>Faced with such a respectful and courteous attitude, even the prideful Bai Liluo found herself unable to continue expressing her distrust.<br>Lanfu Longping was stronger than them. Yet, he was so courteous, and showed such etiquette.<br>Truth be told, he had provided a very ample amount of sincerity<br>&ldquo;Senior, I accept your condition,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng had no choice but to accept the condition. He simply had no leeway to refuse.<br>Besides, he could not find any fault with Lanfu Longping&rsquo;s condition.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, our Blue Talisman Clan cannot be exposed. As such, I&rsquo;ll have to ask you to keep these matters and what happened here, as well as our clan&rsquo;s relationship with the Wuming Clan, confidential.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will keep it confidential,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, young friend Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s nothing else, we&rsquo;ll be taking our leave now.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Lanfu Longping grabbed Lanfu Jianpeng and prepared to leave.<br>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng called out to him.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s call immediately caused Lanfu Longping&rsquo;s heart to leap.<br>In terms of cultivation, there was no reason for him to fear Chu Feng. However, he was definitely afraid of Chu Xuanyuan. Thus, he indirectly felt fear towards Chu Feng.<br>He was truly afraid that Chu Feng would try to make things difficult for them.<br>However, he still managed to ask calmly, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, is there anything else you need?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, I have something that I wish to say to Wuming Doutian.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng turned to Wuming Doutian. &ldquo;Wuming Doutian, I hope that you&rsquo;ll be able to keep your promise and stop causing harm to the residents of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Else&hellip; even if your sons are to plead for you again, I Chu Feng, will not spare you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Ancestral Martial Starfield is now your Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory. I Wuming Doutian, will only stay in the Starfield Master Realm obediently.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore Chu Feng, some rumors are not trustworthy. I am actually not as wicked beyond redemption as the rumors make me seem. If the chance presents itself, we should have a proper chat. Perhaps your misunderstandings about me will be clarified then,&rdquo; said Wuming Doutian.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, please rest assured. If he dares to act willfully again, even if you decide to spare him, this old man will not spare him,&rdquo; Lanfu Longping added.<br>Then, the three of them left.<br>&hellip;...<br>After they left, a pensive look appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; asked Bai Liluo.<br>&ldquo;Big sister Liluo, don&rsquo;t you think that Lanfu Longping&rsquo;s attitude is simply excessively good?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It seemed like he was somewhat afraid of us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Especially when I called for them to stop when they were leaving earlier, I noticed that his body trembled the instant I called out to him.&rdquo;<br>"His reaction didn't make any sense at all&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to worry about? Perhaps he&rsquo;s afraid of me, your big sister.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, even though I&rsquo;m no match for him right now, I will surpass him sooner or later,&rdquo; said Bai Liluo proudly.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled. &ldquo;Mn, I think that must be the case. He must be afraid of my big sister Liluo.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Big sister Liluo, it is all thanks to you today. Otherwise, I truly wouldn&rsquo;t dare imagine what would&rsquo;ve happened to our Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a serious expression.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. With our relationship, there&rsquo;s no need to be this courteous with me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;re here, I will protect the entire Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Bai Liluo guaranteed as she patted her chest.<br>&ldquo;Wuu~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the smile on her face disappeared, and was replaced with a look of pain.<br>Then, Bai Liluo was suddenly unable to stand firm.<br>Seeing this, Chu Feng immediately rushed forth to support her.<br>The moment he caught her, Chu Feng discovered that her body was ice-cold, and her internal aura was extremely chaotic. Whilst her outer body was ice-cold, her insides were scalding hot like magma, and surging and wreaking havoc.<br>&ldquo;Big sister Liluo, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng started to panic. He could tell that Bai Liluo&rsquo;s condition was very dangerous.<br>She might even die.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, I&rsquo;m alright. This is merely caused by forcibly leaving closed-door training,&rdquo; Bai Liluo said with a smile.<br>Upon treating her condition, Chu Feng discovered that she was not lying.<br>Her condition had indeed been caused by her forcibly leaving closed-door training.<br>Fortunately, Chu Feng was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist now, and his bloodline had awakened, causing his world spirit techniques to be extremely powerful.<br>After being treated by Chu Feng, Bai Liluo&rsquo;s condition finally began her better.<br></p></div>
