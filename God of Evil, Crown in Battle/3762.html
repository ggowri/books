        <h1>Chapter 3761</h1>
        <div> - Scram!!!<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With fear all over his face, Tuoba Chengan looked at Long Daozhi.<br>The fear on his face was not only visible to Long Daozhi. Even the bystanders were capable of noticing it.<br>This made the crowd realize that Long Daozhi seemed to be far stronger than they had imagined him to be.<br>After all, they&rsquo;d heard about what sort of person Tuoba Chengan was.<br>If even someone like Tuoba Chengan was afraid, it would mean that Long Daozhi was likely capable of causing restraining fear to even the All-heaven Sect.<br>Thinking of that, the crowd&rsquo;s fear towards the All-heaven Sect decreased a lot.<br>That said, at the time when the great majority of the crowd were starting to ease their hearts, there were also many people that became even more afraid, even more on edge.<br>They were the people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan led by Linghu Zhishi.<br>Long Daozhi had come out precisely to uphold justice.<br>They had been the ones colluding with the All-heaven Sect. Now that Tuoba Chengan had been taken care of, it was their turn to suffer.<br>The more powerful Long Daozhi was, the worse it was for them.<br>&ldquo;Why are you still standing there? Scram,&rdquo; Long Daozhi looked at Tuoba Chengan and spoke coldly.<br>Hearing those words, Tuoba Chengan actually didn&rsquo;t say anything, and immediately dragged his weak body away and rapidly fled.<br>Although Long Daozhi had crippled Tuoba Chengan&rsquo;s cultivation, he did not cripple it completely.<br>In the end, Long Daozhi had acted leniently.<br>To be exact, Tuoba Chengan&rsquo;s cultivation was currently decreasing. If he was treated quickly, his cultivation could still be saved.<br>That said, it remained that Tuoba Chengan was seriously injured. Thus, he would likely not be able to save that rank three Utmost Exalted cultivation of his.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Linghu Zhishi, how does it feel to be a puppet?&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, after Tuoba Chengan left, Long Daozhi turned his gaze to Linghu Zhishi.<br>&ldquo;City Master Long, I truly didn&rsquo;t become their puppet. They were the ones that came to make a connection with me of their own accord. They told me they would help me take care of the Wuming Clan. Never did they say that they would meddle in the affairs of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;City Master Long, you should know about the resources of our Ancestral Martial Starfield too. Our resources are far inferior to their All-heaven Starfield's. There is nothing in our Ancestral Martial Starfield that they would want.&rdquo;<br>Linghu Zhishi tried his hardest to explain. He was trying to remove the accusation that he was being used as a puppet.<br>&ldquo;Do you take me for a fool, or are you taking everyone present here to be fools?&rdquo; Long Daozhi narrowed his brows and asked coldly.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Linghu Zhishi wanted to say something.<br>However, before he could say anything, he was shouted down angrily by Long Daozhi, &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;<br>No matter how unwilling Linghu Zhishi might be, he could only grit his teeth and not dare to say anything. Like a student being punished by his teacher, he lowered his head in silence, afraid to argue.<br>At that moment, the people present had a whole new level of respect for Long Daozhi. Naturally, this included Linghu Zhishi.<br>Linghu Zhishi truly never would&rsquo;ve imagined that Long Daozhi was actually that powerful.<br>He was so powerful that even the rank three Utmost Exalted Tuoba Chengan was completely powerless before him.<br>Linghu Zhishi felt that Long Daozhi was at least a rank three Utmost Exalted. It might even be possible for him to be a rank four Utmost Exalted.<br>Not even the All-heaven Sect would dare to rashly provoke an existence like Long Daozhi. As for him, it was simply impossible.<br>Suddenly, Long Daozhi waved his hand at Linghu Zhishi. &ldquo;Scram.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Take your clansmen with you and scram.&rdquo;<br>When Long Daozhi said those words, his tone was filled with disappointment.<br>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let them get away just like this.&rdquo;<br>Right after Long Daozhi said those words, Gu Mingyuan spoke out against it.<br>She still had a furious look on her face. Her eyes were like two sharp blades as she stared at Linghu Zhishi, who stood beside Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Gu Mingyuan, Chu Feng, please give me face today and drop this subject for the time being.&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi looked at Gu Mingyuan, and also took a glance at Chu Feng when he said those words.<br>&ldquo;How could we spare them? They nearly massacred the entire Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could we let traitors like them get away just like this?&rdquo;<br>Gu Mingyuan was still unwilling to drop the matter.<br>&ldquo;Senior, it&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; Chu Feng arrived beside Gu Mingyuan.<br>Chu Feng understood that if it wasn&rsquo;t for Long Daozhi&rsquo;s arrival, they would most likely all be dead.<br>After all, at the final moment, Linghu Zhishi was no longer someone they were afraid of. Instead, it was that All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s Supreme Elder Tuoba Chengan who became their most dangerous foe.<br>Facing a rank three Utmost Exalted-level expert, even if he possessed the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd, Chu Feng still did not hold absolute certainty in being able to win against him.<br>It could be said that without a doubt, Long Daozhi had saved their lives. Thus, Chu Feng would naturally have to agree to his request.<br>After all, in the end, the ones that had suffered the most were the Linghu Heavenly Clan. At least, he had managed to avenge Chu Lingxi.<br>After Chu Feng spoke out, Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s expression changed repeatedly. In the end, she said no more.<br>The crowd were truly surprised that Gu Mingyuan, with how hot-tempered and fearless she was, with how she dared to go against Long Daozhi even after everyone witnessed how powerful he was, would actually be persuaded by a single sentence from Chu Feng when Long Daozhi&rsquo;s persuasion had failed.<br>The crowd were truly unable to understand it. They were unable to understand why a person of the younger generation like Chu Feng would hold such weight to someone like Gu Mingyuan.<br>In fact, even Chu Lingxi was surprised by her mother&rsquo;s reaction.<br>Although he had decided to give Long Daozhi face. Chu Feng still held misgivings in his heart. After all, Linghu Zhishi was still a very dangerous person.<br>Thus, Chu Feng did not directly agree for the matter to be dropped. Instead, he said to Long Daozhi, &ldquo;Senior, while I can spare them today, if they are to cause trouble for me again, I will definitely not spare them easily.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you can rest assured. Not only will the Linghu Heavenly Clan not cause trouble for you again, if they dare to cause trouble for anyone in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, I will not forgive them," Long Daozhi guaranteed Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words, Linghu Zhishi&rsquo;s expression turned very ugly.<br>It was one thing for them to not attack Chu Feng, Gu Mingyuan and the others. However, Long Daozhi actually stated that he would not allow them to attack anyone in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>With that, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that their Linghu Heavenly Clan could not offend anyone in the Ancestral Martial Starfield?<br>If that were the case, what sort of status would their Linghu Heavenly Clan still have in the Ancestral Martial Starfield?<br>&ldquo;Did you not hear what I just said?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why are you still standing here? Take your clansmen and scram!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Long Daozhi spoke to Linghu Zhishi again.<br>His words were extremely merciless. Already displeased, Linghu Zhishi felt even more displeased upon hearing those words.<br>However, he still did not dare to show his displeasure. With an eagerly attentive expression, he clasped his fist and bowed to Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for being lenient, City Master Long.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Linghu Zhishi turned around and withdrew with his Linghu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>Seeing the withdrawing Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, many people gasped with awe.<br>After all, the Linghu Heavenly Clan had just become the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>However, they simply had none of the demeanor of an overlord now. They simply resembled a bunch of stray dogs. All of their dignity, honor and status had been forfeited.<br>Before that, no one had anticipated that the awe-inspiring Linghu Heavenly Clan would be reduced to such a state.<br>To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, Long Daozhi suddenly spoke again.<br>Long Daozhi&rsquo;s words not only astonished the people of the Linghu Heavenly Clan, but they also astonished Chu Feng and others.<br>&ldquo;When I said scram, I was telling you to scram out of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
