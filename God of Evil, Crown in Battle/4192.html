        <div> - Unexpected Pleasant Surprise<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. WIth your strength, it should be impossible for you all to break this ferocious beast&rsquo;s teeth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Strange. Why would its teeth be broken then?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This sort of ferocious beast treasures their teeth a lot.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah, forget it, forget it. Who cares how its teeth broke, let&rsquo;s cut it up first.&rdquo;<br>As the man spoke, he raised his butcher&rsquo;s knife. With a &lsquo;puchi,&rsquo; the knife hacked the ferocious beast in two.<br>Right after the knife struck, a figure immediately leapt out from within the ferocious beast&rsquo;s carcass.<br>It was naturally none other than Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Holy hell! Why the heck is there a person inside this ferocious beast&rsquo;s stomach?&rdquo;<br>When they saw Chu Feng, the group of people that were completely unprepared were all shocked by Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng did not bother to pay attention to them. He first found some water and washed himself. Only afterward did he smile at them. &ldquo;Everyone, thanks a lot. May I know where this is?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; who are you? You don&rsquo;t know what sort of place this is?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why would you be inside that ferocious beast&rsquo;s stomach?&rdquo;<br>Those people had managed to calm down. They then began to pepper Chu Feng with questions.<br>&ldquo;I came here through a spirit formation gate. After coming here, my cultivation suddenly disappeared. Because of that, I ended up being devoured by that ferocious beast,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Spirit formation gate?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Cultivation disappeared?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens! You couldn&rsquo;t possibly be someone from outside, right?&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, the people that had managed to calm down were once again startled.<br>&ldquo;Correct, I came here through a spirit formation gate,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;A newcomer. So it&rsquo;s actually a newcomer.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Quickly, report to Lord Golden Crane. A newcomer has come.&rdquo;<br>Once they confirmed that Chu Feng come through a spirit formation gate, those people became very excited.<br>Many amongst them were shouting loudly as they rushed out.<br>Not long afterward, even more people rushed into the kitchen.<br>The windows and door were completely packed full with people.<br>It was like those people were watching a show monkey as they stared at Chu Feng with curiosity-filled eyes.<br>Some amongst them even brought food.<br>They were eating watermelons or snacking on melon seeds. They really did look like people who were there for a show.<br>They were discussing amongst themselves as they examined Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually a youngster. It&rsquo;s been a long time since a youngster came.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;True. Do you think this youngster might be an expert cultivator?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to guess. Judging from the way he looks, he can&rsquo;t be very old, and is most likely a person of the younger generation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How powerful can a person of the younger generation be?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, he must&rsquo;ve accidentally triggered the spirit formation gate and was then sucked in here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Accidentally triggered the spirit formation gate? Damn, he&rsquo;s truly unlucky then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With how young he is, he should have a great future ahead of him. Yet now, he&rsquo;s going to be trapped here for the rest of his life. This is truly a pity.&rdquo;<br>The crowd continued to discuss amongst themselves as they looked at Chu Feng.<br>Some were curious, some were excited, and some were felt sorry for him.<br>Their conversations gave Chu Feng some information about his circumstances.<br>It seemed like once one entered that place, it would be difficult to leave...<br>&ldquo;Step aside, step aside! Lord Golden Crane is here!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, voices sounded from outside.<br>Hearing those voices, the completely packed crowd forced themselves to either side and formed a pathway.<br>Following the pathway, a figure walked into the kitchen.<br>Chu Feng was pleasantly surprised to see that person. In fact, he didn&rsquo;t even dare believe his eyes.<br>The person that appeared was an old man.<br>He wore a golden gown. He had a head of long golden hair and a golden beard. His eyebrows were also golden. In fact, even his skin was golden. Those golden eyes of his appeared extremely spirited.<br>When the old man saw Chu Feng, he was also in disbelief.<br>He even rubbed his eyes a couple times before finally believing that the person standing before him was who he thought it was.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Chu Feng?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really you?!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had a smile on his face as he stepped forward. &ldquo;Senior Golden Crane, it&rsquo;s been a long time.&rdquo;<br>The reason for that was because the completely golden old man was the Golden Crane True Immortal.<br>The Golden Crane True Immortal was a senior that Chu Feng had encountered in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>They had a rather deep relationship. The last time Chu Feng had encountered Xue Ji and the Old Cat was when he was helping the Golden Crane True Immortal retrieve the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip.<br>Even though he had managed to successfully retrieve the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip, it had been snatched away by the Old Cat that had appeared out of nowhere.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng had felt like he'd failed the Golden Crane True Immortal the entire time.<br>The last time Chu Feng had met the Golden Crane True Immortal, it had also in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>At that time, there was a blue-gowned individual that'd had a conflict with Chu Feng&rsquo;s father.<br>Although everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm had had no idea that Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, that Chu Feng was a Chu Heavenly Clansman, the blue-gowned individual had tried to kill Chu Feng because he'd thought Chu Feng to possibly be Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son.<br>At that time, Chu Feng had been too weak. He was simply no match for the blue-gowned individual.<br>It was the Golden Crane True Immortal&rsquo;s appearance that had scared away the blue-gowned individual.<br>At that time, the Golden Crane True Immortal had bid his farewell to Chu Feng. He had told Chu Feng that he&rsquo;d be leaving the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. As for where he was going, he had been undecided.<br>That had been the final meeting between Chu Feng and the Golden Crane True Immortal.<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng had entered the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm and had traveled throughout the Ancestral Martial Starfield. His cultivation had also increased by leaps and bounds.<br>However, he had never encountered the Golden Crane True Immortal again.<br>Chu Feng had thought that he might not be able to meet the Golden Crane True Immortal again.<br>Never had he expected to encounter him there.<br>This was truly a sudden and pleasant surprise.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&hellip; how come you&rsquo;ve also entered this place?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah, you brat, you&rsquo;re simply too careless.&rdquo;<br>After the joy from seeing Chu Feng disappeared, the Golden Crane True Immortal shook his head and sighed.<br>&ldquo;Wait. Lord Golden Crane, you called him Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could he be that cultivation genius you mentioned, that Chu Feng?&rdquo; Someone asked from the crowd.<br>Then, the gazes that the crowd looked to Chu Feng with changed.<br>Their eyes were actually burning with emotions.<br>&ldquo;Right, he&rsquo;s that genius that I encountered in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, Chu Feng,&rdquo; said the Golden Crane True Immortal.<br>Once he said those words, the crowd grew even more excited. Some even started cheering.<br>Countless voice transmissions began to enter Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>Those were all voices filled with respect and admiration...<br>Even though it was the first time that they'd met Chu Feng, it appeared that he was already renowned.<br>Afterwards, the Golden Crane True Immortal arranged a palace for Chu Feng to rest in.<br>Chu Feng also gained a rough idea as to what sort of place he was in from the Golden Crane True Immortal&rsquo;s explanations.<br>Firstly, all the people that arrived there had either accidentally or intentionally encountered the black spirit formation gate.<br>They had then been sucked into that place.<br>However, one thing worthy of mentioning was that they had all encountered the spirit formation gate at completely different places.<br>That was normal. After all, Chu Feng had guessed that Zhuge Yuankong had created multiple entrances to his treasury, and had established them all over the world.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng had deduced that that place must be the treasury that Zhuge Yuankong had left behind.<br>The only thing was that the majority of the crowd had no idea that such was the case.<br>They all thought that it was an ordinary remnant, and that they had simply been unlucky to be sucked in to that world.<br></p></div>
