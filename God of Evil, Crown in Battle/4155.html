        <h1>Chapter 4154</h1>
        <div> - Strange Tornado<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the leader of his clan, the middle-aged man had a cultivation of rank five Utmost Exalted.<br>In his impression, Long Daozhi was only at most a rank four Utmost Exalted.<br>That was the reason why he had looked down on Long Daozhi the entire time.<br>Yet, Long Daozhi had actually blocked his oppressive might. This meant that Long Daozhi&rsquo;s cultivation was the same as his own, that Long Daozhi was also a rank five Utmost Exalted.<br>&ldquo;No wonder your killing intent earlier was so sharp.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Turns out your cultivation is no longer beneath my own.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you&rsquo;d best not think that you&rsquo;ll be able to take us on just because you&rsquo;re a rank five Utmost Exalted now.&rdquo;<br>Although he was surprised the middle-aged man wasn&rsquo;t scared. Instead, he looked to the other three leaders.<br>&ldquo;Why are you three still standing there? Didn&rsquo;t we agree that we&rsquo;d have a complete falling-out with that bastard?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why did you all decide to haggle over price with him now? Could it be that you plan to continue to be stepped on by this trash from the Ancestral Martial Starfield?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you all planning to continue to listen and obey this trash in this Endless Abyss?!&rdquo; the middle-aged man asked loudly.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Then, three rank five Utmost Exalted-level auras were released.<br>They were the other three leaders.<br>The three people that had been pleading for Long Daozhi to sell the extra Dragon Vein Blood Stone to them now all had sinister and vicious looks on their faces.<br>&ldquo;Long Daozhi, taking into consideration that you&rsquo;re the one who invited Chu Feng, we had planned to stand on equal footing with you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, never would we have expected that you&rsquo;re actually someone who would refuse the face that is given to you. By relying on the genius world spiritist Chu Feng you dared act excessively. Even daring to crap all over our heads.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve truly forgotten your status.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do not blame us for being heartless, this is something that you&rsquo;ve asked for,&rdquo; the old lady said fiercely.<br>The two remaining leaders also unleashed their killing intent.<br>The intentions of the four leaders were extremely obvious.<br>They planned to eliminate Long Daozhi and then forcibly take control of Chu Feng.<br>With that, they would be able to do as they pleased inside the Endless Abyss.<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha!&rdquo;<br>However, not only did Long Daozhi show no sign of fear, he instead raised his head and laughed loudly.<br>His laughter was not only ear-piercing, it was also very crazed. It seemed like he had managed to see through everything.<br>His laughter baffled those four leaders.<br>They did not understand why Long Daozhi would react in such a manner.<br>When Long Daozhi stopped laughing, a malevolent look appeared on his face.<br>&ldquo;Since you four are the ones to have a falling-out with me first, do not blame me, Long Daozhi for being heartless.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, a violent wind swept forth.<br>The wind was so powerful that even the four leaders found it difficult to withstand it.<br>Just like that, together with their four world spiritists, they were all blown away by the wind.<br>When they landed, they were all bleeding from their seven facial orifices and seriously injured.<br>That said, the four leaders were not concerned too much with their injuries. Instead, they were all terrified by Long Daozhi&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; you&rsquo;re actually a rank six Utmost Exalted?!&rdquo;<br>It was only at that moment they realized that Long Daozhi&rsquo;s cultivation had already reached rank six Utmost Exalted, and had surpassed their own.<br>&ldquo;Do you all now know who the actual trash is?&rdquo;<br>As Long Daozhi spoke, his ice-cold killing intent emerged from thin air and covered the four leaders as well as their four world spiritists.<br>&ldquo;City Master Long, please spare us, please spare us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We were bewildered by greed. Please take into consideration that we&rsquo;re from the same clan and spare our lives.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the situation had turned bad, the four leaders and the four world spiritists all began to beg for forgiveness.<br>&ldquo;To bully the weak and fear the strong, you all are truly a disgrace to our Dragon Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Scram!&rdquo; said Long Daozhi coldly.<br>Seeing that, the eight people simply did not dare to stay any longer. Even though they had been seriously injured, they immediately got up and fled.<br>&ldquo;Senior, in the end, you&rsquo;re still softhearted,&rdquo; Chu Feng stepped forward and said to Long Daozhi after witnessing how he had spared those people.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all people that have been abandoned by the Dragon Clan. They&rsquo;re pitiful souls too,&rdquo; said Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;But they had no intention to spare you earlier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that senior&rsquo;s strength surpasses theirs, you would most definitely have been killed by them today,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This is the only chance that I&rsquo;ll give them. There will not be another,&rdquo; said Long Daozhi.<br>Hearing that, Chu Feng was unable to say anything else. After all, this could be considered to be Long Daozhi&rsquo;s domestic affairs.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you should refine these right now,&rdquo; Chu Feng handed the Dragon Vein Blood Stones to Long Daozhi.<br>Long Daozhi did not hesitate, and immediately began to refine the Dragon Vein Blood Stones.<br>After refining all twenty-one Dragon Vein Blood Stones, Long Daozhi not only managed to restore his exhausted bloodline power, but his bloodline power became even more abundant than before.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I truly can&rsquo;t thank you enough.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Long Daozhi, owe you an enormous favor.&rdquo;<br>After standing up, a look of gratitude filled Long Daozhi&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you&rsquo;re the benefactor to my Chu Heavenly Clan. It is my honor to be able to help you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng with a smile.<br>Seeing that Long Daozhi&rsquo;s bloodline power had recovered, Chu Feng felt joy from the bottom of his heart.<br>&ldquo;Roooar~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Huu, huu, huu~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, right after Chu Feng finished saying those words, his expression changed enormously.<br>It was not only Chu Feng. Long Daozhi reacted in the same manner.<br>It turned out that a massive tornado had appeared to their southeast.<br>That tornado rolled up all the surrounding sand and dust, and was rapidly moving towards where Chu Feng and Long Daozhi were.<br>The instant he discovered the massive tornado, Long Daozhi grabbed Chu Feng and began fleeing in the opposite direction.<br>The massive tornado was simply too terrifying. If they were drawn into it, they would most definitely die.<br>But the tornado was simply too fast. Even though Long Daozhi was giving his all, he was soon caught by the tornado.<br>After the massive tornado engulfed Chu Feng and Long Daozhi, all their protective abilities were instantly destroyed.<br>Then, Chu Feng felt his head spinning and his body seemingly being sliced away by countless blades. He soon lost consciousness.<br>When Chu Feng woke up, he discovered that he was actually fine. Although his clothes were tattered and his body was covered in wounds, they were merely bruises and minor injuries.<br>However, Long Daozhi was nowhere to be seen.<br>Chu Feng got up and shouted for Long Daozhi. He also attempted to look for him. Yet, he was unable to find him.<br>In fact, even Long Daozhi&rsquo;s aura had disappeared completely.<br>&ldquo;That tornado was truly strange,&rdquo; Chu Feng narrowed his brows. He felt that things were simply too outrageous.<br>Although the massive tornado was extremely powerful, it was not fatal. Since he was alive, he naturally wouldn't be worried for Long Daozhi&rsquo;s safety.<br>Chu Feng felt that they were merely separated by that tornado.<br>But, for such a terrifying tornado to appear in a place like the Endless Abyss, it should be fatal.<br>Yet, that tornado had not been fatal. It had only separated them. This confused Chu Feng.<br>That said, he couldn&rsquo;t just sit around after failing to find Long Daozhi. Because of that, he decided to continue with his mission.<br>With that, he immediately set out again.<br>Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s perception was limited in the massive Endless Abyss, it remained that he was a world spiritist. Thus, he could follow signs to find the rough locations where treasures should be, and then track them down.<br>That was how Chu Feng had found the Dragon Vein Blood Stones earlier.<br>Finding the Dragon Vein Blood Stones was actually only a coincidence. Chu Feng had been proceeding onward the entire time with the Dragon Vein Source Stones in mind.<br>That said, there were already people that had entered the Endless Abyss before Chu Feng and Long Daozhi.<br>Since they were able to breach the spirit formation around the entrance, it meant that those world spiritists were pretty powerful.<br>Likely, there were also people among them that had detected the location of the Dragon Vein Source Stones.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng had no time to delay. Since he was unable to find Long Daozhi, he could only proceed onward on his own.<br>&ldquo;This aura?&rdquo;<br>On his journey onward, Chu Feng suddenly stopped. A surprised look appeared in his eyes.<br></p></div>
