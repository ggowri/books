        <div>: Failure?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;<br>After saying these two words, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief left the area. Long Duan left together with him too, leaving Long Mumu and her mother by themselves in the palace.<br>Long Mumu was absolutely certain that she had had her enemies cornered a moment ago, but after receiving a nonchalant response from her father, she started to panic.<br>&ldquo;Lord Mother, why does it seem like father isn&rsquo;t too concerned with this matter?&rdquo; Long Mumu voiced her worries.<br>She was afraid that the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief still wouldn&rsquo;t deal with Chu Feng and his master after all that had been said.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry. Your father has already made up his mind on what to do.&rdquo;<br>In comparison, Long Mumu&rsquo;s mother looked more confident.<br>A short moment later, Long Mumu&rsquo;s mother brought Long Mumu back to the Dragon Vein Source once more.<br>Given her understanding of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, she knew that the latter wouldn&rsquo;t follow through on his promise so easily in the first place, especially given that the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Ground was at stake.<br>And now that she had worsened the impression the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had of Chu Feng and his master, all that was left to be done was to light a spark, and Chu Feng and his master would be goners.<br>&hellip;<br>Time ticked by.<br>It had already been seven days since Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao had entered the Dragon Vein Source.<br>In these seven days, other than the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief running off to meet Long Mumu and her mother once, he had barely left the side of the Dragon Vein Source at all.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t the only one that had chosen to remain here.<br>During this period of time, Long Duan and the other Supreme Elders, as well as Long Mumu and her mother, had never left the area at all.<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the other Supreme Elders were all waiting for the good news regarding the opening of the Dragon Vein Source, whereas Long Mumu and her mother were waiting for the deaths of Chu Feng, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Long Xiaoxiao, and her mother.<br>However, ever since Chu Feng and Long Xiaoxiao had entered the Dragon Vein Source, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had been sitting on the spot with his eyes tightly shut. Even though the formation remained activated, it really looked as if he had fallen asleep.<br>Even when those from the Dragon Clan stepped forward to talk to him, he didn&rsquo;t give any response at all.<br>Out of fear of affecting the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, none of them dared to forcefully shake him to get a response out of him, so they had no choice but to wait on the spot.<br>Those people from the Dragon Clan had no idea what the current condition of the Dragon Vein Source was, and their patience was swiftly running thin.<br>To make things worse, they noticed that the peak of the Dragon Vein Source had lost the mystical glow it had always emanated.<br>In fact, cracks had started appearing at the peak, and it looked as if it would collapse at any moment.<br>Rather than to say that the Dragon Vein Source was being opened, it looked more as if it was going to vanish from the face of the world.<br>This left the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others panicked. They fidgeted restlessly on the spot, and some of them even had cold sweat dripping from them.<br>On the other hand, while Long Mumu and her mother looked as if they were dying from anxiousness on the surface, in truth, they were more than delighted to see such a turn of events.<br>Compared to the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the Supreme Elders, the two of them weren&rsquo;t as bothered about the future of the Dragon Clan.<br>What they prioritized were only their own interests.<br>And right now, the one thing that they hoped the most was for Chu Feng and his master, and Long Xiaoxiao and her mother to die.<br>If the opening of the Dragon Vein Source were to fail, there was not a sliver of a chance that Chu Feng and his master would be walking out of the Dragon Clan at all.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, we can&rsquo;t wait anymore!&rdquo;<br>Long Duan and the other Supreme Elders turned to look at the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief nervously.<br>Their intention was to have the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief question the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and get the latter to clarify what was going on.<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief looked a little troubled before their expectant eyes.<br>More than anyone else, he wanted to know what the current situation was, but he was afraid that he would mess everything up if he were to interrupt the Ox-nosed Old Daoist at this juncture.<br>However, the circumstances were different now. After a short internal struggle, he prepared himself to wake up the Ox-nosed Old Daoist and question him on this matter.<br>Shoosh!<br>But it was at this moment that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist opened his eyes and rose to his feet.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, how did the Dragon Vein Source end up like this? What&rsquo;s happening inside? Could it be that the opening of the Dragon Vein Source failed?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had woken up, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the other Supreme Elders of the Dragon Clan immediately rushed forward and surrounded him.<br>In contrast to the crowd from the Dragon Clan, who looked as if they were going to asphyxiate from nervousness, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist laughed heartily and replied, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s already done!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Done? Grandmaster, do you mean to say that&hellip; you have successfully opened the Dragon Vein Source?&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked anxiously.<br>&ldquo;Yes. With this old man making a move, there&rsquo;s no way anything could have gone wrong!&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist replied confidently.<br>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing those words, the crowd from the Dragon Clan took another look at the Dragon Vein Source. However, they were still feeling very unconfident about this.<br>No matter how they looked at it, it didn&rsquo;t seem like the Dragon Vein Source had been opened. On the contrary, it looked as if it had been ruined instead.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, if you have successfully opened the Dragon Vein Source, why does it look as if nothing has changed then? Instead, it appears to me that the mystical nature of the Dragon Vein Source has disappeared&hellip; as if it has been ruined?<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, shouldn&rsquo;t you give me a logical explanation for this?&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief voiced his doubts.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, this old man wouldn&rsquo;t lie to you. You&rsquo;re in for a great surprise very soon!&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist patted the shoulders of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief with a bright smile on his lips.<br>Even though the doubts of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief hadn&rsquo;t been dispelled yet, seeing how confident the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was, he couldn&rsquo;t find anything else to say either.<br>After all, from the start to the end, none of them had been able to see through the Dragon Vein Source.<br>So, the only option they had was to wait for the so-called surprise the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke of.<br>But of course, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had also come to a decision as to what he would do if the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had lied to him&hellip;<br>&hellip;<br>Meanwhile, there were changes occurring in the Dragon Vein Source too.<br>The ocean was still there. Even though its water level had dropped a little, the changes weren&rsquo;t really visible to the eye.<br>It was just that this ocean was no longer golden in color. It had turned into clear water instead.<br>This clear ocean didn&rsquo;t have the powerful aura that the golden ocean had. All of the energy that it used to have had already gone into Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s body.<br>On the other hand, Long Xiaoxiao appeared to be in a very feeble state. Her face was pale, and she didn&rsquo;t even have the strength to rise to her feet. Even when she tried to lift her hands, her arms would tremble uncontrollably. It was almost as if she was fatally ill.<br>Seeing that everything had come to a rest, Chu Feng stepped forward and asked, &ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, how are you feeling at the moment?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little benefactor, a powerful surge of energy gushed into my body earlier, and I&rsquo;m having difficulties trying to assimilate it. I feel like my body is going to blow up at any moment. I feel very uncomfortable inside,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao replied.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, you have to hold on. As long as you can harness this power, there will be no one in the Dragon Clan who will be able to make things difficult for you and your mother anymore,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;W-why?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because the power of the Dragon Vein Source has already entered your body. You are the Dragon Vein Source now,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;I am&hellip; the Dragon Vein Source?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s pale face warped in astonishment. Her eyes were filled with disbelief and shock.<br>Clearly, she hadn&rsquo;t expected such a turn of events.<br></p></div>
