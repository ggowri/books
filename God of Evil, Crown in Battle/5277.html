        <h1>Chapter 5278</h1>
        <div>: Even Top Experts Are Only Allowed to Spectate<br>A box was floating above each of the five towers.<br>Four of the towers and their respective boxes were golden, but the remaining one and its box were red.<br>&ldquo;Each of you may choose a tower to challenge. Ascend to the top and acquire the box, and you&rsquo;ll be guaranteed to survive the upcoming ordeal,&rdquo; the glowing woman said.<br>&ldquo;What if we fail to obtain the box?&rdquo; Liu Kuo asked.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking the obvious. Those who fail will naturally die.&rdquo;<br>Even though the glowing woman&rsquo;s face was imperceptible, Chu Feng could still sense her directing a sharp glare in Liu Kuo&rsquo;s direction.<br>&ldquo;Grasp this opportunity well. Be reminded that there&rsquo;s a time limit. You&rsquo;ll be deemed to have failed the trial if you aren&rsquo;t able to reach the top of the tower by the time limit,&rdquo; the glowing woman said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, why are there five towers here? Is there someone else here?&rdquo; Liu Kuo asked.<br>&ldquo;The four of you are the only ones here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Then&hellip; what&rsquo;s with that red tower?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Obtaining the golden box will save you, but obtaining the red box will save all four of you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I see. Thank you for your reminder.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Elder, when does the trial start?&rdquo; the white-haired woman rose to her feet and asked.<br>&ldquo;Woah, I didn&rsquo;t know you could talk. Where&rsquo;s Long Chengyu? Did you really defeat him?&rdquo; Liu Kuo exclaimed.<br>The white-haired woman ignored him.<br>&ldquo;The trial has already begun.&rdquo;<br>The glowing woman pointed to the forest, where an incense stick had appeared out of nowhere. Despite the massive size of the incense stick, it didn&rsquo;t slow down the rate it was burning down in the least.<br>Needless to say, this was the time limit they had for challenging the towers.<br>Shoosh!<br>The white-haired woman immediately rushed for one of the golden towers.<br>&ldquo;How selfish.&rdquo; Liu Kuo clicked his tongue. He turned to the duo beside him and said, &ldquo;Brother Chu Feng and little sister Long, there&rsquo;s no need for you to head over. Just sit tight and watch the show. I&rsquo;ll save the three of you.&rdquo;<br>Liu Kuo dashed toward the red tower.<br>Grar!<br>A dragon roar manifested in a visible red sonic boom as soon as he came close to the red tower, protecting the tower from any intruders.<br>Liu Kuo was still thinking of forcing his way through the red sonic boom, but all of his apertures began to bleed. He was left with no choice but to back down from the challenge.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, little sister Long, it&rsquo;s not I don&rsquo;t want to help you but there&rsquo;s something really weird about the red tower. I&rsquo;m afraid that you&rsquo;ll have to count on yourself,&rdquo; Liu Kuo said as he wiped off his nosebleed.<br>Long Xiaoxiao turned to the red tower.<br>The earlier red sonic boom was indeed terrifying, but its prowess corresponded to one&rsquo;s cultivation level. This meant that she could challenge it despite her weaker cultivation&hellip; and she was tempted to do so.<br>She didn&rsquo;t want anything bad to happen to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go, Xiaoxiao,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go? Brother Chu Feng, didn&rsquo;t you see what happened to me earlier?&rdquo; Liu Kuo exclaimed in disbelief.<br>&ldquo;Brother Liu Kuo, I am not confident of it either. You should enter the golden tower lest I fail.&rdquo; Chu Feng patted Liu Kuo&rsquo;s shoulder before making his way toward the red tower.<br>Grar!<br>Once again, a furious dragon roar rippled outward in a red sonic boom. Chu Feng impassively pushed his way through the red sonic boom, opened the gate, and entered the tower.<br>&ldquo;How is he fine? Does he feel no pain at all?&rdquo; Liu Kuo&rsquo;s lower jaws slackened in shock.<br>&ldquo;Liu Kuo, you have to work hard too.&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao smiled at Liu Kuo before settling down on the ground.<br>&ldquo;Little sister Long, why are you sitting back down? Aren&rsquo;t you going to enter the tower and fight for your own survival too?&rdquo; Liu Kuo asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for Chu Feng here,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao replied.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wait for him? But he said that he isn&rsquo;t confident of clearing the trial! Are you going to die with him if he fails?&rdquo; Liu Kuo asked.<br>&ldquo;So be it then,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao replied.<br>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; Liu Kuo was rendered speechless. A moment later, he asked, &ldquo;Little sister Long, do you think I look like a dog?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so?&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao was bewildered by the abrupt question.<br>&ldquo;Then why are you making me feel like a single dog? You should feel awful for bullying a monk!&rdquo; Liu Kuo clicked his tongue before heading to one of the golden towers.<br>He didn&rsquo;t want to entrust his life to others.<br>&ldquo;He chose the red tower for your sake, but you&rsquo;d be a fool to leave your life in another&rsquo;s hands,&rdquo; the glowing woman told Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;I know, elder,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao replied.<br>&ldquo;Are you still not going to challenge a golden tower?&rdquo; the glowing woman asked.<br>&ldquo;I trust him,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao replied with a sweet smile.<br>&ldquo;Haa. I guess the fragrance of love does make people dumb,&rdquo; the glowing woman said as she shook her head.<br>By then, Chu Feng had already entered the red tower and found himself surrounded by transparent glass. He was still able to see the fight in the sky and everything in the vicinity, so he was also aware of Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s decision.<br>It was a pity that he couldn&rsquo;t back out of the trial, or else he would have surely given Long Xiaoxiao an earful for her foolishness.<br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not bad. I&rsquo;m becoming fonder of her.&rdquo; Eggy was satisfied with the situation though.<br>&ldquo;How is that not bad? It&rsquo;s plain dumbness,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied angrily.<br>&ldquo;Logically, yes, but she&rsquo;s willing to brave through life and death together with you in this crisis. How many people in the world would be able to make the same decision as she did? That&rsquo;s probably the concept of love has charmed so many people,&rdquo; Eggy said with a sigh.<br>&ldquo;Haa.&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>He didn&rsquo;t have the time to ponder upon whether love was wonderful or not. All he knew was that he had to reach the top of the tower and obtain the red box, or else both he and Long Xiaoxiao would be goners.<br>Standing between him and the stairway to the second floor was a terrifying, skinless figure dripping with blood. It was Chu Feng&rsquo;s first opponent.<br>All in all, Chu Feng would have to defeat eighteen opponents in order to reach the top.<br>Shoosh!<br>Chu Feng suddenly made a move.<br>Whoosh!<br>The blood-red figure responded by spraying its corrosive blood all over the area to block Chu Feng&rsquo;s path.<br>However, Chu Feng dodged the corrosive blood through his nimble movements while searching for opportunities to strike the blood-red figure. An intense fight ensued, though it looked nothing more than child&rsquo;s play compared to the fight in the sky.<br>Boom!<br>Deafening explosions rang ceaselessly in the sky.<br>The crowd couldn&rsquo;t see the demon monk or Long Junlin, just the golden ripples and undulating black aura in the sky. Devastating shockwaves harnessing the power to massacre them rippled from their clashes.<br>If not for the martial power barrier constructed by the Totem Dragon Clansmen, the billions of cultivators beneath would have already died by now.<br>One must know that these cultivators were renowned figures in the Totem Galaxy, with some of them being the overlords in their respective territories. Yet, they could only stand helplessly under the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s protection, unable to do anything at all.<br>This was the gap in their levels!!!<br>As time ticked by, the crowd&rsquo;s confidence began to falter. Long Junlin still hadn&rsquo;t managed to take down the demon monk, whereas the barrier constructed by the four Nine Flags Dragon Warriors was already covered with cracks.<br>The situation was looking grim.<br>The demon monk was not the same person he used to be. He was now a true demon.<br>&ldquo;Use the Dragon Shield!!!&rdquo; the elder with yellow brows roared.<br>He took out a circular shield bearing the insignia of a golden dragon. With a wave of his wrist, he threw the shield into the sky and formed a series of hand seals. Golden light shone from his eyes.<br>Clang!<br>The dragon shield that was only a meter wide swiftly expanded till it was covering the sky. It was transparent despite its massive size, allowing the crowd to continue spectating the terrifying battle of golden and black in the sky.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Saint Dragon Shield! That&rsquo;s an extremely powerful defensive treasure. Is the demon monk really that powerful as to warrant its use?&rdquo;<br>The Saint Dragon Shield was a one-time-use treasure that the Totem Dragon Clan wouldn&rsquo;t use unless they were pushed to a corner. Knowing that, the crowd felt even more unnerved.<br>It only went to show just how powerful the demon monk was.<br>&ldquo;What are you afraid of? It only goes to show that the Totem Dragon Clan loves its people. They are willing to invoke a treasure on the caliber of the Saint Dragon Shield for our sake. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the demon monk is that frightening!&rdquo;<br>Clang!<br>Clang!<br>Clang!<br>Three loud reverberations echoed along with another three bursts of golden light. The other three Nine Flags Dragon Warriors had also thrown out their Saint Dragon Shields too, forming four layers of barriers stacked on top of one another.<br>&ldquo;A four-layered Saint Dragon Shield!&rdquo;<br>Those who thought that the Totem Dragon Clan had invoked the Saint Dragon Shield just to protect them were baffled. Given how valuable the Saint Dragon Shield was, there was no way they would invoke four of them at a single go just to protect them.<br>Grar!<br>The silhouette of a golden dragon could be seen coiling within the four-layered Saint Dragon Shield, ready to guard against any attack. However, Lord Zhen and the others had strained looks on their faces. Channeling the Saint Dragon Shield was taking a toll on them.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng had conquered the fourth layer of the red tower, evident from the green monster&rsquo;s carcass lying at his feet. However, instead of advancing, he looked at the sky with a shocked expression.<br>&ldquo;What a powerful barrier. What are they guarding against?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured.<br>Boom!<br>The earth suddenly shook. Even Chu Feng, despite being deep inside the remnant, was able to feel it. The crowd looked up in the sky, and their faces paled in horror.<br>A massive golden dragon had appeared in the sky. It was so large that the crowd was unable to see it in its full glory in their field of vision. They could only see its humongous body but not its head and tail.<br>In terms of sheer size, the golden dragon spanned over half of the entire Skydomain Lower Realm!<br>At the same time, the black aura converged together to form a massive hand that grabbed the golden dragon. The hand was so huge that the crowd could only see a single finger of it.<br>&ldquo;This is a fight at a completely different level. We won&rsquo;t be able to make a difference at all even if we stepped in!&rdquo; Mo Chengzhou exclaimed in a fluster.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d all be doomed if Long Junlin loses,&rdquo; Ningyu Shangren said.<br></div>
