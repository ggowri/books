        <h1>Chapter 5014</h1>
        <div>: A World of Difference<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Miss Chu, may I ask how powerful are the two elders from your Heavenwind Sword Sect?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The black-haired elder is the chief of our Law Enforcement Hall. He&rsquo;s at rank one Half-God level. The person beside me is our grand elder. He&rsquo;s at rank two Half-God level.&rdquo;<br>Chu Guyu was a smart person. Seeing that Chu Feng was talking to her via voice transmission, she tactfully responded in the same manner.<br>&ldquo;May I ask your grand elder to discern the cultivation of the person standing beside me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked via voice transmission.<br>There was a moment of silence before Chu Guyu gave her response.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu, the elder beside you probably has a treasure on him. Our grand elder is unable to discern his cultivation level. Pardon me, but why don&rsquo;t you ask him yourself? Are the two of you not close to each other?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That would be an understatement. To be frank with you, I&rsquo;m currently his prisoner. I have been kidnapped by him,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Are you serious, young master Chu Feng?&rdquo; Chu Guyu asked in shock.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t dare to speak lightly of something like that,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, why don&rsquo;t you accompany me back to our Heavenwind Sword Sect. We&rsquo;ll ensure your safety.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart was set at ease upon hearing those words. It looked like Chu Guyu was willing to help him.<br>After a quick chat, Chu Guyu turned to Chu Feng and spoke aloud, &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, I believe that my grandfather will be interested to meet you. Are you willing to accompany us to our Heavenwind Sword Sect as a guest?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that. We still have business to attend to,&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy replied before Chu Feng could say a thing.<br>His voice sounded a little cold, hinting that he might have noticed something.<br>&ldquo;Miss Chu, you&rsquo;ll have my deepest gratitude if you can save me from this man,&rdquo; Chu Feng told Chu Guyu via voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, young master Chu Feng. Leave this to me,&rdquo; Chu Guyu replied.<br>Boom!<br>Boom!<br>The earth started quaking!<br>Terrifying oppressive might gushed forth from the two elders of the Heavenwind Sword Sect. They were both Half-God level cultivators, such that their oppressive might could easily decimate anyone from existence if they wished to.<br>They focused their oppressive might solely on the Netherworld Envoy, determined to suppress him.<br>It was just that the oppressive might came to a halt before it could even touch the Netherworld Envoy. The latter was already guarded against their attack, and he had used his own oppressive might to counter theirs.<br>From the aura that the Netherworld Envoy was emanating, Chu Feng could tell that the Netherworld Envoy was at the same cultivation level as the grand elder of the Heavenwind Sword Sect, rank two Half-God level.<br>That gave Chu Feng a boost of confidence.<br>As powerful as the Netherworld Envoy was, the Heavenwind Sword Sect had the advantage in terms of number. They might just be able to defeat the Netherworld Envoy.<br>&ldquo;Is this your doing, Chu Feng? Did you ask them for help?&rdquo;<br>The Netherworld Envoy glared at Chu Feng. He had already guessed what had happened.<br>&ldquo;Elder, please don&rsquo;t blame me for this. You know that I have urgent matters to attend to,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Unexpectedly, the Netherworld Envoy let out a cold sneer.<br>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask them whether they really dare to help you?&rdquo;<br>The Netherworld Envoy looked at the Heavenwind Sword Sect with scorn in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Arrogant! Do you think that our Heavenwind Sword Sect is a pushover? You need not dream of getting away scot-free today if you don&rsquo;t explain why you have kidnapped young hero Chu Feng!&rdquo; the grand elder of the Heavenwind Sword Sect said.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha! A mere Heavenwind Sword Sect dares to speak to me in such a manner? Take a closer look at who I am!&rdquo;<br>A tempest started to revolve around the Netherworld Envoy, reverting his veil and robe back to their normal state.<br>&ldquo;Y-you are from the Netherworld Sect?&rdquo;<br>Horror could be immediately seen on the faces of everyone from the Heavenwind Sword Sect, including the rank two Half-God level grand elder.<br>&ldquo;My deepest apologies, I was unaware of your true identity. If I had known that you were from the Netherworld Sect, I wouldn&rsquo;t have dared to get involved in your business.&rdquo;<br>The two Half-God level elders of the Heavenwind Sword Sect hurriedly retracted their oppressive might and apologized to the Netherworld Envoy. Even Chu Guyu had shut her mouth too.<br>&ldquo;Scram. Otherwise&hellip; I&rsquo;ll decimate your Heavenwind Sword Sect,&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy threatened coldly.<br>It took a mere split moment for everyone from the Heavenwind Sword Sect to disappear from the vicinity. The sight of that left Chu Feng feeling as if he was falling into the abyss.<br>He thought that he could finally be free of his quandary, but who could have thought that the Netherworld Sect was so feared even in the Totem Galaxy. All the Netherworld Envoy did was to reveal his identity, and the Heavenwind Sword Sect scrambled away without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you better dispel those thoughts from your mind. No one can change what I have decided on.&rdquo;<br>The Netherworld Envoy was feeling gleeful at having scared the members of the Heavenwind Sword Sect off. He turned to warn Chu Feng, but to his astonishment, Chu Feng had vanished from view.<br>To be exact, it wasn&rsquo;t that Chu Feng had vanished but that the space around him was morphing. The forest he was in and the mountain range in the distance had vanished from view, replaced with a layer of shrouding fog.<br>The fog had devoured the lands, making it impossible for him to see anything at all.<br>Soon, two figures emerged from the fog.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you?&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy remarked in surprise.<br>He had just met those two figures back in the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber. They were none other than the father and son who asked Chu Feng for Dragon Spring.<br>Yet, their disposition was now completely different from before despite being dressed the same. They emanated an intimidating pressure. Even the little boy was not to be looked down upon.<br>&ldquo;It looks like you have been concealing your strength. Speak, what business do you have with me?&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy asked.<br>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take that child with you,&rdquo; the middle-aged man said.<br>&ldquo;You want to interfere in my business too?&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy asked.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The middle-aged man chuckled softly under his breath before continuing, &ldquo;If I really intended to interfere in the Netherworld Sect&rsquo;s business, none of you would have been able to enter the Nine Souls Galaxy in the first place.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to come to blows with you today. Send Chu Feng back to the Nine Souls Galaxy. I&rsquo;ll permit you to take Song Yun away with you. As for that little girl, you&rsquo;ll have to hand her over. Neither her nor Chu Feng belongs to your Netherworld Sect.&rdquo;<br>The middle-aged man&rsquo;s words were calm and placid, but the certainty behind them made it clear that it wasn&rsquo;t a request but an order.<br>&ldquo;It looks like you&rsquo;re from the Nine Souls Galaxy? I&rsquo;ve been in the Nine Souls Galaxy for quite some time now, but I never thought that someone would dare to utter such arrogant words before our Netherworld Sect. I&rsquo;ll have you know that you have already angered me. You better get lost right now, or else&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Uwa!&rdquo;<br>The Netherworld Envoy let out a cry of agony before he could finish his words.<br>The world around him began to distort, and the Netherworld Envoy felt incredible pressure crushing down on him. It felt like his body and life were no longer under his control anymore.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the consequences of angering you are, but I suggest that you don&rsquo;t anger me,&rdquo; the middle-aged man replied calmly.<br>The Netherworld Envoy looked at the shabbily dressed middle-aged man carrying an ax on his back with eyes filled with fear. He finally understood that he didn&rsquo;t stand a chance against the man standing before him.<br>There was a world of difference in their strength!<br></p></div>
