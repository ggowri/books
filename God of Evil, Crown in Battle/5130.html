        <div>: Probably My Father<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Protective formation? What protective formation are you speaking of?&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly asked.<br>&ldquo;Hm? It can&rsquo;t be that you&rsquo;re unaware of it, are you?&rdquo;<br>The tall red-<br>man was surprised to hear that.<br>&ldquo;I am indeed unaware of the matter. Can you tell me more about it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s interesting. To be frank, we only sensed the protective formation inside you just as you were about to be killed. You really don&rsquo;t know who left the protective formation inside of you?&rdquo; the tall red-<br>man asked.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip; am indeed unaware of it.&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head. &ldquo;Does this protective formation trigger when my life is in danger?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes. It was already on the verge of triggering, but the Night Monarch was unable to sense it due to the severe regression of his cultivation,&rdquo; the tall red-<br>man said.<br>&ldquo;What would happen if the protective formation triggers?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;What would happen? Everything here, including the realm, will be reduced to ashes. You&rsquo;ll be the only one to survive the ordeal. It looks like you really don&rsquo;t know anything about yourself,&rdquo; the tall red-<br>man spoke with a teasing voice.<br>Chu Feng was surprised to hear that.<br>He was actually vaguely aware of the protective formation inside of him as the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted had told him about it. The latter asked him if there were any cultivators near True God level around him, to which Chu Feng replied no. The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted then burst into laughter and told him not to think too much into it.<br>He said that Chu Feng would know the truth when the time came.<br>Chu Feng spent a while thinking about it, and the most likely person behind the protective formation that he could think of was his father, Chu Xuanyuan. It was just a guess back then, and the formation had never surfaced ever since, so he didn&rsquo;t pay too much heed to it.<br>Yet, to his shock, the protective formation appeared to be much stronger than he had previously imagined. It actually wielded sufficient destructive power to eradicate an entire realm, which explained why these two unfathomably powerful red-<br>men were so apprehensive of it.<br>He couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder if it was really possible that he had such a protective formation inside him. While those two red-<br>men didn&rsquo;t look like they were joking, it didn&rsquo;t feel real to him since he couldn&rsquo;t sense the protective formation at all.<br>Thus, he asked, &ldquo;Are you certain that there&rsquo;s such a protective formation inside of me?&rdquo;<br>He wanted to verify this matter since he thought that it was of vital importance.<br>&ldquo;I have no reason to lie to you,&rdquo; the tall red-cloaked man replied.<br>He then turned around and prepared to take his leave.<br>&ldquo;Please wait a little longer!&rdquo; Chu Feng quickly stopped him once more. &ldquo;May I know if you&rsquo;re acquainted with those from the Netherworld Sect?&rdquo;<br>He was asking this out of curiosity. There were some differences between the attire of the Netherworld Envoy and these red-<br>men, but both of them were dressed in red and incredibly powerful.<br>He thought that it would be useful for him to learn more about the true powerhouses in the world of cultivation.<br>&ldquo;Netherworld Sect? Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The tall red-cloaked man merely scoffed in disdain before the two of them vanished into thin air.<br>The scoff of disdain was more than enough to answer Chu Feng&rsquo;s question. It was likely that they weren&rsquo;t related to the Netherworld Sect. In fact, the tall red-<br>man probably looked down on the Netherworld Sect.<br>This was an interesting piece of information, but Chu Feng was still more concerned with the protective formation inside of him.<br>Boom boom boom!<br>Before Chu Feng could give much thought to the matter, the hall suddenly began shaking. Cracks quickly crept across the wall, and it looked like the hall was about to collapse.<br>The Asura King immediately brought Chu Feng and the Asura World Spirit Army out of the tower. However, after leaving the tower, they quickly realized that it wasn&rsquo;t just the tower that was shaking but the entire realm.<br>The cracks covered not just the earth but the sky as well, and they were still swiftly growing with each passing second. Chu Feng immediately realized that the death of the Night Monarch must have destabilized the realm, inducing its internal collapse.<br>The collapse of the realm should have freed them from this prison, but it was happening in such a devastating manner that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t fully confident of it. To prevent any mishap, he told the Asura King to protect everyone in the vicinity with his power.<br>What Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know was that the red-<br>men actually didn&rsquo;t leave the area. They were standing not too far away in the sky, and behind them stood nearly a hundred other red-<br>men in a neat formation.<br>Compared to Chu Feng, these red-<br>men didn&rsquo;t look nervous or worried in the least. They didn&rsquo;t fear the collapse of the realm at all.<br>The tall red-<br>man from before had his eyes fixed on Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I never thought that the one here would be the Night Monarch. His cultivation actually regressed so much due to the injuries he had suffered back then. Our journey here wasn&rsquo;t in vain!&rdquo; the short red-<br>man spoke in excitement.<br>He glanced at the red-<br>men behind him and continued, &ldquo;All of you have done well. The Darknight Sacred River would have long closed if you didn&rsquo;t stall its opening. If so, young master Feng and I would have missed this window of opportunity.&rdquo;<br>It turned out that these red-<br>men were the ones who had been stalling the opening of the Darknight Sacred River so as to keep it from disappearing.<br>&ldquo;Elder Xuan, you&rsquo;re being too kind. We&rsquo;re only doing what we should,&rdquo; a middle-aged man amongst the red-<br>men replied.<br>The middle-aged man then turned to the tall red-<br>man and asked, &ldquo;Young master Feng, you seem to be very interested in Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>He was asking this as their organization usually avoided contact with other cultivators as much as possible. Even if it was to prevent the activation of Chu Feng&rsquo;s protective formation, Elder Xuan and young master Feng could have made a move in the shadows. Yet, they intentionally chose to show themselves.<br>This was a sign that they were interested in striking up a connection with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng has a name similar to mine, and he possesses extraordinary cultivation too. It hasn&rsquo;t been long since our last meeting, but his cultivation has already advanced by so much. I have never seen anything like that before. At this rate, he&rsquo;ll catch up with me within the next few years&hellip; though what surprises me the most is the defensive formation within him,&rdquo; young master Feng looked at Chu Feng as he spoke.<br>All of a sudden, he remembered something and turned to the middle-aged red-<br>man.<br>&ldquo;Elder Yu, you have been keeping tabs on the Ancestral Martial Starfield all this while, right? You should know quite a bit about Chu Feng then. Do you know the person who left the defensive formation within him?&rdquo; young master Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Young master Feng, I abide closely to the orders issued to me. I have heard of Chu Feng&rsquo;s deeds, but I have never looked into his background. I was unaware of the protective formation on him.<br>&ldquo;However, I have heard that his grandfather and father are highly talented cultivators. In particular, his father has reached an extremely high level of cultivation when he returned to the Ancestral Martial Starfield,&rdquo; the middle-aged man said.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; That piqued young master Feng's interest. &ldquo;Elder Yu, do you know how powerful his father is?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that is beyond my knowledge. I was also intrigued by Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s changes, so I tried following him to find out more. However, he seems to have noticed me and I quickly lost sight of him. I have never seen him ever since,&rdquo; the middle-aged man said.<br>&ldquo;I see. It would seem that the most likely person to have left that defensive formation in Chu Feng is his father.&rdquo;<br>Young master Feng looked at Chu Feng with interest. He knew better than anyone that Elder Yu was no pushover, but Chu Xuanyuan was still able to shake him off. This showed that Chu Xuanyuan was not someone to be made light of.<br></p></div>
