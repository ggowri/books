        <h1>Chapter 1751</h1>
        <div> - Fight For The Strongest<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Lord Baili, what are we to do?&rdquo; At this moment, Yin Chengkong and the others had expressions of fear and panic on their faces. They were unable to remain calm.<br>This matter was simply no small matter. Not only did it concern their lives, it also concerned the existence of the Cyanwood Mountain.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic. Regardless of who that person might be, he has only sent an invitation letter and has not actually done anything to us. This means that, at least for the time being, that person does not have any malice toward us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Else, that person would have been able to notify the people from the Four Clans and have them directly come to capture Chu Feng and me. There would be no reason for him to go through all this trouble,&rdquo; Baili Xuankong said.<br>&ldquo;Milord, what you said is very true,&rdquo; Hearing what Baili Xuankong said, Dugu Xingfeng and the others started to calm down slightly. However, they were still extremely uneasy.<br>After all, not only had that person entered their secret forbidden area, he had also left without alarming them at all.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what do you think of this matter?&rdquo; Baili Xuankong turned to ask Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Let me finish reading the contents of the invitation letter first,&rdquo; As Chu Feng said, he continued to read the invitation letter.<br>Chu Feng felt that, regardless of who that person might be, for him to come here and leave behind that invitation letter, it meant that he had some sort of objective. Likely, that objective should be written on the invitation letter.<br>After hearing what Chu Feng said, Baili Xuankong and the others came to a sudden realization. One by one, they started to smile bitterly. They thought to themselves in their hearts that they were actually less calm than a child. They had truly lived all these years in vain.<br>Although they were all smiling bitterly in their hearts, they turned their gazes onto the letter again.<br>After they continued reading the contents of the letter, Chu Feng and the others finally realized that whoever it was that had left the invitation letter had invited Chu Feng to participate in a &lsquo;Strongest Younger Generation Battle Assembly.&rsquo;<br>Not only was Chu Feng invited, there were other people invited as well. Furthermore, the invitation letter contained all the names and origins of the people invited.<br>Even though Chu Feng did not know some of the people, after Chu Feng read their origins, he knew that all of the people being invited were most definitely the strongest members of the younger generation in the Holy Land of Martialism right now.<br>Among them, the majority of the people being invited were disciples from the Heavenly Law Palace, the Mortal King Palace and the Underworld Palace. As for the others, they were the disciples of hidden experts. The Weaponry Refinement Immortal&rsquo;s personal disciple, Baili Xinghe, was also among the people invited.<br>A thing worthy of being mentioned was that only one person from the Four Great Imperial Clans was invited. That was the person who Chu Feng had defeated not long ago, Ximen Feixue.<br>This indirectly signified that only Ximen Feixue of the Four Great Imperial Clan&rsquo;s younger generation was qualified to participate in that Strongest Younger Generation Battle Assembly.<br>It must be said that if all of the people invited on the invitation letter were to show up, then the so-called Strongest Younger Generation Battle Assembly would be extremely extraordinary.<br>The Four Great Imperial Clans&rsquo; younger generation&rsquo;s sparring held at Mooncloud City would simply not be able to match up to this one at all.<br>If there was someone capable of obtaining first place in this Battle Assembly, it would mean that that person would really be the number one individual of all the younger generation in the Holy Land of Martialism right now.<br>As for what shocked Chu Feng the most, it was not this Battle Assembly. Rather, it was the person who had sent the invitations for this Strongest Younger Generation Battle Assembly.<br>While that person had not directly declared his name, he had left behind his title.<br>He was actually Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor.<br>&ldquo;Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor? It&rsquo;s actually Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor?&rdquo;<br>Reading till this point, the expressions on the faces of Baili Xuankong and the others all changed to those of amazement.<br>&ldquo;Ancestor, you know of this Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously. Judging by the expressions Baili Xuankong and the others had, it seemed that they had heard of Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor.<br>In fact, Chu Feng had also heard of this Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor himself. After all, he had only been able to obtain the power of the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram with the help of the Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor&rsquo;s strand of aura.<br>However, logically, Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor should have already died. Could it be that he was still alive?<br>&ldquo;During the period when you were being listed as wanted, a newcomer arrived in the Holy Land of Martialism. His reputation rose rapidly. He continuously challenged the disciples of experts, and won every match with absolute dominance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;His strength is extremely powerful and his talent is definitely heaven-defying. However, no one knows who he is. All they know is that he has declared himself to be Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor,&rdquo; Baili Xuankong said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, that Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor is also a member of the younger generation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in a surprised manner.<br>&ldquo;Mn, a member of the younger generation just like you. However, his reputation is even more magnificent than yours.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though your reputation has soared enormously after utterly defeating the Four Great Imperial Clans&rsquo; younger generation, it remains that Ximen Feixue was the only person with bearing among the Four Great Imperial Clans&rsquo; younger generation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for that Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor, the opponents he defeated were all at least of the same tier as Ximen Feixue. They are all the peak younger generation of the Holy Land of Martialism,&rdquo; Baili Xuankong said.<br>After hearing all this, Chu Feng had a rough idea of the general situation. This Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor was most definitely not the owner of that strand of aura. It was very possible that this Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor was that Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor&rsquo;s descendant.<br>&ldquo;However, with his ability, it should be absolutely impossible for him to charge into this place and leave the invitation letter behind without alarming anyone. It would seem that he possesses an extraordinary existence behind him too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is also no wonder as he, a mere member of the younger generation, has dared to challenge that many experts&rsquo; disciples without a care for the consequences,&rdquo; Baili Xuankong gasped with admiration.<br>&ldquo;Emperor Gong has been dead for so long. If he is truly Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor, then Emperor Gong&rsquo;s family must have continued to exist for a very long time. Merely&hellip; they have only decided to show up again now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, it would also not be surprising for him to have the backing of a powerful expert. After all, he is the person who obtained the strength of Emperor Gong,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, could you be implying that&hellip;?&rdquo; After hearing what Chu Feng said, Dugu Xingfeng and the others&rsquo; eyes all shone, and their expressions changed.<br>&ldquo;What Chu Feng is implying is that Emperor Gong has had successors the entire time. Furthermore, each generation will succeed the previous generation. This member of the younger generation with a magnificent reputation should be the Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor of the newest generation,&rdquo; Baili Xuankong explained.<br>&ldquo;But, Emperor Gong has been dead for so long. If he really possesses successors, they should have already shown themselves long ago. Why would they only show themselves now?&rdquo; Dugu Xingfeng and the others asked. Actually, they did not believe that Emperor Gong actually possessed successors. They felt that Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess was incorrect.<br>&ldquo;Truth be told, back when I was in the Alliance Domain, I came across a rare opportunity. At that time, the strand of an aura left behind by an expert senior helped me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the master of that strand of aura, he was precisely Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you serious?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Baili Xuankong and the others were all startled. The reason for that was because what Chu Feng had said was no small matter. If it was true, it would be extremely major.<br>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded. Then, he pondered for a moment and continued, &ldquo;Regarding this, I should have kept it a secret. However, everyone here is a senior I trust. Thus, I will say it to everyone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The founder of the Sealing Ancient Village personally met Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor. Not only that, he also obtained the graces of that Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor. Thus, the founder of the Sealing Ancient Village declared Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor as a grand person.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, in his records, he intentionally left these words: This grand person&rsquo;s ability is incomparable. It is likely that in the Holy Land of Martialism, this grand person is the strongest person besides Lord Emperor Qing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, that Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor was extremely low-profile, and he refused to have the founder of the Sealing Ancient Village mention this matter to anyone. Thus, very few people know about this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I felt that if that Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor had really obtained the strength of Emperor Gong, it would be very possible for him to continue to pass that down to future generations,&rdquo; Chu Feng explained.<br></p></div>
