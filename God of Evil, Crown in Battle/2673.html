        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Gifts<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>The request that Chu Feng made to the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief was related to Xian Miaomiao.<br>When Chu Feng left the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm and entered the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, he knew that Xian Miaomiao would one day enter the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm too.<br>Firstly, she was sufficiently talented enough to enter the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Secondly&hellip; she needed to find her mother.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng had given her two items. One was a key capable of making a breach in the formation barrier surrounding the Hundred Refinements Stage. As for the other, it was a Golden Flash Bird. Using that Golden Flash Bird, Xian Miaomiao could search for him upon entering the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>Merely, Chu Feng had been in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm for a long time already. Yet, there had been no news from Xiao Miaomiao at all. Chu Feng guessed that she should not have arrived at the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm yet.<br>However, Chu Feng had things to take care of, and could not continue to wait for Xian Miaomiao forever. That why was Chu Feng made a request of the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief.<br>He asked the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief to take note of Xian Miaomiao, and asked him to take care of her should he run into her.<br>As for the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief, he naturally accepted Chu Feng&rsquo;s request. After all, to him, Chu Feng was his master.<br>&ldquo;Who is that person?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, questioning words sounded from the vast crowd.<br>As that place was the Stairway to Heaven that led to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, very few people would generally show up there.<br>The reason for that was because that place was the place that was closest to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Thus, it became a sacred place for the people in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>However, at that moment, an old man wearing tattered clothes and covered in dust had appeared nearby.<br>If those with insufficient strength going there was already something disrespectful, then to arrive dressed as that old man was, would be absolutely disrespectful.<br>Inevitably, this caught the attention of the Hero City crowd.<br>Due to curiosity, Chu Feng also cast a glance over there. However, upon seeing the old man, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression immediately changed. He was shocked.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng knew that old man. He was the master of the Unknown Burial Ground.<br>Although he was dressed like one, he was not a beggar. Instead, he was an unfathomably powerful expert, a truly grand individual.<br>Upon seeing the old man, Chu Feng subconsciously walked toward him. He wanted to greet him.<br>Although Chu Feng had managed to clear the Unknown Burial Ground with his own ability, it remained that he obtained benefits from the old man. Thus, Chu Feng was very respectful toward the old man.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t come over! Don&rsquo;t come over!&rdquo;<br>Before Chu Feng could approach, that old man suddenly turned frantic. He shouted at Chu Feng to not approach him, and began to rapidly run away.<br>He had a very flustered appearance, and was actually unable to even stand straight. From time to time, he would tumble. However, he would immediately get back up and continue running away.<br>Chu Feng stood there, confused. He discovered that the situation seemed to be amiss and that the old man seemed to be affected by some sort of shock.<br>However, that place was the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Who could possibly shock him to a state like that?<br>Chu Feng started to ponder. However, he was unable to think of an answer.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, do you know that person? Could it be that he is someone who has offended you before? Should we go and capture him for you so that you can properly teach him a lesson?&rdquo; Lil&rsquo; Ball said after walking over.<br>Back then, Lil&rsquo; Ball had disliked Chu Feng because of how well Ying Mingchao treated him. He had even deliberately tried to make things difficult for Chu Feng in front of everyone.<br>However, after that calamity, not only did Lil&rsquo; Ball no longer feel any antipathy toward Chu Feng, but he was instead filled with admiration for Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng was looking thoughtfully at the direction where that old man had left. After a short while, he turned to Lil&rsquo; Ball and the others, &ldquo;You all must not go and provoke that man.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were all bewildered by Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. They all felt that tattered old man to be no different from a beggar.<br>However, what Chu Feng said caused the crowd to feel that that old man possessed a remarkable origin.<br>Naturally, that old man possessed a remarkable origin. He was the Exalted Sacred Tiger.<br>He was someone who could drown all these people to death with a mere spit.<br>He had merely become like this after being tortured by the Old Ape.<br>Of course, no one there knew that old man to be Exalted Sacred Tiger. Not even Chu Feng knew about his identity.<br>&ldquo;Remember his appearance. If you all are to encounter him again, you all must not attempt to provoke him,&rdquo; Chu Feng warned again. He had a very serious expression as he said those words.<br>He had no idea what that old man had encountered. However, he knew that old man&rsquo;s strength to be extraordinary. After all, that old man was the master of the Unknown Burial Ground.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng did not dare to rashly approach him even though he currently suffered from a confused mental state. As such, it would be extremely unwise for Lil&rsquo; Ball and the others to approach that old man.<br>&ldquo;Definitely.&rdquo;<br>Although Lil&rsquo; Ball and the others had no idea why Chu Feng was telling them to be careful of that old man, they all nodded at Chu Feng&rsquo;s warning. They did not dare to disobey Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, farewell,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to the crowd.<br>Then, together with Wang Qiang, Zhao Hong, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi, Chu Feng stepped onto the Stairway to Heaven.<br>That&rsquo;s right, it was not only Chu Feng, Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang. Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi, after reconciling with one another, also planned to enter the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, and decided to accompany Chu Feng and the others.<br>After all, they would be able to keep each other company by journeying together.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, please wait.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, an aged voice was heard. An old man was flying over from afar. And landed before the Stairway to Heaven.<br>That person was Grandmaster Prophet.<br>Originally, Chu Feng held ill feelings toward Grandmaster Prophet. After all, if it wasn&rsquo;t for his prophecy, the Kong Heavenly Clan would not have tried to kill him.<br>However, Grandmaster Prophet&rsquo;s prophecies actually ended up happening. For example, Grandmaster Prophet had accurately prophesied that calamity.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng really became the person to save everyone from the calamity.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, could it be that you&rsquo;ve managed to make a prophecy?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>After Chu Feng discovered that Grandmaster Prophet&rsquo;s prophecies were indeed trustworthy, Chu Feng entrusted Grandmaster Prophet to help him find traces of the Moon Immortal, as well as places where Ya Fei and the others might be. He wanted to know where he had to go to find them.<br>However, even after so many days had passed, Grandmaster Prophet was unable to make any prophecies regarding their whereabouts.<br>Seeing that Grandmaster Prophet was rushing over here, Chu Feng thought that Grandmaster Prophet had managed to prophesize something.<br>&ldquo;My apologies, this old man is incompetent, and was unable to make any prophecies,&rdquo; Grandmaster Prophet shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a light smile. Then, he asked, &ldquo;Then, Grandmaster, what might have brought you here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, this old man owes you. Thus, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to make it up to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I was unable to predict the whereabouts of your friends&hellip; I managed to predict things concerning you,&rdquo; Grandmaster Prophet said.<br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, after you reach the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, it is best to leave immediately, and proceed for other Upper Realms to train,&rdquo; Grandmaster Prophet said.<br>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I prophesied that you will encounter countless trials and tribulations after entering the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. It is going to be extremely dangerous, and you might even suffer a mishap and die in there.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To you, the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm is an ominous place. You absolutely cannot stay there for long,&rdquo; Grandmaster Prophet said.<br>The crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed enormously upon hearing those words. Then, they looked nervously at Chu Feng. Although they did not say anything, worry filled their eyes.<br>After all, they all knew very well that Grandmaster Prophet&rsquo;s prophecies were extremely accurate.<br>As for his current prophecy, it stated that Chu Feng would be met with countless trials and tribulations in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>&ldquo;Y-yo-you s-shut the fuck up!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What t-the fuck did you come here for? A-Are you here to dampen o-our mood?&rdquo;<br>Wang Qiang was angry. He walked out from the Stairway to Heaven and then grabbed Grandmaster Prophet. He was planning to beat him up.<br>Wang Qiang&rsquo;s reaction was also understandable. After all, they were filled with expectations for the journey to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. What Grandmaster Prophet said was simply equivalent to throwing a basin of cold water over Chu Feng. This was indeed dampening the mood.<br>&ldquo;Wang Qiang, let him go.&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng stopped Wang Qiang and rescued Grandmaster Prophet from Wang Qiang&rsquo;s grasp.<br>Compared to the furious Wang Qiang and the nervous crowd, Chu Feng remained very calm after hearing what Grandmaster Prophet said.<br>Chu Feng knew very well how dangerous the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was even without others telling him about it.<br>Thus, Chu Feng was not surprised at all by Grandmaster Prophet&rsquo;s prophecy.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, please don&rsquo;t worry. I have known from the very start that my journey to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm will not simply be filled with smooth sailing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In fact, I, Chu Feng, have never had a smooth journey ever since I stepped onto the road of martial cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, this is how the path of martial cultivation is. Even though I know that there are countless trials and tribulations ahead, I cannot retreat in the slightest.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, the path of martial cultivation is a path going against the heavens. If I want to obtain strength, I must fight against the heavens for it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Else, I will make no progress,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. What Lord Chu Feng said is correct.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, cries of applause sounded from the crowd. They were all cheering for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;However, Grandmaster Prophet, I must still thank you for reminding me. That said, Grandmaster Prophet, I am actually more curious about another thing than this. Might Grandmaster be willing to present to me an answer?&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Grandmaster Prophet.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, please ask away. As long as it is something that I know, I will definitely tell you,&rdquo; Grandmaster Prophet said.<br>&ldquo;Exactly who gave you your Prophecy Crystal Ball?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;...&rdquo; Grandmaster Prophet grew silent upon hearing those words. A difficult expression appeared on his face.<br>&ldquo;If it is too difficult, then you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>Chu Feng had heard from Grandmaster Prophet that his Prophecy Crystal Ball was given to him by a godly individual. It was precisely that Prophecy Crystal Ball that had changed his destiny.<br>However, it was likely that that godly individual had told Grandmaster Prophet to not mention him or her. Thus, Grandmaster Prophet did not wish to reveal who that person was to anyone.<br>Right at that moment, Grandmaster Prophet&rsquo;s voice transmission entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears. &ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, I can tell you. However, you must not tell others.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I do not know that godly individual&rsquo;s name, he once mentioned to me before that others addressed him as Exalted Heavenly Fate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My thanks,&rdquo; Chu Feng remembered the name.<br>Although Chu Feng had no idea who that person might be, he felt that the fact that that person possessed such a treasure and was willing to gift it to another meant that that person must be an extremely extraordinary individual.<br>Furthermore, his name was Exalted Heavenly Fate. Could it be that he was an Exalted-level expert?<br>If that was the case, it would be even more amazing.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, farewell. The future is long, we will definitely meet again.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng clasped his fist at the crowd again. Then, together with Zhao Hong, Wang Qiang, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi, Chu Feng stepped onto the Stairway to Heaven.<br>After stepping onto the Stairway to Heaven, Chu Feng began to ascend the steps reaching upward. Soon, he disappeared from the crowd&rsquo;s line of sight.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng and the others disappeared, the rocks that the crowd held in their hands suddenly started to emit light.<br>&ldquo;Snap~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Snap~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Snap~~~&rdquo;<br>Immediately afterward, those rocks all shattered like watermelons.<br>After those rocks shattered, the crowd discovered that there was a Cosmos Sack in each rock.<br>The crowd held the Cosmos Sacks and started to inspect them. It was only then that they discovered that the Cosmos Sacks contained a great amount of treasures.<br>At that moment, those people who had received rocks from Chu Feng started to look to one another. A pleasantly surprised expression filled their faces.<br>Originally, they had thought those rocks to be a simple parting gift. Never did they expect Chu Feng to give them such enormous gifts.<br>All the people who obtained rocks from Chu Feng were people who had previously befriended him.<br>Some among them had helped Chu Feng in the past, and others did not. However, Chu Feng still prepared gifts for them. The gifts that Chu Feng prepared for them were all different.<br>Those were meticulously prepared gifts. Not only were the things in the Cosmos Sacks capable of helping them in their present, but they would also help them in the future.<br>Those were gifts prepared personally for each and every one of them.<br>Xu Yiyi and the others who had befriended Chu Feng, regardless of their gender and age, were all tightly holding onto the Cosmos Sack given to them by Chu Feng, whilst emotions filled their hearts.<br>As for those who did not receive gifts from Chu Feng, they all had envious expressions on their faces.<br>Although they did not know what was in the Cosmos Sacks, they were able to guess from the reaction of those who had received the Cosmos Sacks that they most definitely contained precious gifts.<br><br></p></div>
