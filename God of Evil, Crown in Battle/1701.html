        <h1>Chapter 1700</h1>
        <div> - Lord Headmaster<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>At the moment when that voice sounded, a figure also appeared. When Chu Feng saw this person, he revealed a pleasantly surprised expression.<br>At this moment, a familiar face was standing before him. It was the Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster, Dugu Xingfeng.<br>Chu Feng did not know why Dugu Xingfeng would appear in this place. However, what he knew was that, at this moment, Dugu Xingfeng was already no longer a peak Half Martial Emperor, and had become a rank one Martial Emperor. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to block Beitang Zhiqiang&rsquo;s attack.<br>Dugu Xingfeng had reached a breakthrough!!!<br>&ldquo;Lord Headmaster,&rdquo; After a moment of excitement, Chu Feng uttered in alarm. He truly never expected for Dugu Xingfeng to save him. This was too much of a surprise.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you don&rsquo;t have to say anything anymore. Leave the rest to me,&rdquo; Dugu Xingfeng smiled. Then, he looked to Beitang Zhiqiang and said, &ldquo;The Beitang Imperial Clan actually colluded with Evildoer Tie, and was planning to massacre the entire Luo Family for a single bottle of Invisible Dew. If this matter were to spread out, I wonder what the people of the world would think?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Dugu Xingfeng, was it? I recognize you. Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster, isn&rsquo;t it? I truly never expected that Chu Feng would be a disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For such a barren place like the Cyanwood Mountain to have such a disciple, it is no wonder that you, a headmaster, would follow him closely to personally protect him,&rdquo; Beitang Zhiqiang said with a sneer. His tone was filled with mockery.<br>He was not only mocking Dugu Xingfeng. Rather, he was also mocking Chu Feng. Originally, with how talented Chu Feng was, he had thought that Chu Feng would be a personal disciple of a grand expert.<br>However, after all this, he was only a mere disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain. This caused Beitang Zhiqiang to look down on Chu Feng enormously. The reason for that was because in the eyes of the Four Great Imperial Clans, the Nine Powers were only second-rate powers that they did not place in their eyes at all.<br>&ldquo;Never would I expect that you would actually recognize me. That&rsquo;s quite rare indeed. However, what you said is very true.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For a talent like Chu Feng, I would naturally have to follow him closely to personally protect him. After all, even trash like Beitang Zimo requires that you to follow him closely to personally protect him, how could I not follow a talent like Chu Feng and personally protect him?&rdquo; As Dugu Xingfeng said those words, he looked to Beitang Zimo with a smile.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing those words, Beitang Zimo was so enraged that he started to gnash his teeth in anger and his complexion began to turn blue. No matter what, he was still a genius. Yet, he was actually being insulted and humiliated by others this many times in succession today. How could he not be enraged?<br>&ldquo;When I saw you last time, you were still only a peak Half Martial Emperor. If my guess is correct, you should&rsquo;ve just reached a breakthrough and become a Martial Emperor a while ago, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Having just reached a breakthrough, exactly how much of a Martial Emperor&rsquo;s abilities could you have possibly grasped? Did you really think that you would be able to match the two of us?&rdquo; Beitang Zhiqiang said mockingly.<br>&ldquo;How would you know that I am no match for you if you don&rsquo;t give it a try?&rdquo; Dugu Xingfeng smiled indifferently. Even though he knew that the longer one had been a Martial Emperor, the stronger one&rsquo;s strength would be, he still didn&rsquo;t place Beitang Zhiqiang in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;No wonder Chu Feng would dare to act this arrogant. It turns out that he actually has such an arrogant headmaster.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Evildoer Tie, there&rsquo;s no need for you to act. I&rsquo;ll teach this country bumpkin from the Cyanwood Mountain a lesson myself. I&rsquo;ll have him know the gap between Martial Emperors.&rdquo;<br>As Beitang Zhiqiang spoke, he indicated for Evildoer Tie to step back. Evildoer Tie and the others tactfully stepped back to present a battleground in the sky for Beitang Zhiqiang and Dugu Xingfeng.<br>&ldquo;In that case, allow me to experience the strength of your Beitang Imperial Clan.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, Dugu Xingfeng actually revealed an excited expression. Then his body shifted, and he soared into the sky and began to battle Beitang Zhiqiang.<br>&ldquo;Boom, boom, boom, boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Rumbles began to sound from all around. Martial powers were rampaging in the sky. The ferocious martial power surged forth like golden beasts as they wreaked havoc in the sky.<br>Before the might of the battle, the people from the Luo Family suffered enormously. Their cultivations were simply too weak. Even though the two Martial Emperors did not aim for them at all, the aftermath of their collisions was something that the people from the Luo Family were unable to bear.<br>However, Chu Feng was pleasantly surprised to discover that even though Dugu Xingfeng had just reached a breakthrough to Martial Emperor, he was not at a disadvantage when fighting against Beitang Zhiqiang. Instead, he had held the upper hand since the very beginning.<br>Dugu Xingfeng did not use any extravagant martial skills. Instead, with only fists and kicks, he was able to display overbearing might.<br>This came not only as a shock to Chu Feng; even Evildoer Tie was shocked. Logically, it shouldn&rsquo;t be possible for Dugu Xingfeng to be a match for Beitang Zhiqiang. After all, he had just reached a breakthrough to Martial Emperor.<br>There was only one explanation for how Dugu Xingfeng was able to surpass Beitang Zhiqiang; his talent for martial cultivation surpassed Beitang Zhiqiang&rsquo;s.<br>Suddenly, Beitang Zhiqiang spoke out. &ldquo;Evildoer Tie, attack together with me and exterminate this man.&rdquo; He had already realized that he was no match for Dugu Xingfeng. Even though he found it extremely embarrassing to say so, he still spoke to request help from Evildoer Tie.<br>Even though this was very disgraceful, he knew that it would be much better to bear the disgrace and seek help than to be defeated by Dugu Xingfeng.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip; this&hellip;&rdquo; However, facing Beitang Zhiqiang&rsquo;s request for help, Evildoer Tie started to hesitate. He did not dare to join the fight because he was still afraid.<br>He was not scared of Dugu Xingfeng. Instead, he was scared of the mysterious expert that had saved Chu Feng outside of the Heavenly Law Auction that day.<br>&ldquo;Evildoer Tie, you damned fool! If they possessed the help of an expert, he would&rsquo;ve shown himself already. Why would he dispatch this fellow to deal with us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You have moved about unhindered through the Holy Land of Martialism for all these years in vain! How could you be this stupid when it comes to this?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Quickly, join me! Kill this Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s country bumpkin together with me! We must settle this quickly!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Else, if we are to alarm those fellows in Mooncloud City, while I will be able to live, you&rsquo;ll definitely die!&rdquo; Beitang Zhiqiang shouted angrily.<br>After being incited by Beitang Zhiqiang, Evildoer Tie gnashed his teeth and shouted, &ldquo;Fuck it! your daddy will risk it all!&rdquo;<br>At this moment, heaven and earth started to sway and shake, and the weather began to change. All of this was caused by Evildoer Tie. In fact, not only had he affected heaven and earth and caused the weather to change, even his body began to change. He had turned into an enormous eagle capable of hiding the sky and covering the earth.<br>Flying in the sky, that eagle appeared to be made out of steel. It possessed an extremely ferocious appearance. It was Divine Power; Evildoer Tie had unleashed his Divine Power.<br>Evildoer Tie had gone all-out right at the get-go. He was planning to resolve this matter as quickly as possible, to kill Dugu Xingfeng as quickly as possible.<br>After Evildoer Tie joined the battle, a golden-bright and dazzling &lsquo;Imperial&rsquo; character started to shine on Beitang Zhiqiang&rsquo;s forehead.<br>With the unleashing of his Imperial Bloodline, Beitang Zhiqiang&rsquo;s aura instantly increased. The two men had both gone all-out as they charged toward Dugu Xingfeng to attack him together.<br>&ldquo;Perfect timing.&rdquo;<br>However, faced with the combined attacks from the two men, Dugu Xingfeng did not reveal any fear. Instead, he shouted loudly, and his body actually turned into a deep blue spear. Being one with the spear, Dugu Xingfeng unleashed a counterattack at Beitang Zhiqiang and Evildoer Tie.<br>That was no ordinary spear. Rather, it was a Divine Power. It turned out that Dugu Xingfeng was also a Divine Body. Furthermore, he had already grasped the essence of his Divine Power. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to unleash such powerful strength.<br>Dugu Xingfeng was truly powerful!!!<br></p></div>
