        <h1>Chapter 5203</h1>
        <div>: How Was It?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Another burst of black gaseous flames rose from the two clashing Asura World Spirits.<br>Chu Feng couldn't clearly see Eggy and Xue Ji crossing blows, but he was at least able to discern the two waves of black gaseous flame pushing against each other.<br>Those two waves were like demons fighting against each other. They were over a hundred thousand meters in height, nearly filling up this hall that could have easily housed millions of cultivators. The sheer strength they displayed left Chu Feng feeling a little uneasy.<br>He had never lost to anyone of the same cultivation rank as him, but he was certain that he wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance against Eggy and Xue Ji if he had fought them without resorting to the Heavenly Lightning Nine Slashes.<br>The clash between the two waves of black gaseous flames lasted for quite a while, reflecting just how intense the fight was. After all, there wasn&rsquo;t a huge gap in their strength.<br>Shoosh!<br>A shadow suddenly flew out from the black gaseous flames and was lodged into the walls by the side. Taking a closer look, it was Xue Ji&rsquo;s black sword.<br>Not too long after the sword flew out, the two waves of black gaseous flames started to dissipate. Eggy and Xue Ji&rsquo;s silhouettes reappeared.<br>It was not as if they had truly disappeared from the hall during this period of time, but they were moving so fast that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t able to discern them at all. It was only now that they had stopped that he was able to see them.<br>Chu Feng first turned to Eggy, worried that she was injured in the fight. His heart was only put at ease upon confirming that she was safe and sound.<br>Following that, he turned to look at Xue Ji and found that she wasn&rsquo;t too severely injured either. It was just that her right arm had a deep bloody gash.<br>&ldquo;The battle has been decided. Xue Ji&hellip; you aren&rsquo;t one to renege on your promise, are you?&rdquo; Eggy pointed her hand at Xue Ji as she spoke.<br>Her hand was so smooth that it looked as if it could have only come from a dainty young miss who couldn&rsquo;t even hold a knife. No one could have possibly imagined that it would be the hand of a little demoness who slaughtered without batting an eyelid.<br>&ldquo;I admit that you do possess some means, little girl. I have underestimated you. However, I won&rsquo;t lose to you again,&rdquo; Xue Ji said.<br>She grabbed the blue rock floating around her and tossed it to Eggy.<br>Shoosh!<br>Xue Ji raised her hand, and the black sword lodged into the wall flew back into her grasp. She then turned around and took her leave.<br>She didn&rsquo;t even spare a glance at Chu Feng while she was leaving. It was impossible to tell whether she was too embarrassed to face him after losing or that he had never meant a thing to her at all.<br>Once Xue Ji was gone, Eggy mischievously walked over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side and said, &ldquo;Here, I have gotten this back for you.&rdquo;<br>She handed the key-shaped blue rock over to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;My Eggy is the best,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Hoh, it looks like you have gotten brazen after I was away. I did you such a huge favor, but you aren&rsquo;t even going to call me Milady Queen?&rdquo; Eggy berated him with a reproachful pout.<br>Despite that, she still looked adorable.<br>&ldquo;Milady Queen.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng accommodated her before opening his arms wide.<br>&ldquo;Are you thinking of taking advantage of me?&rdquo; Eggy asked as she took a step back.<br>However, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t giving up in the least. He took one giant step forward and wrapped his arms around her, pulling her into his embrace.<br>&ldquo;You sure have gotten bold. You&rsquo;re even making a move on me without my permission now? Hurry up and let me go. Do you think I wouldn&rsquo;t smack you?&rdquo; Eggy protested despite not struggling in the least.<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t too worried because he knew that Eggy wouldn&rsquo;t actually attack him. A blissful smile emerged on his face as he relished in the sensation of having Eggy in his arms.<br>&ldquo;Enough, enough. How long are you going to continue hugging me? You don&rsquo;t want those Asura God Stones anymore? This Queen wants it even if you don&rsquo;t want it,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;Are you going into closed-door training again?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that anymore. I&rsquo;ve fully assimilated the energy inside the Asura God-Demon Stone,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;But there are so many Asura God Stones here,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;My constitution has changed after assimilating the Asura God-Demon Stones, so these Asura God Stones won&rsquo;t be of much use to me. You can leave them for Yu Sha. Speaking of which, don&rsquo;t you have your Asura World Spirit Army now? These stones probably won&rsquo;t be enough to go around,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>Even though she had been in closed-door training all this while, she was still well aware of everything that had happened to Chu Feng during this period of time.<br>&ldquo;Are these Asura God Stones of no use to you now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;They are, but not much. It&rsquo;ll be a waste for me to use them, so you can give it to the others instead,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll follow your words.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was regretful that these Asura God Stones weren&rsquo;t of much use to Eggy, but he was delighted to hear that she didn't have to go into closed-door training anymore and was able to keep accompanying him now.<br>He released Eggy from his embrace, took the blue rock from her, and started harvesting the Asura God Stones. Meanwhile, Eggy returned to his World Spirit Space.<br>Harvesting these Asura God Stones proved to be a greater challenge than the blue rocks as their protective formations were much more complicated. Chu Feng took significantly much more time on each of them, and he even started gasping for air and sweating profusely.<br>It reflected the difficulty of the task, considering Chu Feng&rsquo;s superior stamina and willpower.<br>However, he wasn&rsquo;t too bothered by it. Instead, he found joy in the process, knowing that these Asura God Stones would be of great use to Yu Sha and the Asura World Spirit Army.<br>In truth, the Asura God Stones wouldn&rsquo;t be useful to the Asura King and the others who had already reached Half-God level, but it did feel good to give back to them after all the help they had provided him.<br>It took a while, but Chu Feng finally harvested all of the Asura God Stones. He was so exhausted that he slumped onto the ground. His hands were trembling as he took out a few pill bottles from his Cosmos Sack to recover his energy.<br>Nevertheless, he had no intention of taking a break at all. Right after consuming those pills, he stood back up and prepared to leave the area.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you should rest for a little longer. Don&rsquo;t force yourself too much.&rdquo;<br>Eggy realized that Chu Feng was in a weak condition, and she felt bad for him.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. I&rsquo;ll recover soon after consuming the pills. I was still wondering what kind of traps were lying in wait here when Elder Tao Wu told me that this place was filled with dangers, but I guess what he was referring to was the protective formations around the Asura God Stones. I reckon that most juniors would have been unable to harvest those Asura God Stones,&rdquo; Chu Feng said jokingly.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you think that Xue Ji would call the Demon Spirit King over to camp at the entrance for us?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible. I should conceal myself then,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;The Demon Spirit King would have sealed off the entrance if he wished to capture you. You wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get away even if you concealed yourself,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;I can only hope that the Demon Spirit King is too busy to bother with me then,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>There was nothing he could do if an expert of the Demon Spirit King&rsquo;s caliber was really camping outside for him. Nevertheless, he still took all precautions and concealed himself before leaving the area.<br>As soon as he got out, he hastened his pace and rushed out of the pit as fast as he could. Halfway through the journey, he already knew that the Demon Spirit King wasn&rsquo;t camping for him. Otherwise, he would have already been caught by now.<br>As expected, he successfully left the pit without any trouble.<br>He didn&rsquo;t try to explore the other entrances leading to the six other spirit worlds, knowing that those weren&rsquo;t places that he could go. Thus, he obediently heeded Tao Wu&rsquo;s instruction and waited outside for them.<br>&ldquo;It would be good if there weren&rsquo;t so many Half-God level cultivators here,&rdquo; Eggy said with an expectant yet regretful sigh.<br>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rsquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Because&hellip; Forget it, this Queen shan&rsquo;t tell you just yet,&rdquo; Eggy replied mischievously.<br>Chu Feng sensed that there was something wrong with Eggy&rsquo;s mood, so he quickly pressed on with the matter.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, what&rsquo;s wrong? Tell me.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
