        <h1>Chapter 5406</h1>
        <div><span>: Miss Li Wu</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Nianqing, did that person say that our little young master has obtained the legacy of the Divine Inheritance Ground?&rdquo; Shuang Xue asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Indeed. My grandson has achieved something that even his mother has failed to do. It looks like he might just surpass us all,&rdquo; Lord Nianqing said with a beaming smile filled with pride.</span><br><span>Shuang Xue also smiled as well. She was happy for her master. She didn&rsquo;t know the specifics of what had happened, but it was clear that even Lord Nianqing had benefited from his halo.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Shuang Xue, I&rsquo;m glad to learn that my grandson is talented, but I&rsquo;m still worried about him. Look for him in my stead and make sure to keep him safe,&rdquo; Lord Nianqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Rest assured, milord. I won&rsquo;t let anyone harm our little young master even at the cost of my life!&rdquo; Shuang Xue vowed.</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing were on their way to another realm.</span><br><span>Chu Feng had neglected to ask Bai Yunqing about what he was going to do in order to avoid burdening him. He didn&rsquo;t think that he was a kind person, but he was still more than willing to help the people he cared about.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, if you have other matters to attend to, you should go on ahead,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing suddenly said with a smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me. I&rsquo;ve already agreed to come along with you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;On second thoughts, it isn&rsquo;t an important matter either. I can settle it myself,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>Chu Feng chuckled softly and said, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem like you&rsquo;re taking me as your brother.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing was baffled to hear those words.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t probe since I&rsquo;d have helped you no matter what you needed me for, but I&rsquo;m starting to get curious now that you&rsquo;re being so indecisive. What&rsquo;s the trouble you&rsquo;re facing now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, I&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Yunqing didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng had already seen through his thoughts, and that made him even more embarrassed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Out with it if you really think of me as a brother. I&rsquo;ll shoulder your burdens with you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How could I not think of big brother Chu Feng as my brother? I, Bai Yunqing, don&rsquo;t have many friends. You&rsquo;re the only true friend I have,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Then stop hesitating and tell me what&rsquo;s going on. I&rsquo;ll help you if it&rsquo;s within my strength. Otherwise, we can think of a solution together,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing finally cast aside his hesitation and revealed the truth to Chu Feng.</span><br><span>It turned out that Bai Yunqing had previously visited the Bloodline Galaxy together with his master to explore a remnant, but a single careless maneuver resulted in him sustaining some injuries and being separated from his master.</span><br><span>Up to this point, Chu Feng thought that Bai Yunqing was going to bring him to explore this remnant, but the latter suddenly changed his tone and asked, &ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, do you believe in love at first sight?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in love at first sight, though I do think that lust at first sight is a thing,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Ah&hellip;&rdquo; Bai Yunqing was rendered speechless.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo; Chu Feng burst into laughter. &ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what the starting point is. Be it lust, appearance, or personality, those are opportunities for two individuals to be drawn to each other. Lust is not necessarily a bad thing. Besides, there are plenty of good-looking people out there. It&rsquo;s not as if you&rsquo;re drawn to each and every one of them, right?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Right! Of the beautiful women in the world, she&rsquo;s the only one who could make my heart race like a wild horse!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing nodded vehemently.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes yes. I presume that you&rsquo;re mentioning this because you met someone who </span><span>enraptured you after you were separated from your master?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, big brother Chu Feng!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing continued nodding vehemently.</span><br><span>It turned out that in the midst of looking for his master, Bai Yunqing met a young lady whom he fell in love with at first sight. He obstinately clung to her in hopes that she would warm up to him, but the latter was a cold-natured person who was only revulsed by his obstinacy. She wasn&rsquo;t even willing to speak to him.</span><br><span>In the end, Bai Yunqing secretly followed the young lady back to her residence, where he learned that her name was Li Wu. Through his observation, he learned that she had no family members and resided alone in the forest. She was often alone, but he struggled to find a chance to approach her particularly because she didn&rsquo;t have a good impression of him.</span><br><span>Thus, he continued to secretly stalk her.</span><br><span>Li Wu was actually a highly talented individual who didn&rsquo;t pale in comparison to him, but during a training session, she encountered a beast from the Ancient Era far stronger than her. Bai Yunqing wasn&rsquo;t confident about subduing the beast too, but knowing that this was the opportunity of a lifetime, he charged in to save her.</span><br><span>He sustained injuries as a result of that battle, but through his sheer tenacity, he managed to subdue the beast and save Li Wu. His willingness to put his life on the line for her improved the latter&rsquo;s impression of him, and that was how they got acquainted.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing had once proposed having Li Wu come under his master&rsquo;s tutelage, but the latter rejected the suggestion, saying that she wanted to quietly cultivate in her residence. He chose to respect her decision, and shortly after, he left her to look for his master.</span><br><span>Some time later, Bai Yunqing had the opportunity to visit Bloodline Galaxy once more, so he naturally paid Li Wu a visit. To his horror, the latter had fallen terribly ill. He tried to heal her, but it was to no avail. Out of desperation, he even pleaded with his master to help her, but the latter merely took a glance at her before dragging him away.</span><br><span>His master warned him to never step into that Ancient Era forest and look for Li Wu ever again, or else he would punish him.</span><br><span>When Bai Yunqing asked about the reason, his master told him that there was a highly dangerous existence dwelling in the Ancient Era forest whom even he was unconfident of dealing with.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing had always heeded his master&rsquo;s orders, so he never looked for Li Wu ever again. However, now that he was in the vicinity of Bloodline Galaxy, his heart began to waver as he felt the urge to visit Li Wu once more. He was even willing to be punished by his master if that was what it took for him to meet her.</span><br><span>He knew that Chu Feng possessed extraordinary means, so he wanted the latter to take a look at Li Wu&rsquo;s condition.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not sure whether you should bring me there or not because that place is dangerous?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. My master wouldn&rsquo;t lie to me, and I have also sensed something is amiss </span><span>about that Ancient Era forest. To be honest, Miss Li Wu&rsquo;s illness was rather peculiar too&hellip; I think that there&rsquo;s a high chance that we&rsquo;ll meet with danger there. Big brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m the one who is fond of Miss Li Wu. I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s right for me to implicate you in this,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>He was hesitant to put Chu Feng in a precarious position.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Stop being so wishy-washy. I&rsquo;ll just ask you one question. Are you really fond of Miss Li Wu?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, I really like her. I know that I often talk nonsense, but she&rsquo;s the only person that has ever caught my interest,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What are you waiting for? Lead the way then. How can I possibly turn a blind eye when my future sister-in-law is ill? What you should do right now is rack your brain and think of everything you can do to cure the person you love,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing shook away his hesitations and led the way.</span><br><span>Along the way, Chu Feng had attempted to enter his World Spirit Space several times in hopes of figuring out the situation with the Asura Sword, only to have his psyche furiously devoured each and every time. It looked like he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to dwell in his World Spirit Space for an extended period of time as long as the Asura Sword was in there.</span><br><span>It was a huge relief that the Asura Sword didn&rsquo;t inflict any harm on Eggy and Yu Sha.</span><br><span>Soon, Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing finally arrived at the Ancient Era forest. The forest was unbelievably humongous, but nothing aside from that felt particularly out of place. Chu Feng even activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eye, but he didn&rsquo;t notice anything peculiar.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing led them to a small courtyard consisting of a single room. The courtyard had an architectural style reminiscent of that of the Ancient Era. There were no formations protecting the building, so Chu Feng was able to tell that there was no one inside the room.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh no. Did something bad happen to Miss Li Wu?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing flew into a fluster.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The power of love must have eroded your rationality. There are clear signs that someone has been here recently. Enter the room and see if Miss Li Wu&rsquo;s aura is there. If so, it should mean that she&rsquo;s just out for the moment,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said before making his way toward the room.</span><br><span>It was then that Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing sensed a presence rushing in their direction. They turned their heads around and saw a gorgeous woman with a frosty face, though her blue dress toned down her frigid disposition, making her a little more approachable.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Miss Li Wu.&rdquo; Bai Yunqing rushed forward to greet the woman.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I can say for certain that&rsquo;s lust at first sight.&rdquo; Eggy was amused by how proactive Bai Yunqing was at the sight of beauty.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why are you here again?&rdquo;</span><br><span>However, Li Wu responded coldly to Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s proactiveness, even revealing a hint of revulsion.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Miss Li Wu, I&rsquo;m worried for you. How are you feeling?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Whether I&rsquo;m ill or not has nothing to do with you. Please don&rsquo;t bring anyone to my place!&rdquo; Li Wu said before marching into the room, not bothering to engage Bai Yunqing or Chu Feng at all.</span><br><span>However, Chu Feng noticed that Li Wu had spared him a glance to assess him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Wu!&rdquo;</span><br><span>All of a sudden, Li Wu clutched her chest, and her body began convulsing. She gritted her teeth, but her warped face still reflected how much pain she must be experiencing.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Miss Li Wu!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing rushed forward to support her.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Get lost!&rdquo; Li Wu exerted her oppressive might to push Bai Yunqing back. She was a rank one Half-God level, which was outstanding considering her young age.</span><br><span>Chu Feng began earnestly assessing Li Wu in hopes of uncovering the cause of her illness, but he soon noticed something that caused his face to darken.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That is&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>Black feathers had started growing out of Li Wu&rsquo;s body as her pain intensified, and that black feather was something Chu Feng recognized!</span><br></p></div>
