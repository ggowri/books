        <h1>Chapter 1314</h1>
        <div> - Can Speak, Can Do<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>Chu Feng completely ignored their curses and insults and instead continued to wholeheartedly heal Lil Ming and Li Xiang.<br>Through his focused treatment, Lil Ming and Li Xiang soon regained their consciousness.<br>&ldquo;Junior brother Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior brother Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>When Li Xiang and Lil Ming opened their eyes to discover Chu Feng before them and their bodies completely healed, they felt as if they were dreaming.<br>However, when they saw the pool of blood below their bodies, as well as their torn clothes, they knew that everything was true. They had indeed been tormented by those disciples. However, they had been healed by Chu Feng now.<br>&ldquo;Junior brother Chu Feng, quickly, you have to go. They&rsquo;re coming to&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At this moment, Li Xiang hurriedly warned Chu Feng. As he spoke, he even turned his gaze toward senior brother Shao. His gaze was filled with resentment; it was clear that he knew that senior brother Shao had given the communication talisman to those people, that he had sold Chu Feng out.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anymore, I know about it already,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled lightly.<br>Then, with a very apologetic tone, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caused you two suffering. However, I will help you obtain justice. The dignity that they have taken from your bodies, I will personally retrieve for you. The suffering that they have caused you, I will return with interest.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Obtain justice? Retrieve dignity? You truly are one to boast.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you have that ability, why didn&rsquo;t you show up earlier? If you have that ability, why don&rsquo;t you go and find them? It is only when they are not here that you dare to speak such boasting words like that,&rdquo; Senior brother Shao refuted in a mocking manner.<br>&ldquo;Uncle Shao, what are you saying? How could you speak to senior brother Chu Feng in such a manner? He just saved our lives,&rdquo; Lil Ming said.<br>&ldquo;Saved your lives? Isn&rsquo;t he the person who harmed you in the first place? How could you be speaking up for him and not speaking up for me? All these years, have I treated you well in vain?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are truly an ingrate. If I knew you were going to be like this, I wouldn&rsquo;t have brought you back with me. Instead, I should have let your enemy find you so that you could be killed like the rest of your family,&rdquo; Senior brother Shao angrily denounced Lil Ming.<br>&ldquo;Senior brother Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t bother with him. He has gone mad and is not the uncle Shao that I know.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior brother Chu Feng, quickly, you must go. Earlier, uncle Shao told those people that it was you who restored my body and that it was you who was provoking them. He has pushed all of the blame onto you. Right now, those people are trying to find you,&rdquo; Lil Ming urged Chu Feng. He who was very naive actually spoke all that had happened to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, junior brother Chu Feng, you must leave this place. This time around, it is not only the disciples from the Copper Bamboo Forest and the Iron Bamboo Forest that have come. Even the disciples from the Silver Bamboo Forest and the Golden Bamboo Forest have come. There are many Martial King-level experts among them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They even dared to cripple me. There is simply nothing that they fear. If they are to encounter you, they will definitely not let you get away,&rdquo; At the same time, Li Xiang also began to urge Chu Feng to leave.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng turned to Lil Ming and asked, &ldquo;Lil Ming, do you still remember what I said to you before?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I do. Senior brother Chu Feng, you said that when you&rsquo;re there, you will not allow anyone to harm me, and that you will protect my dignity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, when you&rsquo;re not present, I must protect my own dignity and cannot allow it to be trampled upon by others. Even if I am to be beaten, I must not beg for forgiveness.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior brother Chu Feng, rest assured, Lil Ming did not disappoint you. Even though it was very painful, I did not beg, I did not say a single sentence asking for forgiveness.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if my dignity is lost, I did not throw away it myself. At the most, it has been trampled by others,&rdquo; Lil Ming replied with a chuckle. He seemed to be proud of his actions.<br>&ldquo;Lil Ming, you&rsquo;ve done well. However, senior brother Chu Feng is here now. Thus, I will take your dignity back from them,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo; Lil Ming was still very worried. He feared that Chu Feng would not be a match for those people.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no but. I, Chu Feng, am one to keep my word,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he placed his hand into his Cosmos Sack. After that, as his Cosmos Sack flickered with light, he took out the binding spirit formation.<br>When they saw the binding spirit formation in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand, Lil Ming, Li Xiang and everyone present was stunned.<br>That was because they seemed to be hearing faint voices of humans from the sphere that shone with light.<br>Right at this moment, Chu Feng threw his binding spirit formation onto the ground. With a &lsquo;bang,&rsquo; the binding spirit formation shattered.<br>At this moment, light began to flicker, and human figures, the thirty-five disciples from the four bamboo forests, emerged before everyone&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;Holy shit, they&rsquo;ve returned!!!&rdquo;<br>When they saw these people, the crowd from the Discarded Bamboo Forest were all frightened. It was not only senior brother Shao and the rest, even Li Xiang and Lil Ming were greatly frightened.<br>In fact, after being violently tormented by them, the fear that Li Xiang and Lil Ming had toward them was greater than anyone else.<br>&ldquo;Let us go, please, let us go.&rdquo;<br>However, right at this moment, a shocking scene appeared. After those people appeared, they actually all kneeled before Chu Feng and began to kowtow and beg him for forgiveness.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, the crowd from the Discarded Bamboo Forest were all stunned. Especially that senior brother Shao, who simply did not dare to believe his eyes.<br>These people that were acting like fiends, these people who spoke of teaching Chu Feng a lesson earlier, were actually kneeling and begging him like grandsons.<br>Exactly what was going on? This was simply unreasonable.<br>One must know that among these people were disciples from the Golden Bamboo Forest and the Silver Bamboo Forest, experts with the cultivations of Martial Kings.<br>&ldquo;The people that you should be kneeling toward are not me, it should be them,&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed to Lil Ming and Li Xiang.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry, we&rsquo;re sorry. It was us in the wrong before. We shouldn't have humiliated you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Please, we beg of you, seeing that we are all fellow disciples, please forgive us.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, those people did not dare to hesitate in the slightest. Immediately, they turned to Li Xiang and Lil Ming and began to kowtow.<br>It was not that they did not have any dignity. Instead, it was that they did not dare not to kowtow and beg for forgiveness. After experiencing Chu Feng&rsquo;s abilities, they already realized that Chu Feng was a very powerful expert, a very frightening existence.<br>It was likely that someone like him had some sort of aim by becoming a disciple of the Discarded Bamboo Forest.<br>As for people with a special aim, they would not be people who planned to stay in the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest. Thus, they felt that it was entirely possible that Chu Feng would kill them.<br>Faced with a person such as Chu Feng, how could they not be afraid? When Chu Feng said one, they would not dare to say two, and they would do whatever he wanted them to do.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Seeing the people that had tormented them earlier kneeling before their eyes, kowtowing and begging for forgiveness, both Lil Ming and Li Xiang were stunned.<br>After they took a glance at one another, they both looked to Chu Feng. They wanted to seek an answer from Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;They pinched apart the communication talisman that I had given you. I knew that something might have happened to you all so I rushed back. However, when I arrived, I was met with them instead.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Seeing the bloodstains on their clothes, I realized that something must&rsquo;ve happened to you all. Thus, I captured them,&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke of what had happened.<br>When they heard what Chu Feng said and saw the reaction from those people, the crowd from the Discarded Bamboo Forest were all stunned. Expressions of shock and astonishment filled their faces.<br>Lil Ming and Li Xiang were relatively better. At this moment, the only sensation that they were feeling were admiration and adoration for Chu Feng. They felt that Chu Feng was truly powerful, and they were surprised that he was actually able to subdue even Martial Kings.<br>However, for senior brother Shao and the other disciples of the Discarded Bamboo Forest, they were feeling an extremely complicated emotion. They had thought that Chu Feng was also a coward like them and was trash that would say one thing and do another.<br>Yet now, they realized that that was simply not the case. They were all wrong. Not only was Chu Feng not trash, he was someone who would do what he said.<br>Not only did he possess the strength to deal with these people, he even captured them, brought them back and had them kowtow toward Lil Ming and Li Xiang to beg for forgiveness. This sort of courage surpassed their imagination.<br>&ldquo;Putt&rdquo; Suddenly, senior brother Shao fell to the ground on his butt. His body began to tremble, and his complexion turned pale. Beads of sweat the size of peas were rolling down his body like rain drops.<br>The courage that he had had earlier disappeared instantly, as if he had lost all of his strength, like a dying dog, he sat on the ground.<br>He was afraid, extremely afraid. He was afraid because of all the things he had said about Chu Feng earlier.<br>He was regretful, regretful to the extreme. He was regretting that he had looked at others with his spiteful dog eyes and publicly humiliated Chu Feng.<br>However, in the end, Chu Feng was actually such a powerful character. He was so powerful that even the evildoers had to kneel before him and admit their mistakes.<br>However, even though he was afraid, even though he was regretful, he knew that all that was too late.<br>With how powerful Chu Feng was, so powerful that even the evildoers feared him, senior brother Shao was able to imagine what sort of consequences he would meet with.<br>He had offended an enormously devilish person who even the people that he felt to be evildoers did not dare to offend. He was so enormously afraid that he was at a loss as to what to do.<br></p></div>
