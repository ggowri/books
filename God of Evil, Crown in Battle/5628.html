        <h1>Chapter 5628: The Basis of Chen Hui’s Confidence</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The duo from the Immortal Spirit Manor didn&rsquo;t bother interacting with Chu Feng and Chen Hui anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the elder finally arrived, the two of them bowed to them. Surprisingly, the elder also bowed back to them, saying with a smile, &ldquo;Young master Zhao, young miss Song, what brings the two of you here?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder&rsquo;s attitude hinted at their extraordinary standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;We heard rumors about a prodigy here, so we came here to take a look. What a pity&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure if he&rsquo;s truly a prodigy or not, but he&rsquo;s an extremely arrogant man. Such a person would only soil the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s reputation,&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder didn&rsquo;t answer those words. Instead, he took out a bamboo container and began collecting Chu Feng&rsquo;s crops. Soon, 110 World Spiritist Pearls dropped out from the other end of the bamboo container.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This had been the number of World Spiritist Pearls Chu Feng had received in the past few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Song Yuping and Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> narrowed their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt conflicted witnessing it in person despite having heard the rumors. Lauded as prodigious world spiritist prodigies from a young age, they felt uncomfortable seeing that someone had deciphered a secret they struggled with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the same time, they felt admiration for Chu Feng, as they subconsciously realized that he was no ordinary person. Unfortunately, their admiration was fleeting as it was quickly replaced with envy and hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder handed the World Spiritist Pearls to Chu Feng before collecting Chen Hui&rsquo;s crops. Surprisingly, a huge amount of World Spiritist Pearls fell from the bamboo container. All in all, there were 60 of them. It was an amazing feat even though it was far from matching Chu Feng&rsquo;s record.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That fatty actually grasped the secret too? Did Chu Feng tell him?&rdquo; Song Yuping was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What are you saying? I figured it out myself. You may ask Chu Feng if you don&rsquo;t believe me,&rdquo; Chen Hui said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, he comprehended it himself,&rdquo; Chu Feng confirmed Chen Hui&rsquo;s claim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> smiled once more, but it was directed at Chen Hui this time around. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that young master Chen Hui would be this talented. I apologize for my hasty judgment earlier.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chen Hui replied with a grin, &ldquo;Heh, let&rsquo;s not bother with that. We&rsquo;re adults here, so let&rsquo;s cut the </span><span>hypocriticism</span><span>. Why don&rsquo;t you tell me how much you&rsquo;re willing to offer for my secret? Let me see how much your sincerity is worth.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> pulled a Cosmos Sack from his Cosmos Sack and tossed it toward Chen Hui. By touching the Cosmos Sack, Chen Hui could sense the treasures inside it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Oh? I&rsquo;d expect no less from the Immortal Spirit Manor&rsquo;s young master. You sure are generous,&rdquo; Chen Hui replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> was also gleeful to see how satisfied Chen Hui was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young master Chen Hui, our Immortal Spirit Manor has always been fond of making friends. This is only the start. You can expect to receive more from our Immortal Spirit Manor in the future&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> suddenly froze up halfway through his words, as Chen Hui had thrown the Cosmos Sack back to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What do you mean by this, young master Chen Hui?&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand? I&rsquo;m not selling my secret,&rdquo; Chen Hui replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Is it too little? We can negotiate.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken. I had no plans to sell the secret from the very start.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Then what did you mean why you mentioned that you knew the secret earlier too?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just stating a fact. I do indeed know the secret. Did I mention at any point that I would sell the secret to you?&rdquo; Chen Hui even turned to Chu Feng to confirm his words. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; Chen Hui exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao&rsquo;s</span><span> face darkened. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re toying with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course not. What made you think that I&rsquo;m toying with you? I&rsquo;m just showing you </span><span>the full extent of your stupidity,&rdquo; Chen Hui replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re courting death!&rdquo; Song Yuping exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She exerted her spirit power as a Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, but she was stopped by Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>. The latter glanced at the elder. He had only held back so far out of respect for the elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not to say that the elder was an amazing person, but he was from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, after all. That, in itself, demanded respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Chen Hui was the one who took Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> for a ride, he still shifted his gaze from Chen Hui to Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The ignorant sure is fearless. Chu Feng, do you think that you can act as you please just because you have some talent? The world of cultivation does value talent, but only those who are far superior to everyone else can afford to act as they please. You don&rsquo;t know your place as a junior. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before someone puts you back in place,&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether we&rsquo;ll be put in place or not, but that&rsquo;s not something for your Immortal Spirit Manor to decide. Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span>, I agree with your words, but I&rsquo;ll return them to you as well. There&rsquo;s always a taller mountain out there.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I see now that birds of the same feather flock together. You&rsquo;ll know very soon what kind of person I am,&rdquo; Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> sneered before leaving with Song Yuping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Chen Hui, the two of you are highly talented. I have no doubt that you&rsquo;ll achieve decent results in the entrance examination. However, Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> does have considerable backing. It&rsquo;ll be best for you to settle your conflict with him as soon as possible lest you bring trouble upon yourselves,&rdquo; the elder said before leaving the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Chu Feng and Chen Hui were the only ones left in the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You have guts.&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only thing I have,&rdquo; Chen Hui replied gleefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the background of the Immortal Spirit Manor?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He praised Chen Hui&rsquo;s guts because the latter snubbed Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> despite knowing about the Immortal Spirit Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The Immortal Spirit Manor is a power not to be made light of. It&rsquo;s a subordinate power of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,&rdquo; Chen Hui replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had nurtured seven powers in the Seven Realms Galaxy, namely the Beast Spirit Manor, Ghost Spirit Manor, Immortal Spirit Manor, Buddha Spirit Manor, Demon Spirit Manor, and Asura Spirit Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other than the Asura Spirit Manor, which was directly under the command of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, the remaining spirit manors dominated a starfield each and developed in the same trajectory as most powers. They served the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion even though they weren&rsquo;t considered to be part of them. Needless to say, their greatest backer was also the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their strength and formidable backing made them one of the top powers of the world of cultivation, second only to the galaxy overlords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Immortal Spirit Manor was the strongest spirit manor aside from the Asura Spirit Manor, which explained the overwhelming confidence Zhao </span><span>Tian&rsquo;ao</span><span> and Sogn Yuping </span><span>had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You dared to offend the Immortal Spirit Manor despite knowing their background. You must have quite the backing yourself too,&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Chen Hui replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;May I know which power you are from?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not convenient for me to reveal my backing, but a mere Immortal Spirit Manor means nothing to me at all,&rdquo; Chen Hui replied in glee.</span></p></div>
