        <h1>Chapter 3073</h1>
        <div> - The Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s Ruler<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You dare to continue to laugh? Are you truly looking down on our Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Hanpeng, I request that you immediately punish this man and expel him from our Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Else, what are we to do if our clansmen all begin to act like him?&rdquo; Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Hanpeng, please punish this man severely, and return justice to our two Supreme Elders,&rdquo; the elders kneeling on the ground also began to plead for Chu Hanpeng to severely punish Chu Youyuan.<br>&ldquo;Very well, come at me. Go ahead and use our clan&rsquo;s laws to punish this old man. I shall see who will dare to punish me today,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan suddenly waved his sleeve, and then stood there with his hands behind his back.<br>&ldquo;To look down on our clan, your crime is worthy of death. Today, I will eliminate you on behalf of our Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let us join hands and eliminate this traitor to our clan.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather and Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather both soared into the sky. With their weapons in hand, they flew toward Chu Youyuan.<br>With Chu Hanpeng refusing to act, the two of them had decided to take things into their own hands, and rushed forth to attack Chu Youyuan.<br>Chu Hanpeng did not attempt to stop them.<br>Chu Youyuan was indeed acting too excessively. His actions had already brought forth the anger of their clansmen.<br>The reason why Chu Hanpeng did not do anything was all because he took their Lord Clan Chief into consideration. After all, Chu Youyuan was their Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s trusted aide.<br>However, Chu Hanpeng did not stop Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather and Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather either.<br>It was already very lenient for him to not personally reprimand Chu Youyuan. As such, he would naturally not stop them.<br>If he were to stop them, he would instead cause greater anger and unrest within the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>In the blink of an eye, the two Supreme Elders arrived before Chu Youyuan. Their weapons were thrust toward Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s vital areas.<br>The old lady did not attempt to stop the two Supreme Elders either. After all, she did not know Chu Youyuan. Even though they were both acting to stand up for Chu Feng, the old lady, based on her temperament, would not bother to save Chu Youyuan.<br>After all, she simply did not care about Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s life and death. All she cared about was Chu Feng&rsquo;s life and death.<br>That said, what was most astonishing was that Chu Youyuan was standing there motionlessly with his hands behind his back when faced with these attacks from the two Supreme Elders. He seemed to not care about their attacks at all.<br>Soon, the two bladed weapons arrived before Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s vital spots. They were about to pierce into Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s body. As long as they pierced into his body, based on the strength of the two Supreme Elders, Chu Youyuan would undoubtedly be killed.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, an astonishing scene occurred. The two Supreme Elders&rsquo; weapons stopped right in front of Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s clothes. It was as if they were restricted, and unable to move an inch further.<br>&ldquo;This?&rdquo;<br>The two Supreme Elders looked to one another upon seeing this. Confusion filled their faces.<br>It was not only the two of them; even Chu Hanpeng and Chu Xuanzhengfa had confused expressions.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, a boundless aura was emitted from Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s body.<br>At that moment, the truth was revealed. Everyone realized why the two Supreme Elders, two rank two Exalted, were unable to injure Chu Youyuan.<br>The aura Chu Youyuan was emitting at that moment was that of a rank five Exalted. Even Chu Hanpeng was much inferior to him.<br>&ldquo;Rank five Exalted. This&hellip; this&hellip; this is impossible, impossible!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not Chu Youyuan. Who are you? Exactly who are you?!&rdquo;<br>The two Supreme Elders asked loudly. After sensing Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s aura, they had determined that the man before them was not Chu Youyuan, but instead was someone else.<br>The reason for that was because it would be impossible for Chu Youyuan to possess such a powerful cultivation.<br>&ldquo;You want to know who this old man is? Very well, since the truth is revealed, I might as well let you all see who I am.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Carefully look at me and see exactly who I am.&rdquo;<br>Chu Youyuan smiled coldly. Then, his face, whilst still smiling, began to transform.<br>Soon, Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s face changed completely. He turned into another old man.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, that is?!&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing the current Chu Youyuan, Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather, Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather, Chu Hanpeng, Chu Xuanzhengfa, the old lady, everyone else from the Chu Heavenly Clan, and all of the grand characters present all revealed astonished expressions.<br>This was especially true for Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather and Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather. The faces of those two Supreme Elders were currently covered in fear. It was as if they were seeing the Grim Reaper.<br>This was the first time that Chu Feng saw such fear on those two Supreme Elders&rsquo; faces.<br>&ldquo;Senior, it&rsquo;s you?&rdquo;<br>That said, when Chu Feng saw the current Chu Youyuan, his expression also changed.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had met that old man before.<br>Back when Chu Feng was heading for the Void Sacred Tree to find Wang Qiang, Chu Feng had encountered an old man that had journeyed alongside him.<br>After meeting that old man, Chu Feng inexplicably entered an illusory world. Inside that illusion, Chu Feng made a breakthrough in cultivation.<br>Back then, Chu Feng did not pay too much attention to the old man. He also did not feel that the appearance of that illusion was related to the old man.<br>However, Chu Feng now realized that that old man was not as simple as he had imagined him to be.<br>The reason for that was because the old man was emitting the aura of a rank five Exalted.<br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to Lord Clan Chief!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, everyone from the Chu Heavenly Clan shouted in unison.<br>Chu Feng looked around, and was astonished to discover that everyone from the Chu Heavenly Clan, including even Chu Hanpeng, had knelt on the ground and were respectfully greeting the old man standing before him.<br>&ldquo;What, he&rsquo;s the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng came to a sudden realization. He finally realized why Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather and Chu Zhiyuan&rsquo;s grandfather would become so panic-stricken, as if a great catastrophe was imminent after the old man revealed his true appearance.<br>Chu Feng also realized why Chu Youyuan was so overwhelmingly confident after arriving, why he was acting as if everything was within his grasp.<br>Last of all, Chu Feng realized why Chu Youyuan would declare that he would guarantee Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety, and definitely return justice to him before going there.<br>It turned out that he was simply not Chu Youyuan at all. Instead, he was the strongest individual of the Chu Heavenly Clan, the leader of the Chu Heavenly Clan, the ruler of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Lord Clan Chief!!!<br></p></div>
