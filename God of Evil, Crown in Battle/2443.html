        <div> - Three Great Secret Skills<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Then why did you kill that rank six Half Martial Ancestor and rank five Half Martial Ancestor?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;They unleashed killing intent toward me. If my cultivation was weaker than theirs, the one to die right now would have been me. To people who want to kill me, there&rsquo;s no reason for me to be lenient.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right, you always have your justifications,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said in a very helpless manner.<br>&ldquo;Brother, come here,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to Zhan Lingtong.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, I truly never expected for you&hellip; for you to be this powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are simply my idol.&rdquo;<br>Zhan Lingtong arrived before Chu Feng. The gaze with which he looked to Chu Feng had changed. Even the tone that he spoke with had changed. His tone when he spoke to Chu Feng was filled with admiration and adoration.<br>&ldquo;Enough of your flattering. Tell me&hellip; do you know where your beloved is at now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Zhan Lingtong.<br>&ldquo;I do, of course I do,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong nodded his head repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;Guide me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, you&rsquo;re&hellip; could it be that you&rsquo;re planning to help me save her?&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong revealed a joyous expression.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother with superfluous words. Bring me there,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he soared into the sky with Zhan Lingtong.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please, you must not disregard us,&rdquo; Seeing this, the humans started to howl in grief.<br>&ldquo;The monstrous beasts here are powerless to bring harm to you all. You all can stay here. I will return.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, his hands started to move about. Then, golden-bright and dazzling spirit power started to flow out of his body. In a flash, his spirit power covered the entire mine.<br>The spirit power formed two layers of spirit formations. The first layer was a concealment formation capable of concealing the actual circumstances inside the mine.<br>As for the second layer, it was a defensive formation capable of stopping others from intruding.<br>As Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation increased, his world spirit power also grew stronger. Thus, even though the dual layer of spirit formations was set up by Chu Feng effortlessly, they would still be very difficult to breach for all those with cultivations below rank nine Half Martial Ancestor.<br>&ldquo;Wow! Big brother, you&rsquo;re also a world spiritist? You are simply too amazing! I admire you more and more now!&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong saw everything and began to feel even greater admiration and adoration for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Enough of your flattering. C&rsquo;mon, lead the way,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That way,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong gave the directions.<br>Right after Zhan Lingtong said those words, both he and Chu Feng disappeared.<br>Guided by Zhan Lingtong, Chu Feng activated his Azure Dragon Dashing Technique and was rapidly journeying.<br>His speed was simply too fast. For someone of Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s cultivation, they were unable to even make out the scenery that they were rapidly passing below them.<br>Every time Zhan Lingtong gave Chu Feng directions, he would need Chu Feng to stop. Only by doing that would he be able to determine where they were.<br>That said, Zhan Lingtong was capable of clearly seeing the azure dragon beneath his feet.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, if I am not mistaken, this dragon of yours should be a secret skill, right?&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong asked.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, it is a secret skill. It would appear that you&rsquo;ve seen secret skills before?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile.<br>To be able to recognize a secret skill immediately generally meant that one had seen secret skills before. Else, they would only wonder if a technique was a secret skill, and not be able to be absolutely certain.<br>&ldquo;Of course. Our Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan has inherited three secret skills.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The first secret skill is called the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The second secret skill is called the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Spear.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The third secret skill is called the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Reportedly, these three secret skills were created by our ancestor. It is said that they are extremely powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, those three secret skills are different from your secret skill. It&rsquo;s very exhausting to unleash them. Generally, one will exhaust all of their physical strength upon using one. That said, it&rsquo;s true that they are extremely powerful,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? There are such secret skills?&rdquo;<br>Not only did Chu Feng possess the Four Symbols Secret Skills, he also possessed the Five Elements Secret Skills. However, all of them were extremely effortless for Chu Feng to unleash. He had never experienced an exhaustion of all his strength from using a secret skill.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, to tell you the truth, the other reason why the Clan Chief of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Monstrous Clan feared my grandfather was because my grandfather grasped one of our Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Three Great Secret Skills, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that this Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe was capable of deciding the outcome of a battle if both fighters possessed the same cultivation and battle power?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>Although the current Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan was not strong, it remained that they had given birth to an enormously powerful existence like Zhan Haichuan.<br>Furthermore, even now, Chu Feng did not have much understanding of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan. However, he felt that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan could not be looked down upon. At the very least, they should have been very powerful in the past.<br>Thus, Chu Feng was very curious about their secret skills; he was curious as to how powerful they were.<br>&ldquo;No, my grandfather possesses the same cultivation and battle power as my father,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, your grandfather&rsquo;s cultivation is a level weaker than the clan chief of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Monstrous Clan?&rdquo; Chu Feng was very surprised.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. However, my grandfather is currently in closed-door training. If he is able to successfully reach a breakthrough, we will no longer have to fear the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Monstrous Clan,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, that would mean that the secret skill, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe that your grandfather grasped, could allow him to battle against those with a cultivation one level above him?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s explain it like this. The Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe is extremely exhausting to use. Not only will it consume enormous martial power, it will even consume one&rsquo;s source energy, soul and life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as my grandfather is willing to do so, he can unleash the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Battle Axe with his own life on the line as the price. Upon unleashing the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Battle Axe, even the clan chief of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Monstrous Clan will not be able to withstand it,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined your Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s secret skills to be so powerful,&rdquo; Chu Feng was very shocked.<br>Although Chu Feng&rsquo;s secret skills were also very powerful, they clearly did not possess the sort of power that Zhan Lingtong described.<br>Although the prerequisite of sacrificing oneself to unleash the secret skill was an enormous cost, it remained that being able to prevail over an opponent a level of cultivation above oneself was very astonishing.<br>&ldquo;Stop gasping in admiration,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said, &ldquo;Who created your secret skills? It was Qing Xuantian. When he created the secret skills, his cultivation was not strong. Naturally, his secret skills will not be very strong either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, their secret skills are different. They were created by the ancestor of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan might be very weak now, I feel that their ancestor was most definitely an extraordinary individual. If their secret skills were created at their ancestor&rsquo;s peak, they would naturally not be something that your secret skills could compare with.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truth be told, the only reason why your secret skills are still able to unleash such great power is because you yourself possess extraordinary power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If ordinary people were to have your secret skills, they might be inferior to even Taboo Martial Skills now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, the power of a secret skill, apart from being related to its creator, is also greatly related to its possessor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Chu Feng agreed with what Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;With how powerful the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe is, could it be the strongest of the three secret skills?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Zhan Lingtong.<br>&ldquo;It is not. It is actually the weakest of the three,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually the weakest?&rdquo; At that moment, not to mention Chu Feng, even Her Lady Queen was surprised.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. The strongest of the Three Great Secret Skills is the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword. The second strongest is the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Spear. The Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Axe ranks third.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Spear was conquered by Lord Zhan Haichuan. As for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, no one has been able to conquer it so far,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br><br></p></div>
