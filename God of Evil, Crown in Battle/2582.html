        <h1>Chapter 2581</h1>
        <div> - Long Time No See<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Everyone knew that Chu Feng was the person who had saved Ying Mingchao and now possessed an extraordinary relationship with him.<br>However, they actually had no idea exactly what sort of status Chu Feng had in Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s heart.<br>However, after what happened at Hero City&rsquo;s entrance, the crowd realized Chu Feng&rsquo;s status in Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s heart.<br>To Ying Mingchao, Chu Feng was more important than his own reputation. It was as if he could fight against the whole world for Chu Feng&rsquo;s sake.<br>Furthermore, not long after that matter passed, Ying Mingchao did another thing that shocked everyone.<br>Ying Mingchao sent forth an invitation to both the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall. He had voluntarily offered to become allies with them.<br>Before that, it had always been the various powers going to Hero City to ask to become allies.<br>Even huge monsters like the Immortal Sword School and Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple sent forth representatives to Hero City to request to become allies.<br>In short, this was the first time that Hero City had voluntarily invited another power to become allies.<br>It was all thanks to Chu Feng that the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall were able to enjoy such treatment.<br>Back then, countless people had mocked and ridiculed the Sunset Cloud Valley and Three Stars Hall for declaring war against the Ying Heavenly Clan for the sake of helping Chu Feng.<br>Yet at that moment, there were countless people praising them for having such great insight.<br>At that moment the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall had arrived on schedule.<br>The people from the older generation were chatting amongst themselves, and the people from the younger generation were gathered together.<br>At that moment, not only was Liu Xiaoli in Chu Feng&rsquo;s personal palace, but Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu were also present.<br>In fact, even those members of the younger generation from the Three Stars Hall and Sunset Cloud Valley that Chu Feng was not very familiar with had received invitations.<br>Chu Feng knew that he would not be staying in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm for much longer, and would not have many chances to meet with those people.<br>As such, the current gathering could be said to be a rare opportunity. Thus, Chu Feng decided to take the opportunity to properly keep those people company.<br>Regardless of whether they were people that had gone through life and death together with him or people that he had only met once, it remained that they were all brought together by fate.<br>That was the reason why Chu Feng invited all of them over.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I said that you&rsquo;ll definitely become a greatly capable individual in the future. Look, I was right, no?&rdquo;<br>A sweet smile was present on Xu Yiyi&rsquo;s spotlessly white face. Although it had been several years since she had first met Chu Feng, Xu Yiyi&rsquo;s appearance remained completely unchanged. She was still pleasantly sweet-looking, and her character was still candid and open.<br>&ldquo;Yiyi, you&rsquo;re not the only one with good foresight. My foresight is pretty good too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back then, when my idol only just started growing famous, I already started declaring to everyone that Chu Feng was my idol. At that time, there were many people saying that I had problems with my vision.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, countless people now admire my vision,&rdquo; Song Biyu started to praise Chu Feng too.<br>Of course, she was also praising herself as she praised Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;If you all are to continue acting like this, my face will turn red,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Pah! I&rsquo;ve known you for so long, never have I seen your face turn red,&rdquo; Xu Yiyi said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen it either. Big sister Liu, have you?&rdquo; Song Biyu turned to ask Liu Xiaoli.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to recall seeing it either,&rdquo; Liu Xiaoli said with a faint smile.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng actually has the nerve to say that his face will turn red. Although his talent is exceptional, it seems that his skin is also extremely thick.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The next moment, the three girls started to laugh heartily. They were laughing so hard that their bodies started to rock back and forth.<br>It was unknown exactly what was so funny about this. However, they were laughing extremely hard.<br>Seeing this scene, those that were not familiar with Chu Feng started to feel admiration and envy from the bottoms of their hearts.<br>In the current Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, how many people would possibly dare to laugh at Chu Feng like this?<br>Likely, Xu Yiyi and the others would be the only ones that dared to do so.<br>As for Chu Feng, even though he was clearly being laughed at, he did not show the slightest bit of anger. Instead, he too, had a smile on his face.<br>With that, Chu Feng had revealed his closeness with the three girls. As such, how could the others possibly not feel envious of the three girls?<br>&ldquo;Truth be told, when I first met Chu Feng, although his talent was exceptional, his cultivation was truly not particularly high. While I knew that he would be able to accomplish great things at that time, I never expected him to become so powerful,&rdquo; Liu Xiaoli suddenly spoke with a serious expression.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; At that moment, Xu Yiyi and Song Biyu also looked to Chu Feng with thoughtful gazes.<br>As for those that had only met Chu Feng once before, they too started to ponder.<br>They all began to recall the time when they first met Chu Feng.<br>At that time, none of them had ever expected that the person before them would become the number one genius known to everyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm in merely a few short years. They never expected that he would become the number one expert beneath True Immortals.<br>At that moment, they once again started to gasp deeply with admiration.<br>As for Chu Feng, he was currently recalling some other people.<br>ZI Ling, Su Rou, Su Mei, Zhan Tianyi, Jiang Wushang...<br>Back then, he was still young. Spirited, he was about to leave the Nine Provinces Continent to journey to the Eastern Sea Region.<br>At that time, he had also gathered his friends from the Eastern Sea Region to talk about the future.<br>And now, in the blink of an eye, Chu Feng had not only left the Nine Provinces Continent, but he had also left the Eastern Sea Region, the Holy Land of Martialism and the entire Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.<br>He had arrived at the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm by himself. He had separated from his lovers and brothers. He now lived in completely different worlds to them. Between them was the vast starry sky.<br>The distance between them was extremely far, so far that Chu Feng would not be able to see them regardless of how much he missed them.<br>&lsquo;Are you all doing fine still?&rsquo; As he pondered, emotions filled Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart.<br>In the blink of an eye, several years had passed. Yet, Chu Feng had not been able to find Su Rou and Su Mei. He had no idea as to whether they were still alive or not.<br>Furthermore, he had no idea how Zhan Tianyi and Jiang Wushang were doing in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.<br>He had no idea about the future at all...<br>Filled with emotions, Chu Feng started to cherish the friends before him even more. At that moment, Chu Feng spread forth his spirit power. His spirit power covered all of Hero City, and even reached outside Hero City.<br>He wanted to see if there were any more familiar faces present among the people there.<br>&ldquo;This aura, it&rsquo;s her?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed.<br>Xu Yiyi and the others all heard Chu Feng&rsquo;s muttering. As such, they asked, &ldquo;Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone, please excuse me. I will have you all wait here for a bit.&rdquo; After Chu Feng finished saying those words, his body shifted, and he disappeared.<br>When he appeared again, he had arrived outside of Hero City.<br>&ldquo;Look! It&rsquo;s Lord Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>The crowd immediately burst into an uproar when they saw Chu Feng.<br>Someone as famous as Chu Feng had already become the idol of countless people in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. As long as someone recognized him, regardless of where he might go, Chu Feng would definitely cause a major commotion. This was even more so when they were outside Hero City.<br>At that moment, the people that saw Chu Feng all began to rush toward him. From the sky and on the ground, a vast crowd was gathering around Chu Feng. They were pushing and shouting at one another. Some even started fighting among themselves because of it.<br>However, there were two figures that were currently withdrawing.<br>They were two women, two very ordinary-looking women.<br>However, they were precisely the ones that had caught Chu Feng&rsquo;s attention and brought him here.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body shifted. He passed through the crowd and arrived before the two women, stopping their path.<br>The two women were immediately startled upon seeing Chu Feng. Incomparably complicated emotions emerged in their eyes.<br>As for Chu Feng, the corners of his mouth were raised into a smile. He said, &ldquo;Tang Ying, long time no see.&rdquo;<br><br></p></div>
