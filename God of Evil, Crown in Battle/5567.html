        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Chu Feng was confident, thinking that he would surely be able to benefit from this formation with his intelligence. Even if he couldn&rsquo;t further raise his spirit power, just gaining a deeper grasp of this formation was a good thing too.</span><br><span>To his astonishment, there was a protective mechanism applied to this formation. It deprived him of any chance to siphon away its energy or tap into its secrets.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It looks like it won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</span><br><span>By this point, Chu Feng was certain that he couldn&rsquo;t get anything out of the formation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Eggy asked in confusion.</span><br><span>Chu Feng told her the reason.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Damn it! Who&rsquo;s the scaredy cat who constructed a formation but was afraid that others might look into it? To even put in place such defensive measures&hellip; how despicable!&rdquo; Eggy cursed.</span><br><span>Chu Feng burst into laughter.</span><br><span>There was nothing wrong with a world spiritist protecting their formation, but Eggy still berated the other party anyway. Her sense of principles deviated from the norms, in the sense that she prioritized Chu Feng above all things else. She definitely wouldn&rsquo;t count as a good person in the eyes of most people, but how could Chu Feng not be fond of her?</span><br><span>In a fit of anger, Eggy said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Chu Feng. It&rsquo;s not as if we really have to see his formation anyway. What we comprehend from the formation here can only be used here anyway.&rdquo;</span><br><span>She was consoling Chu Feng out of worry that he would feel dismayed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I do find this matter regretful, but this is far from enough to faze me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>He didn&rsquo;t feel discouraged by this matter as he knew that the problem didn&rsquo;t lay in his own incompetence. The world spiritist who constructed this formation was many ranks stronger than him. There was nothing he could do about it if the other party didn&rsquo;t want him to peek into it.</span><br><span>&hellip;</span><br><span>Hours later, Little Fishy finally walked out from the city formation.</span><br><span>Her body emanated a starlight formation glow that made her seem like a celestial being, though what was more important was that her formation armor was much stronger than before. In terms of sheer formation armor, Little Fishy was definitely at an advantage compared to Jie Tian.</span><br><span>Upon closer examination, however, Chu Feng noticed something was amiss.</span><br><span>The power didn&rsquo;t come from Little </span><span>Fishy&rsquo;s</span><span> formation armor but from the starlight formation itself. In other words, she would remain this strong even if she lost her formation armor, as long as the starlight formation continued to function.</span><br><span>However, the starlight formation was bound to be temporary. It was only a matter of time before it dissipated.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother!!!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Little Fishy rushed over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side. She trusted him so much that she didn&rsquo;t bother concealing the power of the starlight formation, instead fully revealing its prowess to him.</span><br><span>Due to that, Chu Feng could tell that the starlight formation did more than just enhance her fighting prowess. It harnessed many other means such as formation deciphering, concealment, protection, and so on.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you able to utilize all of those formation powers?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, I can,&rdquo; Little Fishy replied with a nod before demonstrating it to him.</span><br><span>She was indeed able to use the formation powers.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng was assured to see how easily Little Fishy could tap into the starlight formation&rsquo;s power. There was no need for her to fear Jie Tian anymore in her current state.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother, I know how we can enter the palace doors now. Let&rsquo;s head there,&rdquo; Little Fishy said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>Considering that even the formation here was already this formidable, he was dying with curiosity to know what kind of secret was hidden inside the palace. Before making a move, he turned to Little Fishy and said, &ldquo;Use the concealment formation to hide first.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother, am I still not a match for Jie Tian in my current state?&rdquo; Little Fishy blinked her eyes and asked, knowing that the only one who could threaten her in her current state was Jie Tian.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Your strength is above Jie Tian&rsquo;s, based on what I can see. However, it&rsquo;d still be easier for us to maneuver in the dark. Your concealment formation looks to be strong enough to elude Jie Tian&rsquo;s notice, and it&rsquo;d be a waste not to use it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hiding in the shadows? That sounds like a good idea to me. All right, I&rsquo;ll listen to big brother.&rdquo; Little Fishy nodded in admiration.</span><br><span>She was completely obedient before Chu Feng, not putting up any airs as the princess of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan at all. Even </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> would have found it inconceivable that she could behave in such a manner, especially since he had never seen such a side to her.</span><br><span>After making up their minds, the two of them made their way toward the palace.</span><br><span>Jie Tian was already there by the time they arrived. His formation armor was emanating black gaseous flames tinged with the aura of the evil power. He was much stronger compared to how Chu Feng last remembered him before making his escape.</span><br><span>He was in no way weaker than Little Fishy at all.</span><br><span>With his newfound strength, he constructed an overwhelmingly powerful black formation that pierced through the sky. He was using this formation to open the doors.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gotten stronger,&rdquo; Chu Feng said grimly.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; Little Fishy asked.</span><br><span>Jie Tian was much stronger than she expected. It would be difficult for her to deal with Jie Tian in his current state.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Wait a moment. He&rsquo;ll expend a fair bit of power channeling that formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Little Fishy knew that Chu Feng wanted to wait for Jie Tian to expend as much power as possible before making a move.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother, he&rsquo;s opening the palace doors using a different method from what I have grasped, but the door seems to be reacting. Is his method effective too?&rdquo; Little Fishy was confused.</span><br><span>The method she had learned from the city formation should have been the only method to open the palace door, but somehow, the palace doors were shaking violently under the stimulation of Jie Tian&rsquo;s formation.</span><br><span>It looked like he would be able to open the doors given sufficient time.</span><br><span>&ldquo;His method is unorthodox, but it&rsquo;s effective,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Was I off the mark? Did he receive a clue from the trial too?&rdquo; Little Fishy frowned.</span><br><span>She had received some benefits from clearing the Immemorial Star Sea&rsquo;s trial, namely the right to enter the Star Memorial Domain and information about the locations of the city formation and the palace. It was just that she feigned ignorance in order to test Jie Tian&rsquo;s character.</span><br><span>Through her interactions with Jie Tian, she began suspecting that he had defected to the evil power. The last time they entered the Star Memorial Domain, she finally confirmed it.</span><br><span>She was intending to inform the primal elder of the matter so that the latter could judge Jie Tian, but she changed her mind after seeing how much the primal elder favored him. She figured that the primal elder might not necessarily believe her since she didn&rsquo;t have concrete evidence.</span><br><span>It would be wiser for her to personally deal with Jie Tian.</span><br><span>She had thought all this while that Jie Tian didn&rsquo;t know the secrets of this land, but it would appear that she had been thinking too simply of him. It could be possible that he had received some benefits from clearing the trial too, just that what he had received was different from hers.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He is using unorthodox means. I reckon it was from the evil power,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Evil power? Big brother, are you saying he can communicate with the evil power?&rdquo; Little Fishy asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;My guess is that not only can he communicate with the evil power, but he has also won its trust and support. Otherwise, the other defectors wouldn&rsquo;t have treated him with such deference.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng turned to Little Fishy and continued with a severe expression, &ldquo;Little Fishy, while you are enhanced by the core formation of this realm, Jie Tian is backed by evil power. That evil power is unfathomably powerful. You can&rsquo;t let your guard down dealing with him.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo; Little Fishy nodded obediently. She looked at Jie Tian, but there was no fear in her eyes despite knowing that he was a fearsome adversary. A smile formed on her lips as she said, &ldquo;Things are getting interesting.&rdquo;</span><br></p></div>
