        <h1>Chapter 1968</h1>
        <div> - Rank Two Martial Emperor<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>The Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader was extremely famous. It was a weapon used by the Beast Emperor, the Black Dragon King, a weapon that had killed countless experts.<br>Furthermore, according to legend, the Beast Emperor, the Black Dragon King, had used that Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader to slice apart another expert&rsquo;s Imperial Armament. Furthermore, it just so happened that that expert had been someone from the Heavenly Law Palace.<br>Thus, as an elder of the Heavenly Law Palace, although Zhao Yu had never seen the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader before, he knew its appearance by heart.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. This is the Beast Emperor&rsquo;s, the Black Dragon King&rsquo;s Imperial Armament, Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;Ever since the Beast Emperor disappeared from the world, the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader had also disappeared. As of now, it has been several tens of thousands of years. So it was actually hidden here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly what sort of place is this? Could it be&hellip; could it be that this is the Beast Emperor, the Black Dragon King&rsquo;s place of burial?&rdquo; Zhao Yu asked.<br>&ldquo;Your guess is only half correct. Although senior Black Dragon King&rsquo;s treasures that he obtained throughout his life are all hidden here, he is not buried here.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he grabbed that Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader and instilled his own aura into it.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a violent wind began to surge and many lightning strikes filled this relatively small space.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>In fact, many ear-piercing dragon roars could also be heard. At this moment, the seriously injured Zhao Yu was actually unable to withstand their might, and was blown away. He began to crawl on the ground, and was struck by many lightning bolts that left many wounds on his body and caused him to vomit mouthfuls of blood. His appearance was truly miserable.<br>Feeling helpless, Zhao Yu shouted, &ldquo;Stop, stop, quickly, stop. I&rsquo;ll die if this is to continue,&rdquo;<br>However, Chu Feng completely ignored him. It was not that Chu Feng did not hear his shouting. Rather, Chu Feng was busy conquering the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader, and did not have any time to be concerned about that old bastard&rsquo;s fate.<br>Finally, the surroundings calmed down. When Zhao Yu, who was ravaged by the scene, opened his weak eyes and looked to Chu Feng again, he was immediately shocked. Envy and jealousy filled his eyes.<br>Success. Chu Feng had successfully subdued the legendary Imperial Armament, the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader.<br>&ldquo;Absolute Submission. You actually managed to make such an Imperial Armament enter Absolute Submission?!&rdquo; At this time when Zhao Yu was filled with envy and jealousy toward Chu Feng, he was also revealing an expression of disbelief all across his face.<br>It was already a very remarkable task should one be able to subdue an Imperial Armament. As for making an Imperial Armament enter Absolute Submission, that was something that was practically never accomplished. However, Chu Feng had accomplished this feat.<br>However, upon thinking about it, it was also reasonable for such a thing to happen. After all, Chu Feng was someone that possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation. With merely that, Chu Feng was already someone that surpassed all ordinary people. Even if an Imperial Armament entered Absolute Submission toward him, it would not be too strange.<br>However, even with that being the case, Zhao Yu still felt as if there were seas and rivers overturning in his heart. He was unable to calm himself in the slightest. The reason for that was because that Imperial Armament was not any ordinary Imperial Armament, but the legendary Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, it has entered Absolute Submission. This Furious  Coiling Dragon Beheader&rsquo;s power is very strong. Unfortunately, it is still insufficient for me to reach a breakthrough,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with his lips curled.<br>&ldquo;Not reach a breakthrough? How could that be? The domineering might of the scene earlier was definitely that of Absolute Submission. How did you not reach a breakthrough?&rdquo; Zhao Yu possessed a face of confusion.<br>When an Imperial Armament entered Absolute Submission, it would share a portion of its strength with its master. As for that portion, it was generally sufficient to allow one to reach a breakthrough.<br>As Chu Feng was only a rank one Martial Emperor; even if he didn&rsquo;t break through to rank three Martial Emperor directly, the power from that Imperial Armament should have been more than enough to allow him to break through to rank two Martial Emperor. As such, why was he still a rank one Martial Emperor? This was truly unreasonable.<br>As for Chu Feng, he ignored Zhao Yu and turned his gaze to the cultivation resources and Natural Oddities that filled the ground.<br>Even though the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader had not managed to help him reach a breakthrough, Chu Feng felt that he would definitely be able to reach a breakthrough after refining all of the cultivation resources and Natural Oddities in this place.<br>Thus, Chu Feng sat down in a cross-legged manner and opened his mouth wide. Right in front of Elder Zhao Yu, he began to refine the cultivation resources in this place.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! This guy?!!!&rdquo;<br>As Elder Zhao Yu saw Chu Feng eating those cultivation resources with an appearance akin to eating rice and with enormous speed, his aged expression began to change. He was stunned, because what Chu Feng was doing was practically impossible for ordinary people.<br>&ldquo;You, you&hellip; you, exactly what are you? Are you a monster?!!!!&rdquo;<br>Then, when he saw that Chu Feng was beginning to refine the Natural Oddities in this place in the same manner, he was completely stunned, and overwhelmed with fear.<br>Natural Oddities were items that possessed very berserk energies. They were simply impossible to refine. If one were to forcibly refine them, one would end up dying.<br>Yet, Chu Feng was refining them in the same manner as he had refined the ordinary cultivation resources. He was not affected by their berserk energies in the slightest. This was truly something that Elder Zhao Yu was unable to accept.<br>At the moment before Chu Feng managed to completely refine all of the Natural Oddities, his aura suddenly started to rise sharply. He had reached a breakthrough. Finally, Chu Feng had reached a breakthrough from rank one Martial Emperor, and became a rank two Martial Emperor.<br>&ldquo;Breakthrough? Even after refining all that stuff, he only just reached a breakthrough?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That guy, he refined all those Natural Oddities. Yet, not only did he not die, he even reached a breakthrough?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He really refined those Natural Oddities and absorbed their Natural Energy,&rdquo; At this moment, Elder Zhao Yu was overwhelmed with shock.<br>As for Chu Feng, he did not care about what Elder Zhao Yu was feeling at all. Instead, with a spurt of energy, Chu Feng completely refined all of the Natural Oddities in this place.<br>Even though those Natural Oddities were unable to help Chu Feng reach a breakthrough, they provided a very good foundation for his next breakthrough.<br>The treasures left behind by the Beast Emperor had truly helped Chu Feng enormously.<br>&ldquo;Senior Beast Emperor is truly good to me. Eggy, you&rsquo;ve also seen it right? We have obtained an enormous harvest this time around,&rdquo; With a smile on his face, Chu Feng spoke to Eggy.<br>Chu Feng knew that even though Eggy was unable to speak or respond to him, she was actually awake. He knew that she had seen all the things he had experienced thus far.<br>Afterward, Chu Feng stood up and began to collect the treasures in this place without any restraint.<br>There were truly a lot of treasures here. Even though there was only a single Imperial Armament, and all of the things that could be refined had already been refined, the things that remained were still mostly treasures.<br>Furthermore, like Zhao Yu had said, many of the treasures here were extinct in the Holy Land of Martialism. They were priceless. Any one of these treasures would be able to cause a bloody scramble.<br>&ldquo;How was it? Jealous? Hehe&hellip;&rdquo; As Chu Feng was collecting the treasures, he deliberately tried to enrage Zhao Yu.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, as the saying goes, when one finds things together, one should share half. I do not wish for half, but you should be able to spare me a bit, no?&rdquo; This Zhao Yu was actually also a shameless fellow. He actually made this sort of request of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Hehe, what do you think I&rsquo;ll do?&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed mischievously. Then, he continued to collect the treasures in this place. It was only after he had collected all of the treasures here that he turned to Zhao Yu with a smile on his face. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost done collecting all of the treasures here. After that, I&rsquo;ll be able to bring you away.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you already collected all of the treasures here?&rdquo; Zhao Yu looked to the empty space before him and frowned. The only thing that Chu Feng had not collected was the air in this place. Other than that, not even a speck of hair remained. As such, what did he mean by &lsquo;almost done?&rsquo; What else could he collect?<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong, there&rsquo;s still more,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he extended his hand and made a grabbing motion. Zhao Yu&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm.<br>Zhao Yu&rsquo;s expression changed. Angrily, he shouted, &ldquo;Chu Feng, that is mine! You are robbing me here!!!&rdquo; This Zhao Yu was a famous miser. He was someone that had never given any of his treasures to others. Yet, at this moment, that Cosmos Sack that contained all the treasures he had gathered throughout his life was snatched away by Chu Feng. As such, how could he possibly tolerate that?<br><br></p></div>
