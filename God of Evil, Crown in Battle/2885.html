        <div> - The Actual Contest<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Seeing this, the crowd arrived before the second Inheritance Site.<br>The wheel in the center of the second Inheritance Site was already revolving.<br>It was filled with runes and symbols, and looked very picturesque as it flickered with light.<br>That said, the method to unlock the second Inheritance Site was not something that everyone could determine.<br>In fact, not only did the disciples from the Starfall Holy Land and NIne Profound Sect fail to determine the method to unlock the second Inheritance Site, but even Chu Feng and the Liangqiu sisters were unable to determine it.<br>It would appear that they would truly have to properly examine the second Inheritance Site in order to figure out how to decipher it.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin,&rdquo; Liangqiu Hongyue said to Chu Feng.<br>After she said those words, she and her sister began to stare at the revolving wheel. They were searching for the method to decipher and unlock the second Inheritance Site.<br>At that moment, the eyes of the Liangqiu sisters changed. The two of them were actually faintly emitting golden light from their eyes.<br>If one were able to see their eyes head-on, one would notice that there were runes and symbols circulating through their eyes. It was as if an entire world was contained within their eyes.<br>Those were spirit formations, a sort of very powerful spirit formation.<br>Even though Chu Feng did not inspect their eyes head-on, Chu Feng was able to sense the change that had occurred to them.<br>He was able to tell that the Liangqiu sisters must be using their special observation method. Furthermore, their observation method was no small matter.<br>Under such circumstances, Chu Feng did not dare underestimate his opponents. Thus, at practically the same moment when the Liangqiu sisters began observing the second Inheritance Site, Chu Feng also activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>That said, as Chu Feng&rsquo;s mastery over his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes had increased, he was able to keep them very well hidden even after activating them. Others would not be able to notice any change to him.<br>Thus, by comparison, the Liangqiu sisters&rsquo; eyes were very eye-catching as their abilities were revealed.<br>Chu Feng, on the other hand, appeared unglamorous. It was as if he had done nothing at all.<br>Because of this, the surrounding crowd was very confused.<br>As for the surrounding crowd, they were naturally the disciples from the Starfall Holy Land and the Nine Profound Sect.<br>They knew very well that their world spirit techniques were much inferior to those of Chu Feng and the Liangqiu sisters.<br>Thus, they simply had no thoughts about attempting to decipher the second Inheritance Site. Instead, they placed all of their hopes on Chu Feng or the Liangqiu sisters.<br>Even Xia Yun&rsquo;er was no exception.<br>At that moment, they had truly become spectators. They were observing the show with an outsider&rsquo;s attitude.<br>&lsquo;Damn it! They actually cast this gentleman aside!&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;I will have you all know how powerful I am!&rsquo;<br>Seeing the crowd gathered around Chu Feng and the Liangqiu sisters and completely ignoring him, Asura Zhao Kun felt extremely displeased. He swore in his heart that he would definitely prove himself.<br>Thus, Asura Zhao Kun also started to use his observation abilities to examine the second Inheritance Site&rsquo;s spinning wheel. He wanted to find the method to decipher it.<br>His observation method was actually even more exceptional than that of the Liangqiu sisters.<br>At the very least, it appeared much more impressive than theirs.<br>His entire body was emitting golden light. Dazzling runes and symbols covered his entire body. However, the runes and symbols were very orderly. Like river water entering a great ocean, they were gathering toward his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Brother Zhao&rsquo;s observation technique is truly amazing!!!&rdquo;<br>Once Asura Zhao Kun unleashed his observation technique, he immediately caught the attention of the younger generations present.<br>It was only at that moment that they recalled that Chu Feng and the Liangqiu sisters were not the only expert world spiritists here.<br>Asura Zhao Kun was also an expert world spiritist.<br>Being focused on by the crowd again, Asura Zhao Kun became immensely pleased.<br>He began to wholeheartedly concentrate on observing that spinning wheel. He wanted to decipher how to unlock it.<br>&ldquo;Big sister.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little sister.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Liangqiu Hongyue and Liangqiu Lanyue both retrieved their gazes from the second Inheritance Site and looked to one another.<br>As their gazes met, the two sisters started setting up a spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;This fast?!&rdquo;<br>Seeing this, the expressions of Xia Yun&rsquo;er and the others all changed. They were greatly surprised.<br>After all, no matter how lacking in talent they might be, they were all still Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists. Thus, they were able to tell with a single glance that the Liangqiu sisters were setting up an unsealing formation.<br>However, it had only been a short while since they had started observing the spinning wheel. As such, how could they possibly be able to decipher the method to unlock the second Inheritance Site so quickly?<br>&lsquo;Impossible! How could they determine the method to unlock the second Inheritance Site in such a short period of time?!&rsquo;<br>Asura Zhao Kun also noticed the actions of the Liangqiu sisters, and cried out in rejection in his heart.<br>However, not long after them, Chu Feng also started setting up his spirit formation.<br>&lsquo;He also managed to decipher it?! Impossible! This is definitely impossible!&rsquo;<br>Asura Zhao Kun cried out in denial in his heart repeatedly. The reason for that was because the puzzle of that spinning wheel was truly profound.<br>He had only managed to decipher a tenth of it. Chu Feng and the Liangqiu sisters had only started a short bit sooner than him. Thus, how could they possibly have been able to decipher the entire spinning wheel so quickly?<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the Liangqiu sisters finished setting up their spirit formation.<br>Furthermore, guided by the Liangqiu sisters, their spirit formation shot forth a ray of light toward the center of the spinning wheel.<br>The next moment, the spirit formation and that spinning wheel started to combine.<br>A great amount of symbols and runes were surging out of the spirit formation like a tide. Following the ray of light, they were being sent into the spinning wheel.<br>Soon, the speed of the spinning wheel started accelerating. After that, a &lsquo;snap&rsquo; was heard, and the tightly-closed gate opened.<br>&ldquo;This, this, this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, Asura Zhao Kun&rsquo;s jaw dropped.<br>He had been insistent that the Liangqiu sisters couldn&rsquo;t possibly be that quick to decipher the puzzle within the spinning wheel.<br>However, the Inheritance Site had clearly been opened. This meant that he had guessed wrong.<br>The Liangqiu sisters actually really managed to see through the puzzle in the spinning wheel in such a short period of time. Furthermore, they&rsquo;d managed to successfully set up a corresponding unsealing formation to successfully unlock the second Inheritance Site.<br>&ldquo;They actually managed to successfully unlock the second Inheritance Site, and in one attempt on top of that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Amazing! Truly amazing! Is this the ability of Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s disciples?!&rdquo;<br>When even Asura Zhao Kun was feeling disbelief, the others present would naturally be feeling even greater disbelief.<br>Even Xia Yun&rsquo;er revealed a complicated expression in her eyes as she looked to the Liangqiu sisters.<br>Whilst the expression in her eyes could not be considered jealousy, it most definitely contained envy and admiration.<br>That was normal. After all, they were all members of the younger generation, and all women on top of that. How could she not feel envy and admiration for the Liangqiu sisters when they possessed such powerful world spirit techniques?<br>That said, to Xia Yun&rsquo;er, she was perhaps envious not of the Liangqiu sisters themselves. Instead, her envy might be at how the Liangqiu sisters were able to have such a powerful master.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it would appear that we sisters have won the first round,&rdquo; Liangqiu Hongyue said to Chu Feng.<br>Even though she said those words with a smile on her face, her words were filled with provocation.<br>Chu Feng was not angered. Instead, he smiled at Liangqiu Hongyue. Furthermore, he clasped his fist and said, &ldquo;Congratulations.&rdquo;<br>Faced with such a courteous reaction from Chu Feng, Liangqiu Hongyue, who was originally planning to insult Chu Feng, was at loss for words.<br>&ldquo;Little sister, look at Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice transmission entered Liangqiu Hongyue&rsquo;s ears. It was Liangqiu Lanyue.<br>Hearing her older sister&rsquo;s voice, Liangqiu Hongyue also turned her eyes toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation.<br>Once she saw Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation, the joyous smile underneath her mask immediately froze.<br>It was only at that moment that she discovered that Chu Feng had also finished setting up his spirit formation. Furthermore&hellip; his spirit formation was also the correct one.<br>This meant that even though the two of them had managed to win against Chu Feng this round, it was a narrow victory.<br>Furthermore, they had only finished setting up their spirit formation a little bit faster than Chu Feng.<br><br><br></p></div>
