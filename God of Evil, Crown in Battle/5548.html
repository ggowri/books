        <h1>Chapter 5548: Worth Grooming</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>A conflict had broken out between Little Fishy and Jie Tian. Little Fishy fell in defeat and even sustained injuries.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you certain about the news is reliable?&rdquo; Chu Feng walked up to the man with white brows and asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with you, 521? Why are you eavesdropping on our conversation instead of focusing on your pill forging? No wonder you take so long to forge a pill! It turns out that you haven&rsquo;t been concentrating at work at all!&rdquo; the man with white brows berated Chu Feng.</span><br><span>His attitude toward Chu Feng had taken a 180-degree shift in just the short span of a few days.</span><br><span>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t too bothered by the change in attitude. He smiled at them and said, &ldquo;I heard that Lord Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er is currently fighting for us, so I&rsquo;m more concerned about her.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Those words only provoked a sneer from the man with white brows, as he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just Lord Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er who is fighting for us but Lord Jie Tian too. Why aren&rsquo;t you concerned about him too? I think that you&rsquo;re just lusting for Lord Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s beauty.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd burst into laughter upon hearing those words.</span><br><span>The man with white brows looked at Chu Feng with disdainful eyes as he sneered, &ldquo;521, look at yourself. You&rsquo;re a mere intermediate formation master. How dare the likes of you desire Lord Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er? A toad lusting over a swan&rsquo;s flesh! If not for the high elder&rsquo;s recommendation, you wouldn&rsquo;t have even become an intermediate formation master!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd&rsquo;s laughter became even louder.</span><br><span>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t lose his temper. He simply shrugged with a smile before returning to his workstation. His lack of response made him look like a coward in others&rsquo; eyes.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That useless thing! We would have long driven him out if it wasn&rsquo;t for the high elder. It&rsquo;s hilarious how he even had the galls to accept your gift!&rdquo; some of the formation masters walked over to the man with white brows&rsquo; side and spoke aloud.</span><br><span>Upon hearing those words, Chu Feng returned their gifts with a wave of his sleeves and said, &ldquo;Take back your gifts since you aren&rsquo;t sincere about them,&rdquo;</span><br><span>Those formation masters took back their gifts without any hesitation. Even so, their attitude toward Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t improve in the least.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Those fellows are eyesores. Who could have thought that formation entities would be this political? I&rsquo;d have massacred them if I could get out of here,&rdquo; Eggy grumbled in displeasure.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s bound to be politics where there&rsquo;s desire. I knew from the moment they showered me with undeserved goodwill when I first arrived that they would turn against me if my performance prove to be unsatisfactory. Still, I didn&rsquo;t think that they would turn on me that quickly. How dumb. They don&rsquo;t have any depth at all. They should have patiently waited for a while longer before showing their true colors. However, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to me since I&rsquo;m just making use of them,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>He wasn&rsquo;t angry in the least.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you think that their information on Little Fishy is accurate? Is Jie Tian so strong as to be able to defeat Little Fishy?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>She hadn&rsquo;t seen the matured Little Fishy yet, but she vividly remembered the astonishing talent she displayed as a child.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll head to the Star Sea Central City tonight to take a look,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>That night, Chu Feng made his way to the Star Sea Central City. He encountered the barrier that blocked his path the last time, to which, he constructed his own formation in an attempt to breach it.</span><br><span>However, just as he had expected, it was extremely difficult for him to breach the barrier despite having raised his spirit power to White Dragon God-cloak. He spent six hours on the barrier but only succeeded in generating a small crack on it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It looks like my spirit power is still too weak.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng could tell from the result that his spirit power wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to breach the barrier yet. As much as he wanted to meet Little Fishy to understand her current situation, there was nothing he could do since he was still too weak.</span><br><span>Left with no choice, he could only head back.</span><br><span>On the way back, he spotted an old man struggling on the ground with a pained look. He appeared to be a high formation master, though he didn&rsquo;t seem to be from the city Chu Feng was currently residing in.</span><br><span>Chu Feng had no idea what the old man was doing here, but he could tell that the latter was in a dire state. Even though they weren&rsquo;t acquainted and the latter was only a formation entity, he chose to intervene.</span><br><span>He first concealed his appearance before landing on the ground.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Did you sustain these injuries from the formation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the old man.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The old man strenuously nodded his head.</span><br><span>Chu Feng quickly constructed a recovery formation to treat the old man&rsquo;s injuries.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What incredible means! Why do you conceal your name?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The old man felt grateful to Chu Feng, especially when he sensed how effective the formation was. However, he couldn&rsquo;t understand why Chu Feng was concealing his appearance and the identification number embroidered on his robe.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, I don&rsquo;t want others to know who I am. You should be able to recover within four hours inside this recovery formation. You don&rsquo;t have to repay me for this favor. Just treat it as if we have never met,&rdquo; Chu Feng said before flitting off into the night.</span><br><span>As soon as Chu Feng left, the old man lying on the ground suddenly rose to his feet. His </span><span>pained expression vanished as if it was just an illusion, and his injuries instantaneously recovered.</span><br><span>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!</span><br><span>Several figures dressed in silver armor swooped down and stood behind the old man. Their silver armor was so exquisite that there was not a person in Chu Feng&rsquo;s city who possessed it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chief elder, that man attempted to sneak into the Star Sea Central City. Should we really let him off just like that?&rdquo; one of the guards asked.</span><br><span>It turned out that the elder was one of the powerful chief elders of the Star Sea Realm.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Do you know why I feigned injury instead of arresting him right away?&rdquo; the chief elder asked.</span><br><span>The crowd shook their heads. They had been patrolling together with the chief elder when they spotted the hidden Chu Feng attempting to breach the Star Sea Central City&rsquo;s barrier.</span><br><span>Under normal circumstances, they should have arrested Chu Feng right away. Yet, to their bewilderment, the chief elder chose to put on a show instead.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Look at this recovery formation. Do you think this is something that can be constructed by a normal White Dragon God-cloak?&rdquo; the chief elder pointed to the recovery formation Chu Feng had constructed as he asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;His control over his spirit power is indeed amazing.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd acknowledged Chu Feng&rsquo;s skills despite the enmity they felt toward him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just this recovery formation. The formation he used to breach the barrier earlier is amazing as well. While our city barrier isn&rsquo;t particularly resilient, it is strong enough to keep most Blue Dragon God-cloaks at bay. However, I reckon that lad will be able to easily deal with this barrier once his spirit power advances to Gray Dragon God-cloak. It&rsquo;s out of admiration for his talent that I chose not to capture him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;As for why I feigned injury earlier, my goal was to test his character. If he turned a blind eye to me, I would have had him arrested right away. However, he chose to lend a helping hand instead. This shows that he has potential&hellip; He is worth grooming,&rdquo; the chief elder said.</span><br></p></div>
