        <h1>Chapter 3802</h1>
        <div> - One&rsquo;s Beloved<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng returned to Autumnfall Village. Originally, he had planned to proceed directly toward Song Ge&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s residence.<br>However, right after Chu Feng entered Autumnfall Village, he heard miserable weeping cries from Song Ge and Old Freak Tang.<br>Furthermore, the weeping sounds did not come from Song Ge&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s residence. Instead, they came from Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s smithy.<br>Chu Feng looked over and, upon close inspection, realized why Song Ge and Old Freak Tang were grieving so much.<br>At that moment, Song Ge&rsquo;s mother was peacefully lying on Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s bed.<br>She had passed. It seemed like she must&rsquo;ve just passed.<br>Unfortunately, it seemed like Song Ge and Old Freak Tang had missed out on Song Ge&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s last moments.<br>That was why the two of them were grieving.<br>Song Ge&rsquo;s sadness came purely from her reluctance to part with her mother.<br>As for Old Freak Tang, his sadness came from his guilt and self-blame.<br>The reason for that was because Song Ge&rsquo;s mother was not only very well-dressed, but she was also holding a pillow in her bosom.<br>Chu Feng recognize that pillow. It was Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s pillow, the pillow that he used every day.<br>Song Ge&rsquo;s mother knew that she was dying, and decided not to die in her own home. Instead, she travelled to Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s residence.<br>In the end, she had revealed that...<br>Even though she had detested Old Freak Tang for how heartless he was, she had still deeply loved him the entire time.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng finally understood why Song Ge&rsquo;s mother would decide to endure all the rumors, slander, bullying and humiliation from the villagers after giving birth to Song Ge, yet refused to leave Autumnfall Village.<br>It turned out that what she was reluctant to part with was actually not Autumnfall Village. Instead, she was reluctant to part with Old Freak Tang.<br>Naturally, Old Freak Tang also realized that.<br>That was the reason why he felt so ashamed and guilty, and was blaming himself.<br>He had let down a woman that deeply loved him.<br>Chu Feng did not disturb Old Freak Tang and Song Ge. He also stopped using his special technique to observe them.<br>The father and daughter had finally reunited after so many years. Chu Feng did not wish to disturb them. He wanted to give them some time alone.<br>After all, Old Freak Tang did not have much time left himself...<br>That said, Chu Feng did not go far away. He stayed outside the smithy.<br>Chu Feng sat on the lawn and looked at the gradually setting sun. His heart felt very heavy and achingly painful.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s mood was also not very good. He felt that Old Freak Tang was actually a rather ill-fated person too.<br>When he finally discovered that his woman actually still loved him, his woman had already passed.<br>When he had finally managed to reunite with his daughter, he did not have much time left.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng started to long for certain people.<br>He longed for his father, his mother, his grandfather and grandmother.<br>He also longed for Zi Ling, Su Rou and Su Mei. In fact, he also longed to see Eggy, who had been dormant, and had not spoken with him for a very long time.<br>He also longed for his brothers that had fought bravely alongside him.<br>Life was both long and short. It was possible for every meeting to be the last.<br>Because of that, one must truly learn to treasure the present, treasure the time spent with one&rsquo;s close kin. After all, one did not know when they might not be able to see them again...<br>The parting might not necessarily be due to death. However, sometimes, one would no longer be able to meet one&rsquo;s close kin after parting with them. It was beyond one&rsquo;s control...<br>&ldquo;Rustle~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, footsteps sounded from behind Chu Feng. He turned around and saw that it was Song Ge.<br>Song Ge arrived beside Chu Feng and sat down.<br>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you spend more time with your father?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;He has passed,&rdquo; said Song Ge.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was greatly alarmed to hear those words. He immediately looked to the smithy and, when the walls disappeared before his eyes, he saw that Old Freak Tang was peacefully lying beside Song Ge&rsquo;s mother.<br>However, he showed no signs of life. He had indeed passed.<br>Fortunately, Old Freak Tang had a smile on his face as he passed. It meant that his wish had come true, and he passed in peace.<br>&ldquo;You must&rsquo;ve cried yourself dry, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Song Ge.<br>He asked that because he noticed that Song Ge was not crying.<br>Song Ge shook her head. She said, &ldquo;Although I feel some regret, I am already very fortunate. At the very least, I managed to meet him before he passed. I learned who my father was. Furthermore&hellip; he even stood up for me and obtained justice for me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Compared to before when I did not have a father and did not know whether my father was alive, I am extremely content.&rdquo;<br>Song Ge&rsquo;s face was brimming with smiles as she said those words.<br>Although her smile was very faint, one could tell that she was truly able to accept this unpleasant fact, and had cheered up.<br>Suddenly, Song Ge said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Asura, thank you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why thank me?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;My father told me that you were the one urging him to reunite with me. If it wasn&rsquo;t for you, he might not have reunited with me before his death,&rdquo; said Song Ge.<br>&ldquo;I feel that he would&rsquo;ve reunited with you even if I hadn&rsquo;t shown up,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; Song Ge revealed a faint smile again.<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. This is something my father wanted you to have. I don't know what it is, and he refused to let me see it. He only told me to hand it to you.&rdquo; Song Ge took a scroll from her Cosmos Sack and handed it to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng had a rough idea what the scroll was as he accepted it from Song Ge.<br>Upon opening it and reading its contents, it was exactly as he had expected. The scroll contained the curse techniques.<br>In the end, Old Freak Tang had decided to help Chu Feng.<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng and Song Ge buried Old Freak Tang and Song Ge&rsquo;s mother.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your plan now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you want to go to the Watermirror Paradise, they would likely welcome you with open arms," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t wish to join any sect. I only want to stay here and accompany my parents," said Song Ge.<br>&ldquo;Are you planning to stay here forever? Cultivators need to encounter opportunities to grow," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Everyone has a different happiness that they strive for. Perhaps to me, being ordinary is being happy," said Song Ge.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, go ahead and stay here. If the opportunity presents itself, I will come see you in the future," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one that said those words. You&rsquo;d best not deceive me.&rdquo; Song Ge extended her little finger as she spoke.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng smiled. Then, he placed his own little finger onto hers and hooked her finger. &ldquo;Rest assured, I will not deceive you.&rdquo;<br>Then, Chu Feng and Song Ge chatted for a long while, until deep into the night, Song Ge suddenly fell asleep.<br>Martial cultivators did not feel sleepy unless they were extremely tired. Song Ge was evidently extremely tired...<br>As Song Ge fell asleep on Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulder, he took out the scroll and began to meticulously study it.<br>As he studied, Chu Feng suddenly clenched his hands. His heart was trembling violently.<br>After Chu Feng gained understanding of the curse techniques, he suddenly came to a realization.<br></p></div>
