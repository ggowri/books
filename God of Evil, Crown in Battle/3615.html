        <div> - Still Having Doubt<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, Chu Feng still had yet to completely fuse with the secret skill.<br>Thus, Chu Feng was only able to sense that the secret skill was very powerful, but did not know exactly what its use was, or how powerful it was.<br>Furthermore, he was unable to use the power of the secret skill.<br>If he wanted to attain complete fusion, Chu Feng needed to make the secret skill submit to him of its own will. The secret skill would have to seal away its own consciousness, and willingly hand over its power to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Trash, even if you seal this Exalted in your body, you will never be able to use this Exalted&rsquo;s power! Release this Exalted at once! Otherwise, I will devour your soul!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, ear-piercing roars were heard. It was the secret skill that had assimilated into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, the Descent of the Demon Exalted.<br>Sure enough, it was unwilling to cooperate with him. It could also be said that it held Chu Feng in contempt. Otherwise, it would not act so arrogantly.<br>&ldquo;Let me ask you a question. Are you unwilling to lend me your power?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Trash like you wants to receive this Exalted&rsquo;s power? Ask yourself this: are you worthy of my power?&rdquo; The Demon Exalted secret skill said.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled faintly. He did not bother to argue with it. Instead, with a thought, a surge of power engulfed the secret skill.<br>&ldquo;Bastard! What did you do to this Exalted?!&rdquo;<br>Fear appeared in the voice of the Demon Exalted secret skill.<br>&ldquo;You dare to try to seal this Exalted&rsquo;s mouth?! This Exalted will kill you... I&rsquo;m going to dismember your body into ten thousand pieces, wu&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Soon, the voice of the Descent of the Demon Exalted disappeared completely from Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>Although Chu Feng needed it to be willing to enter complete fusion with him in order to obtain its power, and would not be able to use its power should it be unwilling, he was capable of shutting it up.<br>This was thanks to the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. That secret skill was no small matter. Its power was rather overbearing too.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s help, Chu Feng would not be able to assimilate with the secret skill.<br>However, as long as the secret skill had been assimilated into his body, Chu Feng gained a certain amount of control over it. Although he was unable to obtain its power, he was capable of suppressing it.<br>At the very least, he would not allow it to act impudently within his body.<br>&ldquo;How was it? This guy is quite something, no?&rdquo;<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted looked to Chu Feng. He knew that Chu Feng would be able to sense the power of that secret skill after having it assimilated into his body.<br>&ldquo;It is indeed a rare and powerful secret skill. Thank you for this gift, senior,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist to express his thanks.<br>&ldquo;Ever since this old man created it, I had always wanted to find an owner for it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, no one could subdue that fellow. Thus, I have never been able to find a suitable owner for it. That said, this old man feels that you, boy, possesses the ability to subdue it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, this old man will still have to remind you that that fellow is not so easily subdued. You will have to put forth a lot more effort,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;This junior is untalented. However, this junior feels that I will, sooner or later, be able to subdue it,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Very well. That is the confidence that a young man should have.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, this place was especially created by this old man for the purpose of training and survival. It's rather special.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Staying here for too long is not good for you. Thus, you should go and bid your farewell to Wang Qiang and the others,&rdquo; as the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted spoke, he opened a spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;Senior, in that case, when are you going to fuse with Wang Qiang?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Chu Feng was still worried.<br>Even though Chu Feng and the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted were chatting merrily, even though the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted had given him a very powerful secret skill, what the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted had done to Chu Feng earlier left a very deep impression on him.<br>Even though the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted said it was merely a test, and Chu Feng was unable to refute him, he felt that it did not seem to purely be a test.<br>That killing intent, that ruthlessness&hellip; they were all so real.<br>Thus, Chu Feng felt even greater worry for Wang Qiang. He truly wanted to be able to personally witness the fusion between Wang Qiang and the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. Otherwise, he would not be at ease.<br>&ldquo;The power of the Void Sacred Tree still has to undergo transformation. There will still be some time before Wang Qiang and I undergo fusion.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, after fusing, we will still need some time to adapt. You don't have to worry about the fusion. Nothing will go wrong in the fusion between Wang Qiang and I,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Senior, actually, this junior has a question.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior is already so powerful without a vessel. Why do you insist on having a vessel?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The vessel will have their own consciousness. When you&rsquo;re inside the vessel&rsquo;s body, you will have to mentor the vessel, and also lose your own freedom. To an expert of your level, wouldn&rsquo;t you lose out enormously?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Wang Qiang must&rsquo;ve told you about the reason why we have to undergo fusion, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that young friend Chu Feng is not at ease with this old man,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;This junior wouldn&rsquo;t dare. This junior is merely still puzzled,&rdquo; Chu Feng would naturally not admit that he was still skeptical of the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. Since you want to know, this old man can tell you why.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man is not human. It is due to the constitution of my body that I need a vessel.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though this old man currently possesses a certain amount of power, I cannot maintain my condition forever. I&rsquo;ve already waited long enough. I am at my limit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, this is a place that I&rsquo;ve specially created. If I am to leave this place, I will lose all my power and die.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is why I need a vessel. Only by having a vessel will I be able to continue to live, and truly enter the martial cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You can also say that this old man is doing this because I have no alternative.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, when the time is ripe, this old man will be able to gain true freedom. At that time, I will no longer need a vessel. My vessel and I will be able to part ways, and live our lives separately.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, that would require a lot of fortunate encounters. It is not something that I can express with a few words.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Most helpless of all, after Wang Qiang and I fuse, although this old man will still possess his power, I will not be able to use it. The future will all depend on Wang Qiang.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I do not help him in his growth, this old man will never be able to separate from him. Only by him becoming more powerful will this old man have a chance to break free from him, and gain a body that belongs to me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for Wang Qiang&rsquo;s safety, you do not have to worry about that. This old man will not harm him. Not only do I need him, but I am also very fond of him,&rdquo; explained the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for your explanation, senior,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Then, Chu Feng chatted with the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted some more before exiting through the spirit formation gate.<br>When Chu Feng saw Wang Qiang again, he did not mention anything.<br>He did not mention the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s test that nearly took his life.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that he believed in the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s words. Instead, it was because Chu Feng knew very well how powerful the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was.<br>If the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted truly wanted to cause harm to Wang Qiang, neither he nor Wang Qiang would be able to contend against him. In fact, they could not even resist him. They could only accept their fate.<br>Thus, Chu Feng could only choose to believe in Wang Qiang.<br>He believed that Wang Qiang would be able to take care of the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>At that moment, the spirit formation gate leading out of that place had opened up.<br>Wang Qiang, Zhang Yanfeng, Zhang Boyi, Zhang Shirui, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted and all the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen stood before the spirit formation gate to see Chu Feng off.<br>Chu Feng took a glance at his body. Bloody wounds were appearing on his body. Although they were very faint, they were still present.<br>Furthermore, he could feel faint paint from the bloody wounds, and this condition was spreading.<br>That was a phenomenon caused by being rejected by that world. That world was constructed by the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted as a temporary residence. It was indeed unsuitable for him to stay there long term.<br>Chu Feng truly had no choice but to leave.<br></p></div>
