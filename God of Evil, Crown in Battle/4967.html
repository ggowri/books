        <h1>Chapter 4966</h1>
        <div>: Sima Xiangtu<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The 136 formation nails were made out of 136 different materials, combined together to form 136 types of formations. Every single one of them was unique.<br>Despite the cruel exterior, the nails were supplying gentle energy to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, nourishing his body. Even though he was trapped in place, he wasn&rsquo;t in a feeble state at all. If anything, he was more energized than ever.<br>&ldquo;Brother Yuankong, you should have seen everything that has happened earlier, right? You do have a good eye for disciples. That disciple of yours&hellip; has already surpassed his master,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren told the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>It turned out that he was aware of Chu Feng and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s relationship all along.<br>&ldquo;Did you get afraid with just that? Then you&rsquo;ll have much more to look forward to. That disciple of mine possesses true capabilities. It&rsquo;s no use even if you choose to kneel down and beg for mercy now. Chu Feng won&rsquo;t let you off,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>It turned out that Master Yin Ren was Sima Xiangtu, a friend of the Ox-nosed Old Daoist while they were still juniors.<br>The two of them were talented world spiritists, and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist used to harbor unreserved trust for Sima Xiangtu. However, as the Ox-nosed Old Daoist became the strongest world spiritist of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy, envy started breeding in the heart of Sima Xiangtu.<br>When the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had a life-and-death duel with Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, Sima Xiangtu made use of the opportunity to feed the Ox-nosed Old Daoist a bowl of poisoned soup, causing the latter to perform worse than expected and lose to Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted.<br>Everyone thought that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist died in that battle, and Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted naturally became the most powerful world spiritist of the Ancestral Martial Galaxy.<br>As for the culprit, Sima Xiangtu, he left the Ancestral Martial Galaxy for the Nine Souls Galaxy under a new identity.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had been searching for Sima Xiangtu over the years, and he finally found clues about the latter&rsquo;s whereabouts. When he parted ways with Chu Feng at the Dragon Clan back then, his goal was to look for Sima Xiangtu.<br>He did manage to achieve his goal.<br>The only problem was that Sima Xiangtu was no longer the same person he used to be. He had become much stronger. The Ox-nosed Old Daoist fell in defeat and ended up becoming a captive to Sima Xiangtu.<br>Sima Xiangtu used his eyeball as a confinement formation, bringing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist everywhere he went and allowing him to see everything that was going on.<br>&ldquo;Brother Yuankong, you have changed. You weren&rsquo;t such a braggart before. A mere brat who could only frantically flee from me a moment ago; did you think that I would be afraid of someone like that?&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu asked.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only saying that because you don&rsquo;t understand Chu Feng. He&rsquo;s unlike those young masters of reputable clans. As long as there&rsquo;s a breath left in him, the ones who will eventually die are indubitably his enemies.<br>&ldquo;Sima Xiangtu, you have infringed on his reverse scale. Nothing can save you anymore. The countdown on your life has started,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist spoke confidently, as if he could already see a guillotine hanging above Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s head.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. It would be troublesome if I gave Chu Feng time to grow. He could potentially become a threat. However, with how sentimental Chu Feng is, once he learns that his master is in my grasp&hellip; don&rsquo;t you think that he will feel obliged to make a move?&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu asked with a devious smile.<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist wasn&rsquo;t worried at all.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng will come to save me, but that fellow doesn&rsquo;t fight a losing battle. You may use me as bait, but you ought to pray hard that he doesn&rsquo;t come. If he does, the one who will suffer is you,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;Trying to scare me? You&rsquo;re really looking down on me if you think that you can intimidate me with such words.<br>&ldquo;Brother Yuankong, you should know how valuable your and Chu Feng&rsquo;s souls are to me. You don&rsquo;t have to worry; I don&rsquo;t plan on killing your disciple. I can&rsquo;t be bothered to use you to lure him in right now either. He can&rsquo;t escape from my grasp anyway,&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu said with a confident smile.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist burst into laughter. Despite being trapped by Sima Xiangtu, he showed no fear.<br>&ldquo;What do you need their souls for?&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao suddenly asked.<br>He sensed that both she and Xian Miaomiao were just tools for Master Yin Ren too.<br>&ldquo;Young lass, he cultivates a unique skill that requires the tribute of high-quality souls. Did you naively think that he&rsquo;s here to treat your affliction? All he&rsquo;s doing is to strengthen your soul so that you would be of greater use to him,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re intending to use my soul to cultivate?&rdquo;<br>Princess Xiaoxiao stared at Sima Xiangtu in horror.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. It&rsquo;s such a pity that your Nine Souls Sacred Clan doesn&rsquo;t have too many people who are useful to me. Many people in your clan are doomed to die,&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu said.<br>&ldquo;Our Nine Souls Sacred Clan has treated you well. Why are you doing this? Do you still have a conscience?&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao roared angrily.<br>Sima Xiangtu only laughed in disdain.<br>&ldquo;Conscience? What can conscience do? If your father had a conscience, he wouldn&rsquo;t have become the clan chief. Your Nine Souls Sacred Clan is far dirtier than I am. I doubt that even you, Princess Xiaoxiao, haven&rsquo;t really done much good in the world yourself. Since we&rsquo;re all just using each other, what&rsquo;s the point in talking about meaningless morals and principles?&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu said.<br>He grabbed Princess Xiaoxiao and placed her into the confinement formation trapping the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. The formation then contracted back into the form of an eyeball, and he popped it back into his eye socket.<br>By this point, it was impossible for anyone to tell that the eyeball was actually a confinement formation.<br>&hellip;<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng and the others had appeared elsewhere. It was the Divine Deer who had brought them there.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I&rsquo;m begging you. Please lend me your strength. I need it just this once. As long as you aid me in saving Princess Xiaoxiao, I&rsquo;m willing to do anything you ask of me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He had been begging the Divine Deer for a while now. The latter had only brought Shengguang Baimei, Shengguang Buyu, and Daoist Niantian with him, leaving Princess Xiaoxiao behind.<br>Putting aside his ties with Princess Xiaoxiao, Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s life was now tied to her as well. He couldn&rsquo;t just leave them to the lurch.<br>The problem was that they didn&rsquo;t have the strength to stand against Master Yin Ren now, unless the Divine Deer was willing to lend its unfathomable power to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brat, I&rsquo;m already being magnanimous by saving you, but you&rsquo;re still demanding more? Why don&rsquo;t you ask me to get rid of that old man for you instead?&rdquo; the Divine Deer spat in displeasure.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was unwilling to give up just like that, but the Divine Deer wasn&rsquo;t willing to listen to his justification.<br>&ldquo;Brat, get your own position clear. I only chose to save you because you have some talent in you. I&rsquo;m doing this out of goodwill, not obligation. I have no reason to save that woman. If you treasure her and wish to protect her, do it yourself. I don&rsquo;t have that much time to bother with your personal affairs.<br>&ldquo;Also, I ought to remind you that my trial for you is soon approaching. If you aren&rsquo;t able to grow to a level that satisfies me, it would only mean that you&rsquo;re unworthy of my strength. If so, I&rsquo;ll be finding someone else,&rdquo; the Divine Deer said.<br></p></div>
