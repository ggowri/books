        <h1>Chapter 4013</h1>
        <div> - So Powerful<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng&rsquo;s current condition was not a disguise.<br>In fact, he hadn't removed the golden gas on his own. Rather, the time limit had arrived, and the power had dispersed on its own.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was suffering from its backlash.<br>That said, he still tried his hardest to stay awake.<br>At that moment he was staring at the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted with a threatening gaze.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for you to keep your promise,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I, Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, am always one to keep my word.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since I&rsquo;ve said that I will release them should you remove your power, I will definitely do so.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only will I spare them, but I will also not make things difficult for you. Our debt can be written off with a single stroke.&rdquo;<br>Not only did the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s words sound very good, but he was actually doing exactly as he'd said.<br>He swung his sleeve through the air, and blood immediately permeated his surroundings. With that, the Mystic Cave Saints began to scream miserably.<br>Whilst they appeared miserable, the crimson rope that had enveloped their bodies was immediately removed from them.<br>Once the crimson rope was removed, their pained appearances were greatly alleviated.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura.&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints were covered in wounds.<br>However, they did not flee after being freed. Rather, they all flew over to Chu Feng's side. They&hellip; wanted to treat his injury.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before they could even reach him, they were all restricted by a strong power.<br>It was the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>Even though the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had released the Mystic Cave Saints, the two of them had captured them.<br>&ldquo;This is not me going back on my word. Them capturing the Mystic Cave Saints has nothing to do with me.&rdquo;<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted spread his hands wide and shrugged his shoulders.<br>However, it was obvious that he had anticipated that there would be people amongst the crowd that would not allow the Mystic Cave Saints to escape safely once he released them.<br>Likewise, they would not allow Chu Feng to escape.<br>His so-called keeping his promise was nothing more than a shameless act.<br>&ldquo;You all&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had a furious look on his face upon seeing that. However, there was nothing he could do.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that Chu Feng had not anticipated that such a thing would happen.<br>Unfortunately, there was nothing he could do about it. He knew that he had fallen into an absolutely passive state the moment the Mystic Cave Saints were captured.<br>That said, even though he had anticipated that such a thing would happen, he still felt extremely furious.<br>The feeling of being toyed with by others was the thing that he disliked the most.<br>&ldquo;Wind Lightning Sword Sect, Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain, you all remember what you&rsquo;ve done here.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng stared at the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster with a killing-intent-filled gaze.<br>&ldquo;Young friend, you&rsquo;re powerless to even protect yourself, yet you&rsquo;re actually threatening us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t bother with threats anymore.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since we dared to do this, we do not fear your retaliation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hand over the treasures you&rsquo;ve obtained from the stone case, and we will spare you and your friends. Else, do not blame us for being ruthless.&rdquo;<br>Once the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s Sectmaster said those words, his oppressive might began to distort. His oppressive might was starting to oppress the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;I am the one who took your treasures! If you&rsquo;re capable, come at me!&rdquo; Chu Feng shouted angrily.<br>Although his furious shout was very resounding, it revealed to the crowd how powerless he was at that moment.<br>Everyone could tell that the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster had seized Chu Feng&rsquo;s weakness.<br>No matter how capable he might be, he was unable to do anything about it.<br>He'd hit a brick wall.<br>What they didn&rsquo;t know was that if that mysterious treasure were still with him, Chu Feng would definitely come to terms with them and hand it over.<br>Unfortunately, the mysterious treasure had already entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s dantian.<br>Even if he wanted to hand it to them, it was already impossible for him to do so.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a flash of light flew over from the distant sky.<br>Once that item appeared, heaven and earth started crumbling, and everything shattered. The surrounding space turned into primal chaos. In the terrifying pitch-black darkness, a crimson ray of light was rapidly flying over.<br>That was a crimson sword.<br>That sword was so powerful that it was truly capable of utterly destroying heaven and earth.<br>Seeing that sword, even the expressions of the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster changed enormously.<br>They both felt an enormous threat from that crimson sword.<br>However, that crimson sword was not aimed at either the Wind Lightning Sword Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster or the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster. Rather, it was flying straight at the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Foolishness.&rdquo;<br>Facing that terrifying crimson sword, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted not only did not have any fear on his face, but he instead smiled mockingly.<br>He raised his arm, aimed his palm at the crimson sword, and shook it.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The thousand-meter-long crimson sword bringing destruction everywhere it passed actually stopped in midair.<br>Even though the crimson sword was still trembling violently and roaring like a herd of beasts, it was unable to move forward.<br>It was as if the crimson sword had been stopped by an invisible bastion.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be, it&rsquo;s the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the overwhelmingly powerful crimson sword that was unable to move forward, the crowd felt puzzled.<br>Because of that, they all turned their gazes to the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>Even though the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted did not display any might, so much so that even his cultivation&rsquo;s aura was still concealed, his movement made the crowd realize that it was very possibly him who had stopped that terrifying crimson sword.<br>Of course, this was merely the crowd&rsquo;s guess. They could not be certain, since the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted did not show any signs of him releasing his power.<br>At the moment when the crowd were confused, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted suddenly shouted, &ldquo;Break!&rdquo;<br>Then, his clothes fluttered and a powerful aura swept forth, covering the surroundings.<br>At that moment, everyone could sense the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>Rank four Utmost Exalted. The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was also a rank four Utmost Exalted.<br>Most importantly, following his loud shout, he not only released his aura and oppressive might, but the powerful crimson sword actually began to crumble.<br>In the blink of an eye, the mighty crimson sword turned into countless crimson fragments that scattered down from the sky.<br>Even the shattered space returned to normal.<br>&ldquo;This old guy, he&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted and how powerful he was, the expressions of even the leaders of the five great powers&rsquo; became complicated.<br>As fellow rank four Utmost Exalteds, they were all able to sense how powerful that crimson sword was.<br>They all felt that crimson sword to be a thorny problem to take on. Yet, it had effortlessly been resolved by the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>Because of that, they realized that even though they were all rank four Utmost Exalted, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted still possessed stronger battle power than them.<br>Just when the crowd were all astonished by how powerful the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was, he began to mutter quietly. &ldquo;I was originally planning to spare you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, you refused to value your life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, don&rsquo;t think about leaving here safely.&rdquo;<br>Then, he waved his sleeve, and boundless attractive power was released from his cuff<br>That attractive power immediately brought forth violent gales. Not only were the sand and rocks moving, but even the clouds were being sucked into his sleeve.<br>One thing worthy of mentioning was that even though that attractive power was extremely powerful, the crowd were not affected by it.<br>Yet, two figures appeared in the distant sky.<br>They seemed to have been captured by the attractive power. No matter how they struggled, they were unable to break free.<br>Frantically trying to escape, they were rapidly pulled from far away into the crowd&rsquo;s field of view.<br>It turned out that those two people were Zhao Hong and Han Xiu, who had left earlier.<br></p></div>
