        <h1>Chapter 3618</h1>
        <div> - Unfathomable<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;This woman?&rdquo;<br>Soon, Chu Feng discovered that the red-dressed woman was actually behind the monster.<br>The natural oddity monster was not only roaring, but it also revealed a frightened look on its face.<br>It was fleeing. It was afraid of that red-dressed woman.<br>Although Chu Feng did not know how the woman had accomplished that, the natural oddity was certainly fleeing.<br>How could this be said to be luring out the natural oddity? That woman was clearly forcing it out.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng could not help but wonder exactly what level of cultivation that woman possessed to make her so powerful.<br>&ldquo;Girl, it seems like your help is no longer needed,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Yu Sha.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Yu Sha answered.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Roars sounded nonstop. Being chased by that woman, the natural oddity entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s grand formation.<br>After entering Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation, the natural oddity started to scream, as his formation was specially made to handle and refine it.<br>The natural oddity began to struggle violently. It seemed to be about to be flee from the grand formation.<br>This was the reason why Chu Feng had stated earlier that he might need Yu Sha&rsquo;s help.<br>However, he didn&rsquo;t need her help anymore. The reason for that was because that red-dressed woman was present.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>The woman shot forth her palm, and the natural oddity that had managed to half escape from Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation was forcibly beaten back into it.<br>With that, the natural oddity had no more chance of escape. Whenever it escaped slightly, it was immediately beaten back by the woman&rsquo;s powers.<br>With that, the natural oddity&rsquo;s body began to be refined, decompose and turn into gaseous flames within the grand formation.<br>In the end, the enormous natural oddity was completely refined by Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation. Only a lump of gaseous flames remained.<br>The woman did not say anything. She took out a red bottle gourd and began to collect the gaseous flames.<br>Truth be told, Chu Feng was feeling slightly worried.<br>After all, that woman possessed unfathomable strength. He was no match for her. If she were to truly take away all of the gaseous flames from the natural oddity, he would not be able to stop her.<br>However, surprisingly, that woman only ended up collecting half of the gaseous flames before stopping. Furthermore, she turned around and began to leave.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaving already?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we get to know one another first?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He was truly curious about that woman. He was curious about her strength, as well as her mysteriousness.<br>This woman was capable of discovering the natural oddity and seeing through Chu Feng&rsquo;s concealment formation.<br>However, it was obvious that she was not a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Otherwise, there was simply no reason for her to request his cooperation. She could very well set up the refinement formation herself, and then capture and place the natural oddity within it to refine it.<br>Although she was not a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, she was able to see through Chu Feng&rsquo;s concealment formation and track down the natural oddity. This meant that she possessed quite the ability.<br>Unfortunately for Chu Feng, that red-dressed woman was simply too cold. She completely ignored him, and did not bother to respond to his question. Just like that, she disappeared before him.<br>&ldquo;That is truly a strange woman,&rdquo; Chu Feng muttered.<br>Then, he looked to the unconscious Kong Tianhui. After verifying that he was fine, Chu Feng opened his spirit formation gate and sent the remaining half of the gaseous flames into it.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be training now. Before I wake up, do not disturb me,&rdquo; Yu Sha&rsquo;s voice was heard.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Chu Feng answered.<br>Later on, Chu Feng was able to see Yu Sha beginning to refine the gaseous flames and entering a training state like Her Lady Queen.<br>Being able to see everything inside his world spirit space, Chu Feng was also able to see Her Lady Queen, who was still training with her eyes closed.<br>Seeing her, Chu Feng felt a little bit upset. Her Lady Queen had been in a state of training for quite some time already.<br>Coming from the small Qing Province of the Nine Provinces Continent, Chu Feng had left the Nine Provinces Continent and entered the Eastern Sea Region, then the Holy Land of Martialism, the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm and the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. During all that time, Her Lady Queen had accompanied him. After so many years, she had become a part of him that he could not part with.<br>Even though Her Lady Queen was still in his world spirit space, he was unable to converse with her, and she was unable to witness what he had experienced.<br>Chu Feng was not only feeling unused to it. Instead, he also felt sad.<br>If Her Lady Queen was awake, Chu Feng would not have given Yu Sha the natural oddity he refined just then. Instead, he would have definitely given it to Her Lady Queen.<br>After all, in terms of owing someone, Chu Feng felt that he owed Her Lady Queen the most.<br>&ldquo;My dear Eggy, when will you wake up?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Does that piece of stone really possess such enormous power to make you train for so long?&rdquo;<br>Seeing Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s rosy complexion, Chu Feng knew that she was fine.<br>Her Lady Queen was merely focused on training. However, Chu Feng was still unable to keep himself from letting his imagination run wild. He was deeply afraid that Her Lady Queen would encounter some sort of mishap.<br>However, Chu Feng did not dare to interrupt her. He was afraid that he would disturb her training.<br>Thus, he could only wait, wait for Her Lady Queen to wake up.<br>&ldquo;I hope that my Eggy will wake up quickly. My days without you are truly unbearable.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng sighed. Then, he looked to Kong Tianhui.<br>Chu Feng crouched down and placed his hand on his body.<br>As his aura entered Kong Tianhui&rsquo;s body, Kong Tianhui twitched slightly.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Like a corpse that had suddenly moved, Kong Tianhui sat up abruptly.<br>&ldquo;My goodness, am I dead?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eh, that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, am I still alive?&rdquo;<br>Kong Tianhui was in a complete panic upon waking up. He was on the verge of crying. It was only after he saw Chu Feng that he managed to calm down.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re naturally not dead. I&rsquo;ve already refined that monster,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;My dear mother, it&rsquo;s all thanks to you, brother Chu Feng. When I was swallowed by that monster, I thought I was screwed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eh? That&rsquo;s strange, where&rsquo;s that beauty? She couldn&rsquo;t possibly have been killed by that monster, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s truly a pity. That beauty was so very beautiful. She was simply the most beautiful person I&rsquo;ve ever seen&hellip;&rdquo; Kong Tianhui had a look of regret.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t curse her. She&rsquo;s alive and kicking,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Ah? Not dead? Then where did she go?&rdquo; asked Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;She left,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;She left? Where is she going?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you manage to speak to her? What&rsquo;s her name? Brother Chu Feng, tell me about her,&rdquo; Kong Tianhui asked in succession. It would appear that he was very interested in that woman.<br>However, Chu Feng did not reveal anything to him. After all, he knew nothing about that woman himself. In fact, he had only spoken a couple words with her.<br>Then, Chu Feng and Kong Tianhui continued on with their journey.<br>However, they did not proceed toward Divine Body Royal City. Instead, they were heading towards a place called the Divine Armament Villa.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s one thing I need to tell you about.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Divine Armament Villa is a place that we of the younger generation use to gather.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it isn't limited to only our Divine Body Royal City, Monstrous Scared City and Ancestral Martial Dragon City&rsquo;s younger generations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though our three cities are withdrawn from worldly matters, the Ancestral Martial Starfield is still the territory of the Starfield Master Realm. Thus, as a show of respect, we also invite the Starfield Master Realm&rsquo;s younger generations to participate in the gathering.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, you'll be meeting Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo,&rdquo; Kong Tianhui spoke with a proud look on his face.<br>However, Chu Feng asked, &ldquo;Who are Wuming Yuanzhi and Wuming Xiongmo?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fuck! You don&rsquo;t even know the two of them?!&rdquo; Kong Tianhui opened his mouth wide as he looked to Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
