        <h1>Chapter 4526</h1>
        <div>: You Can Give It a Try<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;How dare you say that we are trash? It looks like you ants are tired of living?&rdquo;<br>As expected, the woman from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect immediately blew her top upon hearing those words. She shot a vicious glare at the elders and disciples of the Starfall Holy Land.<br>The others from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect that were with her even whipped out their weapons. It looked as if they would mutilate the person who said those words earlier as soon as they found out who he was.<br>On top of that, they even exerted their powerful oppressive might on those from the Starfall Holy Land as well.<br>They were all at mid Exalted level!<br>With such cultivation, it was more than enough for them to massacre everyone from the Starfall Holy Land.<br>Put aside the others, even Xia Yun&rsquo;er was shocked into silence.<br>While she knew that they were guests invited by the Ancestral Martial Dragon City, she didn&rsquo;t expect them to actually be this powerful. Even a random member of their group already possessed cultivation greater than their Lord Holy Master.<br>After all, their Lord Holy Master was only at early Exalted level.<br>&ldquo;Who is it? Who is the one who dares to spout nonsense before these lords? Step forward and admit your mistake!&rdquo;<br>Realizing that the situation was bad, the elders also began searching for the person who spoke up earlier to push him forward and resolve the situation.<br>They had no intention of allowing the folly of a single person to push their entire Starfall Holy Land through the gates of hell.<br>But it was then that something weird happened. No matter how those from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect or the Starfall Holy Lnad searched, they were unable to find the person who had spoken earlier.<br>&ldquo;Those who resort to snatching remnants away from others, does that not fit into the stereotype of what trash is?&rdquo;<br>While everyone was still looking around in confusion, the voice sounded once more.<br>Just like before, the voice came from the midst of the crowd, but somehow, there was not a single person who was able to find the one speaking.<br>&ldquo;Bastard! Kill them all!&rdquo;<br>The woman eventually lost her patience and roared at the crowd from the Starfall Holy Land.<br>But as soon as those words were spoken, the voice sounded from the midst of the Starfall Holy Land once more, &ldquo;I advise you not to act recklessly, for I&rsquo;ll make sure that anyone who dares to make a move will pay for their insolence with their lives.&rdquo;<br>By this point in time, the crowd from the Starfall Holy Land were already on the verge of bursting into tears. It was clear that the owner of the voice was planning to send their Starfall Holy Land to its doom!<br>If not for the fact that even those from the Starfall Holy Land were unable to find the owner of the voice too, they would have surely charged at him and ripped away his mouth!<br>Meanwhile, the lips of the woman from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect quivered in sheer fury as she looked at those from the Starfall Holy Land with eyes reminiscent of a beast.<br>At this point in time, many of those from the Starfall Holy Land had already begun pleading for their lives. Some of them even fell to their knees to beg for mercy. However, the woman had no intention of stepping down at all, instead bellowing coldly, &ldquo;Kill them all. Don&rsquo;t even spare a single one of them! Make these arrogant ants disappear from the face of the world!&rdquo;<br>As soon as that order was issued, those around the woman raised their blades and slashed down toward the crowd from the Starfall Holy Land.<br>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!<br>A powerful gale burst forth as dirt rose into the air. Several sword rays whizzed forth toward the crowd from the Starfall Holy Land simultaneously.<br>Due to their lacking cultivation, the crowd from the Starfall Holy Land couldn&rsquo;t even see the sword rays clearly at all. All they felt was the aura of death approaching closer and closer toward them.<br>Hu!<br>And just as they thought that they were goners, the aura of death suddenly vanished without a trace.<br>Bewildered, they raised their heads to take a look, only to find that they were all still alive and kicking. None of them were injured at all.<br>On the other hand, the group from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect were staring with their eyes widened and mouths agape. It seemed as if they were staring at something incredibly frightening.<br>This left the crowd from the Starfall Holy Land feeling a little bewildered as to what was going on.<br>The reason why the group from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect was acting in such a manner was because they saw clearly with their own eyes how their attacks were easily deflected earlier. That made them realize that there was actually someone who had a cultivation higher than them amidst the crowd from the Starfall Holy Land!<br>&ldquo;Do you know who I am? I am the personal disciple of the sectmaster of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, Xie Feifei!&rdquo;<br>It was hard to tell whether it was out of rage or self-preservation, but the woman finally revealed her true background.<br>Pu!<br>Pu!<br>Pu!<br>In the next instant, a horrifying sight happened.<br>The heads of those who had made a move against the Starfall Holy Land earlier suddenly flew into the air, causing fresh blood to splatter all over the body of Xie Feifei.<br>They had been decapitated!<br>The owner of the voice actually did as he said.<br>At this moment, everyone from the Starfall Holy Land were horrified.<br>They were just not frightened by the fact that someone dared to kill someone from the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, but more than that, they realized that the owner of the voice was actually far stronger than what they thought.<br>Earlier, out of deep fear of the Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, they had said many disrespectful words to the owner of the voice. They couldn&rsquo;t help but shudder just to think about how they might have just made a powerful enemy for their Starfall Holy Land.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please spare our lives!&rdquo;<br>One of the more timid elders of the Starfall Holy Land quickly began begging for mercy.<br>&ldquo;Elders, I don&rsquo;t think that it has been long since we last parted. Why does it seem like you aren&rsquo;t able to recognize my voice anymore?&rdquo;<br>The voice sounded from the crowd yet again.<br>But this time around, tracing the source of the voice, the crowd finally saw the true appearance of the voice&rsquo;s owner.<br>This time around, what appeared on the faces of those from the Starfall Holy Land were looks of delight, especially for Xia Yun&rsquo;er and the others who were acquainted with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er ran up to Chu Feng and called out to him with a radiant smile on her ravishing face.<br>Everyone could see that the Holy Daughter of the Starfall Holy Land was feeling extremely agitated at the moment.<br>&ldquo;I must say, Miss Xia, I can still understand it if others aren&rsquo;t able to recognize my voice, but why aren&rsquo;t you able to tell as well? Tsk tsk, you have really disappointed me greatly.&rdquo;<br>Despite the words that Chu Feng was saying, there was a faint smile on his lips.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip; I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Even though Chu Feng was joking around, Xia Yun&rsquo;er somehow took his words seriously. An anxious look appeared on her face as she scrambled to find an explanation, but nothing came to her mind at all.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng&hellip; So your name is Chu Feng?<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember you. Since you dared to kill the members of our Flying Feather Heavenly Sect, I&rsquo;ll make sure that you&rsquo;ll never walk out of the Ancestral Martial Dragon City alive!&rdquo;<br>A furious roar sounded from Xie Feifei.<br>She had slumped down on the ground with blood splattered all over her. Her body was trembling slightly.<br>Despite speaking tough words, it was visible to everyone that she was terrified.<br>&ldquo;I am Chu Feng from the Chu Heavenly Clan. If you wish to exact vengeance, come and look for me!&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Heavenly Clan? Very well, I&rsquo;ll remember it,&rdquo; Xie Feifei spat out with gritted teeth before she rose to her feet and made her way out of the area.<br>But just as she tried to stand up, she was shocked to realize that her body wouldn&rsquo;t budge at all. What was even more terrifying that Chu Feng had suddenly flitted right in front of her like an elusive phantom.<br>Shoosh!<br>Chu Feng stretched his hand forth to grab the woman&rsquo;s face tightly and lifted her off the ground.<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, am not fond of bullying women, but that does not mean that I won&rsquo;t kill you.<br>&ldquo;You have directed your killing intent toward me and the Starfall Holy Land earlier. If not for the fact that my cultivation was above yours, the ones who would have been killed here would not be your men but the tens of thousands of people from the Starfall Holy Land.<br>&ldquo;It might have been your men who made a move, but you&rsquo;re the mastermind behind it all. The one who is most deserving to die here is no other than you! Do you want to know why I&rsquo;ve kept you alive despite so?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Xie Feifei.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill me&hellip; Don&rsquo;t kill me!&rdquo; Xie Feifei didn&rsquo;t respond.<br>Instead, she howled in agony as tears trickled down her cheeks. She was really scared out of her wits.<br>However, Chu Feng carried no pity for her. He knew that the one before her was a vicious woman who wasn&rsquo;t worthy of his pity.<br>&ldquo;The reason why I&rsquo;ve spared you thus far is because I have a task for you. Return to your Flying Feather Heavenly Sect and tell those from your sect that the person who killed your sect members is me, Chu Feng. I&rsquo;ll be heading to the Ancestral Martial Dragon City next, so if you wish to exact vengeance, you can look for me there.<br>&ldquo;However, the same words still apply. If anyone dares to raise his hand against me, I&rsquo;ll take his dog life. If you doubt my words, you can give it a try.&rdquo;<br>After saying his piece, Chu Feng flung his wrist and threw the woman onto the floor.<br></p></div>
