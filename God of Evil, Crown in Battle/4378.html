        <h1>Chapter 4377</h1>
        <div>: Living Hell<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;My gosh, how did this happen?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That aura&hellip; Is it an innate ability?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment, does that mean that&hellip; he possesses a Divine Power too?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible. How can that be? How can a person possess so many abilities at once?&rdquo;<br>Ma Chengying and the others were dumbstruck. Their faces had turned completely pale by now.<br>While they were frantically shaking their heads, refuting the possibility, they knew deep in their hearts that it was indeed a Divine Power. The powerful energy that was emanating from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body couldn&rsquo;t be anything else other than that.<br>But this shouldn&rsquo;t have been possible!<br>Someone who had a Heavenly Bloodline shouldn&rsquo;t have a Divine Power too!<br>Putting aside Ma Chengying and the others, even Li Rui was shocked speechless too.<br>Faced against a rank six Utmost Exalted level Chu Feng, he had no fear at all, especially after he had eaten a forbidden medicine. He felt that the match was already set, and victory was his to claim.<br>But all of a sudden, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation surged once more, reaching rank seven Utmost Exalted level. Furthermore, he was relying on his Divine Power for this&hellip;<br>Was it possible of a cultivator to possess a Heavenly Bloodline and a Divine Power simultaneously?<br>And not to mention, use these two different types of powers to raise his cultivation simultaneously?<br>Was this even a feat a human could pull off?<br>He really was a monster! His opponent was not a human but a monster!<br>What was he to do in the face of such a situation?<br>Li Rui and the others felt utterly despaired at this very moment. Chu Feng felt like there was an insurmountable mountain before them that they could never hope to overcome.<br>Hu!<br>But it was at this moment when their morale was at the lowest when a bizarre sight occurred.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s Four Symbols Divine Power had begun dissipating.<br>Following that, the Lightning Armor and the Divine Character Lightning Mark also began dissipating too.<br>And when these sources of power disappeared, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation plummeted too.<br>Rank seven Utmost Exalted level.<br>Rank six Utmost Exalted level.<br>Rank five Utmost Exalted level.<br>Eventually, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation fell all the way back down to rank four Utmost Exalted level.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was stunned. They had witnessed with their own eyes how Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation rose to an incredible level, but all of a sudden, it plummeted back down.<br>This left Li Rui and the others feeling utterly confused.<br>They didn&rsquo;t understand what the current situation was. Why would such a surge of powerful energy suddenly vanish?<br>Could it be that he was putting on a feint earlier?<br>Shoosh!<br>All of a sudden, a sword ray carrying great killing intent burst across the air, flying straight toward Chu Feng.<br>It was from Li Rui. He had exploited this opportunity to make a move.<br>He didn&rsquo;t know what was happening Chu Feng, and he couldn&rsquo;t care less either. All he knew was that this was a golden opportunity to kill Chu Feng, and he had to succeed at all cost.<br>With his rank six Utmost Exalted level cultivation, he should be able to easily curb the rank four Utmost Exalted level Chu Feng.<br>And everything happened just as he had expected.<br>His assault was so abrupt that Chu Feng had no time to react at all.<br>The sword ray had already arrived at incredibly close proximity to Chu Feng, and Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation had already dropped all the way to rank four Utmost Exalted level.<br>Under such circumstances, even if Li Rui hadn&rsquo;t used his Exalted Taboo Martial Skill but the most ordinary oppressive pressure, he would still have been able to utterly decimate Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I won!&rdquo; Li Rui thought gleefully in his heart.<br>Klang!<br>In the next moment, a jarring metallic reverberation sounded in the air.<br>Great ripples of shockwave burst forth, causing the air to shudder in response.<br>In this moment, Li Rui and the others even forgot how to breathe.<br>Chu Feng had managed to block Li Rui&rsquo;s attack. Just like before, it was deflected by the invisible wall around him.<br>&ldquo;You have a treasure on you! It&rsquo;s the power of the treasure and not your spirit power! I don&rsquo;t accept this! I, Li Rui, can&rsquo;t accept this! If you&rsquo;re a man, fight with me with your own capabilities! What kind of cultivator relies solely on his tools in a battle?&rdquo; Li Rui began shouting hysterically at Chu Feng.<br>His voice was filled with indignance and grievance.<br>From his point of view, Chu Feng should have been unable to use spirit power here, but the invisible barrier that was around him was still there, and it even deflected his attack during a critical moment. That only left one possibility&mdash;that invisible barrier was not a world spiritist technique!<br>That would mean that all along, Chu Feng had been deflecting all of his attacks with an external tool.<br>After all that had happened, Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spiritist technique wasn&rsquo;t as formidable as he thought at all. Rather, he simply had a powerful tool on him.<br>This was the only reason he could come up with.<br>&ldquo;What a despicable scum! I thought that he was a genius, but in the end, he&rsquo;s a mere crony who relies on his tools to appear strong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Indeed! Despicable scum, you won unfairly!&rdquo;<br>Ma Chengying and the others began to insult Chu Feng as well.<br>It was mere cheap provocations, and they knew it too.<br>However, they had no choice but to give it a try. They could only hope that Chu Feng would somehow fall for it and foolishly toss away the tool and fight with them with his own strength.<br>Otherwise, given that even Li Rui&rsquo;s strongest attack was unable to breach the barrier, they didn&rsquo;t stand a chance at all.<br>&ldquo;Heh!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t affected by their words at all. He couldn&rsquo;t care less what they thought. Instead, he looked at them quietly as a sinister smile formed on his lips.<br>He began to release a burst of energy that was visible to the eye, such that his clothes began to flutter in the air.<br>Upon seeing the burst of energy, Li Rui and Ma Chengying&rsquo;s morale suddenly deflated, as if they had suffered a huge blow.<br>Their mouths were agape, but their tongues were tied. They couldn&rsquo;t find a word to say at all.<br>However, their trembling bodies and dazed looks were more than enough to display the horror that was running through their minds.<br>They could tell that the burst of energy Chu Feng had just released was spirit power. It was spirit power strong enough to rival rank six Utmost Exalted level cultivators.<br>But they were currently in the valley! This was supposed to be a valley that sealed spirit power!<br>So, how was he doing it?<br>&ldquo;Could it be that&hellip;&rdquo;<br>A thought surfaced in Ma Chengying&rsquo;s mind as his face crumbled in despair.<br>If what he was thinking was true, that would explain why Chu Feng&rsquo;s rank seven Utmost Exalted level cultivation would suddenly vanish.<br>In the first place, Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t been relying on any external tools at all. He had managed to find a way to overcome the limitations of the valley and use spirit power in here.<br>That meant to say that he had intentionally retracted his martial power earlier to toy with them. He wanted to give them a ray of hope before plunging them into despair.<br>Awooooooo!<br>The cries of ghosts sounded in the air.<br>Chu Feng had used his spirit power to manifest various lifeforms, but these lifeforms all had savage looks on their faces.<br>They were like human-shaped demons who had come from the deepest level of hell. They held oddly-shaped weapons in their hands that were created for the sole purpose of inflicting suffering on others.<br>What was even more frightening was that there were tens of thousands of these human-shaped demons, and the oddly-shaped weapons they wielded were all different from one another.<br>&ldquo;Milord, we surrender. Please forgive us and spare us!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, please don&rsquo;t kill us. No matter what, we&rsquo;re still disciples of the Soaring Flower Gazebo. If you were to kill us, the Soaring Flower Gazebo wouldn&rsquo;t let you go easily&hellip;&rdquo;<br>It was already apparent what Chu Feng was going to do next, and a few of the disciples swiftly succumbed to their fear and begged for mercy.<br>Even Ma Chengying had fallen to his knees, and he slapped himself viciously as he begged for forgiveness. At this point in time, their only hope was that Chu Feng would show benevolence to them and spare them.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s smile only grew even more sinister as he watched the sobbing Ma Chengying and the others begged for his mercy. There was not the slightest hint of sympathy in his eyes at all.<br>&ldquo;I have already told you. You would do well to kill me, or else you can be sure that I&rsquo;ll show you what living hell looks like.&rdquo;<br>Right after saying those words, the tens of thousands of demons charged right toward Li Rui and the others with their torture tools in hands.<br>Li Rui and the others were bound to the spot due to Chu Feng&rsquo;s oppressive might, such that they couldn&rsquo;t even run or resist at all. Like a fish on a chopping board, they could only watch helplessly as all sorts of torture tools sunk into their flesh.<br>In just an instant, fresh blood had splattered all over the place, and bits and pieces of flesh flew around the area. Miserable cries and screams sounded ceaselessly.<br>A torture session that was even crueler than what Ma Chengying and the others had done to Chu Feng was at play.<br>This mountain valley had already warped into the pits of hell as Ma Chengying and the others suffered the weight of their crimes.<br>Screams echoed within the valley, but nary a sound could be heard beyond the valley. Chu Feng had already sealed the area with his formation, such that no one would be able to find out about the tragedy that was occurring here at this moment.<br>No help would be coming for Ma Chengying and the others, and their suffering had just barely begun&hellip;<br></p></div>
