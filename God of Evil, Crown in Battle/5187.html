        <div>: Assault of the Lightning Clouds<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Why are you asking that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Did you find her or not?&rdquo; Xue Ji asked.<br>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Have you found any clues?&rdquo; Xue Ji pressed on.<br>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t trust Xue Ji even though the latter hadn&rsquo;t expressed any intention to harm him. Naturally, he wouldn&rsquo;t tell her anything he knew about his mother.<br>&ldquo;Alright. You may leave now.&rdquo;<br>Xue Ji waved her hand, urging Chu Feng to leave.<br>&ldquo;What do you intend to do by asking about my mother&rsquo;s whereabouts? Are you planning on exacting vengeance on her?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with narrowed eyes.<br>Regardless of the history between them, he didn&rsquo;t harbor any enmity toward Xue Ji at the moment. Even if it was just out of consideration for Yu Sha, he wouldn&rsquo;t harm her. Not to mention, Xue Ji hadn&rsquo;t expressed any hostile intention toward him so far.<br>That being said, Chu Feng knew that Xue Ji was a vindictive person. She likely harbored a grudge toward his mother for kidnapping her. If she truly intended to exact vengeance on his mother, he would immediately categorize her as an enemy.<br>While he had never met his mother before, he would never allow anyone to threaten her.<br>Pft!<br>Unexpectedly, Xue Ji burst into laughter at his words.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you became dumber over the years. Exact vengeance on your mother, you say? Do you think that I have the strength for that? Not even the Demon Spirit King would be capable of that!&rdquo; Xue Ji said with a laugh.<br>&ldquo;Then why are you asking that? Are you worried about me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You can take it that way. Hurry up and leave. If the Demon Spirit King sees you, I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t protect you.&rdquo;<br>Xue Ji shot Chu Feng a cold gaze before turning away from him. It was an abrupt change in attitude, but Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t surprised at all. He had always seen her as an unfathomable and dangerous woman, and that was how she had always treated him.<br>Chu Feng left the palace together with Old Cat.<br>&ldquo;How is it, Brother Chu Feng? Do you believe me now?&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>&ldquo;Yes, you haven&rsquo;t lied to me on this matter. I&rsquo;ll put aside Xue Ji&rsquo;s debt for now, but you haven&rsquo;t compensated me for the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Aiya, it&rsquo;s just a mere God Bestowment Bamboo Slip. I&rsquo;ll pay you back soon enough! Actually&hellip; this might be an opportunity to do so. Brother Chu Feng, I don&rsquo;t like to brag, but I have a special prophetic constitution that grants me uncannily sharp intuition when it comes to certain things. My gut feeling is telling me that there&rsquo;s a huge fortuitous encounter awaiting us in the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm.<br>&ldquo;What do you say, Brother Chu Feng? Shall we join hands and do something big together?&rdquo;<br>Old Cat rubbed his hands together as he looked at Chu Feng with heated eyes.<br>&ldquo;I asked Xue Ji about this matter earlier. She didn&rsquo;t tell me what it is, but it seems to be related to why the Demon Spirit King has chosen to reside here. She also told me that there are many experts hidden in the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm who are after this fortuitous encounter, and they are all of a similar tier as the Demon Spirit King,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you don&rsquo;t look like a coward to me. Are you really intending to heed Xue Ji&rsquo;s advice?&rdquo; Old Cat asked.<br>&ldquo;It looks like you really aren&rsquo;t afraid. Very well, let&rsquo;s head over to take a look then,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like it!&rdquo; Old Cat exclaimed excitedly.<br>&ldquo;Speaking of which, you don&rsquo;t seem that concerned about your disciple anymore?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I know what kind of person you are. You won&rsquo;t hurt my disciple now that you have confirmed that I haven&rsquo;t lied to you,&rdquo; Old Cat replied.<br>Chu Feng chuckled upon hearing that.<br>The two of them began making their way toward the gaseous flames. Fearing that they might be at a disadvantage for arriving late, Old Cat rushed ahead with its fastest possible speed.<br>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do. We&rsquo;re still moving too slowly. Brother Chu Feng, bring out your world spirit and have it take us there,&rdquo; Old Cat said.<br>&ldquo;My world spirit is currently cultivating. I won&rsquo;t call for him unless it&rsquo;s truly urgent. You&rsquo;re roughly around the same strength as him anyway, so it doesn&rsquo;t make a difference,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>There was no way he would tell Old Cat that the Asura King had been sealed away.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true. He&rsquo;s stronger than me. This is an urgent situation. We might miss out on the fortuitous encounter if we arrive late!&rdquo; Old Cat exclaimed.<br>Boom boom boom!<br>Thunderous rumbles suddenly echoed behind Chu Feng and Old Cat.<br>Startled, the two of them turned around and found a huge congregation of storm clouds behind them. Lightning bolts were crackling everywhere.<br>To make things worse, these storm clouds were swiftly heading in their direction.<br>They immediately understood that these weren&rsquo;t ordinary storm clouds but a phenomenon caused by a powerful cultivator.<br>&ldquo;There are indeed many hidden experts in the Demoncoffin Ordinary Realm. That fellow must be heading in the direction of the gaseous flames too. Let&rsquo;s step out of the way first,&rdquo; Chu Feng said, only to realize that Old Cat had already started running off to the side.<br>Both of them had the same thought in mind.<br>It was likely that the cultivator who had induced the phenomenon was even stronger than Old Cat judging from how quickly the storm clouds were moving. Given so, it would be best for them to avoid a confrontation.<br>&ldquo;The heck! Brother Chu Feng, something seems wrong here. Don&rsquo;t you think that the storm clouds are heading in our direction?&rdquo; Old Cat exclaimed in horror.<br>To their astonishment, the storm clouds didn&rsquo;t head straight toward the gaseous flames but instead changed their direction to pursue them.<br>&ldquo;It is heading in our direction,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br></p></div>
