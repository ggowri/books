        <h1>Chapter 3808</h1>
        <div> - Difference In Strength<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Interesting. It would appear that you will not shed a tear until you see your coffin.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re so stubborn, I feel that I hold the duty to make you realize one thing,&rdquo; that Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist said to Chu Feng.<br>With a smile, Chu Feng asked with faux-concern, &ldquo;What thing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You need to understand that even though you and I are both Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists, there is still a difference in our strength.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, that Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist released boundless spirit power.<br>The spirit power soared into the sky. Soon, it gathered and formed a giant creature over a thousand meters tall.<br>As that giant creature was composed of spirit power, it was extremely vivid and lifelike. It simply resembled an actual living creature.<br>&ldquo;So powerful.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the giant spirit formation creature, the people of the younger generation were so terrified that they immediately rushed to the side.<br>That Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist&rsquo;s giant beast made through his spirit formation did appear extremely imposing and terrifying.<br>&ldquo;What you said is correct. There is a disparity between those of the same level," Chu Feng said as he looked to the giant spirit formation beast.<br>That Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist chuckled. &ldquo;Heh. It&rsquo;s too late for you to say that now. Even if you admit defeat, you still have to receive my punishment.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng raised his hand and pointed his finger. Then, a boundless amount of spirit power turned into a beam of light that shot straight towards that Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>The beam of light was extremely fast. Before the crowd could even react to it, they were able to hear a series of explosions. Following that, overwhelming spirit power swept forth in all directions.<br>When the crowd managed to react to what had happened, they discovered that the giant spirit formation beast had disappeared. The spirit power scattering all over the plaza had the same aura as that of the giant spirit formation beast.<br>Because of that, the crowd realized something terrifying - that giant spirit formation beast had been shattered to pieces.<br>Because of that, the crowd quickly turned their gazes to the Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Upon doing so, the crowd all gasped with shock.<br>That world spiritist was no longer standing where he had stood previously. Instead, he was flung back tens of thousands of meters away.<br>He lay on the ground. He only managed to prop his upper body up with great difficulty. As for Chu Feng, he still stood where he'd been. Seeing that, the crowd realized who was actually the stronger person in the match.<br>Indeed, there was a disparity in strength among people of the same level. Merely, the stronger person was naturally not that miserable-looking Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Instead, it was Chu Feng, who had managed to breach the stone pillar.<br>&ldquo;You damned bastard! Just because you&rsquo;re incompetent yourself, you actually used a treasure. You are simply despicable and shameless!&rdquo; That Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist shouted angrily.<br>He felt that he was completely disgraced. Thus, he was unwilling to accept that he had been defeated and, like a scoundrel, decided to proclaim that Chu Feng had only defeated him because he had borrowed the strength of a treasure.<br>&ldquo;Treasure?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, there&rsquo;s no sign of any treasure&rsquo;s power. I only felt spirit power.&rdquo;<br>The people present were all world spiritists, and all possessed sharp perception. Even if they were unable to see what had happened clearly, they were able to determine certain things with their perception.<br>Because of that, the great majority of them all knew that Chu Feng had not used any treasure.<br>Instead, it was that other fellow who was being a sore loser.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng looked behind that world spiritist and spoke loudly, &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;ve come, why not show yourself?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;<br>Many of the people present felt confused by his words.<br>They looked over in the direction Chu Feng was looking, but were unable to see anything.<br>&ldquo;Tsk, tsk, tsk&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the crowd was confused, a strange laughter sounded.<br>Following that, a total of ten figures appeared behind that Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Those ten people all wore world spiritist cloaks with hoods covering their heads.<br>Their outfits were identical to the outfit of the Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist Chu Feng had defeated. The only difference was that their world spiritist cloaks were not emitting any spirit power. Thus, it was impossible to determine what level their world spiritist techniques were at.<br>That said, ever since he had felt the existence of those people, even Chu Feng had felt somewhat uneasy. He felt an aura of danger from them.<br>Although he did not know what level of world spiritists those people were, Chu Feng felt much greater danger from those ten than the one that he had defeated.<br>&ldquo;We merely approached slightly, yet he actually discovered us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That brother is indeed powerful. Don't feel excessively depressed to be defeated by him, for he possesses the capability to defeat you.&rdquo; One of the ten people said to the person on the ground.<br>After he finished saying those words, he turned to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Brother, since we&rsquo;ve all managed to sneak in here through cheating, I will not act noble and virtuous. That World Spirit Jade in your hand is mine for sure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you going to hand it to me directly, or do you want me to snatch it from you?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the others present were all shocked. Even Chu Feng felt surprised.<br>No wonder. The younger generation world spiritistists present were clearly all so weak. Yet, so many experts had suddenly appeared. Furthermore, they were people capable of putting pressure on him.<br>It turned out that they were simply not people of the younger generation. Instead, they had snuck in through deceitful means.<br>&ldquo;Cheating? I, Asura, am above that sort of thing,&rdquo; said Chu Feng. His tone was filled with mockery.<br>&ldquo;What? Are you trying to imply that you&rsquo;re a person of the younger generation?&rdquo; that person asked after hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng said those words, that person burst into boisterous laughter.<br>It was not only him. His co-conspirators also started laughing heartily. Their laughter was filled with mockery.<br>From their mocking laughter, Chu Feng realized that they simply did not believe that he was a person of the younger generation.<br></p></div>
