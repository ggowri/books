        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, do you require such a treasure?&rdquo; </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Does it need to be extremely potent?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, elder.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Your best bet is the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Are you intending to participate in their trial?&rdquo; </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master had previously used the Seven Realms Edict to declare that they would be holding trials to select prodigies to nurture. The news shook the entire world of cultivation. It had been many years since the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had taken in outsiders, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I intend to give it a try,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was among the first batch of people to learn about the news. He initially didn&rsquo;t intend to participate in the trials because of the enmity he harbored toward the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, but for </span><span>Eggy&rsquo;s</span><span> sake, he was willing to go back on his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was his next destination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master, I wish to go too,&rdquo; Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> suddenly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of going when your world spiritist techniques are so weak?&rdquo; </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> chuckled. She knew that Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> simply wanted to accompany Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I just want to expand my horizons. It&rsquo;s a rare event.&rdquo; Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> tugged her master&rsquo;s arms coyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Fine </span><span>fine</span><span>, I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> was overjoyed, knowing that their safety would be guaranteed if her master tagged along as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go too,&rdquo; Qin Hang said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, an old man immediately interjected, &ldquo;Young master, Lord Clan Chief instructs you to return as soon as possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take long,&rdquo; Qin Hang protested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young master, it won&rsquo;t do this time,&rdquo; the old man said as he passed a secret letter to Qin Hang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Hang received the secret letter, and its content immediately seeped into his mind. A frown formed on his forehead as he fell silent. Then, he reached into his Cosmos Sack and passed a token to Chu Feng, saying, &ldquo;Chu Feng, feel free to drop by my Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect once you&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was stunned upon seeing the token, especially those from the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect. It was the highest-tier invitation token that only a few in the sect were entitled to. Qin Hang had only given this invitation token to one person before&mdash;Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll definitely drop by if an opportunity arises.&rdquo; Chu Feng accepted the token, knowing that it was a token of Qin Hang&rsquo;s goodwill. It would be rude for him to turn the gift down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Qin Hang had many of the negative traits that young masters of powerhouses </span><span>tended to have, he wasn&rsquo;t a bad person by nature. A more apt word to describe him was naive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of light suddenly streaked across the sky. It moved so quickly that it was only noticeable to </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> and one of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s elders. Chu Feng vaguely sensed something flying over too, but he couldn&rsquo;t perceive it with his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flash of light eventually fell on </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, my apologies. I need to attend to some urgent business, so neither </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> nor I can accompany you anymore,&rdquo; </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry about me, elder. I can handle it by myself,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He figured what he had sensed earlier might have transmitted news to </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span>, leading her to suddenly change her mind. He didn&rsquo;t mind it too much, but Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> couldn&rsquo;t accept it in the spur of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master, what happened? Is it that urgent?&rdquo; Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very urgent,&rdquo; </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you need me to follow you?&rdquo; Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> was clearly expressing her desire to follow Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> looked at Chu Feng contemplatively before answering Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s</span><span> question, &ldquo;You have to come with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You should listen to your master, </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span>,&rdquo; Chu Feng advised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> pouted her mouth in indignance. In the first place, she was already planning to listen to her master, since the latter had helped her greatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I hope you all the best. I&rsquo;ll await the day your name echoes throughout the world of cultivation,&rdquo; </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s entrance trial was currently the largest event. Anyone who stood out in the event would surely become renowned, and she thought that Chu Feng stood a good chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Thank you for your kind words, elder,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You have to succeed, Chu Feng. I&rsquo;ll be able to brag about you if you succeed. No one will be able to say I&rsquo;m a bad judge of character anymore,&rdquo; Qin Hang said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng responded with a stiff smile. He found it hard to smile when Eggy was in a terrible state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You have to take care of yourself, Chu Feng,&rdquo; Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> said with a gentle voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You too. Work hard on your cultivation lest I shake you off,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> finally broke into a smile and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I won&rsquo;t let you shake me off. I am a prodigy now too.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite feeling heavy-hearted at having to part ways with Chu Feng, her mood easily lifted at a few words from him. This showed just how much Chu Feng meant to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng, Qin Hang, Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span>, and her master went on their separate way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Qin Hang left for the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect, whereas Chu Feng made a stop at the Martial Cultivator Commerce Guild. </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> brought Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> to a remote forest in the Immortal Stream Upper Realm, where not a single person or </span><span>monstrous beast could be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master, aren&rsquo;t we leaving this realm?&rdquo; Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> replied as she took out a sphere manifested from a spatial formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By forming a series of hand seals, both she and Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> were brought into the realm inside the spatial formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master, what are you doing?&rdquo; Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> asked with a frown. She could tell that this was a sealed space, which suggested that her master was planning to imprison her. &ldquo;Master, you know that I have always listened to you. Since I have agreed to leave with you, I won&rsquo;t escape on my own accord to look for Chu Feng. There&rsquo;s no need for you to&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span>,&rdquo; </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> suddenly interjected with a gentle but firm voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll imprison you for three months. You&rsquo;ll still be my good disciple if I fetch you within three months, but if I don&rsquo;t, I want you to leave this place on your own and return to your parents&rsquo; side. Don&rsquo;t speak of me to anyone, and don&rsquo;t tell anyone you&rsquo;re my disciple.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao</span><span> noticed that something was amiss and asked with a concerned voice. &ldquo;Did something happen?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry about it. Listen to me, all right?&rdquo; </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> gently touched Long </span><span>Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s</span><span> cheek before leaving the realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ventured deeper into the remote forest and carefully buried the spatial realm at a hidden location before finally taking her leave. Then, she quickly made her way to the Immortal Stream Upper Realm&rsquo;s ancient teleportation formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ancient teleportation formation was located at a remote location, and it was rarely used. However, there were over a dozen people dressed in cloaks that concealed their appearances, gathered around the ancient teleportation formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Have you settled your disciple?&rdquo; an elder asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have accepted her,&rdquo; the elder said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you butting into my business?&rdquo; </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> sneered in displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Calm down. I just think that accepting a disciple will shake your heart. We&rsquo;ll be fighting a tough battle, after all. I don&rsquo;t want anything to happen to you,&rdquo; the elder replied with a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of answering his words, </span><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> asked, &ldquo;Are you certain it&rsquo;s starting?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way I would joke about this, especially when our enemy is the Totem Dragon Clan. The others are gathering at the moment. It has been a long time since we last gathered together to do something huge. My heart beats in excitement just thinking about it,&rdquo; the elder exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> fell silent. She had been preparing for this day for a very long time, but now that it was happening, she only felt a heavy heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. We should make our move now,&rdquo; a person in the crowd said before entering the ancient teleportation formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ningyu</span><span> </span><span>Shangren</span><span> and the others quickly followed him. Their destination?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Totem Galaxy.</span></p></div>
