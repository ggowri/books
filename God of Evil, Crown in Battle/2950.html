        <h1>Chapter 2949</h1>
        <div> - Return of the Discarded Child<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Everyone was confused. This demon was extremely powerful, and possessed such intense murderous desire, so why would it suddenly stop and spare them?<br>Confused, the crowd's gazes all turned to Chu Feng.<br>They all knew that what had caused that demon to leave was not their formation or them. Instead... it was Chu Feng.<br>That said, Chu Feng was also feeling extremely puzzled. He was wondering exactly what that little girl was.<br>Chu Feng felt that there seemed to be a special sort of sentiment in the way that little girl treated him.<br>That was the reason why the little girl decided to spare him. That was also the reason why Chu Feng asked the little girl if she knew him.<br>However, the little girl did not give him an answer.<br>The departure of the little girl caused Chu Feng to feel perplexed. His frame of mind also became complicated.<br>How could such a dangerous being be related to him?<br>"Boom~~~"<br>Right at that moment, a loud explosion was heard. The crowd were able to see that it was that little girl. The black gaseous flames that she had turned into had broken through the vast formation that had sealed off the region.<br>At that moment, the crowd had astonished expressions on their faces.<br>It turned out that the enormous formation that had sealed off the region was simply unable to contain her.<br>That demonic being was simply too frighteningly powerful. Not to mention them, even their Law Enforcement Hall&rsquo;s Vice Hall Master Chu Xuanzhengfa would not be a match for her.<br>Thinking of this, the crowd started to feel lingering fear.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you alright?&rdquo; Chu Xingde walked over to Chu Feng while supporting Chu Xingren.<br>It could be seen that Chu Xingren was very seriously injured, as he was unable to even walk on his own.<br>Even though that was the case, Chu Xingren was still deeply concerned for Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety.<br>&ldquo;I am fine. But, senior you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt very remorseful. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn&rsquo;t have let go of the little girl. If he hadn&rsquo;t handed the little girl to Chu Xingren, Chu Xingren would not have been so seriously injured.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I am fine. That said, Chu Feng, is that person truly your friend?&rdquo; Chu Xingren used a weak voice to ask.<br>Even though he was seriously injured by the little girl, he had no intention of blaming Chu Feng. In fact, he even thought that little girl might be Chu Feng&rsquo;s friend.<br>&ldquo;That is not my friend. I do not know who she is. However, I feel that she might know me. That was the reason why I asked her if she knew me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren both nodded. They were able to tell that Chu Feng was not lying to them. Furthermore, it seemed that the two of them trusted Chu Feng a lot.<br>Afterwards, Chu Xingde began to heal Chu Xingren&rsquo;s injuries. Chu Feng also used his world spirit techniques to assist Chu Xingde.<br>[1]<br>Through the efforts of the two men, Chu Xingren&rsquo;s injuries were quickly improved.<br>Although Chu Xingren was very seriously injured, his soul was fortunately unharmed. It was as he declared, he was fine. That said, he would need some time to recover completely.<br>Afterwards, Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren brought Chu Feng with them and began to fly toward the Chu Heavenly Clan. As for the members of the Law Enforcement Hall, they remained to continue searching for that demonic being.<br>Even though they were all no match for that demonic being, they still had to find her tracks. This was an obligation of the Law Enforcement Hall.<br>It was only at that moment that Chu Feng realized that the Chu Heavenly Clan was not only the overlord of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm in name. They were truly protecting the peace of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>While they did not concern themselves with the wars between other powers, they would search for and immediately execute existences like that little girl, existences that were powerful and willfully slaughtered the innocent.<br>At the very least, this was how the Law Enforcement Hall acted. It was no wonder the Law Enforcement Hall possessed such status, even in the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>After journeying for some time, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression turned serious. A surprised expression emerged in his eyes.<br>A vast city stretch had appeared before him. This region was extremely lively. People could be seen everywhere. It was as if a major event was happening, and countless humans and monstrous beasts were gathered there.<br>However, no major event was actually happening. It was merely that the people there were living in a relatively concentrated space.<br>That place could be said to be the place with the highest concentration of people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm that Chu Feng had ever witnessed.<br>That said, there was a very clear contrast before Chu Feng. Right in front of him was a vast city containing an area tens of thousands of miles wide. People were present all over the place, in the sky and on the ground. However, on the other side were mountains and rivers, birds and flowers.<br>That&rsquo;s right. Before him was a vast city filled with signs of human habitation. However, on the other side was a vast amount of mountains and rivers with no sign of human habitation.<br>Separating all of this was a wall.<br>That wall was completely transparent. However, it was visible with a single glance. The reason for that was because of the enormous golden words on the transparent wall: &lsquo;Chu Heavenly Clan.&rsquo;<br>That transparent wall was actually a grand formation, a grand isolation formation that created a border.<br>On one end of the border was where anyone and any power could move about unhindered.<br>As for the other side of the border, it was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory.<br>The reason why there were so many people gathered there was because they wanted to be closer to the Chu Heavenly Clan. They felt that being closer to the Chu Heavenly Clan would be safer.<br>That border isolation formation was extremely powerful. Even a rank one Exalted would not be able to break through it, much less ordinary commoners.<br>However, the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan possessed title plates. With the title plates on their bodies, they would be able to pass through the border isolation formation unhindered.<br>Following Chu Xingde and Chu Xingren, Chu Feng also passed through the grand formation unobstructed.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, although there&rsquo;s still some distance from the main city, we have, speaking precisely, returned to the clan. Only the people of our Chu Heavenly Clan are allowed to enter this land,&rdquo; Chu Xingde said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the Chu Heavenly Clan really does occupy a vast land in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng remembered that Song Xi had mentioned to him before that the Chu Heavenly Clan occupied half of the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>&ldquo;As the overlord of an Upper Realm, that would naturally be the case,&rdquo; Chu Xingde&rsquo;s face was brimming with pride as he said those words.<br>Chu Feng smiled lightly upon hearing those words. He agreed with those words. As the overlord of an Upper Realm, one must possess that sort of drive.<br>Furthermore, the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was so large. Even if only half of its land was available for the masses, it would still be sufficient for the people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm to live in.<br>At that moment, Chu Xingren said to Chu Feng with a requesting tone, &ldquo;Chu Feng, upon returning to the clan, if anyone says anything unpleasant to you, try to tolerate it if you can. Consider it giving Lord Vice Hall Master face.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, it would appear that there are truly a lot of people in the Chu Heavenly Clan that don't welcome me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you might feel uncomfortable upon hearing it. However, I will not keep it from you. What you&rsquo;ve said is very true; there are a lot of people in the clan that do not welcome you, and do not wish for your return to the clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, do you know why Lord Vice Hall Master is so urgent to have you return to our Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; Chu Xingren asked.<br>&ldquo;Senior, can you tell me why?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You must&rsquo;ve heard of the Nine Moons Sacred Domain, right?&rdquo; Chu Xingren asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s Six Great Sacred Vestiges. I have naturally heard of it. I&rsquo;ve also heard that the Nine Moons Sacred Domain is occupied by the Chu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, the Nine Moons Sacred Domain is in our Chu Heavenly Clan. Only the people from our clan are allowed to train in it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you know about the Nine Moons Sacred Domain, you should also know that the Sacred Domain will reveal itself when nine moons appear where it&rsquo;s located, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The pattern of the moons&rsquo; appearance has been grasped by our Chu Heavenly Clan long ago. Soon, it will be the time when all nine moons appear. At that time, the people in our clan, regardless of whether they are of the older generation or of the younger generation, will enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain to train. After all, it is a rare opportunity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, while only the people of our Chu Heavenly Clan are allowed to enter the Nine Moons Sacred Domain, not all Chu Heavenly Clansmen can enter it to train.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, Lord Vice Hall Master is striving for the opportunity for you to enter,&rdquo; Chu Xingren said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you senior. Chu Feng understands now,&rdquo; Chu Feng finally understood that Chu Xuanzhengfa was actually not only trying to have him return to the Chu Heavenly Clan, but he was also trying to get him a rare training opportunity.<br>Taking Chu Xuanzhengfa into consideration, Chu Feng would definitely tolerate what he could.<br>However, Chu Feng was someone with a baseline.<br>If someone dared to trigger a dragon&rsquo;s reverse scale, they would definitely die.<br>If someone dared to trigger Chu Feng&rsquo;s reverse scale, even if it was someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan, even if it were people from the Starfield Master Realm, Chu Feng would definitely not tolerate it.<br>&lsquo;People of the Chu Heavenly Clan, I hope that you all are prepared.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;I, Chu Feng, the discarded child that you all deemed to be trash, has returned.&rsquo;<br><br></p></div>
