        <div> - Terrifying Lightning<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It would appear that I&rsquo;m the one that guessed incorrectly,&rdquo; said the old man from the Dragon Clan.<br>&ldquo;Grandpa Bu, what do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked the girl.<br>&ldquo;That teleportation talisman is not something that ordinary powers would have,&rdquo; said the old man.<br>&ldquo;Could that be something obtained from a remnant?&rdquo; asked the girl.<br>&ldquo;Unlikely,&rdquo; said the old man.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s gaze changed slightly.<br>Then, a faint smile appeared on her face. &ldquo;Interesting.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t this mean that this Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan has courted troubles?&rdquo; asked the girl.<br>&ldquo;They have indeed brought trouble upon themselves. However, seeing as that Chu Feng left, he doesn&rsquo;t seem to intend to make things difficult for the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; said the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s old man.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, things would be boring.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah, the show&rsquo;s over. Grandpa Bu, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;<br>The girl from the Dragon Clan revealed a look of disappointment. Then, she turned around and began leaving. The old man also followed suit.<br>Of course, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen had no idea about their departure.<br>Simply none of them had detected that there were experts from the Dragon Clan secretly observing them.<br>At that moment, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were only filled with worries for Zuoqiu Tiancheng and Zuoqiu Daoyi.<br>However, before the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation&rsquo;s power disappeared, there was nothing they could do.<br>After waiting for some time, the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation&rsquo;s power finally started dissipating.<br>At the same time, the obelisks began to crumble.<br>The Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation collapsed.<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were not concerned about the collapse of the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation. Instead, they all rushed over to Zuoqiu Tiancheng and Zuoqiu Daoyi.<br>&ldquo;Tiancheng, are you alright?&rdquo; the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked nervously after he arrived before Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s expert world spiritists also rushed over. They intended to force out the poisonous bug from Zuoqiu Tiancheng.<br>However, after trying for some time, all of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s expert world spiritists shook their heads helplessly.<br>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?! Are you to tell me that you&rsquo;re all powerless to do anything about it?!&rdquo; the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief shouted angrily.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, that is no ordinary poison. That&rsquo;s a curse. It&rsquo;s an extremely treacherous method. We&hellip; are truly powerless against it. If we are to rashly attempt to remove it we might end up costing young master Tiancheng his life,&rdquo; said the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s expert world spiritists.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you dared to use my son&rsquo;s safety to threaten me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What I hate the most is being threatened.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Men! Go and investigate the origins of that Chu Feng! Find out where he came from!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will make him regret his actions!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will have everyone that knows of this Chu Feng be buried with him! Not a single one shall think about living!&rdquo;<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief began to shout furiously.<br>He was truly enraged. Because of that, he was not only emitting anger, but he was also emitting an overflowing amount of killing intent.<br>Surging killing intent rushed into the sky and covered a radius of tens of thousands of miles. Even the surrounding weather was being affected by the killing intent.<br>Dark clouds covered the region. It was a very terrifying sight to behold.<br>None of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansman dared to say anything.<br>Even Zuoqiu Daoyi, who had been feeling dissatisfied by his father&rsquo;s choice earlier, did not dare to say anything.<br>They all knew how terrifying of an individual their Lord Clan Chief was when he was enraged.<br>If anyone dared to provoke him now, even if they were his clansmen, they would still be courting a disaster of death upon themselves.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eaahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, thunder sounded from above the clouds.<br>The thunder was so ear-piercing that many of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen found themselves unable to withstand it.<br>Many covered their ears, and even tried to use special techniques to protect themselves.<br>They did so because they discovered that merely the thunder was enough to cause many of their Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen to bleed from all seven facial orifices and fall dead to the ground.<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were all terrified.<br>At that moment, they all turned their eyes to their Lord Clan Chief.<br>They thought that it was their Lord Clan Chief who was soaring with rage and had failed to contain his power, causing injury to their clansmen.<br>However, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief also had a confused look on his face.<br>He knew very well that this had not been done by him. No matter how enraged he might be he wouldn&rsquo;t possibly harm his own clansmen.<br>Furthermore, the thunderous roars were growing more and more ear-piercing. It was simply a bit too terrifying.<br>Even the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was afraid.<br>Merely the thunder was already that powerful.<br>If the lightning that brought forth that thunder were to strike down from above, what sort of catastrophe would that be?<br>Likely, not even he would be able to face the lightning.<br>Looking carefully at the sky, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen became even more horror-stricken.<br>They were stunned to discover that there was endless lightning in the clouds. Like roaming dragons, bolts of lightning galloped rapidly through the clouds.<br>Every single one of those lightning bolts emitted a devastating aura.<br>Most importantly, the lightning that filled the sky could strike down at them at any moment.<br>If the lightning were to land, they would definitely be killed.<br>They could tell that it was not an abnormal sign. Instead, it was a truly terrifying power -- a power so strong that it could wipe out their entire clan.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, what is going on?&rdquo;<br>In a panic, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen all turned their gazes to their Lord Clan Chief.<br>As matters stood, they&rsquo;d realized that it was not their Lord Clan Chief that had brought forth the terrifying lightning.<br>They knew that not even their Lord Clan Chief would be able to condense such terrifying lightning.<br>What they didn&rsquo;t know was that not even their Lord Clan Chief knew what was going on.<br>Why would such a terrifying sight appear above their heads out of the blue?<br>Could it have been caused by the destruction of the Ancient Heavenly Lightning Formation?<br>Even their Lord Clan Chief had no idea what had caused the terrifying sight before them.<br>&ldquo;Run away! All clansmen, we are to leave this place immediately!&rdquo;<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief gave an order. This was the only decision possible for him to make. He needed to have his clansmen flee from such a dangerous place.<br>If they didn&rsquo;t flee now, they would definitely be killed once the lightning struck down on them.<br>Once the order was given, many Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen soared into the sky and attempted to flee.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after those people started fleeing, several lightning bolts struck down from the sky.<br>The lightning struck the people that had taken flight.<br>Without exception, all the people that were struck by the lightning died.<br>Their deaths were extremely thorough. Not even a single hair remained. All of them had been reduced to ashes.<br>Seeing that, the remaining Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were terrified and didn't dare to move.<br>They realized that the lightning had come for them. The lightning was not allowing them to leave. If they attempted to flee, they would be killed.<br>&ldquo;May I know who this expert might be, and why they are making things difficult for my Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>At the crucial moment, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was the one to speak.<br>He had realized that the lightning had not formed naturally. Rather, it had most likely been created by someone.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>After he said those words, a strange scene occurred.<br>The terrifying thunder stopped.<br>The terrifying lightning also began to disappear.<br>The Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen became completely confused. They had no idea what had happened.<br>Even though the lightning had disappeared, the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen were still staring at the sky. Fear still covered their eyes.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that they were overly worried. It was simply that the lightning earlier had been too terrifying.<br>Suddenly, the black clouds in the sky began to change.<br>Seeing the change that occurred to the black clouds, the expressions of the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clansmen changed enormously. Lingering fear filled their faces.<br>Even the Zuoqiu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had the same reaction.<br>The reason for that was because the black clouds had transformed into a series of words.<br>&lsquo;Dare to touch Chu Feng and your entire clan will be wiped out!&rsquo;<br></p></div>
