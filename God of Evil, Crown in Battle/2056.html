        <h1>Chapter 2055</h1>
        <div> - It&rsquo;s You<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the World Devastator Immortal raised the Imperial Armament in his hand. His face, which was still mutilated beyond recognition, revealed a malevolent gaze. Like a smile, yet not a smile. He looked to Chu Feng and shouted, &ldquo;Chu Feng, in the end, you still lost to me. I am going to kill you to avenge my son!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Die!!!&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, the World Devastator Immortal hacked his Imperial Armament down at Chu Feng. He was planning to hack Chu Feng in two.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>Blood splattered all over, drenching Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>Sensing the warm blood, Chu Feng revealed a shocked expression.<br>The reason for that was because he was unharmed. However, the World Devastator Immortal&rsquo;s arms were gone. They had fallen to the ground not far from where he stood. Together with his arms, his Imperial Armament had also fallen to the ground.<br>It turned out that the blood was not Chu Feng&rsquo;s blood. Rather, it was the World Devastator Immortal&rsquo;s blood. The World Devastator Immortal&rsquo;s arms had been instantly sliced off by someone the moment he had planned to hack Chu Feng to death.<br>At that moment, it was not only Chu Feng who revealed an expression of shock. The World Devastator Immortal also revealed an expression of even greater shock. He stood there as if he was petrified. It was as if he had forgotten about the pain of the insects biting his body.<br>Stunned. The World Devastator Immortal was completely stunned. He was stunned by the scene before him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is not someone that you can kill.&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the two men were extremely shocked and puzzled, a sweet-sounding voice was heard. Following that, a beautiful woman appeared between the World Devastator Immortal and Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you?!&rdquo;<br>This woman was extremely and alluringly beautiful. However, it was precisely this woman who had caused Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes to open wide in even greater shock.<br>The reason for that was because this woman wearing a black dress was one of the trusted aides of the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, Xue Ji.<br>&ldquo;Xue Ji, why are you helping him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You!!!!&rdquo;<br>When the World Devastator Immortal discovered that the person who had sliced off his arms and prevented him from killing Chu Feng was actually Xue Ji, the shock in his eyes grew many times stronger. At the same time, he also felt endless fury.<br>Evidently, this sort of ending was not something that he had anticipated.<br>&ldquo;You are not qualified to ask me that question,&rdquo; However, Xue Ji merely smiled coldly at the World Devastator Immortal&rsquo;s question. Then, coldness flashed through her eyes as she suddenly waved her sleeve. Following that, black gaseous flames appeared.<br>After the black gaseous flames appeared, they turned into a black sickle. The black sickle streaked across the World Devastator Immortal&rsquo;s body and instantly hacked him in two.<br>When the World Devastator Immortal&rsquo;s body that was hacked in two fell down to the ground, he no longer possessed any aura. He had died. With merely a single strike, Xue Ji had killed the World Devastator Immortal, a rank eight Martial Emperor.<br>When the World Devastator Immortal died, his eyes had remained open. He had truly died with remaining grievances.<br>However, at that moment, Chu Feng was frowning, and his eyes narrowed. When Xue Ji had killed the World Devastator Immortal earlier, he had finally sensed her cultivation. She was a rank five Martial Emperor.<br>Xue Ji&rsquo;s cultivation was only that of a rank five Martial Emperor. However, Xue Ji, a rank five Martial Emperor, had managed to kill the World Devastator Immortal, a rank eight Martial Emperor, with only a single attack.<br>This meant that Xue Ji possessed a heaven-defying battle power even more frightening than Chu Feng&rsquo;s. She should possess a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting seven levels of cultivation.<br>Ordinary Martial Emperors possessed heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation.<br>Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao only possessed heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation.<br>However, this mysterious woman by the name of Xue Ji actually possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting seven levels of cultivation. That was truly too frightening.<br>&ldquo;Exactly who are you?&rdquo; Chu Feng stared at Xue Ji and asked very seriously. At this moment, all of the unease that he had felt before was confirmed. This woman by the name of Xue Ji was no ordinary character.<br>&ldquo;My, my, my&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No matter what, we&rsquo;ve known each other for years. I could be said to have watched you grow up. How could you not recognize me this quickly?&rdquo;<br>Xue Ji then walked toward Chu feng with a beaming smile on her face. She extended her lily-white hands in a teasing manner and lifted Chu Feng&rsquo;s chin.<br>To meet such a beauty face-to-face at such close range was something that would cause ordinary people to blush and their heartbeat to accelerate. However, Chu Feng, on the other hand, had a huge change in expression.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you?!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng thought of something. After reaching that conclusion, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart felt as if it were surging.<br>The reason for that was because the answer that Chu Feng thought of was truly too astonishing. That answer...<br>Was that Xue Ji was Chu Feng&rsquo;s other Asura World Spirit.<br>In other words, she was the Asura Evil Spirit that he had released at the Nangong Imperial Clan.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve finally remembered? But, to only recognize me now even after we&rsquo;ve seen each other this many times, you have truly and bitterly disappointed me,&rdquo; Xue Ji released Chu Feng and sighed with feigned disappointment.<br>However, her sigh caused Chu Feng&rsquo;s body to shiver. Xue Ji had confirmed Chu Feng&rsquo;s speculation. Indeed, she was the other Asura World Spirit in his body.<br>&ldquo;You actually managed to take human form?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, you were clearly an Evil Spirit. How did you manage to imitate a human this perfectly?&rdquo; Chu Feng was extremely puzzled.<br>The way he saw it, Xue Ji&rsquo;s appearance was extremely human-like. There was not the slightest trace of a world spirit&rsquo;s aura at all, much less an evil spirit&rsquo;s aura.<br>&ldquo;Did you really think that servant girl by the name of Eggy was stronger than me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You were mistaken. When the two of us are compared, I am evidently the stronger one.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, do not compare me to that Eggy. Furthermore, do not compare me to other world spirits. They are at a completely different level from me,&rdquo; Xue Ji said.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what do you want?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a frown. Even though Xue Ji had saved him, he still felt a great amount of danger from her.<br>&ldquo;What do I want? Great question.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, what you should be worried about right now is not me. Rather, it&rsquo;s that guy from the Dark Hall with the same Inherited Bloodline as you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now&hellip; he has fused with the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts. Even though he has yet to completely grasp that power, it is only a question of time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that you will all undoubtedly be killed today. However, if you are willing to beg me, I am willing to save your life so that you can die a bit later,&rdquo; A strange gaze appeared in Xue Ji&rsquo;s beautiful eyes.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng started to frown. When Xue Ji had been in his body, Chu Feng had already been able to sense the dense killing intent that she had toward him.<br>When she had been released from his body, she had felt enormous hatred for him. In fact, she had wanted to kill him back in the Nangong Imperial Clan.<br>Yet, what sort of situation was this? Chu Feng was right before Xue Ji. Yet, not only was she not planning to kill him, she had instead saved him. Chu Feng was truly confused as to her purpose.<br>&ldquo;All of you will die!!!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the frightening voice of the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master sounded again. Following that, boundless killing intent surged forth.<br>&ldquo;As I said, you should not be worrying about me, but instead be worrying about that guy right now,&rdquo; Xue Ji said with a beaming smile.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng hurriedly turned his gaze back to the direction of the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master. He discovered that the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master seemed to have managed to gain control over his power again.<br>Not only did the oppressive might that suppressed the Alliance Army grow stronger, the suffocating sensation also grew stronger and stronger. In fact, the aura of death could clearly be felt now. It was as if they would be killed the very next moment.<br><br></p></div>
