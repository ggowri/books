        <div> - Entering The Sea Of Lightnings<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once that voice was heard, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s disciples and Lu Yingzhou were all greatly alarmed.<br>Even though the people outside were unable to hear Chu Feng, they were able to see the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s disciples and Lu Yingzhou&rsquo;s reactions and expressions.<br>Seeing their expressions, the spectators outside were all confused.<br>They did not understand why the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s disciples would suddenly become so afraid.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>It was only when an explosion occurred and dust and bits scattered throughout the sky that the crowd came to a sudden realization.<br>They were able to see that what had shattered was the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Beast Trapping Talisman.<br>The enormously precious Ancient Era&rsquo;s Beast Trapping Talisman had been destroyed.<br>After the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Beast Trapping Talisman shattered, the crowd outside saw a figure appearing before the people from the All-heaven Sect.<br>As for that person, he was none other than the Chu Feng who was previously trapped in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Beast Trapping Talisman.<br>Chu Feng was actually standing there completely uninjured.<br>Most importantly, he had managed to escape the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Beast Trapping Talisman.<br>It was obvious that he was the one who had destroyed the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Beast Trapping Talisman!<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Even though the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Beast Trapping Talisman was capable of trapping and even killing a rank one Utmost Exalted.<br>Even though a rank two Utmost Exalted might also be unable to escape from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Beast Trapping Talisman.<br>It just so happened that Chu Feng was not an ordinary Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Being in possession of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power as a world spiritist had reached that of a rank two Utmost Exalted.<br>Furthermore, his battle power far surpassed that of ordinary rank two Utmost Exalted.<br>On top of that, as the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Beast Trapping Talisman was a spirit formation in itself, it was not difficult for Chu Feng to breach it.<br>Naturally, there was a reason why Chu Feng had waited until that moment to breach it instead of breaching it right away.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; how did you accomplish that?&rdquo;<br>Lu Yingzhou and the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s disciples all looked at Chu Feng like he was a monster.<br>They had no idea that he was able to increase his battle power with the use of his Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.<br>As such, they were unable to comprehend how he had been able to breach the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Beast Trapping Talisman.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve underestimated the Mystic Cave Saints.&rdquo;<br>At the same time, the elders of the All-heaven Sect all had worried looks on their faces.<br>Regardless of what sort of ability Chu Feng had used to breach the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Beast Trapping Talisman, the fact remained that he had broken free.<br>They also knew that Lu Yingzhuo only had a single Ancient Era&rsquo;s Beast Trapping Talisman.<br>Thus, Lu Yingzhuo no longer had any cards up his sleeve capable of contending against Chu Feng.<br>In other words, there was no longer anyone in the spirit formation world capable of confining him.<br>Their six great powers had once again lost the ability to take on Chu Feng. They could only look on helplessly as he did whatever he pleased inside the spirit formation world.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip;. I concede.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Lu Yingzhuo spoke with an apologetic look.<br>Then, he actually bowed apologetically to Chu Feng.<br>Then, he removed the set of armor of his own accord and placed it on his hands.<br>Slowly, he walked over to Chu Feng and respectfully handed the set of armor to him.<br>&ldquo;.......&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph, as the saying goes, a warrior can be killed, but not disgraced.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;His opponent didn&rsquo;t say anything. Yet, he already conceded.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s Supreme Elder is truly disgracing our six great powers.&rdquo;<br>Lu Yingzhou&rsquo;s behavior angered many people.<br>The Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain&rsquo;s headmaster was even mocking the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster with a gloomy expression.<br>That said, compared to the others, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had a deep gaze.<br>He knew Lu Yingzhou very well, and knew what sort of person he was. He felt that Lu Yingzhou would not behave in such a low and petty manner without cause.<br>Likely, he had his own plans.<br>Sure enough, after Chu Feng accepted the armor and put it on, the corners of Lu Yingzhou&rsquo;s mouth rose to a very faint and practically undetectable smile.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after he smiled, Chu Feng, who originally had his back to Lu Yingzhou, suddenly turned around and faced him head-on.<br>Furthermore, his gaze was extremely cold.<br>At that instant, Lu Yingzhou felt as if he were about to suffocate.<br>In a panic, he actually fell to his knees with a &lsquo;putt.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Elder Lu, you&rsquo;re capable of adapting to circumstances.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How about you start following me from now on? I can put you in a good position. Of course, you&rsquo;ll receive much better treatment from me than the All-heaven Sect.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng laughed mockingly and soared into the sky.<br>Insult. Chu Feng&rsquo;s words were naturally meant to insult Lu Yingzhou.<br>However, being insulted by Chu Feng, Lu Yingzhou did not show any trace of anger. Instead, after Chu Feng flew away, he actually heaved a sigh of relief.<br>The instant he saw that chilly gaze earlier, he was so scared that he was covered in cold sweat.<br>Perhaps others were unable to understand why he suddenly knelt before Chu Feng.<br>But he himself knew very well. He had harbored an ulterior motive.<br>To see such a chilly gaze with an ulterior motive in his heart, he had thought that his scheme was seen through by Chu Feng.<br>It was only later that he discovered Chu Feng was only planning to insult him. Because of that, he heaved a sigh of relief.<br>&ldquo;Brat, go ahead and continue with your arrogance. You&rsquo;ll soon be crying.&rdquo;<br>A sinister cold smile once again rose on Lu Yingzhou&rsquo;s face as he said those words.<br>Then, he subconsciously looked to his body. He opened his palm, and a concealed power covered his body.<br>Of course, he was the only person who could see this concealed power. The others were simply unable to see it.<br>Through his control, the concealed power that covered his palm began to dissipate.<br>When the concealed power disappeared, his actual palm appeared.<br>His actual palm was actually charred black. Furthermore, there was purple lightning running through it.<br>The purple lightning was like countless purple needles shuttling through his palm.<br>In truth, it was not only his palm that was like that, the great majority of his body had been eroded in such a manner.<br>The reason why he was in such a state was because of his previous attempt to enter the sea of purple lightning.<br>After being eroded, his body became extremely weak.<br>However, for the sake of deceiving Chu Feng, he not only resisted his pain, but he even used the concealed power to disguise himself to make it seem like he was fine.<br>He did all this so that Chu Feng would come in contact with the sea of lightning too.<br>Should he come in contact with the sea of lightning, he would suffer the same as him. Perhaps he might even suffer more severely.<br>After all, the speed with which Chu Feng entered the sea of lightning was even faster than his.<br>Of course, no one was paying attention to Lu Yingzhou.<br>No one noticed the current facial expression he had. No one knew what he was scheming.<br>Everyone&rsquo;s gaze was focused on Chu Feng.<br>They all wanted to see whether Chu Feng would succeed in passing through the sea of lightning that even Lu Yingzhou failed to pass through.<br>Of course, they were all hoping for his failure.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~~&rdquo;<br>Finally, Chu Feng arrived at the sea of lightning.<br>Compared to Lu Yingzhou, who immediately started screaming the moment he came in contact with the lightning, unable to enter at all, Chu Feng reacted completely differently.<br>A portion of his body had managed to enter the sea of lightning.<br></p></div>
