        <h1>Chapter 2778</h1>
        <div> - Li Xiang In Trouble<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Afterwards, Chu Feng continued onward. Soon, he encountered another purple tree. He approached it and sure enough, a large quantity of flying insects flew out from the purple tree. The amount of flying insects this time around was even greater than last time. A rough estimate would be over a thousand flying insects.<br>Chu Feng was overjoyed upon seeing this. He directly tossed forth the spirit formation he held in his hand. Once his spirit formation was tossed out, it started to emit enormous suction power.<br>Although those flying insects appeared to be extremely fierce, and would cause anyone below the True Immortal level of cultivation to suffer upon encountering them, they were powerless to retaliate before Chu Feng, and could only allow themselves to be controlled.<br>With the enormous suction power, the group of flying insects seemed to have fallen into an invisible cage. In the end, they were all sucked into Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation.<br>After those insects were captured in his spirit formation, Chu Feng immediately retrieved the spirit formation and began to carefully inspect the situation inside.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, the two of us might&rsquo;ve really guessed correctly. These flying insects are the key to entering Buried Spirit Lake,&rdquo; Chu Feng became wild with joy.<br>The reason for that was because after those newly captured flying insects entered the spirit formation, not only did they not clash with the flying insects already inside the spirit formation, but they also started gathering with the flying insects inside.<br>Furthermore, after they gathered together, they also started to change. As for the change, it was a bit more evident compared to the last group of flying insects. Although it was only a bit more evident, it was still captured by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Quickly, go and capture more. You must capture enough flying insects in a day&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You must try your best to enter Buried Spirit Lake before its eruption,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen urged.<br>&ldquo;As you command, Milady Queen,&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed mischievously. Then, he continued to search for more flying insects.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s mood was extremely good at that moment. He felt that he had finally found the right path to follow.<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng began to roam about the vast mountain. There was only a single goal in his mind - capture a sufficient amount of flying insects.<br>Of course, Chu Feng was not only capturing the flying sects. He also gathered the purple gemstones.<br>Even though Chu Feng was unable to tell what use those purple gems possessed, he was also unable to ascertain that they were useless. Thus, it would be better that he gather them too.<br>Chu Feng would occasionally encounter other people on the mountain. Those people were all roaming around aimlessly. They simply did not even have the slightest clue as to what to do.<br>When they encountered Chu Feng, they all reacted as if they had found their savior, and wanted to follow Chu Feng so that he could bring them to Buried Spirit Lake.<br>However, although Chu Feng was a kindhearted individual, he was not someone who would help anyone and everyone.<br>Furthermore, there was no relationship between those people and him. Thus, there was simply no reason for Chu Feng to help them.<br>Thus, Chu Feng would always shake off those people without bothering to even pay attention to them.<br>However, there were also exceptions. Those were the people from the Immortal Armament Villa and the Sacred Pellet Villa.<br>There was no need to mention the people from the Immortal Armament Villa. The reason why Chu Feng was able to participate was all thanks to the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master. Thus, Chu Feng felt that he should help the disciples of the Immortal Armament Villa should he encounter them.<br>As for the Sacred Pellet Villa, it was purely because Chu Feng had a pretty decent impression of them.<br>Even though the first impression Li Xiang and his two buddies gave Chu Feng was very bad, Chu Feng&rsquo;s impression of them had improved a lot after experiencing things with them.<br>This was especially true for Li Xiang. After he exploded in rage, he actually ruthlessly slapped Yuwen Hualong.<br>Chu Feng felt that Li Xiang was very brave. Thus, he started to think highly of him.<br>In the blink of an eye, over half a day passed. Chu Feng was feeling more joyous, and also more nervous. The reason for that was because he was about to gather the amount of flying insects he needed according to the series of numbers.<br>This was the reason why Chu Feng was both joyful and nervous. He was joyful because he would soon reach the goal that he had worked so hard for.<br>He was nervous because he was worried that he might discover upon gathering the required amount of flying insects that it was just a red herring played by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan. He was worried that the flying insects were simply not the key to Buried Spirit Lake. If that was the case, all of Chu Feng&rsquo;s effort would be in vain.<br>That said, regardless, Chu Feng must still gather the required amount of flying insects first.<br>Chu Feng had encountered quite a few people on his journey so far.<br>He had even run into Li Xiang&rsquo;s two buddies.<br>However, he had yet to encounter Li Xiang himself.<br>From Li Xiang&rsquo;s two buddies, Chu Feng came to find out that the three of them had followed after Chu Feng and entered the same beam of light.<br>Thus, it was due to the beam of light that the three of them were unable to appear at the same location.<br>That being said, Chu Feng had no idea that there was actually another reason why he did not encounter Li Xiang.<br>The reason for that was because even though other people were walking about aimlessly in the mountain, they had expanded their range. As such, it was easier for them to encounter others on the mountain.<br>However, the stubborn Li Xiang had decided to follow a mountain path he had discovered the entire time. Thus, he had actually been moving about in circles, unable to make progress.<br>This greatly reduced the chance of him encountering others.<br>&ldquo;Fuck! What the hell is this? I have walked for so long, yet I still haven&rsquo;t reached Buried Spirit Lake?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only that, but I actually didn&rsquo;t manage to encounter a single person.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens, please don&rsquo;t let me down. Don&rsquo;t betray the hopes of a dedicated individual like myself.&rdquo;<br>Li Xiang continued to walk down the same path while muttering to himself.<br>Actually, he had also thought that the mountain path he was on might be a trick to confuse him. However, apart from this mountain path, he had not discovered anything that could lead him to Buried Spirit Lake.<br>As for the clue that he had obtained from his glass ball, he felt it to simply be a scam. The reason for that was because the clue was simply too vague.<br>Thus, even though Li Xiang knew that following the mountain path was incorrect, he still insisted on doing so. He felt that he might be able to actually reach Buried Spirit Lake should he continue to walk down the mountain path.<br>He knew that this was a very foolish method, a method that relied completely on luck.<br>However, apart from this, Li Xiang was unable to think of any other method to reach Buried Spirit Lake.<br>&ldquo;Truly a fool.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually really someone who continued to follow this mountain path the entire time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am truly unable to imagine how someone like you managed to continue to live for so long.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a mocking voice sounded from the nearby forest.<br>Li Xiang was immediately furious upon hearing this voice. He turned his gaze around and planned to argue with the person who had called him a fool.<br>However, after he saw who the individual that mocked him was, his expression changed immediately. Without uttering another word, he turned around and started fleeing.<br>The reason for that was because that person was one of the two people that Li Xiang did not wish to encounter the most.<br>That person was Yuwen Tingyi.<br>&ldquo;Trying to flee?&rdquo;<br>Yuwen Tingyi&rsquo;s expression turned sinister. He waved his sleeve and immediately brought forth a violent wind. With his sleeve as the center, the violent wind formed a vortex.<br>Li Xiang was caught in the vortex. Like a loose kite, Li Xiang was blown left and right inside. When he landed on the ground, he was already dizzy, his vision blurred and his complexion pale. He was unable to even stand up.<br>Li Xiang was kneeling on the ground and vomiting blood nonstop.<br>&ldquo;What are you planning to do? I am a disciple of the Sacred Pellet Villa. If you dare touch me, our Sacred Pellet Villa will definitely not spare you,&rdquo; Li Xiang said with his weak voice.<br>He knew that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan never concerned themselves with personal conflicts that might occur among the guests that arrived at that place.<br>Thus, if Li Xiang wanted to protect himself, he could only bring up the Sacred Pellet Villa.<br>That being said, Li Xiang was still very scared. After all, he had heard rumors that Yuwen Tingyi and Yuwen Hualong were deranged individuals. The two of them were completely undisciplined and out of control. They were very well-known to be vicious and fierce.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Scared? What happened to your arrogance earlier?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why weren&rsquo;t you scared when you slapped my brother Hualong ten thousand times?&rdquo; Yuwen Tingyi walked over to Li Xiang. He had a smile on his face. However, that smile was extremely frightening. Li Xiang was shaking nonstop from fear.<br>Yuwen Tingyi was looking at Li Xiang with an extremely ice-cold gaze. Killing intent was present within his eyes.<br>&ldquo;That is because he lost to Chu Feng in their bet. Those slaps are what he deserved. I merely did what I needed to do,&rdquo; Li Xiang said.<br>&ldquo;Bullshit!&rdquo; Yuwen Tingyi was furious. As he spoke, a slap was sent forth.<br>&ldquo;Paa!&rdquo; His slap landed on Li Xiang&rsquo;s face.<br>When that slap landed, Li Xiang was sent flying several meters away. When he landed, his face was completely deformed. Blood was flowing from his mutilated face unceasingly.<br>However, Yuwen Tingyi did not have any intention of stopping. He walked over to Li Xiang and raised his hand once more. He planned to slap Li Xiang again.<br>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice suddenly exploded from afar.<br>Turning toward the voice, it was actually a disciple from the Immortal Armament Villa. Judging from his appearance, he should have been wandering around the mountain and arrived there by chance to encounter what was happening.<br>&ldquo;Yuwen Tingyi, what are you doing? Do not mess around.&rdquo;<br>That Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s disciple could be said to be quite courageous. Not only did he not flee after seeing what was happening, but he instead stood forth with the intention to stop Yuwen Tingyi.<br>&ldquo;Scram!&rdquo; Yuwen Tingyi waved his sleeve, and a strong burst of wind swept forth. That Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s disciple was unable to avoid the wind at all, and was knocked several meters away.<br>&ldquo;Utter another word and I&rsquo;ll kill you too,&rdquo; Yuwen Tingyi spoke fiercely.<br>After hearing those words, that Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s disciple no longer tried to stick around. Instead, he got back to his feet with difficulty and hurriedly ran toward the direction he came from.<br>At that moment, Yuwen Tingyi turned his gaze to Li Xiang again. Viciousness filled his gaze.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared, I will not kill you immediately.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will have you properly experience what it means to be in so much pain that you&rsquo;ll wish you were dead.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is the consequence of going against us.&rdquo;<br>Yuwen Tingyi looked to Li Xiang and spoke with a perverted tone.<br><br><br>Check out the June Giveaway for a chance to win $200, $100 or $50 Visa Gift Card<br><br><br></p></div>
