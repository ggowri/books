        <div><span>: Invitation from the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;How strong is Ling Xiao then?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t reveal that. You&rsquo;ll know in due time,&rdquo; Jie Yu replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Tsk. What&rsquo;s there to hide about this? I mean, he&rsquo;s either at Royal Dragon God-cloak or Immortal God-cloak, right? Besides, he went to the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith, didn&rsquo;t he? We&rsquo;ll know how strong he is very soon anyway,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>Ignoring Bai Yunqing, Jie Yu turned to Chu Feng and passed a communication talisman to Chu Feng as he said, &ldquo;Rest well, Chu Feng. Feel free to call me if you need anything. I&rsquo;ll be taking my leave now.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng accepted the communication talisman, but he couldn&rsquo;t help but ask, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you mention that there are things you would like to verify?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that anymore. I already have my answer. You&rsquo;re the real deal. I shouldn&rsquo;t have jumped to conclusions that quickly,&rdquo; Jie Yu replied before taking his leave.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, it looks like you have won that fellow over. Look at how his attitude has changed. Not a trace of his past arrogance at all,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He was conceited, but at least he had principles. What do you think?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. There are only two people I trust in the world. One is my master, and the other one is you,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You mentioned the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith earlier. What is that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you can think of the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith as a place similar to the Ancient Realm. It has a long history behind it, and it is often drifting around the land, making it impossible to pinpoint its location. However, the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith is much more famous than the Ancient Realm.</span><br><span>&ldquo;First and foremost, the ruler of the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith, Master Nine Zenith, is a powerful individual who is well-versed in both cultivation and formations. In fact, there are rumors that he is on par with the galaxy overlords.</span><br><span>There is a humongous formation spanning the entire Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith, and the formation is known as the Heavens Ranking. As soon as the Heavens Ranking opens, it&rsquo;ll be visible to everyone in the world of cultivation. You&rsquo;re a world spiritist yourself, so can you imagine just how powerful must one be in order to pull that off?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.</span><br><span>Chu Feng could hardly imagine just how much spirit power it would take in order to </span><span>make something visible to the entire world of cultivation, especially considering how huge the universe was.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith would periodically send out invitations, and those who received an invitation would usually participate in the event. Do you know why?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith only invites the strongest juniors out in the world of cultivation. Not every single generation of juniors has received an invitation; that in itself should tell you how strict the criteria are. Just receiving an invitation in itself is proof that an individual is a huge deal in the current era.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Let me put it this way. The last time the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith sent out an invitation was in Lord Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s era. Since then, no one has been invited to the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith till now. In fact, Lord Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s generation was the first time in a long while anyone has been invited to the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith. Furthermore, I heard that the invitations this time around are different from usual,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I heard that the last time the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith opened, the other powers paid a visit to Master Nine Zenith to request that their prodigies be allowed to compete on the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith. It was out of respect for those powers that Master Nine Zenith issued the invitations. This time around, Master Nine Zenith did it on his own accord,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that not even the juniors in Lord Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s era were enough for Master Nine Zenith to send out invitations? In other words, the juniors of the current era are much stronger?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You can take it that way, but that&rsquo;s only to be expected. Lord Jie Ranqing was indeed powerful, but none of the prodigies that shared her era are close to her level. On the other hand, we&rsquo;re currently in the God&rsquo;s Era. There are simply too many outstanding juniors out there. Someone of my strength could have easily been the strongest junior back then, but in the current era, I&rsquo;m nowhere close at all,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;In other words, those who have been invited to Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith will have a fight there to decide who is the strongest, then the Heavens Rankboard will announce the result to the entire world of cultivation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s basically a tournament for juniors. All of the top prodigies have been invited, including the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Ling Xiao. The result should be out very soon. By then, we&rsquo;ll get to witness the legendary Heavens Rankboard with our own eyes. You should know that the Heavens Rankboard didn&rsquo;t even trigger back in Lord Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s era!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>Those words revealed that the tournament conducted at the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith back in Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s era wasn&rsquo;t an official one, which explained why the result wasn&rsquo;t announced by the Heavens Rankboard.</span><br><span>Things were different this time around. The tournament was conducted under the free will of the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith, so the legendary Heavens Rankboard that was said to be able to reach the entire world of cultivation would make an appearance once more.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It sure is a pity that the Nine Heavens&rsquo; Zenith isn&rsquo;t an open competition. I would have loved to watch Xianhai Shaoyu in action!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing remarked.</span><br><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s interest was piqued upon hearing Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;Who do you think will win the tournament?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s Xianhai Shaoyu! He&rsquo;s known to be the strongest prodigy of the Nine Galaxies! Not even our Totem Galaxy&rsquo;s Long Chengyu can put up a fight against him! You can even say that he&rsquo;s the Jie Ranqing of our era&hellip; though his younger sister, Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er, seems to be even more talented, given how she had left her name in the Immemorial Star Sea.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that the world doesn&rsquo;t know that our big brother Chu Feng is a rising star from the fallen Ancestral Martial Galaxy. I look forward to the day when people learn about what you are capable of!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said with an expectant look on his face.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a place in God&rsquo;s Era too,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That goes without saying. I might not be in the highest echelon, but I shouldn&rsquo;t appear too shabby lest I embarrass you,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should call me big brother. We&rsquo;re good brothers; there shouldn&rsquo;t be any hierarchy between us,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do. I&rsquo;ve already acknowledged you as my big brother!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh well. I guess I have no choice but to work even harder. I&rsquo;d become a laughingstock if I, as the big brother, am unable to protect my little brother,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Hahaha! Let&rsquo;s work hard together!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>Meanwhile, Jie Yu had entered a palace, where the old woman and a black-haired middle-aged woman were waiting for him. The black-haired middle-aged woman was none other than Lord Shuang Yu.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is that for real? Did Chu Feng really manage to claim the Life Crystal inside the trial?&rdquo; Jie Yu asked in astonishment.</span><br><span>Lord Shuang Yu had her doubts when she learned about the result of the trial. She couldn&rsquo;t understand how Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing could walk out unscathed from that entrance and even nourish a crystal of that tier. She tried to investigate the matter through her means, and that was when she noticed that the Life Crystal inside the trial had vanished.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be certain whether they are the ones who took it, but the Life Crystal can&rsquo;t possibly disappear for no reason. It&rsquo;s probably their doing,&rdquo; Lord Shuang Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It must be Chu Feng then, Lord Shuang Yu. I just witnessed Chu Feng awakening the Life Crystal I have lost to him with my own eyes! He&rsquo;s an extraordinary world spiritist. I don&rsquo;t think that there is anyone in our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion who can rival him,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master Jie Yu, what nonsense are you spouting?&rdquo; Lord Shuang Yu&rsquo;s face turned cold.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Shuang Yu, there&rsquo;s no doubt that Chu Feng is an extremely powerful individual. Even though he isn&rsquo;t from our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, we ought to acknowledge his strength. In fact, I hope to have him accompany me to the Ancient Palace,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>Lord Shuang Yu&rsquo;s face darkened. &ldquo;Young master Jie Yu, are you out of your mind? How can an outsider be allowed to accompany you into the Ancient Palace?&rdquo;</span><br><span>However, Jie Yu remained adamant about his stance. &ldquo;Lord Shuang Yu, I need his help. I hope that you can accede to my request.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do. Even if I permit it, young miss Ling Mo&rsquo;er and young master Jie Zhou won&rsquo;t accept it. Unless you&rsquo;re able to convince them, I&rsquo;m afraid that I can&rsquo;t call the shots on this,&rdquo; Lord Shuang Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Shuang Yu, can&rsquo;t you think of a way to pull it off?&rdquo; Jie Yu asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I already told you that it&rsquo;s against the rules. If you really want Chu Feng to accompany you, you should personally negotiate with young miss Ling Mo&rsquo;er and young master Jie Zhou by yourself. If they are fine with it, I&rsquo;ll turn a blind eye to this matter,&rdquo; Lord Shuang Yu said.</span><br><span>Jie Yu frowned. He dared not to mess with Ling Mo&rsquo;er and Jie Zhou.</span><br></p></div>
