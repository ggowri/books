        <h1>Chapter 4115</h1>
        <div> - Fumo Shaoyu<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For the rest of their journey, apart from the change in Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s attitude toward Chu Feng, the two of them did not encounter any other trouble.<br>Instead, their journey was exceptionally smooth.<br>Not only did they arrive at the Netherworld Ice Hall without a hitch, but they also managed to find the location where Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s big brother was imprisoned without encountering any problems.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s older brother had failed to rescue Little Fishy, and been thrown into a death prison by the people from the Netherworld Ice Hall.<br>That death prison was actually a vicious grand formation.<br>Those imprisoned in the death formation would slowly be refined by it.<br>Not only would they die in pain, but they would also be turned into cultivation resources for the Netherworld Ice Hall.<br>However, one thing worthy of mentioning was the fact that the death prison was not tightly guarded.<br>With Chu Feng&rsquo;s abilities, he easily snuck inside.<br>Whilst there were some guards outside the death prison, there were no guards inside. The grand formation was the only thing inside.<br>As such, Chu Feng finally managed to meet Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s big brother.<br>Like Fumo Xin&rsquo;er, her big brother&rsquo;s appearance would be ranked as that of a dragon among men.<br>In simpler terms, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s big brother was extremely handsome. He even emitted the extraordinary air of a ruler.<br>Merely by looking at him, one would think that the man was extraordinary and would definitely accomplish great things in the future.<br>Ignoring his cultivation, merely his appearance would be enough to charm countless women.<br>However, in the world of cultivators, strength was the most important.<br>Women were all fond of powerful men. For them, one&rsquo;s appearance did not have too much appeal.<br>The only exception would be men that were especially handsome.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s big brother was evidently one such man. He was a man who could charm women with merely his appearance.<br>There were a lot of people imprisoned in this death prison. However, the majority of them were already dead. They had been reduced to bones with their source energies sucked dry.<br>Only a dozen or so people were still alive in the death prison.<br>They were all enduring the torment of the death prison. The great majority of them had lost consciousness. Yet, they were still letting out painful moans and screams.<br>However, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s big brother was an exception.<br>Even though he was clearly inside the death prison and enveloped by the power of the spirit formation, he was acting like he was completely unaffected.<br>Not only was he sitting in a corner of the prison, but he was actually reading a book with his head lowered.<br>He was completely immersed in his reading, so much so that he didn&rsquo;t even hear Fumo Xin&rsquo;er when she called for him.<br>This sort of situation made Fumo Xin&rsquo;er extremely anxious.<br>After all, even if there wasn&rsquo;t anyone guarding the inside of the death prison, there were still people guarding the outside.<br>She did not dare to shout loudly at her brother because she was afraid of alarming the guards outside.<br>As for Chu Feng, he was curious as to exactly what sort of book Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s big brother was reading to make him so entranced.<br>As such, he activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to carefully examine the book.<br>However, once he did, black lines rolled down his head.<br>That book was not a mysterious technique or martial skill. It was not a cultivation method either. It was only an ordinary book.<br>There were many different types of ordinary books.<br>There were stories about powerful experts and historical biographies.<br>In short, the majority of them were made-up stories.<br>That said, the sort of book that Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s big brother was reading was the most unbearable sort.<br>It was a book that was unsuitable for children.<br>That said, even for those, they would mostly be about the sentiments between a man and a woman.<br>But, the one that Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s big brother was reading seemed to be about the sentiments between a man and another man. It was not a story about camaraderie between brothers. Instead, it was similar to the feelings between a man and a woman.<br>This was the first time that Chu Feng had caught sight of such reading material.<br>Seeing it, he immediately felt goose bumps all over his body. He was extremely uncomfortable.<br>When he looked at Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s brother again and saw how handsome, confident and extraordinary he looked, a word suddenly appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind - freak.<br>&ldquo;What are we to do? This happens every time my brother is immersed in a book. He&rsquo;s especially concentrated when he reads books. Unless one is to shout at him loudly, he will not be able to hear you at all,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er said to Chu Feng quietly.<br>&ldquo;Are you stupid?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you not know how to send him a voice transmission?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng rolled his eyes at Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s true!&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er came to a sudden realization.<br>Then, she did as Chu Feng had suggested.<br>Whilst voice transmissions could only be heard by the people they were meant for, the sound of the voices differed according to one&rsquo;s will.<br>As such, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er must have used an extremely loud voice to call for her brother.<br>Because of that, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s brother, who had been immersed in reading, actually let out a scream of alarm.<br>&ldquo;My dear sister, you&rsquo;ve finally come.&rdquo;<br>Upon discovering that it was his little sister that came, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s brother was immediately wild with joy, and actually started leaping around like a child. He jumped to the edge of the death prison.<br>&ldquo;Eh? Where&rsquo;s grandma? Did grandma not come?&rdquo;<br>However, his expression soon changed to one of seriousness.<br>Evidently, he knew that it was useless for Fumo Xin&rsquo;er to come alone.<br>She was incapable of rescuing him.<br>&ldquo;Grandma said that you brought this upon yourself, and that she would not save you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However big brother, you don&rsquo;t have to worry. I&rsquo;ve found someone else to help you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He is also a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist. He&rsquo;ll be able to rescue you,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er pointed to Chu Feng standing beside her.<br>&ldquo;Him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s big brother gave Chu Feng a measuring glance.<br>Contempt and suspicion was clearly visible in his gaze.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s that person I mentioned to you before, the person from inside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast&rsquo;s stomach,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;So he&rsquo;s that dumbass?&rdquo;<br>Upon learning of Chu Feng&rsquo;s origin, the contempt in Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s eyes as he looked at Chu Feng grew even more intense.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng opened his palm, and a body of light floated out.<br>Then, that body of light landed on the death prison&rsquo;s wall.<br>With that, the wall started to melt away. Soon an exit appeared in the wall.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s big brother immediately walked out of the exit.<br>To his surprise, he'd actually managed to walk out from the death prison so easily.<br>&ldquo;Dang! As expected of someone who'd been devoured by an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast. You are truly a genius among geniuses.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother, the way I see it,l your world spirit techniques are no weaker than my grandma&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s big brother&rsquo;s attitude took a one-eighty degree change right away. Even the gaze with which he looked at Chu Feng had changed enormously.<br>Earlier, his eyes had been filled with contempt. However, tiny stars had begun flickering in his eyes afterwards.<br>That sort of idolizing gaze was something Chu Feng had only seen in women&rsquo;s eyes before.<br>Now that a man was looking at him in such a manner, he felt extremely uncomfortable.<br>&ldquo;Brother, my name is Fumo Shaoyu. May I know how to address you?&rdquo; Fumo Shaoyu said to Chu Feng with a clasped fist.<br>His current attitude was truly a heaven and earth difference from before.<br>&ldquo;I am Chu Feng. It is my pleasure to meet brother Shaoyu,&rdquo; Chu Feng returned the clasped fist.<br>&ldquo;Likewise, likewise. Brother Chu Feng, these people have all suffered too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is it possible to rescue them too?&rdquo;<br>Fumo Shaoyu pointed to the people being tortured by the spirit formation inside the death prison.<br>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, brother Shaoyu, do you know where Little Fishy is imprisoned?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Ever since Chu Feng had entered the Netherworld Ice Hall, he had been carefully observing his surroundings with the intention of finding the whereabouts of Little Fishy.<br>However, there were simply too many layers of spirit formations in there. Those spirit formations seriously affected his perception ability.<br>As such, he had not managed to find Little Fishy&rsquo;s whereabouts.<br>&ldquo;Little Fishy?&rdquo;<br>Fumo Shaoyu was evidently surprised when he heard Chu Feng asking about Little Fishy, and he looked at Fumo Xin&rsquo;er inquiringly.<br>He was trying to get an answer from her.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, Little Fishy could very possibly be someone Chu Feng knows.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why he wants to save her,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such a thing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, that shouldn&rsquo;t be the case. Little Fishy grew up in the Heaven-devouring Realm. Brother Chu Feng is someone from the outside. How could he know Little Fishy?&rdquo;<br>Fumo Shaoyu still felt that it was very unlikely.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, do you know where Little Fishy is?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked again.<br>&ldquo;Whist I do know where she is&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s better that you give up. Little Fishy is imprisoned in the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s main hall.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;She is very possibly already dead now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if she isn&rsquo;t dead, you will still not be able to rescue her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you insist on going there, you will only be throwing away your life,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu whilst looking straight at Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
