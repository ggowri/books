        <h1>Chapter 5081</h1>
        <div>: Mysterious Silhouette<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were complicated inscriptions on the black gate that resembled an ancient formation or special characters. Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t decipher them, but he noticed that there was a formation embedded into the two doors of the gate.<br>These two formations were incomplete, but they formed one whole together. In other words, the formation would be completed when the doors to the gate were closed. It was just that Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t see through it at the moment.<br>He would have checked a little more, but sensing that something was happening outside, he quickly retracted his consciousness from his World Spirit Space. It was only then that he noticed over tens of millions of Asura World Spirits kneeling before him.<br>Of them, eight million were at Exalted Martial level and nearly a million had reached peak Martial Exalted level.<br>Even for Half-God level&mdash;a height that the Lady of Dao Sea, the Godwish Grandmother, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, and the other top experts of the Nine Souls Galaxy dreamed of reaching&mdash;there were nearly ten thousand of them.<br>The strongest one amongst them was the Asura King, who was at rank four Half-God level. Other than that, there were roughly a hundred of them at rank three Half-God level and nearly a thousand at rank two Half-God level.<br>One must know that this was after their cultivation levels had regressed. Otherwise, they would have been much more powerful.<br>What was worth noting was that Lord Yunliang, who had his cultivation crippled, had regained his cultivation under the effect of God&rsquo;s Contract. His current cultivation was at rank three Half-God level.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, please rise. I&rsquo;ll make sure that you won&rsquo;t regret the choice you have made today!&rdquo; Chu Feng declared.<br>The Asura World Spirits finally rose to their feet.<br>&ldquo;Daddy, why can&rsquo;t I establish a contract with you?&rdquo; Yaoyao looked at Chu Feng begrudgingly as she asked.<br>&ldquo;Yaoyao wants to contract with me too?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Yup yup! I want to be with daddy, but I don&rsquo;t know how to do the contract,&rdquo; Yaoyao replied with a pout.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng. I taught Brightmoon&mdash;no no no, I mean Yaoyao&mdash;how to establish a contract with you earlier, but it didn&rsquo;t work. My guess is that Yaoyao is unable to contract with you due to her special origins,&rdquo; the Asura King replied.<br>&ldquo;Yaoyao is indeed an unusual existence. She isn&rsquo;t an Asura Evil Spirit, and it&rsquo;s impossible to tell whether she&rsquo;s a world spirit or not. She seems more like a normal human than anything, being able to live in the world of cultivation without any restrictions,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>He turned to Yaoyao, patted her little head, and said, &ldquo;Yaoyao, you don&rsquo;t have to make a contract with you. You&rsquo;re already irreplaceable in my heart.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hehehe!&rdquo;<br>Yaoyao revealed a sweet smile.<br>The Asura King was heartened to see Yaoyao&rsquo;s smile. He knew that he had done many bad things to Yaoyao&mdash;he had sacrificed Yaoyao&rsquo;s mother in order to help Yaoyao acquire power&mdash;and the truth was that he had been blaming himself for it.<br>He would have nothing to say even if Yaoyao chose not to forgive him for life, but he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel bitter about it since she was his flesh and blood, after all. That was why he was glad to see that Yaoyao had found someone to rely on, and that person happened to be the master chosen by the Asura World Spirit Army. It was such a coincidence that he thought that it might have been heaven&rsquo;s will.<br>Weng!<br>The contract formation suddenly disappeared at this moment. It left Chu Feng feeling conflicted as the immense power harnessed within God&rsquo;s Contract had vanished along with it. It was likely to be gone for good.<br>However, he could sense that the construction inside his World Spirit Space had been completed. With a thought, he summoned the ten thousand meters tall black formation gate in front of him.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, I have come here to request your help. I have encountered a difficult opponent, but I believe that I&rsquo;ll be able to defeat them with your strength. Thus, I ask you to follow me to battle,&rdquo; Chu Feng told the Asura World Spirit Army.<br>Grar!<br>&ldquo;Fight for Lord Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fight for Lord Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Show them the prowess of our Asura World Spirit Army!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Goddamnit! I&rsquo;ll massacre anyone who dares to mess with our lord!&rdquo;<br>Deafening cheers resounded in the Asura King Palace, making their enthusiasm known. Amidst their cheers, they quickly made their way into the black formation gate.<br>However, the Asura King didn&rsquo;t enter the formation gate right away. Instead, he made his way to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side and took out a black compass. The compass resembled an elliptical rock, but it was clearly a treasure and had a powerful formation embedded within it.<br>The compass used to harness formidable energy, but the energy was on the verge of drying up.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?&rdquo; Lord Yunliang exclaimed in astonishment upon seeing the compass.<br>The other Asura World Spirits who noticed the compass also halted their footsteps to stare at it. Some of the Asura World Spirits who had already entered the black formation gate even flew back out.<br>It was clear that this compass held great significance to them.<br>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the Asura King.<br>&ldquo;This is a treasure from Lord Massacre. It&rsquo;s thanks to its nourishment that we were able to survive here for so long and advance our cultivation. However, the energy it contains isn&rsquo;t limitless. I only disobeyed Lord Massacre and sought another way out of the Asura Graveyard because this treasure is about to run out of energy.<br>&ldquo;If the energy within this compass dries up before we find a new master, it wouldn&rsquo;t be long before we breathe our last here. Now that we have found ourselves a new master, I shouldn&rsquo;t be the one holding onto this treasure anymore.<br>&ldquo;Lord Chu Feng, please.&rdquo;<br>The Asura King handed the compass over to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng sensed that the compass was intricately linked to all of the Asura World Spirits present, but he could only sense the power it harnessed and not its true nature. Be it this compass, God&rsquo;s Contract, or the changes that had happened to his World Spirit Space, they were all powers beyond his understanding.<br>And these were things that the Emperor of Massacre had left on a whim tens of thousands of years ago.<br>If the Emperor of Massacre was still alive in this age, it was hard to imagine just how powerful he would be.<br>&ldquo;Milord, doesn&rsquo;t that mean that it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before we die here if we had chosen not to contract with Lord Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>A few of the Asura World Spirits asked the Asura King.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. That&rsquo;s also the reason I didn&rsquo;t tell you about this. I wanted to know how many of you earnestly wish to pledge your loyalty to Lord Chu Feng, and I am heartened by the result. None of you have chosen Lord Chu Feng out of fear of death,&rdquo; the Asura King said.<br>Shortly later, he added, &ldquo;From this day onward, don&rsquo;t call me your king anymore. Just Kui Ting will suffice. We only have one king now, and that&rsquo;s Lord Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>The Asura King then turned his eyes to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Lord Kui Ting, am I your master now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course, Lord Chu Feng,&rdquo; the Asura King quickly replied.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, I order you to continue being the Asura King. You shall be the one to command the Asura World Spirit Army,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>The Asura King was taken aback, but he quickly fell to the floor and bowed deeply.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m flattered by Milord's trust in me! I, Kui Ting, will definitely not let you down!&rdquo; the Asura King cried out.<br>The Asura World Spirit Army quickly entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s World Spirit Space afterward. Chu Feng was intending to have the Asura King stay behind and bring him around. That would have made traveling much faster.<br>However, the Asura King replied that he was now an Asura World Spirit and could lend his powers to Chu Feng any time, even when he was within the World Spirit Space.<br>That reminded Chu Feng of how he had borrowed Eggy&rsquo;s power to dominate the Nine Provinces Continent back when he was still in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. For a moment there, he felt like he had returned to his younger years.<br>So, he accepted the Asura King&rsquo;s proposal. He decided to not have the Asura King directly help him but instead to borrow the Asura King&rsquo;s power and settle everything himself.<br>Weng!<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes suddenly turned pitch-black, and he began releasing black gaseous flames. His current appearance looked just like an Asura World Spirit. He was now harnessing the power of a rank four Half-God level cultivator.<br>&ldquo;So this is a Half-God level cultivator&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Despite being a rank eight Martial Exalted level cultivator himself, he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel how insignificant Martial Exalted level cultivators were now that he was harnessing the power of the Asura King. The current him was unprecedentedly strong.<br>&ldquo;Pill Dao Immortal Sect and Sima Xiangtu. I&rsquo;ll see who dares to undermine me this time around!&rdquo;<br>Boom!<br>There was a burst of black gaseous flames, and Chu Feng vanished from the Asura Graveyard. He was already on his way to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>With his departure, the previously noisy Asura Graveyard became deathly silent. However, shortly after he left, there was a spatial distortion in the Asura King Palace, and a silhouette came into appearance.<br></p></div>
