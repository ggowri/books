        <div> - Undoing The Grand Formation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Haha, it seems that you&rsquo;re mistaken.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Prophet is truly a grandmaster indeed. The result of Grandmaster Prophet&rsquo;s prophecy is not something that you can question.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, many people began to mock the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother.<br>&ldquo;Naturally, Grandmaster Prophet&rsquo;s prophecy will be accurate. Merely, I still do not believe that, that little piece of trash Chu Feng will be able to obtain Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s inheritance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With his strength, he will not even be able to reach this place. Thus, how could he possibly obtain Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s inheritance?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you trying say that Grandmaster Kai Hong will suddenly appear and personally present his inheritance to Chu Feng?&rdquo; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said.<br>&ldquo;That is somewhat reasonable too. Although Grandmaster&rsquo;s prophecy is very accurate, it remains that Chu Feng is a member of the younger generation. Even if he is able to cause changes to the remnants, it will likely remain very difficult for him to obtain benefits before us,&rdquo; The crowd echoed.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. At times like this, what is being tested is one&rsquo;s strength.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those who are capable will be able to gain benefits.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a peak Martial Ancestor-level expert hefted a giant Ancestral Armament axe. He unleashed a movement martial skill, and began to fly toward that coffin. He planned to use that axe to split open the coffin.<br>&ldquo;You wish to be the first? Not so easy!!!&rdquo;<br>In response, the other peak Martial Ancestor-level experts rushed forth and unleashed their respective abilities. They all wanted to be the first to split open that coffin and obtain the so-called Gate Opening Key.<br>At that moment, various powerful abilities were unleashed together. They all attacked at that coffin.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before the many and various powerful attacks could approach the coffin, they were all blocked by the grand formation.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd was stunned.<br>The people who had attacked earlier were all peak Martial Ancestor-level experts. They were actual rank nine Martial Ancestors, existences a step away from becoming True Immortals.<br>Furthermore, for the sake of being the first to obtain the Gate Opening Key from the coffin, none of them had spared any effort in their attacks. Not only had all of them attacked with overwhelming Ancestral-level might, they had also attacked with Emperor Taboo Martial Skills from the very start.<br>Those attacks were already capable of creating massive destruction in a region, and easily killing countless living things. It was pure destructive power.<br>However, it was precisely that sort of destructive power that was completely blocked by the grand defensive formation. As such, how could the many experts of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm not be astonished?<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding. Not only is that gate impossible to break through, even this spirit formation is impossible to breach.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if there&rsquo;s a so-called key in that spirit formation, how are we supposed to use it if we cannot open the spirit formation?&rdquo;<br>After their series of attacks at the spirit formation turned out to be useless, the experts present were unable to contain themselves from complaining.<br>&ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s a spirit formation, it is naturally possible to be breached. There are world spiritists among the people present, no?&rdquo; A peak Martial Ancestor from the Immortal Sword School said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. We have this many Immortal-cloak World Spiritists here, how could we possibly not be able to open that spirit formation?&rdquo; At that moment, the crowd all turned their gazes to the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors and the many other Immortal-cloak World Spiritists present.<br>It was true that there were extremely few Immortal-cloak World Spiritists in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. However, about seventy percent of all the Immortal-cloak World Spiritists were gathered here in Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s remnants.<br>Among them, nine were Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, and five were Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists.<br>[1. Quick maths. (9+5)*0.7=9.8 Total Immortal cloaks. + Chu Feng and friends = 13 Immortal cloaks.]<br>As for those world spiritists, not only were they proficient in world spirit techniques, their cultivations were also very strong.<br>&ldquo;It is fine for you all to want us to undo that spirit formation. However, after we undo the spirit formation, how are we to distribute the treasures left behind by Grandmaster Kai Hong?&rdquo; The mother of the Four World Spiritists Emperor turned to ask the crowd.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the only Immortal-cloak World Spiritist here. If you wish to help, then do it. If you do not wish to help, then move aside,&rdquo; An old man with snow-white hair placed the sharp sword he held onto his back and then began to emit spirit power to set up an unsealing formation.<br>That old man was one of the five Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists present. He was from the Immortal Sword School.<br>After that, the three Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists from the Zhou Heavenly Clan, the Kong Heavenly Clan and the Buddha&rsquo;s Heavenly Temple also joined that Immortal Sword School&rsquo;s Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. They did not wish to allow the Immortal Sword School&rsquo;s Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist to undo the spirit formation by himself and then reap the Gate Opening Key alone.<br>&ldquo;Milords, although our strength is limited, please allow us to lend you all a helping hand.&rdquo;<br>In response, the nine Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists also joined in.<br>They did not join purely because they wanted to lend a helping hand. Rather, they wanted to gain a share of the benefits in Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s remnants after undoing that spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;If you are to join us right now, you will still be able to obtain a portion of the benefits. Else, I&rsquo;m afraid Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s remnants will be unrelated to you,&rdquo; An expert from the Immortal Sword School said to the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother.<br>&ldquo;Haha, is that so?&rdquo; However, the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother smiled confidently. Then, she said, &ldquo;I dare to guarantee that if I don&rsquo;t help out, you all will absolutely not be able to open that spirit formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph, what arrogance and conceit,&rdquo; Hearing those words, that Immortal Sword School&rsquo;s expert, as well as many other people present, all scoffed at the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother.<br>However, the smile on the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother remained unchanged. Just like that, she looked on indifferently at the other world spiritists joining hands to undo the grand defensive formation.<br>At the beginning, no one cared about the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother.<br>After all, in terms of cultivation, she was unable to compare to the peak Martial Ancestors present.<br>As for world spirit techniques, even though she was a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, she was not the only Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist present here.<br>Thus, if she were to join and help out, the crowd would not stop her. However, if she refused to join and help, the crowd would not demand her assistance either.<br>However, when the undoing spirit formation the world spiritists joined hands to set up, was set up successfully, yet still did not manage to do anything to the grand defensive formation, the crowd inevitably turned their gazes to the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors.<br>In response, the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother opened her mouth and said, &ldquo;Everyone, truth be told, I once obtained a bit of Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s personal techniques from a different remnant. It is all thanks to Grandmaster Kai Hong that I managed to become a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, to a greater or lesser degree, I understand Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s spirit formations. It is useless for you all to attempt to undo the defensive formation like that.&rdquo;<br>With no alternative, the crowd asked, &ldquo;You are truly able to undo this formation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said.<br>&ldquo;Go ahead and tell us, how much do you want?&rdquo; The crowd asked.<br>&ldquo;If this remnant truly contains Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s personal techniques, I want to obtain all the personal techniques. As for treasures, I want a tenth of them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If there are no personal techniques from Grandmaster Kai Hong here, I want fifty percent of the treasures,&rdquo; The mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors said.<br>&ldquo;You are simply delusional!&rdquo; The crowd replied in unison.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing that can be done then,&rdquo; The Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother had a confident expression.<br>Just like that, many hours passed. Those world spiritists were still unable to do anything to the grand defensive formation.<br>At that moment, the people present were feeling extremely unreconciled. However, they inevitably turned their gazes to the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors again.<br>&ldquo;How about this: if you are truly able to undo this spirit formation, Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s personal techniques will be yours.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for treasures, you will not obtain any. After all, Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s personal techniques are priceless treasures themselves.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If there are none of Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s personal techniques in that remnants, you&rsquo;ll get three tenths of the treasures inside,&rdquo; After discussing it with one another, the representatives from the four tier one powers spoke in unison.<br>&ldquo;Although that proposal is not to my satisfaction, it remains that I am able to see some sincerity from you all. Very well, I shall reluctantly agree to it,&rdquo; The Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;However, if you are unable to undo that spirit formation, do not blame me for being rude,&rdquo; An expert from the Immortal Sword School said coldly.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I am most definitely capable of undoing the spirit formation,&rdquo; The Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother said confidently.<br>Then, the mother of the Four World Spiritist Emperors began to set up another grand formation before the crowd.<br>Right after she began to set up that grand formation, it immediately let out a strange aura.<br>At that moment, not to mention the others, even the eyes of those Immortal-cloak World Spiritists started to shine.<br>The reason for that was because the aura emitted by the spirit formation the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother was setting up was identical to the aura of the remnant.<br>At that moment, the crowd present all believed that the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother would be able to undo that spirit formation.<br>Sensing the admiring gazes from the crowd, the smile on the Four World Spiritist Emperors&rsquo; mother's face grew denser.<br>However, right at that moment, a voice sounded from behind the crowd like a sudden clap of thunder.<br>&ldquo;That spirit formation of yours is unable to undo that grand defensive formation.&rdquo;<br><br></p></div>
