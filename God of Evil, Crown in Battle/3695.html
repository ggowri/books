        <h1>Chapter 3694</h1>
        <div> - Bloodline Cultivation Formation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, Lingxi, the two of you stay here for now. I will leave momentarily,&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan said after exiting the interrogation hall.<br>&ldquo;Senior, do you really know the location of the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master&rsquo;s grandson?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Mn. The Blood-devouring Hall is very dangerous. They could be said to be the most dangerous power in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As they can be used by the despicable people that have concealed themselves in the dark, the Blood-devouring Hall could be said to be the most terrifying weapon in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In order to prevent the Blood-devouring Hall from attacking our Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, our clan has been investigating the weakness of the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master the entire time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I will definitely not return empty-handed,&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, I will have to trouble senior,&rdquo; Chu Feng thanked her.<br>&ldquo;As Lingxi is someone of the Chu Heavenly Clan, the matters of the Chu Heavenly Clan could be considered to be the matters of our Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, during this period of time when I&rsquo;m gone, I&rsquo;ll leave Lingxi in your care.&rdquo;<br>As Gu Mingyuan said those words, she took a profound glance at Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Who said I need him to take care of me? I can take care of myself,&rdquo; said Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan began to smile even stronger.<br>&ldquo;Aiyah! If you want to go, then go. Otherwise, those captives from the Blood-devouring Hall might really attempt to kill themselves,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said with annoyance. However, her little face had turned somewhat red.<br>&ldquo;Look at this, you&rsquo;re trying to drive me away so soon?&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan sighed dramatically. &ldquo;This is truly what it means by &lsquo;when a girl is of age, she must be married off.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What girl is of age and must be married off? You&rsquo;re simply uttering nonsense,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s face turned even redder.<br>&ldquo;Enough, enough. I&rsquo;ll leave, I&rsquo;ll leave,&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan laughed. Whilst her laughter could still be heard, she had already disappeared.<br>After Gu Mingyuan left, Chu Feng looked to Chu Lingxi. He said, &ldquo;The weather is not hot, why is your face so red?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Chu Lingxi fiercely glared at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity.&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly sighed in a very regretful manner.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a pity?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi asked.<br>&ldquo;You have such beautiful eyes, yet you insist on glaring angrily at others. It is truly a pity,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;If you still don&rsquo;t shut up, I will beat you to death,&rdquo; As Chu Lingxi spoke, she raised her fist.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, where&rsquo;s your mother?&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a figure appeared. It was Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>Seeing Chu Xuanzhengfa, Chu Feng immediately told him where Gu Mingyuan had gone.<br>After learning about this matter, Chu Xuanzhengfa was overjoyed. Originally, he had felt helpless about the situation. Never did he expect Gu Mingyuan to actually know such a secret.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa was very confident in her ability. Thus, he felt that once she returned, they would be able to force the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master to reveal the truth.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Lingxi, the two of you are both Exalted realm experts now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Bloodline Cultivation Formation should be effective for the two of you now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As you two will not be able to help with Lord Clan Chief, rather than waiting here like this, it&rsquo;s better that you enter the Bloodline Cultivation Formation to experience it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If the Bloodline Cultivation Formation ends up being helpful to you two, you should stay in there and train for some time,&rdquo; said Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please wait. I am still worried about Lord Clan Chief,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I think it&rsquo;s better that we go and check out the Bloodline Cultivation Formation. I wanted to check it out anyways. I think it&rsquo;s better if you accompany me,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said suddenly.<br>After hearing Chu Lingxi's words, Chu Feng found it difficult to refuse her.<br>In fact, he had wanted to check out the Bloodline Cultivation Formation himself. Merely, when he'd returned the last time, he had encountered the opening of the Void Sacred Tree and didn&rsquo;t have time to check it out before he had to leave again.<br>As for this time, he encountered the Blood-devouring Hall right after returning. As such, he was in no mood to check out the Bloodline Cultivation Formation.<br>However, since Chu Lingxi wanted him to accompany her, he would naturally not refuse.<br>Thus, Chu Feng and Chu Lingxi entered the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Bloodline Cultivation Formation.<br>Of course, Chu Xuanzhengfa was accompanying them.<br>&ldquo;Hey, Chu Feng, did you really open this Bloodline Cultivation Formation?&rdquo;<br>As a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan, Chu Lingxi had naturally already heard about the Bloodline Altar.<br>That said, she had also only just learned from her father of the Bloodline Altar&rsquo;s eight cultivation formations being forever open.<br>As for that, it was all due to Chu Feng.<br>One should know that not even Chu Hanxian and Chu Xuanyuan had managed to accomplish such a feat.<br>Yet, Chu Feng had accomplished it. That was the reason why she was so surprised.<br>&ldquo;It was indeed Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, I was also present.&rdquo; said Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re truly quite something. Speaking of it, if it wasn&rsquo;t for my mother&rsquo;s help, I would really not be able to catch up to you.&rdquo;<br>She sighed. &ldquo;Your talent is simply too terrifying. Likely, I will be overtaken by you sooner or later. I truly cannot afford to slack off in the slightest.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Girl, stop making such modest remarks,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled and shook his head.<br>&ldquo;I am not being modest here. I merely know my capabilities,&rdquo; said Chu Lingxi.<br>As they laughed and chatted, the three of them entered the Bloodline Cultivation Formation.<br>&ldquo;Wow! This place is so rich with natural energies.&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi immediately became excited the moment she entered.<br>She was not the only one. Chu Feng was also able to sense how overwhelmingly powerful that place was.<br>Chu Feng had actually already entered the Bloodline Cultivation Formation when it had first opened.<br>Unfortunately, the natural energies of there were practically all Exalted-level, and of no help to him.<br>As he could not gain any comprehension, he did not stay for long.<br>But now, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation had reached rank three Exalted. Entering again as an Exalted was a completely different experience.<br>That place not only contained martial comprehension and boundless martial power, it even enlivened one&rsquo;s Bloodline Power.<br>This was truly a sacred cultivation ground for those that possessed Heavenly Bloodlines.<br>To enter that place again, it would not be excessive to describe Chu Feng&rsquo;s experience as that of a fish back in water.<br>Chu Feng felt that if he were to enter closed-door training for about a year there, his cultivation would definitely increase.<br>Even by conservative measures, he felt that his cultivation would increase by two levels. Even increasing his cultivation by three levels was not impossible.<br></p></div>
