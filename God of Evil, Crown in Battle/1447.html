        <h1>Chapter 1447</h1>
        <div> - Are You Satisfied?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>The thirty-three ferocious beasts launched themselves forward to attack at Chu Feng in succession. It was extremely terrifying.<br>These thirty-three ferocious beasts bared fangs and brandished claws at Chu Feng as they snarled repeatedly. Even Chu Feng did not dare to confront them head-on.<br>With no other option, Chu Feng used a spirit technique that could increase his speed. Relying on this spirit technique, Chu Feng began to run away.<br>Thus, this scene appeared on the plaza. The thirty three ferocious beasts with sizes comparable to mountains began to use all sorts of methods to chase after a small, black-cloaked ant-like figure.<br>Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s speed was extremely fast after he used that spirit formation that increased his speed, he still appeared to be stuck in a dilemma as he was being pursued by the thirty-three ferocious beasts.<br>This scene caused all of the people from the World Spiritist Alliance to be on edge. They were truly nervous and were clenching their hands so hard that they became filled with sweat.<br>Chu Feng--no, to the people of the World Spiritist Alliance, he was Feng Chu instead of Chu Feng. Feng Chu was the final hope of the World Spiritist Alliance.<br>However, the current situation was not looking very optimistic at all. If Feng Chu was to be defeated, their World Spiritist Alliance would truly be defeated this time around.<br>However, to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, even though Chu Feng was at a disadvantage, he was able to persist. He was able to persist even in this predicament. Furthermore, his persistence lasted six entire hours.<br>Six entire hours had passed. The sun that had originally been high up in the sky was already setting in the west. Even the sky&hellip; was about to turn dark.<br>&ldquo;Truly unbelievable. Never would I have expected this Feng Chu to be able to persist for so long,&rdquo; At this moment, the people that were worried about Chu Feng losing all displayed expressions of admiration on their faces.<br>A miracle. What Feng Chu was doing was simply a miracle. Even in such a disadvantaged state, he was able to persist for so long. If this wasn&rsquo;t a miracle, then what would it be? At the very least, if it was other people, they would not be able to accomplish such a feat.<br>&ldquo;You damned coward! Other than running, do you not know anything else?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Earlier you shouted that arrogantly. And here I thought you were extremely amazing. Turns out you&rsquo;re only a coward who knows nothing other than running away,&rdquo; Dongfang Zexuan was finally unable to contain himself anymore and lashed out against Chu Feng.<br>This Feng Chu had actually managed to be deadlocked against him for six entire hours. Furthermore, no matter how he controlled those thirty-three ferocious beasts, regardless of how he tried to pincer attack that Feng Chu, he was still unable to catch him. As such, how could the proud and conceited Dongfang Zexuan not be enraged? He was simply so enraged that he was about to explode.<br>&ldquo;What? A coward you say? Haha&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing Dongfang Zexuan&rsquo;s curses, Chu Feng actually laughed with contempt and ridicule.<br>&ldquo;What? Am I wrong to call you a coward? You know nothing more than running away like a turtle. You simply do not dare to fight me head-on. If you are not a coward, then what are you?&rdquo; Dongfang Zexuan said.<br>&ldquo;While it is true that I have been running away the entire time, I&rsquo;ve run away for so long, yet have you managed to injure me in the slightest?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Once Chu Feng said those words, all the people present were startled. They carefully looked to Chu Feng and then carefully looked to Dongfang Zexuan. Then, their expressions were filled with shock.<br>Even though Chu Feng had been at a disadvantage ever since Dongfang Zexuan had unleashed his thirty-three ferocious beasts and was forced to flee all over the place for six hours straight,  Chu Feng&rsquo;s clothing was still completely intact. He had not received any injury from Dongfang Zexuan.<br>Those thirty-three enormous and ferocious beasts had unleashed all kinds of attacks at Chu Feng over the course of the six hours. Yet, they had been unable to harm him in the slightest.<br>As for Dongfang Zexuan, although he was holding the upper hand the entire time, his face was currently covered with sweat. This meant that he had exhausted quite a bit of strength to control those thirty-three ferocious beasts, those thirty-three spirit formations, for six entire hours.<br>If Dongfang Zexuan appeared to have held absolute superiority in this match earlier, then, after the six hours of attrition warfare, it had become hard to tell who among the two of them would be the victor.<br>&ldquo;Enough of your bullshit. What use is there in saying all this? If you truly have the skills, then fight me head-on!&rdquo; Dongfang Zexuan shouted in anger.<br>&ldquo;Hah, you are, after all, the Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Third Prince. Coming here to our World Spiritist Alliance, you are a guest. I have held back my attacks the entire time because I was giving you face, giving myself a handicap for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I never would&rsquo;ve expected that you would be this ignorant and unreasonable. I have decided to let you attack me this entire time out of kindness. Yet, not only do you not appreciate the kindness I was showing you, you instead started to insult me. Your moral quality is truly lacking. With how long your Dongfang Imperial Clan has been in existence, have your seniors never taught you how to conduct yourself?&rdquo; When Chu Feng had spoken till this point, he shook his head and sighed. He gave off a sensation of feeling resentment for Dongfang Zexuan&rsquo;s failure to meet his expectations.<br>&ldquo;Bullshit! Is there a need for me to be given a handicap by you? Who do you think yourself to be? You are simply unqualified to be discussed alongside me!&rdquo; Hearing what Chu Feng said, Dongfang Zexuan was so enraged that his face turned green.<br>In his heart, he felt that he had clearly forced Chu Feng to run away in fear. Yet, he actually had the nerve to say those words. How shameless could he be?<br>It was only because this was the World Spiritist Alliance. If it was somewhere else, he would not be wasting his time and would have already used martial power, unleashed his true power and swatted this little bastard to death with a palm strike.<br>&ldquo;Very well, it is you who said that. Since that&rsquo;s the case, there is no need for me to give you a handicap anymore.&rdquo; To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, Chu Feng suddenly stopped his footsteps. He had stopped running away.<br>At the instant he stopped his footsteps, he clasped his palms and abruptly opened them. Following that, a golden-bright and dazzling spirit formation appeared before him.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>That spirit formation was like a weapons warehouse. Countless golden-bright and dazzling weapons were shot out explosively from within that spirit formation.<br>All of the weapons were formed with spirit power. However, they contained extremely terrifying might. After they were shot out from the spirit formation, they swept towards the thirty-three ferocious beasts.<br>&ldquo;Clank, clank, clank, clank, clank~~~~~&rdquo;<br>In an instant, the rumbling noises of metals colliding sounded nonstop like a string of firecrackers. It was even more ear-piercing than thunder.<br>Following the rumbling noises, the thirty-three enormous and ferocious beasts that were filled with killing intent were all pierced through by wave upon wave of weapons. They collapsed, shattered, turned back into spirit power and dispersed into the air.<br>After defeating the thirty-three enormous ferocious beasts, the ten thousand plus weapons stood uniformly around Chu Feng like bodyguards.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Astonishment. Incomparable astonishment. When they saw this scene, everyone present held their breaths in astonishment. The vast plaza had become absolutely silent.<br>All the crowd had been truly stunned. Those thirty-three terrifying, enormous and ferocious beasts were actually all destroyed in an instant.<br>When this Feng Chu possessed this sort of strength, why had he been concealing it the entire time? Could it truly be as he had said? Could he really have deliberately been holding back himself for Dongfang Zexuan?<br>The grand Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Third Prince, an exceptional genius, had actually been given a handicap?<br>No, that was not the important aspect. The crucial matter was that the Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Third Prince had used thirty-three enormous and ferocious beasts to chase after Feng Chu for six entire hours. Yet, he had been unable to injure Feng Chu in the slightest.<br>As for Feng Chu, he had instantly destroyed all thirty-three of the enormous and ferocious beasts that the Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Third Prince had created.<br>The gap. Regardless of whether the crowd was willing to admit it or not, this was truly the gap between the two of them.<br>&ldquo;Cough cough&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Right at the moment when everyone was filled with astonishment, they were woken back up by two light coughs.<br>It was Chu Feng that had coughed. At this moment, he was still standing at where he had previously stood. His hands were behind his back as he looked to Dongfang Zexuan, &ldquo;How was it? Dongfang Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Third Price, are you satisfied with the result of me facing you head-on?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
