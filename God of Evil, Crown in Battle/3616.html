        <h1>Chapter 3615</h1>
        <div> - Bai Liluo&rsquo;s Fine<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;If possible, I truly wish to be able to spend more time with you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he looked at Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Brother, t-t-the f-fu-future is long, w-we&rsquo;ll meet again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Properly t-train yourself. T-the two of us w-will meet a-again at the a-apex of the martial cultivation world,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;You and I will definitely be at the peak of the martial cultivation world. However, let us not meet again there. It will take too long. Instead, we&rsquo;ll advance to the peak together,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Wang Qiang smiled.<br>&ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist at everyone. Then, he turned around and entered the spirit formation gate.<br>Wang Qiang and the others saw Chu Feng off all the way until he disappeared into the spirit formation gate.<br>The feeling of reluctance to part soon spread through the crowd. It was precisely because they were so reluctant to see Chu Feng leave that no one noticed the strange gaze that flashed through the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>After stepping through the spirit formation gate, Chu Feng did not immediately return to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Instead, he entered a spirit formation tunnel.<br>Inside the spirit formation tunnel, Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from thinking about the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>That monster that had lived since the Ancient Era still made him feel uneasy.<br>That said, at the same time, Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from thinking about the things the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted had said to him.<br>&ldquo;Who sealed the Evil God Sword? Who helped me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, that Blood-devouring Demon Exalted spoke of a formation in my body; what&rsquo;s with that?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng wanted to obtain the answer to those questions. Because of that, he needed to think back to what he had experienced.<br>&ldquo;Could it be father?&rdquo; Suddenly, Chu Feng thought of a possibility.<br>Back when Chu Feng was still in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, he was nearly devoured by the Evil God Sword after using it.<br>However, when he woke up, there was no trace of injury on him, and the Evil God Sword also never flared up.<br>If the Evil God Sword was sealed, then the only possible time for it to have been sealed would be when Chu Feng was unconscious.<br>Even though he was unconscious, he managed to indistinctly see his father.<br>Originally, Chu Feng had thought that he was dreaming. After all, that scene was truly not very realistic, and seemed more like a dream.<br>However, Chu Feng was now forced to wonder whether that was truly a dream, or if it was something real.<br>After all, his father was both someone that would be willing to help him and someone who had the ability to help him.<br>&ldquo;You said that you&rsquo;re going to have me train on my own. Yet, in the end, you still secretly helped me.&rdquo;<br>Although Chu Feng was still unable to be certain that it was his father that had helped him, the corners of his mouth rose into a warm smile.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng came to an understanding that it was his father that had sealed away the Evil God Sword for him.<br>As for the formation on his body that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted spoke of, Chu Feng did not know how that came to be.<br>Chu Feng had asked the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted about it later on. However, he was told that since the person who had placed the formation on him didn&rsquo;t want him to know, he would not mention much about it either.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng could only guess that the so-called formation must be related to his father too. Merely, he did not know exactly what sort of formation it was.<br>The spirit formation tunnel was very long. However, it was inevitable for Chu Feng to reach the end.<br>When Chu Feng returned to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, he discovered that not only were the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Chu Xuanzhengfa present, but Li Ruochu, Kong Tianhui, Xia Yun&rsquo;er and many other people were all waiting for him.<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s return, the people that were worried for him immediately started beaming with happiness.<br>Inevitably, they began to ask him about where he went.<br>Chu Feng only told them that he entered a spirit formation tunnel, and arrived there when he exited it.<br>He did not tell them the truth. He was doing that for their own good. That said, he was also trying to not get himself involved in needless trouble.<br>If he were to say that he had entered an isolated space with the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen, encountered the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted in there, and even helped him, many people would definitely ask him questions nonstop. It might even be possible for some people to attack him or the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Thus, it would truly be provoking needless trouble for himself.<br>From the crowd, Chu Feng learned about the matter of the Void Sacred Tree&rsquo;s disappearance.<br>Chu Feng was not too surprised by it. After all, he knew that the enormous floating tree was merely a facade. The actual Void Sacred Tree was that little girl.<br>As for that little girl, she was currently inside him.<br>After a short exchange of pleasantries, Chu Feng did not return to the Chu Heavenly Clan. After all, he had promised Kong Tianhui that he would accompany him back to Divine Body Royal City.<br>Originally, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief wanted to accompany Chu Feng. However, he was met with strong opposition from Kong Tianhui.<br>Kong Tianhui said something about being insistent on having some one-on-one time with Chu Feng.<br>That said, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and everyone else all knew what sort of place Divine Body Royal City was.<br>It was not a place that anyone could enter.<br>Even though the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was now a peak Exalted with the help of Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation treasures, peak Exalted, although very powerful in the eyes of other powers, might not necessarily catch Divine Body Royal City&rsquo;s eyes.<br>After all, a power of their caliber possessed a truly vast amount of peak Exalted.<br>On top of that, Divine Body Royal City had always been hidden from the world. Apart from Ancestral Martial Dragon City and Monstrous Holy City, Divine Body Royal City rarely had dealings with other powers. After so many years, they would refuse to give anyone face.<br>Thus, even if Kong Tianhui decided to welcome the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Divine Body Royal City might not necessarily welcome him.<br>However, it was different for Chu Feng. Chu Feng was, after all, Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son. He was also the genius who had managed to fight Linghu Hongfei to a tie. There were a lot of halos on him. Those halos were capable of obtaining Divine Body Royal City&rsquo;s acknowledgement.<br>Otherwise, Kong Tianhui wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered to challenge him.<br>Thus, Chu Feng left with only Kong Tianhui.<br>However, after Chu Feng and Kong Tianhui left the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the place that they arrived at was not the Divine Body Royal City&rsquo;s Upper Realm.<br>Instead&hellip; they arrived in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.<br>This was the Upper Realm ruled by the Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, are you really going to go to the Tantai Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back in the Void Sacred Tree, you killed some Tantai Heavenly Clansmen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to knock on their door now, wouldn&rsquo;t you be provoking them?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I am from Divine Body Royal City, not even I will be able to protect you if you are to do that,&rdquo; Kong Tianhui said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Even you think what I&rsquo;m doing is very dangerous?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Bullshit! That&rsquo;s not just what I&rsquo;m thinking, that&rsquo;s something that anyone could tell just by looking, okay?&rdquo; said Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;In that case, do you dare to make a bet with me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Betting what?&rdquo; asked Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s bet whether or not the Tantai Heavenly Clan will try to make things difficult for me,&rdquo; after saying those words, Chu Feng started flying toward the location of the Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s the stake?&rdquo; asked Kong Tianhui.<br>&ldquo;We can discuss that later,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled.<br>The reason why Chu Feng had insisted on traveling to the Tantai Heavenly Clan was because he was worried for Bai Liluo. He was there to check out how she was doing.<br>After arriving at the Tantai Heavenly Clan, the Tantai Heavenly Clan not only did not make things difficult for Chu Feng, but they instead welcomed him with warm hospitality. Kong Tianhui was very puzzled when he saw that.<br>At the beginning, Kong Tianhui thought that the Tantai Heavenly Clan was feigning hospitality. He felt that they would definitely take care of Chu Feng once he entered their territory.<br>However, he discovered later on that he was mistaken. The Tantai Heavenly Clan continued to provide warm hospitality to Chu Feng the entire time. They showed no intentions to make things difficult for him.<br>Not only that, but the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief even arrived to personally receive Chu Feng. Furthermore, he apologized to him about what their Tantai Heavenly Clansmen had done in the Void Sacred Tree.<br>Naturally, Chu Feng also managed to meet the Black-feathered Specter without any issue.<br>Chu Feng tried to communicate with Bai Liluo again. Even though there was still an enormous hindrance this time around, and he was unable to smoothly communicate with her, he was still able to make a connection with Bai Liluo.<br>From that, Chu Feng obtained a piece of good news. Bai Liluo was attempting to fuse with the Black-feathered Specter. If she succeeded, she would not only regain her freedom, but she might even obtain the power of the Black-feathered Specter.<br>Upon learning this, Chu Feng&rsquo;s suspended heart was also relieved.<br>After all, he knew very well how powerful Bai Liluo was. Perhaps it would be very difficult for her to fuse with and refine the Black-feathered Specter, but there was a high probability of success.<br>After all, Bai Liluo herself was a very powerful existence.<br>Her power was not merely her exterior strength. Instead, it was her special unfathomable power.<br>Originally, the Tantai Heavenly Clan had wanted to have Chu Feng stay for a couple days.<br>After all, ignoring Chu Feng, Kong Tianhui was also a very important guest.<br>However, Chu Feng only wanted to see how Bai Liluo was doing. After discovering that she was fine, he would naturally not stay for long.<br>Thus, Chu Feng and Kong Tianhui soon continued on their journey again...<br>This time around, Chu Feng was really going to accompany Kong Tianhui to check out Divine Body Royal City, Monstrous Holy City and Ancestral Martial Dragon City.<br></p></div>
