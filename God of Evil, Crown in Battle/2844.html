        <div> - Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s Kiss<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Rank Three Immortal Technique: Ten Thousand Arrows Soulbreaker.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the legendary Immortal Technique created by the Exalted Archer?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is an Immortal Technique that has been lost for a long time. Miss Xia, how did you obtain that?&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing the roll of bamboo slips, the crowd were all very shocked. The reason for that was because the Ten Thousand Arrows Soulbreaker possessed a grand origin.<br>The reason why it was so famous was because of its creator, Exalted Archer.<br>Exalted Archer was a very powerful existence.<br>Reportedly, Exalted Archer only used a bow and arrow as his weapon throughout his entire life. All of his martial skills and techniques were also related to bows and arrows.<br>In the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, if Exalted Archer were to have declared himself to be the second best in terms of using the bow and arrow, no one would dare declare themselves to be the best.<br>That was also the reason why he was known as Exalted Archer.<br>As for the Ten Thousand Arrows Soulbreaker, it was the only Immortal Technique Exalted Archer created in his lifetime.<br>It was also one of the very few treasures left behind by Exalted Archer after his death.<br>Thus, among rank three Immortal Techniques, the Ten Thousand Arrows Soulbreaker could be said to be a very high quality Immortal Technique. Moreover, it was something that had been lost for a very long time. As such, there was no need to doubt how valuable it was.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that I coincidentally obtained at an auction,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;Junior sister, are you really planning to use such an Immortal Technique as the reward for a game? Really planning to give it to someone else?&rdquo;<br>While Xia Yun&rsquo;er was quite indifferent, the disciples from the Starfall Holy Land were all feeling extremely distressed.<br>After all, that was a rank three Immortal Technique, something extremely valuable. If it were to be kept within the Starfall Holy Land, it was totally capable of being categorized as their sect&rsquo;s treasure, and left to only be used by the people of their Starfall Holy Land.<br>However, Xia Yun&rsquo;er was actually planning to give it away. Just thinking about it caused them to feel pain.<br>&ldquo;Senior brother, I am never one to joke around,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said with a serious expression.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xia, you are truly generous.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, many people started to praise Xia Yun&rsquo;er. At the same time, they were all extremely eager. It was as if they were preparing themselves for the upcoming game. The reason for that was because they were all longing for that Ten Thousand Arrows Soulbreaker.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to doubt how valuable the Ten Thousand Arrows Soulbreaker is. However, compared to that, I instead wish to be able to obtain Miss Xia&rsquo;s kiss,&rdquo; Ren Xiaoyao said with a perverted face as he looked at Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Impudent!&rdquo;<br>Once Ren Xiaoyao said those words, the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s male disciples were all furious. Even Song Yunfei&rsquo;s expression turned exceptionally cold and gloomy.<br>The air in the region turned incomparably cold. It was so oppressive that one would start to feel as if one would choke.<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip; I was merely joking. Don&rsquo;t take it seriously.&rdquo;<br>Ren Xiaoyao realized that the situation was bad. He hurriedly revealed a smile on his face and began to gesture with his hand to indicate that he was merely joking, and not being serious.<br>However, the anger on the faces of the crowd from the Starfall Holy Land remained unchanged.<br>With cold voices, they said, &ldquo;How could we possibly allow you to blaspheme our Holy Daughter?!&rdquo;<br>It could be seen that Ren Xiaoyao had truly touched upon their taboo.<br>&ldquo;I was wrong, I was wrong, okay? Miss Xia, I was shooting off my mouth, I was wrong. It&rsquo;s all because of this terrible mouth of mine. I should be punished.&rdquo;<br>Ren Xiaoyao immediately started to apologize to Xia Yun&rsquo;er. He even lightly slapped his mouth a couple times.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s merely a kiss. That&rsquo;s actually nothing serious,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;Yun&rsquo;er, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Once Xia Yun&rsquo;er said those words, Song Yunfei&rsquo;s expression changed. He looked to Xia Yun&rsquo;er and wanted to say something, only to end up hesitating. He seemed to have been placed in a very difficult situation.<br>At that moment, Her Lady Queen said with a mischievous laugh, &ldquo;It would seem that Song Yunfei is also interested in that Xia Yun&rsquo;er.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng, on the other hand, did not say anything. He actually already knew that Song Yunfei was interested in Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>While this Song Yunfei pretended to be a very righteous person, he was actually a very scheming individual. Even though he had spoken on behalf of Chu Feng and helped Chu Feng block Ren Xiaoyao&rsquo;s attack, Chu Feng was still on guard against him.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng felt that, compared to Ren Xiaoyao, that Song Yunfei was even more dangerous.<br>As the saying goes, it is easy to dodge a spear in the open, but hard to avoid a knife in the dark.<br>If Ren Xiaoyao was a spear in the open, then Song Yunfei would be a knife in the dark.<br>&ldquo;Junior sister Yun&rsquo;er, you must not make this sort of joke.&rdquo;<br>After a moment of hesitation, Song Yunfei still ended up speaking out against it. It could be seen that he was extremely against Xia Yun&rsquo;er doing that sort of thing.<br>Faced with Song Yunfei&rsquo;s voice of objection and the crowd&rsquo;s astonished gazes, Xia Yun&rsquo;er merely smiled a sweet smile. Then, she raised up the Ten Thousand Arrows Soulbreaker bamboo slip scroll and gently kissed it with her alluring red lips.<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er raised up the Ten Thousand Arrows Soulbreaker and said with a beaming smile on her face, &ldquo;Here you go. I, Xia Yun&rsquo;er, am able to afford to give a kiss like this.&rdquo;<br>When one looked closely, one would actually see Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s kiss on the bamboo slip scroll that held the Ten Thousand Arrows Soulbreaker.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the males present were reacting as if some sort of power within their bodies had awakened. They were so excited that their eyes became fixed. They were fixed onto the lip marks on the bamboo slip scroll. Their eyes were not letting go of it.<br>In fact, their gazes had changed. Their eyes seemed to actually be shining.<br>Furthermore, for the relatively more perverted men like Ren Xiaoyao, they began to gulp down saliva.<br>Even for Song Yunfei, even though he appeared very calm and composed, his gaze had revealed to Chu Feng that he was no longer calm and composed.<br>However, all of this was normal. After all, that was a bamboo slip scroll kissed by Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>Who was Xia Yun&rsquo;er? She was one of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s Three Great Beauties, the Starfall Holy Land&rsquo;s Holy Daughter.<br>Merely that kiss would be sufficient to increase the value of the Ten Thousand Arrows Soulbreaker to a next level.<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er fiddled with the scroll of bamboo slips she held in her hand. Proudly, she asked, &ldquo;Is there anyone that is willing to participate in the game?&rdquo;<br>Evidently, she was feeling delighted that she was capable of driving so many men crazy and mad.<br>The reason for that was because Xia Yun&rsquo;er took great pleasure in being able to toy with others within the palm of her hand.<br>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Me, me!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Me, me, me!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Miss Xia, I am willing to participate.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the airs of craziness filled the entire space.<br>Practically all of the men present voiced their desire to participate. Even Song Yunfei was unable to contain himself, and quietly shouted out &lsquo;me.&rsquo;<br>In fact, even the women present were all raising their hands to indicate their desire to participate in the game.<br>Of course, it might not necessarily be because they liked Xia Yun&rsquo;er and wanted her kiss. After all, the Ten Thousand Arrows Soulbreaker itself was already extremely enticing.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, what about you?&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er looked to Chu Feng.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng was the only person left, with the exception of Xia Yun&rsquo;er, that had not voiced his desire to participate in the game.<br>After Xia Yun&rsquo;er asked him that question, Chu Feng felt many ill-intended and jealous gazes.<br>That was also understandable. After all, practically all of the men present were interested in Xia Yun&rsquo;er. Yet, Xia Yun&rsquo;er only treated Chu Feng differently. This caused them to feel extremely displeased.<br>That being said, Chu Feng completely ignored those ill-intended gazes. Chu Feng had witnessed countless people that hated him in his journey so far. As such, how could Chu Feng possibly care about them?<br>Chu Feng said to Xia Yun&rsquo;er, &ldquo;Since everyone is going to participate, I naturally cannot dampen the spirit. Merely&hellip; I want to know exactly how we play this game, this Everchanging Mystery Realm?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young Master Chu Feng, please have a look.&rdquo;<br>As Xia Yun&rsquo;er spoke, she opened the stone box.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, a vast amount of light emerged from the box. Then, brilliant blue light flew out from the box. Once it flew out, it started to rapidly expand in size.<br>It turned out that there was actually a spirit formation contained within the stone box.<br>The spirit formation was dark blue in color. Apart from the symbols and runes, only a single stamp located in the center of the spirit formation was distinctive.<br>That stamp should have been created through the use of a spirit formation. However, it was an actual substance. At a glance, it resembled an official seal used by monarchs. This caused it to give off the airs of a ruler.<br>&ldquo;You merely need to sit cross-legged and instill your spirit power into the spirit formation to participate in the game.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When I activate the spirit formation, the Everchanging Mystery Realm will begin its operation. At that time, your consciousnesses will all enter the Everchanging Mystery Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Upon entering it, you all will be able to obtain special instructions and know about the rules regarding the game. As for what the rules will be, I do not know either. The reason for that is because the rules of the Everchanging Mystery Realm change every time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The only thing I am certain about is that when the final victor wakes up, that Victor&rsquo;s Seal will land on his or her hand.&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er pointed to the stamp at the center of the spirit formation.<br><br><br></p></div>
