        <div> - Do Not Court Death<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Gusu and Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er were surprised to hear Chu Feng&rsquo;s name. But, they were soon able to understand why Xianhai Shaoyu said Chu Feng.<br>After all, both of them knew that while the black case was very powerful, it was something that concerned one&rsquo;s talent.<br>The two of them both acknowledged Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent.<br>&ldquo;While Chu Feng&rsquo;s current cultivation is still lacking, his talent is beyond measure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Opening this artifact required talent. Furthermore, people could take it on together.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I encounter dangers trying to open it myself, Chu Feng will be able to help me shoulder that danger.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, Chu Feng must be called to my help the moment I encounter danger to my life. Else, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make it in time to save me,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Lord young master, would I be able to share the burden if I enter it?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Xin&rsquo;er, you are definitely talented. But, your talent would not be enough to open this item.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As such, you should not accompany me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It will be too dangerous for you,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Young master, why don&rsquo;t you have Chu Feng open that case together with you from the start?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;My purpose is to challenge myself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I have Chu Feng share the burden from the start, it would be completely meaningless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Asking for Chu Feng&rsquo;s help would be if I had no alternative. Personally, I do not wish for that to happen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But&hellip; I also do not wish to die trying to challenge this thing. Thus, it is better to be prepared than sorry,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. If you are to seek out Chu Feng&rsquo;s help, you must inform him how dangerous this case is. You cannot deceive him to make him enter it,&rdquo; Xianhai Shaoyu said to Lady Gusu.<br>The meaning behind those words were very clear.<br>He wanted Chu Feng to know that he might end up losing his life challenging that case.<br>He wanted to give Chu Feng the choice as to whether or not to enter the case.<br>If Chu Feng refused to enter, Xianhai Gusu was not to force him.<br>&ldquo;Senior Gusu, you must promise me that you will not force Chu Feng if he&rsquo;s unwilling,&rdquo; emphasized Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>The reason why he deliberately said that was because he understood Xianhai Gusu&rsquo;s personality.<br>He knew that Xianhai Gusu would be capable of doing anything for the sake of his safety.<br>If Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t go in to help him voluntarily, it would be of no use even if he went in.<br>&ldquo;This subordinate understands.&rdquo;<br>Lady Gusu accepted Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s request.<br>She knew what he was thinking.<br>&ldquo;But young master, if Lady Gusu is to go and seek for Chu Feng&rsquo;s help, wouldn&rsquo;t we end up exposing our identities?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;If things come to that&hellip;&rdquo;<br>As he said those words, Xianhai Shaoyu looked to Lady Gusu.<br>&ldquo;Senior Gusu, you don&rsquo;t have to explain anything to Chu Feng. I will personally explain things to him myself,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>Then, Xianhai Shaoyu began to forcibly open the black case.<br>The method he used was very special.<br>He was using various special treasures.<br>As the opening of the black case will cause a massive commotion, he needed to shift that commotion to the Outer World.<br>He cannot allow for that commotion to occur on the Reincarnation Upper Realm.<br>After all, he already knew that there were many powerful creatures hidden in the Reincarnation Upper Realm.<br>For example, there was that terrifying existence that covered the entire sky.<br>If he ended up luring that existence over here, he wouldn&rsquo;t know if it would be a blessing or a disaster.<br>After all, before their own interests, cultivators&hellip; would oftentimes reveal their greed.<br>Shifting such a massive commotion to the Outer World was an impossible task for Xianhai Shaoyu if he was to utilize his own strength.<br>That was why he needed to borrow the strength of powerful treasures.<br>After some time, the black case finally successfully opened.<br>But, neither Xianhai Gusu or Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er knew what the opened case looked like.<br>The reason for that was because only a spirit formation gate remained after the black case opened.<br>Only by entering that spirit formation gate would one know how powerful the black case was.<br>But, Xianhai Shaoyu did not permit Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er to follow him inside.<br>Furthermore, as there was an age restriction, Lady Gusu was unable to enter either.<br>But, that black case&rsquo;s spirit formation gate appeared extremely terrifying.<br>Merely seeing that spirit formation gate brought them great unease.<br>This made Xianhai Gusu and Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er extremely worried.<br>&ldquo;Xin&rsquo;er, take this.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If the situation turns bad, enter it immediately and help Lord young master withstand that power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Remember, you cannot wait until the time when Lord young master is in fatal dager to eter. If there&rsquo;s any sign of danger, you are to enter immediately.&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Gusu handed Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s Life Talisman paper to Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Lady Gusu, where are you going?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er.<br>But, she actually already had a guess. She was asking a question she already knew the answer to.<br>&ldquo;Naturally to find Chu Feng,&rdquo; said Xianhai Gusu.<br>&ldquo;But Lady Gusu, young master said that we cannot seek out Chu Feng unless there&rsquo;s no other alternative,&rdquo; said Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Silly girl. Is young master&rsquo;s life more important or are those rules more important?&rdquo; said Xianhai Gusu.<br>&ldquo;Xin&rsquo;er understands.&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er reached terms. She too felt that Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s life was more important.<br>Even though they will be going against his order, they would at most be punished.<br>Furthermore, Xianhai Shaoyu, with her personality, rarely punishes others. At most he would only scold them.<br>But, if they were to follow his rules and ended up killing him, not only will their Lord Clan Chief blame them, they will not be able to forgive themselves either.<br>&ldquo;Xin&rsquo;er, remember this. If there&rsquo;s any sign of fluctuation with young master&rsquo;s life, you are to enter right away.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You absolutely cannot delay.&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Gusu reemphasized sternly.<br>&ldquo;Lady Gusu, please rest assured. Xin&rsquo;er will definitely act accordingly,&rdquo; ensured Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er.<br>Then, Xianhai Gusu entered the Seven Suns Mountain Range to seek out Chu Feng.<br>The protective formation around the Seven Suns Mountain Range was personally set up by Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>But, even Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s spirit formation was unable to stop Xianhai Gusu.<br>Currently, Chu Feng was inside a forbidden region of the Seven Suns Mountain Range. Together with him were Grandmaster Tang Chen, Ox-nosed Old Daoist, Yuan Shu and Yu Ting.<br>Suddenly, a figure landed in this forbidden region.<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen and Yuan Shu were immediately alerted.<br>And, upon seeing who it was that arrived, even Chu Feng revealed a shocked look.<br>&ldquo;Senior, it&rsquo;s you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But why would you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing Xianhai Gusu who appeared all of a sudden, Chu Feng was extremely surprised.<br>As he doesn&rsquo;t know the truth, he still thought her to be Shaoyu and Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandmother.<br>According to his knowledge, this senior shouldn&rsquo;t appear in this place.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Shaoyu is in trouble. I need your help.&rdquo;<br>Xianhai Gusu immediately grabbed Chu Feng and was about to bring him away.<br>&ldquo;Halt! Who are you?!&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen immediately unleashed his oppressive might to stop her.<br>After all, he doesn&rsquo;t know who Xianhai Gusu was. He couldn&rsquo;t allow for a strange to forcibly bring Chu Feng away.<br>&ldquo;Do not court death!&rdquo;<br>Once Grandmaster Tang Chen unleashed his oppressive might, Xianhai Gusu&rsquo;s gaze turned cold.<br>She merely took a glance at Grandmaster Tang Chen before his complexion turned deathly pale. As if petrified, he stood completely frozen.<br>Even though Xianhai Gusu did not unleash her oppressive might at all, her gaze was enough to completely crumble Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>Merely from a single gaze, Grandmaster Tang Chen realized that there was an enormous disparity between their strength.<br>At the instant he was frozen in place, Xianhai Gusu disappeared with Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
