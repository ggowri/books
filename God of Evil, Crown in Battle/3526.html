        <h1>Chapter 3525</h1>
        <div> - Chu Feng, Scram Out Here<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Chu Chengkong also arrived.<br>The reason why Chu Chengkong rushed back so quickly was because he wanted to report the joyous matter of Chu Feng obtaining the first ranked spot in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars to the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Although the Chu Heavenly Clansmen felt utter disbelief when hearing such news from the mouths of others, they became completely convinced after hearing it from Chu Chengkong.<br>After all, they all knew his character. They knew that he was a very sincere and honest man. Although his cultivation was not very powerful, his upright and honest character was very rare in the current world of martial cultivation.<br>With such a happy occasion and so many powerful experts arriving at their Chu Heavenly Clan, the Chu Heavenly Clan naturally opened up to provide them with warm hospitality. Immediately, they decided to hold a banquet to entertain these experts that had arrived from far away.<br>Seeing that the situation had turned bad, the Goldenstone Royal Clan and Hong Beast Clan planned to take advantage of the fact that everyone was feeling merry to leave.<br>&ldquo;Brother Hong, didn&rsquo;t you need to seek me out for something? Why are you leaving already?&rdquo;<br>However, right when the Goldenstone Royal Clan and Hong Beast Clan tried to slip away, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s voice was immediately heard.<br>Once he spoke, the eyes of the crowd all turned to the Goldenstone Royal Clan and Hong Beast Clan. At that moment, the two clans that were originally unnoticed by anyone became the focus of the crowd.<br>At that moment, the armies from the Goldenstone Royal Clan and the Hong Beast Clan, including even the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, were scared speechless. They began to shoot meaningful glances at the Hong Beast Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief repeatedly. They wanted him to help them explain the situation.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, truly, congratulations. I never expected such a genius to emerge from your clan. It's truly worthy of celebration!&rdquo;<br>The Hong Beast Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had an embarrassed expression as he forced a smile. Merely, that smile of his was very ugly. The crowd present were all able to tell how strange that smile of his was.<br>&ldquo;Many thanks, Brother Hong. That said, Brother Hong, I seem to recall that you did not come here to congratulate us,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>Once the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said those words, the Hong Beast Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief immediately realized that it would not be so simple to try to slip his way out. Thus, he said, &ldquo;Indeed, I had not come for this matter. As the saying goes, it is better to squash enmity than to keep it alive. Today, I had come because I wanted to inform Brother Chu that we should forget the grudges from back then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, why were you in a rush to leave earlier?&rdquo; asked Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>&ldquo;Today is a day of celebration for your clan. I thought that it would be better that we discuss this matter of reconciliation another day,&rdquo; the Hong Beast Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Hong, if you had come for the sake of reconciliation, why did you shout so loudly and aggressively outside our territory? Furthermore, you were insulting our clan&rsquo;s clan chief,&rdquo; said a Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elder.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Had you come for reconciliation, how could you be shouting for our clan chief to scram out here? In my opinion, you had clearly come here to court trouble,&rdquo; many other Chu Heavenly Clan elders began to speak out against the Hong Beast Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. They were all people in charge of guarding the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s borders. Thus, they had all heard the words of the Hong Beast Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief clearly.<br>Previously, they did not dare to speak out against him because they were afraid of his strength.<br>However, there were now many experts present to back them up. With this, they gained sufficient courage, and were finally able to vent their anger.<br>At that moment, many other elders of the Chu Heavenly Clan also began to criticize the Hong Beast Clan and the Goldenstone Royal Clan. They revealed what had truly happened to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Turns out you all came here seeking trouble.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing for the Hong Beast Clan to come. Yet, Goldenstone Royal Clan, why have you all decided to accompany them?&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa turned his furious gaze to the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Zhengfa, it&rsquo;s a misunderstanding. We did not come here seeking trouble,&rdquo; the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief finally opened his mouth. However, the tone with which he spoke was very feeble.<br>He actually did not wish to show such weakness either. However, there was no other option.<br>Although the various experts that came to congratulate the Chu Heavenly Clan did not say anything, they were all looking at the Goldenstone Royal Clan and the Hong Beast Clan with hostile gazes.<br>While the Goldenstone Royal Clan and the Hong Beast Clan were not afraid of the Chu Heavenly Clan, they were afraid of those powers that came to congratulate them.<br>They were no fools. They had realized that Chu Feng had managed to change the status of the Chu Heavenly Clan in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>After all, they had witnessed the change in the attitude of the various major powers in the Ancestral Martial Starfield towards the Chu Heavenly Clan back when Chu Xuanyuan rose to power.<br>Thus, they knew very well that no matter how unreconciled they might be, they could not make an enemy out of the Chu Heavenly Clan. At the very least, they could not do so just yet.<br>Originally, they had planned to slip away with their tails between their legs. However, they ended up being caught.<br>At that moment, they felt completely at a loss as to how to explain the situation. After all, they had indeed said those unpleasant words earlier.<br>If one must blame something, then it could only be said that they were too unfortunate. They had planned to seek revenge for what had happened back then with the large force that they&rsquo;d mustered.<br>Never would they have ever imagined that a genius of the younger generation would suddenly appear from the Chu Heavenly Clan. Furthermore, that person even obtained the first ranked spot amongst the Ancestral Martial Decastars, where even someone as heaven-defying as Linghu Hongfei was unable to defeat him.<br>Because of that, various powers arrived to offer congratulations. Although they might call it &lsquo;offering congratulations.&rsquo; they were simply here to make connections.<br>It would be one thing had it been other powers that came. However, so many of the Ten Great Heavenly Clans came. Even the Tantai Heavenly Clan came.<br>With the situation like this, how exactly was the Goldenstone Royal Clan supposed to handle it?<br>Even the Hong Beast Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was scared and trying hard to find a pretext, an excuse.<br>At this moment, the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was truly frightened. Even his voice was trembling.<br>As for the Hong Beast Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, he had an awkward expression on his face, and was forcing a wry smile. He too was at a loss as to how to justify his way out of this situation.<br>When even the two clan chiefs were acting in such a manner, one could very well imagine the frame of mind of their clansmen. They all felt that an imminent catastrophe would befall them.<br>Suddenly, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s forget about it. Brother Hong, let us forget about what happened back then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief,&rdquo; hearing those words, Chu Xuanzhengfa and many other elders immediately called out to their Lord Clan Chief.<br>They all knew that the Hong Beast Clan had come precisely to seek trouble, and that they should not let them get away with it just like that.<br>&ldquo;Enough. It&rsquo;s as Brother Hong said, it is better to squash enmity than to keep it alive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Hong, Clan Chief Jinshi, since you&rsquo;ve all come here already, you should come in and enjoy yourselves,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, thanks a lot,&rdquo; the Hong Beast Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief clasped his fist at the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief in a very serious manner.<br>As for the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, his reaction was even more exaggerated. He actually began to nod and bow repeatedly in a very eagerly attentive manner.<br>They had not expected the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to actually spare them like that.<br>One must know that although the Chu Heavenly Clan might not be a match for them, there were many experts present seeking to build a relationship with the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Should the Chu Heavenly Clan desire to attack them, those people would definitely not watch with folded arms.<br>In short, if the Chu Heavenly Clan wanted to take care of them, both of their clans would be unable to leave safely.<br>As such, the current situation was something that they&rsquo;d never anticipated.<br>Of course, everyone had their own way of thinking.<br>The Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief felt that he had escaped from a calamity because of his luck.<br>As for the Hong Beast Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, he felt that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was giving him sufficient face by not making the situation too difficult for him. He firmly remembered the face that he had been given.<br>In that very instant, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had turned from an enemy to a friend in his heart. Thus, his words of thanks were actually very meaningful.<br>&ldquo;Is that brat by the name of Chu Feng here?! Tell him to scram out here for this young master!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice exploded from outside the crowd.<br>This sudden voice shattered their joyous mood.<br>Everyone wanted to know which fool it was that dared to seek out trouble at such a time.<br>The crowd scattered. After that, a person of the younger generation was seen standing before the vast crowd.<br>Furthermore, that person was all alone.<br>Before the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan said anything, an elder from the Goldenstone Royal Clan criticized, &ldquo;Which insolent younger generation is it that dares to behave so atrociously here?&rdquo;<br>Because they were spared by the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, that elder wanted to find an opportunity to curry favor from the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>For someone to dare to seek trouble at such a time, and for that person to be a person of the younger generation too, he felt that his opportunity had come. Thus, without even thinking, he immediately berated that person.<br>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; However, to everyone&rsquo;s surprise, the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief immediately shouted angrily at that elder.<br>In the beginning, that elder was confused. It was only later that he suddenly discovered that many of the people present were looking at that person of the younger generation strangely.<br>Thus, he began to carefully size him up. It was only when he discovered the title plate on that person&rsquo;s waist that he came to a sudden realization.<br>In an instant&hellip; his body was covered in cold sweat. He was actually shivering with fear.<br></p></div>
