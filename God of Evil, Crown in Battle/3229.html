        <div> - Tracking Talisman<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside the Holy Spirit Formation of Light. The Linghu Heavenly Clansmen all had excited looks on their faces.<br>They had each plundered many Symbols of Light, and were able to feel that the Symbols of Light on their foreheads were indeed much stronger than those of the people that they&rsquo;d plundered them from.<br>That said, whilst the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen were feeling very satisfied and excited, the Nightmare Spirit Clansmen and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clansmen were feeling extremely envious.<br>The ones that had plundered the imprisoned newcomers of their Symbols of Light earlier were only the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen. As for the Nightmare Spirit Clansmen and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clansmen, they&rsquo;d been standing to one side and acting as spectators the entire time.<br>It was not that they did not want to join. Instead, they didn&rsquo;t dare. The reason for that was because they could not forget that the Linghu Heavenly Clan was the actual ruler of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. Even the fact that they were able to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light was thanks to the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>Thus, even in there, they still didn&rsquo;t forget their status as masters and servants.<br>That said, they were also itching to quickly extract the cultivation resources of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>Finally, Mengyan Wushuang was unable to contain himself from asking Linghu Lun, &ldquo;Brother Linghu, when can we go and seek out cultivation resources?&rdquo;<br>Once he asked that question, the Nightmare Spirit Clansmen and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clansmen immediately revealed concerned looks.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so anxious,&rdquo; Linghu Lun smiled faintly. Then, he walked to the bottom-most region of the abnormal sign.<br>There was a spirit formation there. That spirit formation was the source of the abnormal sign.<br>Soon, Linghu Lun walked out from that spirit formation. Furthermore, Linghu Lun had a smile on his face as he walked out.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Linghu Lun raised his arm, and many wondrous bodies of light began to fly toward the Nightmare Spirit Clansmen and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clansmen.<br>&ldquo;These are?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the body of light in their hands, the Nightmare Spirit Clansmen and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clansmen all revealed a change in expression.<br>Holding those bodies of light in their hand, they were able to sense a special sort of power. It was a guiding power.<br>&ldquo;Brother Linghu, what are these?&rdquo; Mengyan Wushuang asked.<br>&ldquo;Those are tracking talismans. They are capable of tracking all the people that have condensed a Symbol of Light.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, I will hand a mission to you all. Capture all the people that have condensed a Symbol of Light and bring them back here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Finish that mission, and you all will be allowed to extract the natural resources of this place,&rdquo; Linghu Lun said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Linghu, since you have such a trick, why did you bother to wait for them to walk into the trap? Why didn&rsquo;t you have us capture them to begin with?&rdquo; Tongtian Yuanming asked with a puzzled look.<br>He felt that since Linghu Lun possessed such a trick, they could use it from the very start. There was no need to waste time setting up that abnormal sign. After all, Tongtian Yuanming was confident that the time they spent on setting up the abnormal sign would have been enough for him to capture all of those newcomers himself.<br>&ldquo;Yuanming, oh Yuanming, they all say that the Heaven-reaching Monstrous Clan has great talent for martial cultivation, but lacks the brains of cultivators. Originally, I didn&rsquo;t believe that. Are you trying to force me to believe that?&rdquo; Linghu Lun revealed great disdain at Tongtian Yuanming&rsquo;s question.<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, the tracking talismans must be related to that grand formation that created the abnormal sign, right?&rdquo; Mengyan Wushuang said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Wushuang, you are the incisive one,&rdquo; Linghu Lun nodded in satisfaction.<br>Then, he said, &ldquo;Now, you all should know why I&rsquo;ve gathered you all here and spent all that time, effort and even used treasures to set up this grand formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for all that is because this grand formation will not only produce an abnormal sign, but it is also capable of connecting to the power of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light. When the Holy Spirit Formation of Light enters its &lsquo;unsealed phase,&rsquo; tracking talismans will rise from this grand formation,&rdquo; Linghu Lun explained.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case, so that&rsquo;s the case. I was foolish. Hehe. I was slow-witted,&rdquo; Tongtian Yuanming came to a sudden realization after hearing the explanation, and laughed awkwardly.<br>&ldquo;Well then, stop wasting time. Go and capture all those newcomers who are incapable of differentiating good from bad. Do that, and you all will be able to enjoy the cultivation resources here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Do not seize the Symbols of Light from those newcomers without my permission. If anyone dares to do that, do not blame me for becoming impolite,&rdquo; Linghu Lun warned.<br>&ldquo;Understood!&rdquo;<br>That utterance of &lsquo;understood&rsquo; was not a lie. Instead, they truly understood it, and took it to heart.<br>Although the Linghu Heavenly Clan had schemed this to profit them greatly, and ordered it so that only they could seize the Symbols of Light, while the Nightmare Spirit Clan and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clan were merely their tools, the Nightmare Spirit Clansmen and Heaven-reaching Beast Clansmen were delighted to be exploited by the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>The reason for that was because even though they were being exploited, they would, at the very least, have the opportunity to seek out and extract the cultivation resources. None of them were willing to miss out on the opportunity.<br>&ldquo;What about us?&rdquo;<br>After the Nightmare Spirit Clansmen and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clansmen left, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen all turned to ask Linghu Lun.<br>&ldquo;We will stay here and wait,&rdquo; Linghu Lun said.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to wait here? Are we going to allow the Nightmare Spirit Clansmen and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clansmen to seize the cultivation resources of this place and waste our time waiting here?&rdquo;<br>Many Linghu Heavenly Clansmen revealed puzzled expressions upon hearing Linghu Lun&rsquo;s plan.<br>Linghu Lun did not answer them immediately. Instead, he inspected his surroundings with his spirit power and perceptive power. After verifying that the Nightmare Spirit Clansmen and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clansmen had all left, he said, &ldquo;Do you all know why big brother Tiemian decided to allow the Nightmare Spirit Clansmen and the Heaven-reaching Beast Clansmen into the Formation of Light this time around?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; The Linghu Heavenly Clansmen asked.<br>&ldquo;In that case, do you all know when we discovered that the Symbols of Light could be plundered from one another?&rdquo; Linghu Lun asked instead of answering.<br>&ldquo;It was during the last Formation of Light,&rdquo; The crowd replied in unison.<br>The Linghu Heavenly Clan had only discovered that the Symbols of Light could be plundered during the last Formation of Light.<br>After all, it would generally only be the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen that would enter the Formation of Light. There was no reason for them to plunder the Symbols of Light from one another.<br>It was only during their last Formation of Light that, by pure coincidence, someone plundered another person&rsquo;s Symbol of Light. Because of that, the Linghu Heavenly Clan learned of the ability to plunder one another&rsquo;s Symbol of Light.<br></p></div>
