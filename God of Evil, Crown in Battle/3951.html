        <h1>Chapter 3950</h1>
        <div> - The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Strongest<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Milord, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;<br>Linghu Yueyue looked to Chu Feng with a look of confusion.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to explain properly. To put it simply, I was able to bring you away from here earlier. However, I am now unable to do so.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng revealed an embarrassed and somewhat helpless smile. Then, he asked Linghu Yueyue, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to wait for me outside? Why did you come in here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I was afraid that Lord Asura would encounter danger. Yet, I was uncertain whether this bottle gourd was effective or not. Thus, I decided to come here myself to test out the effect of this bottle gourd.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If this bottle gourd truly had the effective of withstanding the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms, I would then be able to help Lord Asura.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, this place is simply too vast. I neglected how profound Lord Asura&rsquo;s cultivation was, and forgot that I am simply unable to catch up to you. Because of that, I ended up getting lost in here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Originally, I was able to barely search for Lord Asura with the power of this bottle gourd. Never would I have imagined that I&rsquo;d end up encountering Utmost Exalted-level Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms later on. They are simply too powerful. I am unable to escape from them at all. Because of that, I ended up being trapped here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am truly sorry. I&rsquo;ve caused trouble for Lord Asura again.&rdquo;<br>The more Linghu Yueyue explained, the more deflated she became. Her eyes had actually turned red.<br>She was not a cowardly individual. Chu Feng knew very well that her reaction did not come from fear. Instead, she was reacting this way out of self-blame.<br>She was blaming herself for her preposterous actions that caused Chu Feng to fall into danger.<br>Seeing that Linghu Yueyue seemed to be on the verge of crying, Chu Feng immediately said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough. It&rsquo;s not your fault. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the bottle gourd&rsquo;s power, I would&rsquo;ve died earlier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Speaking of it, that bottle gourd is truly not to be looked down on.&rdquo;<br>Hearing Chu Feng saying those words, the look of guilt on Linghu Yueyue&rsquo;s face didn&rsquo;t decrease. &ldquo;It would appear that Milord has already learned of the origin of this bottle gourd. I truly never imagined for this bottle gourd to be this powerful. Unfortunately, even though it is able to withstand the attacks of Utmost Exalted-level existences, its functions are limited.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, please look carefully at this protective formation. There are minute cracks appearing on it. If there are even more powerful Utmost Exalted Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms, then perhaps the power unleashed by the bottle gourd will not be able to block their attacks,&rdquo; Linghu Yueyue said as she pointed to the protective formation released from within the bottle gourd.<br>That said, Chu Feng had actually already noticed the cracks without her mentioning it.<br>Chu Feng noticed that the strongest among the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms attacking them were rank three Utmost Exalteds. From this, it would appear that if a rank five Utmost Exalted or perhaps even a rank four Utmost Exalted were to attack, the bottle gourd&rsquo;s power might not be able to last.<br>Although they&rsquo;d managed to avoid a calamity, their current situation was still far from optimistic.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the surrounding waters started trembling.<br>Then, Chu Feng could hear ear-piercing roars.<br>Those were the roars emitted by countless Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms. In fact, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms besieging them stopped attacking them and began roaring too.<br>Their roars sounded like cheers. Chu Feng could tell that those Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms seemed to be extremely pleased.<br>Suddenly, an aura swept forth from deep beneath the waters.<br>&ldquo;Milord, this feeling?!&rdquo;<br>Linghu Yueyue&rsquo;s face was immediately covered with fear the moment she sensed that aura. Terrified, her complexion became pale, and she began shivering.<br>Even Chu Feng was frowning and calling out &lsquo;oh no&rsquo; in his heart.<br>The aura they felt was simply too oppressive. That aura felt as if it came from hell, and possessed overwhelming destructive nature.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the spirit formation has been completely destroyed. The strongest Ancient Era&rsquo;s organism previously sealed deep underground have emerged.&rdquo;<br>That was Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess. However, he felt that that was most likely the case.<br>Their foe was simply too powerful. Even though it did not unleash any attacks at Chu Feng and Linghu Yueyue, the overwhelming aura it emitted had already exceeded Chu Feng&rsquo;s judgement.<br>He was simply unable to determine if what had emerged was still an Utmost Exalted.<br>If it wasn&rsquo;t an Utmost Exalted anymore, wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that it was a Martial Exalted?<br>Even rank one Utmost Exalted would be able to obliterate Chu Feng. If a Martial Exalted-level existence were to appear, how exactly was he supposed to withstand it?<br>Even the power of the bottle gourd was most definitely going to be destroyed by a single attack.<br>&ldquo;Milady, senior, please help me again. Please help me escape from this place. I will definitely remember your grace.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng began to attempt to converse with the divine deer in his heart.<br>However, he received no response.<br>If the divine deer didn&rsquo;t want to talk to him, it was simply impossible for him to connect with it.<br>It was a special existence, and not as simple as a mere secret skill.<br>&ldquo;Ignorant humans! It is because of you all that this Exalted was trapped here!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This Exalted did not go find you, yet you actually dared to intrude upon this Exalted&rsquo;s territory?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, I shall take your life first!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a very powerful and ancient voice sounded from the depths of the water.<br>Then, Chu Feng could sense boundless killing intent rushing towards him with a speed beyond comprehension.<br>Together with the boundless killing intent was the aura of death.<br>That aura of death was simply too terrifying. Even though it was still far away, Linghu Yueyue was already bleeding from her seven facial apertures, and had fallen unconscious.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was unable to concern himself with helping her anymore, for he knew very well that even he would die.<br>Furthermore, he did not have to wait long for death. It was going to arrive very quickly.<br>With such an enormous disparity in strength, the only thing Chu Feng could do was wait for death.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed. He was shocked to discover that the aura of death that had clearly reached him had suddenly disappeared.<br>There was no prior indication at all. Just like that, it had disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Roarrrr~~~&rdquo;<br>Then, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms that had surrounded him began to scream miserably.<br>Chu Feng was able to see that their bodies were disintegrating. Even though they were Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms, their blood was still red.<br>As their bodies disintegrated, their blood dyed the surrounding water red. In an instant, all the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms had died.<br>It was not only the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms that surrounded Chu Feng that had died. All of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms present in the body of water had disappeared.<br>It was as if a power had entered from above the waters, and wherever it passed, all the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms were obliterated.<br>At that moment, that power was pressing towards the depths of the water. Evidently, it was planning to completely remove all the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms present.<br>Chu Feng felt completely stunned. That power was simply too terrifying. It was simply unstoppable. All the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms were unable to contend against it. In a flash, they were all killed. Not even corpses remained.<br>However, Chu Feng was unable to sense any oppressive might, nor was he able to sense any destructive aura.<br>That power was simply formless.<br>&ldquo;Could it be, it&rsquo;s that so-called catastrophe again?&rdquo;<br>This thought came to Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind. However, he was unable to confirm anything.<br>Earlier, those Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms outside had also been completely erased by some sort of intangible power.<br>That greatly resembled what was going on right now. Yet, the way they were killed was completely different.<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms outside had had their bodies reduced to ash. They had not left behind the slightest drop of blood. It seemed as if they had been directly erased.<br>As for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms in the lake, they died by through the disintegration of their bodies. Otherwise, they wouldn&rsquo;t have dyed the lake red.<br>As the death signs were completely different, Chu Feng was unable to be certain if it was that &lsquo;catastrophe.&rsquo;<br></p></div>
