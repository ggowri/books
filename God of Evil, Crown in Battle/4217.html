        <h1>Chapter 4216</h1>
        <div> - Rematch<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior seems to be very interested in the incomplete maps. I actually have four more,&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly said with a smile on his face.<br>Once he said those words, both the Revered Master Beast Tamer and Grandmaster Tang Chen immediately turned their eyes to him.<br>When they saw what Chu Feng was holding in his hand, they were so shocked that their jaws were almost dropped to the ground.<br>Having experienced the campaign back then, they knew very well how precious the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain&rsquo;s Incomplete Maps were.<br>But Chu Feng, a person of the younger generation, actually had four incomplete maps on him. Adding on to the one that he had lost earlier, it meant that he had a total of five incomplete maps.<br>That was not only more than what the Revered Master Beast Tamer had, it was also more than what Grandmaster Tang Chen had.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, exactly where did you obtain those Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain?&rdquo; Revered Master Beast Tamer asked.<br>The tone that he spoke to Chu Feng with had changed enormously.<br>Of course, he was not being polite toward him out of sincerity. Rather, it was because he was interested in Chu Feng&rsquo;s incomplete maps.<br>He knew extremely well what the Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain represented.<br>&ldquo;Regarding these maps, I encountered an opponent in a remnant.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He wanted to kill me, but was instead killed by me. These incomplete maps were among the possessions he had,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What? Among his possessions?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What was the name of that individual?&rdquo; asked the Revered Master Beast Tamer.<br>Even Grandmaster Tang Chen felt great disbelief toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s story.<br>The people that were able to obtain Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain were all people with status and power.<br>Chu Feng shouldn&rsquo;t be able to kill any of those people.<br>Even if he had grasped rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation, it would still be impossible.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten. It was a nameless person of the younger generation.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng did not tell the truth. But, he didn&rsquo;t lie completely either.<br>A portion of the things that he said were the truth. The Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain were indeed things he had picked up from the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s possessions.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng hadn't known that they were so precious.<br>He had only realized earlier that those incomplete maps were extraordinary items.<br>Revered Master Beast Tamer naturally knew that Chu Feng was not telling the truth.<br>But, he was disinclined to look further into the matter. After all, it didn&rsquo;t really matter how Chu Feng had obtained those incomplete maps.<br>What mattered was that Chu Feng possessed something that he yearned for day and night.<br>&ldquo;In that case, young friend Chu Feng, do you have any more Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain on you?&rdquo; asked Revered Master Beast Tamer.<br>&ldquo;No, these are the only ones left.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng fiddled with the four incomplete maps in his hand as he looked to Revered Master Beast Tamer. &ldquo;Senior, are you willing to have your disciple compete with me again?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We can increase the stake this time around. Let us use four Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain as the gambling stake. What do you say?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Four incomplete maps?&rdquo;<br>Revered Master Beast Tamer was overjoyed upon hearing those words. But, he was also slightly hesitant.<br>Those Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain&rsquo;s Incomplete Maps were simply too precious to him.<br>In the past, he had only possessed two incomplete maps, and had viewed them as treasures.<br>Earlier, he had won another incomplete map from Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>Then, he'd won another from Chu Feng.<br>Right now, he only had four incomplete maps.<br>Even though he felt that his disciple would have a high chance of victory, he also felt that, from Chu Feng&rsquo;s earlier performance, it was possible that he could win too.<br>Hence his hesitance. He was slightly unable to handle the price he would have to pay should he lose to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly be afraid to take this gamble, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you very confident in your disciple?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a provocative tone.<br>&ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you might be young and inexperienced, and not understand how precious the Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain are.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, since your cultivation is too weak, those Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain will not be of any use to you either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;SInce you want to hand those Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain to me to safekeep using this gamble, I will satisfy you.&rdquo;<br>Finally, enticed by four Incomplete Maps of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain, Revered Master Beast Tamer decided to take up Chu Feng&rsquo;s challenge.<br>After all, he felt that his disciple Li Fengxue had a higher chance of victory.<br>But, even though that was the case, he still sent a voice transmission to Li Fengxue to remind him, &ldquo;You must win. You cannot hold back anymore. If you are to lose, I&rsquo;ll punish you thoroughly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master, please rest assured. Give me another chance. I will definitely make him suffer an ugly loss this time around.&rdquo;<br>Compared to his master, Li Fengxue was even more confident.<br>He was surprised by his earlier confrontation with Chu Feng.<br>But, it was also true that he had not gone all-out against him.<br>He was able to equally match with Chu Feng without going all-out against him. Furthermore, he had ultimately won.<br>If he were to go all-out, he felt that there would be no chance of victory for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, the rules shall be the same. If you have no objections, we can begin,&rdquo; Li Fengxue said to Chu Feng.<br>Even though he already knew that Chu Feng was no trash and, contrary to expectations, was stronger than Yuan Shu, he was still filled with confidence and greater enmity.<br>He felt regretful at his inability to instantly defeat Chu Feng.<br>Thus, he wanted to use the opportunity to make up for his regret.<br>&ldquo;Let us begin.&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the two men immediately began setting up their spirit formations.<br>This time around, the two of them both utilized the full amount of time allotted. It was only after the alloted time was reached that the two of them activated their respective spirit formations.<br>&ldquo;Boom---&rdquo;<br>Their spirit formations this time around were much less dazzling than before.<br>But, their destructive powers were much stronger too.<br>Their spirit formations were releasing pure spirit power at each other.<br>Not only was their spirit power radiating with bright light, they were also filled with destructive power.<br>Not to mention being placed in an Ordinary Realm or Lower Realm, this sort of destructive power would even be capable of bringing forth total destruction upon a region in the Upper Realms.<br>Although their confrontation was not as dazzling as before, it was much more mighty and imposing.<br>Seeing their confrontation, Yuan Shu felt himself to be inferior.<br>Although he was also someone that had grasped rank one Dragon Transformation Sensation, he knew very well that there was an enormous disparity between him and them.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?&rdquo;<br>But, once they started attacking with their spirit formations, Li Fengxue began to panic.<br>Earlier, he had been able to defeat Chu Feng without going all-out.<br>This time around he was going all-out. Yet, he was actually feeling a sense of suppression from Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation.<br>Even though they were still in a stalemate, he felt Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation to be simply invulnerable.<br>It was like there was an unbreachable iron bastion blocking his path, rendering him helpless to do anything.<br>&ldquo;Crap!&rdquo;<br>In the following instant, Li Fengxue&rsquo;s expression changed enormously.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks became stronger. Li Fengxue&rsquo;s spirit formation started being suppressed.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation was pushing back Li Fengxue&rsquo;s spirit formation nonstop.<br>If this were to continue, Li Fengxue would definitely lose!<br></p></div>
