        <h1>Chapter 3486</h1>
        <div> - Octaforms Lightning Sealing Formation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What a powerful spirit formation!&rdquo;<br>The crowd all felt disbelief at the spirit formation suppressing Linghu Hongfei.<br>&ldquo;Look! Quickly, look at Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>Soon, someone cried out in alarm.<br>The crowd immediately turned toward Chu Feng. Upon doing so, their expressions all changed as they reached a sudden realization.<br>At that moment, there was a faintly visible cloak on Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>Although that was not the completed appearance, those that had witnessed that cloak before were able to recognize it at a glance. The cloak on Chu Feng was none other than the treasured inheritance of the World Spiritist Immortal King, the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak. Sure enough, Chu Feng is the world spiritist that breached the World Spiritist Immortal King&rsquo;s grand formation and obtained the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.&rdquo;<br>The crowd verified their guesses upon seeing the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.<br>Sure enough, Chu Feng was the youngest Saint-cloak World Spiritist in the history of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>He was also the person who had refused Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan on the Ice Summit that day.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Master!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Grandmaster Long Xuan, Liangqiu Chengfeng, Queen Mother Fox Immortal and Wuming Xingyun all turned their eyes to Grandmaster Liangqiu. Questions filled their gazes.<br>&ldquo;This is truly incredible. Had I not witnessed it myself, this old man would not believe that an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist could set up a spirit formation capable of suppressing a rank two Exalted.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu gasped with admiration. His voice was even trembling slightly. It could be seen that even he was astonished by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;But, even though Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists possess battle power on par with a rank one Exalted, it's only on par with them. It remains very difficult for an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist to defeat a rank one Exalted, much less a rank two Exalted. How is young friend Chu Feng capable of setting up such a powerful spirit formation?&rdquo; Liangqiu Chengfeng asked with an expression of confusion.<br>&ldquo;Perhaps this is the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak. Perhaps it's the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak that has granted young friend Chu Feng the power to contend against a rank two Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that is the case, it would still be impossible for him to suppress a rank two Exalted opponent. Besides, his opponent is Linghu Hongfei, the genius of the younger generations that possesses the strongest battle power and most abundant battle experience of all of them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why he's capable of that feat is due to that grand formation. Young friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s grand formation is truly remarkable. Under the influence of that grand formation, all of Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s power has been sealed. No matter how many abilities and techniques he might possess, he will not be able to unleash them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is truly what it means to gain the initiative by striking first. Young friend Chu Feng has done it beautifully,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;But&hellip; when did he have the time to set up that grand formation?&rdquo; Liangqiu Chengfeng remained confused. He knew that such a grand formation was not something that one could set up at will. It was something that one needed to spend a lot of time setting up.<br>&ldquo;I understand now. It&rsquo;s no wonder he was talking the entire time earlier. So he was actually stalling. Even when he released his spirit power earlier, it was also done to stall for time. That brat managed to keep even us in the dark,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu came to a sudden realization.<br>He had managed to guess what had actually happened.<br>Although he could not be certain as to when exactly, he knew that Chu Feng had begun to set up the grand formation to seal Linghu Hongfei using his concealed spirit power a long time ago. When Chu Feng released an overwhelming amount of dazzling spirit power later on, he was merely doing that to divert the crowd&rsquo;s attention so as to prevent anyone from discovering the things he had done secretly.<br>As for chatting with Linghu Hongfei and Linghu Tiemian, he also did so deliberately to stall for time, so that he could finish setting up that grand formation.<br>&ldquo;That child is truly courageous and insightful. He actually dared to play such a trick before all these experts. Furthermore, he actually managed to successfully deceive all of us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Compared to his father Chu Xuanyuan, this kid seems to be more cunning. That said, this Queen Mother is quite fond of his nature,&rdquo; Queen Mother Fox Immortal showered praises upon Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Let us ignore the fact that he&rsquo;s courageous and insightful for now, and instead shift our attention to the fact that the battle stages have only been established for a very short period of time. Yet, in such a short period of time, he managed to set up such a powerful spirit formation. That child&rsquo;s attainments in terms of world spirit techniques has already surpassed us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As expected of someone that I took a fancy to. He has truly not disappointed me,&rdquo; Grandmaster Long Xuan was also praising Chu Feng nonstop.<br>&ldquo;That spirit formation is extremely remarkable in and of itself. It was likely taught to him by an expert. It&rsquo;s no wonder young friend Chu Feng is unwilling to become my disciple. It would appear that&hellip; he already has a master,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. That spirit formation is truly powerful.&rdquo;<br>Liangqiu Chengfeng and the others also nodded repeatedly after hearing Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s words. They suddenly realized that there was likely an expert teaching Chu Feng already. Otherwise, how could he grasp such powerful spirit formations? After all, such a spirit formation was something that even they did not know.<br>As for the spirit formation that Chu Feng had set up against Linghu Hongfei, it was indeed something taught to him by an expert. As for that expert, his name was Grandmaster Kai Hong.<br>Grandmaster Kai Hong was a legend of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, and once the most powerful expert there.<br>He was someone who had encountered countless opportunities and gained numerous inheritances in his life. Furthermore, he himself was rather talented too.<br>Thus, by relying on the inheritances and opportunities that he had obtained, Grandmaster Kai Hong trained for over twenty thousand years, and reached an age unattainable by the great majority of martial cultivators.<br>However, to Grandmaster Kai Hong, who had obtained countless opportunities in his lifetime, twenty thousand years of age was merely the beginning.<br>Because of the inheritances that he had obtained, he became very different from other martial cultivators.<br>Unfortunately, Grandmaster Kai Hong came across a person, a youngster. Grandmaster Kai Hong ended up being defeated by that youngster. With that one stumble, he was unable to rise again. In the end, he died in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. However, before his death, he left behind everything he had obtained in his life as inheritances.<br>By chance, many years after Grandmaster Kai Hong had died, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong became Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s successors.<br>Furthermore, it should be mentioned that the youngster that had defeated Grandmaster Kai Hong back then was Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandfather, Chu Hanxian.<br>This could really be called &lsquo;being toyed with by fate&rsquo;.<br>However, this was not the important aspect. What was important was that Grandmaster Kai Hong had obtained extraordinary inheritances. However, as his talent was limited, even though he had trained for over twenty thousand years, his strength was still rather weak, and he was unable to unleash the might of many of the spirit formations he had inherited.<br>In fact, even for Chu Feng, there were still a lot of spirit formations that he was unable to unleash.<br>One such example would be the Octoforms Lightning Sealing Formation. It was something that Chu Feng had obtained from Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s inheritance. However, had he not been using the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak, Chu Feng would still not have been able to unleash the power of the spirit formation.<br>Perhaps it was fate.<br>Originally, Chu Feng was simply unable to control the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak. However, during his return from the hidden path of certain death, he discovered that martial comprehension was not the only thing contained on the walls of the channel. It also contained methods for utilizing world spirit techniques.<br>Chu Feng had gained quite a lot of enlightenment from that place. Because of that, he was now able to utilize the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak. Although the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was truly unfathomable, and Chu Feng was only able to utilize a very meager amount of its power, the power that he had gained access to was enough to allow his battle power to increase from being on par with a rank one Exalted to being on par with a rank two Exalted.<br>This was why Chu Feng was confident enough to challenge Linghu Hongfei.<br>Although it was very risky, it would appear that he had succeeded.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, to secretly set up a spirit formation, that&rsquo;s a bit despicable, no?&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei said. The expression of pain remained on his face. In fact, his complexion had even turned pale. Bean-sized beads of sweat were rolling down his face like rain. Even his clothes were completely drenched in sweat.<br>From this, one could see how enormous of a pressure Linghu Hongfei was under.<br>However, even with that being the case, there was still a trace of ridicule in his gaze as he looked to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Despicable?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Compared to your clan&rsquo;s Linghu Tiemian, I don&rsquo;t think what I&rsquo;ve done is worthy of being called despicable at all, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, how are you so certain that I set up my spirit formation secretly? Young master Linghu, one must speak with proof. Otherwise&hellip; it would be an act of framing,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng is truly eloquent with words. I, Linghu Hongfei, am unable to win against you in an argument of words,&rdquo; Linghu Hongfei shook his head. Although he appeared to not have much of a reaction, anger was already burning in his heart. He was so furious that he felt that his heart, liver, spleen and lungs were all about to explode from rage.<br>He had truly never expected that Chu Feng would thwart his plan to publicly teach him a lesson. He had truly never expected to fall by Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands again.<br></p></div>
