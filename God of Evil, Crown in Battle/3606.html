        <div> - The Final Fusion<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, Chu Feng began to carefully size him up.<br>Unfortunately, he was unable to see through the gauze. He could only sense the intense Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura and unfathomable power emitted by the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng was certain that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was an expert from the Ancient Era.<br>&ldquo;This subordinate Zhang Boyi pays his respects to Lord Qin Kunlun.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, I m-m-mean t-t-to say, Lord Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.&rdquo;<br>The three Zhang siblings were actually nervous upon seeing the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>This was especially true for Zhang Boyi. He was so nervous that he said his name incorrectly.<br>Because of that, he was extremely frightened.<br>&ldquo;Lord Demon Exalted, this subordinate is incompetent, and failed to speak your name properly. Lord Demon Exalted, please punish me severely.&rdquo;<br>Zhang Boyi actually voluntarily spoke to request that the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted punish him.<br>He was not feigning chagrin. Instead, he was extremely sincere when he requested punishment.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually not wrong to call this old man Qin Kunlun. Do not mind those things.&rdquo;<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted waved his hand. Then, a gentle breeze landed in the lake and helped the three kneeling Zhang siblings back up.<br>His attitude was very good-natured. Even his tone was very gentle. He did not give off the sort of manner of a person high up and above. Instead, he was more like an amiable old man.<br>Seeing such behavior from the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, Chu Feng&rsquo;s initial impression of him was rather good.<br>Even though his entire body was covered in gauze that made him look very strange, at least his attitude was superb.<br>Although Chu Feng did not kneel to the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, he still bent his back and bowed respectfully. &ldquo;Junior Chu Feng pays his respects to senior.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, this matter is originally unrelated to you. This old man thanks you for being willing to assist me.&rdquo;<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted actually also bowed respectfully back at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please don&rsquo;t do that. Wang Qiang and I are close brothers who have gone through life and death together. Since this matter is related to him, it will also be my concern,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Are all the youngsters now as loyal as you? Truly the people of the younger generation will surpass us old folks in time,&rdquo; the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted laughed.<br>Then, he said to Chu Feng and the others, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk business.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The four of you have managed to fuse with the power of the Void Sacred Tree. However, that is thanks to the formation around the lake. Without the formation, you all might be in some pain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s only after removing the power of the formation that you&rsquo;ll all be able to truly control the power of the Void Sacred Tree. It&rsquo;s only then that you will be able to imbue that power into this old man&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Soon, this old man will remove the power of the formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With that, you will truly be faced with the Sacred Tree&rsquo;s power contained within the lake.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I hope that you can prepare yourselves,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Lord Demon Exalted, this subordinate is already prepared,&rdquo; the three Zhang siblings said with clasped fists in unison.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please go ahead,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Remember, hold firm to your convictions.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted waved his arm.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>The stone obelisks all shattered.<br>After the formation of stone obelisks were destroyed, the lakewater that was originally floating in midair crashed down into the ravine together with Chu Feng and the Zhang siblings.<br>&ldquo;Eeeahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, miserable screams sounded.<br>It was Zhang Yanfeng, Zhang Boyi and Zhang Shirui.<br>The three of them were all clenching their hands into fists and screaming in pain. They were all struggling inside the lake.<br>They seemed like they were about to die.<br>As for Chu Feng, although he did not scream in pain like they did, he was clenching his teeth with an ugly expression on his face. Evidently, he was also enduring some pain.<br>&ldquo;Hold firm to your convictions. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll die.&rdquo;<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s voice sounded again.<br>&ldquo;Die?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Old f-f-f-fart, w-what d-do you mean by t-that?&rdquo; Wang Qiang immediately revealed a look of anger upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s merely the price of the fusion,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Price?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;T-the price is t-t-t-that dangerous? W-w-why didn&rsquo;t yo-you mention it to me e-ea-earlier?&rdquo; Wang Qiang asked angrily.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cultivator yourself, do I need to inform you about something like that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In countless sacred cultivation grounds, cultivators will have to put their lives on the line in order to gain a slight amount of benefits.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ignoring those sacred cultivation grounds far away, let&rsquo;s use the Sacred Palace Hall in the Void Sacred Tree as an example.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are unwilling to take the shortcut, unwilling to refine the souls of others, then you will have to put your own life on the line, use your own life as the price. Only then will you have the opportunity to enter the Sacred Palace Hall.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truth be told, if it wasn&rsquo;t for your brother, those people would&rsquo;ve all died before they entered the Sacred Palace Hall.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, even though they&rsquo;ve managed to reach the Sacred Palace Hall with your brother&rsquo;s help, how much benefit did they truly obtain in the end? Are the benefits that they obtained better than what this lake of mine provides?&rdquo; the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted asked.<br>&ldquo;T-t-this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Wang Qiang had wanted to refute him. However, upon thinking about it, he felt what the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted said to be reasonable.<br>&ldquo;This here will only bring them pain. There is a possibility of death. However, as long as they hold firm to their convictions, they will be fine,&rdquo; the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted added.<br>&ldquo;B-b-but, ev-even if that&rsquo;s the case, y-you should s-still w-w-warn me of it. If I h-h-had known it was t-this d-dangerous, I wouldn&rsquo;t have r-re-requested help from my brother. Y-you a-are making m-me out t-to be an un-unrighteous p-person here.&rdquo;<br>Wang Qiang had a look of self-blame. He was feeling great shame because he was the one who had Chu Feng enter such a dangerous place.<br>&ldquo;Why would you seek to not have his help? This is such a rare cultivation opportunity. Do you wish to make your brother miss out on it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you wish to do that, you won&rsquo;t be helping him. Instead, you&rsquo;ll be harming him,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;B-b-but&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no but. You cannot refuse to allow him to encounter danger just because he&rsquo;s your brother.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to do that, he might remain a weakling his entire life, and be bullied, humiliated and trampled upon by others. What meaning is there if he&rsquo;s to live like that?&rdquo; asked the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>Wang Qiang grew quiet. He was able to understand everything the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted said. He also understood Chu Feng&rsquo;s personality. If he were given the choice, Chu Feng would likely choose danger.<br>However, Wang Qiang was still feeling very bad, still blaming himself. After all, Chu Feng had only decided to enter the lake for the sake of helping him.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough. Don&rsquo;t think too much. Your brother&rsquo;s determination is firm. His determination is very rare. With his conviction and willpower, this will simply not baffle him at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s those three brats that I&rsquo;m worried about. If they are to continue like this, they&rsquo;ll be in danger,&rdquo; the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted turned his gaze to the three Zhang siblings.<br>Seeing that, Wang Qiang also turned his gaze to the lake.<br>It was only then that he discovered what the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted said to be very true.<br>After a short moment of adjustment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression was no longer as ugly as before. Evidently, he was already adapting to the lake.<br>However, the three Zhang siblings were still in miserable pain.<br>This was especially true for Zhang Shirui. The look of pain on her face was growing stronger and stronger. It was like she was on the verge of collapse.<br>Because of that, Wang Qiang felt confused.<br>&ldquo;S-s-strange, my brother is superior to them in all a-aspects. How come t-they managed to make b-breakthroughs in the lake, but my brother d-di-did not?&rdquo; Wang Qiang muttered softly.<br>Even though his voice was very soft, even though he was mumbling to himself, it was still heard by the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted beside him.<br>&ldquo;Who said Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t gain anything from the lake?&rdquo; the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted asked.<br></p></div>
