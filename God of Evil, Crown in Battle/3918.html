        <div> - Parting Ways<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Girl, do you believe me now?&rdquo; Chu Feng look to Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually really the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond. It actually has another entrance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, Grandmaster Yuan Shu is truly powerful. He actually knew this secret that not even we, the Red-dress Holy Land, know. It&rsquo;s no wonder my master respects him so much.&rdquo; Yin Zhuanghong praised nonstop.<br>She had always been filled with confidence in her eyes.<br>In fact, her eyes had astonished Chu Feng on multiple occasions.<br>Yin Zhuanghong had a pair of eyes with even greater power than Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>However, this time around, her eyes had failed her. Yin Zhuanghong had never imagined that beneath the spring water where her eyes were unable to detect any abnormality, there really was another entrance to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond.<br>At the beginning, everything was very normal.<br>However, as Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong continued deeper into the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond, things started becoming abnormal.<br>The narrow tunnel they were traveling through began to expand. At the same time, all sorts of dangerous spirit formations began to appear.<br>Fortunately, Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s eyes regained their usefulness once they'd entered the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond. Thus, she was able to decipher the dangers.<br>Matching Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s eyes with Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques, the two of them surmounted all difficulties, and breached all the hurdles before them.<br>However, at the moment when the two of them were infinitely close to the formation core, a disagreement emerged between them.<br>There were many dozens of entrances before them. Each and every one of them could possibly lead to death.<br>Using her eyes to examine the entrances, Yin Zhuanghong chose the nineteenth entrance.<br>As for Chu Feng, he also used his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to examine the entrances. However, he chose the twenty-seventh entrance.<br>Chu Feng felt that they would need to obtain something first in order to breach the formation core. According to his observations, the twenty-seventh entrance contained that vital item.<br>However, Yin Zhuanghong firmly believed that they should not waste time, and should instead enter the nineteenth entrance.<br>The same sort of disagreement Chu Feng had had with the Mystic Cave Saints in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb occurred between Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Neither of them were able to persuade the other.<br>In the end, they decided to part ways. Yin Zhuanghong decided to enter the nineteenth entrance on her own, whereas Chu Feng decided to proceed for the twenty-seventh entrance on his own.<br>&ldquo;Take this.&rdquo;<br>At the moment when the two of them were about to part ways, Yin Zhuanghong handed a blood-colored ruler to Chu Feng.<br>That blood-colored ruler should be a treasure the Red-dress Holy Land had obtained from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond. In addition to Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s eyes and Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit techniques, the blood-colored ruler had also contributed greatly to their journey.<br>If the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond was a dangerous place, then that ruler was a treasure that could allow one to avoid some dangers.<br>&ldquo;You should keep it. I am able to handle things myself.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled. Then, he turned around and leapt into the twenty-seventh entrance.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng leaving so decisively, Yin Zhuanghong revealed a complicated look.<br>She very much did not want Chu Feng to go into that entrance. She believed the path Chu Feng had chosen to be one that would lead to death.<br>However, she did not hesitate too much. After all, she knew that she shouldered a heavy responsibility of rescuing her seniors ofa<br>the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Thus, Yin Zhuanghong gripped the blood-colored ruler and leapt into the nineteenth entrance.<br>Yin Zhuanghong was extremely cautious. Even though her world spirit techniques were inferior to Chu Feng&rsquo;s, she was able to breach the hurdles in succession with her blood-colored ruler.<br>Furthermore, in the end, she managed to reach the location of the formation core.<br>Not only did she see the formation core, but she also saw that there was a passage behind the formation core. She knew that passage would be able to lead her directly to the place where the elders of the Red-dress Holy Land were trapped.<br>Logically, Yin Zhuanghong should be overjoyed to see the sight before her.<br>However, she showed no sign of joy. Instead, she looked very pained and sad.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, why did you refuse to listen to me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My eyes are never wrong.&rdquo;<br>Yin Zhuanghong gripped the blood-colored ruler tightly. Her arms were trembling.<br>She felt that since she had made the correct choice, Chu Feng must&rsquo;ve chosen wrongly.<br>Although she was very saddened, Yin Zhuanghong knew that she did not have the time to be sad.<br>Thus, she clenched the blood-colored ruler again and began to infuse it with her martial power.<br>This was the amazing aspect of that ruler. One did not need powerful spirit power, for that ruler was capable of transforming one&rsquo;s martial power into spirit power inside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond.<br>&ldquo;Break!&rdquo; Yin Zhuanghong shouted loudly. As if the ruler in her hand was a sharp blade, she swung it at the formation core.<br>Not only had the ruler assimilated with Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s boundless martial power, but it had also assimilated with her aura. Thus, Yin Zhuanghong felt that as long as the ruler could pierce the formation core, she would obtain the power of the formation core.<br>Even if she didn&rsquo;t manage to obtain the power of the formation core, she felt that as long as the ruler could pierce through the formation core, she would be able to go through it and into the passage behind it to rescue her seniors.<br>After rescuing them, she would be able to bring them there and flee using the hidden path.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>However, a scene that surprised her occurred.<br>Her ruler had only just approached the formation core when the giant wall-like formation core became frantic. A sickle-like object was sent out from the formation core. With a light slash, the sickle sliced the ruler in two.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s expression changed enormously after seeing that.<br>She was not only astonished by her failure to pierce through the formation core, but she was also and more so astonished by the ruler being sliced in two.<br>That ruler was their Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s treasure.<br>In the future, they would have to rely on that ruler to open the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Blood Refinement Pond.<br>Yet, the ruler had been sliced in two. How exactly was she supposed to account for that to her master?<br></p></div>
