        <div> - Kill Without Discussion<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>"Ten Souls Pearl? What's that?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"You don't even know about the Ten Souls Pearl?" Chu Lingxi was surprised by Chu Feng's question.<br>"If you don't mind, can you tell me what it is?" Chu Feng said with a smile on his face. Seeing Chu Lingxi's surprised expression, Chu Feng knew that she must know the Ten Souls Pearl very well.<br>Faced with Chu Feng's question, Chu Lingxi sighed helplessly. Then, she asked, "Did your father never mention anything to you before? How come you don't know anything at all?"<br>"I have only met my father once in my entire life. Due to certain circumstances, I was not brought up by my father," Chu Feng said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Lingxi's eyes shifted slightly. She seemed to have understood something.<br>Thus, she asked no more, and no longer tried to ridicule Chu Feng either. Instead, she began to tell Chu Feng about the Ten Souls Pearl.<br>When mentioning the Ten Souls Pearl, one must begin at the site of the Sacred Domain Selection.<br>This place was originally called the Life and Death Treasure Ground. It was constructed through the joint efforts of the Chu Heavenly Clan's Old Ancestor Chu Yetianhong and many powerful world spiritists.<br>Chu Yetianhong hid many treasures in there. One of the most precious treasures was the Ten Souls Pearl.<br>The Ten Souls Pearl would provide enormous assistance to possessors of Heavenly Lightning Bloodlines. This was especially true for people that trained in the Heavenly Punishment Mysterious Technique; they would be able to unleash its power to the pinnacle.<br>However, even after all these years had passed, even though many people of the various generations since then had entered, even though many people had discovered treasures in there, no one had found any trace of the Ten Souls Pearl.<br>Gradually, the treasures grew fewer and fewer. The crowd began to feel that all of the treasures left behind by the Old Ancestor had been retrieved. Because of this, it was no longer a place that people of the younger generation looked forward to entering.<br>That said, due its special construction, it was capable of being used as a special means of selection. Because of that, it was made the place to hold the younger generation's Sacred Domain Selection.<br>Suddenly, Chu Lingxi said, "No, someone discovered the Ten Souls Pearl before,"<br>"Someone discovered the Ten Souls Pearl before? Why would it be here then?" Chu Feng was surprised.<br>"That's because that person said that the Ten Souls Pearl was useless to him. Thus, he put it back."<br>"Because of that, back then and even now, many people felt that that person was boasting," Chu Lingxi said.<br>"Saying that sort of thing would indeed make others think that he's boasting," Chu Feng smiled.<br>"However, I've heard... that person seems to be your grandfather," Chu Lingxi said.<br>"......"<br>Hearing those words, black lines immediately ran down Chu Feng's forehead. He thought to himself, 'seems like my grandfather is also one to not travel the normal road.'<br>However, upon finding out that it was his grandfather, Chu Feng hurriedly said, "Then that's definitely not boasting then."<br>"You're quite confident in your grandfather," Chu Lingxi said.<br>"My confidence originates from my blood," Chu Feng said.<br>"Actually, I really didn't believe it before. However, I believe it now," Chu Lingxi said.<br>"Why's that?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"After all, you've also found this place, no?" Chu Lingxi said.<br>"In that case, it would mean that this Ten Souls Pearl is useless for my Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique?" There were two reasons why Chu Feng asked this question.<br>Chu Lingxi had mentioned that the Ten Souls Pearl was helpful toward possessors of Heavenly Lightning Bloodlines. However, they must have trained in the Self-Punishment Mysterious Technique, and fused with their Self-Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>The Ten Souls Pearl would be enormously helpful for both people that trained in the Mortal Punishment Mysterious Technique and Earthen Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>As for people who practiced Heavenly Punishment Mysterious Techniques, they would be able to unleash the power of the Ten Souls Pearl to the extreme. However, she did not mention the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>However, Chu Feng's grandfather had once obtained the Ten Souls Pearl, yet ended up returning it to its original place. This very possibly illustrated that the Ten Souls Pearl was useless for users of the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.<br>"Regarding this... I am uncertain. However, your grandfather said one thing before. Do you wish to know what he said?" Chu Lingxi asked.<br>"Naturally," Chu Feng said.<br>"I only heard about this myself. I am not certain as to whether it was really said by your grandfather. However, according to rumors, your grandfather said, 'The Ten Souls Pearl is unqualified to fuse with the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique,'" Chu Lingxi said.<br>"Those words sound like something my grandfather said," Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>"You've met your grandfather before?" Chu Lingxi asked.<br>"Of course not," Chu Feng said.<br>"Then why are you acting like you know your grandfather's character?" Chu Lingxi asked.<br>"That's because he's my grandfather," Chu Feng said with a beaming smile. Then, he cast his gaze to the Ten Souls Pearl below. "It seems like you want to obtain it very much. I will help you."<br>"You&rsquo;ll help me? That Ten Souls Pearl is not that easily obtainable. Do you see those ten guardian beasts? Have a feel of their strength. We are no match for them. Unless our cultivation reaches the Heavenly Immortal Realm, we are simply unable to defeat them. As long as we&rsquo;re unable to defeat them, we will not be able to obtain the Ten Souls Pearl.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, that doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore. After all, I now know where the Ten Souls Pearl is located. Furthermore, I will definitely become a Heavenly Immortal before I turn one hundred. It would be the same for me to return and retrieve it at that time,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>&ldquo;We are clearly able to retrieve it now, why must we wait till then?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Do you not understand what I just said? We are not capable of retrieving that Ten Souls Pearl right now,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, what if I manage to retrieve it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You have a way to retrieve it?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi was very surprised. However, Chu Feng was not acting like he was joking. Thus, she said, &ldquo;Let me remind you that if something is to happen to you, do not implicate me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would do for you to just stay here and watch,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he left his spirit formation. Then, he followed the undercurrent and continued to approach the Ten Souls Pearl.<br>Seemingly sensing that someone had approached, the guardian beasts guarding the Ten Souls Peal all unleashed their boundless auras.<br>Most frighteningly of all, they had already opened their enormous eyes that were filled with murderous desire and staring at Chu Feng.<br>Their gazes were simply too frightening. It was as if they were warning Chu Feng that if he dared to come any closer, they would kill him without discussion.<br><br><br></p></div>
