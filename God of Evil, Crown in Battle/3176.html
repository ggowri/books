        <h1>Chapter 3175</h1>
        <div> - Monster Bai Liluo<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Since everyone already knows what&rsquo;s going on, we might as well tell it as it is. From today on, our Dongguo Heavenly Clan will reinstate our alliance with the Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If anyone dares touch the Chu Heavenly Clan, it will be akin to making an enemy out of our Dongguo Heavenly Clan. Our Dongguo Heavenly Clan will absolutely not be willing to take things lying down.&rdquo;<br>The elder of the Mighty Dongguo Duo spoke with a very resounding voice.<br>His tone was filled with deterrence.<br>Sure enough, after he said those words, apart from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, all the other powers present, including the Burnfield Monstrous Clan, which possessed enormous hatred for Chu Feng, revealed a change in expression. To a greater or lesser degree, fear had appeared in their eyes.<br>If it were only the Chu Heavenly Clan, they would naturally not be afraid. However, if the Dongguo Heavenly Clan were to back the Chu Heavenly Clan, they would have to reconsider things.<br>After all, the Dongguo Heavenly Clan, the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan and the Soulseeker Church were three publicly accepted strongest powers of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s Eastern Region.<br>As such, the Dongguo Heavenly Clan was not at all weaker than the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan. It was only natural for powers of the Burnfield Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s caliber to not dare to make an enemy out of the Dongguo Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Succeeded. Little brother Chu Feng actually succeeded. I knew that the Dongguo Heavenly Clan would definitely be willing to reconcile with us should little brother Chu Feng go and talk with them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re saved now. No wonder little brother Chu Feng was so confident.&rdquo;<br>Chu Ping was extremely excited.<br>It was not only him; the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen were also acting extremely excited.<br>They all knew very well how powerful the Dongguo Heavenly Clan was. In the past, when they were being protected by the Dongguo Heavenly Clan, who would possibly dare to bully their Chu Heavenly Clan?<br>And now, the Dongguo Heavenly Clan had voiced their intention to protect their Chu Heavenly Clan again. With this, who would dare to bully them again?<br>Furthermore, the intention behind the elder of the Mighty Dongguo Duo&rsquo;s words was extremely clear. He stated that they would be reinstating their alliance. The word &lsquo;alliance&rsquo; showed how much importance the Dongguo Heavenly Clan attached to the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Although the Burnfield Monstrous Clan and those other powers present all adhered to the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, they were merely subsidiary powers, subordinates under the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.<br>However, their Chu Heavenly Clan was different. Although they would be dependent on the protection of the Dongguo Heavenly Clan, they were allies of equal standing.<br>In terms of status, their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s status was completely different from that of the Burnfield Monstrous Clan and the others.<br>Overjoyed, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen all turned their gazes toward Chu Feng. They all knew very well that the Dongguo Heavenly Clan was only willing to put their Chu Heavenly Clan under their protection again because of Chu Feng.<br>That being said, not all the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were feeling joyous. Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys currently had very displeased expressions on their faces.<br>They were naturally displeased. After all, as long as the Dongguo Heavenly Clan was willing to protect Chu Feng, it would be much more difficult for them to take care of him.<br>Suddenly, Qingyu Yunlong shouted, &ldquo;So what if it&rsquo;s the Dongguo Heavenly Clan?! Today, I am determined to teach that Chu Feng a lesson! I will teach whoever it is that dares to stop me a lesson too!&rdquo;<br>Following that, Qingyu Yunlong and Qingyu Yunhu both soared into the air and began to fly in Chu Feng&rsquo;s direction.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite arrogant. Why don&rsquo;t you give it a try?&rdquo;<br>The Mighty Dongguo Duo were not to be outdone. Their bodies shifted, and they began to fly toward the Dragon and Tiger Brothers.<br>In the blink of an eye, the four Martial Immortal experts collided in battle.<br>&ldquo;Boom, boom, boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Rumbles began to sound all over as energy ripples scattered about. The destruction from the battle of the four Martial Immortals was extremely frightening.<br>However, as the four of them battled, Chu Feng was able to tell that even though they were all Martial Immortals, and when disregarding all their various techniques, their actual cultivations were only at rank one Martial Immortal.<br>The two parties could be said to be long-term rivals.<br>As such, neither party held back, and unleashed their strongest abilities from the very start.<br>After fighting for some time, the two parties were actually locked in a stalemate.<br>It was no wonder the Mighty Dongguo Duo would be equally as famous as the Dragon and Tiger Brothers.<br>Seeing that they were unable to get past the Mighty Dongguo Duo, the Dragon and Tiger Brothers pulled back their attacks and returned to their Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen.<br>Seeing the two of them retreat, the Mighty Dongguo Duo did not pursue them. However, they revealed pleased smiles on their faces.<br>No matter what, it was the Dragon and Tiger Brothers that had pulled back first.<br>&ldquo;Qingyu Yunlong, no matter how much you want to take care of Chu Feng, as long as we brothers are here, your Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan can forget about touching a single hair on his head,&rdquo; the elder of the Mighty Dongguo Duo said complacently.<br>&ldquo;What did you say? As long as the two of you are here, our Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan will not be able to touch a single hair on his head?&rdquo; Qingyu Yunlong asked.<br>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; the elder of the Mighty Dongguo Duo said.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, I must have you know whether or not you, Mighty Dongguo Duo, will actually be able to stop us should our Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan insist on attacking Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>After Qingyu Yunlong finished saying those words, he suddenly turned around and bowed. At the same time, he said, &ldquo;Miss Liluo, it would appear that we&rsquo;ll have to trouble you this time around.&rdquo;<br>&hellip;...<br>Once Qingyu Yunlong said those words, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed. Not to mention the others, even the Mighty Dongguo Duo were unable to remain calm.<br>The Mighty Dongguo Duo looked to one another. A trace of panic appeared in their eyes.<br>They naturally knew who Bai Liluo was. She was the monster whose name could shake the entire Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s Eastern Region.<br>If the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan had truly managed to request the assistance of Bai Liluo, it would not only be detrimental to the Chu Heavenly Clan, it would be detrimental to even their Dongguo Heavenly Clan.<br>In the end, it was the Dongguo Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s elder brother who managed to compose himself. He asked, &ldquo;I have heard that your Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan has been trying to invite Bai Liluo to join your Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan. Could it be&hellip; you all succeeded?&rdquo;<br>The elder of the Mighty Dongguo Duo asked those words for the sake of verifying the matter.<br>After all, if Bai Liluo had truly joined the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, their Dongguo Heavenly Clan would have to prepare themselves for her.<br>&ldquo;Succeeded? Did you not understand what was said?&rdquo;<br>QIngyu Yunhu let out a mocking laugh at the elder Mighty Dongguo Duo&rsquo;s question. He said, &ldquo;Not only has Miss Liluo become our Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s guest elder, but she is also here right now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bai Liluo&hellip; is here?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the crowd all burst into an uproar. The Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s subsidiary powers were all astonished, whereas the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were all frightened.<br>Bai Liluo&rsquo;s reputation was well known. She was so frightening that even the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan would have to yield to her.<br>At that moment, even the Mighty Dongguo Duo grew uneasy.<br>The reason for that was purely because Bai Liluo was too powerful.<br>At that moment, the crowd began to discuss this matter spiritedly. Through the crowd&rsquo;s conversations, Chu Feng learned that Bai Liluo was a very frightening character.<br>That said, compared to the alarm and astonishment from the crowd, Chu Feng entered deep contemplation.<br>The reason for that was because he felt that the name Bai Liluo sounded very familiar. He seemed to have heard it somewhere before.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze changed. He recalled the white-haired little girl he ran into in the cave. Her name seemed to be Bai Liluo.<br></p></div>
