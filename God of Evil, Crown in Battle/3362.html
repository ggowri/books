        <div> - The Way Of The Overlord<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Milord?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng opened his eyes and was unable to contain his surprise upon discovering that it was Wuming Fenghuo who was healing his injuries.<br>He truly never imagined that such a grand individual who stood high and above would personally heal his injuries.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Lord Wuming Fenghuo deliberately stayed to treat your injuries. Quickly, thank him,&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng stepped forward and said to Chu Feng.<br>It was not only Chu Hanpeng. Chu Xuanzhengfa was also present. Of course&hellip; Bai Liluo was also present.<br>&ldquo;Thank you Milord,&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly got up and bowed respectfully to Wuming Fenghuo.<br>Although the injuries he had received from the Heavenly Lightning were not critical, he knew very well that it was all thanks to Wuming Fenghuo that he was able to recover from his injuries so quickly.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s merely a trifling matter. Since you&rsquo;re fine, you don&rsquo;t have to stand on ceremony,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo smiled. His attitude was very good-natured.<br>Seeing that, Chu Hanpeng, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the other Chu Heavenly Clansmen looked to one another. Uncontainable joy was present on their faces.<br>Wuming Fenghuo seemed to think very highly of Chu Feng. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have personally treated his injuries.<br>To be able to gain the good impression of a grand character like Wuming Fenghuo was not only a good thing for Chu Feng, but it was a good thing for the entire Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng also stood up straight. It was only then that he discovered he was in a special palace, one that was especially used for treating injuries.<br>Not far from Chu Feng was a spirit formation. Inside that spirit formation lay a person: the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Has Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s poison still not been removed?&rdquo; Chu Feng was surprised. The reason for that was because the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s situation seemed much more serious than when he saw him that day when he was poisoned. He simply&hellip; seemed like someone on the verge of death.<br>&ldquo;Big sister Liluo, what is going on?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s first reaction was to look to Bai Liluo. He thought that there was an issue with her antidote.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault. I&rsquo;ve made the antidote, but they refused to feed it to your clan chief,&rdquo; Bai Liluo was sitting on a vase in the distance. She shrugged her shoulders as she kicked her feet back and forth.<br>&ldquo;Senior, why do you all refuse to feed Lord Clan Chief the antidote?&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to Chu Hanpeng and the others.<br>&ldquo;Ehh~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, is that &lsquo;big sister&rsquo; of yours reliable?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, she was the one who poisoned Lord Clan Chief in the first place. Yet now, she&rsquo;s planning to give him the antidote. Furthermore, no matter how we inspected the antidote, it still seemed like poison,&rdquo; Chu Hanpeng spoke with a low voice.<br>&ldquo;The hell do you all know? That&rsquo;s called curing poison with poison.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If ordinary people are to drink this antidote of mine, they will definitely die from its poison. However, should your clan chief drink it, the two poisons will counteract one another, allowing the poison within his body to be removed. With that, he will slowly recover,&rdquo; Bai Liluo felt very displeased, and her attitude was very bad. She even cursed at Chu Hanpeng.<br>To her, apart from Chu Feng, there was no one else present that was worthy of her respect.<br>Faced with such behavior from Bai Liluo, Chu Hanpeng felt helpless. He had attempted to determine Bai Liluo&rsquo;s cultivation when Chu Feng was unconscious, and ended up discovering that the little girl&rsquo;s cultivation was unfathomable.<br>At the very least, he was no match for her.<br>&ldquo;If something is to happen, I will shoulder the responsibility,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Chu Hanpeng and the others.<br>Then, he arrived before Bai Liluo, &ldquo;Big sister Liluo, give me the antidote.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Here, take it. Don&rsquo;t worry, this antidote of mine is absolutely effective,&rdquo; Bai Liluo took out the antidote and handed it to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I trust you,&rdquo; Chu Feng accepted the antidote. Then, he arrived before the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and slowly poured the antidote into his mouth.<br>Seeing that, Chu Hanpeng and the others began to worry. However, they did not stop Chu Feng.<br>They were also very worried about the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. After all, they were unable to remove the poison, and if they were to continue to drag out the matter, their Lord Clan Chief would undoubtedly die.<br>They even went as far as to ask for Wuming Fenghuo&rsquo;s assitance. Unfortunately, Wuming Fenghuo said that he was powerless to help them.<br>Although Bai Liluo&rsquo;s antidote seemed very unreliable, there must be a reason why Chu Feng trusted her. At that moment, they had no choice but to gamble.<br>&ldquo;Wuuu~~~&rdquo;<br>To the crowd&rsquo;s delight, not long after the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was fed the antidote, he showed a reaction, and the poisonous aura that covered his body started to slowly dissipate. Furthermore, he even managed to open his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief!&rdquo;<br>The crowd immediately rushed forth and surrounded the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Feng&rsquo;er.&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did not bother to pay attention to the crowd. Instead, he grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s wrist.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, the one who poisoned you was not Chu Feng. It was someone else. It was Chu Hanqing and Chu Hanyouyou. They, for the sake of eliminating Chu Feng, decided&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Say no more,&rdquo; the crowd wanted to explain things to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and help him redress this injustice. However, before they could finish, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief waved his hand, &ldquo;Although I was unable to move during the time that I was poisoned, I was not really unconscious. I heard all of their conversations. Thus, I know what happened.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the crowd no longer worried about Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Feng&rsquo;er, I have something that I need to speak with you about,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said to Chu Feng with a soft voice.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please speak away,&rdquo; Chu Feng placed his ear beside the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s mouth.<br>Although the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had awakened, his body was still very weak. He did not even have the strength to stand.<br>After Chu Feng approached, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said to Chu Feng through voice transmission, &ldquo;The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and I are close friends of many years. I have been worried about the matter regarding the Wuma Heavenly Clan the entire time. However, I am powerless to help them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Wuming Fenghuo is one of the Starfield Master Realm&rsquo;s Ten Great Experts. Both in terms of status and strength, he is capable of stopping the wicked conduct of the Wuma Branch Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Wuming Fenghuo seems to be very fond of you. As such, I will have to trouble you with mentioning this request. If you are to request his assistance, he might be willing to help.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will not concern myself with the matter,&rdquo; right at that moment, a voice transmission was suddenly heard.<br>The crowd were all startled. Especially Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Astonishment filled their faces.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had clearly used a voice transmission to speak with Chu Feng. Yet, it seemed that Wuming Fenghuo had heard all of it.<br>&ldquo;Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, I&rsquo;m afraid that I will not be able to help you in regards with the matter regarding the Wuma Heavenly Clan. Regardless of whether it is you or Chu Feng who asks for my help, I will still not involve myself with that matter,&rdquo; sure enough, Wuming Fenghuo had heard the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;Milord, why do you all remain indifferent to that sort of thing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the Starfield Master Realm the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield? Are you all not going to do anything when something like that happens?&rdquo; Chu Feng stood up and questioned Wuming Fenghuo.<br>&ldquo;Feng&rsquo;er, do not be rude.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that Chu Feng actually dared to directly question Wuming Fenghuo, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Chu Hanpeng, Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others all started to frown. They were all extremely worried.<br>Although Wuming Fenghuo appeared to be very good-natured, they all knew very well that he was one of the Starfield Master Realm&rsquo;s Ten Great Experts. Before someone like him, one could not act rude. Otherwise, one might encounter great danger.<br>Faced with the nervous crowd, Wuming Fenghuo smiled and waved his hand to indicate to them that he was not angry.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, the first half of what you said is very correct. Our Starfield Master Realm is indeed the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. However, the latter half of what you said is incorrect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As the overlord, it would do as long as everyone knows of our status and position. We do not possess any obligation to concern ourselves with grudges between various clans and powers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we are to concern ourselves with them, it would be because of our own affection. If we refuse to concern ourselves, it would also be reasonable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is the way of being an overlord,&rdquo; Wuming Fenghuo said to Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
