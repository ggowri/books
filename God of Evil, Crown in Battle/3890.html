        <div> - The Powerful Heavenly Exalted<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Tuoba Chengan, you shouldn&rsquo;t have attacked my friends.&rdquo; Chu Feng turned his gaze to Tuoba Chengan.<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s sharp and killing intent-filled gaze, even Tuoba Chengan&rsquo;s heart tensed up.<br>He was actually scared.<br>He, the Supreme Elder of the All-heaven Sect, a peak expert that stood above tens of thousands of people and below only a single person, actually felt fear towards a person of the younger generation.<br>Even he himself found it unbelievable.<br>However, he had no choice but to accept it.<br>He was able to tell that the power Chu Feng currently possessed was something that he couldn&rsquo;t possibly contend against.<br>At such a time, he truly wanted to shout to Chu Feng that it was clearly the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted who had attacked the Mystic Cave Saints, and not him.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly attacked.<br>Chu Feng raised his hand and shot forth a palm. The power that covered him rushed from his body like a massive tide that broke through a dam.<br>Once that power rushed forth, it turned into a giant palm. That palm was as massive as a mountain.<br>That enormous palm streaked across the sky and caused even space itself to tremble violently.<br>Such a terrifying giant palm of energy was making a straight line for Tuoba Chengan.<br>The instant the people from the All-heaven Sect saw that enormous palm of energy, they all turned pale with fear, and were frightened completely stiff.<br>They were all able to sense how terrifying that enormous energy palm was. That enormous energy palm possessed enough power to obliterate all of them.<br>It was&hellip; all of them!!!<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>However, all of a sudden, a loud explosion was heard.<br>That powerful and massive palm of energy actually scattered apart into energies. Like a golden ocean, the majestic energies blossomed in the sky.<br>It was blood-red gaseous flames!<br>At that moment, blood-red gaseous flames were spiraling before the enormous energy palm.<br>It was the blood-red gaseous flames that had scattered Chu Feng&rsquo;s enormous energy palm.<br>The gaseous flames had come from the horsetail whisk the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted held in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Brat, don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re the only one who obtained the power of this place&rsquo;s spirit formation," said the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted to Chu Feng.<br>After saying those words, Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted turned to Tuoba Chengan. &ldquo;Elder Tuoba, the following battle might not be something that you all can bear.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, you should leave this place first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although the power of the spirit formation this child had obtained is extremely powerful, it can only be utilized within the vicinity of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you all are to keep your distance from this place, he will not be able to cause any harm to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he is to leave this place, he will end up losing the spirit formation&rsquo;s power, and will no longer be able to contend against you. Thus, he will not dare to chase after you,&rdquo; the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted said to Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;Heavenly Exalted, in that case, we&rsquo;ll have to trouble you with the situation here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should you be able to take care of this child and retrieve our treasures, we can increase the rewards.&rdquo;<br>Tuoba Chengan immediately turned to leave after saying those words.<br>He actually really fled with the people of the All-heaven Sect.<br>Furthermore, from their sorry appearances as they fled, one could tell that the people from the All-heaven Sect simply did not dare believe that their army of elites would be scared witless by a person of the younger generation.<br>That said, although they were fleeing in dismay, Chu Feng did not plan to let them get away.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think you can flee!&rdquo; he shouted.<br>With that, his overwhelming power was once again released from his body.<br>This time around, his power turned into a magnificent army of thousands of men and horses that rushed forth to chase after Tuoba Chengan and the others.<br>&ldquo;Bang, bang, bang~~~&rdquo;<br>However, that magnificent army exploded in midair.<br>Countless blood-red arrows had shot through the magnificent army.<br>It was that Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted again.<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had blocked Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack again.<br>And, during this short period of time, Tuoba Chengan and the others from the All-heaven Sect had disappeared into the distance.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re truly courting death!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng looked to the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted with killing intent-filled eyes.<br>However, facing the killing intent-filled Chu Feng, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted showed no sign of fear. Instead, he laughed strangely.<br>&ldquo;Go ahead and show me what sort of ability you possess.&rdquo;<br>Then, Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted waved his horsetail whisk again.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>In an instant, boundless blood-red gaseous flames emerged from before him like a massive tide. Then, like an army of hundreds of millions, with ear-piercing roars and oppressive might akin to the ruler of the entire region, the blood-red gaseous flames flew straight towards Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng let out a cold snort.<br>Then, boundless golden bodies of light charged towards the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>In an instant, the golden bodies of light and blood-red gaseous flames collided with each other.<br>The energy ripples unleashed by their collision were extremely fierce.<br>Even though Tuoba Chengan and others had fled over ten thousand miles away, they were still able to witness the dazzling light caused by the energy ripples, which expanded nonstop.<br>However, strangely, even though the energy ripples were extremely terrifying, and were clearly capable of extending for over ten thousand miles, submerging where Tuoba Chengan and others were, the energy ripples began to dissipate without spreading far at all.<br>Furthermore, they dissipated in an instant.<br>It seemed like they reached a boundary upon reaching a certain point, and were instantly engulfed by some sort of power.<br>Because of that, the powerful energy ripples completely disappeared upon reaching a certain range outside the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that what Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted said is true.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although that Asura has obtained enormous power from that spirit formation, and can even kill this old man easily, that spirit formation&rsquo;s power is limited to a certain range. He is only able to utilize that power within the vicinity of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.&rdquo; Tuoba Chengan gasped.<br>&ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, how could that Asura obtain such overwhelming power?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The power displayed by the Mystic Cave Saints earlier should also be the power of the spirit formation, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But their power was far inferior to that child&rsquo;s. Could it be that that child is truly so powerful that even the Mystic Cave Saints are inferior to him?&rdquo; asked an elder of the All-heaven Sect.<br>He was showing signs of fear as he asked those questions. He was beginning to fear Chu Feng&rsquo;s power.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that he was a coward. It was simply that he felt death when confronted with the power Chu Feng had unleashed at them earlier.<br>He felt that should that palm strike have landed on them, all of them would be killed. Even Tuoba Chengan would not be able to save them.<br>In other words, had it not been for the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted being present, they would&rsquo;ve died already.<br>Even their Lord Supreme Elder Tuoba Chengan would have died already.<br>&ldquo;That child is indeed quite capable. After all, he has already defeated the Mystic Cave Saints in the Red-dress Holy Land. Thus, it is not at all surprising for him to obtain such overwhelming power in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, this is good news for us too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That child is still alone. The Mystic Cave Saints were merely bluffing by pretending to be his subordinates.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All of this illustrates that that child, although possessed of exceptional talent and extraordinary abilities, might really not be supported by any power or powerful individual.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With this, we will be able to be at ease against him,&rdquo; said Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;What Lord Supreme Elder said is extremely correct.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But&hellip; exactly who is that Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How come he&rsquo;s so powerful?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would be understandable if that Asura and the Mystic Cave Saints had come to the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb ahead of us, and seized a decisive opportunity through special means.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, that Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted clearly came here with us. He shouldn&rsquo;t have set foot into that Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb before that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, why would he also say that he has gained the power of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb&rsquo;s spirit formation?&rdquo; asked an elder of the All-heaven Sect.<br>&ldquo;Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted is a genius world spiritist. Attainments in world spirit techniques at his caliber are rarely seen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, his Bloodjade Horsetail Whisk is a treasure from the Ancient Era. Reportedly, it is a treasure from a top world spiritist from the Ancient Era.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, regardless of what sort of remnant it might be, as long as he can enter it, he will be able to obtain the power of that remnant&rsquo;s spirit formation through the Bloodjade Horsetail Whisk, and become the ruler of that remnant.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is also the reason why I&rsquo;m willing to pay such a high price to request his help.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, this price is truly a bit too high.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it is evidently very worth it too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The ability of the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted is truly worthy of us spending that enormous sum to request his help,&rdquo; said Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;<br>The All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s elders all nodded at Tuoba Chengan&rsquo;s words.<br>They&rsquo;d all personally witnessed the ability of the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>He had fully won them over with how powerful he was.<br>In fact, they even felt that as long as the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was present, even if Asura had obtained the power of the spirit formation, he would still ultimately be defeated.<br>Right at that moment, an elder cried out in alarm, &ldquo;Lord Supreme Elder, it seems that Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted is being suppressed!&rdquo;<br></p></div>
