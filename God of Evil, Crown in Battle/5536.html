Feng </span><span>Jiuyue</span><span> also dispelled the concealment formation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;How are you feeling, Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked aloud.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you the one playing tricks with me, Chu Feng? Are you behind this?!&rdquo; Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> bellowed furiously.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>, this is not something I am capable of. Your current plight is the doing of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master. This place isn&rsquo;t a tempering formation at all but a huge assimilation formation. Your Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clan, the Totem Dragon Clan, and the Totem Phoenix Clan are tributes the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master has prepared for this assimilation formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Impossible! That can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> initially refused to believe it, and fury soon seeped into his eyes. He was starting to waver because he could feel his body getting assimilated.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic, Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>. I can save you. Tell me where your clansmen are residing. Are they following the orders of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, our Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clan was nearly destroyed by the Totem Dragon Clan and Totem Phoenix Clan back then. It was the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion that saved our ancestors. They fabricated the evidence of our death, leading the Totem Dragon Clan and Totem Phoenix Clan to believe that the Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clan has gone extinct. In truth, we have been residing in a mobile ancient city, which has come to the Immemorial Star Sea. Chu Feng, I can&rsquo;t take it anymore. I&rsquo;ll tell you everything you want to. Please, save me first!&rdquo; Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>, I can&rsquo;t trust you. Give me all your treasures first as a symbol of sincerity,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Here, take it all! I&rsquo;ll even give you my God Armament! I have already assimilated all of my clansmen, so they can&rsquo;t enhance my fighting prowess anymore. Without my </span><span>God Armament, I won&rsquo;t be a match for Long Chengyu. You don&rsquo;t need to fear me anymore!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Despite the excruciating pain, Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> threw out his God Armament, Cosmos Sack, and all of his treasures. Chu Feng grabbed all of the items with a swipe of his hand.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Save me, Chu Feng! I can&rsquo;t hold on for much longer.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> wasn&rsquo;t lying. Those standing outside the formation core could see Qi </span><span>Weidao&rsquo;s</span><span> flesh blazing away. He would die at this rate.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>, I am a man of my word, but only to those I deem worthy. As for you&hellip; My apologies, I lied. I can&rsquo;t save you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You bastard, Chu Feng! I&rsquo;ll kill you! I&rsquo;ll kill you! I haunt you even as a ghost! I&rsquo;m going to&hellip; GAH!&rdquo; Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span> let out a pitiful cry as waves of blood-red aura flowed out from him and fused into the formation core.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That is&hellip; They seem to be the Blood-eyed </span><span>Qilin</span><span> Clansmen hiding inside Qi </span><span>Weidao&rsquo;s</span><span> body. Aren&rsquo;t they already dead? Are they going to be assimilated by the formation too?&rdquo; Feng </span><span>Jiuyue</span><span>, as a Royal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, was able to immediately see through the details.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just those who have died inside Qi </span><span>Weidao&rsquo;s</span><span> body. Even those who have been reduced to ashes will have their bloodline assimilated by the formation. The power of this formation is not at a level we can comprehend. That&rsquo;s why it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you have killed each other or not, for the assimilation formation can use even those who have died,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What a frightening formation. Chu Feng, how do we escape from here?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The crowd was frightened after witnessing the horrors of the formation core.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to the compass in his hand.</span><br><span>Weng </span><span>weng</span><span> </span><span>weng</span><span>!</span><br><span>The compass and the formation core began vibrating intensely.</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clansmen and Totem Phoenix Clansmen were horrified.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; Chu Feng calmly said.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>The formation core suddenly expanded at an unbelievable speed, enveloping the entire realm in the blink of an eye. All of a sudden, the realm resembled a living hell, though Chu Feng and the others remained safe.</span><br><span>They were protected by a special defensive formation that contained two spirit formation gates. The energy from the assimilation energy furiously attacked the defensive formation like a ravenous wolf, but the defensive formation wasn&rsquo;t fazed in the least.</span><br><span>This defensive formation was manifested by the compass.</span><br><span>Earlier, as Chu Feng channeled the formation to aid Long Chengyu in his battle against Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>, his mind was still focused on deciphering the compass. It was only after he organized all of the clues that the truth slowly surfaced, granting him the knowledge he needed to activate the compass.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, you have our deepest gratitude for saving our lives.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Some of the Totem Phoenix Clansmen kneeled on the floor with tears flowing from </span><span>their eyes. Following them, more and more people kneeled to Chu Feng, including those from the Totem Dragon Clan. Many of them even burst out crying.</span><br><span>They knew that they would have died here if not for Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Stand up. I didn&rsquo;t do this just to save you. It&rsquo;s for my own sake too,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>With a wave of his sleeves, he supported them back to their feet, but those people kneeled before him once more.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, I am truly sorry. I was ignorant and foolish. I doubted your capabilities and even insulted you. I deserve to die!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Some of them even began slapping themselves.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I, Feng </span><span>Tiansheng</span><span>, was too arrogant. I&hellip; I am sorry.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Even Feng </span><span>Tiansheng</span><span> also walked up to Chu Feng and gave himself two tight slaps that distorted his face.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Enough. Don&rsquo;t you find it embarrassing?&rdquo; Feng </span><span>Jiuyue</span><span> bellowed.</span><br><span>It was only then that the crowd reined themselves in.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I shan&rsquo;t say anything excessive. Let&rsquo;s have a hearty drink once we get out of here,&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Definitely,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a grin.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you going drinking? Brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;d like to drink with you too. Bring me along.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Feng </span><span>Tiansheng</span><span> burst into tears, such that his voice sounded a little hoarse as he spoke. It was hard to tell whether he was relieved that he had escaped an ordeal or that he bitterly regretted what he had done.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind if Brother Chengyu doesn&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What do I have to mind if Brother Chu Feng doesn&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo; Long Chengyu replied with a casual smile.</span><br><span>&ldquo;All right! I&rsquo;ll tell my father to bring out his cherished Bloodline True Wine!&rdquo; Feng </span><span>Tiansheng</span><span> wiped off his tears as he said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll get my father&rsquo;s cherished top-quality Dragon Spring!&rdquo; Long Chengyu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Top-quality Dragon Spring? Are you talking about the Dragon Breath Spring Chamber&rsquo;s Dragon Spring?&rdquo; Feng </span><span>Tiansheng</span><span> asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Indeed, but the one we have is different from the ones sold at the Dragon breath Spring Chamber,&rdquo; Long Chengyu replied with a smirk.</span><br><span>Feng </span><span>Tiansheng&rsquo;s</span><span> eyes lit up. &ldquo;Chengyu, can I have a taste too?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course. We&rsquo;re already going to drink together!&rdquo; Long Chengyu replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Brother Chengyu, you are a generous man. You should have a taste of our Bloodline True Wine too. That&rsquo;s brewed with a treasure we uncovered in an ancient remnant. The taste is guaranteed to satisfy even the pickiest connoisseur,&rdquo; Feng </span><span>Tiansheng</span><span> replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is that so? I&rsquo;ll have to give it a try then!&rdquo; Long Chengyu said expectantly.</span><br><span>Long </span><span>Muxi</span><span> shook her head. It was not too long ago that they were crossing blows with each other, but before they knew it, they were already asking each other out for drinks. Sometimes, the friendship between men was that whimsical.</span><br><span>As easy as it was for two men who disagreed with each other to come to blows, it was </span><span>also equally easy for them to become friends once they found common ground. Of course, that was assuming that they were decent, unlike those like Qi </span><span>Weidao</span><span>.</span><br><span>Weng!</span><br><span>Noises suddenly echoed from the two spirit formation gates inside the protective formation, as if reminding the crowd of their existence.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Speaking of which, Brother Chu Feng, why are there two gates?&rdquo; Long Chengyu asked.</span><br><span>Chu Feng pointed to the left door and said, &ldquo;That spirit formation gate brings us back to the outer perimeter of the Immemorial Star Sea. The other one brings us into the real Immemorial Star Sea.&rdquo;</span></p></div>
