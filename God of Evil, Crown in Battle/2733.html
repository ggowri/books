        <div> - Strongest Genius<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;It can only be used once within a certain period of time? In that case, roughly how long is the cooldown period?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The cooldown period is actually different per individual. It&rsquo;s determined according to one&rsquo;s cultivation. Currently in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the shortest cooldown period for Immortal Techniques would be an hour. There is currently only one person capable of this feat. That would be the strongest individual in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even for the longest cooldown period, it will only be a single day.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, this cooldown period is only for the same Immortal Technique. One can use different Immortal Techniques in succession.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Take Chu Xianshuo for example. After he unleashed the Immortal Technique Heavenly Lion Fist, he would likely have to wait another day should he want to unleash it again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if he knew another Immortal Technique, he would be able to immediately use that Immortal Technique against you after using the Immortal Technique Heavenly Lion Fist,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case. This junior understands now,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;In addition to all that, Immortal Techniques are the same as martial skills. They too are separated into ranks according to how strong they are.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Immortal Techniques are separated into nine ranks according to their power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For rank one Immortal Techniques, one must be at least a rank three True Immortal in order to learn them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, for ordinary people, they will need to be at least rank five True Immortal in order to learn a rank one Immortal Technique. That is the reason why the crowd was so astonished upon finding out that Chu Xianshuo had managed to learn an Immortal Technique at rank four True Immortal. After all, this proved that he was a martial cultivation genius.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for rank two Immortal Techniques, they would require at least a cultivation of rank six True Immortal to learn. For ordinary individuals, they would have to have a cultivation of rank eight True Immortal to learn. The other Immortal Techniques continue in a similar fashion.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In other words, rank one to rank three Immortal Techniques are capable of being learned at the True Immortal level.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for rank four to rank six Immortal Techniques, they would require a cultivation in the Heavenly Immortal realm to learn.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for rank seven to rank nine Immortal Techniques, only those with the cultivation of Martial Immortals can learn them,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master explained to Chu Feng in detail.<br>&ldquo;In that case, between Immortal Techniques and Immortal Taboo Martial Skills, which is stronger?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Actually, compared to Immortal Techniques, Immortal Taboo Martial Skills are rarer. As for which is stronger, Immortal Taboo Martial Skills themselves differ in power. Thus, it&rsquo;s very difficult to judge.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the way I see it, even the weakest Immortal Taboo Martial Skills would be stronger than rank three Immortal Techniques.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for stronger Immortal Taboo Martial Skills, it would be hard to determine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the history of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, there was someone who used an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill to fight off a rank nine Immortal Technique, and even obtained victory.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, this has only happened once before. Furthermore, it was that individual who did it. Thus, it is very possible that it was due to his own capability, and not that of the Immortal Taboo Martial Skill,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, may I know who that person was?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng was able to tell from the explanations provided by the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master that even though the weakest Immortal Taboo Martial Skills would be stronger than rank three Immortal Techniques, Immortal Taboo Martial Skills should, while capable of being stronger than rank three, four or even five Immortal Techniques, absolutely not be stronger than rank nine Immortal Techniques.<br>The reason for that was because the difference in ranks was simply too enormous. It was a gulf that would be very difficult to cross.<br>However, that person was able to rely on an Immortal Taboo Martial Skill to defeat the strongest Immortal Technique, a rank nine Immortal Technique. This was enough to prove how amazing that individual was.<br>Furthermore, that individual was the only person in the history of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm that had managed to accomplish that feat.<br>Chu Feng felt that that individual was most definitely a grand character. Even though Chu Feng did not know who that person was yet, Chu Feng was already feeling admiration for that individual.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master did not answer Chu Feng&rsquo;s question. Instead, he laughed profoundly.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that senior Villa Master possesses some sort of hidden trouble that is difficult to mention?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, are you unable to tell me who that person is?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He was able to tell that the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master did not wish to say the name of that individual.<br>&ldquo;That person&rsquo;s name is a taboo in the current Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. However, as there is no one else here, there is no harm in me telling you his name.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Speaking of it, you are quite fated with him. He possessed the same surname as you. He was also surnamed Chu. As for his name, it&rsquo;s Chu Xuanyuan,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him?!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was astonished. He was extremely excited and moved upon hearing that name.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Xuanyuan was none other than his father.<br>As his son, Chu Feng would naturally be feeling extremely proud to find out that his father had accomplished such a feat.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve heard of Chu Xuanyuan?&rdquo; At that moment, the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master was slightly surprised.<br>He felt that since Chu Feng was from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm and didn&rsquo;t even know what Immortal Techniques were, it would be surprising for him to know who Chu Xuanyuan was.<br>After all, Chu Xuanyuan was currently a taboo in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Very few people would mention him. Even when they did, they would only do so in private with their acquaintances.<br>With the situation being like that, it was generally very difficult for one to hear about Chu Xuanyuan in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>&ldquo;I have heard of his name being mentioned on the way here. However, I do not know much about him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Chu Xuanyuan should be someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan, right? Why was senior unwilling to bring up his name?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, when I heard of his name on the way here, the ones speaking of him were also very careful when doing so. It seemed as if they did not dare to have others hear their conversation.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had never heard Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s name being mentioned on his way here. The reason he knew about Chu Xuanyuan was because Chu Xuanyuan was his father.<br>However, Chu Feng was able to realize that something was amiss from the reaction of the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master. Thus, he wanted to know the reason as to why.<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanyuan is not only someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan, but he is also the most astonishing genius to have ever appeared in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There was only a single genius before him that could match up to him. As for that person, it was his father, Chu Hanxian.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, his father Chu Hanxian was only capable of being comparable to him. The way I see it, Chu Hanxian&rsquo;s talent for martial cultivation was inferior to Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s talent for martial cultivation was simply beyond comparison. He was most definitely an existence that surpassed all others in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To put it bluntly, little friend Chu Feng, while your martial cultivation talent can be rated to be demon-level, and is rarely seen in the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, this old man feels that there is still an enormous disparity should you be compared to the Chu Xuanyuan back then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At the very least, you are not the only demon-level genius in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm right now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, during Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s era, he was the only one capable of holding the title of genius.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is not that there were no geniuses in his era. Rather, his talent was simply so astonishingly powerful that he overshadowed all other geniuses.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If one&rsquo;s talent is to be described with light, then Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s talent would be akin to the sun and moon, whereas other geniuses&rsquo; talents would only be akin to that of a firefly&rsquo;s light.&rdquo;<br>When the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master brought up Chu Xuanyuan, even the tone that he spoke with became emotional.<br>In fact, even the expression in his eyes started to change. It was as if the image of Chu Xuanyuan had once again appeared in his eyes.<br>As for that image that he was seeing, it was the image of an existence that even he was subdued by.<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, Chu Xuanyuan made a mistake, and was expelled by the Chu Heavenly Clan because of that. Furthermore, after that happened, even his name became a taboo in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Chu Heavenly Clan did not allow his achievements to continue to circulate. The Chu Heavenly Clan personally buried the exceptional genius of Chu Xuanyuan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, Chu Feng, you must absolutely not speak of Chu Xuanyuan to anyone. This is even more so when you&rsquo;re in the presence of the Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, it is possible that you might court a disaster,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master warned Chu Feng in a very serious manner.<br>&ldquo;This junior understands,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That being said, little friend Chu Feng, you are also surnamed Chu, and possess a Heavenly Bloodline. Furthermore, you&rsquo;ve even trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am very curious. Which Heavenly Clan you are from? Could it be that there&rsquo;s a Chu Heavenly Clan in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm too?&rdquo; Suddenly, the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master shifted his eyes and began to look at Chu Feng with a profound expression.<br><br><br></p></div>
