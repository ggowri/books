        <h1>Chapter 4877</h1>
        <div>: Full Bloom<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The elder standing by the doorway of the room was over two meters tall, making him a towering presence over most people. However, he was also extremely thin as well. His height paired with his scrawny figure made him look like a bamboo pole.<br>One would imagine him to look sickly, but he seemed spirited and vigorous.<br>He had snowy-white hair and a long beard that extended beyond his knees. From the way he carried himself, it was apparent that he was someone who cared about his appearance.<br>He was also dressed in the clothes of the<br>Valley.<br>&ldquo;Paying respects to Lord Buyu.&rdquo;<br>The few elders standing with Lord Baimei quickly lowered their heads and greeted him. It would appear that Lord Buyu had an esteemed standing in the<br>Valley.<br>It was just that Lord Baimei didn&rsquo;t greet him. On the contrary, there was a displeased look on his face.<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Buyu, did Daoist Niantian tell you to come here? He really doesn&rsquo;t give up. Could it be that Chu Feng is his disciple?&rdquo;<br>Lord Baimei had made his attitude clear through his words.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, the reason why I&rsquo;m here has nothing to do with Brother Niantian. I also don&rsquo;t think that Brother Niantian has any relationship with Chu Feng,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu replied.<br>&ldquo;Oh? There&rsquo;s no one in the<br>Valley who doesn&rsquo;t know of your relationship with Daoist Niantian. You played a crucial role in him becoming an honorary elder of the<br>Valley. Shengguang Buyu, I can&rsquo;t dictate who you associate yourself with, but some words of advice: Remember your own surname and your identity!<br>&ldquo;Daoist Niantian is really getting out of hand. He even threatened me not to touch Chu Feng. His behavior isn&rsquo;t just a simple show of disrespect toward me. He doesn&rsquo;t respect the<br>Valley or Lord<br>at all!<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Buyu, you&rsquo;re a member of the<br>Valley. You should get your stance clear!&rdquo;<br>The mocking tone of Lord Baimei was clear for everyone to hear.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, I don&rsquo;t deny that I&rsquo;m on close terms with Brother Niantian, but he can take responsibility for his own actions. If he has truly offended Lord Baimei, I&rsquo;m certain that you won&rsquo;t let him off the hook easily given your personality.<br>&ldquo;Also, the reason why Brother Niantian was able to become an honorary elder was due to the contribution he has made to the<br>Valley. It has nothing to do with me, and I don&rsquo;t have the power to pull such strings,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu said.<br>&ldquo;What are you doing here then? If I haven&rsquo;t heard wrongly, you told me earlier not to kill this fellow? Could it be that you&rsquo;re related to him?&rdquo; Lord Baimei pointed to Chu Feng as he spoke.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, the<br>Lotus Tree has blossomed,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu said.<br>&ldquo;The<br>Lotus Tree has blossomed?&rdquo;<br>Delighted looks appeared on the faces of the elders present. Even Lord Baimei&rsquo; stern look mellowed down, and a hint of a smile could be seen at the corners of his eyes.<br>&ldquo;It has finally blossomed. Young miss Menglai, Xintian, and the others&rsquo; hard work have finally paid off.&rdquo;<br>Lord Baimei stroked his beard as the smile on his lips grew more and more apparent.<br>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t easy for the<br>Lotus Tree to blossom. We can&rsquo;t miss this opportunity. Since the<br>isn&rsquo;t here at the moment, I&rsquo;ll decide on his behalf here. Tell young miss Menglai, Xingtian, and the others to quickly enter the<br>Lotus Tree to cultivate,&rdquo; Lord Baimei ordered Shengguang Buyu.<br>Perhaps out of sheer joy, his attitude toward Shengguang Buyu became much more amicable than before.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, the<br>Lotus Tree blossomed only after Chu Feng was brought in here,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu pointed out.<br>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;<br>A slight frown appeared on Lord Baimei&rsquo;s forehead. The elders also exchanged glances with one another.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; Lord Baimei asked.<br>&ldquo;Lord Baimei, you should know that the<br>Lotus Tree possesses spirituality. It has always been said that only in the presence of an extremely talented individual will the<br>Lotus Tree blossom. The last time the<br>Lotus Tree blossomed was due to the closed-door disciple that the<br>brought in.<br>&ldquo;It should have been time for the<br>Lotus Tree to blossom once more, and young miss Menglai and the others have been cultivating with the tree&rsquo;s fruits in order to make it happen. However, despite their efforts, the tree still refused to blossom. It&rsquo;s only at Chu Feng&rsquo;s arrival that it finally blossomed. Don&rsquo;t you think that this is too much of a coincidence?&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu asked.<br>&ldquo;What a joke. Are you saying that the<br>Lotus Tree blossomed because it sensed Chu Feng&rsquo;s talents? Would our sacred tree blossom for an outsider?&rdquo; Lord Baimei sneered.<br>Shengguang Buyu seemed to have expected such a response, so he turned to the other elders and asked, &ldquo;Do you all think that it&rsquo;s a coincidence too?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah, this&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The elders stuttered with bitter smiles on their lips.<br>They were extremely familiar with the<br>Lotus Tree, and Shengguang Buyu&rsquo;s explanation sounded much more probable here. It was just that they dared not to offend Lord Baimei, so none of them dared to speak their thoughts.<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Buyu, you&rsquo;ve really worked hard to plead for Chu Feng&rsquo;s mercy. Regardless of whether it&rsquo;s a coincidence or not, what difference does it make? Am I not allowed to kill him just because the<br>Lotus Tree blossomed due to him?&rdquo; Lord Baimei asked.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have intervened if it was a normal blossoming, but the<br>Lotus Tree has fully bloomed,&rdquo; Shengguang Buyu replied.<br>&ldquo;What? Fully bloomed?&rdquo;<br>Those words astonished not just the elders but Lord Baimei too.<br>Shoosh!<br>There was a gust of wind, and Lord Baimei was no longer in the room anymore.<br>Seeing this, Shengguang Buyu chuckled softly before glancing at the other elders.<br>&ldquo;Take good care of Chu Feng. You&rsquo;ll suffer if anything were to happen to him.&rdquo;<br>Leaving those words behind, he quickly left the room too. He knew that Lord Baimei had gone to where the<br>Lotus Tree was to confirm his claim.<br>However, shortly after Shengguang Buyu left, the elders slowly started to grow excited. One of them even began trembling.<br>&ldquo;Could it really be true? Could this fellow be that formidable as to make the<br>Lotus Tree fully bloom?&rdquo; the trembling elder asked.<br>&ldquo;Lord Buyu wouldn&rsquo;t make such a blatant lie even if he wishes to save Chu Feng,&rdquo; another elder replied.<br>&ldquo;Sssss.&rdquo;<br>The elders gasped in astonishment as they turned their gaze toward Chu Feng.<br>They were determined to put Chu Feng to death previously, but now that they were looking at him once more, there was a hint of fear in their eyes.<br>The<br>Lotus Tree had existed since the Ancient Era, and it had been in the<br>Valley for over tens of thousands of years now. There was a saying in the valley that only the most talented cultivators could make the<br>Lotus Tree blossom up.<br>However, it was a completely different matter to make the<br>Lotus Tree fully bloom. Only someone who wielded the power to alter the power balance of the world of cultivation could make the tree fully bloom.<br>There were people in the<br>Valley who had made the<br>Lotus Tree blossom over the years, but not once had it enjoyed a full bloom before&hellip;<br></p></div>
