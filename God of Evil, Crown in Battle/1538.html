        <div> - True Purpose<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected that even the previous generation&rsquo;s Cursed Soil Seven are gathered here. This girl truly has some skills. To be able to gather them, she&rsquo;s quite remarkable,&rdquo; The World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master said.<br>&ldquo;Cursed Soil Seven? Those seven people beside the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s headmaster are the Cursed Soil Seven?&rdquo; Chu Feng discovered that there were eight other people in the cell in addition to Tantai Xue.<br>Among those eight, the person who was the most eye-catching would be the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s headmaster, Sang Kun. Other than Sang Kun, there were seven more people.<br>These seven people were all very powerful, they were actually all peak Half Martial Emperors. Furthermore, their clothing was different from that of the other elders of the Cursed Soil Sect. They were not wearing the outfit of the Cursed Soil Sect. Rather, they were wearing the outfit of the Cursed Soil Sacred Assembly.<br>This meant that these seven people should all be elders of the Cursed Soil Sacred Assembly. It was very likely that they were the previous generation&rsquo;s Cursed Soil Seven that the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master spoke of.<br>&ldquo;No, that one with the blonde hair is called Huang Dongsheng. While he is an elder of the Cursed Soil Sacred Assembly, he is not one of the Cursed Soil Seven.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The actual Cursed Soil Seven are Sang Kun and the other six,&rdquo; The World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master explained.<br>&ldquo;So the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s headmaster Sang Kun is actually one of the Cursed Soil Seven,&rdquo; Chu Feng finally came to realize that the Cursed Soil Seven was actually a status passed from generation to generation. Although Sang Kun was now the headmaster of the Cursed Soil Sect and had personally chosen the current Cursed Soil Seven to nurture, he had actually been a member of the Cursed Soil Seven himself during his youth.<br>It would appear that the Cursed Soil Seven was a special sort of continued tradition of the Cursed Soil Sect.<br>&ldquo;This rescue is of the utmost importance. Brother Hong, join us,&rdquo; The World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master said.<br>&ldquo;Mn, let&rsquo;s start,&rdquo; Hong Qiang and Miao Renlong both nodded their heads. Afterwards, the three of them began to act.<br>They had already planned beforehand that, for the sake of not causing unnecessary troubles, they were going to completely seal off this place by setting up a very powerful concealing formation before they acted.<br>To the outside world, they would not see any change to this region, as the spirit formation that they were setting up was not only capable of preventing others from escaping, it would also isolate sound and even the movements of the air.<br>As long as the spirit formation was successfully set up, Chu Feng and the others would be able to charge into the cell to save Tantai Xue and kill the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s headmaster and the others without any concern.<br>However, a spirit formation of this level was naturally very difficult to set up. After all, what the spirit formation would be used against would not be ordinary people. Rather, it would be eight peak Half Martial Emperors. Furthermore, they had to be extremely careful when setting up this spirit formation. They could not make any noise or attract any attention. Thus, it became extremely difficult to set up the spirit formation.<br>Even though it was Hong Qiang, the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong, three expert world spiritists who were joining hands to set up this spirit formation, they still required a certain amount of time.<br>Dugu Xingfeng was unable to help. Thus, he, the grand headmaster of the Cyanwood Mountain, became a temporary guard and began to pay close attention to their surroundings. Dugu Xingfeng was ready to kill anyone that might approach them.<br>With these four experts present, Chu Feng became an idle person. Thus, he decided to use his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to continue to monitor the situation inside the cell.<br>Although he was unable to hear what the people inside the cell were talking about, Chu Feng was able to see the movements of their mouths with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes. Through the change in their mouths, Chu Feng was able to decipher what they were saying. Even though he could not hear the conversation, he was able to see it.<br>Thus, at this moment, Chu Feng knew exactly what the people in the cell were talking about.<br>&ldquo;Miss Tantai, I have gathered all of the people that you wanted me to gather. This is quite a large effort for me. After all, it&rsquo;s not easy to gather all of us fellow martial brothers together.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now, you can tell me where you have hidden the Talismanic Soul Absorbing Flute, right?&rdquo; the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s headmaster asked.<br>It was very strange. Tantai Xue had not only stolen his item, she was also deemed to be the person who had killed his proud disciples. Yet, the attitude that he had toward Tantai Xue was not vile at all. On the contrary, it was very amiable. Most importantly, that amiable attitude of his did not appear to be fake.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve killed a couple of your proudest disciples, are you really planning to let me go?&rdquo; Tantai Xue asked.<br>&ldquo;I admit, you did kill Qisha and the others. That made me feel a great amount of heartache. However, I am a person who can see far and beyond. While it is true that Qisha and the others possessed exceptional talent, they are greatly inferior when compared to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If their deaths can be exchanged for you joining us, I believe that will be our fortune instead of misfortune. Qisha and the others&rsquo; deaths will also have served their purpose.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, girl, you can rest assured. As long as you hand over the Talismanic Soul Absorbing Flute, not only will I not kill you, I will also guarantee you a high position and great wealth. I will take you as my personal disciple. In the future, the position of the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s headmaster will also be passed on to you. You will become our Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s first female headmaster,&rdquo; The Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s headmaster vowed.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng finally realized why Tantai Xue was unharmed even after being caught for so long.<br>It turned out that the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s headmaster had grown fond of Tantai Xue&rsquo;s potential and was planning to disregard his former hatred in order to have Tantai Xue join them.<br>Sure enough, to people like the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s headmaster, feelings and emotions were not worth anything before self-interest and benefits. Furthermore, Chu Feng felt that the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s headmaster might never have considered Jiang Qisha and the others to be his disciples. Jiang Qisha and the other Cursed Soil Seven of this generation were merely seven chess pieces to the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>And now, a chess piece that was so amazing had appeared before him. Not to mention throwing away a couple chess pieces, even if he were to abandon all of the chess pieces that he had spent many years nurturing, it was likely that the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s headmaster would not hesitate in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;Miss, senior brother Sang has always been someone who keeps his promises. He will definitely not lie to you,&rdquo; An old man who appeared to be the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s headmaster&rsquo;s junior brother urged.<br>&ldquo;Miss Tantai, our Cursed Soil Sect is a sensible sect. As long as you&rsquo;re willing to hand over the Talismanic Soul Absorbing Flute, everything else can be discussed,&rdquo; The other old men also started to advise Tantai Xue.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Right at this moment, Taitai Xue started to laugh. Her laughter was very beautiful and very enchanting. Her beauty was not the kind of graceful and amorous beauty. Rather, it was a beauty that seemed to be outside of the mortal world, an extremely ice-cold beauty.<br>After Tantai Xue laughed coldly, she said, &ldquo;I have not called you all here for the sake of having you all urge my surrender and vowing allegiance to you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, why have you called us all here?&rdquo; One of the old men asked.<br>&ldquo;I want your lives,&rdquo; A flash of ice-cold chilliness shone through Tantai Xue&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>That Cursed Soil Sacred Assembly&rsquo;s elder by the name of Huang Dongsheng suddenly waved his sleeve, and a Royal Armament dagger appeared in his hand. After a flash of light, he pierced that Royal Armament dagger into the dantian of the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s headmaster&rsquo;s junior brother.<br>After that, the dagger in his hand started to tremble. &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; That old man&rsquo;s dantian shattered. Like a corpse, he fell to the ground.<br>&ldquo;Elder Huang, have you gone mad?&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, the Cursed Soil Sect&rsquo;s headmaster and the others were all shocked. They had expressions of confusion all over their faces. Everything had happened so quickly that they were simply unable to accept the situation.<br>&ldquo;Elder Huang? You old animals should take a careful look at who I am.&rdquo;<br>That Elder Huang coldly laughed. Then, his appearance began to change. After the transformation ended, that Huang Dongsheng became a completely different person.<br>It was a white-haired old man. His hair was whiter than snow, but he had the face of a middle-aged man. His expression was extremely grave and stern, like a sharp knife. In his eyes was strong hatred.<br>[1. Yeah, it was strange for me too. White haired old man with middle aged appearance. Shouldn&rsquo;t it be white haired middle aged man?]<br></p></div>
