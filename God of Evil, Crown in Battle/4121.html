        <h1>Chapter 4120</h1>
        <div> - Who Did This?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they were waiting, Fumo Shaoyu said to his sister, &ldquo;Lil' Sis, how about you go out first? Brother Chu Feng and I can keep watch here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Once we get the scale, we&rsquo;ll go and meet up with you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, if we&rsquo;re going to die, we&rsquo;ll die together. I&rsquo;m staying with you guys.&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was extremely stubborn. She insisted on staying.<br>&ldquo;Foolish girl, why do you insist on not listening?&rdquo; Fumo Shaoyu was slightly angered.<br>It could be seen that even though he would mess around with his younger sister, he was actually very concerned for her well-being.<br>He did not wish for her to take such a risk with him.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to fear? Didn&rsquo;t Chu Feng already set up the teleportation formation? Once we get the scale, we&rsquo;ll leave right away,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was still unwilling to leave.<br>&ldquo;Shh, quiet down,&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly said to the siblings in a nervous manner.<br>The siblings were initially confused by Chu Feng&rsquo;s nervous reaction.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>But, all of a sudden, a roar sounded from outside.<br>Following that, a violent wind swept forth. The wind was so strong that the flames in the blazing cliff were scattered in all directions, seemingly wanting to escape.<br>The violent wind grew stronger and stronger. The roar also grew more and more ear-piercing.<br>Under the wind and the roar, Chu Feng and the siblings felt that their bodies were about to be torn apart, and their souls were about to be shattered to pieces.<br>Because of that, Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er finally reacted to Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>They knew that an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast had returned.<br>Chu Feng had anticipated that such a thing would happen.<br>After all, he had experienced the might of an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast.<br>That said, he was still surprised to see shock and fear on the faces of the Fumo siblings.<br>Especially Fumo Xin&rsquo;er. She was so scared that her face had turned deathly pale.<br>&ldquo;The full power of an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast is actually this terrifying?&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er said using voice transmission.<br>Her voice was actually trembling.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng realized one thing.<br>Evidently, neither Fumo Xin&rsquo;er nor Fumo Shaoyu had experienced the true power of an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast before.<br>Could it be that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts were unable to reveal their true power unless they left the Heaven-devouring Realm or entered the blazing cliff?<br>That should be the case.<br>Else, facing such a powerful Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er would likely not even have the opportunity to use her Demon Vanquishing Talisman, much less rescue Chu Feng from its stomach.<br>&ldquo;Lil sis, it is not too late for you to leave now,&rdquo; Fumo Shaoyu said to Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was hesitating. She was no longer as stubborn as before.<br>It could be seen that she was really scared.<br>The might of that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast had terrified her.<br>As the violent wind continued to blow, a colossus finally appeared from above and landed inside the blazing cliff.<br>It was none other than an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast that had just returned.<br>That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast was as impressive and imposing as Chu Feng remembered.<br>Even though he and the siblings were hidden, they were still unable to keep their heartbeats from accelerating upon seeing that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast.<br>Nervousness, unease, fear and all sorts of other emotions filled every inch of their souls.<br>Facing an existence that could easily obliterate them, it would be a lie to say that they were not afraid.<br>Their fear was even more intense as they planned to remove three scales from that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast.<br>Removing three scales from such a powerful existence...<br>It was no different from ordinary people trying to remove three whiskers from a tiger&rsquo;s mouth. In fact, it would be even more dangerous than that.<br>It would be one thing if they could quickly escape. However, if they failed to escape, they would undoubtedly be killed.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast&hellip; how could it be so seriously injured?&rdquo;<br>Soon, the expressions of Chu Feng and the siblings changed.<br>They were surprised to discover that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast had actually been wounded.<br>A vast amount of blood was flowing from that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast&rsquo;s massive body nonstop.<br>The blood formed a river at the bottom of the blazing cliff.<br>In fact, it was not only blood. Even the scales on the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast had grown loose.<br>Perhaps because it was in too much pain, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast actually began to roll around nonstop the moment it landed on the ground.<br>It was rolling around like a human would when they were in enormous pain.<br>As the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast rolled around, several scales fell off of its body.<br>&ldquo;This Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast, how could it be so injured?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that your grandma injured it?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked to the Fumo siblings.<br>After all, in the entire Heaven-devouring Realm, only Fumo Shaoyu, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er and their grandma were able to curb the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts.<br>As both Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er were inside the blazing cliff, it would mean that their grandma would be the only person capable of seriously injuring the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts.<br>&ldquo;Absolutely not.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While our clan&rsquo;s Demon Vanquishing Talismans are capable of curbing the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts, we are unable to seriously injure them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, my grandma has always said that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts cannot be defeated.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As such, seriously injuring an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast to such a degree would be impossible.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast exited the Heaven-devouring Realm and encountered an expert cultivator that ended up seriously injuring it?&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;An expert cultivator?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could there really be such an expert in the Holy Light Galaxy? Could there really be an expert whom even an Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast would not be a match for?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had a pensive look. Shock filled his heart.<br>He had no idea exactly how powerful the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beasts were.<br>However, the feeling the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast gave Chu Feng was, as that old granny had said, that of an undefeatable existence.<br>If there really was someone in the Holy Light Galaxy capable of seriously injuring that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast, exactly how powerful must they be?<br>Even though Chu Feng already knew that he was very small and weak when placed within the entire Holy Light Galaxy, he realized that he had still underestimated the strength of the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>Perhaps he was actually much smaller and weaker than he had imagined himself to be.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think too much. These scales were all shed by that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast after it returned to the blazing cliff. This is perfect for us; we can use them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The heavens are helping me. Truly the heavens are helping me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even the heavens want me to leave this place smoothly.&rdquo;<br>Compared to Chu Feng and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er, who were curious as to how that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast ended up so seriously injured, Fumo Shaoyu was extremely excited.<br>After all, the only thing in his mind was leaving this place, and checking out the outside.<br>And now, the opportunity to do so was right before his eyes. It was only natural that he would be excited.<br>Everything was as he had said.<br>It seems like even the heavens wanted them to leave this place unhindered.<br>Perhaps because that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast was too injured, it soon fell asleep.<br>Seizing their opportunity, Chu Feng and the siblings picked up four scales from the ground. Then, they escaped from the blazing cliff through the teleportation formation...<br>Before leaving, Chu Feng turned around and glanced back at the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Heaven-devouring Beast covered in wounds.<br>He was still wondering exactly who it was that had injured such a terrifying colossal monster.<br></p></div>
