        <h1>Chapter 5294</h1>
        <div>: Arrogant, Aren&rsquo;t You? I&rsquo;ll Dig Your Ancestral Grave!<br>&ldquo;How can you be this strong?&rdquo; Yue Lian was appalled.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Situ Kunye sneered. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not bother wasting time. You aren&rsquo;t a match for me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a match for you? You must be joking!&rdquo; Refusing to admit defeat, Yue Lian exerted his spirit power with even greater intensity once more.<br>&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo;<br>Situ Kunye constructed a barrier around him and Yue Lian to prevent any destruction to the main hall. From the barrier itself, it was apparent to Chu Feng that Situ Kunye was stronger than Yue Lian.<br>And the outcome reflected exactly that. From the start to the end, Situ Kunye thoroughly suppressed Yue Lian even though they were both Royal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists.<br>&ldquo;Is Yue Lian that weak?&rdquo; Eggy was surprised.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that Yue Lian is weak. Situ Kunye is simply too strong,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Is Situ Kunye that formidable? It looks like he has been concealing his true strength all along,&rdquo; Eggy remarked.<br>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not his own strength. He&rsquo;s a Royal Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, but his spirit power has been further enhanced by an extremely powerful formation. That&rsquo;s why he is able to defeat Yue Lian with ease,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Eggy was surprised. She hadn&rsquo;t noticed any formations at all.<br>&ldquo;The formation energy seems to be coming from the ground. It could be their clan protection formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he carefully examined his surroundings with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>The fight between Situ Kunye and Yue Lian soon concluded, with the victor being Situ Kunye. Yue Lian collapsed onto the floor, and Situ Kunye triumphantly stepped on his body.<br>&ldquo;Do you concede defeat?&rdquo; Situ Kunye asked.<br>&ldquo;Concede defeat? Why should I concede defeat to you? Who do you think you are?&rdquo; Yue Lian bellowed. His defeat hadn&rsquo;t changed his derisory attitude toward Situ Kunye and the entire Situ World Spiritist Clan in the least.<br>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Situ Kunye sneered.<br>Situ Kunye retracted his leg, and Yue Lian hurriedly got back onto his feet in hopes of making a counterattack.<br>Uwa!<br>Barely as Yue Lian returned to his feet, he suddenly crumbled to the ground once more. Much to his horror, his spirit power had dissipated, and a sharp pain was surging through his body. He struggled to raise his head to look at Situ Kunye, only to see that the latter wasn&rsquo;t using his spirit power at all.<br>Instead, Situ Kunye had formed a hand seal and was emanating a peculiar aura.<br>&ldquo;Y-you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s doing this?&rdquo;<br>Yue Lian noticed that the aura emanated by Situ Kunye was similar to the energy wrecking his body. Without a doubt, Situ Kunye was the one behind his condition.<br>&ldquo;Fool. You didn&rsquo;t notice the poisonous gu despite having checked the Pulse Soothing Lotus Cream with your spirit power,&rdquo; Situ Kunye sneered. &ldquo;Make no mistake though. I defeated you earlier with my own strength. I only fed you the poisonous gu as a safety precaution. Who could have thought that you&rsquo;d be so weak?&rdquo;<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clansmen also burst into laughter. They had been wanting to get back at Yue Lian for the humiliation he had dished out on them, and their wishes had finally come true.<br>&ldquo;You bastard! Do you know who I am? I am an honorary elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect! Do you think that the Pill Dao Immortal Sect will forgive your transgression?&rdquo; Yue Lian roared.<br>&ldquo;Are you trying to intimidate me with the Pill Dao Immortal Sect?&rdquo; Situ Kunye scoffed. He took out a token and showed it to Yue Lian. &ldquo;Have a look at this!&rdquo;<br>Yue Lian was stunned to see the token. From his years of association with the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, he could tell that the token was real, and he understood its significance too.<br>&ldquo;H-how did you obtain that token?&rdquo; Yue Lian couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes.<br>&ldquo;You have two options&mdash;submit to me or die an excruciating death. You should know what this token represents. I can kill you right now, and all I&rsquo;ll face is minor punishment from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect, and that&rsquo;s assuming that the Pill Dao Immortal Sect learns about it in the first place. Do you understand what I&rsquo;m saying?&rdquo; Situ Kunye said with a threatening glint in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; As infuriated as Yue Lian was, he had no choice but to drop his arrogant attitude.<br>Situ Kunye formed another series of hand seals, which manifested a submission contract within Yue Lian&rsquo;s body. Should Yue Lian sign this contract, his life would belong to Situ Kunye from this day onward.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo; Yue Lian roared in indignance.<br>&ldquo;My patience is running thin. Sign it, or die,&rdquo; Situ Kunye said.<br>He shifted his hand seal, causing the energy inside Yue Lian&rsquo;s body to approach his vitals.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sign it!&rdquo; Yue Lian finally relented and signed the contract.<br>The prowess of the poisonous gu immediately grew even more potent. Until the poisonous gu was lifted, Yue Lian had no choice but to do Situ Kunye&rsquo;s bidding.<br>&ldquo;Kowtow to my clan elders and apologize for your previous insolence,&rdquo; Situ Kunye ordered.<br>&ldquo;Elders, I was wrong. I apologize for my previous insolence.&rdquo; As reluctant as Yue Lian was, he still did as he was told.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo; Situ Kunye burst into laughter.<br>Situ Tingye and the other elders also smiled in glee. They were amazed by the formidable means of their clan chief despite his young age, and it soothed their rattled nerves. Even with the recent deaths of their junior prodigies, their Situ World Spiritist Clan would be able to make a comeback as long as Situ Kunye was around.<br>&ldquo;Stand up. Soon enough, everyone will know that Chu Feng is nothing but a paper tiger. He wants to exact vengeance for the Golden Dragon Flame Sect? Hah! He&rsquo;ll suffer a fate ten times worse than what his grandmother went through!&rdquo; Situ Kunye sneered.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he acting so smug about? Does he think that he rules the world just because he has the Pill Dao Immortal Sect&rsquo;s backing? Screw it, Chu Feng. Show yourself. Use your strongest token and show them who&rsquo;s boss!&rdquo; Eggy couldn&rsquo;t stand it anymore and urged Chu Feng to make a move.<br>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t worthy of me using my strongest token on. Calm down, Eggy. I have something better in mind,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Something better in mind?&rdquo; Eggy was perplexed.<br>Chu Feng turned around and left the main hall. With his concealment means and unique formation deciphering method, he ventured into the depths of the Situ World Spiritist Clan with hardly any impediments at all.<br>He already had a destination in mind.<br>Finally, he arrived at a graveyard. While the exterior of the graveyard was tightly guarded, there was no one in the graveyard itself. Not even the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen were allowed to freely enter this place. It was their forbidden land.<br>This was where the ancestors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan were buried. Every single tomb in the graveyard was a show of extravagance in itself.<br>&ldquo;Is this the graveyard of the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s ancestors?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Great! How dare they act so arrogant? Let&rsquo;s see if they can maintain that attitude after we dig up their ancestral graves!&rdquo; Eggy excitedly exclaimed.<br></div>
