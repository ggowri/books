        <div> - Training Martial Skill<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Girl, it&rsquo;s enough. We&rsquo;re all on the same side, there&rsquo;s no need to become this angry,&rdquo; Long Shengbu smiled and spoke to diffuse Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Girl, that&rsquo;s enough. We&rsquo;re all on the same side, there&rsquo;s no need to be this angry,&rdquo; Long Shengbu smiled and spoke to diffuse Long Xiaoxiao's anger.<br>He did not wish for things to become too tense.<br>&ldquo;I, Long Xiaoxiao, will not bicker with them today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, they cannot forget their status. They cannot forget what a superior and subordinate relationship is,&rdquo; said Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;This subordinate is guilty,&rdquo; Elder Ruiyun and Long Nanxun spoke at the same time.<br>However, Long Xiaoxiao completely ignored them. She turned around and looked at Chu Feng.<br>When she looked to Chu Feng, the look of anger and her aggressive gaze disappeared, and were replaced with a mischievous adorableness.<br>Especially her eyes which had narrowed into two crescents. She looked truly charming.<br>&ldquo;Little benefactor, my apologies. I&rsquo;ve failed to discipline them properly and have incurred ridicule through my poor performance,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;What happened today cannot be blamed on you, princess. It is I who let down princess&rsquo;s expectations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If the opportunity presents itself again, I will definitely make up for today,&rdquo; Chu Feng said very apologetically.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a deal. You better keep it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be waiting for you to make up for this.&rdquo;<br>As Long Xiaoxiao spoke, she deliberately took a step forward. The distance between her and Chu Feng was very close.<br>This scene caused Long Nanxun&rsquo;s eyes to turn red. Even the others were surprised by her behavior.<br>However, Long Xiaoxiao did not make any intimate actions. Instead, she merely continued chatting with Chu Feng.<br>Although Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s attitude towards him was very good, Chu Feng found it unsuitable for him to linger.<br>Thus, after bidding a simple farewell, he left with Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>As for Long Xiaoxiao, she was very kind. Together with Long Shengbu, she saw Chu Feng and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er out of the palaces before turning around..<br>She also had Long Nanxun and Elder Ruiyun accompany them.<br>Likely, she was afraid that they might attempt to harm Chu Feng and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>En route, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er looked to Chu Feng and asked, &ldquo;How come you&rsquo;re not feeling disappointed?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had been very sullen earlier.<br>It was one thing if he was really unable to defeat those two world spiritists.<br>But, he was unable to compete with them due to various reasons. Because of that, he had ended up being ridiculed. It was only normal for him to feel down.<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er had thought that Chu Feng&rsquo;s mood would be greatly affected.<br>She didn&rsquo;t expect him to react like he was completely fine.<br>&ldquo;What has happened has already happened. Even if I am to feel unwell, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to change anything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I believe that Senior Long would be able to understand, and wouldn&rsquo;t blame me,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You truly have a decent attitude towards life.&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er smiled. However, as she spoke, she turned around and took a glance at the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s camp, which was growing further and further away.<br>Chu Feng naturally noticed her action of looking back.<br>However, he did not notice a trace of coldness flash through Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s eyes as she looked back.<br>Then, Chu Feng and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er met up with Long Daozhi.<br>Chu Feng informed Long Daozhi of what had happened. Long Daozhi would naturally not blame Chu Feng. After all, he felt like he owed Chu Feng enormously already.<br>That said, Chu Feng and the others did not leave at once.<br>The reason for that was because he had made arrangements with Fumo Shaoyu to find them there.<br>Judging from the time that had passed, he should be arriving soon.<br>Chu Feng had wanted to return to the Ancestral Martial Starfield after meeting up with Fumo Shaoyu.<br>That said, the location where Chu Feng was going was not the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Instead, it was the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.<br>Back then, when Chu Feng had competed for the Ancestral Martial Decastars rankings in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm&rsquo;s Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound, he and Wuma Shengjie had encountered a mysterious existence in the depths of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.<br>That mysterious existence had not only snatched Chu Feng&rsquo;s Qilin Egg, it had also left a poison in Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>Furthermore, it had told Chu Feng to find it once he became an Utmost Exalted.<br>Although the mysterious existence had given Chu Feng ten years to reach the Utmost Exalted realm, he had experienced the power of the poison.<br>As such, since he had already become an Utmost Exalted, he would have to seek out that mysterious existence.<br>Although he had no idea what the goal of that mysterious existence was, he needed to remove the poison in his body. Otherwise, if the poison flared up again it would be truly dangerous.<br>During the day, everyone gathered together. When night arrived, they all split off to rest in their respective locations.<br>Chu Feng was unable to contain himself, and entered his world spirit space.<br>Both Her Lady Queen and Yu Sha were training with their eyes closed.<br>&ldquo;Say, two little ancestors, aren&rsquo;t you spending too much time training?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If one of you were awake today, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been humiliated like that,&rdquo; Chu Feng sighed helplessly.<br>Of course, his words were him lamenting what had happened.<br>When Yu Sha had entered closed-door training, her cultivation had only been that of an early Exalted.<br>As for Her Lady Queen, her cultivation was even weaker when she had entered closed-door training.<br>Even though the two of them had been in closed-door training for a very long time, Chu Feng could not be completely certain that their cultivations would reach the Utmost Exalted realm the moment they came out.<br>It would be too outrageous if that was the case.<br>Thus, even if the two of them weren&rsquo;t in closed-door training, Chu Feng would still not have been a match for Yue Yang should they compete with world spirits. Whilst that dark-skinned fatty was ugly, his skills were real.<br>After all, Asura World Spirits were renowned for their proud personalities. To be able to have a rank one Utmost Exalted-level Asura World Spirit serve him was very remarkable.<br>Chu Feng merely took a single glance at Her Lady Queen and Yu Sha. He didn&rsquo;t disturb them.<br>Being in closed-door training was very dangerous.<br>Chu Feng could not bother them just because he felt like it.<br>The main reason that Chu Feng had entered his world spirit space was the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one that made me lose face today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t disappoint me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he looked at the horsetail whisk.<br>After saying that, Chu Feng examined the horsetail whisk. After being unable to find any clues, he exited his world spirit space.<br>After exiting, Chu Feng did not rest. Instead, he took out some scrolls and began to study them meticulously.<br>Chu Feng had become an Utmost Exalted now.<br>But, he had never learned any new martial skills at all.<br>His strongest martial skill was still the rank one Exalted Taboo: Heavenly Fate Seal given to him by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>Previously, Chu Feng had obtained the Purple Star Hall&rsquo;s Hall Protection Martial Skill, the rank three Exalted Taboo: Purple Meteor Shower. Not long ago, he had also gained quite a harvest in the Endless Abyss.<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted and those four world spiritists had not only possessed spirit formation treasures and materials, there were also Exalted Taboo Martial Skills.<br>Chu Feng wanted to quickly grasp all those abilities.<br>After all, the Holy Light Galaxy was enormous.<br>He felt that he would inevitably encounter someone evenly matched against him.<br>If Chu Feng did not possess even stronger martial skills than his opponent, he would be at a disadvantage.<br>Whilst all this was happening, Chu Feng had no idea that Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was not resting in her room...<br></p></div>
