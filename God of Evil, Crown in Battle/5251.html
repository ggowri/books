        <h1>Chapter 5252</h1>
        <div>: A Fake Chu Feng<br>A few days later, Yue Lian and the experts of the Situ World Spiritist Clan arrived at the Purpleflame Upper Realm.<br>In contrast to the confident Yue Lian, the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen appeared fretful.<br>&ldquo;Lord Tingye, do you think we&rsquo;ll be able to capture Chu Feng this time around?&rdquo; Situ Hongbo asked worriedly.<br>&ldquo;That brat is a devious one, but our formation over the Purpleflame Mountain Range is also not to be made light of either. If the news we have received is true, it&rsquo;ll be hard for Chu Feng to escape.&rdquo;<br>Despite being confident about the formation enveloping the Purpleflame Mountain Range, Situ Tingye still harbored reservations as to whether they would be able to capture Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Do you not trust me?&rdquo; Yue Lian asked authoritatively.<br>&ldquo;Lord Yue, we have confidence in you, but the ones who have captured Chu Feng aren&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; Situ Tingye said.<br>&ldquo;Those people know my personality, They wouldn&rsquo;t dare to call me over unless they are absolutely certain of the matter. Trust me, Chu Feng is nothing but a cornered rat now. You can sit back and watch the show,&rdquo; Yue Lian said.<br>With a wave of his hand, he infused his spirit power into the flying warship&rsquo;s formation core, causing it to speed up considerably. It didn&rsquo;t take long for them to arrive at Purpleflame Mountain Range.<br>It was just that the sight before them left them dumbfounded.<br>The Purpleflame Mountain Range before their eyes was different from what they remembered. All of the Purpleflame Flowers had withered, and corpses were littered all around. Yue Lian&rsquo;s two subordinates were amongst the casualties too.<br>All of them had died tragic deaths, but what was worse was that their corpses were lined up to form a sentence:<br>Situ World Spiritist Clan colluding with Yue Lian; trash working with trash.<br>The crowd panicked upon seeing those words.<br>They realized that Chu Feng might have been stronger than they had expected. After all, Yue Lian&rsquo;s subordinates were at Half-God level!<br>On the other hand, Yue Lian trembled in rage. He felt that someone had challenged his dignity and humiliated him.<br>&ldquo;Lord Yue Lian, is this the show you speak of?&rdquo; Situ Tingye stepped forward and asked.<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clan had suffered heavy losses here, not just in terms of the casualties but also the Purpleflame Flowers. These flowers were one of their most cherished resources. It was unknown why the Purpleflame Flowers would suddenly wither, but without a doubt, this was a heavy blow to the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re blaming me? It&rsquo;s your formation that has failed. You are the one who has a grudge against Chu Feng. There&rsquo;s no way you could have avoided this massacre. My subordinates died trying to save your Situ World Spiritist Clansmen, but you&rsquo;re blaming me for it?&rdquo;<br>Yue Lian glared at Situ Tingye with vicious eyes.<br>As displeased as Situ Tingye was, he dared not to argue with Yue Lian. He put on a fawning smile and replied, &ldquo;Lord Yue, that&rsquo;s not what I mean.&rdquo;<br>It couldn&rsquo;t be helped since he was the weaker one here.<br>In any case, this incident greatly reduced the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s faith in Yue Lian. They even wondered if they could really take down Chu Feng by working together with him.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before Chu Feng falls into my grasp. He&rsquo;ll beg me to kill him,&rdquo; Yue Lian spat through gritted teeth.<br>His confident declaration was met with silence from the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>What they didn&rsquo;t know was that two other people were watching their movements from the sky. These two people weren&rsquo;t too far away from them, but for some reason, Yue Lian and the others didn&rsquo;t notice their presence at all.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that little trash acting all smug for? I really want to smack the living daylights out of him!&rdquo;<br>One of them expressed his dissatisfaction with Yue Lian. He wasn&rsquo;t just talking big here. If he showed himself right now, Yue Lian would probably piss his pants, for he was a member of the famous Totem Nine Daoists, Daoist Ninth Dragon.<br>The person beside him was even more incredible&mdash;Daoist Eighth Dragon.<br>After discussion with Daoist Sixth Dragon and Daoist Seventh Dragon, they had come to the decision to split up to search for Chu Feng&rsquo;s whereabouts and protect him from the shadows. When they learned about Chu Feng&rsquo;s grudge against the Situ World Spiritist Clan, Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Ninth Dragon headed to their headquarters together in hopes of finding him.<br>Yet, after days of waiting, the person who came was Yue Lian instead. The middle-aged man declared with conviction that he would take Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.<br>Later on, Yue Lian received news that Chu Feng was trapped here and hurriedly made his way over, so the two brothers tagged along as well.<br>Their initial intention was to swoop in when Chu Feng was in critical danger and make him owe them a huge favor, but who could have thought that Yue Lian was more useless than they had thought?<br>That was also why Daoist Ninth Dragon was annoyed to hear Yue Lian talking big after his failure.<br>&ldquo;Ninth Brother, I doubt that Yue Lian has the capability to capture Chu Feng. I don&rsquo;t think that we should waste our time here. I&rsquo;ll take my leave first,&rdquo; Daoist Eighth Dragon said.<br>&ldquo;Eighth Brother, I think that he&rsquo;s inept too. I&rsquo;ll search with Chu Feng together with you,&rdquo; Daoist Ninth Dragon said.<br>&ldquo;Ninth Brother, he might be inept, but he has a lot of subordinates. There&rsquo;s no saying that his subordinates might just be able to get a handle on Chu Feng. It&rsquo;ll be best if you could continue following him since he&rsquo;s the one who poses the biggest threat to Chu Feng at the moment,&rdquo; Daoist Eighth Dragon said.<br>&ldquo;What you said makes sense.<br>Haa<br>, I&rsquo;ll stay here then,&rdquo; Daoist Ninth Dragon replied with a reluctant look on his face.<br>&hellip;<br>After leaving the Purpleflame Upper Realm, Chu Feng continued his massacre of the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>With his breakthrough to White Dragon God-cloak, his highest fighting prowess was superior to Gray Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist, evident from how he was able to defeat even a rank two Half-God level cultivator in battle.<br>And in terms of formation breaching, his skills were comparable to Blue Dragon God-cloak World Spiritists.<br>With his overwhelming strength and meticulousness, he was able to lay waste wherever he went without much trouble. Not even Yue Lian&rsquo;s subordinates were able to stand in his way. Those whom he had encountered ended up dead.<br>As a result, it didn&rsquo;t take long for Chu Feng to eradicate more of the Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s branches.<br>News spread like wildfire.<br>This time around, it wasn&rsquo;t just the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen who deserted their posts. Yue Lian&rsquo;s subordinates were doing the same too. This caused Chu Feng&rsquo;s reputation to soar in the True Dragon Starfield.<br>Everyone thought that the Situ World Spiritist Clan was done for.<br>&hellip;<br>Chu Feng had just massacred yet another Situ World Spiritist Clan&rsquo;s base, but he didn&rsquo;t leave the realm right away because Milady Queen was craving meat buns.<br>Beings of their cultivation level no longer had to consume sustenance to survive, but cultivators were still fond of delicacies.<br>Needless to say, Chu Feng would do his best to fulfill Eggy&rsquo;s demands. If she wanted to have meat buns, he would bring her to the best. It was possible that he might get recognized along the way, but he wasn&rsquo;t bothered by it. No one in this realm was a match for him anyway.<br>Besides, Chu Feng realized that despite his resounding reputation in the True Dragon Starfield, there weren&rsquo;t many people who knew his appearance.<br>It might have been because the Situ World Spiritist Clan had been humiliated, but they didn&rsquo;t widely distribute wanted portraits of him. On the contrary, as Chu Feng became more famous, fake portraits of him grew rampant. Some cultivators even impersonated him based on those fake portraits to deceive others.<br>This made it harder to determine who was the real Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng made his way to Immortal Bun Pavilion, the most famous meat bun restaurant in this realm. The restaurant was massive, boasting thirteen palaces with nineteen levels each. Customers who dined at a higher level would enjoy a higher level of service and a more peaceful atmosphere, but the prices charged would be higher too.<br>Uwa!<br>Just as Chu Feng arrived at the entrance, he saw a three-meters tall man with a vicious face thrown out of the meat bun restaurant.<br>&ldquo;Screw you! Do you know who I am? I am Chu Feng! How dare you treat me like that? I&rsquo;ll massacre your whole clan!&rdquo; the man hollered at the restaurant while spurting blood.<br>&ldquo;Get lost! You can&rsquo;t afford our buns but still want to impersonate Chu Feng? Whack him!&rdquo;<br>The three-meters tall man suddenly floated into the sky. Alarmed, he tried to struggle free but to no avail. Several wooden sticks flew out from one of the palaces and began striking him.<br>Someone was teaching the man a lesson.<br>Chu Feng glanced at the spectacle before making his way into one of the palaces. While he rarely entered cities nowadays, he had already encountered quite a few people impersonating him.<br>From that, it wasn&rsquo;t hard to imagine just how many people were impersonating him in the True Dragon Starfield. However, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t too bothered by it. He never cared about how others saw him.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha, Chu Feng! I realized that most of the people impersonating you are quite ugly. They seem to think that you look like that!&rdquo; Milady Queen teased.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good too. It&rsquo;ll be troublesome if the world knows about my true appearance. I&rsquo;ll get many women swooning over me. That would spell many more love rivals for you,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Pui! You must have not looked in the mirror for a long time,&rdquo; Eggy retorted. She soon noticed something amiss in his words and quickly added, &ldquo;Pui pui pui! What do you mean by love rivals? They would only be love rivals for Zi Ling and the others! It has nothing to do with this Queen!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t respond, but his smile further brightened.<br>A waiter greeted him with a beaming smile, but when he saw Chu Feng&rsquo;s appearance, his face suddenly turned cold.<br>&ldquo;Yet another one trying to get free food? Why are there so many people trying to impersonate Chu Feng!&rdquo; the waiter scoffed.<br></div>
