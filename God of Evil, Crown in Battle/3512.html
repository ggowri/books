        <div> - Kneel And Apologize<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Ruochu, could it be that you also possess a friendly relationship with Grandmaster Liangqiu?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t I heard you mentioning it before?&rdquo; the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked with a smile on his face.<br>In the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, there were extremely few individuals with world spirit techniques surpassing those of Wuming Xingyun. The first person the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief thought of was Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, it is not Grandmaster Liangqiu,&rdquo; Li Ruochu said.<br>&ldquo;Who is it then?&rdquo; asked the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Ruochu, quickly tell us who it is,&rdquo; Li Taiyi also asked anxiously.<br>&ldquo;Elder Taiyi, you know this individual. It could even be said that you possess quite a relationship with him,&rdquo; Li Ruochu looked to Li Taiyi in a meaningful manner.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Berserker Li and the others all looked to Li Taiyi.<br>As for Li Taiyi, his gaze changed. He began to wonder who it might be from the grand individuals that he knew of, could possibly possess such exquisite world spirit techniques that they were comparable to Wuming Xingyun, or even more powerful.<br>However, even after wracking his brains thinking about it, he was unable to think of an individual that could match that description.<br>Although Li Taiyi was a Supreme Elder of the Li Heavenly Clan, and someone who possessed quite a reputation in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, his status was rather low compared to the truly grand individuals of the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Even if he knew them, they would only be strangers that came to associate by chance. He had never truly possessed any friendship with those grand individuals.<br>&ldquo;Ruochu, stop beating around the bush, just tell us directly who it is,&rdquo; Li Taiyi said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Chu Feng,&rdquo; answered Li Ruochu.<br>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br>Li Ruochu&rsquo;s words came like a sudden thunderbolt in the ears of the Li Heavenly Clansmen. They were all astonished.<br>&ldquo;Ruochu, say that again?&rdquo; Someone asked.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng. The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Chu Feng. Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Clamor~~~&rdquo;<br>Li Ruochu&rsquo;s words immediately brought forth a huge ruckus. Shock filled the crowd&rsquo;s eyes and they were momentarily unable to calm their minds.<br>In the beginning, the crowd had thought that they&rsquo;d misheard things. However, after Li Ruochu repeated herself in such a manner, they couldn&rsquo;t even find the grounds to doubt their ears.<br>&ldquo;Ruochu, how could you joke around during our clan&rsquo;s time of crisis?&rdquo; Li Taiyi asked coldly.<br>&ldquo;In order to breach this formation, a sufficient amount of preparation is required. Chu Feng is examining the situation in the surroundings. I&rsquo;ll go and have a look as to how much longer he&rsquo;ll take,&rdquo; after Li Ruochu finished saying those words, she turned around with the intention to leave.<br>However, right at that moment, a voice was suddenly heard, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need.&rdquo;<br>It was Chu Feng. Chu Feng had appeared before the crowd.<br>&ldquo;It really is him?!&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing Chu Feng, the Li Heavenly Clansmen felt even more complicated.<br>Due to the appearance of the Upper Realm Gate, the relationship between the Li Heavenly Clan and the Chu Heavenly Clan had become hostile. Back then, the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations went through the Upper Realm Gate to challenge the Chu Heavenly Clan only to return in utter defeat. This caused the relationship between the two clans to worsen.<br>Furthermore, both the stoppage of the opening of the Upper Realm Gate and the defeat of the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were done by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Impudent Chu Feng! You dare to come to our clan?! You truly have a death wish!&rdquo; Suddenly, a boundless murderous aura shot straight toward Chu Feng.<br>It was Li Taiyi. The hatred Li Taiyi had toward Chu Feng had long been engraved into his bones. Seeing Chu Feng at that moment, how could he possibly show any mercy?<br>However, before Li Taiyi could attack, Berserker Li questioned him, &ldquo;Taiyi, what are you doing? Chu Feng is a guest brought back by Ruochu. If you are to attack him, what sort of situation would you place Ruochu in?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Guest? Lord Berserker, while others might be guests, this Chu Feng is definitely not. Today, we must&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;<br>Before Li Taiyi could finish his words, a furious shout exploded.<br>It was the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Even in a war between two armies, they would not kill the messengers. Besides, we are not yet enemies with the Chu Heavenly Clan. What are you trying to do here? Are you trying to disgrace our Li Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>Li Taiyi lowered his head in silence. It wasn&rsquo;t that he couldn&rsquo;t find grounds to refute the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Merely, he was afraid to do so.<br>At that moment, it was Li Ruochu who spoke. &ldquo;Elder Taiyi wants to avenge his personal grudge. After all, back in the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s remnant&hellip;&rdquo; she coughed delicately.<br>Li Taiyi&rsquo;s expression turned extremely ugly before Li Ruochu even finished her words. After all&hellip; what had happened was an act of extraordinary shame and humiliation for him.<br>&ldquo;Li Ruochu, do you not understand what this Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Ancestral Formation means to our clan? This&hellip; is not only the place that you grew up in, it is also the foundation of all the generations of our clan. How could you bring a person like that here in a time of crisis like this? Exactly what are you thinking? Are you trying to betray our clan?&rdquo; Li Taiyi asked while pointing at Li Ruochu.<br>&ldquo;Elder Taiyi, you shouldn&rsquo;t throw around the label of traitor so casually. Furthermore, I would like to remind you: have you forgotten about all of the things that happened in the remnant that day? Could you have also forgotten about the warning from those two?&rdquo; Li Ruochu asked.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Li Taiyi&rsquo;s expression turned strange.<br>Forgotten? How could he have possibly forgotten about it?<br>Even now, he still remembered the terrifying aura of those two women.<br>However, he was dubious. If those two women truly possessed an extraordinary relationship with Chu Feng, why didn&rsquo;t they kill him directly, and instead decided to leave him, a potential danger, alive?<br>It was precisely because of his suspicion that he would continue to detest Chu Feng.<br>That said, he was actually also afraid. That was the reason why he did not directly attack Chu Feng even after unleashing his murderous aura earlier.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the Li Heavenly Clan is unwilling to welcome me. Big sister Ruochu, since that&rsquo;s the case, I, Chu Feng, shall take my leave,&rdquo; as Chu Feng spoke, he prepared to leave.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng,&rdquo; seeing that, Li Ruochu started to panic. She grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s wrist out of fear that he would really leave.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible for me to stay. However&hellip; that man needs to kneel before me and apologize,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to Li Taiyi.<br>&ldquo;What did he just say? Am I mishearing things?&rdquo; Many of the Li Heavenly Clansmen were endlessly astonished. Even Li Ruochu was not an exception.<br>Who was Li Taiyi? He was a Supreme Elder of the Li Heavenly Clan. To force him to kneel to a person of the younger generation due to a verbal altercation was simply impossible.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, if this old man didn&rsquo;t mishear you, you want him to kneel and apologize to you?&rdquo; Berserker Li asked with a frown. Even he was somewhat displeased.<br>The status Li Taiyi possessed was an unsurpassed honor in their Li Heavenly Clan. To have him kneel before Chu Feng was not just an act of humiliation for Li Taiyi, but also an act of humiliation toward the Li Heavenly Clan.<br>Chu Feng was naturally able to sense the displeased looks on the Li Heavenly Clansmen. However, without any hesitation, he said, &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Li Heavenly Clansmen all looked to Chu Feng with ill intentions in their eyes. This held true for both those of the older generation and the younger generation.<br>Anger filled the expressions with which they looked to Chu Feng. That said, at the same time, they found the situation ridiculous. Chu Feng&rsquo;s demand was simply too excessively rude.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Rght at that moment, a burst of laughter was heard. It was Li Taiyi.<br>There was no longer any trace of anger on his face. Instead, he was smiling with eyes deeply narrowed. He looked to Chu Feng as if he were looking at a fool. &ldquo;Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s one thing for you to want me to apologize to you. Yet, you actually want me to apologize while kneeling? I would like to ask you this: what makes you think you&rsquo;re qualified for me to apologize to you while kneeling?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What makes me think I&rsquo;m qualified?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, dazzling gaseous flames erupted from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body and soared into the sky.<br>&ldquo;That is?!&rdquo;<br>Witnessing that scene, all of the Li Heavenly Clansmen present, regardless of their age, even the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Li Taiyi, who felt great loathing toward Chu Feng, were astonished. Their expressions changed enormously.<br>They were all able to sense that what Chu Feng emitted was spirit power&hellip; very powerful spirit power.<br>Suddenly, an elder said, &ldquo;This spirit power, could it be&hellip; Saint-level spirit power?&rdquo; His voice was actually trembling.<br>&ldquo;What?! Saint-level spirit power?!&rdquo; Hearing those words, all of the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were completely stupefied. Apart from shock, utter perplexity was also present in their eyes.<br>If it was truly Saint-level spirit power, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that Chu Feng was already a&hellip; Saint-cloak World Spiritist?<br>To become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist at such a young age, how could that be possible?<br>That was simply unprecedented in the history of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br></p></div>
