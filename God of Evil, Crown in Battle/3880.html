        <h1>Chapter 3879</h1>
        <div> - Sacrifice<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Mystic Cave Saints were a bunch that valued wealth as much as their lives. Especially treasures. For them, treasures held enormous enticement.<br>One could see how many remnants they&rsquo;d entered, how many mystic places they&rsquo;d explored, and how many treasures they&rsquo;d obtained from how many strange treasures they had on them.<br>It would not be excessive to say that they&rsquo;d entered all sorts of remnants and mystic places.<br>Doing that, it was inevitable that they would encounter many opponents. However, very few people were capable of causing them to fail to obtain any treasures.<br>That said, they&rsquo;d encountered an extremely powerful opponent in the past too. As for that person, he was the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted could be said to be a true expert.<br>His strength lay not merely in his cultivation and world spirit techniques.<br>He was also extremely experienced in exploring remnants and utilizing treasures.<br>It could be said that the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was an expert tomb robber, an expert tomb robber superior even to the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>He was able to discover the remnant&rsquo;s main formation&rsquo;s formation core in a very short period of time, and gain control over the remnant&rsquo;s power.<br>Practically all the remnants that the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted appeared in meant that others had lost their chance to gain anything from them.<br>Even the Mystic Cave Saints were unable to compete with him in the slightest.<br>Back then, the Mystic Cave Saints had suffered miserably at his hands.<br>That was the reason why they were so shocked and frightened when they saw the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted again.<br>Their defeat from back then was still vivid in their minds. That defeat had left an enormous shadow in their hearts.<br>&ldquo;Who would&rsquo;ve known that the All-heaven Sect would actually manage to invite that Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Big brother, what are we supposed to do now?&rdquo; asked Eleventh.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic. When we were defeated by him last time, even I, was only an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Things are completely different now. We brothers have increased our world spirit techniques, and we&rsquo;ve also gained a decisive opportunity by obtaining the acknowledgement of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor. We now possess the power of this tomb&rsquo;s grand formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For him to show up here today, it will serve as the best opportunity for us to get our revenge," said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We&rsquo;ve been acknowledged by the Great Monster Slayer Emperor. We possess the power of this place&rsquo;s grand formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Haha. Truly the heavens help us. For that Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted to show up here now. The heavens have truly prepared a perfect opportunity for us brothers to get our revenge.&rdquo;<br>The others of the Mystic Cave Saints came to a sudden realization after hearing what their eldest brother said.<br>They no longer felt any fear. Instead, they began to look forward to the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s arrival. One by one, they became extremely excited.<br>&ldquo;The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted came to our All-heaven Sect as a guest. He has merely come here to check things out today. He will not be doing anything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, we will have to trouble grandmasters with breaching the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb,&rdquo; said Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve long heard of the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s famed name. It is my honor to meet him today. But, am I not able to see the famed Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted face-to-face?&rdquo; as Grandmaster Ouyang spoke, he had a slight tone of regret.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>As for Grandmaster Huang, he let out a cold snort. There was a different sort of connotation in his snort.<br>Furthermore, after letting out that cold snort, he seemed to want to say something. However, in the end, he hesitated, and didn&rsquo;t say anything.<br>&ldquo;Forget about it. Since we&rsquo;ve taken the money, we&rsquo;ll naturally have to complete the task.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will not concern myself with other things.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brother Ouyang, let us begin.&rdquo; Grandmaster Huang held the compass in his hand and looked towards Grandmaster Ouyang, who nodded.<br>Following that, the two of them began to utilize the compass to search for flaws in the spirit formation around the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>Soon, they discovered a flaw. Using their world spirit techniques, they breached that flaw.<br>A spirit formation entrance appeared before the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Success! Lord Supreme Elder, we&rsquo;ve finally succeeded!&rdquo;<br>Seeing the spirit formation gate that appeared before them, the elders of the All-heaven Sect were all overwhelmingly excited.<br>After all, they&rsquo;d tried to breach the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb multiple times over the years. However, without exception, they&rsquo;d always conclude in failure.<br>And now, the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb had really been breached. It would only be natural for them to be endlessly excited.<br>At that moment, the people from the All-heaven Sect were all eager to move. Should Tuoba Chengan give the order, they would immediately enter the spirit formation entrance.<br>They were all itching to see exactly what sort of treasures were in the mysterious Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>&ldquo;The compass&rsquo; pointer is swaying nonstop. It is impossible to determine if the entrance is safe.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I suggest we explore things.&rdquo;<br>As Grandmaster Huang spoke, he opened his palm, and a total of one hundred talismans appeared in his hand.<br>&ldquo;Stick the talisman paper onto your dantians and enter. Regardless of life or death, I will be able to sense it.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Huang handed the talismans to Tuoba Chengan.<br>Seeing that, the people of the All-heaven Sect that were extremely excited and eager to enter the opened entrance were immediately dumbfounded.<br>Even a fool could tell that Grandmaster Huang wanted Tuoba Chengan to find some people to enter the spirit formation entrance.<br>Why would he want people to enter the spirit formation entrance?<br>The purpose was very simple&mdash;to die.<br>As it was impossible to determine if the interior was safe, he wanted people to go in and explore things.<br>If it was safe, they would be able to return safely. However, if it wasn&rsquo;t safe, they would be throwing their lives away.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Huang, we asked you to come here so that you could breach this spirit formation and determine the dangers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could you have us go in and explore the path?&rdquo; complained a Supreme Elder of the All-heaven Sect.<br>&ldquo;The compass is unstable. It is unknown if there are dangers inside, yet you want us to go in and explore things?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Disregarding the rewards, if something is to happen to us, who would dare help you all breach this Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Huang.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; The elders of the All-heaven Sect were all at a loss as for how to respond.<br>&ldquo;Lingxiong.&rdquo; [1. Lingxiong could mean either Brother Ling or Esteemed Brother. Or&hellip; it could be the dude&rsquo;s name.]<br>Right at that moment, Tuoba Chengan turned his gaze behind him to the bunch wearing black gowns and masks.<br>Once Tuoba Chengan spoke, a person immediately passed through the crowd and arrived beside Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;Milord.&rdquo;<br>That person immediately clasped his fist respectfully after arriving beside Tuoba Chengan.<br>That said, he merely clasped his fist, and did not bend his back or get on his knees.<br>&ldquo;Lingxiong, you heard what Grandmaster Huang said earlier, no?&rdquo; asked Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;I have. But&hellip;&rdquo; That person hesitated.<br>After all, this was a matter that concerned life and death. No one would be willing to do such a risky thing.<br>Knowing what Tuoba Chengan wanted him to do, he would naturally not be willing to accept the mission.<br>&ldquo;The help you needed from us is quite extensive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that you all are unwilling to even pay such a small price?&rdquo; asked Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I understand,&rdquo; that man came to a decision.<br>He accepted the hundred talisman papers, selected a hundred people from the group of black-clothed mask-wearing men, and told them to place the talismans on their dantians.<br>The men he selected were very obedient. Even though they knew they might die, no one voiced any complaints.<br>Then, at the same time, those people entered the spirit formation entrance opened by the two grandmaster world spiritists.<br>However, they had only entered the spirit formation entrance for a short period of time when the compass started trembling violently.<br>Seeing that, the two grandmaster world spiritists started frowning. A look of alarm appeared on their faces.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this dangerous?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t possibly shoulder such a task.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll return you your reward.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Ouyang took out the reward he had accepted earlier and tossed it to Tuoba Chengan.<br>No matter how Tuoba Chengan tried to urge him to stay, it was useless.<br>That Grandmaster Ouyang soared into the sky and, in the blink of an eye, disappeared far away.<br>He had fled extremely quickly.<br>However, that was not what was important. What was important was how panicked he was. That was something witnessed by everyone present.<br>From his reaction, the crowd knew that the hundred people that had entered the entrance earlier must&rsquo;ve all died.<br>Furthermore, the danger level of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb was much greater than they&rsquo;d anticipated. Otherwise, how could a grandmaster world spiritist bolt like that?<br>&ldquo;Elder Tuoba, I am not trying to make things difficult for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, the level of danger this time has far exceeded my anticipation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if we have the assistance of the compass, it will still be very difficult to open the true entrance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You will have to increase the reward,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Huang.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, go ahead and tell me how much more you want,&rdquo; said Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;Ten times more,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Huang.<br></p></div>
