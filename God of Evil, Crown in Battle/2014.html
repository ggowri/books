        <div> - The Unfavorable Battle Situation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>After the banquet, the Underworld Palace, the King Monstrous Dragon Race and the Four Great Imperial Clans all began to leave in succession. After all, apart from the Four Great Imperial Clans, both the Underworld Palace and the King Monstrous Dragon Race had dispatched all of their troops to assist the Cyanwood Mountain. As such, they were afraid of retaliations from the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace, and had to return in order to guard their homes.<br>At that moment, Lord Luokong called for Lord Lianghua and Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Lord Luokong, might something have happened?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked. He was already able to tell that Lord Luokong seemed to be occupied with something in his mind. For Lord Luokong to call for Lord Lianghua and him, Chu Feng knew that something must&rsquo;ve happened.<br>&ldquo;Actually, it&rsquo;s hard for me to say this. However, when considering the general situation, I must say it&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, I must bring Lianghua away with me,&rdquo; Lord Luokong said.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that the battle between the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves and the Dark Hall has become unfavorable?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Before the Moonlight Maze, the Dark Hall was merely trying to pin us Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves down. However, after that battle in the Moonlight Maze, they have unleashed their true strength against us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Dark Hall is very powerful; so powerful that they have surpassed our imagination. Furthermore, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts are being thrown onto the battlefield nonstop. As such, we urgently need Lianghua&rsquo;s return to assist with the defense,&rdquo; Lord Luokong said.<br>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves possess a method to curb the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts? Are they not effective anymore?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves had suffered at the hands of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts in the Moonlight Maze. Chu Feng felt that it was mainly because they did not expect the appearance of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts.<br>However, the Dark Hall had now unleashed an all-out attack against the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, and were attacking various strategic locations nonstop.<br>Furthermore, after the events in the Moonlight Maze, they had begun to widely utilize the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts in their attacks. In that sort of situation, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves should have already started to use the golden bells that could contain the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts.<br>Yet now, the battle was still extremely unfavorable for them. This could only mean one thing -- that the golden bells were no longer effective against the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts.<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re no longer effective. We don&rsquo;t know what the Dark Hall has done to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts. Right now, we Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves no longer possess any way to contain them. As such, we can only fight them head-on,&rdquo; Lord Luokong shook his head and sighed.<br>&ldquo;It turns out that we have underestimated the Dark Hall,&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Feng started to frown.<br>In the past, they had thought the entire time that the Dark Hall was afraid of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves. However now, it was the Dark Hall that was attacking the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves.<br>If even the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves could not withstand the Dark Hall, how could anyone in the Holy Land of Martialism possibly be able to withstand the Dark Hall?<br>Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s sullen expression, Lord Luokong thought that what Chu Feng was worried about was there not being anyone to protect the Cyanwood Mountain after Lord Lianghua left.<br>Thus, he said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, I have led all these people here because I was ordered by His Majesty to bring everyone from the Cyanwood Mountain into our Elf Kingdom. There is a grand formation from the Ancient Era in our Elf Kingdom. In there, you all will be absolutely safe.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Luokong, there&rsquo;s no need for that. While the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves could protect our Cyanwood Mountain temporarily, they cannot protect us forever. You can take Lord Lianghua with you without worrying about us. As for the Cyanwood Mountain, I will be able to protect this place,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You can protect the Cyanwood Mountain?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Lord Luokong was startled.<br>Although Chu Feng&rsquo;s current strength was very strong, Lord Luokong knew the strength of the Dark Hall after having fought them several times. Not to mention Chu Feng, if the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master were to attack the Cyanwood Mountain, even Lord Lianghua would not be a match for him.<br>They were currently in a passive state, and did not even know the location of the Dark Hall&rsquo;s headquarters.<br>Yet, the various strategic locations of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves were all openly known.<br>The Dark Hall was able to attack them at any time they wished. They could attack any one of those many locations they wished.<br>As such, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves could only act passively, and allow themselves to be attacked without actually being able to attack the Dark Hall.<br>Therefore&hellip; if the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master were to personally attack the Cyanwood Mountain, the Cyanwood Mountain would definitely be extinguished.<br>&ldquo;Lord Luokong, I have managed to create a spirit formation. That spirit formation is capable of withstanding attacks from peak Martial Emperors.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And now, with seniors Weaponry Refinement Immortal, Immeasurable Immortal, Snow-haired Immortal and Zhang Ming here to assist me, I am ninety percent certain that I will be able to successfully set up that spirit formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, you can bring Lord Lianghua back without worrying about our Cyanwood Mountain,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Truly? You&rsquo;ve managed to create such a powerful spirit formation?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Lord Luokong was astonished.<br>&ldquo;Absolutely. Why would I joke with Senior Luokong about something like this?&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, exactly how many more abilities do you have that I do not know of?&rdquo; Lord Luokong gasped in admiration. He was able to tell that Chu Feng was not joking. However, it was precisely because Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t joking with him that he exclaimed in admiration at Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent.<br>A spirit formation capable of withstanding attacks from peak Martial Emperors. While their Elf Kingdom possessed such a spirit formation, it was something that only their Elf Kingdom possessed.<br>That spirit formation was set up by the ancestors of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, and was said to have originated from the Ancient Era. However, Chu Feng had actually managed to create such a spirit formation. This was truly an unimaginable feat.<br>&ldquo;If that spirit formation is successfully set up, our Cyanwood Mountain will also do what an ally should do. We will go and assist the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>As the battle had already started, although Chu Feng was worried for his friends&rsquo; safety, he knew that they could not turtle up in here. As allies, they should go and fight alongside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves.<br>Although there would be casualties by joining the battle, and those who were close to Chu Feng might even be killed, Chu Feng had to participate in this battle.<br>Furthermore, as long as Chu Feng joined the battle, those who were related to him would also join the battle.<br>This was an unavoidable battle, for this battle would determine the life and death of all beings in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>Chu Feng knew very well that if the Dark Hall wasn&rsquo;t eliminated, there would be many more people dying in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>If the Dark Hall were to win the battle, it was likely that a calamity would engulf the entire Holy Land of Martialism.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, then we Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves shall await your arrival,&rdquo; Lord Luokong patted Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulder. He was moved from the bottom of his heart.<br>He had come to the Cyanwood Mountain straight from the battlefield. Thus, he knew very well what sort of situation they, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, were in.<br>Although the Cyanwood Mountain was incomparable to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, it was still a place filled with experts. If the Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s experts were capable of joining the battle, it would be of great assistance to the current Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves.<br>After this matter was decided, Lord Luokong and Lord Lianghua left with the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; army.<br>After all, they were currently in a critical battle against the Dark Hall. Thus, they did not wish to delay their return.<br>After Lord Luokong and Lord Lianghua left, it was already very late into the night. However, Chu Feng was unable to sleep. He was still worrying about Su Rou and Su Mei.<br>With his heart distracted and his thoughts in turmoil, Chu Feng walked to the outside of the Cyanwood Mountain to find a peaceful place to calm his heart.<br>When Chu Feng arrived at a lakeside, he discovered a familiar silhouette. It was the Snow Blade Mad Demon.<br>&ldquo;Senior Snow Blade?&rdquo; Upon seeing the Snow Blade Mad Demon, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed slightly.<br>The reason for that was because not only was the Snow Blade Mad Demon standing by the lakeside, he also had several memorial tablets placed before him. Before the memorial tablets were many offerings.<br>Evidently, the Snow Blade Mad Demon was holding an offering to some people.<br>But&hellip; that was not the important aspect. Most importantly, Chu Feng discovered that the Snow Blade Mad Demon, this old man who had lived for thousands of years, actually had tears streaming down his cheeks.<br><br></p></div>
