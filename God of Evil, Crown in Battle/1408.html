        <h1>Chapter 1408</h1>
        <div> - The Arrogant Woman<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>A vast crowd was gathered outside of the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s largest plaza.<br>Practically everyone from the World Spiritist Alliance had come. People were everywhere, filling up one&rsquo;s entire line of sight. Both the sky and the ground were covered with silhouettes. This sort of disposition of forces was truly frightening. It was a display of the might of one of the peak powers in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>At this moment, not only were there a lot of people gathered on the plaza, they were also all the highest-standing characters in the World Spiritist Alliance.<br>Naturally, the management world spiritists were all present. However, even the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master, who had been in closed-doors training all this time, had shown himself.<br>The World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master was about as old as Miao Renlong. He had lived for a very long time and experienced a great amount of changes.<br>However, he had a head of blond hair and a very long blond beard. It was truly attention-grabbing.<br>Compared to Miao Renlong, this World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master&rsquo;s appearance was truly more domineering.<br>At this moment, this World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master&rsquo;s gaze was focused on two people in the center of the plaza.<br>To be exact, the gazes of practically everyone present were fixed on those two people.<br>Especially Chu Feng; he had even activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to inspect those two individuals.<br>That was because those two people were no ordinary people. The reason why the World Spiritist Alliance had unleashed such an enormous disposition of forces was all because of the two of them.<br>The two of them had donned black cloaks that completely covered their entire bodies. Even their eyes were hidden within their cloaks. The only thing that was visible was their stature.<br>The person with a relatively tall height was an old man. His identity was unknown, and his strength was extremely powerful. He was the person who the World Spiritist Alliance feared the most.<br>As for the person with a relatively shorter height, she was the mysterious royal-cloak world spiritist woman who had defeated Fu Feiteng and many of the other geniuses.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how is it? Did you manage to see their appearances?&rdquo; Sima Ying knew that Chu Feng had grasped a special method. Thus, she was unable to help herself from asking him if he had managed to find anything.<br>&ldquo;There are protective formations within their cloaks. Those formations are too powerful. I am unable to see anything,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay. After all, we will definitely determine their identities after today,&rdquo; Sima Ying said.<br>&ldquo;Yoh, Lil Sis Ying&rsquo;er, how come you&rsquo;re suddenly this confident?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Heh, you&rsquo;ll know soon. Our World Spiritist Alliance is prepared this time around,&rdquo; In a prideful manner, Sima Ying held her chest forward and laughed in a very sweet manner. She actually tried to be suspenseful.<br>&ldquo;Oh you girl. I shall see exactly what sorts of preparations you all have made,&rdquo; Hearing those words and seeing Sima Ying&rsquo;s actions, Chu Feng smiled lightly and asked no further. Instead, he once again turned his gaze to that mysterious woman.<br>&ldquo;Strange, for some unknown reason, I am having a special feeling from her?&rdquo; Chu Feng muttered in his heart.<br>Hearing what Chu Feng said, Eggy was immediately interested. With a mischievous smile on her face, she asked, &ldquo;Ahhah, a special feeling? What kind of special feeling? Could it be that you are tempted by her?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hard to say. If I had to describe it, then it would be a very familiar sort of feeling. I keep feeling that I know her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Ridiculous. You haven&rsquo;t even managed to see her face, yet you recognize her? The way I see it, you will receive a familiar feeling from all of the powerful women in this world, right? It&rsquo;s not that you know them already, but rather that you&rsquo;ll come to know them, right? Heh&hellip;&rdquo; The mischievous smile on Eggy&rsquo;s face grew even denser. However, she was very lovely.<br>&ldquo;Oh you girl, why are you describing me as if I were a great pervert?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in a rather helpless manner.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not?&rdquo; Eggy curled her lips.<br>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m not. If I were a great prevert, how could I possibly be letting you get away from my perverted hands?&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a mischievous smile.<br>&ldquo;You dare?!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you dare to think about doing something to this queen here, this queen will let you know what it means by feeling better to die, living in hell,&rdquo; Eggy did not get angry. Instead, she spoke to Chu Feng in a very fierce and malicious manner.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng did not say anymore. Instead, he involuntarily trembled. That was because he knew very well about the methods of Her Lady Queen Eggy. That dark black energy was like the representative of the utmost evil. Asura, it was most definitely a fully justified reputation.<br>In short, while all of the women in this world could be provoked, only Her Lady Queen Eggy could not.<br>&ldquo;Can we start now?&rdquo; Right at this moment, that mysterious woman spoke.<br>Even though her voice was very pleasant to hear, it had clearly been especially altered. Thus, everyone knew that this was not the actual voice of this woman.<br>However, even though this was not her actual voice, the crowd was still able to tell that she should be a young person.<br>However, compared to her age, the people of the World Spiritist Alliance were more dissatisfied with her tone. After all, this was their territory. Furthermore, even their World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master was present.<br>Yet, this girl&rsquo;s tone was so disrespectful and arrogant. Without even bothering to greet them, she had directly entered the main topic. This was truly too arrogant.<br>Compared to the others, the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master was not angered. Instead, with a beaming smile, he asked, &ldquo;Little friend, you are truly an impatient person. However, would it be possible for you to reveal your true appearance during the time of the match so that we can know exactly which power&rsquo;s genius has managed to consecutively defeat so many of our World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s geniuses?&rdquo; His tolerance was truly contrary to the manners of a ruler.<br>However, although he said those words to the mysterious woman, he had actually cast his gaze to the man standing beside the mysterious woman.<br>In reality, what he wanted to know the most was not the identity of that mysterious woman. Instead, he wanted to know who that old man behind that mysterious woman was.<br>&ldquo;You wish to know who we are? Sure, it&rsquo;s not like we cannot reveal ourselves to you. Merely, you would have to defeat Lil Mei first,&rdquo; That old man spoke with an aged and hoarse voice.<br>His voice was vigorous, powerful and very domineering. Merely, his voice gave off a sensation of looking down on everyone.<br>That old man had truly not placed anyone present in his eyes. That included even the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master.<br>&ldquo;Haha, very well. In that case, let&rsquo;s begin. It just so happens that the members of our World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s younger generation are unable to continue waiting either.&rdquo;<br>The World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master laughed out loud. After that, he waved his sleeve and nine figures flew out from the crowd before landing at the center of the plaza.<br>These nine people were the nine geniuses on the World Spiritist Succession List. Headed by Lin Yezhou, the nine of them stood in a uniform row.<br>At this moment, Lin Yezhou and Fu Feiteng had changed to their royal world spiritist cloaks. Being such young royal-cloak world spiritists, the two of them gave off very imposing airs and attracted the attention of the crowd.<br>The mysterious woman took a glance at the people other than Lin Yezhou and Fu Feiteng and stopped her gaze at Zhao Kai, Chen Mu and the others before issuing a very disdainful voice, &ldquo;The gold cloak world spiritists plan to join too? Could it be that you all think that you&rsquo;re capable of winning?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Hearing those words, Zhao Kai, Chen Mu and the others started to frown. They were deeply enraged.<br>However, even though they felt very angry, none of them said anything back. Instead, they all turned their gazes to the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master. They wanted to have their Alliance Master decide what to do.<br>At this moment, the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s Alliance Master lightly nodded his head to indicate for them to withdraw.<br>When even their Alliance Master declared for them to withdraw, even though Zhao Kai and the others were unwilling, they would not dare to disobey. As such, one after another, they left the plaza and returned to where they had previously stood.<br>At this moment, although nothing had really happened, the egos of the World Spiritist Alliance&rsquo;s disciples were all wounded. No matter what, Zhao Kai and the others were the few strongest geniuses of the World Spiritist Alliance. Yet, at this time, they were actually looked down upon by someone in such a manner. This was not only a humiliation to them, it was a humiliation to all the people of their World Spiritist Alliance.<br>At this moment, only Lin Yezhou and Fu Feiteng remained on the plaza. Both of them were royal-cloak world spiritists like her.<br>However, when that mysterious woman spoke again, the crowd from the World Spiritist Alliance once again felt a great sense of humiliation.<br>&ldquo;I do not wish to waste time, both of you, come at me together,&rdquo; The mysterious woman said.<br></p></div>
