        <div>: The Same Surname<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother asked.<br>&ldquo;Have you not noticed that these three lakes aren&rsquo;t supposed to be in their current states?&rdquo; the bizarre-looking woman asked.<br>&ldquo;Elder, what do you mean?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is Chu Feng&rsquo;s intentional actions that you were able to see through the secrets hidden in the lakes so easily. The runes at the bottom of the lakes should have been concealed discreetly, but that lad deciphered those secrets and exposed them out,&rdquo; the bizarre-looking woman said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, what you mean to say is that Chu Feng has been helping me all this while?&rdquo; the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother exclaimed in astonishment.<br>To that question, the bizarre-looking woman simply smiled faintly in response before turning around and disappearing once more.<br>She really left the area this time, leaving behind the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother in a dilemma.<br>She found it hard to swallow all of this all of a sudden.<br>She did carry deep admiration for Chu Feng, but after she realized that she had been deceived, her admiration turned into rage. That was also why she treated Chu Feng coldly even after she was saved by him.<br>However, she realized that she had wronged him all this while. He hadn&rsquo;t approached her with a hidden agenda in mind.<br>This realization left her with a bitter feeling inside. She felt ashamed and guilty, but at the same time, she was moved as well.<br>And more than that, she was astounded.<br>&hellip;<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng had already left the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Tomb of Armaments through the white lake, returning all the way back to the desert.<br>By the time he came back, Long Xiaoxiao, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster, those from the Cloudsky Immortal Sect, and those from the Yu Heavenly clan were already in the desert.<br>All of them initially had heavy looks on their faces, but upon seeing Chu Feng, they were taken aback for an instant before exultant joy erupted on their faces.<br>Most people began to cheer excitedly, and even the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster and the Supreme Elders of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect stepped forward to thank Chu Feng personally.<br>Even the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had directed a deep bow of gratitude toward him.<br>As for why they were reacting in such a manner, needless to say, it was because Chu Feng was their savior.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, did you manage to obtain anything from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Tomb of Armaments?&rdquo; an elder from the Yu Heavenly Clan suddenly asked Chu Feng.<br>As soon as those words sounded, it felt like even the air in the surroundings had stopped moving. Countless eyes brimming with anticipation fell on Chu Feng.<br>The crowd was initially still worried about Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety, but after seeing that he had escaped out of that perilous place alive, curiosity began sprouting in their minds. They were curious to know whether Chu Feng had gotten anything good out of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Tomb of Armaments.<br>While they were waiting for Chu Feng out here in the desert, they had discussed many matters with one another. From their exchange of information, the crowd managed to gain a basic understanding of what the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Tomb of Armaments was.<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Tomb of Armaments was a place of the legends. There were many myths regarding this place.<br>It was said that there were many courageous adventurers who ventured into that place in search of a fortuitous encounter, but only a small handful of them managed to escape with their lives.<br>Far too many renowned powerful cultivators had lost their lives in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Tomb of Armaments, and that was also the reason why the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others showed deep terror when they realized that they had been brought there.<br>But despite the dangers lurking inside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Tomb of Armaments, there were still some incredibly lucky individuals who managed to get something good out of there.<br>And the items that they had obtained were all at least at the level of Incomplete Exalted Armaments, incredibly powerful ones at that.<br>There were even rumors that some had managed to acquire Exalted Armaments from there, and those Exalted Armaments were of top-notch quality.<br>Due to this, some cultivators even dubbed the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Tomb of Armaments as a place where the strongest weapons were resting in wait for a qualified master.<br>Given so, it was inevitable that the crowd gathered would be curious whether Chu Feng would be one of those lucky individuals.<br>After all, despite his young age, Chu Feng was an incredibly talented individual. Given the means he had displayed thus far, everyone felt that there was a really good chance that he might have been able to obtain something good from there.<br>&ldquo;To be honest, I did manage to get something out of my trip into the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Tomb of Armaments,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, did you manage to obtain a decent weapon from there?&rdquo;<br>The crowd quickly asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still not too sure about it. I&rsquo;ll need to look into it first, but for the time being, it doesn&rsquo;t look like I&rsquo;ll be able to use the weapon I acquired,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, why don&rsquo;t you take it out so that we can take a look at it for you?&rdquo; an elder from the Yu Heavenly Clan asked.<br>As soon as the elder said those words, the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster bellowed furiously at him, &ldquo;What nonsense are you rambling over there? Who do you think you are to ask young friend Chu Feng to show you his treasure?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah! Pardon me, I don&rsquo;t mean anything by those words!&rdquo;<br>Realizing that he had made an extremely insolent request, the elder quickly apologized and explained himself.<br>&ldquo;What young friend Chu Feng obtained is his own business, we shouldn&rsquo;t probe too much into it. We might have our grudges with him in the past, but there&rsquo;s no doubt that the reason why we&rsquo;re still standing here right now is due to him putting his life on the line for us. We should be thanking heaven that he managed to return alive, or else we would have to live with guilt for the rest of our lives!&rdquo; the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief berated the elder who spoke up earlier.<br>Following that, he turned to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, the words I have spoken to you still stand. We might be of different surnames, but from this day onward, any problem you face will be our problem too! If anyone dares to provoke you, you can be assured that our Yu Heavenly Clan will not stand still!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The same goes for our Monstrous Herd Temple as well! Young friend Chu Feng, as long as you give the word, we&rsquo;ll brave through hell for you!&rdquo; the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster roared in agreement.<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak on the behalf of our Cloudsky Immortal Sect, but I hereby declare that anyone who is an enemy of young friend Chu Feng will be my enemy as well!&rdquo;<br>The two Supreme Elders of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect also quickly made their stand known.<br>&ldquo;Elders, I am deeply thankful for your sentiments.&rdquo;<br>Instead of standing on ceremony and rejecting their help, Chu Feng clasped his fist to express his gratitude toward them.<br>He knew that he was still weak compared to the top powers in the Holy Light Galaxy, and his master, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, still had a powerful enemy that he had to deal with.<br>If these colossuses were really willing to lend him a hand, that would be for the best.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to thank us for. If anything, we should be the ones to thank you instead. In truth, our clan has come to a decision on a matter earlier, and we believe that it&rsquo;s to the benefit of all of us present here,&rdquo; the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? What good news is it?&rdquo; the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster asked.<br>&ldquo;To be frank with all of you, there&rsquo;s a place which our Yu Heavenly Clan is intending to head to in the Nine Souls Galaxy. If we manage to successfully open that place, we might be able to obtain something good from them.<br>&ldquo;I was intending to bring just our clan members over, but I think that it is the design of fate that brought all of us here together and put us through the tribulation earlier. So, I believe that it would be best if we could head there together.<br>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, I would like to invite all of you to come along with us to that place. If we manage to acquire anything good from that place, we&rsquo;ll share it with one another. If not, we can just treat it as a leisure trip. What do you say?&rdquo; the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Sounds good. I&rsquo;m in!&rdquo;<br>The Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster and the Supreme Elders of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect immediately agreed to it.<br>&ldquo;Looks like we owe this stroke of good luck to young friend Chu Feng. May I ask what kind of place we&rsquo;re heading to?&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;Interestingly, the previous owner of that place shares the same surname as young friend Chu Feng,&rdquo; the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;That person&rsquo;s surname is Chu too? What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;Chu Hanxian,&rdquo; the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief replied.<br></p></div>
