        <div> - The Promise Between Father And Son<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re worried, you could directly bring him with you. There&rsquo;s no need to temper him through experience by himself, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to help him, he will grow at least ten times faster than he is now,&rdquo; Old Ape said.<br>It could be seen that Old Ape was somewhat reluctant to part with Chu Feng. He did not wish for Chu Feng to face the challenges in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm by himself. After all, the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was over a hundred times more dangerous than the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>&ldquo;If I am to help him, he will indeed be able to become an expert capable of traveling about unhindered through the Starfields in a short period of time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, that will become his limit. He will not be able to become a character that can move about unhindered through the entire Outer World,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;But, didn&rsquo;t you help Zi Ling?&rdquo; The Old Ape said.<br>&ldquo;Feng&rsquo;er is different from Zi Ling. Zi Ling&rsquo;s talent is limited. I must help her increase her talent. Only by doing so can she have a chance to chase after Feng&rsquo;er.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for Feng&rsquo;er, he is very talented. Even without my help, he will most definitely be able to steadily mature.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, it is only through being left to one&rsquo;s own devices without the assistance of others that he will be able to create his own martial cultivation path.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Only through finding a martial cultivation path that belongs to him, and which is not just a duplicate of another will he be able to walk further,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;In the end, it&rsquo;s all because it&rsquo;s you. If it were another father, they would most definitely not be willing to do something like this,&rdquo; Old Ape grumbled.<br>&ldquo;One day, Feng&rsquo;er will understand that I am doing this for his own good,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;But, back then, you promised Chu Feng&rsquo;s mother that you would properly protect Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If Chu Feng&rsquo;s mother is to find out that you consider your protection of Chu Feng to be something like this, she might end up killing you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, if his mother were to find out that her son is actually enduring all sorts of hardships in a distant Starfield, she would likely massacre her way here and forcibly retrieve Chu Feng,&rdquo; Old Ape said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;According to her temperament, that is indeed possible. However&hellip; she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do that. After all, she is confined by&hellip;&rdquo; As he said those words, Chu Xuanyuan started to tightly clench his fists. The expression of his gaze had changed.<br>The surrounding temperature started to plummet. Layers of frost appeared on the ground whilst Snowflakes emerged in the sky.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng, who was lying on the ground started to shiver involuntarily. Even Old Ape felt a chill through his bones.<br>&ldquo;Xuanyuan,&rdquo; Old Ape immediately patted Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s shoulder with his hand.<br>It was only at that moment that Chu Xuanyuan noticed the changes that had occurred to their surroundings. His expression started to ease, and he began to emit a gentle aura. The snowflakes that covered the sky started to disappear. The frost that covered the ground also started to disappear.<br>&ldquo;Everyone possesses an Achilles&rsquo; heel. As for yours, it is her. Forget about it, I will not mention her again before you,&rdquo; Old Ape said in a helpless manner.<br>He knew Chu Xuanyuan very well. Thus, he knew that he was a very calm and cool-headed individual.<br>However, whenever Chu Feng&rsquo;s mother was mentioned, Chu Xuanyuan would lose control of his emotions.<br>Suddenly, Chu Xuanyuan said, &ldquo;One day, I will definitely rescue her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Xuanyuan, don&rsquo;t be reckless. Her clan is not one to be trifled with,&rdquo; Old Ape advised him against it.<br>The place that confined Chu Feng&rsquo;s mother was actually her home. She was confined by her clan.<br>Merely, the clan that Chu Feng&rsquo;s mother belonged to was truly no small matter.<br>Her clan was not the ruler of an Upper Realm, nor was it the ruler of a Starfield.<br>Instead, they were a power renowned throughout the entire Outer World. Her clan was truly a huge monster. It was a monster that stood at the apex of the Outer World, and was revered by various Starfields and other powers.<br>Although the Chu Heavenly Clan was the ruler of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they were simply incomparable against Chu Feng&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s clan.<br>Even the current Chu Xuanyuan would not be a match for them.<br>The disparity between them could even be said to be enormous.<br>&ldquo;If I wanted to act recklessly, I would&rsquo;ve done it back then. I wouldn&rsquo;t have waited till today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, I know very well. With her talent and status, even if she is confined by her clan, they will not truly harm her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as she is in good health, I will have sufficient time to increase my cultivation. Regardless of how powerful her clan might be, I will definitely be able to confront them one day...&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, the top priority right now is to find my father,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;You investigated your father before. However, the result you obtained was not optimistic at all. If you plan to continue with your investigation, you will have to confront unknown dangers. Are you certain that you want to do this?&rdquo; Old Ape asked.<br>&ldquo;I must do this,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan replied in a very determined manner.<br>&ldquo;Do you really think your father is still alive?&rdquo; Old Ape asked.<br>&ldquo;I cannot be certain,&rdquo; as Chu Xuanyuan said those words, a trace of sadness appeared in his eyes. Then, he said, &ldquo;However, if he is alive, I must see him. If he is dead, I must see his corpse.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Then, even though we&rsquo;re not going to bring Chu Feng with us, are we not going to bring Zi Ling with us?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent is obvious to the eyes. Through the many years of trials he has experienced, he has indeed matured greatly. He possesses the ability to experience and endure trials and tribulations by himself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Zi Ling is inferior to Chu Feng. Yet, you want her to go train by herself too. What if some sort of accident is to happen to her? How are you to explain that to Chu Feng?&rdquo; The Old Ape asked.<br>&ldquo;Zi Ling is, after all, my disciple. If she is unable to endure this bit of difficulty, I will have taught her in vain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Moreover, it is Zi Ling herself who chose to go and train there. Even if an accident is to happen, I cannot be blamed for it,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;I have never met a master as ruthless and cold-hearted as you,&rdquo; Old Ape shook his head helplessly.<br>&ldquo;Wuuu~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng let out a light groan. His tightly closed eyes trembled slightly.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is about to awaken. It is time for us to go,&rdquo; Old Ape said.<br>However, not only did Chu Xuanyuan not leave, but he instead walked over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s side.<br>Then, he waved his sleeve and the surrounding scenery instantly changed.<br>The surrounding scenery changed to that of the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm&rsquo;s Heavenly Road. It was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s forbidden area.<br>Then, Chu Xuanyuan gently stroked Chu Feng&rsquo;s hair. Chu Feng&rsquo;s tightly closed eyes trembled slightly. Then, they slowly opened.<br>Chu Feng had awakened.<br>&ldquo;Father, is it really you?&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Xuanyuan, Chu Feng was overjoyed. He did not dare believe what he saw. He began to rub his eyes repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;Feng&rsquo;er, do you still remember the promise between you and father?&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan asked.<br>[1. Chu Xuanyuan is referring to himself in the third person. In chinese, it&rsquo;s an intimate sort of speaking mannerism in this context. It&rsquo;s kinda like how I address myself as daddy to my sons.]<br>&ldquo;Promise?&rdquo; Chu Feng was confused.<br>&ldquo;Although this place is unable to confine father, father still wishes for the Chu Heavenly Clan to personally release me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Only you are able to help father. You must obtain the acknowledgement of the Chu Heavenly Clan. Only by obtaining their acknowledgement will they release father.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;At that time, father will tell you everything about your mother,&rdquo; Chu Xuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;I will. I will accomplish it,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded his head repeatedly.<br>Chu Feng was not only anxious to know about his mother, but he also did not wish for his father to continue to be imprisoned in a forbidden area.<br>&ldquo;Father will wait for that day,&rdquo; with a smile on his face, Chu Xuanyuan stroked Chu Feng&rsquo;s head again.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng, whose eyes were originally shining brightly, immediately felt sleepy all of a sudden. Soon, his eyes closed, and he fell asleep.<br>After Chu Feng fell asleep, Chu Xuanyuan stood up. With a wave of his sleeve, the surrounding illusion was dissipated. The surrounding scenery returned to how it was before.<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re reluctant to part with him, you can actually bring him with you,&rdquo; Old Ape urged again.<br>He was able to tell from Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s behavior that he was worried about Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; However, Chu Xuanyuan was determined. After he finished saying those words, he walked into the sky. Although he walked with a slow pace, he disappeared into the sky in the blink of an eye.<br>Old Ape sighed and shook his head. Then, he took a profound glance at Chu Feng before following after Chu Xuanyuan.<br>After Chu Xuanyuan and Old Ape left, that region became particularly desolate.<br>Chu Feng continued to lay on the ground for a very long time before he opened his eyes again.<br><br></p></div>
