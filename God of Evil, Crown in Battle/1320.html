        <h1>Chapter 1320</h1>
        <div> - True Strength<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;You bastard.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that their fellow disciple was being humiliated by Chu Feng in such a manner, the disciples of the Colorful Bamboo Forest were all enraged. Several hundred of them charged toward Chu Feng with deep killing intent.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like it. Didn&rsquo;t I say to attack together earlier? Else, you&rsquo;ll be wasting my time,&rdquo; Faced with the several hundred figures that were charging toward him, not only was Chu Feng not afraid, a smile even emerged on his face.<br>That smile was expressing a hidden meaning that they were doing what he desired them to do.<br>&ldquo;Woosh.&rdquo; Suddenly, a flash of light shone through Chu Feng&rsquo;s foot. Like an arrow being shot explosively out from a bow, Chu Feng charged toward the army of Colorful Bamboo Forest disciples.<br>&ldquo;Wuuwaa~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eeaahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>In an instant, blood began to swirl in the air, and unceasing screams filled the region. There was simply no one who could contend against Chu Feng. In a blink of an eye, fifty-three of the Colorful Bamboo Forest disciples fell from the sky with serious injuries. They had lost all strength to continue fighting.<br>Seeing this, the Colorful Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s disciple that had led the army of over a thousand ordered, &ldquo;Attack together, cripple this bastard!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Kill~~~~~~~~~&rdquo;<br>The disciples of the Colorful Bamboo Forest did not hesitate. One by one, they took out their Royal Armaments and joined the fray, surrounding Chu Feng and attacking him.<br>In an instant, Chu Feng was besieged by over a thousand Martial Kings. Furthermore, they were not blindly attacking him. Instead, they were orderly attacking and defending in a large formation.<br>These thousand plus Martial Kings each held a Royal Armament. A battle formation formed by these Martial Kings was definitely no small matter.<br>Black clouds began to roll. Waves of wind and lightning began to appear as the sky darkened. In this world of darkness, the only things that could be seen were the numerous martial skills and blade rays wreaking havoc.<br>However, even with this being the case, Chu Feng was not at all at a disadvantage.<br>Like a god of war, using empty hands and empty fists, Chu Feng shuffled within the army of thousands. Not only were his opponents unable to harm in in the slightest, all of those that were targeted by him were unable to escape his pursuit.<br>At this time, screams filled the sky and blood sprinkled down like rain.<br>However, not a single one of those miserable screams was Chu Feng&rsquo;s, and not a single drop of the blood was Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>Those who were injured were only the disciples of the Colorful Bamboo Forest.<br>Even though they had gathered over a thousand people and set up a grand formation, they were still no match for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Are you truly the disciples of the Colorful Bamboo Forest, the core disciples of the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest? It seems that you all are merely at this level,&rdquo; Chu Feng felt bored and began to insult them.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you are forcing me to do this. Since you dare to act this arrogantly, I shall allow you to experience our true strength.&rdquo; That disciple who led the crowd shouted explosively. After that, his clothes began to flutter in the wind and his battle power actually began to rise.<br>Most importantly, his pair of eyes turned hollow as a ruthless bestial aura began to emerge from him.<br>&ldquo;Aooouuu~~~~~~&rdquo;<br>At the same time, many others among the Colorful Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s disciples with cultivations at rank five Martial King began to emit the same sort of change as that rank six Martial King.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? How come their auras have suddenly become this ferocious?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that they have learned a special mysterious technique?&rdquo;<br>The changes from the Colorful Bamboo Forest disciples stunned even the numerous disciples that were watching the fight. However, while they were stunned, they were also amazed by it.<br>&ldquo;Oh, so you all have hidden forbidden medicine in your mouths to stealthily use when the situation turns bad.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For the sake of handling me, you all have truly racked your brains for schemes. However, I must tell you all, the power obtained from taking forbidden medicines cannot be considered to be your own strength,&rdquo; At this time, Chu Feng spoke. He had already seen through the methods of the Colorful Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s disciples.<br>&ldquo;For real? Did they really hide forbidden medicine in their mouths?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, that seems to be the case. Look at their appearances, isn&rsquo;t that the appearance one would have after taking the Bestial Pellet forbidden medicine?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In order to defeat Chu Feng, these thousand plus grand and elite disciples from the Colorful Bamboo Forest actually took forbidden medicines. Isn&rsquo;t this a bit too despicable?&rdquo;<br>After hearing what Chu Feng said, many disciples suddenly realized what had happened too. In an instant, sighs of disappointment were being heard from the crowd continuously. Everyone felt that the disciples of the Colorful Bamboo Forest were truly too despicable, too shameless.<br>&ldquo;Enough of your bullshit, your life is mine!&rdquo; Seeing that their actions were exposed, the disciples of the Colorful Bamboo Forest were even more enraged. One by one, they began to launch fatal attacks at Chu Feng.<br>What they were doing could not be considered to simply be a fight; they were actually trying to take Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.<br>&ldquo;A bunch of ignorant yet arrogant trash.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, I shall let you all know what true strength really is.&rdquo;<br>Faced with the numerous fatal attacks coming at him from all directions, Chu Feng smiled coldly.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes flickered, and his long hair began to dance in the wind. As his gown fluttered, a boundless aura began to revolve around him like a hurricane.<br>&ldquo;Huuu~~~&rdquo;<br>That aura was extremely powerful and capable of sweeping everything before its path, conquering all obstacles. Not only did that aura completely shatter all of the incoming fatal attacks, it even blew away the thousand plus disciples of the Colorful Bamboo Forest. Not a single one of them was capable of withstanding its might.<br>Not only did each and every one of them roll around and scream repeatedly in midair, they were even unable to continue to hold onto the Royal Armaments in their hands. Losing all ability to fight the hurricane, they, along with their weapons, ended up crashing onto the ground.<br>Even though he was against a thousand, Chu Feng possessed the overwhelming advantage and obtained victory.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, he&rsquo;s actually a rank five Martial King.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As a rank three Martial King, he was already able to fight against rank six Martial Kings. In that case, as a rank five Martial King, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that even rank eight Martial Kings would not be a match for him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is truly too frightening. With how young he is, how is he this powerful?&rdquo;<br>At this moment, voices of shock filled the region. That was because Chu Feng was no longer hiding his cultivation and had revealed his true cultivation of a rank five Martial King.<br>&ldquo;Damn it, this bastard was actually hiding his cultivation&rdquo;<br>The disciples from the Colorful Bamboo Forest who had fallen to the ground were extremely angry. Only now did they realize that Chu Feng was pretending to be a hog so he could eat tigers, and they had all fallen into his trap.<br>&ldquo;Wuuuwaa~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, a boundlessly oppressive might came crashing down on the Colorful Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s disciples who had fallen to the ground. Like dying dogs, each and every one of them was suppressed deep into the ground.<br>Following that frightening oppressive might, a figure confidently and casually float down from the sky. As for that person, it was naturally Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What are you planning to do? Victory and defeat have already been determined. Why aren&rsquo;t you stopping your attacks? Can it be that you want to kill us?&rdquo;<br>The disciples from the Colorful Bamboo Forest were extremely frightened. They were able to sense how frightening Chu Feng&rsquo;s oppressive might was, and how it felt like they could be crushed to death by it at any moment.<br>&ldquo;Since victory and defeat have been determined, then you all should comply with the bet we made before the fight and use your mouths to pick up feces.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet, earlier, you all were trying to leave. What was that all about?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Bastard, we are grand disciples from the Colorful Bamboo Forest, how could we possibly allow a mere Discarded Bamboo Forest&rsquo;s disciple like you order us around?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Release us right now. According to status, we are greatly superior to you. Don&rsquo;t you act so impudent toward us. Let us go right away.&rdquo; The disciples of the Colorful Bamboo Forest were extremely prideful and arrogant. Thus, how could they possibly allow themselves to eat feces before all these people? Therefore, without the slightest hesitation, they refused Chu Feng&rsquo;s demand.<br>&ldquo;It would seem that you all are not planning to acknowledge your promises? With all these people present, are you really shameless enough to go back on your word?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked mockingly.<br>&ldquo;Enough of your bullshit, release us right now. Else, the elders from our Colorful Bamboo Forest will not let you get away with it,&rdquo; That disciple who led the others actually began to threaten Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Do you all know what sort of ending those people who have challenged me, Chu Feng, but refused to comply with the bet after losing received?&rdquo; Chu Feng ignored those Colorful Bamboo Forest disciples. Instead, he raised one hand and formed a dagger with his martial power. Then, he began to walk toward the leading disciple.<br>&ldquo;...&rdquo; At this moment, the entire place grew quiet. No one replied to Chu Feng&rsquo;s question. However, they all knew that Chu Feng might do something astonishing.<br>Finally, Chu Feng arrived before that leading disciple and couched down. Then, he placed the dagger in his hand on that disciple&rsquo;s mouth. With a smile on his face, he asked, &ldquo;Do you know?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What are you planning to do? You must not try to mess around with me, else&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ahhhh~~~~~&rdquo;<br>Before that disciple could finish what he wanted to say, the dagger in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand turned into a flash of light and ruthlessly sliced off that disciple&rsquo;s mouth and chin.<br>&ldquo;Since your words are inferior to even farts, why bother having a mouth?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br></p></div>
