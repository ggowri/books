        <div> - That Man<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, you have not come here purely to bid in the auction right? You have come here to auction something as well, no?" The Ghost Sect Hall's Hall Master said.<br>"Of course," as Chu Feng spoke, he took out the inheritance secret skill.<br>In addition to that inheritance secret skill, Chu Feng also took out many other items to auction.<br>These items were practically all obtained from Exalted Archer's Tomb. Some were bizarre and seemed to be of value. However, those items were not of much use to Chu Feng.<br>Since keeping them would be useless, Chu Feng decided to auction a portion of them. Perhaps he might be able to auction them for a good price.<br>After that, the Ghost Sect Hall's Hall Master continued to chat with Chu Feng for a while. Then, Chu Feng took his leave.<br>After all, he had finished his important tasks. Chu Feng could not keep Elder Xingyi and Xia Yun'er waiting for him. After all, they had accompanied him here.<br>That said, after Chu Feng left, Old Man Gui Chou asked with a worried frown, "Lord Hall Master, while it was true that little friend Chu Feng's Immortal Armaments are top quality Immortal Armaments of considerable value, they would only be able to be auctioned for about five hundred thousand Immortal Martial Stones at most. How could you purchase them at a price of six hundred thousand Immortal Martial Stones each?"<br>"How is one to rope in someone and befriend them without investing a bit?"<br>"Not to mention losing a mere three million Immortal Martial Stones, if we can befriend Chu Feng, I am willing to invest even thirty million Immortal Martial Stones," the Ghost Sect Hall's Hall Master said.<br>"Lord Hall Master, you really think that Chu Feng to be Chu Xuanyuan's son?" Old Man Gui Chou asked.<br>Old Man Gui Chou knew that there was a reason why their Lord Hall Master thought so highly of Chu Feng.<br>The main reason for that was because their Lord Hall Master felt that Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan's son.<br>However, no one could be certain that Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan's son. However, to expend such a vast amount of wealth to entice Chu Feng in this sort of situation seemed like the gains would not make up for the losses.<br>"His name is the same. He has also trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. Even his appearance resembles Chu Xuanyuan so much. There's no mistake, he is definitely Chu Xuanyuan's son."<br>Faced with Old Man Gui Chou's question, the Ghost Sect Hall's Hall Master replied in a very certain manner.<br>"But, according to the rumors, Chu Xuanyuan's son already died. Furthermore, Chu Feng has never admitted that he is from the Chu Heavenly Clan. He has also never mentioned that he is Chu Xuanyuan's son," Old Man Gui Chou was still skeptical.<br>When Chu Feng first came to fame, countless people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm felt that Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan's son. Merely, many people had gradually rejected that guess.<br>Their rejection of that guess was not without basis. After all, there had been rumors stating that Chu Xuanyuan's son had died.<br>"The people of the world still do not know Chu Xuanyuan well enough. How could his son possibly die?"<br>The Ghost Sect Hall's Hall Master shook his head with a smile on his face.<br>His smile seemed to be sneering at the crowd for being foolish.<br>"Lord Hall Master, if Chu Feng really is Chu Xuanyuan's son, why didn't Chu Xuanyuan show himself? Furthermore, why would he agree to be punished and imprisoned by the Chu Heavenly Clan? Exactly what is going on here?" Old Man Gui Chou was extremely confused.<br>Many people felt that, back then, Chu Xuanyuan most definitely possessed strength surpassing that of the entire Chu Heavenly Clan. However, Chu Xuanyuan had decided to surrender to the Chu Heavenly Clan's punishment.<br>This caused a lot of people to be confused. It also gave birth to a lot of rumors.<br>The majority of the rumors stated that Chu Xuanyuan had grown weaker, and was unable to contend against the Chu Heavenly Clan. That was the reason why he surrendered and accepted his punishment.<br>However, there were also people that felt that Chu Xuanyuan had something else in mind. For example, this was what the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master felt. Old Man Gui Chou also felt this way.<br>&ldquo;Likely, not even the heavens know what a man like him is thinking,&rdquo; the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master sighed.<br>Suddenly, the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master said, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. A lot of people have come to our Ghost Sect Hall to participate in the Grand Auction Assembly. There are also many rude and unreasonable individuals among them. You must guarantee Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety. At the very least, nothing can be allowed to happen to Chu Feng in the Ghost Sect Hall, understand?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Hall Master, please rest assured. This subordinate has already arranged things. No one will be able to harm Chu Feng in our Ghost Sect Hall,&rdquo; Old Man Gui Chou said.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng had returned to Elder Xingyi and Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s still time left before the Grand Auction Assembly begins. We should go and have some fun at the Stone Gambling Hall,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;Stone Gambling Hall? What sort of place is that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;You know about Immortal Martial Stones, right? However, do you know how Immortal Martial Stones are extracted?&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er asked.<br>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>&ldquo;It is extremely difficult to extract Immortal Martial Stones. The reason for that is because the Immortal Martial Stones are located alongside Black Crystal Stones. Not only are the Black Crystal Stones exceptionally hard, but their numbers are also much greater than Immortal Martial Stones. Immortal Martial Stones will generally be surrounded by Black Crystal Stones.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the Black Crystal Stones, in addition to their toughness, they are also capable of obstructing all observation techniques. As such, the observation techniques that world spiritists possess are simply ineffective against them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of this, a game originated. It is called Stone Gambling.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This so-called Stone Gambling is to sell ores that contain both Immortal Martial Stones and Black Crystal Stones. Based on the sizes of the ores, their prices will differ too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why it is called Stone Gambling is because it might be possible for one to open up a piece of ore the size of a small hill, only to find that it is composed solely of Black Crystal Stones without a single Immortal Martial Stone.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, it is also possible for one to open up a watermelon-sized ore to find out that it is filled with Immortal Martial Stones, and that the Black Crystal Stones make up only the exterior surface.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is precisely because this is gambling with luck that this sort of game became known as Stone Gambling.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have previously disguised my identity and secretly come here to play this game before. It is extremely interesting. Unfortunately, my luck was not so good, and I ended up losing quite miserably,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said with a beaming smile on her face.<br>Upon seeing the innocent child-like smile on Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face, Chu Feng started feeling a sense of obligation.<br>He felt as if if he didn&rsquo;t go and accompany her to the Stone Gambling Hall, he would have let her down.<br>How could one let down a beauty like Xia Yun&rsquo;er?<br>&ldquo;Very well, let us go and have a stroll around the Stone Gambling Hall,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Good, good, good,&rdquo; Xia Yun&rsquo;er said good three times in succession. It could be seen that she was extremely interested in the Stone Gambling Hall.<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng, Xia Yun&rsquo;er and Elder Xingyi proceeded toward the so-called Stone Gambling Hall.<br><br><br></p></div>
