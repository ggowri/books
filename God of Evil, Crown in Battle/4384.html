        <h1>Chapter 4383</h1>
        <div>: Yu Sha&rsquo;s Heart<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Weng!<br>But all of a sudden, a gentle surge of energy wrapped itself around Chu Feng, protecting him from the lava.<br>It was spirit power. Someone had channeled his spirit power around him.<br>Following that, the spirit power forcefully fished Chu Feng out from the formation.<br>Taking a closer look, it was Liu Shangwu.<br>&ldquo;This brother over there, how are you doing? Take this pill. I&rsquo;ll alleviate your burns.&rdquo;<br>After pulling Chu Feng out from the formation, Liu Shangwu quickly walked up to him, treated him with a formation, and even offered him a pill.<br>Initially, Chu Feng was feeling extremely frustrated.<br>While the formation had indeed brought him some pain, in truth, his body had started to sink downward. As long as he could get to the very bottom of that lava pool, he would have cleared the trial, and the treasure would have been his.<br>Yet, Liu Shangwu interrupted him in the midst of it, which meant that he would have to start anew later on.<br>Even though the person who pulled him out was trying to help him, he was just getting in his way.<br>But somehow, when Chu Feng saw that it was Liu Shangwu, he quickly suppressed his fury. He did have quite a good impression of the latter after the latter helped him earlier on.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;<br>Instead of accepting Liu Shangwu&rsquo;s pill, Chu Feng began circulating his spirit power to recuperate from his injuries.<br>With Liu Shangwu&rsquo;s help, it didn&rsquo;t take long for him to make a full recovery. After all, the formation served only to inflict pain and not endanger one, so most of the wounds were superficial.<br>&ldquo;Holy heavens! Your spirit power&hellip; This brother over here, you have also grasped rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation too?&rdquo;<br>Liu Shangwu stared at Chu Feng in astonishment, not expecting the latter to possess such powerful spirit power.<br>&ldquo;Not yet. I&rsquo;m still at rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation at the moment,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;This brother over here, you really like to joke around. How can someone who&rsquo;s at rank two Dragon Transformation Sensation possess such great power?&rdquo;<br>Liu Shangwu replied with a shake of his head, thinking that Chu Feng was joking with him.<br>After all, the spirit power Chu Feng possessed was actually on par with his.<br>Regarding this matter, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t bother to explain too much. Instead, he clasped his fist and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Chu Feng. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you, Brother Liu.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt that it was worth befriending Liu Shangwu.<br>The latter might have a rugged appearance, but beneath that lay a warm heart.<br>It might be by way of convenience that Liu Shangwu chose to &lsquo;save him&rsquo; from the lava formation, but the pill the other party had given him was definitely worth quite a sum.<br>Given that they were strangers who had met a moment earlier, Liu Shangwu was indeed a very generous person to be willing to offer a helping hand to him.<br>There weren&rsquo;t many people of Liu Shangwu&rsquo;s character in this world of cultivation.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Liu Shangwu. It&rsquo;s also a pleasure to meet you, Brother Chu,&rdquo; Liu Shangwu formally clasped his fist and introduced himself.<br>After that, Liu Shangwu began telling Chu Feng about what kind of dangers there were in the Death Dominion, and what he had to look out for. He unreservedly shared all of his experiences with Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng was a little moved by this gesture. They were clearly opponents, and yet, the other party was still willing to go this far to help him. This further improved Chu Feng&rsquo;s impression of him.<br>Under such circumstances, Chu Feng also chose not to hide the truth from Liu Shangwu either. He began telling the latter about the secret within the lava formation so that the latter would know that he had intentionally jumped into the formation earlier, and there was actually no need to worry.<br>After hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s side of the story, Liu Shangwu was visibly shocked. He quickly walked to the side of the formation to observe it close-up, and soon enough, his eyes widened in astonishment.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, you really have sharp eyes! Even with the appearance of this formation, I still have to spend quite a bit of effort to see the treasure hidden inside. Yet, you were able to notice it before the formation even noticed&hellip; It looks like your mastery of world spiritist techniques is above mine!<br>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, you are still a junior, right? It looks like there are a lot of talented individuals amongst the younger generations!&rdquo; Liu Shangwu remarked in awe as he began reassessing Chu Feng once more.<br>Despite displaying his admiration toward Chu Feng, there was no hint of envy or jealousy in his eyes at all.<br>&lsquo;Brother Liu, you&rsquo;re flattering me. I was just lucky. Besides, having a sharp eye of discernment is just one of the qualities of a world spiritist. It doesn&rsquo;t fully represent his capabilities,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu, you are too humble&hellip; The ability to discern is the most important quality of a world spiritist! Initially, I was still worried about Brother Chu&rsquo;s safety, but it looks like I was worrying needlessly. Brother Chu, if I&rsquo;m lucky enough to defeat Zhao Xuanhe, there&rsquo;ll be a chance for us to cross hands,&rdquo; Liu Shangwu said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Liu, is Zhao Xuanhe a formidable world spiritist? I heard others saying that he would be the champion of the world spiritist tournament, but I held some skepticism toward those remarks. I didn&rsquo;t think that you would share the same evaluation as them,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>To be honest, Chu Feng was rather curious about what kind of person Zhao Xuanhe was too.<br>Given that the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster was willing to put in so much effort to cultivate the treasure just to help Zhao Xuanhe, it could only mean that Zhao Xuanhe meant a lot to him.<br>Perhaps, his standing might even be greater than that of the Supreme Elders.<br>&ldquo;Zhao Xuanhe is the First Personal Disciple of the Soaring Flower Gazebo&rsquo;s sectmaster. That being said, he isn&rsquo;t very old, roughly around his two hundreds at the moment. He&rsquo;s an incredibly talented individual, having achieved great accomplishments in both his cultivation and as a world spiritist despite his young age.<br>&ldquo;Based on what I know, he has grasped the rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation, just like you and me. As for his cultivation, he has reached rank eight Utmost Exalted level. It&rsquo;s just that&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Speaking up to this point, Liu Shangwu seemed to hesitate a little.<br>&ldquo;Brother Liu, is it inconvenient for you to talk about this matter?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing&hellip;&rdquo; Liu Shangwu chuckled softly before waving his hand. &ldquo;Brother Chu, I&rsquo;ll be moving on first. See you on the dueling ring!&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Liu Shangwu clasped his fist toward Chu Feng and left the area.<br>Chu Feng watched Liu Shangwu&rsquo;s departing figure with a contemplative look on his face.<br>His instincts told him that there was an unusual relationship between Liu Shangwu and Zhao Xuanhe, and it seemed likely that they weren&rsquo;t on very good terms with one another.<br>In any case, after Liu Shangwu left, Chu Feng prepared himself to leap into the formation once more.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment!&rdquo;<br>It was at this moment that Yu Sha&rsquo;s voice suddenly sounded once more, but this time, her tone seemed to carry some conflicted emotions.<br>Initially, she didn&rsquo;t understand why Chu Feng had to leap into the formation, but after hearing the conversation between Chu Feng and Liu Shangwu, she finally understood it.<br>He was doing it for her.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? You can&rsquo;t bear to see me in pain?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a chuckle.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need such a cultivation resource, and there&rsquo;s no need for you to go through such pain either,&rdquo; Yu Sha replied.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misunderstand. I&rsquo;m doing this because I want to. I&rsquo;m not expecting you to feel grateful for me or anything. It&rsquo;s my choice whether I want to do it or not, so there&rsquo;s no need for you to feel pressured because of this.&rdquo;<br>After saying this piece, Chu Feng leaped into the formation once again.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing how Chu Feng was so insistent on the matter, Yu Sha found herself at a loss of words.<br>She watched as Chu Feng sunk deeper and deeper into the formation, and the tightening frown on his face seemed to show that the pain he was feeling was growing more and more intense.<br>However, his shouts were obviously much softer than before.<br>Yu Sha could tell that he was intentionally suppressing himself so that she wouldn&rsquo;t worry&hellip;<br></p></div>
