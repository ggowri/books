        <div> - Insulting Chu Feng<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master, our Sacred Pellet Villa have lived peacefully with your Yuwen City for many years.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I do not wish for such a thing to reoccur,&rdquo; The Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said to the Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master after receiving those hundred Immortal Armaments.<br>He was threatening the Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master. He was telling him that if it should happen again, it would definitely not end in a peaceful settlement.<br>&ldquo;Lord Villa Master, how could I possibly dare to do such a thing a second time? After all, if I have to continue to compensate you, likely all of my Yuwen City&rsquo;s treasures will be lost by me,&rdquo; The Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master said with a wry smile.<br>Seeing his painful expression, it could be seen that compensating him with a hundred Immortal Armaments was indeed akin to cutting his flesh. It was truly a large sum of wealth and power he had lost.<br>&ldquo;Haha, since that&rsquo;s the case, I will take my leave now,&rdquo; The Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master laughed out loud. Then, he prepared to leave.<br>He had the appearance of settling the grievances between them with laughter.<br>Suddenly, the Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master asked, &ldquo;Lord Villa Master, what is the relationship between you and that Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only met little friend Chu Feng today. What sort of relationship do you think we have?&rdquo; The Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart tightened. He faintly sensed that the situation was bad from the conversation between the two.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master waved his sleeve, and a total of fifty Immortal Armaments flew out of his Cosmos Sack and arrived before him. They started to float toward the Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master.<br>&ldquo;Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master, what is the meaning of this?&rdquo; The Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master asked.<br>&ldquo;Lord Villa Master, you know about the grievances and grudges between that Chu Feng and I. Sooner or later, I will have to eliminate that Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And now, since he is before me, I have no reason to let him go. I hope that Lord Villa Master will present me the opportunity to avenge my son,&rdquo; After the Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master finished saying those words, he clasped his fist and bent his back respectfully.<br>Witnessing this scene, the frown on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face grew even tighter. What he did not wish for the most had occurred.<br>It was not only Chu Feng whose expression changed. The expression of many elders from the Sacred Pellet Villa had also changed.<br>Fifty Immortal Armaments in exchange for the Sacred Pellet Villa to not get involved in the matter. This transaction could be said to be extremely profitable.<br>That said, compared to the great majority of the elders, Ma Changchun had a panicky expression on his face.<br>It could be seen that he was very afraid, afraid that their Lord Villa Master would really accept this deal.<br>If that was to be done, it would be equivalent to pushing Chu Feng to his death.<br>Furthermore, it was Ma Changchun who had invited Chu Feng. If Chu Feng were to really die, it would be equivalent to him causing Chu Feng&rsquo;s death. His conscience was unable to take that.<br>That being said, compared to the flustered and panicky expression that Ma Changchun had, Chu Feng was rather calm and collected.<br>Chu Feng held the Evil God Sword in his hand tighter. Layer upon layer of power began to flow into the Evil God Sword.<br>The others did not notice it. However, the Evil God Sword was already changing slightly.<br>That seemingly unremarkable Incomplete Immortal Armament was a sort of unimaginably evil and powerful power slowly and quietly awakening.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, that Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master burst into loud laughter. Then, he waved his sleeve, and a &lsquo;rattle&rsquo; was heard as the fifty Immortal Armaments were brought together to one place.<br>Then, a &lsquo;clank&rsquo; was heard as the fifty Immortal Armaments were shot back toward the Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master.<br>&ldquo;Although I&rsquo;ve only met little friend Chu Feng today, little friend Chu Feng is our Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s distinguished guest. If you plan to attack him, I will absolutely not sit and watch indifferently. Not to mention a mere fifty Immortal Armaments, even if you are to present me with five hundred Immortal Armaments, you will still not be able to change my mind.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, allow me to be frank, even though what little friend Chu Feng did was slightly excessive, it was still Yuwen Tingyi and Yuwen Hualong who were in the wrong first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are justifications for everything. In my opinion, the grudges between them, members of the younger generation, have already been settled. As a senior, you should not look further into this matter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, if you looked further into this matter properly, you would, at the very most, be able to obtain revenge.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if you fail to do it properly, your entire family might be exterminated. That sort of thing is not uncommon in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are people beyond the person, mountains surpassing the mountain and heavens above the heavens.&rdquo;<br>After he finished saying those words, the Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master soared into the sky.<br>He said those words to warn the Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master that Chu Feng&rsquo;s background was no small matter, and extremely unfathomable. With the power and strength that their Yuwen City possessed, if they wanted to kill Chu Feng, they should first consider things properly.<br>&ldquo;My, Yuwen Yanhong&rsquo;s, son is someone that not even the Heavenly Emperor can touch!&rdquo;<br>The Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master let out a loud shout. That shout of his was aimed at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you wish to avenge those brats?! If you have the ability, then come at me yourself! What sort of ability is it to borrow the strength of another?!&rdquo;<br>The Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master continued to shout at Chu Feng.<br>He was actually ridiculing and taunting Chu Feng.<br>He was ridiculing Chu Feng for borrowing the strength of the Sacred Pellet Villa to obtain revenge, only to fail in doing so in the end.<br>He was flaunting his strength and mocking how powerless Chu Feng was.<br>&ldquo;Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master, I&rsquo;ve said this already. Little friend Chu Feng is our Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s distinguished guest.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you continue to speak so rudely, do not blame me for becoming impolite,&rdquo; The Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master spoke coldly.<br>Onec the Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said those words, the Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master actually ended up shutting his mouth. Merely, he was still looking at Chu Feng with a gaze filled with murderous desire.<br>Faced with the murderous-looking Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master, Chu Feng smiled lightly.<br>He said, &ldquo;Yuwen CIty&rsquo;s City Master, it is true that I, Chu Feng, will not be able to kill you with the strength that I currently possess.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I&rsquo;m afraid that you will not be able to protect the lives of your son and Yuwen Hualong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Just you wait. I will have you regret what you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; The Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master laughed coldly. Then, he said, &ldquo;I wish to see how you&rsquo;re going to make me regret.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng stopped bothering to continue talking with the Yuwen City&rsquo;s City Master. He turned around and indicated to the Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master that they could leave now.<br>Thus, the Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master led the Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s army and left this place.<br>Although they&rsquo;d failed in avenging Li Xiang and the other dead disciples on this trip, they had managed to obtain an enormous harvest.<br>To them, they&rsquo;d managed to make a great profit this time around. In fact, it could even be said that Li Xiang and the others&rsquo; deaths had been worthwhile.<br>After all, to them, unless the disciples that died had been nurtured as their future successors...<br>&hellip; not to mention a single disciple&rsquo;s life, even if it was ten disciples or a hundred disciples, they would not necessarily be as valuable as a single Immortal Armament.<br>After experiencing what had happened, Chu Feng managed to see the true colors of the Sacred Pellet Villa.<br>Even though they were indeed a famous and upright power, they would still place their greatest importance on their own interest.<br>If Chu Feng wanted revenge, he could not rely on them. Instead, he must rely on himself.<br>&ldquo;Lord VIlla Master, elders, I thank the Sacred Pellet Villa for your reception of me. Unfortunately, this Chu Feng has something that he must do, and will not be able to journey together with you all. I will take my leave here,&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly said to the Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master.<br><br><br></p></div>
