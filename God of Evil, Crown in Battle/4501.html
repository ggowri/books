        <h1>Chapter 4500</h1>
        <div>: Is This How You Repay Me?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Not bad. You made this?&rdquo; Chu Feng turned to Song Yun and asked.<br>&ldquo;Yeah! I specially made this to thank big brother Chu Feng. You should hurry up and drink it! It won&rsquo;t taste nice when it&rsquo;s no longer hot!&rdquo; Song Yun urged with her hand.<br>She reached out and pushed the gourd toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s mouth.<br>On the other hand, Chu Feng chuckled and said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that you would have such outstanding cooking skills.&rdquo;<br>He picked up the gourd filled with chicken soup and gulped it down in a single mouthful.<br>&ldquo;Not bad. The flavor is marvelous,&rdquo; Chu Feng said in satisfaction as he wiped his mouth.<br>But all of a sudden, the smile on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face stiffened up lividly.<br>He crushed the gourd in his hand before he glared at Song Yun and bellowed furiously, &ldquo;You put poison in the soup?&rdquo;<br>He could feel a surge of power shrouding over his soul, sealing off his cultivation and spirit power. He was slowly losing his ability to tap into his strength as a cultivator and spirit formations.<br>And the culprit behind it all was the chicken soup that Song Yun just fed him.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, please don&rsquo;t get angry. I&rsquo;ll never do anything that would harm you! The thing I just fed you is not just any poison. I swear that it&rsquo;s beneficial to you!&rdquo; Song Yun exclaimed.<br>&ldquo;A poison that&rsquo;s beneficial to me? Heh! This is the first time in my life I have heard of something that miraculous! I helped you out of kindness; why did you scheme against me?&rdquo; Chu Feng roared furiously.<br>As he spoke, he reached out to grab Song Yun&rsquo;s collar.<br>It was just that his cultivation had already plummeted down to mid Exalted level by now, making him no longer a match for the<br>Exalted level Song Yun.<br>But surprisingly, Song Yun actually didn&rsquo;t dodge Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack. She allowed Chu Feng to grab her collar without resisting.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, I really haven&rsquo;t lied to you! This is indeed poison, but it&rsquo;s the Conquerstar Soul Poison! Your cultivation will indeed be temporarily sealed after drinking it down, but you&rsquo;ll swiftly regain it once it fuses with your soul!<br>&ldquo;On top of that, if you were to find the antidote to the Conquerstar Soul Poison, the two energies will amalgamate with one another to create an astonishing amount of natural energies. This bundle of natural energies contains incredibly formidable martial comprehension.<br>&ldquo;If you could make use of this opportunity, your cultivation will grow tremendously, allowing you to make a breakthrough!<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I won&rsquo;t lie to you. I&rsquo;ll prove it to you once we enter the forbidden cultivation ground!&rdquo; Song Yun said.<br>&ldquo;You mentioned the antidote. Where is it?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s face remained livid, but he had calmed down a little. He released his grip on Song Yun for the time being.<br>His gut instincts told him that this lass wasn&rsquo;t deceiving him. He could still feel no hostility coming from her, which was the reason why he trusted her in the first place. Nevertheless, he was still infuriated by Song Yun&rsquo;s actions.<br>&ldquo;The antidote is inside the Conquerstar Mountain Villa, in the middle of the forbidden cultivation ground. To be honest with you, I&rsquo;m here not to capture the burglars but to make use of the Conquerstar Soul Poison and the antidote inside the forbidden cultivation ground to raise my cultivation.<br>&ldquo;My sister was the one who gave me to Conquerstar Soul Poison, but with my cultivation, I can only afford to consume a portion of it. Otherwise, my body will be unable to withstand the strain from the poison.<br>&ldquo;But big brother Chu Feng, I know that you&rsquo;ll be able to do it. You&rsquo;re at rank five Utmost Exalted level! So, I placed the remaining poison inside the chicken soup!&rdquo; Song Yun said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but exhale deeply. If Song Yun wasn&rsquo;t lying to him, it would mean that she had no malicious intent toward him.<br>It was just that he couldn&rsquo;t help but be concerned because a poison was still a poison.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the antidote like?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;There are two caverns inside the forbidden cultivation ground. One of them leads to the Divine Cavern, where the Conquerstar Immortal Grass lies. The other one leads to the Demon Cavern, where one can find the Conquerstar Demon Flower.<br>&ldquo;The Conquerstar Demon Flower is the antidote that we&rsquo;re looking for over here. As long as we consume it, it&rsquo;ll be able to produce the effect I spoke of,&rdquo; Song Yun said.<br>&ldquo;Is there a time limit? What&rsquo;ll happen if I don&rsquo;t&rsquo; consume the antidote in time?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, don&rsquo;t worry. I won&rsquo;t do anything that would harm you. Other than sealing off your cultivation temporarily, the Conquerstar Soul Poison is actually completely harmless. The poison will fade away by itself over time.<br>&ldquo;However, I guess you can say that there&rsquo;s a time limit too because the sooner you get to the antidote, the more natural energies you&rsquo;ll receive from the amalgamation,&rdquo; Song Yun replied.<br>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t lying to me, are you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a glint in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;I really am not! There&rsquo;s no reason for me to lie to you. You&rsquo;re my benefactor, I just want to repay you for helping me!&rdquo; Song Yun said with a wronged expression on his face.<br>On the other hand, Chu Feng sighed deeply.<br>This was the first time he was seeing someone &lsquo;repay&rsquo; him in such a manner.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, why did you not tell me the truth from the start? Why did you fool me into consuming the poison first?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, I know that you&rsquo;re an incredible person who boasts great knowledge in the world. I thought that you might know how valuable the Conquerstar Soul Poison is. To be honest with you, not even the Conquerstar Mountain Villa has any Conquerstar Soul Poison left anymore.<br>&ldquo;I thought that you wouldn&rsquo;t consume it once you know how valuable it is; that&rsquo;s why I withheld the truth from you,&rdquo; Song Yun said.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t respond to that.<br>There was actually some truth in what Song Yun said. If the Conquerstar Soul Poison was really as valuable as what Song Yun mentioned, he would be hesitant to take it from Song Yun.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trust you for now, but if I find that you have been lying to me, I won&rsquo;t let you go easily,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, you can put all your trust in me! If I really mean to harm you, I&rsquo;d have already done it by now since your cultivation is currently lower than mine!&rdquo; Song Yun replied.<br>Chu Feng was speechless toward that. His cultivation had plummeted all the way down to rank one Exalted level, and his spirit power had been sealed entirely, resulting in him being unable to exert any spirit power at all.<br>The current him was indeed completely helpless against the<br>Exalted level Song Yun.<br>Klang!<br>Klang!<br>Klang!<br>It was then that a series of deafening chimes echoed from above the plains.<br>Following that, a resounding voice began to speak.<br>&ldquo;Friends from far and wide, I&rsquo;m really thankful to you for being willing to make the long journey to my Conquerstar Mountain Villa and lend this old man a hand in apprehending those unforgivable burglars!&rdquo;<br>The abrupt announcement told Chu Feng and Song Yun that the test had finally come to an end, and that they should be able to enter the forbidden cultivation ground soon.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s rage had yet to disappear entirely, but he knew that it would be meaningless to dwell on this matter now. So, he began making his way out of the palace to take a look.<br>Indeed, the exit to the test had closed up. All of those who had cleared the test were currently standing at the entrances of their palaces.<br>There was a massive bell at the center of the square, and there was a group of people standing beside the bell.<br>These were the top experts of the Conquerstar Mountain Villa, and the one standing at the forefront of the group was a white-haired middle-aged man.<br>He was no other than the Villa Master.<br></p></div>
