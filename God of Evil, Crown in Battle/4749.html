        <div>: Challenging With My Life<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The closer he got, the more disciples there were. He began spotting disciples from the other three halls too.<br>Regardless of whether they were from the West Tiger Hall, South Vermilion Hall, or East Dragon Hall, they broke out in gossips as soon as they saw Chu Feng. He became the star of the show as soon as he arrived at the scene.<br>Chu Feng had just entered into the Hidden Dragon Martial, being the newest batch of newcomers. Yet, he actually managed to break Lord Dugu Lingtian&rsquo;s record and was evaluated to possess god aptitude. Besides that, the news that he joined the competition over Zi Ling and made a bet with Nangong Yuliu had also caused a huge commotion too.<br>His name was constantly on the tip of people&rsquo;s tonguesas everyone gossiped about him in intrigue.<br>But compared to the past, these disciples no longer just looked at him in disdain anymore. Instead, there was fear in their eyes.<br>They knew deep well that none of them was a match for Chu Feng, so they dared not compete themselves with him.<br>&ldquo;Senior Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Two familiar figures appeared from the East Dragon Hall. They were Hua Xu and Tu Yuanyuan.<br>&ldquo;Senior Chu Feng, did you really make a bet with Nangong Yuliu?&rdquo; Tu Yuanyuan asked, worried about Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.<br>&ldquo;Why are you so reckless?&rdquo; Tu Yuanyuan exclaimed nervously.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t trust me? Or do you think that I&rsquo;m unable to do it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I mean. It&rsquo;s just that I don&rsquo;t think it's wise for you to be putting such a high stake on something uncertain. Besides, I heard that Nangong Yuliu has quite a powerful background. Even if you win, it would only deepen the grudge between the two of you, bringing you endless trouble in the future. You should have properly thought things through before making a move here!&rdquo;<br>Tu Yuanyuan was so anxious that she was stomping her feet, but there was nothing she could do.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I know what I&rsquo;m doing,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>Seeing how assured Chu Feng was, Tu Yuanyuan was in no position to say anything. She could only hope for the best for him.<br>At the same time, a voice transmission was relayed into Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears. It was from Hua Xu.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ve already told my elder about the matter concerning Elder Ouyang Che. His punishment has already been sentenced, and it&rsquo;ll undermine the authority of my elder if he were to retract on his decision right now. So, it&rsquo;ll take a lengthy process to slowly bring Elder Ouyang Che back into the East Dragon Hall. But regardless, my elder has already promised me to get this matter done,&rdquo; Hua Xu said.<br>This was the matter which Chu Feng had tasked Hua Xu with, so he was glad to see how the latter was taking it seriously.<br>Soon, their group arrived at the outer perimeter of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake. There was a sect protector guarding the lake, and he was a black-haired old man with a scar on his face.<br>When the time was finally ripe, he opened the spirit formation gate and allowed the disciples into the midst of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake.<br>As Chu Feng approached the lake, he was finally able to get a complete look of the area. Beneath the six mountains that rose high into the sky, there were seven lakes. Six of these lakes were independent, located at the foot of each of the mountains, whereas the seven one was a convergence from those six lakes.<br>The water from the six lakes were constantly flowing toward the seventh lake at a fast pace, such that it was impossible to see it without paying close attention.<br>Beside the seventh lake, there was a stone monument erected that contained the word &lsquo;Forbidden&rsquo;. The same &lsquo;Forbidden&rsquo; word was also inscribed with spirit power above it as well.<br>This &lsquo;Forbidden&rsquo; word stretched like a humongous net, covering the entirety of the seventh formation. However, it seemed to only serve as a warning as it didn&rsquo;t seal off the lake.<br>This &lsquo;Forbidden&rsquo; word wasn&rsquo;t part of the formation that the sect founder constructed but was added later on by someone else.<br>&ldquo;Undergoing the tempering of the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake will awaken your energy, allowing you to fuse together as one with the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. You&rsquo;ll finally be able to experience the natural energies of the sect. As long as you can complete the tempering, it&rsquo;ll surely greatly aid you in your cultivation in the future.<br>&ldquo;However, you should know that it&rsquo;s possible to fail the tempering too, and you would have to wait another five years if that were to happen. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s unlikely that you&rsquo;ll fail as long as you accept the tempering normally. So, make sure to remain sharp, don&rsquo;t let your attention waver, and make sure not to bite off what you can&rsquo;t chew.&rdquo;<br>The protector guarding the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake began to impart the tempering method to Chu Feng at the others.<br>Due to the unique energy contained within the lake, they would have to put on a special dao robe before entering its midst. There was a formation inscribed on the dao robe which would further enhance the effects of the tempering if they were to use it in unison with a special method.<br>After the briefing by the sect protector, the disciples began orderly heading into the lake.<br>The protector had clearly mentioned that the energy in the seventh lake was too great for any for them to bear, and disallowed any disciples from heading there, so none of the disciples headed in that direction. Yet, Chu Feng walked straight up to it.<br>&ldquo;That disciple over there, what are you doing?&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing that Chu Feng was approaching the seventh lake, the protector immediately bellowed at him furiously.<br>His bellow swiftly caught the attention of all of the disciples, making Chu Feng the center of attention once more.<br>&ldquo;Lord Protector, I would like to try entering that lake,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Chu Feng, right? I&rsquo;m aware of your bet with Nangong Yuliu, and I know that you wish to break Lord Dugu Lingtian&rsquo;s record and change the name on the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake to yours. However, didn&rsquo;t you hear what I mentioned earlier? Do you know how dangerous the seventh lake is?<br>&ldquo;If you aren&rsquo;t able to control its power, you&rsquo;ll only end up swallowed by it. No one will be able to save you,&rdquo; the protector said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Protector, I&rsquo;m well aware of the risks. I&rsquo;ll accept whatever that comes out of my decision,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re a disciple of our Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, so I still want to give you some words of advice. The Blackwater Sixfinger Lake is different from the Snowy Heavenly Peak. Don&rsquo;t ruin your future over your vanity,&rdquo; the protector advised.<br>While it was clear that the protector did mean Chu Feng well, the scorn in his voice was rather apparent too. It was his responsibility as a protector to warn Chu Feng in advance, but he didn&rsquo;t have high expectations for the latter. In fact, he felt that Chu Feng was only entering the seventh formation for the sake of fulfilling his own vanity.<br>&ldquo;Lord Protector, I would still like to give it a try,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist and said.<br>He had already made up his mind, and no one would be able to change his decision anymore.<br>&ldquo;You may enter the seventh formation if you want to. I&rsquo;ve already said everything that ought to be said. I shan&rsquo;t stop you if you insist on entering, but I won&rsquo;t take responsibility for anything that happens to you.<br>&ldquo;However, Chu Feng, even if you can endure the power inside the lake, you only have an hour&rsquo;s time. If you aren&rsquo;t able to light up the formation within an hour, you won&rsquo;t be able to break Lord Dugu Lingtian&rsquo;s record. If so, I want you to get up right away, or else the water in the lake will start rampaging, and no one will be able to save you by then,&rdquo; the protector warned.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s impression of the protector changed a little upon hearing those words. He thought that the latter was simply underestimating him, but it seemed like he was earnestly doing his job here.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for your advice, Lord Protector.&rdquo;<br>Before the eyes of the crowd, Chu Feng clasped his fist and leaped straight into the seventh formation covered with the &lsquo;Forbidden&rsquo; word.<br></p></div>
