        <div> - Unknown Power<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;My dear Eggy, are you certain that this is an Asura God Stone?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m absolutely certain that it is an Asura God Stone. There&rsquo;s definitely no mistake,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen spoke with a determined expression.<br>&ldquo;But, according to you, it is simply impossible to move this Asura God Stone. How come I feel that I can control it then?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I also feel it to be very strange. Here, hand it to me, let me have a look,&rdquo; as Her Lady Queen spoke, she extended her little hand toward Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng did not hesitate, and directly handed the black stone in his hand to Her Lady Queen and placed it on her lily-white hand. After all, he felt that the stone was very ordinary.<br>However, when that piece of stone was placed in Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s hand, it was as if an enormous weight was placed onto her hand. Not only did Her Lady Queen fall to the ground, her hand also crashed to the ground.<br>Most importantly, when her hand smashed onto the ground, it even let out a loud sound. That simply did not resemble a delicate body falling to the ground. Instead, it was more like a enormous boulder of ten thousand catties smashing onto the ground.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, what happened?&rdquo; Seeing this scene, Chu Feng became extremely distressed. He immediately rushed forward to help Her Lady Queen back up.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that Asura God Stone. Quickly, take it away,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen pointed to the stone crushing her hand.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt astonished.<br>The reason for that was because there was clearly no weight to the stone when he was holding it. As such, how could it completely crush Her Lady Queen when it was handed to her?<br>Even though Chu Feng felt very puzzled, he still picked up the stone from Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s hand.<br>When Chu Feng picked up the stone, the stone felt extremely light, just like before.<br>However, when Chu Feng looked to Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s little hand that had been crushed by the stone, he immediately revealed an expression of shock and distress.<br>A bloody wound was present on Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s fair little hand. That wound was caused by her hand being crushed by the stone. As for that bloody wound , its shape was exactly the same as that of the stone.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was no longer able to maintain his calm.<br>This result meant that Her Lady Queen was not pretending, that the stone was truly capable of causing enormous harm to Her Lady Queen.<br>&ldquo;What is going on?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in alarm.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what this Queen wanted to ask you,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen Sat back up. Her eyes were perfectly round and fixed onto Chu Feng.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng lifted his hand and tossed the stone in his hand.<br>Chu Feng had tossed the stone very high. The stone even made a beautiful arc in midair.<br>When the stone was in midair, it did not appear to be peculiar at all. However, when it landed, not only did it let out an ear-piercing rumble, but Chu Feng was also able to feel the earth beneath his feet tremble violently.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Seeing this, the astonishment in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes grew even stronger.<br>What happened just then had verified how extraordinary that stone was.<br>Then, with a thought, that seemingly extremely heavy stone actually started floating again. It was actually being controlled by Chu Feng, and floated over to Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, how did you accomplish that?&rdquo; Seeing this, Her Lady Queen became even more surprised.<br>&ldquo;I merely used my oppressive might to move it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Merely your oppressive might?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s expression changed completely.<br>She naturally knew that martial cultivators were capable of accomplishing a lot of things through their oppressive might. Not only were they able to suppress their opponents, they were also capable of using their oppressive might as an attack to take their opponent&rsquo;s life.<br>As such, picking up something from afar using one&rsquo;s oppressive was simply child&rsquo;s play.<br>However, it would be one thing if what Chu Feng picked up using his oppressive might was something ordinary.<br>Instead, what Chu Feng picked up was an Asura God Stone, something deemed to be the strongest cultivation resource in the Asura Spirit World.<br>What countless experts from the Asura Spirit World were unable to accomplish was actually being done so effortlessly by Chu Feng. With this, how could Her Lady Queen not be astonished?<br>&ldquo;It really is just my oppressive might,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;How could you be this abnormal? You actually managed to so effortlessly control an Asura God Stone?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen looked to Chu Feng with an inconceivable expression.<br>She was certain what Chu Feng had managed to accomplish was not something that everyone was capable of doing.<br>There must be a reason why Chu Feng was capable of it. Merely, she did not know exactly what that reason was.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that this Asura God Stone is only suppressive toward you all?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>"That's absolutely not the case. If that were the case, your grandfather or your father would not have used a spirit formation to control it. There must be something special on you. Merely, I do not know what that is, and I am unable to sense it," Her Lady Queen said.<br>"Something special? There's no way for it to be that incredible, right?" Chu Feng laughed.<br>"I am not joking around. All that I've said is real," Her Lady Queen spoke with a serious expression.<br>"So I am actually that extraordinary?" Chu Feng spoke with a mischievous laugh.<br>"Enough talking now. Are you able to help this Queen bring that Asura God Stone to your world spirit space?" Her Lady Queen asked.<br>"That's an easy task," Chu Feng opened his world spirit gate and gently flicked his finger. The Asura God Stone was tossed into the Chu Feng's world spirit space through his world spirit gate.<br>"It really is something from the Asura Spirit World," Chu Feng gasped with admiration.<br>One must know that world spirit spaces were places that only world spirits could enter. Even for Chu Feng, he could only cast his consciousness inside and form an image of himself if he wanted to be in there.<br>In other words, Chu Feng could only enter his world spirit space in the form of a spirit. His physical body was simply unable to enter the world spirit space at all.<br>Furthermore, it was not only humans that were unable to enter the world spirit space; ordinary physical objects were also unable to enter it without using special methods to modify their nature.<br>As for that so-called Asura God Stone, Chu Feng did not use any special methods on it. Instead, he had thrown it inside directly. That was enough to verify how special it was.<br>"I truly never expected that you would have this sort of ability," Her Lady Queen was still looking at Chu Feng with an astonished expression.<br>"Well then, this Queen will go in to train," after looking at Chu Feng, Her Lady Queen entered the world spirit space.<br>"My Eggy, how is it? Are you able to train with it here?" Chu Feng cast his consciousness into his world spirit space.<br>"Absolutely. However, there is one thing that this Queen needs to tell you so that you do not worry yourself," Her Lady Queen said to Chu Feng.<br>"What is it?" Chu Feng revealed a worried expression upon hearing those words. From Her Lady Queen's words, Chu Feng was able to tell that what she would tell him was not good.<br>"Thanks to you, this Queen is now able to use it to train as much as I wish. For the sake of accelerating the speed of my training, this Queen will devote herself fully to training. In the period following, I will be akin to having entered closed-door training. I will not be able to hear anything you say to me. I will only return to normal when my training is over," Her Lady Queen said.<br>"Will there be any side-effects?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"No. I am merely unable to communicate with you while I am training, and will not know about what you've experienced during this period of time," Her Lady Queen said.<br>"If that is all, I will not have to worry about much. Milady Queen, go ahead and train at ease. I will also not disturb you anymore," as Chu Feng spoke, he planned to cast his consciousness back into his body and leave the world spirit space.<br>"Chu Feng, wait," however, seeing that Chu Feng was planning to leave, Her Lady Queen suddenly stopped him.<br>Seeing Her Lady Queen, Chu Feng's heart moved. He was able to tell that Her Lady Queen had a lot of things that she wanted to say to him.<br>However, in the end, Her Lady Queen merely smiled sweetly and said, "Take care of yourself. If something is to happen to you by the time this Queen exits her closed-door training, this Queen will definitely not forgive you."<br>"Well then, get out of here. Do not disturb this Queen's training," Her Lady Queen waved her hand.<br>"Yes, Milady," Chu Feng replied with a smile. After he finished saying those words, he left the world spirit space. However, Chu Feng was still capable of feeling what Her Lady Queen was doing.<br>Her Lady Queen's training would be just like her training that Chu Feng had witnessed earlier. He was unable to sense any power as she trained. However, Chu Feng knew that Her Lady Queen should already be completely submerged in training.<br>Her Lady Queen's closed-door training had begun.<br></p></div>
