        <div> - Strange Vortexes<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Everything in their surroundings was changing rapidly. Chu Feng and the others were unable to move in the slightest. It was as if their limbs were completely bound as their bodies drifted along a surging current.<br>However, Chu Feng was able to see the changes in the surrounding scenery. Initially, vast golden light had filled their surroundings. Soon, that golden light had turned into darkness. Although it was dark, many faintly discernible rays of light would sweep past them nonstop. Chu Feng was able to tell that there were countless such rays of light, so many that they were simply innumerable.<br>Chu Feng had experienced this once before.<br>Thus, Chu Feng knew that they had completely broken away from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, and were on their way to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>Not long from now, they would arrive at the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at the moment when they thought that they would be entering the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they slowed down.<br>After they slowed down, their surroundings became more distinctive.<br>Pitch blackness covered their surroundings. However, there were specks of starlight in the distance. At that moment, Chu Feng and the others were within a vast starry sky.<br>Upon raising his head, Chu Feng&rsquo;s pupils immediately shrunk back. Unease emerged in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s question, Zhao Hong, Wang Qiang, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi all raised their heads toward the direction that Chu Feng was looking at.<br>Upon seeing the situation ahead of them, their eyes also shrunk back. Then, they too revealed astonished expressions.<br>The reason for that was because there were four bodies of light ahead. Those bodies of light were circulating in a vortex-like manner. In that pitch-black starry sky, they looked extremely eye-catching. They were both very beautiful and somewhat strange.<br>&ldquo;Was it those things that decreased our speed?&rdquo; Zhao Hong asked. Evidently, she did not recognize those strange bodies of light that had appeared on the Stairway to Heaven either.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all get a bit closer to one another. Let&rsquo;s try our best to distance ourselves from those light vortexes,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>When they were rapidly traveling, their bodies had been unable to move.<br>However now that their speed had greatly decreased, they discovered that they were now capable of moving.<br>Even though they were still moving upward by the powers of the Stairway to Heaven, they were now able to move around.<br>After hearing Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s suggestion, Chu Feng and the others did as he said, and began to close their distance with one another. Soon, the five of them were leaning against one another.<br>&ldquo;Senior, do you know of those light vortexes?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I cannot be certain. However, I met with a senior from the Upper Realm in my youth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That senior mentioned to me that if I am to attempt to enter the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm in the future using the Stairway to Heaven, I must be careful if I am to encounter a kind of vortex.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That vortex would mean that an issue has occurred in the Stairway to Heaven. If one is to be drawn into the vortex, one might be sent to a different world, a different realm, should one be lucky. And, if one was unlucky, one might be sent directly to the vast Outer World.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It will be the vast Outer World with endless starry skies. You will not enter a certain world or a certain realm. Instead, you will truly be among the stars.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should one enter there, one will lose one&rsquo;s way, and spend eternity in darkness until they die from old age.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for these vortexes of light, they greatly resemble the vortex that senior mentioned,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>&ldquo;F-Fucking hell, w-why would t-th-this Stairway to H-Heaven be this dangerous?&rdquo; Wang Qiang had a displeased expression on his face.<br>&ldquo;That senior told me that even though those vortexes generally possess some attractive force, their attractive force is not very strong. As long as one is to keep away from the vortex, one will be able to escape a calamity. Thus, there is no need to worry excessively.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How did these things appear? Why would issues occur to the Stairway to Heaven? Could it be that they&rsquo;re man-made?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I asked that senior about this too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That senior said that the Stairway to Heaven was a sort of formation. As time passed, it would be normal for it to have issues. However, this was most definitely not man-made.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, this Stairway to Heaven is from the Ancient Era. How powerful must one be in order to destroy this Stairway to Heaven?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, he was determined that this was most definitely not caused by humans. Instead, it is an issue that occasionally appears because the Stairway to Heaven has been worn down by years of non-repair,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be careful. We are about to approach the first light vortex,&rdquo; Zhao Hong warned.<br>Even though their speed had decreased, it was actually still very fast. Originally, the first light vortex was very far away from them. However, it was now very close to them.<br>When it was far away, they did not feel much of anything from it. However, as it got near them, Chu Feng and the others discovered that the light vortex was no small matter.<br>That light vortex was very large. Before it, Chu Feng and the others were so insignificant and small that they looked like specks of dust.<br>That vortex shone upon an entire region like the bright sun.<br>However, the light it emitted was not fiery red. Instead, it was pure white. It was extremely clean. Looking at it, one could not feel any sense of danger. Instead, one would only feel that it was something very sacred.<br>However, when the light started to revolve, one would feel a sense of unease. The reason for that was because no one knew exactly where that vortex led to.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared. It will suffice if we keep our distance,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>Even though he was saying those words, his forehead was already covered in sweat.<br>The Stairway to Heaven was not hot. The reason why he was sweating like that was because he was nervous.<br>After all, they had only heard about the light vortex, and none of them actually knew how frightening it really was.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng and the others all grew quiet. They continued to look at the vast light vortex nervously.<br>Alertness and unease filled their eyes. However, apart from moving away from the incoming light vortex, there was nothing they could do.<br>After all, the Stairway to Heaven traveled according to a set route and they were unable to change that route.<br>Those light vortexes appeared at the edges of the routes.<br>Fortunately, they managed to avoid the first light vortex.<br>At that moment, they were safe.<br>&ldquo;Huuu~~~&rdquo;<br>Ying Mingchao heaved a long sigh of relief. Then, with a smile on his face, he said, &ldquo;It seemed that senior was correct.&rdquo;<br>Then, Chu Feng and the others also revealed relaxed smiles.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, a boundless attractive force suddenly emerged from the light vortex that they had just passed.<br>Most strangely of all, that attractive power restricted Chu Feng and only Chu Feng.<br>Soon, Chu Feng was sucked toward that light vortex by the attractive power.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng!!!&rdquo;<br>Wang Qiang and the others immediately started to panic. They wanted to grab onto Chu Feng. However, they were unable to.<br>Furthermore, they were still proceeding forward by the power of the Stairway to Heaven. They were simply unable to move back to attempt to rescue Chu Feng.<br>They could only look on helplessly as Chu Feng was sucked toward that light vortex. In the end, Chu Feng entered that light vortex.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Chu Feng entered the light vortex, the enormous light vortex suddenly disappeared.<br>It disappeared so fast that it was like it had disappeared in a split second. After the light vortex disappeared, the space beneath them turned pitch-black.<br>It was as if that light vortex was never there to begin with, as it did not leave behind any traces of its existence.<br>However, when they looked up, the three light vortexes were still present above them.<br>Merely, the light vortex that had sucked Chu Feng into it had disappeared.<br>&ldquo;D-D-Damn it! God damn i-it! E-exactly what t-the hell are these t-things?!&rdquo;<br>Wang Qiang was gnashing his teeth in anger. He was so worried that his face turned green. At that moment, he realized that those light vortexes weren&rsquo;t normal.<br>The reason for that was because the attractive power from before had only restricted Chu Feng. This was simply too unreasonable. It was as if that light vortex was deliberately there to capture Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Husband!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a miserable shout sounded from above.<br>Wang Qiang looked up and discovered that Zhao Hong was currently being sucked into one of the vortexes above.<br>After Zhao Hong was sucked into the light vortex, that light vortex also disappeared all of a sudden.<br>&ldquo;F-fucking hell! E-Exactly what t-the fuck is going&hellip; g-god damn it!&rdquo;<br>Wang Qiang started to curse out loud. However, before he could finish, he was also sucked away by a light vortex.<br>Like Chu Feng and Zhao Hong, Wang Qiang was also rapidly sucked into a light vortex. Then, that light vortex also disappeared.<br><br></p></div>
