        <div> - A Fine Line<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;What? He was actually the Beast Emperor, Black Dragon King?&rdquo; Hong Qiang opened his mouth wide in shock. Even Chu Feng and Baili Xuankong were feeling very surprised.<br>After all, hearing what Yaojiao Guang said, he seemed to be indicating that the Beast Emperor, the Black Dragon King, had a definite relationship with their King Monstrous Dragon Beast race.<br>&ldquo;It is as you all have thought, Lord Dragon King was a monstrous beast. Furthermore, he was a member of our King Monstrous Dragon Beast race. He is the hero of our King Monstrous Dragon Beast race,&rdquo; Yaojiao Guang said.<br>&ldquo;I have indeed heard that the Beast Emperor might have been a monstrous beast. However, that was only a possibility. Never would I have expected it to actually be true,&rdquo; The shock Baili Xuankong was feeling did not decrease in the slightest. It was very difficult for him to digest this matter.<br>&ldquo;Amazing! After the Five Emperors disappeared, no one knew anything about them. Not to mention their descendants, people don&rsquo;t even know where they were buried.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yet now, not long after the emergence of Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor, the Beast Emperor&rsquo;s successor is also about to emerge. This is truly astonishing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What are troubled times? These are troubled times!&rdquo; Hong Qiang exclaimed repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;When mentioning it, I am truly ashamed. Lord Dragon King possessed remarkable abilities. However, no one in our entire King Monstrous Dragon Race has been able to obtain his inheritance. Even for my daughter Tingyu, she only has a possibility of success.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, whether or not she will actually be able to obtain it will all depend on little friend Chu Feng&rsquo;s help. As long as little friend Chu Feng is willing to help, regardless of success or failure, I, Yaojiao Guang, will definitely remember this favor. If little friend Chu Feng were to need my assistance in the future, I would definitely risk my life and limb to help you out,&rdquo; Yaojiao Guang said as he looked to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you mean to say that as long as Princess Tingyu is able to obtain the inheritance, she will be the next Clan Chief?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That is indeed the case. Lord Dragon King possessed a special status in our King Monstrous Dragon Race. As long as Tingyu is capable of obtaining his inheritance, regardless of what her cultivation might be, she will still be able to become the next Clan Chief.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Merely, Tingyu has already attempted to obtain the inheritance many times. Although she was able to enter the Inheritance Pond left behind by Lord Dragon King, she was incapable of successfully obtaining the inheritance,&rdquo; When mentioning this matter, Yaojiao Guang had an expression of helplessness.<br>&ldquo;Am I really capable of helping in something like this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, do you still remember the pond in the Immortal Island?&rdquo; Yaojiao Guang asked.<br>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;The Inheritance Pond Lord Dragon King left behind resembles the Weaponry Refinement Immortal&rsquo;s Pond in some respects. One&rsquo;s talent is what determines whether one can enter that pond. As for whether or not one can obtain the inheritance in the pond, it depends on one&rsquo;s talent even more.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have heard that little friend Chu Feng possesses an extremely valiant talent. If you were to enter the Inheritance Pond alongside my daughter, you might be able to make the Inheritance Pond pass Lord Dragon King&rsquo;s power on to my daughter,&rdquo; Yaojiao Guang said.<br>After hearing those words, Chu Feng finally realized why Yaojiao Tingyu would invite him to be a guest after seeing him revealing his talent on the Immortal Island. Likely, she had wanted to request his assistance since that time.<br>&ldquo;But, what if after Chu Feng enters that Inheritance Pond and uses his talent to activate the Inheritance Pond, the Beast Emperor&rsquo;s power decides to pass the inheritance on to Chu Feng instead?&rdquo; Baili Xuankong asked.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry about that. The Inheritance Pond will only pass its power on to the younger generation of our King Monstrous Dragon Race. As long as little friend Chu Feng activates the Inheritance Pond, the power in the Inheritance Pond will begin to distinguish between the people within it before actually passing the power on to someone. As it will not be able to distinguish Chu Feng, it will naturally not pass its power onto Chu Feng. At that time, my daughter will be the only candidate to inherit the power,&rdquo; Yaojiao Guang said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, Chu Feng is willing to give it a try,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, please rest assured. Although the Four Great Imperial Clan's view you as their enemy, our King Monstrous Dragon Race does not fear them. If you are able to help my daughter become the successor to the position of Clan Chief, our King Monstrous Dragon Race is willing to protect your safety,&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng had actually agreed to help that straightforwardly after knowing the story, Yaojiao Guang was extremely happy, and actually promised to protect Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Thank you senior,&rdquo; Chu Feng also felt very grateful. He was able to tell that Yaojiao Guang was not joking around when he said those words.<br>It was true that Chu Feng needed more backers to protect him. At the very least, he needed people to protect him during the time of his growth. The King Monstrous Dragon Beasts were a very good option.<br>After that, Chu Feng, Hong Qiang and Baili Xuankong began to follow Yaojiao Guang, and began to journey toward the King Monstrous Dragon Race&rsquo;s territory.<br>On the way there, Chu Feng became increasingly surprised. The reason for that was because the direction in which Yaojiao Guang was proceeding was actually the same direction as where Jiang Wushang was currently located.<br>Ultimately, they arrived at their destination, and Chu Feng came to realize that the King Monstrous Dragon Race&rsquo;s territory was actually not the same location as where Jiang Wushang was. However, they were truly not far from Jiang Wushang&rsquo;s location.<br>The King Monstrous Dragon Race was located in an ancient mountain range. This mountain range had existed since the Ancient Era. Furthermore, the entire mountain range was covered by an invisible world spirit formation barrier. While that spirit formation was invisible, it possessed a defense that was much superior to that of the Nangong Imperial Clan&rsquo;s defensive barrier.<br>&ldquo;That spirit formation is amazing. May I know which world spiritist made it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;It was Lord Dragon King,&rdquo; Yaojiao Guang said.<br>&ldquo;The Beast Emperor was actually a world spiritist?&rdquo; Hong Qiang was extremely shocked. The reason why he was so shocked was because very few monstrous beasts possessed spirit power. Even if they were able to obtain spirit power, they would generally lack the talent for world spirit techniques.<br>However, the spirit formation that covered the mountain range was something that very few world spiritists in the entire current Holy Land of Martialism were capable of creating. From this, one could easily imagine how powerful the Beast Emperor&rsquo;s world spirit techniques were.<br>&ldquo;Brother Hong Qiang, truth be told, it is said that Lord Dragon King possessed extremely powerful world spirit techniques. It is said that he was only a fine line away from becoming a legendary Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,&rdquo; When mentioning this matter, Yaojiao Guang was extremely proud.<br>&ldquo;Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>Hong Qiang, Baili Xuankong and even Chu Feng all gasped in surprise. Immortal-cloak World Spiritists were existences akin to legend.<br>&ldquo;Nonsense! How could one become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist that easily? The way I see it, only you in the entire Holy Land of Martialism possesses the qualifications to become one,&rdquo; Eggy snorted disdainfully. She did not believe that the Beast Emperor had only been a fine line away from becoming an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, is it truly that difficult to become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Difficult. Of course it&rsquo;s difficult. Martial Kings are capable of becoming Royal-cloak World Spiritists. However, for Immortal-cloak World Spiritists, even Martial Emperors might not necessarily be able to become one. This is the disparity between them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Look at the number of Royal-cloak World Spiritists in the Holy Land of Martialism. Adding all of them up, it&rsquo;s still a very small number. But, what about the Martial Kings in the Holy Land of Martialism? How numerous are they?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;From this, it can be seen that the people from the Holy Land of Martialism are truly limited in mastering world spirit techniques. That being said, the Holy Land of Martialism&rsquo;s Ancient Era&rsquo;s Teleportation Formations are extremely extraordinary. They should be the products of Immortal-cloak World Spiritists. In the Ancient Era, there were most definitely Immortal-cloak World Spiritists in the Holy Land of Martialism,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;Mn, the Ancient Era was truly much more powerful than the Holy Land of Martialism is now,&rdquo; Chu Feng naturally knew how amazing the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Teleportation Formations were. Involuntarily, Chu Feng began to recall that bamboo slip in his dantian. Everything pointed to the cultivators of the Ancient Era being much stronger than the cultivators present now.<br>&ldquo;However, you do not have to be too discouraged. As far as I know, you are not far away from becoming a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, no? I feel like you will definitely become a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist before you become a Martial Emperor,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;I hope that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled lightly. Although Chu Feng needed to refine a great amount of cultivation resources in order to increase his martial cultivation, he was able to train in world spirit techniques normally and make comprehensions himself. It was as Eggy had said, Chu Feng was only a fine line away from becoming a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Likely, in the near future, another Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist would appear in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, please,&rdquo; Yaojiao Guang said. It turned out that Yaojiao Guang had opened an entrance in the spirit formation that sealed the mountain range.<br>As Chu Feng looked into the entrance that had been opened, his brows lifted slightly. He was surprised. When looking in from the outside, the inside of the spirit formation seemed to clearly be filled with vast mountains and towering giant trees.<br>However, when looking through that opened entrance, Chu Feng could see that the inside was filled with magnificent buildings and forts. It was a vast city.<br>Furthermore, eight hundred King Monstrous Dragon Beast experts had already walked out through that entrance. They stood in an orderly fashion to either side, then bent their knees and half-kneeled onto the ground.<br>Furthermore, there were thousands of King Monstrous Dragon Beast experts inside the entrance. They were all wearing thorny black armor as they stood there in a manner like guards.<br>&ldquo;So the inside is a completely different world. The King Monstrous Dragon Race is much more powerful than I had imagined.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had thought that the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts were inferior to the Nangong Imperial Clan the entire time. However, after seeing all this, he now knew that the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts were not at all inferior to the Nangong Imperial Clan. In fact, as a whole, the quality of their elites even surpassed those of the Nangong Imperial Clan.<br></p></div>
