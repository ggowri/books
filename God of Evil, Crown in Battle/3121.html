        <div> - What Sort Of Relationship<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Huu~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s clothes began to flutter, and his aura was completely released without any reservation, covering the entire region and leaving an imprint on the hearts of the crowd. Everyone present could sense Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura.<br>&ldquo;This aura!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd finally realized who it was that had smashed Chu Hongyi deep into the ground.<br>Upon finding out the answer to their confusion, they became extremely frightened.<br>It was not only the people that had tried to deliberately make things difficult for Chu Feng; even Chu Ping had an expression of shock.<br>That was because Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura was so powerful that it caused all of them to feel as if their blood was running cold.<br>&ldquo;Although I, Chu Feng, am not very strong, my cultivation is above yours. It&rsquo;s very normal for you all to be unable to sense my cultivation when it is concealed. Yet, you&rsquo;re calling this a sign of disrespect?&rdquo; Chu Feng ran his eyes over the crowd coldly.<br>&ldquo;No, no, of course not. Little brother Chu Feng, we were mistaken. It&rsquo;s our fault, it&rsquo;s all our fault,&rdquo; the crowd shook their heads repeatedly. They did not even dare to look Chu Feng in the face. Intense unease and fear filled their eyes.<br>&ldquo;As the saying goes, those that are ignorant are not at fault. Thus, I will not blame you all. However, there is one thing that I must declare.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the future, if you all are to feel dissatisfaction with me, Chu Feng, you can say it directly to me. However, please do not involve my father.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are to say it to me directly, I might let you get away with it. However, if anyone dares to speak ill of my father again&hellip;&rdquo; A chilly gaze flashed through Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes. Then, Chu Feng waved his palm downward.<br>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; A loud explosion sounded from where Chu Hongyi was. An enormous ravine-sized crater appeared. At the same time, Chu Hongyi let out an incomparably miserable scream.<br>&ldquo;... I will make you suffer pain a hundred times greater than what he suffered,&rdquo; Chu Feng pointed to Chu Hongyi.<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng looked to Chu Ping, &ldquo;Big brother Chu Ping, can you show us the way?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Very well. Little brother Chu Feng, little sister Shuangshuang, little brothers, I&rsquo;ll show you all around,&rdquo; Chu Ping nodded repeatedly. As he spoke, he began to fly toward their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory whilst guiding Chu Feng and the others.<br>The rest of the people were left behind. They were still standing in the sky with fear and shock on their faces.<br>Although Chu Hongyi was only seriously injured and would not die, the crowd knew that the suffering that Chu Hongyi would have sustained would have been much greater should Chu Feng have wanted it.<br>After a short moment passed, the crowd looked to one another in dismay.<br>They seemed to be asking one another, &lsquo;Why would that trash incapable of cultivation become such a frightening monster?&rsquo;<br>&hellip;...<br>Chu Ping arranged for separate residences for each member of Chu Feng&rsquo;s group.<br>From Chu Ping, they learned why there were so few people, yet so many palaces.<br>It turned out that many of the palaces were left behind by their seniors.<br>Chu Feng asked Chu Ping which palaces his father and grandfather had stayed in.<br>However, the answer he received was that they had not lived in any of the palaces there. That was because where they stayed was another place, another territory.<br>However, that territory no longer belonged to the Chu Heavenly Clan. Instead, it was occupied by another power.<br>When Chu Feng heard that he became very angry. He made the resolution to definitely take that territory back.<br>However, Chu Feng learned from Chu Ping that the power that had occupied their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s former territory was not only very powerful, but also had an enormous power behind them.<br>As for their Chu Heavenly Clan, they were completely alone with no one to rely on in there . As such, for now, their Chu Heavenly Clan was simply unable to afford provoking that power.<br>Chu Feng asked Chu Ping exactly how strong that power was, and how strong the power backing them was. However, Chu Ping did not give Chu Feng a precise answer.<br>Chu Feng only learned that the power that occupied their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s former territory was called the Burnfield Monstrous Clan.<br>As for the power that stood behind the Burnfield Monstrous Clan, they were called the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.<br>Actually, when considering the overall strength of their entire clan, the Burnfield Monstrous Clan was not as strong as the Chu Heavenly Clan. It was merely that their clansmen training inside the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm were stronger than the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>However, that Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan was different. Both their clansmen training in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm and their clan&rsquo;s overall power were stronger than the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Thus, Chu Ping warned Chu Feng and the others that they could offend the Burnfield Monstrous Clan should they have no other choice. However, they absolutely could not afford to provoke the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan.<br>After he finished arranging residences for Chu Feng and the others, Chu Ping left.<br>Chu Shuangshuang saw Chu Ping off by herself.<br>As the two of them were old friends, Chu Feng and the others did not involve themselves in the matter when Chu Shuangshuang decided to see Chu Ping away.<br>They were trying to give the two of them some time to chat with one another alone.<br>That said, what Chu Shuangshuang and Chu Ping ended up talking about were all matters concerning Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng is actually that amazing?!&rdquo;<br>Chu Ping had an expression of shock. Chu Shuangshuang had already informed him about everything that had happened in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>&ldquo;The son of Chu Xuanyuan does not have an undeserved reputation,&rdquo; Chu Shuangshuang spoke with a faint smile.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. It could be seen from how he took care of Chu Hongyi today; he truly does possess the airs of a king,&rdquo; Chu Ping gasped with admiration.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Ping, how is your relationship with Chu Hongyi right now?&rdquo; Chu Shuangshuang asked.<br></p></div>
