        <div> - Death From Greed<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon entering the spirit formation, Chu Feng quickly discovered an issue.<br>The spirit formation that had been arranged mainly by the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, was not only meant to trigger the ice layer&rsquo;s protective formation, it also needed to fuse with the protective formation.<br>If the two spirit formations successfully fused with one another, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted would not only successfully breach the ice layer, he would also gain control over the power of the protective formation.<br>Although Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know exactly how powerful the ice layer&rsquo;s protective formation was, he was certain that it was most definitely not something that the people present could handle.<br>If the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted managed to gain control over the protective formation&rsquo;s power, it would be equivalent to him having obtained the Dragon Vein Source Stone.<br>It would be very difficult for Chu Feng to seize control of the spirit formation from the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>He needed to advance in secret. He could not allow the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted to discover him and his attempt at taking control. This sharply increased the difficulty of taking control over the spirit formation.<br>However, Chu Feng remained confident. In fact, he was even excited.<br>In his previous two confrontations with the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted, he and his friends had ultimately won in both confrontations.<br>But, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had made Chu Feng suffer quite a bit. He had even nearly killed Chu Feng twice.<br>This time around, Chu Feng was determined to thoroughly defeat the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>He wanted to write off all the former hatred that he felt for the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted in a single stroke.<br>There were two steps to breaching the protective formation.<br>First, they needed to trigger the true power of the protective formation.<br>Only by finding out exactly how powerful the protective formation was could they proceed to fuse the unsealing formation with it.<br>At that moment, the unsealing formation had turned into golden gases that were pounding against the layer of ice.<br>&ldquo;Snap~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Snap~~~&rdquo;<br>Soon, cracks appeared on the ice. Through the cracks, white gas flowed out.<br>The gas emitted from the ice should be cold. Yet, those gases were emitting a strange sense of heat.<br>As the heat soared into the air, it soon covered their surroundings.<br>After the heat covered the surroundings, many people revealed joyous looks. Some even started to laugh sinisterly.<br>They were all inside the formation core. Thus, why would they suddenly be responding with such ecstasy?<br>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;<br>Soon, Chu Feng discovered that things were amiss.<br>The heat was a sort of illusion formation. It was capable of trapping one inside its illusion.<br>Although Chu Feng had realized that things were amiss, the illusion formation was simply too powerful. Just like that, he too was trapped in the illusion.<br>That said, even though Chu Feng had been caught in the illusion, his consciousness remained very clear.<br>Thus, it did not take long for him to breach the illusion and regain full awareness of his surroundings.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng regained his awareness, he soon heard explosions.<br>Looking over, he discovered that the experts that were present had exploded and died.<br>After they exploded and died, their blood did not spread out. Instead, their blood was engulfed by the heat. Even their treasures were devoured by the heat.<br>It was as if they&rsquo;d never been here. Just like that, they had disappeared completely.<br>Chu Feng was not surprised by this at all.<br>He knew very well why those people had died.<br>That illusion was a choice. If one possessed greed, then one would most definitely die.<br>Knowing the rules of the illusion very well, Chu Feng made the correct decision.<br>However, those people had clearly had no idea that they had been caught in an illusion. They had believed that they would be able to obtain the Dragon Vein Source Stone by killing the others present.<br>Unfortunately, if they ended up doing that in their illusions, they would instead be killed by the illusion formation.<br>On the other hand, if one didn&rsquo;t do that, one would not only be able to survive, but one would also gain acknowledgement from the protective formation.<br>Although Chu Feng had managed to escape the illusion formation and had obtained its acknowledgement, he did not move rashly. Instead, he pretended to have failed to breach the illusion formation, exploded, and died.<br>Chu Feng was pretending to be dead.<br>After pretending that he was dead, Chu Feng began to secretly control the spirit formation.<br>The reason for that was because even though he had gained the acknowledgement of the protective formation, he had not obtained its power.<br>He needed to continue using the unsealing formation to fuse with the protective formation in order to obtain its power.<br>However, he didn&rsquo;t want the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted to discover him doing so. Thus, he pretended to be dead so that he could continue to control the unsealing formation to fuse with the protective formation in the shadows.<br>After Chu Feng pretended to be dead, the others present began to dying in succession. The only difference was that their deaths were real.<br>That said, there was an exception to the case. That would be the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted had also managed to breach the illusion formation. He had quickly regained his awareness, and had even personally witnessed the deaths of those experts.<br>After seeing that everyone had died, a smile appeared on his face. He Mockingly said, &ldquo;A bunch of fools. And here I was thinking that I&rsquo;d have to gain the power of the grand formation in order to take care of you all. Who would&rsquo;ve thought that you&rsquo;d all be such disappointments as to die like this?&rdquo;<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was especially pleased with himself. He was also filled with confidence. After all, everyone had died and he had managed to successfully fuse with the protective formation in order to gain control over its power.<br>Even if those people were still alive they would not be a match for him.<br>In fact, even if stronger experts came, they also wouldn't be a match for him.<br>He had become the ruler of that entire region. None could match him there.<br>Even though the layer of ice still hadn&rsquo;t completely shattered, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted walked over to it and effortlessly passed through it to reach the bottom of the barrier.<br>It was precisely because he had obtained the power of the protective formation that he was able to do that.<br>The ice layer was the embodiment of the protective formation.<br>Standing at the depths of the ice and seeing the readily available Dragon Vein Source Stone, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted became endlessly excited.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, just when he extended his hand with the intention of grabbing the Dragon Vein Source Stone, a black figure suddenly swept past him.<br>In an instant, the Dragon Vein Source Stone had disappeared.<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted shifted his gaze, and discovered someone standing before him.<br>It was the world spiritist that had come to their aid at the end.<br>That world spiritist was naturally no other person than Chu Feng.<br>Most importantly, the Dragon Vein Source Stone was in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; you&rsquo;re alive?&rdquo;<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was very surprised to see Chu Feng.<br>After all, he had personally witnessed him exploding and dying.<br>&ldquo;How could I die when you didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he placed the Dragon Vein Source Stone into his Cosmos Sack.<br>His action had completely infuriated the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Courting death!&rdquo;<br>With a furious shout, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted shot forth his palm. Like an eagle&rsquo;s claw, his hand moved to grab Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>His claw-hand was extremely powerful. If grabbed by it, Chu Feng&rsquo;s face would likely be completely crushed.<br>But, when the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s hand landed on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face, he was suddenly stunned.<br>He was shocked to discover that Chu Feng&rsquo;s face was even tougher than treasure-level metals. Even though he was a rank four Utmost Exalted, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was not only unable to crush Chu Feng&rsquo;s face, he was unable to cause even the slightest bit of injury to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder you were able to survive.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So you actually have a protective treasure on you.&rdquo;<br>The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted soon moved backwards quickly. When he looked at Chu Feng again, there was a change in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Protective treasure?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You actually failed to distinguish between a spirit formation and a protective treasure?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So the renowned Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted is only this competent,&rdquo; mocked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; The Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted was not angered by Chu Feng&rsquo;s ridicule. Instead, he let out a strange laugh.<br>&ldquo;Did you really think that you&rsquo;d be able to contend against me just because you have a protective treasure?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon have you know who the actual ruler of this place is.&rdquo;<br>After his words left his mouth, the ice layer began to crumble. Boundless white gaseous flames rushed to attack Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng did not attempt to dodge the incoming white gaseous flames. He was quickly submerged in them.<br>The white gaseous flames were even emitting a strange roar.<br>It was as if what had engulfed Chu Feng were not flames at all, but rather ferocious beasts from hell itself.<br>There was no need to mention how fierce the white gaseous flames were.<br>Logically, after being attacked by such a terrifying power, it should be impossible for one to survive.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?&rdquo;<br>But, the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s expression had changed enormously. Panic appeared in his eyes.<br>The white gaseous flames he was attacking Chu Feng with was the power of the grand protective formation.<br>However, to his enormous surprise, the power of the grand protective formation was actually unable to take care of the person standing before him!<br></p></div>
