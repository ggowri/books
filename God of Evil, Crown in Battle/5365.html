        <div><span>: Cultivation Tower</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t hesitate to use the awakened Life Crystal on Eggy, but to his disappointment, its effectiveness paled in comparison to the one he had used earlier. That made him even more determined to gather more Life Crystals.</span><br><span>He was certain that there were more Life Crystals in the vicinity, but he still had no idea how to obtain them. Furthermore, there were many experts lurking in the area; he dared not to make a reckless move. This left him with no choice but to wait for the return of the lord whom the old woman mentioned.</span><br><span>He could only pray that the lord would spare him a couple of Life Crystals in view of Old Man Zhou, or else he would have to explore alternative solutions.</span><br><span>Both Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing turned their attention toward the crystals they had nurtured during the trial. Chu Feng absorbed the energy within his crystal, and initially, he was a little disappointed that it didn&rsquo;t raise his spirit power by much.</span><br><span>But when Bai Yunqing started excitedly prancing around the room, he noticed that something was amiss.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The cultivation resource of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion sure is incredible! Big brother Chu Feng, are you close to making a breakthrough too?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re close to a breakthrough?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! What about you?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be. You&rsquo;re only at White Dragon God-cloak and your crystal was at a much higher tier than mine; it doesn&rsquo;t make sense that you aren&rsquo;t even close to a breakthrough.&rdquo; Bai Yunqing was baffled.</span><br><span>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know how he could answer the question since he didn&rsquo;t know what was going on either. He could only reply, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me for now. Since you&rsquo;re already close to a breakthrough, you should quickly go and cultivate. Don&rsquo;t squander this precious opportunity.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll go cultivate now!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing also knew that this was the ideal opportunity for him to push for a breakthrough, so he quickly sat back down and resumed his cultivation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, could your Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline have greatly increased the difficulty for you to make a breakthrough?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>She was present when Chu Feng was cultivating earlier, and she could tell that the energy within Chu Feng&rsquo;s crystal was formidable.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That should be the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>He wasn&rsquo;t certain about the exact reason, but it was plausible that it was related to his bloodline. He had only partially awakened his Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline, but it had raised his fighting prowess far beyond his peers. Such power came at a price for him, in the sense that it was much harder for him to make a breakthrough.</span><br><span>Stronger powers were bound to come with caveats, and if one couldn&rsquo;t overcome the difficulties, it would only become a burden.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Power does come at a price, but this is a good thing,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo; Chu Feng expressed his agreement. He was already accustomed to facing difficulties in his cultivation.</span><br><span>Knowing that he was unlikely to make a breakthrough in his spirit power any time soon, he turned his attention toward the martial skill he had obtained from the Heavenly Sacred Temple not too long ago, Exalted Taboo Shadow Severing Hack.</span><br><span>The martial skill was harder to grasp than he had expected. He could speed up the process if there was a specialized place for him to practice the skill, or else it would take him some time.</span><br><span>The following day, Jie Yu paid him a visit once again. He brought some local delicacies from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion together with him.</span><br><span>While they were having a casual chat over the delicacies, Jie Yu inquired about Eggy&rsquo;s injuries, seemingly wanting to offer some help. Unfortunately, he was put in a spot when he learned that Chu Feng needed more Life Crystals.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You should have realized it by now, but Life Crystals are a precious resource in our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. I&rsquo;m afraid that I don&rsquo;t have any way to secure more Life Crystals for you,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I know that Life Crystals was an invaluable treasure. You have already done me a huge </span><span>favor with the one you have given me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied. In the first place, he wasn&rsquo;t counting on Jie Yu to acquire more Life Crystals for him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I might not be able to help you obtain more Life Crystals, but feel free to ask anything from me!&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are there any places where I can practice my martial skills?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course! There is a cultivation tower nearby that aids in not just grasping martial skills but formations too. Are you interested? I can bring you over if you wish,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The elder from before told us not to leave this place,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;No worries, I&rsquo;ll bring you there. She won&rsquo;t say a thing,&rdquo; Jie Yu replied.</span><br><span>Those were the words Chu Feng was waiting for. &ldquo;Is it convenient to head there now?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;It is convenient. Come, I&rsquo;ll take you there,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>Following Jie Yu, Chu Feng soon found himself standing before a brick tower. Despite its humble and aged appearance, it was suffused with incredible spirit power that drew in the surrounding natural energies.</span><br><span>An old man guarded the tower entrance. He wasn&rsquo;t emanating any energy, but Chu Feng could sense that he was an extremely powerful individual, probably surpassing even the black-haired and white-haired women.</span><br><span>The old man opened the gate right away upon noticing Jie Yu.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master Jie Yu, are you looking to learn a formation?&rdquo; the old man asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;My friend over here wants to learn a martial skill. I&rsquo;ll be troubling you to bring him in,&rdquo; Jie Yu said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;All right. Young master, please follow me.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The old man remained polite toward Chu Feng despite knowing that he was an outsider, not showing any hints of contempt or disdain at all.</span><br><span>Chu Feng followed the old man into the tower, where he found a spirit formation gate sitting at the center of the tower. Other than that, there was a flight of stairs that allowed one to scale the tower. However, the flight of stairs seemed to be imbued with a formation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master, what&rsquo;s the level of martial skill you are looking to cultivate?&rdquo; the old man asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Rank nine Exalted Taboo,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>The old man showed nary a reaction to Chu Feng&rsquo;s answer as if there was nothing surprising about it. He took out two bamboo slips and passed them to Chu Feng. Written on the bamboo slips were the numbers &lsquo;19&rsquo; and &lsquo;20&rsquo;.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The 19th floor should suffice for a rank nine Exalted Taboo. If you find the pressure insufficient, you may head to the 20th floor instead,&rdquo; the old man said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Thanks, elder.&rdquo; Chu Feng took the bamboo slips and headed into the spirit formation gate.</span><br><span>The old man suddenly said, &ldquo;Young master, take heed to return via the spirit formation </span><span>gate too. Under no circumstances should you take the stairs.&rdquo;</span><br></p></div>
