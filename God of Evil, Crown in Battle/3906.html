        <h1>Chapter 3905</h1>
        <div> - Beautiful Deer<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The place he appeared at was covered densely with trees. Practically every inch of the ground was covered by trees. Merely, those trees were especially short and small. They were actually only a foot tall.<br>Seeing those trees, Chu Feng felt as if he was a giant.<br>That said, the flowers there were enormous.<br>Some flowers were thousands of meters tall, and covered the sky.<br>Seeing those flowers, Chu Feng felt as if he was as small as an ant.<br>The sky there was extremely blue, like the deep sea. The clouds were also very bizarre. Even the sun was especially large.<br>The sun there was over a hundred times larger than an ordinary sun. Thus, that place was particularly bright.<br>Most importantly, every inch of the earth, every single plant, everything there, emitted an intense Ancient Era&rsquo;s aura.<br>Chu Feng felt as if he had entered a world from the Ancient Era.<br>&ldquo;Could this be because of that paper?&rdquo;<br>No matter what, Chu Feng was a rather experienced person.<br>He knew that he wouldn&rsquo;t possibly have entered a vortex for no reason, and then arrive in such a bizarre world.<br>If he had to explain it, then the paper that Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother considered to be their family treasure would have the greatest possibility of being the cause of everything.<br>Right when Chu Feng was pondering deeply, a voice was suddenly heard. &ldquo;Ah, what the hell is this?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited for so many years, why do I keep encountering this sort of trash?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, I guess you can reluctantly make do.&rdquo;<br>It was a woman&rsquo;s voice. It was also very pleasant to hear.<br>Chu Feng turned around. However, he saw no woman. Instead, he saw a deer.<br>The deer was many times larger than an ordinary deer.<br>Furthermore, its appearance also stood out from the masses. It seemed to be made of precious jade. It was very beautiful, simply a piece of art.<br>However, that jade-like deer was clearly able to move. Furthermore, it was staring at Chu Feng.<br>In addition to that, the deer&rsquo;s eyes were filled with intelligence. From a glance, one could tell from those eyes that it was not an ordinary being.<br>Chu Feng immediately stood up and bowed respectfully to the deer before asking respectfully, &ldquo;Senior, could it be that you&rsquo;re the legendary Ancient Era&rsquo;s secret skill?&rdquo;<br>According to Chu Feng&rsquo;s guess, the deer before him was very likely the Ancient Era&rsquo;s secret skill Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother had spoken of.<br>The reason why Chu Feng felt this way was because of the picture on the paper.<br>Although the picture resembled a scribble, was very ugly and looked to have absolutely no connection with the magnificent deer before him, it just so happened that that scribble-like animal&rsquo;s shape greatly resembled the deer.<br>&ldquo;What is a secret skill?&rdquo;<br>As the deer spoke, its body began to change.<br>It turned into a woman, a very beautiful woman. Her beauty was simply unstoppable.<br>Apart from Her Lady Queen, Chu Feng had never seen another beauty as stunning as the woman before him.<br>Furthermore, the woman before him wore nothing at all.<br>In one&rsquo;s most primitive appearance, she stood before Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please wear something.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng immediately turned around. He did not dare to look anymore. He was so afraid that he even closed his eyes.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t want to continue looking. How could Chu Feng not want to look at such an enchanting beauty?<br>He was truly afraid to look anymore. He was able to tell that the woman that deer transformed into was extremely powerful. Chu Feng did not dare to offend her.<br>&ldquo;Aiyoh, what&rsquo;s this? Could you be embarrassed?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the future, you&rsquo;ll be riding me. How could you be embarrassed with just this?&rdquo;<br>The woman arrived before Chu Feng. She held Chu Feng&rsquo;s chin and forcibly brought his eyes to look at her body.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng turned around. Since he didn&rsquo;t want to look, but was instead being forced to look, he would not be the one being rude.<br>That said, at the instant Chu Feng opened his eyes, slight disappointment entered his heart.<br>The reason for that was because the woman had put on clothes. It was a cyan skirt that was very plain. However, it was very beautiful on that woman.<br>Most importantly, that woman was simply too beautiful. Seeing her, Chu Feng felt his heart accelerate.<br>Apart from when he'd first seen Her Lady Queen, Chu Feng had never felt this way toward any other woman.<br>&lsquo;Wait, something&rsquo;s wrong.&rsquo;<br>Although the woman was extremely beautiful; regardless of whether it was her face or her figure, they were both outstanding and incomparable, she would, at the very most, be at Yan Ruyu&rsquo;s tier of beauty.<br>Although beauty of that level was very rare, it was not enough to make Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart accelerate so much.<br>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the aura emitted by this woman.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;She possesses a special charm. It&rsquo;s that charm that&rsquo;s causing me to act this way.&rsquo;<br>Chu Feng immediately stepped back and broke free from the woman.<br>Charmed. Chu Feng felt that he had been charmed. Like a fox-spirit, the woman was capable of charming people.<br>With how powerful Chu Feng&rsquo;s spiritual resistance was, he had not expected that he would be charmed by the woman.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too shy. With how shy and trashy you are, how are you supposed to become this god&rsquo;s master?&rdquo; The woman looked at Chu Feng with a beaming smile.<br>Her every movement, every frown and every smile, were so very charming.<br>However, the more that was the case, the less Chu Feng dared to look her in the eye.<br>Chu Feng had met many beauties. Many of them were alluring and charming.<br>Yet, when compared to the woman before him, those women he'd met all became unworthy.<br>The woman before him was truly what alluring and enchanting meant.<br>She was capable of charming even Chu Feng, capable of causing even someone with Chu Feng&rsquo;s resistance to lose control of himself.<br>&ldquo;Senior, could it be that you&rsquo;re not a secret skill?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be that you&rsquo;re not the one on that paper?&rdquo;<br>Although Chu Feng felt the woman to be very dangerous, he still questioned her.<br>Chu Feng wanted to confirm if the woman&rsquo;s appearance had anything to do with the paper Gou Za&rsquo;s grandmother had given him.<br>&ldquo;What paper? What are you talking about?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This god only knows that after I woke up, I&rsquo;ve been waiting for a master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, the people that this god has encountered all these years are all trash. None of them are qualified to be this god&rsquo;s master.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for you&hellip; although you&rsquo;re not up to much yourself.&rdquo; The woman smiled charmingly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re rather outstanding compared to those trash.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ah, comparisons, the most fearful thing. Although you&rsquo;ve also not met this god&rsquo;s requirements, this god has simply stayed here for too long, way too long. I want to go out and have a look.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the woman&rsquo;s body shifted, and she turned into a ray of light that revolved around Chu Feng. When she stopped, she arrived before Chu Feng and returned to human form. She was staring at Chu Feng with a deeply emotional gaze, and her delicate little hands were on his shoulders.<br>&ldquo;Thus, are you able to bring this god out?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;re willing to bring this god out, I&rsquo;m able to agree to anything you might want me to do.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, that woman&rsquo;s voice turned particularly gentle and soft.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng immediately distanced himself from her.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t wish to be intimate with the woman. On the contrary, his heart was beating extremely fast. Furthermore, a peculiar sort of feeling had engulfed his entire body.<br>Chu Feng deeply wanted to be even more intimate with the woman. He even had the urge to embrace her.<br>However, this was simply unreasonable. Chu Feng was not someone who lacked control. He was not someone who wanted to hug any beauty he encountered.<br>Otherwise, how could Chu Feng have refused all the beauties that had wanted him over the years?<br>Thus, Chu Feng knew that even though he had kept his distance from the woman, he was still being charmed by her.<br>After distancing himself, Chu Feng asked, &ldquo;Senior, are you trapped here?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
