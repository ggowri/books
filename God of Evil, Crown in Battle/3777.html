        <div> - His Secret<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Earlier, Chu Feng had not observed things with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, or sensed with his spirit power.<br>However, after using his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to observe that Old Freak Tang, Chu Feng discovered many suspicious things.<br>Firstly, although Old Freak Tang seemed to be a commoner, his smithy actually had a layer of spirit formations around it. It was a protective formation that was capable of hiding things.<br>Furthermore, that spirit formation was the work of a Dragon Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist.<br>It was obvious that a world spiritist of that level did not live in Autumnfall Village.<br>Thus, that spirit formation served as sufficient proof that Old Freak Tang was an extraordinary individual.<br>Besides the spirit formation around his smithy, Old Freak Tang himself was also acting very strangely.<br>If he were truly afraid of Chu Feng, he would likely be feeling lingering fear from his encounter with him. Even after Chu Feng had left, it should take him a while to calm down.<br>However, he did not appear to be feeling any lingering fear at all. After Chu Feng left, the terrified appearance disappeared completely.<br>This meant that the fear he had displayed toward Chu Feng earlier was nothing more than a disguise.<br>All of this brought joy to Chu Feng.<br>He was now practically certain that Old Freak Tang was the person he was searching for.<br>However, for some unknown reason, Old Freak Tang was trying to conceal his identity, and was unwilling to admit who he was to Chu Feng.<br>That said, Chu Feng would naturally not be willing to easily give up.<br>After Chu Feng left, that Old Freak Tang returned to his bedroom and sat down cross-legged.<br>He began to release his spirit power, which soon covered the entire village.<br>After his spirit power was released, Chu Feng was able to tell that Old Freak Tang was a rather extraordinary world spiritist. He was a Dragon Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist.<br>This served to explain that he was actually the one who had set up the spirit formation around his smithy.<br>Furthermore, although Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s spirit power had enveloped the entire village, it was ultimately fixed on a single family.<br>It turned out that Old Freak Tang was monitoring a single person.<br>The person he was monitoring was an old lady.<br>Although she was an old lady, she was actually not excessively old for a martial cultivator, being merely over a thousand years old.<br>Many cultivators would be able to maintain their appearances well at such an age.<br>This was especially true for women. Many of them kept their middle-aged appearances. In fact, there were a lot of women that kept their youthful appearances too.<br>However, that old lady looked extremely old. Furthermore, her health was extremely weak.<br>She seemed like she would not be able to live for much longer.<br>&ldquo;Why is Old Freak Tang monitoring that old lady?&rdquo;<br>This question flashed through Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind. After all, that old lady simply appeared too ordinary.<br>She did not possess any looks, nor did she possess a high cultivation. She also did not resemble someone with secrets.<br>In fact, Chu Feng felt that the old lady would die soon.<br>Old Freak Tang continued to monitor the old lady until nightfall. Only then did he retrieve his spirit power, stand up and walk out of his smithy.<br>Seeing that Old Freak Tang was leaving his smithy, Chu Feng immediately and secretly followed him.<br>Old Freak Tang was extremely fast. He was so fast that Chu Feng was unable to catch up to him even when he went all-out to chase after him.<br>Chu Feng felt that even though Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s world spirit techniques were only those of a Dragon Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist and was weaker than his, his cultivation far surpassed that of his own.<br>It was very possible for Old Freak Tang to be an Utmost Exalted-level expert.<br>After all, if Chu Feng were to go all-out, his battle power would be on par with a peak Exalted.<br>Yet, even with that being the case, he still found it very difficult to keep up with Old Freak Tang. With that, it seemed obvious that Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s cultivation should be that of an Utmost Exalted.<br>Although Chu Feng could not keep up with Old Freak Tang in terms of speed, he still had his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, which could see very far.<br>Furthermore, the place where Old Freak Tang was heading was not far from Autumnfall Village.<br>Thus, in the end, Chu Feng managed to catch up to Old Freak Tang.<br>The place where Old Freak Tang had arrived was a sect by the name of Void Cleanse Monastery.<br>This Void Cleanse Monastery would actually be considered to be a small sect in the Reincarnation Upper Realm.<br>Although it had hundreds of thousands of people, the strongest person in the sect only possessed the cultivation of a Martial Immortal.<br>The great majority of the people in the sect were Heavenly Immortals and True Immortals. As for the disciples, they were even weaker.<br>Not to mention Old Freak Tang, even Chu Feng would be able to enter and leave a sect like that completely unhindered, completely undetected.<br>That said, as Old Freak Tang was very powerful, Chu Feng did not dare to approach him, and had to observe the situation from afar.<br>With Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s cultivation, even if Chu Feng had concealed himself with his Saint-cloak World Spiritist ability, he would still be detected should he follow Old Freak Tang too closely.<br>As it turned out, Old Freak Tang had arrived at the Void Cleanse Monastery to secretly monitor another individual.<br>The person he was monitoring was a woman. Judging from her appearance, she should be an elder of the Void Cleanse Monastery.<br>That woman had a fair appearance and a tall figure. She could be said to be a beauty. Although she was not a beauty so devastatingly beautiful that she could cause the downfall of a city or state, she was very charming to the eyes.<br>Furthermore, that woman had a decent cultivation.<br>She was a rank one Heavenly Immortal.<br>&ldquo;Could it be&hellip; Old Freak Tang is married to that old lady?&rdquo; Suddenly, this thought came to Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind.<br>The reason why he thought that way was because of the appearance of the woman Old Freak Tang was monitoring.<br>The woman was rather good-looking. Her appearance could be said to be from a completely different world from the ugly Old Freak Tang and the ordinary-looking old lady.<br>However, it just so happened that Chu Feng was able to detect traces of resemblance to Old Freak Tang and the old lady on that woman.<br>It could be said that all of the small amounts of good features Old Freak Tang and the old lady possessed were inherited by that woman.<br>Since that woman possessed the features of both Old Freak Tang and that old lady, it meant that it was possible that she was their daughter.<br>Furthermore, Old Freak Tang was looking at the woman with eyes filled with affection. Those eyes greatly resembled the eyes of a father looking at his daughter.<br>If that woman was indeed Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s daughter, his seemingly strange behavior could be explained.<br>After this idea came to his mind, Chu Feng immediately began to secretly investigate the woman and the old lady.<br>After investigating them, Chu Feng discovered that the woman was called Song Ge, and she was indeed that old lady&rsquo;s daughter.<br>Merely, no one knew who Song Ge's father was. Her mother had also never mentioned who her father was either.<br>Thus, Song Ge had actually taken her mother&rsquo;s surname.<br>After this investigation, Chu Feng became even more certain that his guess was correct.<br>This Song Ge must be Old Freak Tang and that old lady&rsquo;s daughter.<br>Merely, due to some reason, Old Freak Tang was unable to recognize Song Ge as his daughter. He was also unable to see Song Ge&rsquo;s mother. Thus, he could only monitor the two of them from afar.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Early in the morning of the next day, Old Freak Tang returned to his smithy in Autumnfall Village.<br>Chu Feng decided to lay his cards out with him. Thus, he went to pay him a visit again.<br>&ldquo;Cough, cough, cough&hellip;&rdquo;<br>However, before Chu Feng even approached the smithy, he was able to hear Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s intense and painful coughing.<br>Actually, Old Freak Tang had coughed countless times in the night that Chu Feng had observed him. Furthermore, every time he coughed, he would cough up blood, and start panting afterwards.<br>Chu Feng felt that Old Freak Tang must be seriously ill.<br>That said, the coughing session this time around was particularly intense and painful.<br>Thus, Chu Feng directly pushed the door open and released his spirit power to envelop Old Freak Tang and began to treat him..<br>&ldquo;You?!&rdquo;<br>After Old Freak Tang saw Chu Feng, he immediately revealed a look of surprise.<br>His surprise was not from Chu Feng&rsquo;s sudden appearance. Instead, he was surprised by Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power being Saint level.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please don&rsquo;t say anything for now. Allow this junior to diagnose your condition first.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he began to use his spirit power to diagnose Old Freak Tang&rsquo;s condition.<br>However, after doing so, Chu Feng started to frown.<br>Old Freak Tang was suffering from an incurable disease. Furthermore, he had reached the terminal stage.<br>Frankly, Old Freak Tang would not be able to live for much longer. Even Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands were tied.<br>He could only alleviate his suffering, and was incapable of saving his life.<br></p></div>
