        <h1>Chapter 4646</h1>
        <div>: Clash of the Asuras<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eggy&rsquo;s little hands were not just fair, they were also delicately shaped as well. There was no man who wouldn&rsquo;t want to touch hands like hers.<br>However, the claw of black aura she had released was horrifying and powerful. It was so strong that even the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit wasn&rsquo;t able to struggle free of it no matter what he did.<br>Thie situation left the crowd of the Nine Souls Galaxy feeling utterly despaired.<br>It was then that the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit began howling furiously.<br>&ldquo;I admit that you do have a bit of capability. However, do you think that someone of the Asura Blood Tribe like me would be defeated by the likes of you?&rdquo;<br>As the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit said those words, his voice began to change. His cries of agony stopped, and his eyes turned ferocious.<br>Following that, blood-red seals began surfacing from his skin, gradually becoming clearer and clearer.<br>These seals were extremely eerie. Fluid like blood, they wiggled as if they had a life of their own.<br>With the appearance of these seals, the power of the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit began to rise once more.<br>Shoosh!<br>The Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit flung his sleeves lightly, and the claw of black aura that he was unable to deal with previously immediately dissipated.<br>&ldquo;How powerful! Is that the true strength of the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have imagined that he was actually concealing his strength all this while!&rdquo;<br>The gloomy atmosphere on the spectator stands suddenly hyped up once more upon seeing the performance of the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit.<br>In truth, those on the VIP stand at the moment were all powerhouses of the Nine Souls Galaxy, such that many of them did possess strength greater than the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit.<br>However, just the airs that were emanated by the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit left these powerhouses feeling a little uneasy inside. It was almost as if something was suppressing the depths of their souls.<br>It was only due to the difference in their cultivation that these powerhouses were able to retain their composure. If they were really on the same cultivation level, it was unlikely that any of them would have been able to match this world spirit.<br>This was more than enough to show just how powerful Asura Blood Tribe was. Its powerful reputation was indeed not hearsay.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, are you able to deal with him?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had already released Eggy from his hug, and he asked her with eyes filled with concern.<br>He had also sensed the changes occurring with the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit too. Even though the world spirit&rsquo;s cultivation didn&rsquo;t rise this time around, there was no denying that his fighting prowess had increased to a terrifying level.<br>At the very least, Chu Feng was feeling greatly pressured by the airs emanated by the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit. So, he wasn&rsquo;t certain if Eggy was really able to deal with the world spirit or not.<br>&ldquo;Asura Blood Tribe? Mere small fry. Watch how this Queen eradicates him.&rdquo;<br>In contrast to everyone else, Eggy had a calm look on her face. She took several steps forward to stand in front of Chu Feng and Yu Sha, finally coming face-to-face with the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit.<br>&ldquo;Small fry? You harlot, are you talking about me?&rdquo; the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit asked.<br>&ldquo;There are only two small fry on the stage right now. One is you, and the other one is your master. The one I&rsquo;m fighting with is you right now, so who else could I possibly be referring to?&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>While Gongsun Yuntian wasn&rsquo;t saying anything, his complexion turned incredibly livid. Eggy was also insulting him here.<br>The Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit, however, was far more fiery-tempered than Gongsun Yuntian. His gaze turned savage as infernos of rage burned in his mind.<br>&ldquo;Today, I shall let you know why the Asura Blood Tribe is known as the strongest tribe in the Asura Spirit World!&rdquo;<br>The Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit roared with a jarring voice, causing a sonic boom that created cracks in space. He channeled his blood-red aura outward in waves, smashing the space that stood in its path again and again.<br>At the same time, his body also began undergoing several changes. There was no change in terms of height, but his muscles were swiftly enlarging, eventually growing to twofold of its original size.<br>The blood-red aura began blazing up, swiftly overwhelming the original black aura that an Asura World Spirit would have. At this very moment, he looked much stronger than he was before.<br>&ldquo;A mere Asura Blood Tribe dares to claim itself to be the strongest tribe? Are you looking down on the Asura Spirit World here? Looks like you need to be taught a lesson.&rdquo;<br>Milady Queen reined in her smile.<br>She usually had a pure and amicable look which made the world blossom when she smiled. However, when she reined in her smile and became serious, her terrifying presence could instill fear in the hearts of any.<br>If she was an inviolable fairy a moment ago, at this very moment, she was like a queen who had walked straight out of hell!<br>Boom!<br>She began releasing a huge amount of black aura from her body.<br>The black aura diverged into two paths. One of them coiled around Chu Feng and Yu Sha and pushed them to the edge of the dueling ring, protecting them. The other charged forth at the enemy with ferocious momentum. Innumerable silhouettes could be seen flitting within the black aura, letting loose piercing cries that gripped at one&rsquo;s soul.<br>It was almost as if the black aura had come from hell itself, rearing millions of vengeful spirits.<br>And this was the attack that was headed straight for the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit.<br>&ldquo;A mere show.&rdquo;<br>Faced with Milady Queen&rsquo;s attack, the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit showed no fear at all. Without resorting to any means, he simply stepped forth and charged toward the incoming black aura.<br>As the two of them came into contact, the vengeful spirits within the black aura began to encircle the world spirit as if soldiers whittling down an enemy.<br>However, all it took was a mere flick of the world spirit&rsquo;s sleeve, and tragic screams filled the air.<br>With his bare hands, the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit actually tore the incoming vengeful spirits into shreds.<br>If Milady Queen was the general commanding thousands of warriors, the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit was like a ferocious berserker dominating the battlefield.<br>In this battle, it would appear that the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit had claimed the upper hand.<br>Milady Queen&rsquo;s overwhelming outpour of black aura was frightening, but it couldn&rsquo;t deal any damage to the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit. The latter&rsquo;s physical body was simply too resilient that it couldn&rsquo;t be harmed easily.<br>He was like an obstinate bull, enduring the force of the black aura to charge ahead, gradually approaching Milady Queen.<br>&ldquo;This woman is formidable, but it looks like the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit is still more powerful!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit was about to reach Milady Queen, the crowd on the spectator stand began cheering excitedly once more.<br>&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo;<br>It was then that MIlady Queen suddenly harrumphed softly before raising her palm to strike outward.<br>Woooosh!<br>The black aura she emanated visibly grew stronger, forcefully pushing the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit backward.<br>&ldquo;You darned harlot, I haven&rsquo;t used my full strength yet!&rdquo;<br>The Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit roared furiously, and his muscles actually grew even larger. Slowly, from getting pushed back by the black aura, he started to gain sufficient strength to stand his ground. Then, the sight from earlier unfolded once more.<br>He braved through the onslaught of vengeful spirits, relying solely on his nearly indestructible body, to continue charging toward Milady Queen.<br>Even though his speed was clearly much slower this time around, he was still making progress a step at a time.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, if it&rsquo;s too much, retreat right away. Victory doesn&rsquo;t matter here. I just need you to be safe.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the circumstances weren&rsquo;t advantageous to them, Chu Feng hurriedly sent a voice transmission to Eggy to advise her.<br>He knew just how obstinate Milady Queen could be, and that made him worried that she would push herself too far in order to help him win this battle.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what nonsense are you spouting? Would I need to back down in the face of such small fry? Just stand there quietly and watch how I clear the trash.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words brought out the criticism of Milady Queen. While it wasn&rsquo;t an actual scolding, it did make her resolution clear to him.<br>Woosh!<br>Once again, the black aura exerted by Milady Queen grew even more horrifying. The cries of agony from the vengeful spirits was blood-curdling, leaving the crowd&rsquo;s hair standing on end.<br>They couldn&rsquo;t help but feel deeply uneasy.<br>The reason behind this phenomenon was because Milady Queen had begun channeling the black aura with both of her hands, resulting in the further enhancement of its prowess. Even the flitting silhouettes within the black aura had become clearer too.<br>If the silhouettes were just vengeful spirits a moment ago, they resembled more like demons now. Every single one of them was tall and strong, and their fangs were long and sharp. Even their hands and legs had morphed into sharp claws.<br>Faced with the onslaught of such a powerful army, even the Asura Blood Tribe&rsquo;s world spirit found it hard to stand his ground.<br></p></div>
