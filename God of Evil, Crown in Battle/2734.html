        <div> - Special Significance<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Senior, it&rsquo;s not that this Chu Feng is deliberately concealing this matter from you. Merely&hellip; this matter is something that I cannot tell you about,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re acting this mysterious, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly be Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s successor, right?&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said with a beaming smile. Merely, that smile of his was very strange.<br>&ldquo;If I said I was, would senior believe me?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile of his own.<br>&ldquo;I would. Why wouldn&rsquo;t I? Even if you are to tell me that you&rsquo;re Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, this old man would believe you too,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique is something that only two people have managed to learn in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The first person was Chu Hanxian, and the second was Chu Xuanyuan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, Chu Xuanyuan had a child. That child&rsquo;s name was precisely Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>When the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said those words, his gaze turned sharp. He was staring at Chu Feng the entire time, watching his each and every movement, seemingly waiting for Chu Feng to make a mistake or give him the answer he wanted.<br>&ldquo;There are coincidences to everything. Perhaps I am merely a coincidence,&rdquo; Chu Feng answered very calmly.<br>Actually, he had thought about whether or not to inform the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master that he was Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son.<br>He was able to tell that the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master seemed to possess an extraordinary sort of feeling toward his father.<br>If he were to know that he was Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master might offer him protection even though he had refused to join the Immortal Armament Villa.<br>However, Chu Feng did not wish to use his father&rsquo;s name to protect himself. Thus, he did not tell him the truth.<br>&ldquo;Coincidence. It is most definitely a coincidence. After all, Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son has long since died.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son were still alive, then he should be about your age,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master measured Chu Feng with his hand.<br>&ldquo;That is truly a remarkable coincidence, then,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled faintly.<br>Then, Chu Feng and the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master chatted about a lot of things. From their conversation, Chu Feng managed to gain an indirect understanding of the situation in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>He had obtained a great harvest of information.<br>As for the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master, he had wanted to understand more about Chu Feng. Unfortunately&hellip; all of his questions were dodged by Chu Feng.<br>Fortunately, the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master was a very tactful person. Seeing that Chu Feng did not wish to tell him, he did not continue to ask either.<br>After chatting for several hours, Chu Feng gave the excuse of having an important matter to attend to and took his leave.<br>For the sake of protecting Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety, the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master personally saw Chu Feng and Song Xi off to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Teleportation Formation.<br>Accompanying the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master to see Chu Feng and Song Xi off was that red-haired old man, that so-called Elder Tuoba.<br>After Chu Feng left, the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master turned to Elder Tuoba. His expression was slightly serious. Evidently, he did not desire to lose an Immortal Armament.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Didn&rsquo;t we already order people to go to the Immortal Armament Armory to control the Immortal Armaments so that they did not react? Why did the Darkstone Dagger still resonate with Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Villa Master, I have already inquired about this matter. The elders in charge of guarding the Immortal Armament Armory all acted according to your orders. Merely&hellip; they were still unable to control the Darkstone Dagger.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If anything, that Chu Feng is simply too amazing. If it wasn&rsquo;t for that fact that you ordered the Immortal Armament Armory&rsquo;s elders to control the Immortal Armaments before Chu Feng entered the second level, our Immortal Armament Villa&hellip; would likely have suffered even more disastrously today,&rdquo; Elder Tuoba said.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that if I didn&rsquo;t secretly order the suppression of the Immortal Armaments, there would definitely be more than a single Immortal Armament to resonate with Chu Feng.&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>Elder Tuoba did not answer immediately. He took a deep breath, and then said, &ldquo;If the elders of the Immortal Armament Armory didn&rsquo;t suppress the Immortal Armaments, likely, not only would all of the Incomplete Immortal Armaments on the first level have resonated with Chu Feng, but all of the Immortal Armaments on the second level would have as well.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master was startled upon hearing those words. He was surprised. Not even he had anticipated this.<br>However, soon, a smile emerged on his face. He said, &ldquo;In that case, that Chu Feng is even more powerful than I originally anticipated him to be.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Villa Master, what do you mean by that?&rdquo; Elder Tuoba asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;Originally, I had thought Chu Feng to be a genius from another Upper Realm&rsquo;s Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, he instead told me that he&rsquo;s not from the Upper Realms,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>&ldquo;Then where is Chu Feng from?&rdquo; Elder Tuoba asked.<br>&ldquo;Do you still remember the name of Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Elder Tuoba answered. However, once he said those words, his expression immediately changed enormously.<br>Then, he said, &ldquo;That Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t possibly be Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, didn&rsquo;t rumor have it that Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son has long since died?&rdquo; Elder Tuoba said.<br>&ldquo;That is merely a rumor. Have either you or I witnessed the corpse of Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son? Have we witnessed how he died?&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Elder Tuoba shook his head.<br>Although they were people with some status in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they were not qualified enough to participate in what had happened back then.<br>After all, the participants in that occasion back then were all grand characters from various Upper Realms and Starfields.<br>&ldquo;None of us have witnessed how Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son died. We have merely heard of it through rumors.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, we have personally witnessed Chu Feng&rsquo;s Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng has trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, is surnamed Chu and is not a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan. Yet, he dared to treat the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations in such a manner, it was as if there was an enormous hatred between them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All of these indications only point to Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! If he is really Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, will he become as powerful as Chu Xuanyuan was?!&rdquo; Elder Tuoba spoke very emotionally.<br>&ldquo;Chu Xuanyuan is a mountain of a man. Likely, no one in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm would be able to surpass him. Not even his son will be capable of it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if Chu Feng really is Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, his future accomplishments are most definitely not something that the other Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s younger generations can compare to.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as he continues to grow, he will definitely become the strongest expert in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Villa Master, with such a good sapling, why didn&rsquo;t you have him join our Immortal Armament Villa?&rdquo; Elder Tuoba asked.<br>&ldquo;Did you think that I didn&rsquo;t want him to join? This old man was refused,&rdquo; the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master cast a side eye at Elder Tuoba.<br>&ldquo;In that case, should we secretly protect Chu Feng? We can&rsquo;t just give up like this, no?&rdquo; Elder Tuoba said.<br>&ldquo;If he really is Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, would there be a need for our protection?&rdquo; The Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s villa Master asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. However, even if we do not protect him, we should express ourselves, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We should take advantage of the fact that he has yet to mature to close our relationship with him, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we had known that he was Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, we wouldn&rsquo;t have secretly rigged the Immortal Armament Armory. After all, the best Immortal Armaments in our Immortal Armament Villa are not in the Immortal Armament Armory.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, this Elder Tuoba was actually complaining about the strategic decision made by the Immortal Armament Villa&rsquo;s Villa Master.<br>The reason for that was because he felt that they had missed a great opportunity.<br>If Chu Feng was a genius from another Upper Realm, he would not have acted this way.<br>However, if Chu Feng was Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, then he felt that anything would be worth it.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Xuanyuan possessed a special sort of significance to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br><br><br></p></div>
