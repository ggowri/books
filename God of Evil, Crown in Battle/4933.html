        <h1>Chapter 4932</h1>
        <div>: Rank Four Dragon Transformation Sensation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never thought of taking her life. I wasn&rsquo;t able to fight against my father&rsquo;s obstinacy, which eventually resulted in this situation. I thought that since Miaomiao has already fused into my soul, I&rsquo;ll use her soul energy to sustain my life for the time being. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ll try to look for other means to cure my affliction.<br>&ldquo;As soon as I find a cure, I&rsquo;ll have Master Yin Ren extract Miaomiao from my soul and return her freedom,&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao said.<br>&ldquo;What if you can&rsquo;t find a cure? Are you going to keep her in your soul until her soul completely fuses with yours?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Princess Xiaoxiao didn&rsquo;t say a word. Instead, she handed over the container storing Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s body to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Master Yin Ren has a way to extract Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s soul from my body. My illness has nothing to do with her. I&rsquo;ll cooperate with you if you wish to return her freedom,&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao said.<br>Chu Feng took the container. Instead of storing it into his Cosmos Sack, he kept it with him.<br>&ldquo;As long as Miaomiao is fine, I&rsquo;ll find a way to treat you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Thanks for that,&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao replied with a slight bow.<br>It was just that her bow felt a little foreign. Chu Feng knew that she must be feeling horrible at the moment.<br>If she was truly protecting Xian Miaomiao because of him, that would mean that she harbored feelings for him. Yet, Chu Feng chose to prioritize Xian Miaomiao above her.<br>There was no one who could feel good about that.<br>Kacha!<br>Kacha!<br>Cracks suddenly appeared on the compass.<br>&ldquo;Come over here!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng quickly pulled Princess Xiaoxiao over to his side and protected her using the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk too.<br>Boom!<br>The compass finally shattered. The spirit power that the compass had absorbed thus far was released, and it immediately surged toward the two of them with even greater intensity than before.<br>It was fortunate that Chu Feng had the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk with him, or else the two of them would have been in grave danger.<br>&ldquo;How could this happen?&rdquo;<br>Princess Xiaoxiao was flustered.<br>&ldquo;Did Master Yin Ren impart to you any other way of taming the spirit power here other than using the formation on the compass?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else. Sorry, Chu Feng. I&rsquo;ve landed you in this plight,&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao said with reddened eyes.<br>She felt that it was only a matter of time before they lost their lives here. If not for her, Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t have ended up getting trapped here.<br>Chu Feng knew that Princess Xiaoxiao wasn&rsquo;t a weak-willed individual. She was only getting so pessimistic and self-reproachful because she knew how dangerous this place was.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll entrust this to you for the time being. Stay in there and don&rsquo;t move around.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng passed the container storing Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s body back to Princess Xiaoxiao before preparing to head out of the barrier.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what are you doing? You can&rsquo;t go out! The spirit power here is extremely violent. It&rsquo;ll take your life!&rdquo;<br>Princess Xiaoxiao grabbed Chu Feng&rsquo;s arm to stop him.<br>&ldquo;Based on what I saw, those who seek to take away this stone will need to earn its acknowledgment. The only way to do so is to withstand its spirit power. The compass&rsquo; formation could have done the job too if it was strong enough, but clearly, it wasn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no other choice now.<br>&ldquo;Between the two of us, I&rsquo;m far more suited to attempt it.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng shook off Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s arm and walked out.<br>Without the protection of the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk, spirit power gushed furiously into his body. He gritted his teeth and tried to hold on, but his face swiftly warped in pain.<br>His skin started to dissolve, and his blood and flesh began to vaporize.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng!!!&rdquo;<br>Princess Xiaoxiao wanted to rush out of the barrier to save him.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move! No matter what, you mustn&rsquo;t come out!&rdquo; Chu Feng bellowed.<br>&ldquo;Come back! You&rsquo;ll die at this rate!&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao advised.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other way. This is our only shot at escaping from here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>It was just that withstanding the stone&rsquo;s spirit power was no easy feat. His body was getting tattered, and even his mind was being devastated as well. Within moments, he looked like he already had a leg in the grave.<br>He could sense himself reaching a critical state. His consciousness started to blur.<br>If he couldn&rsquo;t gain the acknowledgment of the stone soon, he might really die here.<br>Knowing that he was approaching his limits, he attempted to make his way back into the barrier erected by the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk to heal up first before figuring out the next plan, but to his astonishment, his body was far too weak to move.<br>To make things worse, he didn&rsquo;t have the strength to talk either. He couldn&rsquo;t even tell Princess Xiaoxiao to drag him back.<br>&ldquo;Am I really going to die here?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt his consciousness swiftly fading as death encroached on him.<br>As for Princess Xiaoxiao, tears flowed from her eyes as she watched as Chu Feng was reduced to a mere skeleton. Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t have to go through all of this if not for her. At this rate, he could really lose his life.<br>She wanted to save Chu Feng, but she knew what Chu Feng said was the truth too. That was why she was holding herself back.<br>Who could have known that what Chu Feng had said earlier ended up sabotaging himself?<br>&ldquo;This is too dangerous! You&rsquo;re putting your life on the line here! Chu Feng, are you certain about this?&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao shouted.<br>She could sense that Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura was getting weaker.<br>&ldquo;Forget it!&rdquo;<br>In the end, Princess Xiaoxiao hardened her resolve prepared herself to rush out and pull Chu Feng back.<br>Whoosh!<br>A furious roar suddenly resounded from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. An aura gushed out from within him, instantaneously devouring the world around him.<br>The spirit power immediately halted their aggression in the face of the aura. They stood on the spot, fearfully twisting and turning around as if they were shivering.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br>Princess Xiaoxiao felt deeply intimidated by the aura. She could feel a pressure crushing down on her soul.<br>It was as if a conqueror had descended upon the world, commanding the masses with its indomitable air. There was no one who would dare to raise their heads in its presence!<br>It wasn&rsquo;t martial power but spirit power.<br>&ldquo;This feeling&hellip; Is that Chu Feng&rsquo;s World Spiritist Bloodline? His World Spiritist Bloodline is this powerful?&rdquo;<br>Princess Xiaoxiao looked at Chu Feng with a mixture of shock and fear.<br>As a world spiritist herself, she could tell just how terrifying the spirit power pouring out from Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was.<br>Grar!<br>There was another furious roar, and the spirit power began seeping back into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. As soon as the spirit power retreated, the surrounding spirit power coming from the stone rushed at Chu Feng yet again.<br>But there was a slight difference this time around. The spirit power was no longer violent but gentle. Not only did it not further injure Chu Feng, but it even regenerated his body.<br>His body soon recovered back to normal, and his eyes fluttered open.<br>Following that, a surge of spirit power suddenly enveloped Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s body, and by the time she knew it, she had already returned back to the palace. Chu Feng flew out from the stone right after her.<br>The moment Chu Feng landed on the ground, the stone that was embedded on the throne quickly flew into Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>&ldquo;Looks like it&rsquo;s a success,&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao said.<br>&ldquo;This stone is truly formidable.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked at the stone with an excited smile. He could sense the changes within his body.<br>His spirit power had grown much stronger. In fact, he had just advanced to rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>Weng!<br>A spirit formation gate suddenly appeared before them. It was opened by Princess Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s leave this place,&rdquo; she said.<br>Now that the stone was already in their possession, she wanted to leave this dangerous land as soon as possible.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment. Will we be able to see the habitat of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s race if we open that door?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Beyond that door is the world where the Ancient Era&rsquo;s race lives,&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao replied.<br>&ldquo;Since we&rsquo;re already here, why don&rsquo;t we head over to take a look?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng walked up to the door as he said those words. Before Princess Xiaoxiao could attempt to dissuade him, he had already opened the door.<br>The scenery that unfolded before his eyes left both him and Princess Xiaoxiao shocked.<br>There were innumerable gigantic beasts that stood at over a thousand meters tall. They had terrifying faces that shared the characteristics of a human and a beast, and their bodies gave off the aura of the Ancient Era.<br>The tallest of them appeared to be tens of thousands of meters tall. If it were to stand upright, even the clouds would be beneath its body.<br>There were countless of them in the world beyond the door, reminiscent of a meandering mountain range.<br>Yet, they were all lying on the floor. A powerful blood stench suffused the air.<br>There were literal rivers of blood right before them.<br>All of the beings from the Ancient Era had been slaughtered. The rivers of blood were flowing from their bodies. Their carcasses were stacked like mountains.<br>It was as if doomsday had arrived!<br></p></div>
