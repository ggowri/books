        <div>: Oppressing the Weak But Fearing the Strong<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a formation embedded into the mountain that triggered when we landed, forcing me to reveal myself. I didn&rsquo;t notice it at all. It seems like the monastery owner is truly a man of great capabilities,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>His concealment formation coupled with the power of the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was so strong that even world spiritists of Situ Tingye&rsquo;s caliber were unable to sense him at all. Yet, the formation on the mountain instantaneously forced him to reveal himself.<br>This showed just how powerful the world spiritist behind the formation was.<br>Furthermore, the formation only showed itself for the briefest of instant, swiftly receding back into the mountain after breaking Chu Feng&rsquo;s concealment formation. Even so, Chu Feng could still tell that the formation had been constructed not too long ago, further hinting that it was the doing of the monastery owner.<br>&ldquo;The Totem Galaxy is filled with many hidden experts!&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked.<br>He didn&rsquo;t expect there to be such a formidable figure in a Lower Realm.<br>Putting all things aside, the monastery master&rsquo;s spirit power was likely to be above that of Situ Tingye and Bai Yunqing. It would be unwise to underestimate him.<br>&ldquo;The Totem Galaxy is indeed filled with many hidden experts. We&rsquo;ll have to keep a low profile and tread carefully,&rdquo; City Lord Liang said via voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.<br>Those in the queue had already seen his true appearance right after he landed on the mountain, so he decided to just openly accompany City Lord Liang into the monastery to purchase the ingredients.<br>City Lord Liang&rsquo;s disguise wasn&rsquo;t dispelled whereas Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t mind others seeing his appearance. It was not as if he had any family or friends here anyway, so he didn&rsquo;t have to worry about implicating them.<br>He got into the queue together with City Lord Liang.<br>In front of them in the queue were twelve young men and women. Despite their youthful appearances, none of them were juniors anymore. They had simply chosen to maintain their youthful appearances.<br>That being said, Chu Feng could tell that they were in their hundreds, which was fairly young in the world of cultivation. It was only normal for them to adopt a youthful appearance.<br>Chu Feng took a quick scan and saw that they were all dressed in blue robes, leading him to deduce that they were from the same sect. His curiosity was piqued when his eyes fell on the tokens hanging by their waists.<br>Those tokens were usually inscribed with the sect name, but theirs were surprisingly empty. Rather than them trying to conceal their affiliation, it would be more accurate to say that the tokens were empty from the very start.<br>&ldquo;Their sect looks pretty interesting.&rdquo;<br>This was the first time Chu Feng saw a sect with an empty sect token.<br>What was worth mentioning was that while Chu Feng was assessing them, one of the more beautiful women in the group was also assessing Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Junior, why are you looking at him?&rdquo; a dashing male disciple of the group asked the beautiful woman.<br>His voice was filled with jealousy, and he even threw Chu Feng a dirty look.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just casually looking around,&rdquo; the beautiful woman replied before turning her sight back to the monastery.<br>Things should have ended there, but the dashing male disciple refused to let the matter slip. He continued glaring at Chu Feng with provocative eyes.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only to be expected. How could the ravishing fairy of our sect possibly be interested in someone who looks as normal as him? A toad lusting over a swan; he&rsquo;s dreaming if he thinks that he can get together with my junior!&rdquo; the dashing male disciple sneered.<br>&ldquo;Brat, who are you saying is a toad?&rdquo;<br>Before Chu Feng could act up, City Lord Liang had already started bellowing at the dashing male disciple. However, his furious outburst failed to intimidate the dashing male disciple.<br>The dashing male disciple pointed his finger at Chu Feng and mocked, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying that he&rsquo;s a toad. What about it? The two of you should know your place! Even esteemed elders would quietly queue up and purchase their ingredients without kicking up a fuss, but he caused such a huge commotion upon his arrival. Not only that, he kept ogling at my junior too. Why else would he do that if not to catch my junior&rsquo;s attention? See, is there anything wrong with what I said?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, stop it. He didn&rsquo;t do anything to me,&rdquo; the beautiful woman quickly spoke up.<br>The other disciples also tried to calm down the dashing male disciple.<br>&ldquo;City Lord Liang, didn&rsquo;t you just tell me to keep a low profile?&rdquo; Chu Feng sent a voice transmission over with a smile on his lips.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t angered by the dashing male disciple&rsquo;s words at all. The latter was small fry to him. If he wanted to, he could have erased the dashing male disciple with a mere flick of his finger. He thought that it was a waste of time to lose his temper against an ant.<br>&ldquo;How can I tolerate it when he insults young master Chu Feng? Who does he think he is?&rdquo;<br>However, City Lord Liang soon noticed Chu Feng&rsquo;s smile and asked in confusion,&rdquo; Young master Chu Feng, aren&rsquo;t you angry at all?&rdquo;<br>He had always thought that Chu Feng was a cruel and hot-tempered person, especially after seeing how he treated the Situ World Spiritist Clansmen. The gory massacre he had witnessed would likely haunt him for many nights to come.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not worth getting angry over such people. I&rsquo;m turning a blind eye to it out of respect for the monastery owner. After all, we&rsquo;re here to purchase ingredients. If I really wish to teach him a lesson, it&rsquo;s not too late to do so afterward,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;I see. I was too rash.&rdquo;<br>City Lord Liang nodded in agreement.<br>Acquiring the ingredients was their priority at the moment. If they crossed blows here and angered the monastery owner, they might fail to acquire the ingredients they require. The one who would suffer as a result of their actions would be Lord Yuwei.<br>City Lord Liang decided to rein in his anger, but the dashing male disciple only grew increasingly arrogant.<br>He directed a provocative glance at Chu Feng and City Lord Liang before turning to his fellow sect members, saying, &ldquo;Those two cowards. I have seen far too many people like them. They only know how to put on an act. You need to put them in place so that they wouldn&rsquo;t dare to mess around. Look, they have become much more obedient after I taught them a lesson. If not for my junior, I would have surely given them a good walloping!&rdquo;<br>Those words were spoken in glee, almost as if he had already taught Chu Feng and City Lord Liang a lesson. That brought a smile onto Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, there is no lack of cowards who only dare to oppress the weak all over the world of cultivation.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng initially thought little of the dashing male disciple&rsquo;s taunts, but those words made him determined to teach the latter a lesson.<br></p></div>
