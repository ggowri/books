        <div>: Change in Situation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not too long later, Shengguang Haoxuan and Shengguang Xintian stepped out the golden spirit formation gates too.<br>The two of them seemed to be in good condition. It looked like the trial in the golden formation gate was just a little laborious but nothing dangerous.<br>Weng!<br>After all of them were finally out, the hundred spirit formation gates began sinking into the ground with a buzzing sound. However, in their place rose a brand new spirit formation gate at the center of the palace.<br>This newly arisen spirit formation gate was much larger than the others, and the aura it emanated was much more domineering too.<br>Its appearance signaled the commencement of the third trial.<br>However, the crowd didn&rsquo;t dare to move carelessly, choosing to turn their gazes onto Chu Feng instead. They weren&rsquo;t sure where the spirit formation gate led to, but their gut feeling told them that Chu Feng had the answer to that question.<br>After all, Chu Feng had received the instructions regarding this cultivation realm.<br>&ldquo;It started with cleansing, followed by a trial, and it&rsquo;ll end with a stroke of fortune. I&rsquo;m sure all of you have some idea what fortune refers to. It&rsquo;s something that can&rsquo;t be seen or touched, but once it arrives, good things are bound to happen.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that the fortune in this location is slightly different than usual. It&rsquo;s bestowed upon us by this cultivation realm, so we&rsquo;re able to capture it with our own hands.<br>&ldquo;Close your eyes and sense your surroundings. Feel the atypical aura hidden around you. That&rsquo;s the fortune this cultivation realm has to offer you. The more you can comprehend from it, the greater you&rsquo;ll benefit.<br>&ldquo;I can tell you all forthright that the cleansing and the trial are nothing more than the appetizers. The ultimate treasure is the fortune this place has to offer. If you are able to bring those three elements together, you&rsquo;ll find something good seeping into your minds and bodies. Perhaps, it might just bring you unexpectedly good results when you cultivate,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>The crowd quickly sat on the ground and closed their eyes. They formed a series of hand seals and tried their best to perceive the surroundings in search of the &lsquo;fortune&rsquo; Chu Feng spoke of.<br>Even Shengguang Haoxuan did the same too. They wouldn&rsquo;t want to miss this precious opportunity.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you lying to us again?&rdquo;<br>However, Shengguang Menglai suddenly rose to her feet and glared at Chu Feng with sharp eyes.<br>Everyone quickly opened their eyes upon hearing those words and looked at Chu Feng. They trusted Shengguang Menglai&rsquo;s judgment more than Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>However, there was one exception: Shengguang Xintian.<br>&ldquo;Big sister Menglai, what are you saying? Why would Chu Feng lie to us?&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian asked.<br>&ldquo;Xintian, I need you to keep quiet for now.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Menglai didn&rsquo;t even look at Shengguang Xintian when she said those words, and her tone was chilly too. Shengguang Xintian stiffened at her cold attitude, but she chose to hold her tongue in the end.<br>&ldquo;Miss Menglai, care to elaborate?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in confusion.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s indeed fortune lingering in this hall, but it&rsquo;ll be hard to gather a substantial amount of fortune through sensing and capturing it. There&rsquo;s obviously a much better way to do it, but why are you withholding the information?&rdquo; Shengguang Menglai questioned.<br>&ldquo;How do you know that there&rsquo;s a better way to do it?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you liar! If you knew that there&rsquo;s a better way to do it, why aren&rsquo;t you telling us? Are you trying to monopolize the fortune here?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Haoxuan was the first one to hop onto the bandwagon and speak up against Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, is there really a better way to do it?&rdquo; Shengguang Chuyao asked.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s indeed a better way, but it&rsquo;s extremely dangerous. I don&rsquo;t recommend you to try it. Our bodies have already undergone changes from earlier cleansing and trial, so you should be able to easily sense and gather fortune by focusing. It&rsquo;d suffice for you to use the method I told you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, you could have just shared the other method with us. We can decide for ourselves whether we should use it or not,&rdquo; Shengguang Chuyao replied.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Brother Chuyao is absolutely right! Young master Chu Feng, you should just tell us the alternative method too!&rdquo;<br>The crowd chirped in.<br>Instead of answering the crowd, Chu Feng turned to Shengguang Menglai and asked curiously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite curious how Miss Menglai knows that there&rsquo;s another way to capture the fortune here. I should be the only one who knows about it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sharp-witted man, young master Chu Feng, but it looks like you slip up at times too. Have you not noticed that the energy you have obtained from this cultivation realm is gradually receding?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Menglai flicked her sleeves and revealed a jewel strapped to her wrist. The jewel resembled a fruit, but the aura it emanated was identical to that of the Holy Lotus Tree.<br>&ldquo;T-that is&hellip; Holy Lotus Stone! Menglai actually managed to control it!&rdquo;<br>The juniors of the Holy Valley were overjoyed to see that treasure.<br>Weng!<br>The next moment, the jewel emanated a burst of bizarre light. It transformed the tremendous energy harnessed within Chu Feng&rsquo;s body into streams of light, which then flowed into the jewel.<br>&ldquo;I was still wondering why my energy has been growing weaker all this while. I thought that it was time-limited, but it turned out that you were pulling some tricks behind my back,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked in realization.<br>He had long noticed that the energy in his body was slowly receding, just that he wasn&rsquo;t able to confirm the cause of it.<br>&ldquo;Of course, there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;d have allowed you to find out about it. Young master Chu Feng, you shouldn&rsquo;t blame me for this. No matter what, we&rsquo;re in the Holy Valley right now. I can&rsquo;t allow an outsider like you to govern our fates,&rdquo; Shengguang Menglai said.<br>&ldquo;Your words make perfect sense, Miss Menglai. I might have considered voluntarily transferring the energy to you if you had chosen to take a more peaceful approach, but your clandestine movements leave me with no choice but to doubt your intention. You shouldn&rsquo;t blame me for taking protective measures too then,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re no more than trash without the energy from the cultivation realm! Any single one of us can easily trample you to death. How dare you speak so arrogantly in front of us?&rdquo; Shengguang Haoxuan bellowed furiously.<br>&ldquo;Shut your mouth, Shengguang Haoxuan! How could we have proceeded so smoothly in the cultivation realm if not for young master Chu Feng&rsquo;s help?&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian bellowed.<br>Weng!<br>A gush of energy suddenly shrouded Shengguang Xintian, sealing off her movements like a cage.<br>&ldquo;Big sister Menglai, what are you doing?&rdquo; Shengguang Xintian asked.<br>However, Shengguang Menglai didn&rsquo;t respond to Shengguang Xintian&rsquo;s question. Instead, she continued eyeing Chu Feng intently.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, regardless of your reasoning, it&rsquo;s a fact that you have injured a member of our Holy Valley earlier. As a member of the Holy Valley myself, I&rsquo;m obliged to redress their grievances.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Menglai turned to Shengguang Haoxuan and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill him. It&rsquo;ll suffice to teach him a lesson.&rdquo;<br>Everyone immediately understood the meaning behind her words. She was giving Shengguang Haoxuan an opportunity to exact vengeance!<br></p></div>
