        <h1>Chapter 3863</h1>
        <div> - Strange Matter<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. This place is indeed extremely remarkable. Even though it appears to be very plain, dangers actually lurk everywhere.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the past, there was someone that felt that since the treasures of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb were all hidden inside the mountain range, he would be able to obtain the treasures should he excavate the entire mountain range.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, that person directly attacked the mountain range with the intention of destroying it, and excavating the entire region.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, before his attacks could even reach the mountain range, they disappeared into thin air. They had all been engulfed by the invisible spirit formation around the mountain range.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not only did he fail to cut open the mountains, he failed to even damage a single blade of grass on the mountain range.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Seeing that, the crowd all exclaimed in admiration at how powerful that protective formation was. After all, the person who had attacked the mountain range was no ordinary individual. He was a peak Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To the crowd&rsquo;s surprise, things were not that simple at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After failing to successfully cut open the mountains, that peak Exalted-level expert planned to leave. However, right when he was doing that, he suddenly started screaming miserably. Then, with blood covering his entire body, he fell from the sky.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After that scene occurred, the crowd were both shocked and terrified.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Before that peak Exalted was injured, the crowd did not sense any oppressive might at all. Furthermore, no one saw anyone attacking that peak Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Just like that, without any reason at all, that peak Exalted was seriously injured.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What was more astonishing was that the crowd noticed that that peak Exalted&rsquo;s injury fully appeared to be caused by the attack he had used to attack the mountain range earlier.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In other words, the attack he had unleashed at the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb had ultimately returned landed on himself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, it happened in a completely undetected manner," said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such a strange occurrence?&rdquo; A startled look appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;Strange? That wouldn&rsquo;t be considered to be strange yet. Strangest of all&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After that peak Exalted returned home, he suddenly went mad, and personally massacred his entire clan&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After that, he committed suicide&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, after being seriously injured, he was on the verge of death, and unable to even stand. Thus, how could he possibly be able to massacre his entire clan?&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;In that case, it would mean that if one were to attack the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb, not only would one be punished, but one&rsquo;s relatives would also be implicated by their actions?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That is precisely the case,&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;In that case, has no one attempted to attack the Great Monstrous Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb after that incident?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Of course there are. What this world lacks the most are people that do not believe in superstitions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After that person, there were many experts that attempted to attack the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, without any exception, they were all injured by their own attacks. Then, they suddenly went mad, and personally massacred their families. After killing all of them, they then took their own lives.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, the manner in which they killed themselves was very strange. They ate themselves alive by the mouthful&hellip;&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Ssss~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That truly is strange&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s brows narrowed, and he sucked in a mouthful of cold air.<br>The occurrence of such strange matters was no longer something that could be explained by whether or not a protective formation was powerful.<br>If a spirit formation was powerful, it would be able to block attacks, and turn the tomb into an impregnable fortress that no one could approach.<br>However, the mountain range had many creatures living in it. It had even formed an entire ecosystem.<br>There were even ferocious beasts in the mountain range. Furthermore, those ferocious beasts were not weak either.<br>Logically, the creatures should also be considered as intruders. Yet, those strange occurrences did not happen to them.<br>When observing it from the angle of a spirit formation, the spirit formation&rsquo;s strength seemed to be identical.<br>It should be impossible for other creatures to be unaffected by the spirit formation inside the mountain range.<br>However, if martial cultivators were to attack the mountain range, they would suffer from a strange incident.<br>From that, Chu Feng suspected that the mountain range likely did not only contain an extremely powerful protective formation.<br>Likely, there was another sort of power present.<br>As for that other sort of power, it would be curse power.<br>Chu Feng suspected that those people that had attacked the mountain range had all been cursed by it.<br>That was why they ended up massacring their entire clan or family, and then eating themselves alive. That was why they ended up committing such irrational acts.<br>That said, if that was truly a curse, it would mean that the curse was extremely powerful.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng once again used his eyes to carefully examine the mountain range.<br>This time around, he examined the mountain range for a particularly long time.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, you&rsquo;ve been examining it for six hours already. Did you manage to determine anything?&rdquo; the Eleventh of the Mystic Cave Saints asked after six hours had passed.<br>However, Chu Feng did not answer him.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, the people from the All-heaven Sect could arrive at any moment. Even if you plan to examine the mountain range, we should find somewhere hidden to examine it, no?&rdquo; said the Eleventh of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Eleventh, don&rsquo;t disturb brother Asura for the time being. He must be earnestly examining things. Your actions will affect his observation,&rdquo; said the Second Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;But it wouldn&rsquo;t do for us to continue to be exposed like this, no? If others are to discover that we&rsquo;re here, things will be very bad for us," said the Eleventh of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;In that case, let&rsquo;s set up a concealing formation and hide ourselves first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait till brother Asura finishes his examining before leaving," said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints. As he spoke, he released his spirit power with the intention of setting up a concealing formation.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that," right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly spoke.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had finally spoken, and had retrieved his eyes from the mountain range, the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints hurriedly asked, &ldquo;Brother Asura, did you manage to make out anything this time around?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;One cannot forcibly attack that mountain range. The mountain range not only contains a complete and powerful protective formation, but it might also contain a hidden curse. The people you spoke of earlier were most likely not injured by the mountain range&rsquo;s protective formation. Rather, they triggered its curse," said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Curse?&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints were rather surprised.<br>When they looked to the vast mountain range again, there was more restraining fear in their eyes.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, it&rsquo;s a curse. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s an extremely powerful curse,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, in that case, do you have a way to breach it?&rdquo; asked the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;I do not." Chu Feng shook his head.<br>&ldquo;What are we to do now?&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints all felt very distressed.<br>They had decided to travel there ahead of time because they wanted to enter the Tomb before the people from the All-heaven Sect arrived.<br>However, judging from the current situation, they could only continue according to their original plan.<br>Their original plan was to wait for the arrival of the All-heaven Sect and, once they finished using their methods and treasures to open the tomb, sneak their way inside.<br>However, that plan would put them in a much more passive situation.<br></p></div>
