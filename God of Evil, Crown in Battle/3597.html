        <div> - The Tenth Ranking Divine Body<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng became extremely furious upon hearing that. He was so furious that his veins all stood out.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be s-so-so an-an-angry just yet. If y-you&rsquo;re a-angry with just that, y-you will fin-find what I&rsquo;m a-about to tell you to be e-even harder to accept,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Chu Feng frowned even deeper. He felt that the situation seemed to be even more serious.<br>&ldquo;N-not only am I t-t-the perfect vessel for t-that old fart, but y-you must a-also help me f-fuse with that old fart,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Impossible! I couldn&rsquo;t possibly do that sort of thing!&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother, y-yo-you must do it,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Wang Qiang, don't reach terms with that Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. Trust me, I will do my best to bring you away from this place. I will definitely not allow you to become that Blood-devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s vessel,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother, y-you re-really don't have to be t-this emotional. H-hear me out first,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Very well, tell me,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You s-should still remember the p-power that I awakened in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, right?&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Of course I do. That power was extremely remarkable,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, it is r-rather remark-markable. My Divine Power is called the Four F-fiends Divine Body. According t-to that old f-fart, there a-are countless Divine Bodies in the world, b-but my Four Fiends Divine Body is r-ranked tenth,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Ranked tenth? As in ranked tenth among all the Divine Powers?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;T-that&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s r-r-r-ranked tenth among a-all the Divine Powers,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng suddenly recalled his father Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s words.<br>His father had coincidentally seen the ranking list for all the Divine Powers. Qin Xuantian&rsquo;s Four Symbols Divine Power was ranked third on the list.<br>Chu Feng had seen the power of Wang Qiang&rsquo;s Divine Body before. It was extremely powerful. It could be said to be one of the most powerful Divine Bodies Chu Feng had ever seen.<br>However, such a powerful Divine Body was actually only ranked tenth, whereas his own Four Symbols Divine Body was ranked third. Chu Feng was unable to keep himself from wondering exactly how strong the true power of the Four Symbols Divine Body was.<br>&ldquo;However, t-the stronger the Divine B-body, the m-m-more difficult it is t-to-to control. That holds even more s-so for my Four Fiends Divine B-body.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am a-able to s-sense how s-strong it i-is. I am simply u-un-unable to unleash its true power,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>Chu Feng gasped with admiration in his heart upon hearing those words. Even the overwhelming power that Wang Qiang had displayed before was not the true power of the Four Fiends Divine Body.<br>That would mean that the Four Fiends Divine Body was even more powerful.<br>This also indirectly showed that his Four Symbols Divine Body was even stronger than he had imagined.<br>&ldquo;Most i-im-importatly of all, s-since I&rsquo;m unable to control my Divine Power, i-if I a-am to continue on like th-this, I will one d-day be devoured by it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although h-having su-such a Divine Power is s-something that others w-would feel envious toward, only I k-know that it&rsquo;s a-a-actually a slow a-and f-fatal poison. Unless I can subdue it, I will o-one day be poisoned t-to death by it,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;In that case, do you have a way to handle it?&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed a worried look upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;I do. The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted c-can help me,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted?&rdquo; Chu Feng narrowed his brows.<br>After hearing what Wang Qiang had said previously, Chu Feng had a very bad impression of the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. He felt that it was nothing more than a demonic being that deprived others of their souls and seized their bodies for its own use.<br>&ldquo;Brother, t-the Blood-devouring D-demon Exalted is not a-as bad as you i-imagine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although it w-will imbue its s-soul into me, it w-will not su-suppress my consciousness.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Look at Qin Kunlun. He n-never c-comitted any atrocities. E-even when he ul-ultimately came to the Void Sacred Tree, it w-was not because he w-was forced by the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted. I-instead, Qin Kunlun d-did so voluntarily.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, if h-he didn&rsquo;t have the Blood-devouring Demon E-exalted&rsquo;s help, Qin Kunlun w-would only be an ordinary person of the younger generation. T-thus, to Qin Kunlun, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was his benefactor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although the B-blood-devouring Demon Exalted is indeed ter-terrifyingly powerful, it's a-also precisely because it is s-so powerful that others l-look fo-forward to it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;A-actually, y-you can v-very well consider the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted to be an e-ex-extremely rare cultivation treasure. Although it needs a vessel t-to sur-survive, its v-vessel will a-also be able to ob-obtain its power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I a-am the p-perfect vessel that it sought, if I a-am able to fuse perfectly with it, the o-one to a-actually benefit from the fusion w-will not be it, b-but ra-rather me instead.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It i-is my for-fortune to be ch-chosen by it, it&rsquo;s a-an enormous blessing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, b-brother, you should not be wo-worrying for me. Instead, y-you should be h-happy for me,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>Chu Feng felt what Wang Qiang said to be reasonable.<br>In the vast world, the countless creatures, plants and vegetation were all living existences. Likewise, Divine Powers were also living existences.<br>It was not only Divine Powers. Many of the powers that martial cultivators obtained were also alive.<br>Even though they did not say anything after entering the bodies of martial cultivators, they were still alive.<br>One example would be the nine enormous lightning beasts within Chu Feng&rsquo;s dantian. Who would dare to say that they weren&rsquo;t alive?<br>One that was even better to visualize would be the little girl that had assimilated into Chu Feng&rsquo;s blood.<br>Not only did she possess extraordinary intelligence, but she also possessed power capable of utter destruction. If she had wanted to, she would be able to completely annihilate Chu Feng in an instant.<br>However, she did not harm Chu Feng. Instead, after testing him, she decided to assimilate with his body.<br>Was there a difference between that little girl and the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted?<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted had directly informed Wang Qiang of its intentions, and would be able to provide him with enormous assistance in martial cultivation.<br>That little girl, on the other hand, did not tell Chu Feng anything. He didn&rsquo;t know what she wanted to do by assimilating into his blood. All he knew was that she was very powerful.<br>Normally, the assimilation of such a powerful existence should provide him with enormous assistance.<br>However, Chu Feng had not felt anything special as of yet. It could be said that he did not manage to gain any benefits from the assimilation.<br>The tests he had endured earlier could be said to have been passed in vain.<br>Judging from this aspect, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted was much more reliable than the little girl.<br>It was as Wang Qiang had said. Being able to become the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s vessel was actually an enormous opportunity.<br>&ldquo;In other words, you&rsquo;re voluntarily allowing yourself to be forcibly instilled with cultivation that leads to your body being damaged?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of c-course it&rsquo;s voluntarily. I&rsquo;m a w-world spiritist, h-ho-how could I not know that instilling c-cultivation will damage one&rsquo;s t-talent?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But b-brother, you d-do not know how powerful t-that old fart is. If I a-am able to fuse with it, the d-damage from having cultivation forcibly i-in-instilled would not amount t-to anything at all. I will o-only obtain even more benefits.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, y-you must help me. Otherwise, I c-can only have t-the trash from the Blood-devouring Demon Clan help me. But, how c-could they be a-as reliable as you? I d-don&rsquo;t trust them,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve mentioned this sooner. You scared me. I&rsquo;d nearly decided to go seek out that Blood-devouring Demon Exalted to fight it with my life.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng rolled his eyes at Wang Qiang.<br>He was not joking around. He was truly frightened by Wang Qiang&rsquo;s words earlier, and had truly thought about using the power of the Evil God Sword and risking his life to kill the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>After learning the truth, Chu Feng realized that he had been overthinking things.<br>This was not Chu Feng&rsquo;s fault. If anything, it was Wang Qiang&rsquo;s fault. Wang Qiang was beating around the bush too much, and made Chu Feng overthink things.<br></p></div>
