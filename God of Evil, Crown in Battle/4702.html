        <h1>Chapter 4701</h1>
        <div>: You&rsquo;re Chu Feng?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Most of them were disciples of the North Tortoise Hall, but there were some elders amongst them who had come over to watch the commotion.<br>Even from a distance away, Chu Feng could already figure out the reason why they were gathered around his residence. That was because a disciple of the East Dragon Hall was currently standing at the entrance of it&mdash;Tu Yuanyuan.<br>Tu Yuanyuan had already changed into the clothes donned by disciples of the East Dragon Hall. Put that together with her beautiful appearance and her unconcealed cultivation, it was no wonder why she would become the limelight.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re finally back!&rdquo;<br>With Tu Yuanyuan&rsquo;s sharp eyes, she swiftly noticed Chu Feng even before he came close. She rose into the air and flew over to his side.<br>&ldquo;So he&rsquo;s Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I heard that his cultivation is already at rank one Utmost Exalted level, and he rejected all of the invitations from the East Dragon Hall&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That fellow is bound to become a notable figure in the future.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder why he&rsquo;s able to win the fancy of a junior from the East Dragon Hall right after joining the sect. Ahhh, I&rsquo;m envious!&rdquo;<br>Discussions broke out amidst the crowd as envious and admiring gazes were directed in Chu Feng&rsquo;s direction. Most of the female disciples were eyeing Chu Feng with deeper intentions in mind, and some of their faces reddened while staring at him.<br>&ldquo;News sure spread fast here.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was surprised at how everyone seemed to have already heard of him even though he had just joined the North Tortoise Hall not too long ago. In any case, this wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing.<br>His motive for joining the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was to save Zi Ling, but saving Zi Ling was no easy feat. After all, the one who had imprisoned Zi Ling was the sectmaster of the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. In order to achieve his goal, he had to first make a name for himself within the sect, possibly even becoming the strongest disciple here.<br>Otherwise, there was no way he could win the acknowledgment of the sectmaster and save Zi Ling.<br>&ldquo;You were looking for me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Even though Tu Yuanyuan was beautiful and had treated him warmly thus far, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t have a particularly good impression of her even though he didn&rsquo;t detest her.<br>He knew that the reason why Tu Yuanyuan was treating him differently was because she was aware of his reputation in the Holy Light Galaxy. She knew of the strength and potential he wielded, and that was why she was approaching him. Her intention was never pure in the first place.<br>This could be seen from how she asked Hua Xu whether he was in closed-door training before entering the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. She could have told everyone about his affairs, but she chose to keep it to herself. She didn&rsquo;t want others to know how formidable Chu Feng was as it would be easier for her to get closer to him that way.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just here to visit you. No matter what, we&rsquo;re disciples who have joined the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect at the same time. I can be considered your junior, right?&rdquo; Tu Yuanyuan asked with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Then, Junior Tu, what business do you have with me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked once more.<br>Seeing how Chu Feng was as nonchalant as before, Tu Yuanyuan pouted in dissatisfaction. With a deep sigh, she leaned toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears and sent a voice transmission to him.<br>&ldquo;Are you unhappy because I didn&rsquo;t tell the others about your accomplishments in the Holy Light Galaxy?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You do know about my affairs after all,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked.<br>&ldquo;Of course I do! I didn&rsquo;t say it out loud because I thought that you didn&rsquo;t want them to know. If you want me to reveal it, I can tell them how formidable you are right now,&rdquo; Tu Yuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;If you want to say it, go ahead. If you don&rsquo;t want to, so be it. This has nothing to do with me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to leave the decision in my hands, it goes without saying that I&rsquo;d keep the matter to myself,&rdquo; Tu Yuanyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Oh? Why is that so?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s curiosity was piqued.<br>&ldquo;For one, they might not necessarily believe it even if I tell them about it. However, if they do really believe it, that makes things even more complicated for me. Wouldn&rsquo;t I just bring myself more love rivals?&rdquo; Tu Yuanyuan chuckled.<br>Her honesty made Chu Feng think a little better of her.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t averse to smart people; he just preferred people to be straightforward with him. Tu Yunayuan&rsquo;s candidness scored some brownie points with him.<br>&ldquo;So, Junior Tu, is there any important matter you have for me here? Otherwise, I&rsquo;d like to take a rest. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ve taken how you spoke up on my behalf when Hua Xu provoked me earlier to heart. I&rsquo;m a person who repays my debt, so if you need my help in the future, as long as it&rsquo;s within my means, I&rsquo;ll lend you a helping hand,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Ohhh! You said that you owe me one yourself. Hmm, I guess I should start thinking about what I want from you. Alright, I shan&rsquo;t stand in the way of your rest anymore. I&rsquo;ll see you around, cold-natured Senior Chu.&rdquo;<br>Tu Yuanyuan took out a scroll and passed it to Chu Feng before turning around to leave the area.<br>&ldquo;Cold-hearted Senior Chu, if you have time, do drop by my place. I don&rsquo;t know whether the others in the East Dragon Hall would welcome you, but you can be certain that I&rsquo;ll welcome you!&rdquo;<br>Tu Yuanyuan waved at Chu Feng before flying into the distance.<br>Chu Feng unrolled the scroll and saw that it was a map. It was pointing out where Tu Yuanyuan&rsquo;s residence in the East Dragon Hall was.<br>Out of respect, Chu Feng accepted the scroll.<br>He was planning to enter his residence right away, but unexpectedly, the disciples all around suddenly swarmed in. They wanted to get acquainted with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What are all of you doing? Don&rsquo;t you find it disgraceful to be fawning on a new disciple like that? Scram!&rdquo;<br>Unexpectedly, a loud bellow suddenly sounded, and the crowd around Chu Feng quickly scattered in all directions.<br>Following that, three male disciples from the North Tortoise Hall walked in. Their cultivation was much higher compared to the rest of the disciples gathered around, being at Utmost Exalted level.<br>The leader of the trio seemed to be the bald man standing at the center, and he was the one who spoke up earlier. He was at rank two Utmost Exalted level.<br>The other two men following them were at rank one Utmost Exalted level.<br>&ldquo;You are Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>The three disciples began assessing Chu Feng with a lofty gaze.<br>&ldquo;Yes. Do you have business with me?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s attitude wasn&rsquo;t particularly polite. He wasn&rsquo;t a rude person, but he tended to treat people how they treated him. If the other party treated him courteously, he would treat them courteously as well regardless of their cultivation level. Similarly, if someone spoke to him rudely, he wouldn&rsquo;t see any need to remain polite no matter how powerful they were.<br>The three of them had been looking at him with eyes filled with contempt, so there was no way Chu Feng would take it kindly.<br>Clearly, the three men didn&rsquo;t expect a new disciple like Chu Feng to dare speak to them rudely too. Their faces immediately darkened.<br></p></div>
