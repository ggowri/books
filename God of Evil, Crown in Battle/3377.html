        <div> - The Time When True Dragons Soar<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Tsk~~~&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie rolled her eyes at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the tsk about? How come your cultivation has increased again? Girl, you&rsquo;re truly amazing. You are most definitely a formidable opponent of mine,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>Chu Feng was not joking around. It was true that Wuma Shengjie&rsquo;s cultivation had increased again.<br>She was no longer a rank five Martial Immortal. Instead, her cultivation had increased to rank six Martial Immortal.<br>The speed at which her cultivation increased was not at all inferior to Chu Feng's.<br>After all, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that Chu Feng had gained comprehension on the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform, he would also only be a rank six Martial Immortal at that moment.<br>&ldquo;Haha, young friend Chu Feng, you don&rsquo;t have to be so modest. Shengjie has already mentioned to me that you have managed to unseal your Lightning Armor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if Shengjie were to fight you, I feel that Shengjie would definitely not be a match for you. Besides, since Shengjie was able to make gains from that Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant, I think that young friend Chu Feng must&rsquo;ve gained some harvest from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant too, no?&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief looked to Chu Feng with a beaming smile. There was a hidden implication within his gaze.<br>How could the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief not be able to tell that Chu Feng was concealing his cultivation? Furthermore, he knew that Wuma Shengjie was able to make a breakthrough in her cultivation thanks to her gains in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant. Thus, he guessed that Chu Feng had deliberately concealed his cultivation because he wanted to hide something. Likely, he had already made a breakthrough too.<br>He guessed that Chu Feng&rsquo;s current actual cultivation should be that of a rank six Martial Immortal.<br>&ldquo;Not most likely, instead, it&rsquo;s definitely,&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie said.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve discovered even that?&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled. Then, with a thought from Chu Feng, his rank seven Martial Immortal cultivation was released.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you&hellip; you actually managed to make two successive breakthroughs?&rdquo;<br>The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief immediately revealed an astonished expression upon sensing that Chu Feng&rsquo;s current cultivation was a level higher than he had expected.<br>It was not only him, as even Wuma Shengjie was looking at Chu Feng with a gaze filled with astonishment.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, that comprehensive ability of yours is simply too astonishing,&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief gasped with admiration.<br>&ldquo;This junior indeed managed to gain some harvest from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant. However, it is actually due to another opportunity that I encountered that I managed to gain my current cultivation.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he concealed his aura again. Although there was an unwritten rule in the martial cultivation world that if one were to conceal one&rsquo;s cultivation before one&rsquo;s senior, it would be a sign of disrespect, apart from those who were deliberately seeking trouble, no one would actually care about that.<br>The reason for that was because there was another saying in the martial cultivation world. That is, a person of the younger generation concealing his or her cultivation was a sign of modesty.<br>In fact, it was not only the people of the younger generation; many people of the older generation also made a habit of concealing their cultivation.<br>As for Chu Feng, he was not concealing his cultivation for modesty&rsquo;s sake.<br>He was merely doing it because he felt like it. He would conceal and reveal his cultivation depending on what he felt like doing. And at that moment&hellip; he just so happened to want to conceal his cultivation.<br>&ldquo;What sort of opportunity did you encounter again?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie asked curiously. Judging from her appearance, she seemed to be very curious about how Chu Feng managed to increase his cultivation to rank seven Martial Immortal.<br>After all, people had competitive desires. She had only just managed to catch up to Chu Feng with great difficulty. Yet, it turned out that she was once again surpassed by Chu Feng. If anyone else were in her shoes, they would also be somewhat unwilling to accept it.<br>If Chu Feng had truly managed to increase his cultivation elsewhere, she would feel a bit better.<br>Otherwise, she would feel unwell. After all, that would mean that Chu Feng&rsquo;s comprehensive ability was simply too much stronger than hers. This would give her a feeling of defeat.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling the truth, I wouldn&rsquo;t lie to you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, where did you encounter that opportunity?&rdquo;<br>Wuma Shengjie, a person of few words, was actually asking successive questions. Sure enough, she cared about this matter a lot.<br>&ldquo;If I am to tell you that this opportunity of mine came from being struck by lightning, would you believe me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to tell me, then forget about it,&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie cast a side-eye at Chu Feng. Evidently, she did not believe him in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling the truth. I&rsquo;m not lying to you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a grin.<br>Seeing such an attitude from Chu Feng, Wuma Shengjie believed him even less. Soon after, she decided to ignore him completely.<br>&ldquo;Shengjie, do not be rude,&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief quietly berated Wuma Shengjie. However, she paid absolutely no attention to him.<br>Evidently, the Lord Clan Chief was not at all imposing to Wuma Shengjie. This caused him to feel rather embarrassed.<br>&ldquo;Senior, it&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s fine. Shengjie and I are good friends. This is normal between friends,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Tsk~~~&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie curled her lips. She reacted as if she did not appreciate Chu Feng&rsquo;s friendliness in the slightest. However, a trace of happiness was present in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;It is truly Shengjie&rsquo;s good fortune to have a friend like young friend Chu Feng. If only Shengjie could be as sensible as young friend Chu Feng, this old man would be completely at ease,&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief sighed.<br>Afterwards, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief continued to chat with Chu Feng on the journey, whereas Wuma Shengjie remained cold and detached. She would not even look at Chu Feng, and would only grace them with her gaze when they mentioned something that interested her.<br>Unknowingly, Chu Feng, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Wuma Shengjie passed through the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Teleportation Formation and arrived in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.<br>Once Chu Feng exited the teleportation formation, a shocked expression immediately appeared on his face.<br>Ignoring the magnificent sceneries of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm, Chu Feng immediately felt his senses assaulted by the natural energies here, which were much more intense than those of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>The difference in natural energy could directly affect a martial cultivator&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>Evidently, the Nine Dragons Upper Realm was extremely precious, and not something that the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm could compare to. It was no wonder the Tantai Heavenly Clan would occupy it.<br>Most importantly, a vast crowd was gathered at the exit of the teleportation formation. Both heaven and earth were packed with people.<br>Furthermore, more and more people were walking out of the teleportation formation&rsquo;s exit following Chu Feng and the others.<br>There were people from all different powers. There were even many Exalted-level experts hidden among them.<br>One should know that this was only one of the many teleportation formations in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.<br>However, there were an enormous amount of experts present. Even someone like the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would not dare to say that he was the strongest among them.<br>From this, exactly how many grand characters were gathered in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm at that moment could be seen.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that I will be able to broaden my horizons this time around,&rdquo; Witnessing this scene, Chu Feng became exceptionally excited.<br>The more bustling a place was, the higher of a chance there was for true dragons to soar.<br>The Nine Dragons Upper Realm was most definitely the best opportunity for him to prove himself.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng made the decision that as long as he could remove Bai Liluo&rsquo;s seal ahead of time, he would definitely participate in the contest for the Ancestral Martial Decastars.<br>He needed to have everyone in the Ancestral Martial Starfield know that Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son had returned.<br></p></div>
