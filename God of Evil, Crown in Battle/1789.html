        <h1>Chapter 1788</h1>
        <div> - Successful Capture<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, at the moment when the two of them were about to fight, a surge of boundless oppressive might came out of nowhere and landed on Baili Xinghe. Like chains, that oppressive might firmly restricted his movements.<br>That oppressive might was so powerful that Baili Xinghe was unable to struggle free, and he was crushed deep into the ground by it.<br>Then, that oppressive might moved. Like a dragon surging out from the sea, it leapt out from underground. Baili Xinghe was also brought out alongside it.<br>Merely, at this moment, Baili Xinghe&rsquo;s complexion was pale like paper. He had a painful expression on his face as creaking sounds emitted from his body nonstop.<br>Those were the sounds of bones breaking...<br>Although that oppressive might did not leave Baili Xinghe with heavy injuries, it brought him enormous pressure and was crushing down on his entire body, including even his dantian and soul.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, a woman&rsquo;s silhouette suddenly descended from above. She slowly floated down to land before Baili Xinghe.<br>This woman was none other than Leng Yue.<br>Leng Yue had a cold expression on her face. Without the slightest trace of emotion, she looked to Baili Xinghe and said, &ldquo;My opponent is not someone that you can touch.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Baili Xinghe was startled. Although it lasted only a moment, Chu Feng had managed to see fear in Baili Xinghe&rsquo;s eyes.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing this scene, Chu Feng laughed slightly. Back then, he had thought Baili Xinghe to be the strongest genius in the Holy Land of Martialism. However, upon seeing him today, it turned out that he was nothing much.<br>The moral integrity Baili Xinghe possessed was greatly inferior to that of Yan Xie, Zhang Tianyi and the others.<br>For someone like him, regardless of how talented he might be, he would still not be able to escape his destiny of being scum. He was someone that bullied the weak and feared the strong and would use any means to obtain his goals.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s anger was lessened enormously. Although Baili Xinghe&rsquo;s actions were excessive, from his nature, Chu Feng could tell that he was destined to be a minor character and unworthy for Chu Feng to fight against.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, Leng Yue tossed out three golden bowls. After the three golden bowls were tossed into the air, they all disappeared.<br>Chu Feng was able to sense that there were three invisible powers that had now enveloped this region of space.<br>Those three golden bowls were treasures. Evidently, they had sealed off this region. With the concealment of the three golden bowls, no one would be able to detect anything even if Chu Feng and Leng Yue were to cause utter devastation with their battle.<br>This Leng Yue had truly come prepared.<br>&ldquo;You and that Zhang Tianyi are fellow martial brothers?&rdquo; Leng Yue asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That senior brother of yours is truly amazing. He&rsquo;s actually Emperor Gong&rsquo;s successor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, regardless of what sort of dogshit luck he has stumbled upon, I still look down on him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you know why I said that he was unqualified to be my opponent?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although he was only a minor character back then, I still remember him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back then&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to say anymore. I will take revenge for him,&rdquo; Before Leng Yue even finished her words, Chu Feng interrupted her.<br>He knew what Leng Yue was planning to say. Leng Yue was planning to mention how Zhang Tianyi had been disgraced before him and Baili Xinghe.<br>If this matter were to spread, it would affect Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s reputation. Chu Feng would naturally not allow her to say it.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case. No wonder that Chu Feng would run all the way over here. He had already made an appointment with Leng Yue.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Baili Xinghe came to a sudden realization that Chu Feng had come here because he had made an appointment to fight against Leng Yue.<br>Upon thinking about this, the corners of Baili Xinghe&rsquo;s mouth lifted into a sinister smile.<br>Although he would not be able to take care of Chu Feng himself, if Leng Yue were to kill Chu Feng for him, it would be even better. After all, he would not have to bear any criminal charges should that be the case.<br>Furthermore, he knew very well how strong Leng Yue was. For Leng Yue to take care of Chu Feng, it would be as simple as an adult taking care of a child. After all, even he, Baili Xinghe, feared Leng Yue.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip; avenge him you say? You must have the ability to do so first,&rdquo; Leng Yue laughed mockingly. Although she wished to fight against Chu Feng, she also did not place Chu Feng in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;I will not be lenient against you. However, my world spirit wishes to watch our battle. Might that be doable?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Is it to see you be defeated? Very well, since there&rsquo;s already a spectator, one more will not amount to anything. Go ahead, release your world spirit,&rdquo; Leng Yue said in an indifferent manner.<br>&ldquo;Remember, it&rsquo;s not release. Instead, it&rsquo;s invite,&rdquo; Chu Feng corrected Leng Yue. Then, he opened his World Spirit Gate.<br>&ldquo;Damned girl, this Queen is here to see how you&rsquo;ll be beaten,&rdquo; After Eggy walked out, she first took a disdainful glance at Leng Yue. Then, she walked over to Baili Xinghe.<br>Seeing that Baili Xinghe was staring at her with fixed eyes, Eggy had a displeased expression, &ldquo;That hell are you looking at? Never seen a beauty before?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen quite a few beauties. However, it is the first time that I&rsquo;ve seen a world spirit as beautiful as you,&rdquo; Baili Xinghe said with a light smile. Although he was extremely hostile toward Chu Feng, he was very amiable toward Eggy. In fact, he was even polite.<br>Seeing this, Chu Feng&rsquo;s impression of Baili Xinghe took a hundred and eighty degree change again.<br>When he first met Baili Xinghe, Baili Xinghe had been towering from above, and emitted an air of arrogance. Like a saint, he had not placed any of his fellow generation in his eyes.<br>However, never would Chu Feng have expected that this fellow, who seemed to be unaffected by female charms on the surface, was actually an utter pervert. From the gaze that he was looking at Eggy with, it could be seen what he was thinking in his mind.<br>&ldquo;All those who have seen this Queen said the same things you did. However, it&rsquo;s still the first time that this Queen has seen someone as disgusting as you. Pah!&rdquo; After finishing her words, Eggy spit on Baili Xinghe. Then, she said, &ldquo;Turn your disgusting gaze away. The more you look at me, the more disgusted I feel.&rdquo;<br>After Eggy finished saying those words, she arrogantly walked toward a more distant location.<br>As for Baili Xinghe, he was shivering in anger. As the grand personal disciple of the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, when had he ever suffered from this sort of humiliation?<br>However, his body was currently bound by Leng Yue&rsquo;s power, and simply incapable of moving. Even though he was enraged, there was nothing he could do.<br>&ldquo;Is that an Asura World Spirit? Quite arrogant indeed. However, with her nature, sooner or later, she&rsquo;ll suffer,&rdquo; Leng Yue said.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s past achievements were already widespread. As matters stood, practically everyone in the Holy Land of Martialism knew that Chu Feng, when disregarding his talent for martial cultivation, was a legendary Asura World Spiritist.<br>Chu Feng was not anxious to fight right away. Instead, he asked,  &ldquo;Leng Yue, you said that as long as I come to fight you, you will bestow me a gift. What might that gift be?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; As Leng Yue spoke, she raised her hand and tossed a Cosmos Sack to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng inspected the Cosmos Sack, and discovered that there were actually ten Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones inside.<br>&ldquo;These bits of things, are you trying to shoo a beggar away?&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered and threw the Cosmos Sack back to Leng Yue.<br>&ldquo;You actually think that that is insufficient? You must know that these are ten Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones,&rdquo; Leng Yue frowned. She had truly never expected that Chu Feng would think that these ten Dragon Mark World Spirit Stones would be insufficient.<br>&ldquo;Of course they&rsquo;re insufficient,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well, tell me, what do you want?&rdquo; Leng Yue raised her brows and asked.<br>&ldquo;I want all the treasures on you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said while looking at Leng Yue.<br>&ldquo;You are truly boasting shamelessly. You actually want all of my treasures? Has someone smashed your head so badly today that you&rsquo;ve gone stupid?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Leng Yue sneered. The way she saw it, what Chu Feng said was extremely unrealistic and simply day-dreaming.<br>&ldquo;I never said that I want all of your possessions without a good cause. The two of us shall fight one another fairly. The loser will hand over all their possessions to the winner.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he opened his Cosmos Sack and took out the Heavenly Immortal Sword, the Evil God Sword and his various other treasures to show them to Leng Yue.<br>Seeing the treasures in Chu Feng&rsquo;s Cosmos Sack, Leng Yue&rsquo;s gaze began to change nonstop. Especially when she saw the Evil God Sword, her gaze was staring deeply at it.<br>&ldquo;Very well, since you have the courage, I shall gamble with you. If you are able to win against me, I will give you all of my treasures. However, if you are to lose, you will hand all of your treasures over to me,&rdquo; Being enticed by Chu Feng&rsquo;s treasures, Leng Yue was successfully ensnared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s trap.<br></p></div>
