        <div> - Kill!!!<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Lingxi, your mother is very powerful.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was also filled with admiration after witnessing Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s strength. Unable to contain himself, he looked to Chu Lingxi, who stood beside him.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, is my mother the only one that&rsquo;s powerful? Am I not powerful myself?&rdquo; [1. The reason why Lingxi is addressing Chu Feng as big brother will be explained in the future.]<br>Chu Lingxi looked at Chu Feng and revealed a naughty smile on her charming face.<br>Then, she released her aura.<br>At that instant, the expressions of everyone present changed.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s aura was the same as Chu Feng's; it was that of a rank three Exalted.<br>However, one should know that Chu Lingxi had been much weaker when she'd left.<br>Although the talent she had revealed back then could be considered to be top tier in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, it could not be considered to be top tier in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>However, at this moment, she actually possessed a cultivation of rank three Exalted. That cultivation surpassed the great majority of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>The first thing the crowd thought of after witnessing the enormous transformation of Chu Lingxi was her mother, Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, girl, you are truly well-concealed,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>He had a very good relationship with Chu Lingxi. She could be said to be the person of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations that he had the best relationship with.<br>After all, when he returned to the Chu Heavenly Clan and no one wanted to accept him, Chu Lingxi was the first person to acknowledge him.<br>Thus, upon witnessing her cultivation, Chu Feng felt happy for her from the bottom of his heart.<br>&ldquo;Well concealed? No, it&rsquo;s actually all due to my mother&rsquo;s help. It&rsquo;s you who&rsquo;s powerful. You&rsquo;ve obtained your cultivation on your own.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, big brother Chu Feng, cultivation and such aren't important. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, learning that you were still alive after I exited my closed-door training was the best news,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Girl, thanks,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Why are you thanking me?&rdquo; asked Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it due to you that your mother is willing to come to our aid?&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Everyone knew about the relationship between Gu Mingyuan and Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>However, the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan and the Chu Heavenly Clan did not have a friendly relationship.<br>If they did, the Chu Heavenly Clan wouldn&rsquo;t have been bullied by so many powers for so long.<br>If the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan was willing to protect the Chu Heavenly Clan, who would dare come to bully them?<br>However, Gu Mingyuan not only rescued the Chu Heavenly Clan during their time of trouble, but she also captured the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s experts.<br>Chu Feng felt that this was most definitely Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s contribution.<br>&ldquo;And here I was wondering what it was. I am also a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan. Both my father and grandfather are in the Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, it really isn&rsquo;t due to me that my mother was willing to come to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s aid today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Originally, I had wanted to return to see you after I learned that you were still alive upon exiting my closed-door training.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I had wanted to return by myself. However, my mother insisted on returning with me. She said&hellip; she also wanted to meet you,&rdquo; said Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s such a thing?&rdquo; Chu Feng was startled to hear those words.<br>&ldquo;What Lingxi said is correct,&rdquo; right at that moment, Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s voice was heard. She had arrived before Chu Feng.<br>Gu Mingyuan had a look of arrogance and conceit when facing the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master. It seemed like there was no one worthy of her respect in the world.<br>However, the powerful Gu Mingyuan was currently looking at Chu Feng with a faint smile on her face.<br>If they hadn't witnessed it themselves, no one would believe that Gu Mingyuan could have such an amiable side to her.<br>&ldquo;Junior Chu Feng pays his respects to senior.&rdquo; Chu Feng immediately greeted Gu Mingyuan.<br>After all, Gu Mingyuan was not only the princess of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, but she was also Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s mother. If it must be said, they could be considered to be family too.<br>&ldquo;Not only do you resemble your father. It also appears that Chu Xuanyuan has a qualified successor to carry on his name,&rdquo; said Gu Mingyuan.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you know my father?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met him several times,&rdquo; said Gu Mingyuan. Then, she waved her sleeve and her boundless martial power turned into countless arrows. The arrows were fixed in the sky, and completely surrounded the people that had submitted to the Blood-devouring Hall.<br>&ldquo;Lady Gu Mingyuan, please spare us, please spare us!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the situation was bad, those people immediately knelt in midair and began kowtowing to Gu Mingyuan in the hopes of being spared.<br>They knew very well that if those arrows shot towards them, all of them would die.<br>However, Gu Mingyuan completely ignored them. Instead, she turned her gaze to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, their lives are in your hands. You can kill or spare them as you wish.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked at those people. A trace of ruthlessness flashed through his eyes as he said, &ldquo;Kill.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Chu Feng&rsquo;s words left his mouth, the arrows that filled the sky acted as if they had received an order.<br>Like rain, the arrows shot towards those cultivators from all directions.<br>Following the arrows was a rain of blood.<br>In merely the blink of an eye, all those experts had died. Not a single person survived.<br>Seeing that, the bystanders and even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen all sucked in a mouthful of cold air.<br>One must know that those people were no ordinary people. Instead, they were all experts. Yet, all of them were instantly killed by Gu Mingyuan.<br>This was the disparity between those of different cultivations. The power someone of a higher cultivation had was simply unstoppable.<br>This not only illustrated how powerful Utmost Exalted-level experts were. It also allowed them to realize that even the people that they considered to be top experts could be easily obliterated should one possess sufficient power.<br>This&hellip; was the absolute superiority of a higher cultivation.<br></p></div>
