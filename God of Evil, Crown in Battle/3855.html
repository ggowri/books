        <h1>Chapter 3854</h1>
        <div> - Acting Promptly<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After pondering for some time, Chu Feng ultimately decided to join hands with the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>Even though the Mystic Cave Saints were very unreliable, and cooperating with them would be very dangerous, Chu Feng felt that they were indeed people that had a baseline.<br>It was as the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints had said, the eleven of them had a very good relationship.<br>Of course, the most important thing was that the Mystic Cave Saints had a map of the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb. If that map was real, it would mean that they would gain a decisive opportunity over the All-heaven Sect.<br>That was the reason why Chu Feng had decided to take such a risk.<br>After making his decision, Chu Feng planned to go and find Yin Zhuanghong to bid her farewell.<br>When the welcoming banquet for the All-heaven Sect concluded, Chu Feng proceeded toward Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s residence.<br>As the Holy Daughter of the Red-dress Holy Land, Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s residence was remarkable.<br>Her residence encompassed an entire floating island.<br>That island was extremely large, and resembled an isolated world. Everything inside the isolated world belonged to Yin Zhuanghong.<br>As she possessed a very antisocial personality, she did not even have any servant girls on the island.<br>Thus, she was the only person living on the enormous island.<br>To Chu Feng&rsquo;s surprise, after he arrived at the island, he discovered the auras of two different people on the island.<br>Apart from Yin Zhuanghong, the other person was&hellip; Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;Why is this guy here?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt that Yin Zhuanghong actually greatly detested Nangong Yifan, and would not have invited him over as a guest unless there was some sort of ulterior motive.<br>Thus, Chu Feng immediately unleashed his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes with the intention to check things out.<br>With his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes activated, Chu Feng&rsquo;s field of vision immediately increased many times over.<br>Even though he had only just set foot onto the island, he was able to clearly see everything on it.<br>As expected, Yin Zhuanghong and Nangong Yifan both appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s field of vision.<br>Not only was Chu Feng able to see them, but he was also able to read what they were saying through the movement of their lips.<br>Yin Zhuanghong and Nangong Yifan were both standing outside a palace.<br>That palace was Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s sleeping palace.<br>&ldquo;Nangong Yifan, it is already late, exactly what are you planning to do by coming to my residence without my permission?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Leave immediately. Else, do not blame me for becoming impolite.&rdquo;<br>Yin Zhuanghong had an ice-cold expression and anger in her eyes as she looked to Nangong Yifan.<br>Chu Feng gained a rough idea of what was happening from her words.<br>It turned out that Nangong Yifan had come to Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s residence uninvited.<br>&ldquo;Miss Yin, you know of my feelings for you. I only wish to ask you one thing today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I, Nangong Yifan, wish to take you as my wife. Are you willing to marry me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Should you be willing, I can give you anything you want as a betrothal gift. Just tell me what it is and I&rsquo;ll get it for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, I can guarantee that if you are willing to marry me, I will never take any concubines, and love only you for the rest of my life.&rdquo;<br>Nangong Yifan was extremely emotional as he said those words.<br>That Nangong Yifan was normally very uncommunicative, and extremely proud. Never would Chu Feng have imagined that he would actually be so passionate when facing Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Chu Feng suspected that as long as she said she was willing, Nangong Yifan would even kneel without any hesitation.<br>&ldquo;Nangong Yifan, it&rsquo;s impossible for you and me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Leave immediately. I am going to rest.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Yin Zhuanghong turned around with the intention to enter her sleeping palace.<br>As for Nangong Yifan, he stood there shivering from anger.<br>Soon afterward, his expression changed completely. His gaze was like that of a crazed ferocious beast.<br>Nangong Yifan suddenly extended his hand and grabbed Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s wrist.<br>&ldquo;Let go of me.&rdquo;<br>Yin Zhuanghong turned around. A look of anger filled her ice-cold gaze.<br>However, Nangong Yifan, who had always been obedient to Yin Zhanghong, did not listen to her this time around. Instead, he stared fiercely at her. &ldquo;I know why you don&rsquo;t want to marry me. It&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s someone else in your heart.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did you fall for that Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng is of low birth. Everything about me is superior to him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you believe that I will call my men and extinguish his entire clan tomorrow?&rdquo;<br>Nangong Yifan was extremely furious. His tone sounded somewhat crazed.<br>&ldquo;I will say it again. Let go of me. Otherwise, I am going to be impolite with you.&rdquo;<br>Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s gaze turned even colder. She was not joking around.<br>&ldquo;Impolite? I wish to see how you&rsquo;re going to be impolite with me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You damned bitch who refuses the face that is given to you. Today, I am going to make you mine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After today, even if you want to marry me, I wouldn&rsquo;t marry you. You&rsquo;ll only be my plaything.&rdquo;<br>Engulfed in rage, how could Nangong Yifan possibly listen to Yin Zhuanghong? As he spoke, he extended his other hand and grabbed her clothes.<br>Yin Zhuanghong immediately avoided his hand upon seeing that. However, the cuff of her sleeve was still grabbed by Nangong Yifan.<br>With a tear, one of Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s sleeves was torn apart by Nangong Yifan, revealing her arm.<br>&ldquo;Nangong Yifan, have you gone mad?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What sort of place did you take this to be? This is the Red-dress Holy Land!&rdquo;<br>Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s voice was trembling. Killing intent appeared in her beautiful eyes.<br>She was truly furious, and really wanted to kill Nangong Yifan.<br>Unfortunately, she could not. In fact, she did not dare to attack Nangong Yifan.<br>In reality, Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s strength surpassed Nangong Yifan's.<br>However, for some special reason, she had been concealing her cultivation.<br>Because of that special reason, even though Nangong Yifan had unleashed his beastial nature, Yin Zhuanghong was still exercising restraint, and not attacking him.<br>As for Nangong Yifan, he had already lost all sense of reasoning due to his anger.<br>After he saw Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s fair-skinned, beautiful arm, he became even more crazed.<br>He leapt, and pounced toward Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;Scram!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a furious shout was heard.<br>Following that, Nangong Yifan, who had already leapt into the air, let out a scream and was sent flying.<br>The next moment, Nangong Yifan who had landed on the ground, had a stunned look. As for Yin Zhuanghong, she was also completely shocked.<br>The reason for that was because a figure had appeared between the two of them.<br>Naturally, that person was Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
