        <div> - Stirring Up A Sensation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng held the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone in his hand and revealed a smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what did you discover?&rdquo; Eggy asked curiously. Even though she was able to share Chu Feng&rsquo;s vision with him, she was unable to tell what he was thinking, nor was she able to sense what Chu Feng was currently sensing from the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.<br>&ldquo;This Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone contains an entirely separate space inside it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such a thing? Are you able to enter it?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;This space is most definitely not something that just anyone could enter. However, I&hellip; am able to enter it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said confidently.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng swept his gaze through the crowd, and saw their stunned expressions.<br>From that, Chu Feng became even more certain that the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone was most likely as Tian Yi and the others had said, that it was not something that anyone could remove.<br>However, not only did Chu Feng easily remove it, he was also able to sense the space within the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.<br>All of that pointed to one thing -- that the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone possessed some sort of connection with Chu Feng.<br>It was as if the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone had been prepared for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Quickly, go in and have a look. Maybe there are treasures there,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said excitedly.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng did not hesitate. With a shift of his body, Chu Feng turned into blue light and entered the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?!!!&rdquo;<br>The crowd had their eyes fixed onto Chu Feng the entire time. As such, they clearly saw what had happened just then. To them, it appeared as if Chu Feng had been sucked into the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.<br>However, before then, they had never heard of the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone possessing such an ability. As such, the crowd were feeling extremely alarmed and frightened. One by one, they moved away, distancing themselves from the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what happened earlier? Could it be that he triggered the power of the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, and was refined by it?&rdquo;<br>The crowd that didn't know exactly what had happened all thought that Chu Feng was killed by the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.<br>While all that was happening, Chu Feng had already entered the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.<br>This was an isolated space. The space was not very big. It was only large enough to contain a hundred people.<br>However, the walls of this place seemed to be formed of jadeite. They were jade green, and glimmering brightly. The materials of the walls greatly resembled the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone itself.<br>&ldquo;Why is there nothing here?&rdquo; After observing the surroundings, Her Lady Queen revealed a disappointed expression.<br>She had thought that there would be treasures inside this space. However, there was nothing here at all.<br>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that there&rsquo;s nothing here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am certain that this place&hellip; is most definitely a place that our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s seniors prepared for later generations,&rdquo; Compared to Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s disappointment, Chu Feng was feeling very excited.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you sense something?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked excitedly.<br>&ldquo;Natural Energies and the way of martial cultivation, this place contains both of them,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You mean to say?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen revealed an excited expression. Being clever and quick-witted, she had already managed to guess some things.<br>&ldquo;This place is a treasure deposit that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s seniors meticulously left behind. Not only am I able to obtain a great amount of Natural Energies, I am also able to make quick breakthroughs in cultivation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s actually the case? Quickly, refine the Natural Energies,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen was even more impatient than Chu Feng.<br>After all, what Chu Feng needed to do the most right now was reach breakthroughs in cultivation. The opportunity before him was simply akin to someone sending him charcoal in snowy weather. He had simply discovered it at the perfect time.<br>&ldquo;Merely, I fear that I will not be able to avoid the Divine Tribulation even in here. For the sake of my safety, it is best that I set up a spirit formation first.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he set up a layer of spirit formations that adhered to the jadeite walls in the space.<br>After Chu Feng finished those preparations, he sat down cross-legged and began to wholeheartedly refine the Natural Energies.<br>While this place possessed abundant amounts of Natural Energy, Chu Feng&rsquo;s ability to refine them was superior.<br>In merely a short moment, Chu Feng had already refined all of the Natural Energies within that isolated space.<br>If it had been before he had reached Half Martial Ancestor, Chu Feng would definitely have reached a breakthrough immediately after refining the Natural Energies.<br>However, he was currently obstructed by bottlenecks now. His path of martial cultivation was no longer as smooth as it had been before.<br>This matter had been on Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind the entire time. Thus, regardless of whether he might be resting, journeying to some place or in a certain land, Chu Feng would always attempt to comprehend the path of martial cultivation.<br>He had never once stopped that sort of training.<br>That said, Chu Feng&rsquo;s efforts had not been in vain. To Chu Feng, this ended up being extremely helpful.<br>This was made evident when Chu Feng encountered the first bottleneck before him, the junction to break through to rank six Half Martial Ancestor. Chu Feng did not have to rely on any external forces, nor did he have to waste time on comprehension.<br>Instead, merely by relying on the comprehension he had come to within that period of time, Chu Feng managed to break through the bottleneck.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation did not immediately reach a breakthrough. Instead, he started to frown. He opened his eyes, and then looked skyward. &ldquo;Oh crap!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked in confusion.<br>&ldquo;Right now, I am breaking through to rank six Half Martial Ancestor. This means that I will have to withstand fifty percent of the Divine Tribulation&rsquo;s power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With fifty percent, the Divine Tribulation&rsquo;s power will no longer be formless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I was so anxious to reach a breakthrough that I actually forgot about that,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What do we do then?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen asked.<br>&ldquo;Unless this Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone possesses some special power that can conceal the Divine Tribulation&hellip; I fear that I will cause a great commotion,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...<br>At the same time, outside of the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. In the Hundred Refinements Stage. Everyone was looking toward the sky with raised heads. Expressions of fear filled their eyes.<br>Even though the Hundred Refinements Stage was sealed by a spirit formation, they were able to see the sky from within the Hundred Refinements Stage&rsquo;s spirit formation.<br>At that moment, black clouds were surging in the sky. Lightning was flickering, and thunder was rumbling nonstop. The lightning pierced through the sky, and the rumbles shook the earth.<br>Black clouds and lightning were things that the crowd had all seen before. For cultivators like them, they were easily able to create abnormal signs in the sky. Logically, this should be a very common sight. There shouldn&rsquo;t be a reason for any of them to care about it.<br>However, what the crowd was seeing right now was completely different.<br>Firstly, the black clouds and lightning originated from deep within the sky. It was a height that martial cultivators were unable to reach.<br>It was impossible for an abnormal sign to appear in a place like that.<br>As for the black clouds, although they did not cover a vast area, they were surging violently like an army of countless demons galloping in the sky. Looking at them, one would feel painfully oppressed. The black clouds were so frightening, they made one feel like they were suffocating.<br>However, the main reason why the crowd was so frightened was the lightning flickering in the clouds.<br>That lightning was simply too frightening. It was no ordinary lightning, and resembled dragons more than anything else.<br>Those were lightning dragons capable of splitting apart heaven and earth, capable of extinguishing all living things.<br>To the crowd, a scene like that was truly frightening to the extreme. Even though they were all martial cultivators, they were still extremely scared.<br>The reason for their fear was because they knew that they would undoubtedly die should a lightning bolt from the clouds strike them.<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...<br>In fact, it was not only the people from the Hundred Refinements Stage that noticed the change in the sky. Even some of the people from the guardian clan outside of the Hundred Refinements Stage noticed it.<br>At that moment, led by their clan chief, people from the guardian clan were standing in the sky in an orderly manner with their eyes fixed to the scene that was happening in the depths of the sky. They all had the same sort of expression on their faces. It was the expression of unease.<br>&ldquo;What is that?!&rdquo; The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief started to frown, and his frown grew denser and denser.<br>He had no idea exactly how powerful the lightning flickering in the black clouds was. However, he was able to tell that it was a power capable of destroying heaven and earth.<br>If the lightning was to pierce through the clouds and strike down, regardless of where it might land, the lightning would definitely bring about an unimaginable disaster.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Why does that lightning feel so frightening?&rdquo;<br>Kong Zheng, Hu Xuanyi and the others who were journeying through the Hundred Refinements Stage also stopped their movements. They looked to the sky with uneasy gazes.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a loud explosion was heard from the sky.<br>&ldquo;Oh no!!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, everyone felt immense uneasy.<br>They had discovered that a lightning bolt had pierced through the black cloud, and was striking down. Furthermore, it was striking straight down toward their destination.<br><br></p></div>
