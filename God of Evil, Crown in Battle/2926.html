        <div> - Appearance of the Clan Chief<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>After Jinshi Bo left, the expressions with which the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations looked to Chu Feng had, to a greater or lesser degree, changed.<br>They had actually heard about Chu Feng before. However, as they were people from the Chu Heavenly Clan, they felt themselves to be superior, and thus did not place Chu Feng in their eyes.<br>That said, after Chu Feng forced Jinshi Bo to leave in anger, their opinions of Chu Feng had changed slightly.<br>This was the first time that they&rsquo;d witnessed what sort of person that fellow by the name of Chu Feng was.<br>No matter what, Jinshi Bo was the price of the Goldenstone Royal Clan. They, as clansmen of the Chu Heavenly Clan, were capable of disregarding Jinshi Bo. However, what qualifications did Chu Feng have to disregard him?<br>Although they had heard the rumors regarding Chu Feng before, it remained that seeing was better than hearing.<br>When they actually witnessed Chu Feng for themselves, when they actually witnessed how much of a maverick he was, they were unable to not have a whole new level of respect for him.<br>That said, not long after Jinshi Bo left, that Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder that had left together with Jinshi Bo actually returned.<br>Furthermore, there was another person that had returned together with that Supreme Elder.<br>Once that individual appeared, the expressions of everyone present changed.<br>That person was a middle-aged man. He was wearing the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s outfit. Compared to Jinshi Bo and that Supreme Elder, that middle-aged man&rsquo;s outfit was even more gorgeous.<br>However, that was not the most important aspect. What was most important was that individual&rsquo;s aura.<br>That middle-aged man&rsquo;s aura was simply too deep and powerful. Once he appeared, he completely suppressed everyone else present.<br>Even Martial Immortal-level experts like Elder Xingyi became incomparably small before him.<br>Exalted. That man was an Exalted-level expert.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, that brat is Chu Feng,&rdquo; The Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder pointed to Chu Feng.<br>Once he said those words, the crowd present all realized who that middle-aged man was.<br>He was actually the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. In other words, he was most likely the most powerful expert in the entire Goldenstone Upper Realm.<br>No wonder he was so powerful.<br>When the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief appeared, even the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s haughty younger generations actually revealed expressions of reverence in their eyes.<br>This was for no other reason than because he was an Exalted-level expert.<br>That said, the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was focused only on Chu Feng.<br>There was no trace of anger in the gaze with which he looked to Chu Feng. He was just gazing at Chu Feng in a calm manner.<br>Chu Feng was also looking at him. Even though he knew that the man had come for him, there was no trace of panic in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Suddenly, the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke. &ldquo;You have courage and insight. Merely by your courage and insight, there was no grievance that my son has suffered by your hands,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re flattering me,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a faint smile.<br>&ldquo;However, little buddy, merely having courage and insight is not enough in this world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You cannot do something without leaving room to maneuver. Otherwise, you will end up regretting it,&rdquo; The Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, never do anything that would affect my conscience. As long as I feel that it is correct, I do not care what the consequences might be,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well. I admire you.&rdquo;<br>After the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said those words, he no longer said anything else. Instead, he stood at the front, and began to survey the auction hall below.<br>As for Chu Feng, he also turned his gaze toward the auction hall below.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, I think we should leave first.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice transmission entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears. It was Elder Xingyi.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I truly never expected the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to come here too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief has always been a person to shield his sons. While he might appear to be very calm and unaffected right now, he definitely will not be willing to take things lying down. After all, the amount of Immortal Martial Stones Jinshi Bo lost to you was not a small sum at all,&rdquo; Elder Xingyi said.<br>Hearing the tone in Elder Xingyi&rsquo;s voice, Chu feng was able to tell that Elder Xingyi was truly worried for him.<br>This was understandable too. After all, Elder Xingyi was here through Chu Feng&rsquo;s request to protect him.<br>However, faced with an existence like the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Elder Xingyi would also be powerless.<br>&ldquo;Senior, let&rsquo;s cancel the agreement we had before,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, what do you mean by that?&rdquo; Elder Xingyi revealed a surprised expression.<br>&ldquo;The disaster I&rsquo;ve provoked seems to be a bit big. I do not wish to implicate you and Miss Xia,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Chu Feng was also able to tell that the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had come with ill-intent.<br>Chu Feng said those words from the bottom of his heart. He truly did not wish to implicate Elder Xingyi and Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, you would be looking down on this old man should you say that sort of thing. This old man has made a promise with you. I will naturally have to commit to it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I urge you to leave because I do not wish for something to happen to you. However, if you insist on staying, this old man will protect you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not to mention the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, even if it were the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief that wanted to bring you harm, this old man would still not look on without doing anything,&rdquo; Elder Xingyi said.<br>There was actually a trace of anger in his voice when he said those words.<br>He was blaming Chu Feng for wanting him to withdraw at a time like this.<br>Chu Feng knew that his words had hurt Elder Xingyi&rsquo;s dignity.<br>After all, Elder Xingyi was a person who had cultivated for many years, a Martial Immortal-level expert that placed loyalty above all.<br>Thus, Chu Feng hurriedly apologized. &ldquo;Senior, I&rsquo;m sorry. This junior merely did not wish to implicate you. I did not mean anything else by it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, you don&rsquo;t have to apologize. Regardless of whether you decide to leave or stay, this old man will follow you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Remember, regardless of who it might be that wants to bring you harm, regardless of whether they might be Martial Immortals or Exalted-level experts, this old man will still protect you.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Elder Xingyi turned and moved away. He stopped his voice transmission conversation with Chu Feng.<br>Although Elder Xingyi said those words with an angry tone, Chu Feng did not blame him in the slightest. Instead, he was moved.<br>To insist on protecting the person beside him during a time of calamity for the sake of a promise, this was simply something too hard to come by.<br>However, Chu Feng did not choose to leave.<br>At such a time, leaving or not would not matter anymore.<br>For an expert at the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s level, if he wanted to take care of Chu Feng, Chu Feng would simply not be able to escape at all.<br>However, Chu Feng realized that the Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was not planning to take care of him right away. Perhaps it might be because he wanted to bid on some treasures. Or perhaps it might be because he possessed some sort of restraining fear toward something.<br>Regardless, he was, at the very least, not planning to take care of Chu Feng right away.<br>Thus, Chu Feng&rsquo;s decision to stay might be relatively safe.<br>If he had chosen to leave right away, he might actually really end up in danger.<br>Moreover, Chu Feng had things that he wanted to bid on. Naturally, he would not leave just like that.<br>That said, even if Chu Feng were to stay here, he could not just stand there without any preparations. Thus, Chu Feng secretly took out his Evil God Sword and held it tightly in his hand.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s action was done very gently. The people beside him did not notice it. However, one person noticed it. It was that Goldenstone Royal Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder.<br>He was paying attention to Chu Feng the entire time. Thus, when Chu Feng took out his Evil God Sword, he immediately looked at Chu Feng.<br>However, when he noticed that Chu Feng was actually holding an Incomplete Imperial Armament in his hand, a mocking sneer emerged on his face.<br><br><br></p></div>
