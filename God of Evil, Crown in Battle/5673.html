        <h1>Chapter 5673: The Sword’s Prowess?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t tell if the voice sounded more masculine or feminine, but it sounded childish. He was overjoyed to hear the sword&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Asura Sword, after all! Given the strength it was displaying, it would be of great help to him even if it was an imitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he hid his joy and instead asked, &ldquo;You can see through the formation?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What a joke. What have I never seen before? Do you think I wouldn&rsquo;t understand a minor formation like this?&rdquo; the Asura Sword sneered in impatience. &ldquo;Cut the crap and release the second seal. I&rsquo;ll eat you if you can&rsquo;t even do as much.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What if I succeed?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Are you going to do it or not? If not, I&rsquo;ll eat you right now!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a shudder, a black flame sparked on the tip of the Asura Sword. It was just a flicker, but Chu Feng sensed destructive energy that could obliterate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Open!&rdquo; Chu Feng quickly channeled his psyche into the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the formation emanated a brilliant glow that enveloped the gate. The second seal was released.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t open the gate but instead turned to the Asura Sword and asked, &ldquo;How about it?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you open another seal then?&rdquo; the Asura Sword asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What do I stand to gain? Are you just going to let me live?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t eat your psyche anymore if you manage to do it. However, I&rsquo;ll eat you up if you fail,&rdquo; the Asura Sword said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a deal,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He changed his seal and channeled his psyche toward the gate once again. But it didn&rsquo;t take long for his complexion to turn awful. There was a limit to his psyche even though it was much greater than that of other world spiritists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have feared the Asura Sword devouring his psyche.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was close to his limit, but he forced himself to hold on. It was a dangerous feat comparable to dancing on top of knives, where the slightest mistake could spell one&rsquo;s death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Gah!&rdquo; Chu Feng roared as he poured out an exceptionally huge surge of psyche.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flow of psyche stopped afterward, and he fell to his knees out of weakness, but his eyes remained focused on the door and the final surge of psyche. He was sweating profusely, and his body trembled nonstop, but his hand seal remained firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his control, his final surge of psyche gushed into the gate like a flood dragon descending into the sea, stirring huge ripples. An even brighter light gushed out from the formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng had succeeded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile crept from his lips as he turned to the Asura Sword and said, &ldquo;Looks like I&rsquo;ll be able to enter my World Spirit Space as and when I like.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Passable performance, but that&rsquo;s all there is to it,&rdquo; the Asura Sword said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good enough for me. May I ask you a question?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Speak.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You must have seen a lot in the Asura Spirit World. Do you know of a way to treat my friend?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was naturally referring to Eggy. He had a rough idea as to how he could treat Eggy, but he wasn&rsquo;t certain if it would work. He wondered if the Asura Sword might have a better idea, considering how formidable it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Do you not have eyes? I&rsquo;m a sword! Swords are born to kill, but you want me to save someone? You must have had your head kicked by an ass!&rdquo; the Asura Sword berated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t lose his temper. Instead, he said, &ldquo;Eggy said that you&rsquo;re no ordinary sword; you&rsquo;re the strongest sword in the Asura Spirit World.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother bootlicking me. Save her with your own means. Don&rsquo;t pin your hopes on me,&rdquo; the Asura Sword said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll find a way to save her by myself. You said that you&rsquo;re a sword, and swords are meant to kill. Are you willing to be used by me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re revealing your true intentions now? How impatient. Little thing, do you think you&rsquo;re worthy of wielding me?&rdquo; the Asura Sword spoke intimidatingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chu Feng was unfazed. &ldquo;If not me, no one else would be qualified.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;How awfully confident. Give it a try then,&rdquo; the Asura Sword sneered sinisterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any hesitation, Chu Feng walked up to the Asura Sword and grabbed its hilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world shook, as a black aura suffused his World Spirit Space. This wasn&rsquo;t oppressive might but terrifying killing intent, and the killing intent was frenziedly gushing into his body. Through the killing intent, he could sense how many people had died to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sword&rsquo;s kill count was beyond imagination; it should be calculated in the unit of realms or even </span><span>starfields</span><span>. This manifested into a killing intent so powerful that it could drive Chu Feng berserk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what shook him up the most wasn&rsquo;t because of the killing intent but because of something deeper he sensed within the sword. He could somehow sense that the sword had only appeared before the world once, but it had taken so many lives in that single encounter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It meant that the sword&rsquo;s attack must have sliced through an entire galaxy, destroying countless realms in its path. Otherwise, how could a single sword take so many lives?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sword was likely the real deal, as it was unimaginable for an imitation to be so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was overjoyed. It would be enough for him to tower above his peers, even if he couldn&rsquo;t draw out its full prowess. There were countless treasures in the world, but all of them paled in comparison to this sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a truly unparalleled treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he tried his best to resist the killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, the killing intent stopped trying to seep into his body. The black aura receded into the Asura Sword, and the World Spirit Space reverted to normalcy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re capable, but it&rsquo;s not enough. Don&rsquo;t get ahead of yourself. You still have a long way to go,&rdquo; the Asura Sword said proudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I know that I still have a long way to go, but can you point out a way for me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to know how he could gain control over the Asura Sword, but the latter didn&rsquo;t answer. He tried asking a few more questions, but there was still no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that the sword wasn&rsquo;t going to reply anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he tried to move the sword, but it wouldn&rsquo;t budge at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like I still have a long way to go,&rdquo; Chu Feng muttered before letting go of the sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn&rsquo;t disappointed as he had known that there was no way he could gain control of a sword with such prowess that easily. Thus, he turned his sight toward the gate where the Asura World Spirit Army was sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He formed a hand seal, and the gate shook. A blinding light surged through the other side of the gate like a tsunami before slowly fading. Everything slowly settled down, but Chu Feng knew the seal on the gate had been released.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he changed his hand seal and ordered, &ldquo;Open!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom </span><span>boom</span><span> </span><span>boom</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His World Spirit Space shook as the gate slowly creaked open. Millions of Asura World Spirits appeared before his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Asura World Spirit Army.</span></p></div>
