        <div> - Zhao Hong&rsquo;s Whereabouts<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Hehe, aren&rsquo;t-aren&rsquo;t I a s-stutterer and un-un-unable to speak properly?&rdquo; Wang Qiang said with a grin.<br>Chu Feng rolled his eyes at Wang Qiang. Chu Feng knew Wang Qiang well. He knew that it was not because Wang Qiang was unable to explain himself properly because of his stutter. Rather, he was deliberately doing that so that Chu Feng would be worried.<br>&ldquo;Enough of that brother. Since you&rsquo;re the perfect vessel and I can help you, I'll definitely do my best to help you,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother, my-my-my fu-future will be i-in your hands,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang. Then, he added, &ldquo;Oh, t-that&rsquo;s right brother, h-how c-come I don&rsquo;t s-see my wi-wife?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are y-you i-in contact w-with her r-right now?&rdquo; asked Wang Qiang.<br>Once Wang Qiang asked those questions, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression immediately became stern. Deep regret bubbled up from the bottom of his heart.<br>Chu Feng naturally knew who Wang Qiang was asking about. It was naturally Zhao Hong, who had arrived in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm with them.<br>Chu Feng had searched for Zhao Hong before. In fact, he had tried quite hard to search for her. Unfortunately, he had been unable to find her whereabouts.<br>&ldquo;W-what&rsquo;s wrong? D-d-di-di-did something happen t-to her?&rdquo; Seeing the difficult expression on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face, Wang Qiang started to panic.<br>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not it. It&rsquo;s just that&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sigh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do you remember how you came to the Void Sacred Tree?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It was w-when we were a-all proceeding to t-the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm f-f-fr-from the Hun-hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that S-stairway to Heaven, y-you were s-swept a-away by that s-st-strange vortex. Later on, I w-was also swept away. Then, I f-found myself in this p-pl-place,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;We were not the only ones that were separated by the vortexes. Seniors Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi, as well as Zhao Hong, were also separated by the vortexes. We were all separated.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Later on, I managed to encounter seniors Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi. However, I haven't been able to find the whereabouts of Zhao Hong the entire time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I don't know where Zhao Hong is, and have not found her,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;T-then, w-where d-did the vortex take y-you?&rdquo; asked Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;I was carried to the Primal Sea Sacred Mountain. It's a place equally as famous as the Void Sacred Tree,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Is t-that a-also a sacred cu-cul-cultivation ground?&rdquo; asked Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;I only stayed there for a very short period of time. Thus, I don't know if it&rsquo;s a sacred cultivation ground. However&hellip; that place was indeed very extraordinary. There should be a lot of treasures and opportunities there. Unfortunately, I did not stay there,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Then w-wh-wh-what about seniors Ying M-mingchao and Zi Xunyi?&rdquo; asked Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Seniors Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi were not split from each other. The two of them both found themselves in a ravine that was extremely rich in natural energies.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;According to them, that ravine should be a sacred cultivation ground,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;In o-other words, it&rsquo;s n-not just me. Rather, a-all four of us were caught by t-the v-vortexes and s-sent to great p-places?&rdquo; asked Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;That seems to be the case,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;If t-that&rsquo;s the case, my w-wife w-w-would most likely be training in a s-sacred cultivation ground. Looking back at it, it w-would appear that the vortexes w-we encountered back then were no catastrophes at all. In-instead, they w-were helping us.&rdquo; said Wang Qiang becoming excited.<br>However, Chu Feng was able to tell that Wang Qiang was pretending to be happy. He knew that Wang Qiang was actually very worried about Zhao Hong. After all, how could he not worry for Zhao Hong when there was no news from her?<br>Merely, Wang Qiang was worried that Chu Feng would feel burdened, and thus decided to say those words so as to not worry him.<br>&ldquo;Brother, I&rsquo;m truly sorry,&rdquo; Chu Feng said apologetically.<br>&ldquo;W-why a-are you apologizing all of a su-sudden?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is it b-because of my wife? Brother, d-don&rsquo;t be foolish, this matter is n-not your fault.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough. S-stop a-acting so emotional l-like a woman.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My w-wife is someone blessed by the heavens. She wi-will definitely be f-fine,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Mn. I actually also feel that she should be fine. After all, the four of us all benefited from the vortexes. There&rsquo;s no reason why she wouldn&rsquo;t benefit too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, before finding her, it&rsquo;s inevitable to worry about her safety,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;T-there&rsquo;s ac-actually no need to deliberately s-seek her out. When it&rsquo;s time, w-we will naturally meet one another.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come, le-let&rsquo;s go. It&rsquo;s ti-time to do pr-proper business.&rdquo;<br>As Wang Qiang spoke, he placed his hand on Chu Feng&rsquo;s shoulder again, and soared into the sky with him again. He brought him back to the place they were at previously.<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were still kneeling on the ground.<br>They were kneeling very orderly, and did not even shift their positions. They truly had not moved in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;Lord Envoy, you&rsquo;ve returned.&rdquo;<br>Seeing Wang Qiang&rsquo;s return, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief immediately called out to him. His tone was not only humble, but it was also filled with respect.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s e-enough, all of y-you can st-stand up.&rdquo;<br>Wang Qiang swung his arm in a very natural manner. It was as if the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were truly his subordinates.<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen expressed their thanks to Wang Qiang, and then got up in succession.<br>Seeing that, even Chu Feng felt Wang Qiang to be very repulsive. He was totally taking advantage of the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted being behind him to bully the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen. After all, those Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen had not done anything that would really offend him.<br>However, the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were still very respectful toward Wang Qiang.<br>From this, it could be seen that the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen were truly loyal to that Qin Kunlun.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell that their reverence for Qin Kunlun was sincere. They were not acting like that purely because they had obtained his inheritance.<br>However, they had no idea that Qin Kunlun had already died, and that the person that they were truly devoted to was the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>That said, that was actually unimportant to them. After all, it was the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted that had given them power.<br>Thus, even if they were to learn the truth, it would not affect their loyalty for the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;I will a-ask y-you all a question,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Lord Envoy, please speak away,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;You all wish to ob-ob-obtain Lord Q-qin Kunlun&rsquo;s i-i-in-inheritance, right? If that&rsquo;s the case, g-give me a re-reason why Lord Qin Kunlun should impart his i-in-inheritance to y-you all,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Lord Envoy, you should know that the true founder of our Blood-devouring Demon Clan is actually Lord Qin Kunlun. Right now, our Blood-devouring Demon Clan has suffered disastrous losses. We need Lord Qin Kunlun&rsquo;s guidance,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;What y-you say is indeed reasonable. However, if t-th-that is all there i-is to it, then I&rsquo;m afraid that w-wouldn&rsquo;t do. It will depend on y-your own a-abilities a-as to w-whether or n-n-not you will be able to re-receive Lord Qin Kunlun&rsquo;s inheritance,&rdquo; after saying those words, Wang Qiang pointed to Zhang Yanfeng, Zhang Shirui and Zhang Boyi.<br>&ldquo;You, you and y-y-you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The t-three of you, st-step forward,&rdquo; said Wang Qiang.<br>If there were people in the Blood-devouring Demon Clan that were unwilling to accept Wang Qiang, then it would be Zhang Yanfeng, Zhang Shirui and Zhang Boyi.<br>However, they knew that they couldn&rsquo;t offend him. Thus, they did not dare to disobey his orders. Not only that, but they would have to act very respectful towards him.<br></p></div>
