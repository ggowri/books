        <h1>Chapter 3676</h1>
        <div> - Mob?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;The debt from the father shall be settled by the son! Hand Chu Feng over! Otherwise, we will trample the Chu Heavenly Clan today!&rdquo;<br>Voices of suppression began to explode nonstop like thunder. One could hear such voices for several miles.<br>The cowardly and craven individuals had all fled in fear of being implicated.<br>As for the daring individuals, they actually got even closer, and concealed themselves to secretly watch.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over, it&rsquo;s over. Never would I have imagined Chu Xuanyuan to have such an effect. I had originally thought that he had become a laughingstock after being imprisoned by the Chu Heavenly Clan. Never did I expect that he was actually still acting as a deterrence for so many people.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Now that Chu Xuanyuan has died, these people that have detested him and the Chu Heavenly Clan have all revealed themselves.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Never would I have expected for there to be this many experts. Exactly how many people did Chu Xuanyuan offend?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lacking knowledge about this matter. The people that Chu Xuanyuan offended back then were either from prestigious families or experts with enormous talent.&rdquo;<br>For the sake of revenge, many of them went into closed-door training. And now, their cultivations have increased greatly. Naturally, it is time for them to retaliate against the Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Regardless, the Chu Heavenly Clan is destined to be doomed today.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the vast army of tens of thousands of experts, the people hiding and observing the situation all felt worried for the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>They felt that they would likely be expunged from the history of the Ancestral Martial Starfield henceforth.<br>&ldquo;That mob dares to stir up trouble in the Chu Heavenly Clan? They are truly overestimating their capabilities.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, at the moment when the majority of the people were thinking that the Chu Heavenly Clan was doomed, a different sort of voice sounded from behind the crowd.<br>Hearing that voice, the crowd&rsquo;s initial response was to shout down that person for being ignorant. However, upon turning around, they discovered that the person who had spoken was not an ordinary individual. Instead, it was someone from the Ghost Sect Hall.<br>Furthermore, that person was emitting an extraordinary aura. The crowd were able to tell from a glance that that person was an expert.<br>&ldquo;And here I was wondering who would say that sort of absurd thing. Turns out, it&rsquo;s actually milord from the Ghost Sect Hall.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, Milord, please look carefully. Those people that came to mount a crusade against the Chu Heavenly Clan are all powerful experts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Many among them are powerful Exalted-level existences. How many Exalted-level experts does the Chu Heavenly Clan have?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, the Chu Heavenly Clan is facing several thousand Exalted-level experts.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The disparity in number is so vast. Anyone with a discerning eye can tell that the Chu Heavenly Clan will undoubtedly be defeated. Thus, why would you, Milord, call them a mob?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Excuse me for saying something unpleasant, but not to mention those Exalted-level experts, even any one of those Martial Immortal-level experts among that vast crowd would be able to defeat Milord, no?&rdquo;<br>The only reason why the crowd were speaking with restraint was because the person who had spoken out against them was from the Ghost Sect Hall. Otherwise, they would&rsquo;ve ridiculed him nonstop.<br>That said, even though they were exercising restraint, the crowd&rsquo;s words were still filled with ridicule.<br>Their behavior was rather understandable. After all, the condition of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was one where peak Martial Immortal experts were top rated experts, and Exalted-level experts were the strongest existences.<br>That said, the majority of the Exalted-level experts in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm were only rank one Exalted.<br>As for the crowd of experts that had gathered outside the Chu Heavenly Clan, the weakest amongst them were peak Martial Immortals. As for the Exalted-level experts, they numbered in the thousands.<br>Although the Chu Heavenly Clan was the overlord of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, there was an enormous disparity, akin to the disparity between a river and the ocean, when compared to the people that had come to crusade against them.<br>To the great majority of the people in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they felt that the massive crusading army composed of experts from all over the Ancestral Martial Starfield was like an army of gods descending upon them.<br>In their eyes, that army was simply not an army of ordinary martial cultivators. Instead, it was an army of gods, an army capable of bringing ruin to the mortals of the world, an army that could not be defeated,<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip; you all do not know the Chu Heavenly Clan well, and still do not know the strength of the master of our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. However, your ignorance is understandable. After all, you all simply possess too little knowledge of such things.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Continue watching. Soon, you will come to understand that the Chu Heavenly Clan is vastly different from before. It is not a power that this mob can bully and humiliate at will.&rdquo;<br>That Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s expert was not angered by the crowd&rsquo;s ridicule.<br>He was someone who had entered the Void Sacred Tree with the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master. Thus, he knew the current cultivation of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>However, as the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had told the crowd to keep the matter of his cultivation confidential, no one had spread news of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s actual cultivation. Naturally, that Ghost Sect Hall expert would not mention that to these people either.<br>Because news of Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s cultivation had not spread, no one who wasn&rsquo;t present at the Void Sacred Tree knew his actual cultivation. The crowd&rsquo;s understanding of the Chu Heavenly Clan was still that of the past.<br>Because of that, the crowd were looking at that Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s expert like he was a fool. They felt that he was delusional, believing in his own lies and refusing to confront the truth.<br>&ldquo;We will ask one more time. Are you going to hand that Chu Feng over or not? If you all still refuse to hand him over, we will become impolite.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, a black-clothed white-haired old man from the crusaders spoke loudly. His voice was akin to thunder, and his attitude very aggressive. He was not trying to talk with the Chu Heavenly Clan. Instead, he seemed like he was giving them an order.<br>That old man was called Blackwind Old Man. Not only did he possess the cultivation of a rank eight Exalted, but he was also rather famous in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>As every group must have a leader, even though those crusaders came from all over the Ancestral Martial Starfield, they still needed someone to lead them.<br>Due to his cultivation, this Blackwind Old Man became the logical leader of the crusaders.<br>&ldquo;Impolite?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I wish to see exactly how you all are going to become impolite.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, I will speak frankly first. If you all are to leave now, our Chu Heavenly Clan is willing to spare you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if you really dare to attack us, there will be no path of regret.&rdquo;<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa spoke loudly. Compared to the others, he showed absolutely no fear facing this group of powerful experts.<br>&ldquo;Look at his cultivation. I can crush trash like him with a single finger. Yet, he actually dares to speak such arrogant words. I see that the Chu Heavenly Clan are full of people that will refuse to shed a tear until they see their coffins.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brothers, since they are unwilling to hand Chu Feng over, do not feel guilt in being ruthless. Today, we shall show them how powerful we are.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Brothers, take down this insufferably arrogant clan of trash! Have them realize what the outcome of opposing us will be!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Kill!!!!!!&rdquo;<br>The Blackwind OId Man commanded. Then, ear-piercing voices shouting &lsquo;Kill!&rsquo; filled the sky.<br>Like an invisible tornado, the ten thousand plus experts all unleashed their oppressive might, engulfing the entire area.<br>Following that, they began to run wildly on the ground and fly rapidly in the sky. In succession, they all charged toward the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br></p></div>
