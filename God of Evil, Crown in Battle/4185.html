        <h1>Chapter 4184</h1>
        <div> - Zi Ling<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, thank you for all the trouble you&rsquo;ve gone through for me.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng became completely relieved upon learning that his clansmen were fine.<br>It was as Fumo Shaoyu had said. If Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t have any worries anymore, he would be a lot more relaxed, and would not have to think about the consequences too much when he did things.<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Here is the location where your clansmen are taking refuge.&rdquo;<br>As Fumo Shaoyu spoke, he handed Chu Feng a small scroll.<br>Chu Feng accepted the scroll and opened it. He discovered that the scroll was actually a map that showed the location of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen had been moved to.<br>Sure enough, the location was a place one would not notice easily.<br>However, when Chu Feng began to think of how all his clansmen had been transferred from their familiar homes to a new place, he began to feel slightly uneasy.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought hardship upon my clansmen,&rdquo; Chu Feng sighed.<br>The current Chu Heavenly Clan was in charge of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>People would most definitely discuss their sudden disappearance.<br>&ldquo;What hardships do they have?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is their honor to have such an outstanding clansman like you,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>Chu Feng looked to the black-haired girl and asked quietly, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. Brother Shaoyu, who is that young lady?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;She seems to know me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, her? She came to find you,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Find me?&rdquo; Chu Feng was very surprised.<br>After all, he didn&rsquo;t know the black-haired girl at all.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. She arrived at your clan and declared that she needed to see you. I saw how urgent she looked, and since I knew where you were, I decided to bring her over.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, she&rsquo;s been acting very mysterious, and has refused to tell me why she&rsquo;s searching for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I had thought that she&rsquo;s some girl that you&rsquo;ve duped. But, judging from how things look now, that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case,&rdquo; Fumo Shaoyu said in a whisper.<br>&ldquo;Of course not. I don&rsquo;t even know her,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Okay, okay. You go talk with her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know why she was searching for you once you ask her.&rdquo;<br>After Fumo Shaoyu finished saying those words, he grabbed Fumo Xin&rsquo;er and left.<br>The siblings were smiling joyously. Their relationship was truly good.<br>As for Chu Feng, he arrived before the black-haired girl.<br>&ldquo;Young lady, do you need something from me?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find a quiet place to talk.&rdquo;<br>As the black-haired girl spoke, she stepped into the sky and began to walk away.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng followed her.<br>The black-haired girl did not walk far. She stopped upon reaching a place without people.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>She raised her arm, and a spirit formation appeared. That spirit formation sealed Chu Feng and her within it.<br>Her spirit power was Saint-level. Furthermore, it was Dragon Mark on top of that.<br>Even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power was being devoured by the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk, his world spiritist&rsquo;s sharp perception remained. He was able to tell that the girl was no ordinary Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist.<br>Her spirit power was extremely strong. It was very possible that she was a world spiritist that had grasped the Dragon Transformation Sensation.<br>Chu Feng was unable to determine her cultivation because it was hidden.<br>But, merely her world spirit techniques were sufficient to leave a profound impression on him.<br>Although the girl appeared rather ordinary, she was someone extraordinary.<br>&ldquo;Let me ask you this again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you really Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You are the Chu Feng that was abandoned by the Chu Heavenly Clan, the Chu Feng that grew up in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm&rsquo;s Nine Provinces Continent&rsquo;s Chu Family?&rdquo; asked the black-haired girl.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me. Young lady, who are you?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>He became more and more curious about the girl.<br>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Yu Ting.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I came here to find you because of an important matter.&rdquo;<br>As Yu Ting spoke, she took out a little bell.<br>It was a little purple bell.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression immediately changed upon seeing the little bell. His emotions were immediately sent into chaos.<br>Excitement and nervousness filled his mind. He became extremely unstable.<br>It was impossible for Chu Feng to not recognize the little bell. That little bell was something that he had formed using his world spirit techniques. It was a gift he had given to Zi Ling.<br>&ldquo;Miss Yu Ting, where did you get that bell?&rdquo; Chu Feng immediately asked upon receiving the little bell.<br>Although he was a very calm person, he was in a complete panic at that moment.<br>Zi Ling was simply too important to Chu Feng.<br>She was the only person besides Her Lady Queen that had truly gone through trials and tribulations with him. She was a woman who had experienced difficulties and dangers with him.<br>However, ever since Chu Feng had first left the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, he had never once seen Zi Ling again.<br>According to the information that was left behind by his father, Chu Feng knew that Zi Ling was still in the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>She had deeply wanted to help Chu Feng. But, her talent was simply too lacking. Thus, even though she was being helped by Chu Feng&rsquo;s father, she still needed to work extra hard.<br>Chu Feng knew that Zi Ling was currently training somewhere. But, he didn&rsquo;t know the details as to where she was.<br>Ever since Chu Feng had left the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, he had never seen Zi Ling again.<br>There was no need to mention the status that she held in Chu feng&rsquo;s heart.<br>Zi Ling was one of the few people capable of causing him to lose his senses.<br>This was especially true now. After hearing some news of Zi Ling after so long, Chu Feng was both excited and nervous.<br>He was excited because he had finally received news about Zi Ling.<br>He was nervous because he didn&rsquo;t know if this news was good or bad.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you are indeed Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Yu Ting had been carefully observing Chu Feng the entire time.<br>From Chu Feng&rsquo;s reaction to the little purple bell, she was able to tell that he cared greatly for Zi Ling.<br>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re Chu Feng, I will speak bluntly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Zi Ling is in trouble,&rdquo; said Yu Ting.<br>&ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng immediately grew nervous upon hearing her words.<br>What he worried about the most was Zi Ling being in trouble.<br>Yet, the thing that he was worried about the most had occurred.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be overly worried either. Whilst this matter needs to be solved, it is not that easy to accomplish.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is no use for you to panic right now.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Yu Ting added, &ldquo;Do you know about the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I know about them.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had inquired about the structure of the Holy Light Galaxy from Long Daozhi.<br>Thus, he knew about the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was one of the strongest powers in the Holy Light Galaxy besides the Holy Light Clan.<br>However, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was rather hidden.<br>It was said that the Hidden Dragon Starfield that the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect existed in was a place that outsiders were unable to enter. Only people from the Holy Light Clan were qualified to pay them a visit.<br>If other people dared to intrude upon their territory, they would kill them without any hesitation.<br>Moreover, the Hidden Dragon Starfield was not only a place with concealment and protection formations, its location was also ever-changing.<br>Very few people knew where it was located.<br>Even if one wanted to trespass, they would not be able to find it.<br>Furthermore, it was impossible to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect. Instead, they would personally select disciples.<br>Only those that they took a fancy to were able to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>As for the people that they took fancy to, they would be taken away by the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect regardless of whether or not they were willing to join them.<br>In short, the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect was a powerful, mysterious and tyrannical power.<br></p></div>
