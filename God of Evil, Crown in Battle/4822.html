        <div>: Invitation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tzlala!<br>All of a sudden, he summoned the Lightning Mark and Lightning Armor simultaneously. At the same time, three-colored lightning appeared beneath his feet too.<br>It was an Exalted Taboo movement skill.<br>With this set of maneuvers, he was planning not to chase after Chu Feng and Zi Ling but to simply shake the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple off.<br>Uwa!<br>But before he could get far, a palm fell on his shoulder, and the next moment, he was pressed down onto the ground.<br>&ldquo;Why are you running all of a sudden? Where did your manners go?&rdquo;<br>Needless to say, the person who stopped him was no other than the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple.<br>&ldquo;I have no grudge with you, so why must you pick on me?&rdquo; Zuoqiu Youyu said indignantly.<br>&ldquo;Hehe!&rdquo;<br>Unexpectedly, the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple suddenly burst into laughter.<br>&ldquo;Do you wish to meet True Essence Exalted before Chu Feng?&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple asked.<br>&ldquo;W-what do you mean?&rdquo; Zuoqiu Youyu asked.<br>&ldquo;I can help you,&rdquo; the Hidden Dragon Chief Disciple said.<br>&hellip;<br>The formations covering True Essence Mountain were powerful and complicated.<br>Reaching the peak was obviously no easy feat, but even the paths around the mountain were fairly complicated too. There were many choices, and every single one of them could potentially reach the peak. It was just that they had varying difficulties, and the distance one had to cover for each path was different.<br>Chu Feng was able to find a road with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes soon enough.<br>He knew that it would be hard for him to find Duan Liufeng just like that, so he was planning to scale the mountain as fast as he could and speak of this matter to True Essence Exalted. He believed that the latter would surely have his means to find Duan Liufeng and save him since he was the one who set up all of these formations.<br>It was just that even looking for a pathway upward was no easy feat. One good example was the invisible barrier that had happened in the midst of Chu Feng&rsquo;s way.<br>This barrier was weird in the sense that it was similar to an illusion. It couldn&rsquo;t be seen or perceived, and one could walk right through it. It was just that if one tried to do so without a second thought, they would immediately lose their chance to scale to the top of the mountain.<br>One would have to decipher the barrier and shatter it in order for the real pathway up to the peak to be revealed.<br>This barrier indubitably posed a huge challenge to most cultivators, but it was no more than a walk in the park for Chu Feng. He was able to decipher the barrier easily.<br>A spirit formation gate appeared before him the moment the barrier was breached.<br>Chu Feng and Zi Ling quickly passed through it and found themselves arriving in the midst of a square. This square wasn&rsquo;t too large, and there were many more spirit formation gates in the area.<br>However, there could only be one exit.<br>If they wanted to continue heading upward, they would have to find the right spirit formation gate.<br>However, the other spirit formation gates weren&rsquo;t meaningless either. They were special tempering formations.<br>There weren&rsquo;t only Chu Feng and Zi Ling in the square right now. Other than them, there were over a hundred other people. They were currently training themselves up in those tempering formations.<br>&ldquo;Is this the reward for successfully entering this area?&rdquo; Zi Ling asked.<br>&ldquo;It should be. Let&rsquo;s give it a try.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was anxious to reach the top, but he knew that it would be unwise to lose sight of what was around him while he was rushing his way forward. These tempering formations could be an opportunity for him to make a breakthrough, so he wanted to give it a try.<br>He stepped into one of the empty tempering formations and sat down. Zi Ling also quickly did the same too.<br>Soon, the power of the formation enveloped Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>He realized that the tempering formation had many effects, but the one that delighted him the most was its ability to enhance his intelligence.<br>It was just a pity that it wasn&rsquo;t sufficient for him to overcome the final seal of the Hidden Dragon Soul Armor. He could have benefited more from the formation if he stayed there for a longer duration, but he didn&rsquo;t have that much time to waste at hand. He needed to hurry on.<br>&ldquo;That lady over here, I&rsquo;m Song Xuxu. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you.&rdquo;<br>But just as Chu Feng was about to leave, a sweet voice suddenly interrupted Chu Feng and Zi Ling&rsquo;s cultivation. He turned his gaze over and saw a beautiful woman standing in front of the formation Chu Feng and Zi Ling were cultivating in.<br>This woman was dressed in a long robe, and there was a token on her waist that wrote &lsquo;Violet Omen Immortal Gazebo&rsquo;.<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but turn his attention to the group behind that woman.<br>There was another tempering formation there, and sitting in it were seven men and two women. They were all dressed in the same clothes as this woman, which showed that they were all from the same power.<br>Chu Feng had long noticed them.<br>He noticed that their gaze had been lingering on them ever since they entered this place. Those seven men had glanced at Zi Ling multiple times now.<br>As a man himself, Chu Feng knew deep well what the nature of their gaze meant.<br>&ldquo;Do you have any business with us?&rdquo; Zi Ling asked.<br>&ldquo;Miss, you&rsquo;re probably here to seek guidance from True Essence Exalted, right? To be frank with you, we have a senior who has been here before. With him guiding our way, we&rsquo;ll definitely be able to meet True Essence Exalted without a hitch. I feel that it&rsquo;s fate that has brought about our meeting, so I wish to invite you to travel together with us.&rdquo;<br>The woman had a smile on her face, and her attitude was polite and earnest, but how could Zi Ling be oblivious to the predatory stares coming from the men behind her?<br>It was clear that they had ulterior motives for inviting her into their group.<br>So, Zi Ling rejected them without any hesitation, &ldquo;Thanks for your kind intention, but I wish to travel along with my future husband.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
