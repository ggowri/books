        <div> - Ridding The Illusions<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;It would seem that little friend Chu Feng has accomplished something impossible again.&rdquo;<br>The conversation between Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi was heard by the crowd. From their conversation, the crowd were able to tell that Chu Feng had accomplished something extraordinary again, something that made even Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi felt disbelief.<br>At this moment, the crowd burst into an uproar. They all began to discuss this matter spiritedly.<br>After all, this was the Unknown Burial Ground that we&rsquo;re talking about here.<br>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Ying Mingchao shouted.<br>Once his shout was heard, the sea of people that were originally extremely noisy immediately quieted down. The only sound that could be heard were the faint rumbles emitted by the grand formation, as well as the rustling sounds of the sand being blown by the wind.<br>After this place quieted down, Ying Mingchao spoke into the pearl that was connected to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s me, Ying Mingchao. How are you right now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, wake up.&rdquo;<br>Ying Mingchao was calling to Chu Feng.<br>At this moment, the crowd finally realized the use of this grand spirit formation.<br>It turned out that not only was this grand spirit formation capable of locking onto Chu Feng and seeing his surroundings, but it was also capable of conversing with Chu Feng.<br>However, after Ying Mingchao called for Chu Feng, the crowd began to grow suspicious as to whether or not this grand spirit formation would be effective in conversing with Chu Feng.<br>After all, Chu Feng was currently lying on his stomach without the slightest reaction.<br>With the situation like this, Ying Mingchao grew even more anxious and uneasy. From this, it could be seen that he was truly concerned for Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety.<br>Ying Mingchao knew that Chu Feng was still alive. Merely, he feared that Chu Feng had been seriously injured.<br>This was precisely what they meant by a confused state of mind from being overly concerned.<br>&ldquo;Judging from the situation, although Chu Feng is seriously injured, there is still no danger to his life yet.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It might be because he has just passed the Soul-extracting Cave that he is not responding to your continued calls,&rdquo; Zi Xunyi said.<br>&ldquo;Xunyi, you&rsquo;re saying that Chu Feng is still within that illusion?&rdquo; Ying Mingchao asked.<br>&ldquo;I am uncertain of that. However, there&rsquo;s that possibility,&rdquo; Zi Xunyi said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, let&rsquo;s wait a bit longer,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao spoke those words very helplessly.<br>After all, apart from waiting for Chu Feng to wake up, there was nothing else they could do.<br>After all, only people below the True Immortal level of cultivation were able to enter the Unknown Burial Ground. Even if they wanted to go in to help Chu Feng, they would not be able to do so.<br>As for the people present that were not True Immortals, they most likely did not possess the capability to reach where Chu Feng had gone.<br>Thus, Chu Feng could only rely on himself. The only thing Ying Mingchao could do would be to wait for Chu Feng to wake up and then communicate with him using the grand formation to advise him on how to pass through the Unknown Burial Ground&rsquo;s grand formation.<br>&hellip;...<br>Actually, Chu Feng had indeed entered an illusion.<br>Mists surrounded him. The mists were crimson red in color. It was an extremely horrifying sight.<br>Chu Feng stood in the bloody mist. He was looking around at his surroundings nonstop. While he was unable to see anyone, he was able to hear loud screams.<br>They were like the wailing of ghosts, the howling of wolves, the roaring of ferocious beasts and the weeping of malicious spirits.<br>In fact, Chu Feng could even hear the sounds of claws scratching.<br>In short, with all these voices together, it was truly horrifying. Even though it was Chu Feng, he still felt his blood run cold upon hearing those voices. He started to feel a chill in his heart.<br>&ldquo;Do you wish to know where this is?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded. That voice was incomparably old. Yet, it possessed exceptional power.<br>Chu Feng opened his mouth with the intention of speaking. Yet, before he could speak, that voice sounded again.<br>&ldquo;You do not need to know where this place is. You merely need to know that you will have to pass through the following formation if you want to live.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What formation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The Life and Death Formation,&rdquo; That voice answered.<br>&ldquo;Is it this place?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not this place. However, it is related to this place. Go on and comprehend things by yourself. Use your heart to do so. Whether you&rsquo;ll live or die will be dependent on you own abilities.&rdquo;<br>After that voice said those words, it disappeared completely.<br>&ldquo;Senior? Senior?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng called out for that voice twice. He wanted to seek the answers to some more questions.<br>However, that voice never answered him again.<br>Chu Feng did not continue to ask that voice. Instead, he sat cross-legged on the ground. He set up a spirit formation and began to attentively listen to the sounds.<br>He had set up the spirit formation to increase his perception and hearing.<br>After Chu Feng&rsquo;s perception and hearing grew stronger, the clamorous and horrifying noises also grew more distinct.<br>From this, Chu Feng was able to tell that the noises were much more complicated than he had originally thought.<br>Not only were there screams, snarls and roars, but there were also sounds from weapons colliding with one another, flames surging about, and water crashing down from high above, as well as the whistling of strong winds...<br>It was as if all of the noises in this world were present in his surroundings. The noises&hellip; seemed to possess some sort of indication.<br>Chu Feng felt that some sort of secret was contained in these noises. As for this secret&hellip; it was very likely the crucial aspect to breaching that so-called Life and Death Formation.<br>After an hour passed, and Chu Feng felt that the noises around him had instantly disappeared.<br>When Chu Feng opened his eyes, he discovered&hellip; that he was lying on the ground.<br>Chu Feng looked around and revealed a surprised expression.<br>Mountains and rocks covered his surroundings. Chu Feng felt as if he were in a vast mountain range.<br>However, fatal danger was all around him.<br>Chu Feng finally realized what Life and Death Formation meant. The place which he was in right now was the Life and Death Formation.<br>&ldquo;Seems like Zhao Hong is in this Life and Death Formation.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng recalled the image of Zhao Hong using her various abilities.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you able to hear my voice?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded in Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>That voice was very strange. It did not sound from outside, but rather within Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>It felt like how Her Lady Queen would converse with Chu Feng. However, this voice was clearly not Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s voice. Chu Feng was able to be certain that it was Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s voice.<br>&ldquo;Senior Ying, is that you?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng looked around. However, not only was he unable to see Ying MIngchao, but he did not even manage to feel Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s aura.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me. Chu Feng, I am currently outside the Unknown Burial Ground. I am using a special spirit formation to communicate with you,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>&ldquo;Spirit formation? Senior&hellip; how did you know that I was here?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt astonished. However, he soon thought of a possibility. Thus, he asked, &ldquo;Could it be&hellip;?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I was told by that person who claims to be your subordinate that you are here,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough,&rdquo; Chu Feng sighed emotionally.<br>He guessed that the guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief had gone to find Ying Mingchao because the journey here had been very difficult.<br>He had been seriously injured, and even his soul had suffered greatly. Although he appeared to be fine right now, Chu Feng had experienced countless torments, and nearly died.<br>Having experienced that many things, the crystal that was linked to his body would have most definitely reacted.<br>The guardian clan&rsquo;s clan chief must&rsquo;ve discovered that the situation was amiss, and went to Ying MIngchao to seek for assistance out of worry for Chu Feng&rsquo;s safety.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll make this brief.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This Unknown Burial Ground is one of the most dangerous remnants in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. It possesses a total of three checkpoints. They are respectively the Gates of Hell, the Soul-extracting Cave and the Life and Death Formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, you are at the Unknown Burial Ground&rsquo;s final checkpoint, the most dangerous checkpoint, the Life and Death Formation,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please don&rsquo;t worry. I have managed to obtain some comprehension from that illusion earlier. As such, this junior will have a chance at breaking through this formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Although he had only listened for an hour, Chu Feng had indeed managed to comprehend a lot of things in that illusion. Although he did not dare to guarantee that he would actually be able to pass through the Life and Death Formation, Chu Feng felt that he would have at least a thirty percent chance of being able to pass through this Life and Death Formation.<br>Although a thirty percent chance was not very high, and could even be said to be a very low level of success, it was already very high when compared to the others that passed through the Life and Death Formation.<br>&ldquo;No, Chu Feng, listen to me. You must absolutely not be affected by that illusion. You must forget all that you&rsquo;ve comprehended in that illusion. Else&hellip; you will definitely die.&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, Ying Mingchao warned Chu Feng in a very serious manner.<br><br></p></div>
