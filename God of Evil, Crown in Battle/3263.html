        <h1>Chapter 3262</h1>
        <div> - Frightened Gazes<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After laughing for some time, Linghu Tiemian looked at Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you are not the most daring person I&rsquo;ve ever met. However, you are most definitely the person with the most exaggerated opinion of his abilities that I&rsquo;ve ever met.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you&rsquo;re insistent on having me act?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the Dongguo Heavenly Clansmen and the Li Heavenly Clansmen were all astonished.<br>As for those people that did not know about Chu Feng&rsquo;s character, some among them were unable to contain themselves, and started laughing.<br>Those were laughters of ridicule. They were ridiculing Chu Feng because they felt that what he had said was truly arrogant.<br>&lsquo;Does he really think that he&rsquo;ll be able to defeat the others from the Linghu Heavenly Clan just because he defeated those in the Holy Spirit Formation of Light?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Evidently, this Chu Feng has no idea how powerful Linghu Tiemian is.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;He is truly courting death.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. Very well, go ahead and do it then. Let me witness how you shall challenge our Linghu Heavenly Clan,&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian let out a ridiculing laugh.<br>&ldquo;Very well, I will satisfy you,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he pointed gently at Linghu Tiemian.<br>A &lsquo;putt&rsquo; was heard. In the next moment, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed. Their faces all turned pale.<br>The reason for that was because that &lsquo;putt&rsquo; sound came from the location where Linghu Tiemian was standing.<br>Linghu Tiemian, who was standing previously, was suddenly lying on his stomach at that moment.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Tiemian, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the other Linghu Heavenly Clansmen beside Linghu Tiemian hurriedly rushed toward him to help him back up.<br>However, no matter how much strength they exerted, they were unable to bring Linghu Tiemian back up.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening? What happened to me?&rdquo;<br>It was not only the bystanders that were confused; Linghu Tiemian himself was also confused.<br>Apart from knowing that he was incapable of controlling his body, Linghu Tiemian had no idea what had happened to him.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng gently pointed in Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s direction again.<br>In the next moment, the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen beside Linghu Tiemian also fell onto their stomachs like he had.<br>A Linghu Heavenly Clansman pointed at Chu Feng and loudly shouted, &ldquo;Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s you who did this?!&rdquo;<br>Hearing that shout, everyone turned their eyes to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I am truly not fond of people that ask questions that they already know the answer to.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, I am even more unfond of people that shout at me.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he narrowed his brows. In the next moment, a scream was heard.<br>That Linghu Heavenly Clansman that had pointed and shouted at Chu Feng was shot flying out and smashed ruthlessly into the plaza&rsquo;s honored guest seats.<br>Rocks were shattered as he landed. As for him, his flesh was completely lacerated.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>witnessing that scene, including the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen, even the Dongguo Heavenly Clansmen and the Li Heavenly Clansmen were stunned. Disbelief filled their eyes.<br>Chu Feng had yet to reveal his aura. However, he seemed to possess the power to control everything. It was not something that could be explained with one&rsquo;s cultivation, as it seemed like everything in that place was under Chu Feng&rsquo;s control.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; exactly what have you done?&rdquo; Someone from the Linghu Heavenly Clan asked. Merely, compared to the person before, that person was no longer shouting. Instead, his voice was trembling with fear.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand? Very well, I&rsquo;ll let you understand.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he waved his sleeve. With that, the spirit formation gate leading to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s main city that was opened by the Linghu Heavenly Clan instantly disappeared.<br>&ldquo;Heavens&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd were all tongue-tied.<br>The reason for that was because the power Chu Feng had unleashed was most definitely not a power that martial cultivators possessed. No matter how powerful a martial cultivator might be, they couldn&rsquo;t possibly erase a spirit formation gate so effortlessly.<br>One must know that that spirit formation gate was created with the power of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s formation core.<br>Right at that moment, Li Anzhi asked with surprise, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve grasped the power of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s main formation?!&rdquo;<br>Hearing Li Anzhi&rsquo;s question, the crowd all realized that Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was emitting a faint light. That light was spirit power. That should be the source of Chu Feng&rsquo;s overwhelming power.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the main formation. However, it is true that I have obtained the power of a spirit formation. As for that spirit formation, it seems to be quite powerful. Right now, I am able to control everything in the entire Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm as my heart desires, including these people.&rdquo;<br>After he said those words, Chu Feng looked to the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen. He said, &ldquo;If I wish it, I can have them die here. Not even the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s grand protective formation will be able to protect them.&rdquo;<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the crowd all turned their eyes to the Linghu Heavenly Clansman that was seriously injured by Chu Feng.<br>As they looked over, frightened expressions filled the crowd&rsquo;s faces.<br>The reason for that was because that Linghu Heavenly Clansman&rsquo;s injuries were still present on his body. They had not healed at all.<br>The Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s grand protective formation was actually ineffective for him.<br>This meant that Chu Feng had truly gained control of an extremely powerful spirit formation, so powerful that he could ignore the grand defensive formation and control everyone&rsquo;s life and death.<br>With the situation being like that, how could the crowd not feel astonished?<br>After all, it was not only the people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan that were present in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm; they too were present in this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>As long as they were there, their lives and deaths would be under Chu Feng&rsquo;s control.<br>&ldquo;Linghu Heavenly Clan, I will give you all a chance. Scram from the Overlord Region right now, and I will let you all live,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to the Linghu Heavenly Clansmen. His attitude was still incomparably arrogant.<br>However, at that moment, not a single person dared to hold him in contempt. Not a single person dared to ridicule him.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng truly controlled everything at that moment, including their lives.<br>In the past, the Linghu Heavenly Clan was the ruler of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>However, Chu Feng was now the god of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br></p></div>
