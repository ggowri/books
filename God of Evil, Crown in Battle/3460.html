        <div> - The Curse From Twenty Thousand Years Ago<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Black-feathered Specter, what is that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Black-feathered Specter? This old man has heard of it before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, wasn&rsquo;t it rumored that the Black-feathered Specter has disappeared for twenty thousand years?&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun looked to Tantai Xing&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct, the Black-feathered Specter has indeed disappeared for twenty thousand years. But that black feather is indeed the Black-feathered Specter&rsquo;s. There is no mistake, because I have seen the Black-feathered Specter&rsquo;s black feathers that my seniors have collected,&rdquo; said Tantai Xing&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Could it be a fake, forged by someone?&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun asked.<br>&ldquo;Senior, it&rsquo;s impossible to forge that black feather. Please, take a closer look&hellip;&rdquo; Tantai Xing&rsquo;er took the black feather from Chu Feng as she spoke and instilled her spirit power into it.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, crimson vein lines appeared on the long black feather.<br>A very intense reek of blood also appeared with the crimson vein lines.<br>The bloody smell was extremely intense. It was as if blood from tens of thousands of individuals had been gathered together.<br>At that moment, the expressions of Chu Feng and the others all changed. As world spiritists, they were all able to that the power on that black feather was extremely extraordinary. It was not something that could be imitated using ordinary methods.<br>Furthermore, apart from the intense reek of blood, there was also another unique aura present on that black feather. It was actually the aura of the Ancient Era.<br>At that moment, everyone present was able to tell that the black feather was no simple thing.<br>&ldquo;Could it really be the reappearance of the Black-feathered Specter?&rdquo; Wuming Xingyun also began to frown.<br>&ldquo;Senior, exactly what is the Black-feathered Specter?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked again.<br>&ldquo;Senior, allow me to explain to young master Chu Feng,&rdquo; said Tantai Xing&rsquo;er.<br>Then, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er began to tell Chu Feng about the Black-feathered Specter...<br>Over twenty thousand years ago, there was an elder in the Tantai Heavenly Clan by the name of Tantai Yanfeng. He, together with his close friends, discovered an Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant. Inside that remnant, they discovered a coffin.<br>Lying in the coffin was a woman. That woman was exceptionally beautiful, much like a celestial fairy. All those that saw the woman would be unable keep themselves from praising her beauty.<br>One should know that, although the people that were able to enter that Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant were not the peak existences of that era&rsquo;s Ancestral Martial Starfield, they were all grand individuals.<br>Yet, even though they were all grand characters that had experienced all sorts of things, they still felt that woman to be the most beautiful woman they&rsquo;d ever seen.<br>That woman should be someone from the Ancient Era. Although she had died for many years, her body remained completely undamaged. In fact, there was even a faint smile on her face. Even though she had died, she had likely died a very peaceful death.<br>As for the reason why the woman&rsquo;s body had not decomposed, it was due to a book that she held in her hands.<br>That book appeared to be composed entirely of jade. Flickering with light, it was capable of maintaining the body of a corpse.<br>It would be one thing if that were the only effect of the book. That book was also covered in ancient characters. Although the characters were very profound and difficult to understand, they contained martial comprehension. Though separated by the crystal coffin, Tantai Yanfeng and his friends were still able to sense how extraordinary that book was.<br>All of them knew that if they were able to comprehend the martial comprehension within the book, their cultivation would definitely increase, strengthening their power.<br>Such a treasure tempted all of them.<br>However, there was a stele before the coffin. That stele was very intimidating at first glance.<br>There were no spirit formation on the stele. There were only several large characters.<br>&lsquo;Those who touch the coffin shall die miserably!!!&rsquo;<br>As they had already experienced many strange things in the remnant, and had also experienced unstoppable powers from the Ancient Era, no one dared to touch the coffin because they were afraid of courting disaster for themselves.<br>However, Tantai Yanfeng was a very bold individual. He ignored the crowd&rsquo;s persuasion, opened the coffin, and took out the book.<br>Although Tantai Yanfeng was very bold, he had his own way of doing things. He knew that the female corpse would definitely be ruined should he take away the book. Thus, he had deliberately prepared a treasure that could maintain corpses, and only took the book away after placing that treasure inside the coffin.<br>However, right after the book left that woman&rsquo;s hands, a strange thing occurred.<br>That female corpse acted as if it has been resurrected. With an ominous glint in her eyes, she opened her mouth wide and let out a terrifying shriek.<br>At the same time as that was happening, the body of that celestial fairy-like beauty began to rapidly rot. Black feathers suddenly began to sprout from her rotting body, covering her completely while continuing to rapidly grow.<br>In the blink of an eye, the beauty that was akin to a celestial fairy had turned into a putrid monster.<br>The scene of what had happened back then was truly horrifying. Even the bold Tantai Yanfeng became extremely afraid. As for others, they were completely terrified.<br>Sensing that the situation had turned bad, the crowd immediately retreated from the remnant.<br>After they escaped from the remnant, that remnant actually began to sink into the earth. The crowd were unable to find any trace of the remnant anymore.<br>It was as if that remnant that had existed since the Ancient Era had disappeared into thin air.<br>Although everyone ended up leaving, they all felt the matter to be very strange, and became very afraid. Even the bold Tantai Yanfeng felt lingering fear from what had happened.<br>In fact, Tantai Yanfeng even went so far as to find a very powerful world spiritist of that era to seek refuge under.<br>Time passed quickly. In the blink of an eye, an entire month had passed, and absolutely nothing happened. Everyone that went into the remnant was completely unscathed. Because of that, Tantai Yanfeng felt that the stele was merely a lie.<br>Because of that, he finally returned to the Tantai Heavenly Clan, took out the jade book, and began training using it.<br>However, on that very night, terrifying screams suddenly resounded throughout the entire Tantai Heavenly Clan.<br>On the second day, Tantai Yanfeng&rsquo;s newborn granddaughter disappeared.<br>The Tantai Heavenly Clansmen searched the entire Tantai Heavenly Clan. Yet, they were unable to find his granddaughter. They only managed to find a black feather in the room where his granddaughter had disappeared.<br>That black feather looked to be very extraordinary. Upon closer inspection, they realized that it was even more extraordinary than it looked. Not only did that black feather contain an ancient era&rsquo;s aura, but it was also filled with a reek of blood.<br>Tantai Yanfeng immediately collapsed upon seeing that black feather. He knew very well that the black feather was the same black feather that had appeared on and covered that female corpse.<br>Furthermore, the terrifying scream that had resounded throughout the Tantai Heavenly Clan sounded very much like the scream from that female corpse.<br>Tantai Yanfeng felt that the female corpse had come to seek him out for vengeance.<br>In the beginning, the people from the Tantai Heavenly Clan didn&rsquo;t believe Tantai Yanfeng. They felt that it was some sort of mischief caused by someone. Some even felt that it might be Tantai Yanfeng&rsquo;s friends that went into the Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant with him wanting to scare him so as to obtain the book he had taken.<br>Because of that, the Tantai Heavenly Clan strengthened their guard.<br>However, on the second night, the same sort of thing happened. This time around, it was Tantai Yanfeng&rsquo;s wife of many years that disappeared.<br>Furthermore, from that day on, terrifying screams would sound in the Tantai Heavenly Clan every night. Following that, a relative of Tantai Yanfeng would disappear.<br>No one knew where the people that disappeared went to. The only thing left on the scene were those strange black feathers.<br>Helpless, the Tantai Heavenly Clan decided to plead for help. They even went as far as to request help from Starfield Master Realm.<br>However, the strongest world spiritists of that era, as well as existences that possessed overwhelming power, were all unable to do anything. They were unable to prevent the kidnappings from happening.<br>Terrifying screams continued to sound every night and, accompanying the feathers that would be present the next day, a Tantai Heavenly Clansman would disappear.<br></p></div>
