        <div><span>: Asura Demon Tower</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? How did Chu Feng enter this phenomenon?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Was he sucked in?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;What the hell is that phenomenon?!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Everything had happened so quickly that the crowd didn&rsquo;t realize that Chu Feng was the one who had dashed into the dark clouds on his own accord. They thought that he was sucked in.</span><br><span>It was only normal for them to think so. The terrifying pressure coming from the sky made those dark clouds look as if they were the entrance to the netherworld. There was no doubt in the crowd&rsquo;s mind that unimaginable dangers were lurking on the other side of the dark clouds.</span><br><span>No one in their right mind would enter on their own accord.</span><br><span>They couldn&rsquo;t understand why Chu Feng was the one who was sucked into the phenomenon, but they didn&rsquo;t think that it was likely for him to survive this ordeal.</span><br><span>In truth, Chu Feng had made the right guess.</span><br><span>The spirit formation gate he had seen on the scroll was indeed located inside this phenomenon, but it was only possible to access it when the image formed by the dark clouds tallied with that on the scroll.</span><br><span>Chu Feng passed through the phenomenon and entered another realm.</span><br><span>He found himself standing in the midst of an ordinary forest with nothing spectacular in sight. The tallest of trees was only ten meters in height, and the flora and fauna were normal plants he had seen during his time at the Nine Provinces Continent.</span><br><span>Having seen all kinds of beautiful sights over the years, he thought that something as ordinary as this felt more comfortable instead.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t disappoint me,&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s voice sounded from the sky. It was the frost woman from the Hidden Land.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, elder. You&rsquo;re starting to frighten me. Is it going to be yet another scroll again?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>The frost woman chuckled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it won&rsquo;t be a scroll this time around.&rdquo;</span><br><span>She raised her hand, and a jar manifested above her palm. The jar had been sealed off by countless talismans, each of them containing an extremely powerful formation. She tore off all of the talismans before hurling the jar onto the ground.</span><br><span>Whoosh!</span><br><span>The jar shattered, and black gaseous flame flooded out.</span><br><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s face paled.</span><br><span>The black gaseous flame was a devastating compounded asura power comprising nineteen different surges of asura powers. As the black gaseous flame dispersed into the surroundings, a humongous black tower manifested out of thin air.</span><br><span>The black tower had eighteen floors in total, and each floor contained a spirit formation </span><span>gate. The black gaseous flame had originated from the black tower. Each floor harnessed a single type of asura power, and the higher one climbed, the stronger the asura power was.</span><br><span>However, what was the most frightening of all was the black tower itself.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Asura Demon Tower?&rdquo; Eggy remarked in unease.</span><br><span>It was rare for her to be unnerved by anything.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The Asura Demon Tower? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Asura Demon Towers are imbued with sealing power. The more floors there are, the stronger the sealing power. An Asura Demon Tower with eighteen floors is bound to have tremendously strong sealing power. On top of that, I can sense an imposing aura on every floor, which means that a demonic beast is sealed on every floor. Chu Feng, you have to know that the demonic beasts sealed in there aren&rsquo;t ordinary creatures. Those are terrifying beings even in our Asura Spirit World,&rdquo; Eggy said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;A demonic beast is sealed on every floor. That explains it&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng had sensed nineteen asura powers inside the tower. There were eighteen demonic beasts inside the Asura Demon Tower, one on each floor, and the tower itself possessed asura power too. That added up to nineteen.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Eggy, is the Asura Demon Tower used for anything else other than sealing demonic beasts? Why do you think the frost woman suddenly brought the tower out?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard of other uses for the Asura Demon Tower other than to seal demonic beasts. I don&rsquo;t have any idea what that frost woman is up to either. Chu Feng, you must not enter the Asura Demon Tower, you hear me?&rdquo; Eggy asked.</span><br><span>She had a bad feeling about the Asura Demon Tower.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with your expression? Are you frightened?&rdquo; the frost woman asked.</span><br><span>She noticed the look of unease on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, what is this tower? Do you intend to have me enter that place?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;This is the final trial. There is a treasure hidden on every floor of that tower. Whatever you can gain out of that tower depends on which floor you dare to challenge. It should be obvious even without me pointing it out, but the higher the floor, the better the treasure,&rdquo; the frost woman said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to her, Chu Feng. You mustn&rsquo;t enter the Asura Demon Tower! You aren&rsquo;t a match for any of the demonic beasts sealed inside there. You&rsquo;ll only be leaping to your own doom!&rdquo; Eggy reminded.</span><br><span>Chu Feng could sense that Eggy wasn&rsquo;t joking around. The Asura Demon Tower must be an extremely dangerous place. Thus, he turned to the frost woman and said, &ldquo;Elder, it wasn&rsquo;t easy for me to get here. I don&rsquo;t know what your aim is, but I have already cleared many of your trials. Shouldn&rsquo;t I get some rewards for that?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s some sense in what you said.&rdquo; The frost woman took a moment to ponder upon Chu Feng&rsquo;s words before continuing on, &ldquo;You came here to cure your world spirit, </span><span>right? I&rsquo;ll give you a hundred Life Crystals as long as you dare to challenge the highest level,&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;A hundred?&rdquo; Chu Feng was astonished.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Too little? A hundred is already enough for your world spirit to make a full recovery,&rdquo; the frost woman said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I mean,&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly clarified.</span><br><span>He had come to this place with the goal of obtaining sufficient Life Crystals to treat Eggy, and before him was a chance to obtain a hundred Life Crystals at once. Naturally, he didn&rsquo;t want to miss out on this opportunity. The problem was that the Asura Demon Tower was a dangerous place. He could sense it himself even if not for Eggy&rsquo;s warning.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, will you give the Life Crystals to me only if I challenge the highest floor?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ll only give you the Life Crystals if you challenge the eighteenth floor. You may leave this place if you don&rsquo;t dare to challenge the tower,&rdquo; the frost woman said.</span><br><span>With a wave of her hand, she manifested a spirit formation gate.</span><br><span>Without any hesitation, Chu Feng stepped forward and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll challenge the highest floor then.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you out of your mind? How could you even think about challenging the eighteenth floor when I told you that you mustn&rsquo;t enter the Asura Demon Tower?&rdquo; Eggy exclaimed in horror.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Shut your trap, lass. You don&rsquo;t know anything about this tower,&rdquo; the frost woman sneered.</span><br><span>Chu Feng and Eggy were stunned. The frost woman could actually hear their conversation!</span><br></p></div>
