        <div> - Yin Zhuanghong&rsquo;s Request<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Lord Shoujian, not even you know what that is?&rdquo; asked the people of the younger generation.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, this old man has no idea what it is,&rdquo; Lord Shoujian smiled and shook his head. Then, he stuffed the scroll-like object into Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s your father&rsquo;s possession, you need to make sure to safekeep it properly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Shoujian, since that is something that my father gave you, this junior cannot accept it,&rdquo; Chu Feng declined.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo; Lord Shoujian suddenly laughed after hearing those words. His laughter was very profound.<br>After laughing for quite some time, Lord Shoujian said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;When speaking of it, I am truly ashamed. This item has been with this old man for quite a few years already. After all, when I received it, your father was even younger than you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless for this old man to keep this item. I&rsquo;ve already had it for many years, yet, I've been unable to determine what it is. Thus, why would I still keep it around?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You, on the other hand, are different. I feel like I&rsquo;m seeing your father when I see you. Never has there been any other person of the younger generation capable of making this old man feel this way,&rdquo; said Lord Shoujian.<br>&ldquo;Senior, we have no objection to your praises for Chu Feng. However, you should consider our feelings too, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Kong Ci and the others voiced their grievances.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo; Lord Shoujian laughed joyously.<br>He did not go out of his way to praise Kong Ci and the others. He also didn&rsquo;t bother to comfort them. This served to prove that Lord Shoujian truly felt that the talent of Kong Ci and the others could not be compared to Chu Feng's.<br>Otherwise, he would not act in such a manner, where he would refuse to even say anything to appease them.<br>That said, Kong Ci and the others were not angry at Lord Shoujian&rsquo;s behavior either. After witnessing Chu Feng&rsquo;s abilities, even they themselves felt that they truly could not be compared to him.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve inherited your father&rsquo;s finest lineage. Thus, whilst this old man might not be able to see through this item, you might be able to. As such, rather than keeping this item here with this old man, it is better that I hand it to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, your father did not owe our Divine Armament Villa anything to begin with. After all, it is up to one&rsquo;s own ability as to what one can obtain from the Divine Armament Cemetery.&rdquo;<br>After hearing what Lord Shoujian said, Chu Feng felt that it was very reasonable. Most importantly, he was slightly interested in the item that had once belonged to his father. On top of that, Lord Shoujian was very serious, and was showing magnificent hospitality. Thus, Chu Feng decided to accept it.<br>&ldquo;In that case, this junior will do as senior says and accept it. Thank you, Lord Shoujian,&rdquo; Chu Feng accepted the scroll as he spoke.<br>After that brief interlude, the banquet continued. Based on how it was in the past, the banquet would last for four hours. After four hours, if anyone wanted to leave, they could choose to leave, and no one would say that they were being disrespectful.<br>Because of that, it could be said that the banquet would&rsquo;ve ended after four hours.<br>From the beginning of the banquet until the end, the people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield were all feeling very joyous.<br>The All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations, on the other hand, looked depressed the entire time. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the sake of respect, if it wasn&rsquo;t for them not wanting others to say that they were sore losers unable to take defeat with grace, they would likely not have participated in the banquet at all, and would have chosen to leave directly instead.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s a rare occasion for you to come here. Thus, you must stay a couple more days.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know this, but this Divine Armament Villa is a very fun place.&rdquo;<br>Although the banquet had ended, Kong Tianhui was grabbing onto Chu Feng and refusing to allow him to leave.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Feng, your mastery of Ancient Era&rsquo;s Cultivator Chess is simply too strong. You should teach me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Teach me too. Teach me too. How did you manage to control such an enormous amount of chess power?&rdquo;<br>Long Ning, Kong Ci and many other women had surrounded Chu Feng. Their faces were all rosy, and they appeared particularly adorable.<br>Due to the alcohol, they&rsquo;d become much bolder. Like Kong Tianhui and the other men, they were actually also grabbing and pulling Chu Feng around.<br>Seeing that, the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s men grew extremely envious. After all, Long Ning and Kong Ci were saintesses in their hearts.<br>That said, although they were envious, they were capable of understanding it too.<br>If they had Chu Feng&rsquo;s capability, they would likely also be able to receive this sort of treatment. Unfortunately, they did not possess his capability.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, an extremely pleasant-sounding yet cold voice was heard. That voice caught everyone&rsquo;s attention.<br>Looking towards the voice, the crowd were all stunned. Especially the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations. They were simply dumbstruck.<br>The reason for that was because the person who had spoken was Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Wearing a red dress, Yin Zhuanghong still appeared as beautiful as before as she stood before him.<br>Yin Zhuanghong was simply too beautiful. Even though Kong Ci, Long Ning and Xian Yun were rare beauties, they lost their splendor in both how they looked and the airs they emitted when compared to Yin Zhuanghong.<br>The contrast was even more obvious when they were standing so closely.<br>That said, at that moment, what the crowd were more concerned about was not who was more beautiful. Instead, they were more concerned about why Yin Zhuanghong, the person deemed as the number one beauty of the All-heaven Starfield, the person who was even icier than Nangong Yifan, would suddenly seek out Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Miss Yin, do you need anything?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I do. Is it possible for us to talk in private?&rdquo; asked Yin Zhuanghong.<br>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Chu Feng immediately got up after hearing those words.<br>Yin Zhuanghong did not start walking toward the outside of the palace. Instead, she began to walk toward the inside of the palace, to an area that contained smaller halls and resting halls where one could chat in private.<br>Chu Feng followed her.<br>Although the others were very curious as to what Yin Zhuanghong wanted to talk to Chu Feng about, they were very tactful, and decided to watch from the sides and not follow to disturb the two of them.<br>Originally, the All-heaven Starfield&rsquo;s younger generations were all getting up from their seats since the banquet had ended, especially Nangong Yifan, who was itching to leave.<br>However, after Yin Zhuanghong invited Chu Feng for a private chat, Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s eyes were filled with shock. His gaze was fixed onto the direction where they had left. He wanted to see exactly what the two of them were chatting about.<br>His sharp gaze was capable of seeing through walls. Naturally, he would be able to see Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong too.<br>He discovered that after Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong walked for a while, they entered a resting hall.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, Chu Feng raised his arm, and a layer of spirit power covered the two of them.<br>It was a concealment formation. Once the concealment formation appeared, not even Nangong Yifan was able to see through it.<br>At that moment, no one was able to see what Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong were doing.<br>&ldquo;That bastard!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Furious, Nangong Yifan smashed his palm down and shattered the desk before him.<br>&ldquo;Nangong Yifan, what are you doing?! Why are you acting like that when you didn&rsquo;t even drink?!&rdquo; Kong Ci shouted angrily.<br>&ldquo;Nangong Yifan, you&rsquo;ll have to compensate us for what you&rsquo;ve destroyed!&rdquo; Kong Tianhui was truly shameless. He actually demanded compensation from Nangong Yifan.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I can compensate you.&rdquo;<br>Nangong Yifan spoke angrily. Then, he turned around and began to walk toward the exit of the palace hall. However, he only took a couple steps before he turned around and sat back down in the chair. He turned his gaze toward the direction where Chu Feng and Yin Zhuanghong were again.<br>At that moment, the crowd were able to see that Nangong Yifan had a deathly pale complexion. He was truly enraged.<br>However, even though he was enraged, Nangong Yifan managed to resist his anger, turned back around and sat back in his seat.<br>Everyone knew that he was acting like that because of Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Seeing Nangong Yifan like that, Kong Tianhui and the others were unable to contain their laughter.<br>Although Nangong Yifan was truly lacking in character, he seemed to be rather infatuated with Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Thus, everyone knew that he was truly enraged at that moment. Unfortunately for him, Kong Tianhui and the others just so happened to enjoy seeing him so enraged.<br>Meanwhile. Inside the resting hall. After Chu Feng created the concealment formation around them, he turned his eyes to Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Chu Feng wanted to ask her what she needed. However, before he could ask, Yin Zhuanghong spoke.<br></p></div>
