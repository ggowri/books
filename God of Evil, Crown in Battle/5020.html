        <h1>Chapter 5019</h1>
        <div>: Pill Dao Immortal Sect<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Master!!!&rdquo;<br>Seeing the Ox-nosed Old Daoist&rsquo;s plight, Chu Feng felt extreme anger.<br>Even though Princess Xiaoxiao and the Ox-nosed Old Daoist were trapped in the prison beyond the spirit formation gate, their conditions were vastly different from each other.<br>Princess Xiaoxiao was still relatively unharmed despite being trapped, but the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was plunged to a black wooden board by 136 formation nails.<br>&ldquo;Ox-nosed- Ah, no no no. I should be calling your Senior Yuankong instead. I am truly impressed by your means. How did you get a prodigy like Chu Feng to become so loyal to you? Look at the rage in his eyes. He looks just like a loyal dog. I must say, I&rsquo;m really envious of you,&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu scoffed.<br>Meanwhile, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist ignored Sima Xiangtu and instead directed a heartened smile at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brat, you sure improved quickly. You have probably surpassed me by now, right?&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist showed not a tinge of nervousness or pain. It was as if this was nothing more than an ordinary reunion with his disciple after a long time.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng felt a stabbing pain in his heart. He wasn&rsquo;t so naive as to believe that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist felt no pain from those formation nails. The latter was only feigning composure.<br>He knew that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist cared a lot about putting up a front, so he didn&rsquo;t cause a fuss. Instead, he directed a smile back at the latter and said, &ldquo;Master, just give me a moment. I&rsquo;ll save you very soon.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng raised his head to look toward the sky. There was nothing there, but he went on and said, &ldquo;Elder, didn&rsquo;t you say that you would help me today? I hope that you can eliminate this man for me.&rdquo;<br>&hellip;<br>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t kill others for your sake, but I can help you save them,&rdquo; a voice sounded from the empty sky above.<br>The Lady of Dao Sea, the Godwish Grandmother, and the others were delighted to hear that. They could tell from the voice that the person in the sky was the Netherworld Envoy.<br>As powerful as Sima Xiangtu was, he was only able to flaunt his strength in front of the Godwish Grandmother and the others. However, the tables would likely be turned if his opponent was the powerful Netherworld Envoy.<br>Following that, a figure descended from the sky.<br>The Netherworld Envoy had disguised himself, but the Godwish Grandmother and the others were still able to identify him through his silhouette.<br>&ldquo;Yin Ren, it looks like you&rsquo;re in trouble today,&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother sneered.<br>&ldquo;It turns out that you have a helper. No wonder you dare to show yourself.&rdquo;<br>Surprisingly, Sima Xiangtu wasn&rsquo;t afraid of the Netherworld Envoy at all.<br>&ldquo;If you know what&rsquo;s better for you, you shouldn&rsquo;t get involved in this matter,&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu told the Netherworld Envoy.<br>&ldquo;If you know what&rsquo;s better for you, you should free those two and leave this place. Don&rsquo;t force my hand.&rdquo;<br>The Netherworld Envoy released his oppressive might right after he said those words. It swept away Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s oppressive might and spirit power, freeing the crowd from their restraints.<br>&ldquo;My gosh, that aura&hellip; Is he a Half-God level cultivator?&rdquo;<br>The crowd was shocked by the prowess displayed by the Netherworld Envoy. They looked at him with eyes filled with deference and admiration.<br>Even though they were all famous figures in the Nine Souls Galaxy, they dared not to pull their weight before a Half-God level cultivator. That was a being at a higher existence than them, a level that they were unlikely to reach even when they were on their deathbed.<br>&ldquo;Half-God level cultivator?&rdquo;<br>Sima Xiangtu&rsquo;s face darkened upon feeling the Netherworld Envoy&rsquo;s oppressive might, but he still showed no hints of fear.<br>&ldquo;May I know if you&rsquo;re the master of Chu Feng and the Godwish Grandmother?&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of your business who I am. I&rsquo;m telling you to get lost. If you don&rsquo;t understand my words, I&rsquo;ll have no choice but to express it physically,&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy said impatiently.<br>&ldquo;Domineering indeed. I&rsquo;d expect no less from a Half-God level cultivator. However, I&rsquo;ll put my word out here today. I&rsquo;ll be taking all of these people away with me today, including you,&rdquo; Sima Xiangtu said.<br>The crowd, including Chu Feng, was surprised to hear those words. It suggested that Sima Xiangtu wasn&rsquo;t afraid of Half-God level cultivators.<br>Could this mean that Sima Xiangtu hadn&rsquo;t revealed his true prowess yet? Or could he be a Half-God level cultivator too?<br>&ldquo;It looks like you don&rsquo;t know your place.&rdquo;<br>The Netherworld Envoy&rsquo;s silhouette suddenly disappeared. Before the crowd could see anything, he was already standing right in front of Sima Xiangtu.<br>&ldquo;That is&hellip;?&rdquo;<br>The crowd froze in shock.<br>Another figure had appeared in front of Sima Xiangtu. It was a middle-aged man with a dashing appearance and a lofty disposition. He had a pair of sharp eyes that made him look imposing.<br>The Netherworld Envoy had intended to strike Sima Xiangtu with a palm strike, but this middle-aged man had blocked his attack.<br>Chu Feng finally understood why Sima Xiangtu wasn&rsquo;t afraid of Half-God level cultivators. It turned out that he had backing behind him too!<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know who this middle-aged man was, but he was dressed in a white robe that made him appear like an immortal descending upon the mortal world. There were words embroidered on his white robe and inscribed on the token he wore around his waist: Pill Dao Immortal Sect.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re from Pill Dao Immortal Sect? What are you doing here?&rdquo; the Netherworld Envoy blurted out.<br>&ldquo;You recognize me? It looks like I can&rsquo;t let you leave this place alive then,&rdquo; the middle-aged man said with a smile, but his eyes flared with murderous intent.<br>He pushed aside the Netherworld Envoy&rsquo;s palm before hurling a punch forward.<br>Boom!<br>There was a loud explosion. Chu Feng and the others were jolted backward.<br>Those who were in the vicinity of the clash, the Godwish Grandmother, the Sagacious Grandmaster, and even Sima Xiangtu, started bleeding from their seven apertures.<br>Mysteriously, both the Netherworld Envoy and the middle-aged man had vanished from sight.<br>Whoosh!<br>Boom!<br>Boom!<br>Boom!<br>However, a series of piercing explosions started echoing from the sky above. The crowd quickly raised their heads and saw the sky covered in golden light and billowing storm clouds. It was a phenomenon caused by the clash between the Netherworld Envoy and the middle-aged man.<br>&ldquo;That fellow is backed by the Pill Dao Immortal Sect. No wonder he&rsquo;s so arrogant!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng noticed that even the usually fearless Shengguang Baimei had a grim look on his face, as if a calamity was going to befall the world.<br>&ldquo;Elder Baimei, what&rsquo;s the background of the Pill Dao Immortal Sect you speak of?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, this is bad news. The Pill Dao Immortal Sect is a sect with countless years of legacy behind it. Even in the Totem Galaxy, it is only second to the overseers of the Totem Galaxy.<br>&ldquo;Let me put it this way. Just like how the Situ World Spiritist Clan is already a behemoth to our Eastern Region, the Pill Dao Immortal Sect is a behemoth to the Situ World Spiritist Clan. It&rsquo;s a power that&rsquo;s renowned throughout the entire world of cultivation!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br></p></div>
