        <h1>Chapter 3036</h1>
        <div> - Like A Demon<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Seeing the current Chu Feng, Luo Xiaofeng&rsquo;s face was covered in fear. She was extremely scared.<br>She was simply even more scared now than when Xu Jialuo was defeated by that Bandit Beast.<br>It was only at that moment that she realized that the young man that she had looked down on was actually such a frightening existence.<br>Seeing the tragic deaths of those Bandit Beasts and the bloodbath that surrounded her, she knew that the young man that she had looked down on was truly someone who viewed killing like the cutting of grass.<br>Before him, even those Bandit Beasts became extremely small and weak, so small and weak that one would feel mercy and pity for them.<br>However, upon thinking of how she had looked down on Chu Feng and insulted him, Luo Xiaofeng felt as if she had provoked someone that she shouldn&rsquo;t have.<br>She felt that she would likely suffer the same fate as those Bandit Beasts, and die here.<br>But&hellip; she didn&rsquo;t want to die so miserably.<br>The others of the Luo Family were also thinking the same thing as Luo Xiaofeng.<br>Of course, this also included Xu Jialuo, who was lying seriously injured on the ground.<br>Earlier, he had considered himself to be a self-proclaimed genius, and looked down on Chu Feng. He had felt that Chu Feng was nothing more than a joke. If it wasn&rsquo;t for him taking Luo Dali into consideration, he would&rsquo;ve already smacked Chu Feng to death.<br>It was only now that he realized that the actual joke was him.<br>At this moment when everyone were looking at Chu Feng with astonishment, panic, happiness or unease, only two people were looking at Chu Feng with pleasantly surprised expressions on their faces.<br>They were Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi, Chu Feng&rsquo;s seniors that had a deep level of friendship with him from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>Even though they were unable to sense Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation, they knew that the great majority of the Bandit Beasts were True Immortals, and that the Bandit Beast that was fighting against Xu Jialuo was even a rank one Heavenly Immortal.<br>Chu Feng instantly massacred all of the Bandit Beasts within their line of sight. This completely displayed how powerful Chu Feng was, and indicated that Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength was at least that of a rank one Heavenly Immortal.<br>But, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi were only separated from Chu Feng for less than two years.<br>Within two years&rsquo; time, Chu Feng had managed to break through from True Immortal to Heavenly Immortal.<br>His speed of progress was simply too frightening. Even though Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi already knew of Chu Feng&rsquo;s demon-level genius, they were still caught off-guard by his enormous speed of progress.<br>That being said, they were also feeling very happy and excited for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Xunyi, you were still worried for Chu Feng earlier. Now, you don&rsquo;t have to worry anymore, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should know that Chu Feng is never one to boast. He said he would obtain justice for us. Thus, he will definitely do it. Haha.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That boy is truly frightening,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao was wild with joy. Although he was incomparably weak, he had regained a lot of his spirit, and was now laughing openly.<br>Seeing Ying Mingchao acting like that, the joy in Zi Xunyi&rsquo;s eyes grew even stronger. In the two years&rsquo; time she had been in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, she had never seen Ying Mingchao laugh like that.<br>&ldquo;Impudent human, you dared to massacre our race! I will dismember your body into ten thousand pieces!&rdquo; Right at that moment, a furious shout was heard. The next moment, over a hundred silhouettes landed outside the grand formation and surrounded Chu Feng.<br>They were all Bandit Beasts, and all Heavenly Immortals. Their leader was a rank three Heavenly Immortal.<br>All those Bandit Beasts were unleashing their auras without any reservation.<br>That was the reason why surging black clouds filled the sky, oppressive might could be felt in the air, and even the earth itself was trembling.<br>It was like demons had descended upon the earth.<br>The people inside the two grand formations were already filled with panic.<br>Even Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi were looking at Chu Feng with worried expressions on their faces.<br>It was not that they did not have confidence in Chu Feng. Rather, the Bandit Beast leading those Bandit Beasts was simply too powerful. His aura made Ying Mingchao and the others feel as if they had landed in hell. Even breathing became difficult.<br>The powerful aura of that Bandit Beast caused everyone to feel that Chu Feng would not be its match.<br>&ldquo;A bunch of animals dare to boast shamelessly before me? All of you, kneel!&rdquo; Chu Feng shouted. The next moment, Chu Feng unleashed overwhelming oppressive might from within his body.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s oppressive might was too powerful. Not only did it disperse the black clouds that had gathered in the sky, but it even forced all of the Bandit Beasts present onto their knees. Even that rank three Heavenly Immortal Bandit Beast was no exception.<br>It was not only the Bandit Beasts that had surrounded him. At that moment, all of the Bandit Beasts in this hideout were forced to their knees or stomachs by Chu Feng&rsquo;s oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, exactly how strong did that boy Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation become? Exactly what did he experience in less than two years?&rdquo; Seeing that even those powerful Bandit Beasts were unable to do anything before Chu Feng, Ying Mingchao, that legendary character of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, was shaking in excitement.<br>At that moment, that rank three Heavenly Immortal Bandit Beast asked with difficulty, &ldquo;Damn it! Exactly who are you? What is your purpose?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who I am is not important. What&rsquo;s important is that all of you shall die,&rdquo; as Chu Feng spoke, coldness flashed through his eyes. Suddenly, the oppressive might that surrounded the hideout suddenly started to change.<br>&ldquo;Eaaahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, miserable screams resounded through the entire hideout.<br>All of the Bandit Beasts that were still alive were rolling on the ground. Their bodies were gradually being torn apart. Unbearable pain filled their entire bodies. Even their souls were gradually being shattered.<br>They were destined to die. Merely, this process of dying was simply too painful, so painful that they were simply unable to tolerate it. To them, this was truly torture.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; you didn&rsquo;t come for the treasure. Who exactly are you? Why&hellip; why would you decide to massacre our race from the very start?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why, why are you doing this?&rdquo;<br>That rank three Heavenly Immortal bandit beast was also enduring the pain of his body being torn apart and his soul being shattered.<br>However, he was feeling extremely unreconciled. The reason for that was because he felt that Chu Feng did not come for the treasures. Otherwise, he would have asked them about the treasures, and not decide to massacre them from the very start.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking me why?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Feng laughed. His laughter was very frightening, very cold.<br>&ldquo;Since you want to know, I will have you die with this knowledge.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why you Bandit Beasts will be massacred today is because you all have captured people that you shouldn&rsquo;t have.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng pointed toward one of the grand formations below.<br>He was pointing to where Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi stood.<br><br><br></p></div>
