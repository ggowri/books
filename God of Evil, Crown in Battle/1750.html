        <h1>Chapter 1749</h1>
        <div> - Sacred Land For Cultivation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>After Chu Feng put the blue bow and golden arrows away, he looked to Long Lin and asked, &ldquo;This bow and these arrows are mine now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They can be said to be yours,&rdquo; Long Lin said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;While they are rare treasures, I will not thank you for them unless you are to release Yao&rsquo;er,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I will release Yao&rsquo;er on the premise that you become a Martial Emperor,&rdquo; Long Lin said with a beaming smile.<br>Chu Feng looked to Yao&rsquo;er and said, &ldquo;Yao&rsquo;er, wait for my return. Next time, I will definitely bring you away.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Yao&rsquo;er did not say much and only nodded her head while smiling. Even though she had not known Chu Feng for long, she trusted him enormously.<br>Seeing Yao&rsquo;er&rsquo;s smile, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart felt taut. After all&hellip; it was extremely obvious that she was forcing herself to smile.<br>Yao&rsquo;er was only smiling this brilliantly because she was afraid that Chu Feng would be worried about her.<br>Afterward, Chu Feng did not continue to linger. Instead, he turned around and quickly left. He felt that the longer he stayed here, the sadder Yao&rsquo;er would feel. Thus, it would be better for him to disappear sooner.<br>When Chu Feng had completely left the treasure deposit, left Long Lin&rsquo;s line of sight, Chu Feng was unable to contain himself and heaved a long sigh. It was as if he had finally managed to relax after enduring for a very long time.<br>Seeing Chu Feng acting like this, Baili Xuankong asked worriedly, &ldquo;Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled and shook his head. Then, he looked to his Cosmos Sack. A faint joy flashed through his eyes.<br>The reason why he felt this sort of relief was because Chu Feng had been worried the entire time, that the three purple flame arrows in his Cosmos Sack would be discovered by Long Lin.<br>Although Long Lin had already bestowed the blue bow and the golden arrows to him, Chu Feng could not guarantee that he would be willing to gift the three purple flame arrows to him too.<br>After all, these purple flame arrows were extremely powerful. If the ten golden arrows were capable of killing rank one Martial Emperors when used together with the blue bow, the three purple flame arrows, when used with the blue bow, would be able to kill rank two Martial Emperors.<br>To Chu Feng, they were extremely effective killing weapons.<br>After all, no one would be able to guess that Chu Feng, with his cultivation, would have the ability to kill rank two Martial Emperors. After all, there had never been such a treasure in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>At the very least, Chu Feng had never seen anyone possessing this sort of treasure.<br>&ldquo;Although that Long Lin is despicable, the way I see it, he most definitely has something that he wishes to request that you do. Else, he would not have gone through all this trouble.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, in this period of time, he will not do anything to Yao&rsquo;er. Therefore, you do not have to worry too much,&rdquo; Baili Xuankong thought that Chu Feng was worried about Yao&rsquo;er, and thus spoke to console him.<br>&ldquo;Ancestor, please rest assured. Although I am worried about Yao&rsquo;er, I will not blame myself. I had already done all that I should do earlier. As for the things I have yet to do, I will do them in the future.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng nodded his head with a smile. While he was worried about Yao&rsquo;er, he knew that worrying for her like this would be useless. Rather than worrying about her, it would be better for him to put forth more effort to search for cultivation resources to increase his cultivation so that he could bring Yao&rsquo;er out sooner.<br>&ldquo;Good, I like your mentality,&rdquo; Baili Xuankong nodded in admiration.<br>Only by being able to meet gains or losses with equanimity could one be considered to be a true man. While these words might sound simple, they were things that many people failed to do. Yet, Chu Feng, although very young, was already capable of accomplishing such a feat.<br>This made Baili Xuankong feel extremely gratified. However, before they left, Baili Xuankong was still unable to contain himself. He turned around, took a glance at the treasure deposit, and sighed, &ldquo;Truly, never would I have expected such a monster to be hidden in our Cyanwood Mountain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Baili, could it be that he&rsquo;s an existence from the Ancient Era?&rdquo; Dugu Xingfeng asked.<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, it is very possible that he&rsquo;s the true body of that giant tree. The branches and leaves of that giant tree are dragon horns. Its bark was covered with scales. That man&rsquo;s name just so happened to be Long Lin. No matter how I see it, they are definitely related. [1. Long Lin &rarr; Dragon Scale.]<br>&ldquo;Only he will know exactly what he is. What I&rsquo;m concerned about is not what he is. Rather, with how powerful he is, why does he need Chu Feng&rsquo;s assistance?&rdquo; As Baili Xuankong said those words, he looked to Chu Feng.<br>Faintly, he began to feel worried again. He was afraid that Chu Feng would be exploited by that Long Lin. However, there was nothing he could do about it.<br>&ldquo;After I become a Martial Emperor, we might get to know his intentions.&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a light smile. His smile was very at ease. There was not the slightest trace of burden in his smile. It was as if he had not placed this matter in his heart at all.<br>The reason why Chu Feng was acting this way was because he was afraid that Baili Xuankong and the others would be worried for him.<br>&ldquo;With your talent, it would naturally not be difficult for you to become a Martial Emperor. Merely, the cultivation resources you&rsquo;d require would not be that easy to obtain,&rdquo; Baili Xuankong sighed.<br>The cultivation resources Chu Feng needed had became more and more frightening. He had observed all this with his own eyes. If this were to continue, the cultivation resources in the Holy Land of Martialism that would be able to satisfy Chu Feng would become fewer and fewer.<br>Likely, only the cultivation treasures from the Ancient Era would be useful to Chu Feng. However, those things were usually hidden in forbidden areas and Ancient Era&rsquo;s Remnants.<br>As for those places, even with his cultivation, Baili Xuankong would still not dare to trespass into them. Thus, he was worried.<br>&ldquo;Speaking of this, Chu Feng, you have truly broadened our horizons. It is the first time in my life that I&rsquo;ve seen such a ferocious cultivation method.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly what sort of power do you possess? Could it really be an Inherited Bloodline above that of Imperial Bloodlines?&rdquo; Yin Chengkong asked curiously.<br>Before Chu Feng could respond, Baili Xuankong said in a very serious manner, &ldquo;Regarding this, you all must not tell anyone. You must absolutely keep this a secret. Got it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; Yin Chengkong and the others all nodded. None of them dared to disobey Baili Xuankong.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let&rsquo;s return. I am unable to feel free from anxiety by staying here.&rdquo;<br>Baili Xuankong said to Chu Feng. They had only been able to arrive here safely because of Chu Feng. Thus, they would have to rely on Chu Feng to return safely.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded and then began to lead the four of them into the frightening Ancient Era&rsquo;s killing formation.<br>To others, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s killing formation was a danger spot. However, to Chu Feng, this was more like a passageway. He did not think much of it at all.<br>As they looked to the calm and collected Chu Feng leading the way before them, Dugu Xingfeng and the others all felt inferior. Even though they had managed to pass through the Ancient Era&rsquo;s killing formation once, they were still extremely nervous and scared to enter it again.<br>At this very moment, inside that treasure deposit, Yao&rsquo;er was still standing there and looking in the direction where Chu Feng and the others had left motionlessly.<br>At this moment, the smile on Yao&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face was completely gone. Tears were spinning about in her eyes. She was resisting and forcing herself to not cry.<br>Grief, reluctance and loneliness. These feelings were all pressing down on her heart.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to be sad about? It&rsquo;s not like you won&rsquo;t see him again. Rest assured, with that brat&rsquo;s talent, it will not be hard for him to become a Martial Emperor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, I did not place a time limit on him this time. Thus, sooner or later, he will return for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Instead of feeling sentimental here, it would be better if you seized the moment and properly trained. Compared to him, time is even more valuable for you,&rdquo; Long Lin said.<br>&ldquo;Will you really release me next time?&rdquo; Yao&rsquo;er asked. After what had happened, Yao&rsquo;er no longer trusted Long Lin.<br>&ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;re willing to leave, I will naturally let you go. Merely, are you really willing to leave?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You were stuck at rank one Martial Emperor level for a very long time. Yet, you&rsquo;ve been here for only a short year and are already on the verge of reaching a breakthrough. You should know who has helped you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To you, this place is a sacred land for cultivation. Furthermore, I just so happen to be willing to help you. This might be the greatest opportunity of your lifetime. Are you really willing to part with it?&rdquo; Long Lin asked with his eyes narrowed into a smile.<br></p></div>
