        <h1>Chapter 959</h1>
        <div> - The Attack from a Great Enemy<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>However, no one noticed, when the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans were fighting back the army of ten million of unknown origin, the First Immortal, as the core battle strength of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, had quietly left the marriage area.<br>He, at that moment, had come into the Misty Peak, and had arrived atop a very important peak. It was the area that held the Mysterious Technique Stone Tablet. Moreover, he was not alone&mdash;Chu Feng had also been brought up with him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, go. I will guard this place for you. Unless the master or ancestor comes, no one should even think of disturbing you,&rdquo; the First Immortal said gravely after opening the Spirit Formation with the key.<br>&ldquo;Senior First Immortal, didn&rsquo;t you say you wouldn&rsquo;t do anything to the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago? What&rsquo;s with the change of heart?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng glanced at the two unconscious people by the First Immortal&rsquo;s side. They were elders from the Immortal Execution Archipelago, and were responsible for guarding this place. However, they were knocked out just now.<br>&ldquo;I do not like Jiang Qisha&rsquo;s complete arrogance, his tyrannical attitude, and his absolute disregard for everyone else. I&rsquo;m even looking forward to you cultivating this Immortal Transference Mysterious Technique and giving that bastard a good lesson,&rdquo; the First Immortal said with a faint smile.<br>&ldquo;Senior, don&rsquo;t worry. When I finish, I&rsquo;ll definitely make Jiang Qisha pay the price for his actions.&rdquo; After speaking, Chu Feng stepped into the Spirit Formation gate and walked towards the stone tablet on the peak.<br>Although he had been within the Misty Peak, he heard every single one of Jiang Qisha&rsquo;s words outside.<br>It was one thing humiliating him, but Jiang Qisha dared to speak that to Zi Ling. Bloodlust was already surging within Chu Feng&rsquo;s body. His fury was rampaging. His spew of words was unforgivable.<br>*boom boom boom boom&mdash;*<br>Simply no one knew about Chu Feng arriving at the stone tablet within the Misty Peak, because the army outside was truly never-ending. The Immortal Execution Archipelago could not finish killing them.<br>Even as time elapsed, after countless battles, the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans started feeling a bit exhausted. With just a bit of carelessness, they would be destroyed.<br>After everything that had happened, there were already quite a few people injured. Some had died without even leaving a corpse behind.<br>The army of ten million would always end up in defeat after every battle, and on the Immortal Execution Archipelago&rsquo;s side, there were very few injuries. It was absolutely disproportionate.<br>However, there was a limited number of people on the Immortal Execution Archipelago&rsquo;s side. Even if there were even fewer people who were wounded during the battle, the numbers accumulated. After many battles, a thousand people had died, and several tens of thousands of people were injured.<br>&ldquo;Dammit, what are these things? Why do they never end? Who&rsquo;s the leader of them?&rdquo;<br>The Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans all panicked. They knew this would not work if they continued this way. Not to mention insignificant people like them, even some Martial Kings would eventually not hold out.<br>As the proverbs said, &ldquo;Dripping water can still pierce through stone.&rdquo; Yet this was an endless army of ten million that was a gathering of Martial Lords and Martial Kings! Even if they were even stronger, they would not survive if the current circumstances went unchanged.<br>&ldquo;This is too terrifying. These things simply do not die. The Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans&rsquo; side will lose if this goes on.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens! If you ask me, the person who spoke before was likely a part of Chu Feng&rsquo;s group. In a while, if the Immortal Execution Archipelago falls, won&rsquo;t we follow them as well since we had insulted Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Not only did the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago feel danger, even those observing who had spoken quite poorly of Chu Feng felt they were in peril as well.<br>They truly felt the extremes of fear. Those who had spoken scornfully regarding Chu Feng trembled. There were even a few whose<br>root of life<br>quivered once before they soaked their pants.<br>&ldquo;Hoh, Murong Mingtian, you&rsquo;ve truly gone foolish from age. All of them are created by a formation. Of course it will be ceaseless if you fight them like this.&rdquo; The silent Jiang Qisha suddenly spoke.<br>&ldquo;Created by a formation? What sort of formation can produce such realistic lives? Could it be&hellip; that witch has come?&rdquo; Murong Mingtian only thought of that then.<br>Actually, he had suspected whether these endless lives were created from a formation, but he had never seen a formation like that within the Eastern Sea Region.<br>On the other hand, Jiang Qisha had seen similar techniques. So, Murong Mingtian felt if they were truly made by a formation, it wouldn&rsquo;t be one from the Eastern Sea Region, but from the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain on that, but no matter who it is, just find the source and remove it.&rdquo; Jiang Qisha lightly smiled, then spread open his palms. A special talisman appeared within his hand, and then he threw it towards the army of ten million.<br>&ldquo;Scatter!&rdquo; Someone realized it was something bad as he saw it flying over. He hurriedly yelled as a warning, wanting to disperse everyone.<br>But, it was still too late&hellip;<br>*jii jii jii&mdash;*<br>The talisman was too quick; it passed through several people&rsquo;s bodies, and after piercing through the crowd, the talisman became an odd fish several meters long with runes all over its body.<br>Immediately after it appeared, it flipped and rushed directly into the sea. Like light, it disappeared instantly.<br>Afterwards, the army of ten million was very quickly destroyed by Murong Mingtian and the others again. But the strangest thing was this time, the army hadn&rsquo;t reappeared for a very long time.<br>Murong Mingtian&rsquo;s eyes glittered. He couldn&rsquo;t help turning his head to look at Jiang Qisha.<br>Everyone also cast their gazes at him. They knew the army wouldn&rsquo;t have vanished for no reason. Jiang Qisha must have done something.<br>At that moment, he was standing in the air with his eyes closed. The hands held in front of his chest were endlessly changing in gesture. They were changing position so fast no one could even see it what sort of technique he was doing. However, what one could see were layers and layers of shock waves visible by the naked eye were continuously brimming out of his body like a violent gale.<br>*BOOM&mdash;* Suddenly, a huge explosion rang out in the distant sea. Jiang Qisha&rsquo;s eyes also slowly widened, and he said with a mocking smile, &ldquo;A bunch of useless people want to fight<br>me<br>?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You found them? Who is it?&rdquo; Murong Mingtian quickly asked.<br>&ldquo;The formation is already broken. If they dare to come again, they would have to come with their own bodies. However, with their tiny bit of strength, they wouldn&rsquo;t dare,&rdquo; Jiang Qisha said disdainfully.<br>&ldquo;Where? Where are they?&rdquo; Murong Mingtian furiously asked. After being troubled for so long, he was full of anger. He wanted to completely kill them all and slice up their corpses.<br>&ldquo;No rush. They are useless. They can be taken care of at any moment, so leave some strength behind to deal with the real enemy,&rdquo; Jiang Qisha said with a faint smile.<br>&ldquo;Real enemy?&rdquo; The crowd was taken aback. They didn&rsquo;t understand.<br>As for Jiang Qisha, he said quite calmly, &ldquo;Tantai Xue, since you&rsquo;re here, why not show yourself?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
