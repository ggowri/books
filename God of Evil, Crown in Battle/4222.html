        <div> - Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying that, Grandmaster Tang Chen added, &ldquo;That includes your master Zhuge Yuankong. Oh, that&rsquo;s right, he&rsquo;s called Ox-nose now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even senior Ox-nose paid enormous attention to it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No wonder&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The Ox-nosed Old Daoist had a very high status in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart.<br>Especially after Chu Feng learned that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist used to be the strongest world spiritist in the Holy Light Galaxy, his respect for him had increased greatly.<br>For an existence of that caliber to be willing to help someone as weak as him, what sort of grace was this?<br>At the same time, Chu Feng felt very sorry for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this junior has heard about what happened to senior Ox-nose back then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I still have some questions.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This junior wanted to know if senior Ox-nose was truly not a match for that Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, or if he was done in by his friend?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng wanted to know the truth.<br>If the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was weaker than the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, there would be nothing to say. But, if he had truly been stabbed in the back by his close friend, it would mean that the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted had had an unfair advantage in their match. Should that be the case, Chu Feng wasn't going to let the matter be.<br>After all, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had shown him grace.<br>Whilst Chu Feng did not acknowledge him as his master, Chu Feng felt respect for the Ox-nosed Old Daoist from the bottom of his heart.<br>If the Ox-nosed Old Daoist had truly suffered injustice, Chu Feng would definitely obtain justice for him.<br>Even if it was the all-powerful Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, Chu Feng still would not let him get away with it.<br>&ldquo;Although that old codger Ox-nose is a frivolous fellow, there&rsquo;s no need to doubt how powerful he is.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could that Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted possibly defeat him?&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Thus, senior Ox-nose was truly done in by his friend back then?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Mn. That rumor is the truth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sima Xiangtu had joined hands with the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted to plot against Ox-nose.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;By the time Ox-nose discovered that he had been plotted against, it was already too late. He knew that Sima Xiangtu and the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted would not spare him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, he &lsquo;committed suicide&rsquo; to escape the calamity.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although his &lsquo;suicide&rsquo; was committed through a spirit formation, it ended up greatly damaging his vigor, and severely reversing both his martial cultivation and the power of his world spirit techniques.&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen grew sentimental as he said those words.<br>As for Chu Feng, his heart raged with anger.<br>To be stabbed in the back by one&rsquo;s close friend, that sort of experience was most definitely very painful.<br>&ldquo;Senior, do you know where that Sima Xiangtu is?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>The Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted was in the Holy Light Galaxy. If Chu Feng wanted to avenge the Ox-nosed Old Daoist, he would be able to seek out the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted once he gained sufficient power.<br>As for Sima Xiangtu, since Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know his whereabouts, he would not know where to find him for revenge.<br>Furthermore, compared to the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, Sima Xiangtu was even more abominable.<br>&ldquo;No one knows his whereabouts. Ox-nose has been searching for him the entire time since. Yet, he has never been able to find him,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Senior, in that case, do you know where senior Ox-nose is right now?&rdquo; asked Chu feng.<br>He wanted to find the Ox-nosed Old Daoist because he needed to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to rescue Zi Ling.<br>&ldquo;That old thing&rsquo;s whereabouts are ever-changing. Unless he comes to find me, even I will not be able to find him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain is about to open. That old thing will definitely go there. If you want to meet up with him, you can accompany us to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Speaking of it, you have quite a heaven-defying talent, little brat. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll be able to gain some enlightenment inside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Senior, exactly what is the inheritance inside the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng had only learned that it was an inheritance that would aid world spiritists. However, he had no idea who had left the inheritance, as well as what it was.<br>&ldquo;No one knows. However, the things in that place will definitely not disappoint you,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>Since the Ox-nosed Old Daoist would be going there, Chu Feng would have to proceed for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain even if he didn&rsquo;t want to go there.<br>Since he had to go there anyways, he felt that he might as well experience exactly what was hidden in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng thought of another question.<br>It was regarding the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk.<br>Chu Feng already knew that the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk had come from the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect.<br>The Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk was also very powerful. It was a treasure that could only be encountered, and not sought after.<br>But, the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk was only one of the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect&rsquo;s Ten Great Sect-protection Treasures.<br>This meant that the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Scared Sect possessed other treasures on par with the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk.<br>Chu Feng knew that a power like the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect couldn&rsquo;t possibly be unknown.<br>Yet, among all the top powers in the Holy Light Galaxy, there was no sign of the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng very much wanted to know what had happened to the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect, whether it had fallen in power or had ceased to exist.<br>Thus, Chu Feng turned to ask Grandmaster Tang Chen, &ldquo;Senior, do you know about the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect?&rdquo; Grandmaster Tang Chen&rsquo;s expression changed upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;Never would I imagine young friend Chu Feng to be this knowledgeable, to actually know about the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this junior actually doesn&rsquo;t possess any knowledge about the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ve obtained a treasure that came from them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I wanted to learn more about it,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;A treasure from the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, are you serious?&rdquo;<br>Grandmaster Tang Chen revealed a marvelous expression upon hearing those words, so much so that disbelief was present in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;This junior wouldn&rsquo;t dare lie to senior,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What treasure might it be? Is it possible to let this old man have a look?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he took out the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk and handed it to Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>After Grandmaster Tang Chen received the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk, he began to carefully examine it. He even used world spirit techniques to examine it.<br>&ldquo;This is indeed a rarely seen treasure. But, how are you certain that this is from the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;When this junior gained control over this treasure, it informed me of its origins,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If this treasure is truly from the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect, it's worth might be superior to even the inheritance from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Spirit Domain,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng realized that he seemed to have underestimated the might of the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect. Unable to contain his curiosity, Chu Feng asked, &ldquo;Senior, do you know exactly what sort of power the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect was?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, have you heard of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?&rdquo; asked Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt his heart shake upon hearing those words.<br>An uncontrollable emotion surged forth.<br>How could Chu Feng not know what sort of place the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was?<br>That was the power that his mother belonged to, the power that his mother was imprisoned in.<br>Whilst Chu Feng was containing his emotions, Grandmaster Tang Chen thought that Chu Feng didn't know about the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, and began to tell him who they were.<br>&ldquo;The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is located in the Seven Realms Galaxy. They are the most powerful world spiritist power in the current martial cultivation world,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what sort of relationship does the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect have with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>He was clearly asking about the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect. Yet, Grandmaster Tang Chen had brought up the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Chu Feng knew that there must be some sort of relationship between the two.<br>It might even be possible that the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect was a subsidiary power to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.<br>&ldquo;The Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect was also a power that gathered numerous powerful world spiritists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect was also extremely powerful. Their name had once shook the entire martial cultivation world.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back then, they had been an existence on par with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Tang Chen.<br></p></div>
