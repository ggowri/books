        <h1>Chapter 5257</h1>
        <div>: The Strongest Junior<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, Long Chengyu is currently the strongest junior prodigy in the Totem Galaxy, as well as a young master of the Totem Dragon Clan. His name is known throughout the vast world of cultivation,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao said with a respectful tone despite having never met the other party before.<br>It couldn&rsquo;t be helped since the other party was far beyond her caliber despite being fellow juniors, making it seem as if they lived in two different worlds.<br>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;<br>While Chu Feng had been in the True Dragon Starfield for some time now, the conversations he had overheard on the streets were dominantly about him. Due to that, he remained oblivious to the current state of affairs in the Totem Galaxy.<br>&ldquo;How strong is Long Chengyu?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Even if he was currently weaker than Long Chengyu, he was confident that he would soon catch up with the latter&rsquo;s footsteps. Perhaps, the latter might just become his rival.<br>&ldquo;Long Chengyu was at rank three Half-God level before he went into closed-door training. Considering how news has spread that he&rsquo;ll be attending the Trial of the Strongest, he should have come out of his closed-door training by now. I reckon that he should be at rank four Half-God level right now,&rdquo; Cheng Tianchan said.<br>&ldquo;How can you be so confident that a rank four Half-God level cultivator will emerge victorious in the early Half-God level category?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>After all, there were bound to be rank five Half-God level participants in the tournament too.<br>&ldquo;Long Chengyu is more than a match for rank five Half-God level cultivators even when he&rsquo;s only at rank four himself. That&rsquo;s exactly why he&rsquo;s known as the strongest junior prodigy of the Northern Region.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Cough cough&hellip;&rdquo; Cheng Tianchan suddenly coughed. &ldquo;Second Junior, that&rsquo;s over the top. Long Chengyu is indeed the strongest junior prodigy in the Totem Galaxy, but if we&rsquo;re talking about the entire Northern Region,<br>that person<br>from the Immortal Sea Galaxy is more worthy of that title. We might be from the Totem Galaxy too, but we can&rsquo;t deny that Long Chengyu has lost to him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;First Senior, Long Chengyu might have fallen in defeat back then, but he&rsquo;s bound to have grown much stronger after being in closed-door training for so long. I trust that he&rsquo;ll be able to defeat that person from the Immortal Seat Galaxy now,&rdquo; Zhao Yunmo said confidently.<br>&ldquo;I hope so too. I wouldn&rsquo;t want others to think that our Totem Galaxy is the weaker one of the two galaxies in the Northern Region,&rdquo; Cheng Tianchan said with a sigh.<br>His deflated tone suggested that he didn&rsquo;t have much confidence in Long Chengyu.<br>&ldquo;May I know who is that person from the Immortal Sea Galaxy you&rsquo;re speaking of?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, have you heard of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan?&rdquo; Cheng Tianchan asked.<br>&ldquo;I have heard of them,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;The person I&rsquo;m referring to is Xianhai Shaoyu, a young master from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. He&rsquo;s the strongest junior prodigy of the Southern Region, having once defeated Long Chengyu in battle,&rdquo; Cheng Tianchan said.<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t surprised to hear that name. If anything, he had expected it.<br>&ldquo;Is the cultivation of the young master of the Immortal Sea Fish Clan above Long Chengyu?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how strong he is now, but the two of them were at rank three Half-God level when they fought back then,&rdquo; Cheng Tianchan replied.<br>&ldquo;They were of the same cultivation level?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured. &ldquo;Brother Shaoyu sure is remarkable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Speaking of which, we&rsquo;re quite close to the Immortal Sea Galaxy now. Should we pay a visit to Little Fishy? It has been a while since we last met. That little brat should have matured into a ravishing lady by now,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;We should. Let&rsquo;s head there after I&rsquo;m done dealing with the Situ World Spiritist Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;You can visit them first before dealing with the Situ World Spiritist Clan. You should be able to access the Immortal Sea Fish Clan freely with the token Xianhai Shaoyu gave you anyway,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, are you trying to get me to engage Brother Shaoyu&rsquo;s help in dealing with the Situ World Spiritist Clan?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that&hellip; though I doubt that he&rsquo;d turn a blind eye to the predicament you&rsquo;re in,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;I know that they&rsquo;ll help me if I ask them for help, but I don&rsquo;t want to do that. I want to exact this vengeance with my own hands,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Fine. Treat it as if I didn&rsquo;t say anything. It&rsquo;s not as if you would ever ask Xianhai Shaoyu and Little Fishy for help anyway,&rdquo; Eggy scoffed.<br>&ldquo;What do you say that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;How long have I known you for? Your pride is so high that you&rsquo;d rather suffer than to rely on others,&rdquo; Eggy scoffed.<br>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m only doing this because of you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of me?&rdquo; Eggy was baffled.<br>&ldquo;How can I be worthy of someone as powerful as Milady Queen if I have to rely on others to solve my problems?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Well, I guess that makes sense too,&rdquo; Eggy replied with a smile.<br>She still thought that Chu Feng was being too stubborn for his own good, but she respected the tenacity he was displaying here.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s no need for you to worry about the early Half-God level category. You should be at Martial Exalted level too, right? If I remember correctly, Junior Long told me that you&rsquo;re at rank three Martial Exalted level,&rdquo; Zhao Yunmo said.<br>Chu Feng was indeed at rank three Martial Exalted level when he parted ways with Long XIaoxiao at the Holy Valley. However, he couldn&rsquo;t help but notice skepticism in Zhao Yunmo&rsquo;s eyes when he asked that question.<br>It would appear that he didn&rsquo;t think that Chu Feng was even at rank three Martial Exalted level. It was not that he despised Chu Feng but the entire Holy Light Galaxy.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled at the duo, choosing not to answer their question.<br>He could tell that Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo were hiding ulterior motives beneath their amicable front, so he didn&rsquo;t want to be honest with them.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to answer our question. We get it.&rdquo;<br>Both Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo smiled deeply. They were even more certain now that Chu Feng had deceived Long Xiaoxiao.<br>&ldquo;Hell that they get anything at all!&rdquo; Eggy sneered contemptuously. &ldquo;Chu Feng, those two fellows are clearly up to no good. It&rsquo;s not safe for Long Xiaoxiao to travel with them. Why don&rsquo;t you just kill them so that we don&rsquo;t have to watch their disgusting act?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No hurry. I&rsquo;ll need proper justification to deal with them, or else Long Xiaoxiao would be placed in an awkward position. Just because they are bad people doesn&rsquo;t mean that their master is bad too. I can&rsquo;t ruin Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s future just to get swift gratification,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;All right. You should handle it however you deem fit,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>Chu Feng continued chatting with Cheng Tianchan and Zhao Yunmo, and he soon caught wind of a piece of good news.<br>It turned out that the Trial of the Strongest classified its participants based on their martial cultivation, which meant that Chu Feng was able to join the late Martial Exalted level category. Upon learning the news, he quickly made up his mind to participate in the Trial of the Strongest too.<br>Long Xiaoxiao was overjoyed at the news, thinking that Chu Feng would be joining the same early Martial Exalted level category as her.<br>Chu Feng could guess what was running through her mind, and it left him conscience-stricken. He could already imagine just how disappointed she would be when she learned about his true cultivation level. He wondered if he should tell her right now lest she gets her hopes up.<br>Having guessed his dilemma, Eggy said, &ldquo;You should hold it in for now, Chu Feng. That way, you can catch those two fellows by surprise.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll listen to Milady Queen&rsquo;s words.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was still feeling self-reproach at having deceived Long Xiaoxiao, but Eggy&rsquo;s words soothed his conscience.<br>&ldquo;Trial of the Strongest? Let me just how formidable the prodigies of the Totem Galaxy are!&rdquo; Chu Feng clenched his fists in excitement.<br>He knew that he would be put against the strongest cultivators in the Totem Galaxy in his category, and his opponents wouldn&rsquo;t just be limited to just juniors. It would truly be a fight to determine the strongest.<br></div>
