        <h1>Chapter 2994</h1>
        <div> - Do Not Blame Me For Being Impolite<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, what certainty of success do you possess?&rdquo; Chu Ruoshi asked.<br>&ldquo;Around eighty percent,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Eighty percent? You are truly one to boast excessively with no shame,&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s words immediately brought ridicule from Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu.<br>Perhaps due to the fact that they detested Chu Feng from the bottoms of their hearts, they simply did not believe Chu Feng would be capable of solving the Yin Yang Formation Diagram.<br>However, they had no idea that Chu Feng was actually being humble when he said he had an eighty percent certainty of success. If Chu Feng had to be completely honest, then he would have at least a ninety percent certainty of success in solving the Yin Yang Formation Diagram.<br>That said, Chu Feng did not bother to argue with them. He merely took a glance at Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu. He said, &ldquo;If the two of you do not wish to return empty-handed, it&rsquo;d be best for you to shut your mouths. Do not disturb me while I decipher this Yin Yang Formation Diagram.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bastard, you dare speak to me with such a tone?! Who did you think you are?!&rdquo; Chu Feng immediately enraged both Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu.<br>However, before the two of them could finish cursing out at Chu Feng, Chu Ruoshi said, &ldquo;The two of you should've entered this place for the sake of advancing yourselves. The current situation is practically a deadlock. Little brother Chu Feng is the only person capable of getting us out of this deadlock. Thus, the two of you should stop trying to deliberately cause trouble."<br>"Chu Ruoshi, you also know that the Yin Yang Formation Diagram is unrelated to world spirit techniques or martial techniques. All of our seniors from the past were unable to solve the Yin Yang Formation Diagram. Do you really think that Chu Feng will be able to solve the Yin Yang Formation Diagram?" Chu Haoyan asked in a very displeased manner.<br>"It is one thing as to whether or not the Yin Yang Formation Diagram can be solved. However, among all of us present here, only little brother Chu Feng dares to attempt to solve the Yin Yang Formation Diagram," Chu Ruoshi said.<br>Chu Haoyan frowned upon hearing those words. However, his expression soon changed.<br>He seemed to have comprehended something.<br>Ever since Chu Feng returned to their Chu Heavenly Clan, he had been basking in the limelight the entire time. He had practically done everything that was impossible for them.<br>That said, the difficulty of the Yin Yang Formation Diagram was extremely high.<br>No one even knew how to decipher it, much less actually solving it.<br>If they were to allow Chu Feng to attempt to solve it, Chu Feng would likely end up being incapable of solving it too. Should that happen, they would not lose anything. Yet, Chu Feng, on the other hand, would suffer a setback. His status in the hearts of the crowd would also decline.<br>As such, Chu Haoyan decided to say no more. He stood to the side and quietly watched it all unfold.<br>Chu Huanyu was also doing the same thing.<br>......<br>At that moment, no one was willing to disturb Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, the entire region became extremely quiet. With this, Chu Feng was able to concentrate on thinking of a method to solve the Yin Yang Formation Diagram.<br>That&rsquo;s right, if one wanted to solve the Yin Yang Formation Diagram, figuring out how to decipher it was the most important. As long as one figured out how to decipher it, one would be able to figure out how to solve it.<br>Once Chu Feng began to examine the Yin Yang Formation Diagram, he continued for two entire hours. During that period, Chu Feng was completely motionless. He did not even blink a single time. It was as if he was completely petrified as he stared at the sky above.<br>After two hours passed, Chu Haoyan was finally unable to contain himself and began to make more cutting remarks against Chu Feng. &ldquo;Chu Ruoshi, you&rsquo;re seeing this too. It&rsquo;s not that I refuse to give this Chu Feng a chance; merely, its been two hours now. Yet he still has not found the slightest clue. The way I see it, he simply has no idea how to solve the Yin Yang Formation Diagram.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that a certain someone wishes for my failure greatly,&rdquo; right after Chu Haoyan said those words, Chu Feng who had been motionless for a very long time, suddenly moved.<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m afraid I will have to disappoint you again,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to Chu Haoyan.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, could it be that you&rsquo;ve discovered the method to decipher the Yin Yang Formation Diagram?&rdquo; Chu Ruoshi hurriedly asked.<br>&ldquo;I already know how to solve the Yin Yang Formation Diagram,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, are you certain?&rdquo; Once Chu Feng said those words, in addition to Chu Ruoshi, the great majority of people present revealed expressions of expectation.<br>&ldquo;Every word I will say now will concern whether or not this Yin Yang Formation Diagram can be successfully solved. Thus, I hope that everyone will remember my words. The reason for that is because if we want to solve this Yin Yang Formation Diagram, I will need everyone to work together,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>After that, Chu Feng began to explain the method to solve the Yin Yang Formation Diagram to the crowd.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s method was actually an order to everyone present. He was giving them different assignments.<br>To put it simply, this Yin Yang Formation Diagram was designed for all of the younger generations present. Thus, everyone had to participate in order to solve it.<br>The crowd was skeptical of Chu Feng&rsquo;s words. This was especially true for Chu Haoyan and Chu Huanyu. At the beginning, they were feeling that it was beneath their dignity to take orders from Chu Feng.<br>That said, they all wished to obtain the treasures there. Thus, even though they were skeptical, they still decided to try their luck.<br>For their common interest, they actually did as Chu Feng ordered.<br>That said, after the crowd left, Chu Feng did not leave.<br>Chu Feng sat down cross-legged and began to form a formation using both his martial power and spirit power.<br>That formation of his resembled a world. However, the inside of that world was completely empty.<br>However, light soon started to flicker in that world.<br>&ldquo;Success! Eggy, did you see that? The method to solving the Yin Yang Formation Diagram I&rsquo;ve deciphered is effective,&rdquo; Chu Feng was feeling extremely joyous.<br>Even though this was something that he had anticipated, Chu Feng was still unable to contain his emotions when it actually succeeded.<br>More and more lights began to appear in the formation Chu Feng had set up. Each light that appeared meant that a person had successfully accomplished the mission Chu Feng had tasked them with.<br>Finally, everyone finished the missions Chu Feng had tasked them with. Furthermore, they all returned quickly.<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, what you&rsquo;ve said is actually true. After going to the direction indicated by you and summoning according to the method you indicated, I really managed to find a banner.&rdquo;<br>The great majority of people were excited when they returned. Furthermore, they were all holding a banner that seemed to be composed of light. Although the banners were not very large, they were filled with spirituality. It was as if they were capable of controlling living things.<br>However, not everyone was holding a banner in their hand. Chu Huanyu, Chu Haoyan and even Chu Ruoshi and Chu Zhiyuan did not return with banners.<br>Instead, they returned empty-handed.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, please hand your banners to me. Only by assimilating the banners into the formation will we be able to determine where the treasures are located at,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, the great majority of the people present did not hesitate to hand their banners to Chu Feng.<br>Activating the formation in his hand, the banners began to assimilate into Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation.<br>However, there was still a small portion of people that did not hand their banners to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother hiding it, I know that you all have obtained banners too. It&rsquo;s time to hand them over,&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to Chu Ruoshi, Chu Huanyu and the others.<br>&ldquo;Humph, why must we hand our banners to you? What are we to do if you decide to abandon us and search for the treasures yourself after we hand over our banners to you?&rdquo; Chu Haoyan asked.<br>Once he said those words, many people revealed worried expressions, especially those that had already handed their banners to Chu Feng.<br>They were truly afraid that Chu Feng would, like Chu Haoyan said, try to hog all of the treasures for himself.<br>&ldquo;I, Chu Feng, will definitely not embezzle the treasures. However, there is one thing I must remind you all of. It is up to your own capabilities, your own talent, as to how much treasure you can obtain. That is what I&rsquo;ve managed to decipher from the Yin Yang Formation Diagram.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, regardless of how much treasure you all might be able to obtain, I will still bring you all to where the treasures are.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, the prerequisite for that is that you all must hand your banners to me, no exceptions,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Humph, only a fool would believe you,&rdquo; Chu Huanyu said with a cold snort.<br>&ldquo;I believe you all are certain of one thing. If it wasn&rsquo;t for me, you all would not even be able to find your banners. Right now, I hope that you all will cooperate with me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Humph, if it wasn&rsquo;t for us, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to find the treasures either. In the end, you&rsquo;re merely using us,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan said.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that I was not sufficiently clear with my words.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, I will change my wording,&rdquo; after saying those words, Chu Feng, who was originally sitting on the ground in a cross-legged manner, suddenly stood up. He looked to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, I, Chu Feng, am not trying to discuss this with you all. I hope that you all will cooperate with me. Otherwise&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise what?&rdquo; Chu Haoyan asked.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng chuckled lightly. Then, he said, &ldquo;Do not blame me, Chu Feng&hellip; for being impolite.&rdquo;<br>The good-natured expression on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face disappeared. It was replaced with an incomparably cold and fierce expression. <br></p></div>
