        <div> - The Reappearance Of The Demon Armament<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><br>&ldquo;Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom~~~&rdquo;<br>The three martial skills collided. Immediately, they brought forth massive energy ripples.<br>In an instant, countless surrounding buildings were destroyed.<br>From this, it was completely revealed how powerful True Immortals were.<br>Furthermore, as the two parties fighting were extremely close to one another, the power of the energy ripples were even more ferocious. As such, even Zi Xunyi herself was forced back repeatedly by the energy ripples.<br>Fortunately, Chu Feng was hiding behind Zi Xunyi. Otherwise, the energy ripples themselves would be sufficient to obliterate him.<br>As Chu Feng could not even defeat rank one True Immortals, rank two True Immortals were so powerful that they were akin to a nightmare for him.<br>&ldquo;And here I thought that the person standing behind Chu Feng would be an expert from the Upper Realms. Turns out, it&rsquo;s only someone from the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan,&rdquo; The Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said coldly.<br>He had already determined from the martial skill that Zi Xunyi used that she was someone from the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan.<br>The reason for that was because the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan would never teach their martial skills to others. Thus, as of now, no one apart from the Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen knew the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s martial skills.<br>&ldquo;Bloodscale Monstrous Clan, you all have been withdrawn from the world&rsquo;s affairs for thousands of years. I had thought that you all would really continue to be hidden forever.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Turns out, you all have been secretly nurturing this freak Chu Feng. You all have quite the ambition,&rdquo; The Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke with a mocking tone.<br>&ldquo;Bloodscale Monstrous Clan, you will pay miserably for protecting that Chu Feng. Not only are you going to die today, but your Bloodscale Monstrous Clan will also be completely exterminated.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I will have your Bloodscale Monstrous Clan completely erased from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm from this point on. I will make it so that there will be no information regarding you at all,&rdquo; the Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said while pointing at Zi Xunyi. His attitude was extremely high and above, extremely aggressive.<br>It was as if he would really be able to determine the fate of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan if he wanted to.<br>&ldquo;Humph, it is not that I am looking down on you all. However, if you dare to intrude into our Demon Eliminate Cave, before you can even reach our Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s headquarters, your entire army will be utterly destroyed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eliminate us? You&rsquo;re speaking as if you all never planned to eliminate us to begin with. The only reason why you didn&rsquo;t was because you did not have the ability to do so,&rdquo; Zi Xunyi mocked.<br>Being raised in the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan, Zi Xunyi actually knew the way the Kong Heavenly Clan and Zhou Heavenly Clan did things very well.<br>These two self-proclaimed righteous families were actually filled with ambitions. They had always been eyeing the treasures of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan covetously.<br>Merely, due to the fact that there were too many Ancient Era&rsquo;s slaughtering formations in the Demon Elimination Cave, they were unable to have their way the entire time.<br>Thus, she felt it very ridiculous for the Kong Heavenly Clan and the Zhou Heavenly Clan to proclaim that they eliminate the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan in front of her.<br>&ldquo;You will not be able to witness whether or not we actually possess the power. After all, you will not be able to live past today.&rdquo;<br>As the Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke, he unleashed his attack.<br>Immediately after him, the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief also unleashed his attack.<br>Merely, this time around, their attacks were different from before. The reason for that was because even the five Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elders who had been standing behind their clan chief the entire time joined in to attack Zi Xunyi.<br>At that moment, surging lightning was flickering on their bodies. These were not lightning from the power of their Heavenly Bloodlines. However, it greatly resembled the lightning of Heavenly Bloodlines.<br><br>The lightning emitted from their bodies started to fuse with one another. At that moment, the auras of the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief grew increasingly more powerful.<br>A formation. It was a grand slaughtering formation, a formation that only Heavenly Bloodline possessors could set up.<br>&ldquo;If you are to concede to us now, we can consider leaving you an intact corpse,&rdquo; The Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said to Zi Xunyi.<br>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; Faced with the situation at hand, Zi Xunyi was not only unafraid; she even let out a cold snort of disdain.<br>Then, purple light flickered in her eyes. The next moment, the surging purple gaseous flames on her body grew even more ferocious.<br><br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Immediately afterward, she actually tossed away her two daggers.<br><br>At the same moment when the two purple daggers were tossed out, surging martial power was emitted without reservation.<br>The next moment, the two daggers started to spin simultaneously. Then, they actually started to emit purple gaseous flames. Following the daggers, the purple gaseous flames also started to rotate, forming majestic purple whirlwinds.<br>&ldquo;That is!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that the ability Zi Xunyi used was no small matter.<br>Not only was it an Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill, but it was also an Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill that perfectly harmonized with the power of her Ancestral Armaments. The might of that attack was extremely powerful.<br>&ldquo;Zzzzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, lightning started to flicker and surge. A large area of lightning struck down from the sky like a sea of lightning.<br><br>It was the slaughtering formation cast by the joint effort of the Kong Heavenly Clan and Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s True Immortals.<br><br>In an instant, the enormous sea of lightning collided with the whirlwinds brought forth by Zi Xunyi&rsquo;s daggers.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, rumbles began to be heard all over as sparks swirled in the air. The collision between the lightning and the purple gaseous flames created wave upon wave of powerful energy ripples that wreaked havoc throughout their surroundings.<br>Zi Xunyi was extremely powerful. She actually managed to block the grand slaughtering formation jointly unleashed by the Kong Heavenly Clan and Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s True Immortals.<br><br>Unfortunately, her powers were finite. If this were to continue, she would naturally lose.<br>&ldquo;I shall see exactly how much longer you can persevere.&rdquo;<br>The Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had evidently also noticed this. Thus, they did not utilize any other techniques, and continued to suppress Zi Xunyi with their grand slaughtering formation. They planned to have her completely exhaust her stamina and then utterly defeat her.<br>Not long after this battle of attrition began, Zi Xunyi&rsquo;s complexion grew ugly. Chu Feng knew that Zi Xunyi would not be able to persevere for long.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, not long after that, Zi Xunyi sprayed out a mouthful of blood. Immediately afterward, her aura grew much weaker. Her daggers that were contending against the grand Heavenly Bloodline slaughtering formation were also pushed back several meters.<br>Zi Xunyi hurriedly adjusted herself and continued to send forth her power to her daggers. With great difficulty, she managed to continue to persevere.<br>However, Chu Feng noticed that Zi Xunyi&rsquo;s body was trembling violently.<br>She was no longer able to continue to resist the grand slaughtering formation. In fact, she was on the verge of collapse.<br>Chu Feng knew that he could not continue to watch with folded arms.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, I must act,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Eggy.<br>&ldquo;Go ahead. As matters stand, you can only fight with your all,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen spoke with a supporting tone.<br>After receiving Her Lady Queen&rsquo;s approval, Chu Feng streaked his hand across his Cosmos Sack.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, a long crimson sword appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br><br>Chu Feng raised the sword up high and looked to the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. He shouted, &ldquo;Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, do you still remember this sword?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing the Evil God Sword, the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had an immediate change in expression.<br>The expression that appeared on his face was clearly that of fear.<br>He was scared. He was unable to not be scared. After all, two years ago, Chu Feng had relied on that exact same sword to nearly extinguish his entire Kong Heavenly Clan.<br>Due to being overwhelmingly scared, the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief actually took two steps back and directly withdrew his martial power.<br>As one of the most important members in the slaughtering formation, his sudden withdrawal caused the grand slaughtering formation to instantly fall apart.<br><br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Zi Xunyi knelt in the ground and started to gasp. She was sweating profusely.<br>Even her two Ancestral Armament daggers directly fell to the ground.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell that it was fortunate that the grand slaughtering formation had fallen apart upon the withdrawal of the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Otherwise, Zi Xunyi would most definitely have have suffered serious injuries. It might even be possible for her to have been bombarded to death by them.<br>The reason for that was because she was no longer able to withstand the grand slaughtering formation. As long as she failed to keep it at bay, the grand slaughtering formation would strike down upon her.<br>If she were to be struck by such a powerful grand slaughtering formation, the aftermath&hellip; would naturally be unthinkable.<br>&ldquo;We were about to settle them. What the hell are you doing?&rdquo;<br>The Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief looked at the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief with a puzzled expression.<br>He was also able to tell that they'd been about to obliterate Zi Xunyi and Chu Feng with the grand slaughtering formation.<br>To suddenly stop at a time like this meant that all of their efforts would be in vain. As such, he was naturally feeling very displeased.<br><br>&ldquo;Demon Armament, that is the Demon Armament,&rdquo; The Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief pointed to Chu Feng&rsquo;s Evil God Sword.<br><br>When he spoke, not only was his body trembling, but even his voice was trembling.<br>From this, it could be seen how deeply afraid of Chu Feng&rsquo;s Evil God Sword he was.<br><br></p></div>
