        <div> - The Structure Of The Holy Light Galaxy<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior, if you know about them, please tell me who they are,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>The power Chu Feng was asking Long Daozhi about, was the power that had forcibly taken Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Chu Feng wanted to know exactly where they came from so that he could inquire about her in the future.<br>If Yin Zhuanghong was living well, everything would be fine.<br>However, if her condition wasn&rsquo;t good, he definitely wouldn't just sit and watch idly.<br>Long Daozhi did not answer Chu Feng directly, and instead asked him, &ldquo;Chu Feng, how knowledgeable are you about the structure of the Holy Light Galaxy?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This junior is ignorant. My current knowledge is limited to knowing that there are ninety-six starfields in the Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Among them, ten are Abandoned Starfields, fifty are Lower Starfields, thirty are Middle Starfields and six are Upper Starfields.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for which power rules over which starfield, this junior has no idea at all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior may even laugh at my ignorance, as even the colossal Dragon Clan was something that this junior had just learned about,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied honestly.<br>&ldquo;Actually, you&rsquo;ve only returned to the Upper Realms recently.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the Lower Realms, information is very inaccessible. It is normal that you lack knowledge.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, since you&rsquo;re someone of the Holy Light Galaxy, you should be knowledgeable of the structure of the Holy Light Galaxy. That knowledge will serve to benefit you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Upper Starfields represent the strongest powers in the Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Naturally, among them would be the Holy Light Clan. Although they reside in the Holy Light Starfield, the entire Holy Light Galaxy is their territory. They are the fully deserving overlord of the Holy Light Galaxy. No one dares to challenge them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if the five other Upper Starfields were to join hands, they still wouldn't dare to challenge the might of the Holy Light Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, the other five Upper Starfields are also extremely powerful existences. Their strength is second to only the Holy Light Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the other five Upper Starfields, they are respectively&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Totem Starfield, ruled by the Dragon Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Heavenly Vein Starfield, ruled by the Yu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Monstrous Clan Starfield, ruled by the Monstrous Herd Temple.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And&hellip; the Hidden Dragon Starfield, and the Death Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Hidden Dragon Starfield and the Death Starfield are relatively special.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Death Starfield does not have a nominal ruler.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is a place where the scattered experts of the Holy Light Galaxy are gathered.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those experts are all very powerful. That is why the Death Starfield is classified as an Upper Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the Hidden Dragon Starfield, it is an even more mysterious place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why the Hidden Dragon Starfield is mysterious is because very rarely do people from the Holy Light Galaxy see them, as they will mainly remain inside the Hidden Dragon Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, the Hidden Dragon Starfield strictly prohibits outsiders from entering.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Apart from the people from the Holy Light Galaxy that are able to directly visit them, no one else is allowed to enter their starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If anyone enters without their permission, they will kill them without warning.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The entire Hidden Dragon Starfield is extremely mysterious. Even though they are located within the Holy Light Galaxy, their position is ever-changing. Furthermore, they are protected by an extremely strong concealing power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, it is said that apart from the people of the Holy Light Clan and Hidden Dragon Starfield, very few people are able to find the location of the Hidden Dragon Starfield,&rdquo; said Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Thus, the Hidden Dragon Starfield is also a place without a clear-cut ruler?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No. The Hidden Dragon Starfield has a ruler. Furthermore, they only have a single power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This power is called the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect,&rdquo; said Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Hidden Dragon Martial Sect? So it&rsquo;s a sect?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Correct, it is indeed a sect,&rdquo; said Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Since they&rsquo;re a sect, they should accept disciples openly, no? Why would they be so hidden then?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That question of yours is right on the mark.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The mysterious aspect about the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect lies in one&rsquo;s inability to join it through one&rsquo;s own attempts. It only invites others of its own accord. Only those who are invited are qualified to join the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, it is not that one will definitely be able to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect should one possess exceptional talent. The Hidden Dragon Martial Sect has their own special method of selecting disciples.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, I&rsquo;ve heard that the disciples that are chosen by the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect will have to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect regardless of whether they want to or not,&rdquo; said Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Do they capture people if they&rsquo;re unwilling to join?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a joking smile.<br>&ldquo;While I cannot be certain, it seems to have happened before. There are a few such rumors in the Holy Light Galaxy,&rdquo; said Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;What? They&rsquo;re simply too overbearing, no?&rdquo; Chu Feng narrowed his brows.<br>His impression toward the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect had gotten very bad.<br>What he hated the most were cultivators that used their strength to force others to do things they didn&rsquo;t want to do.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that the people wearing white gowns with lingering mist are people from the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>After all, Yin Zhuanghong had been forcibly taken away that day.<br>&ldquo;No, no, no. I told you about those five powers because I wanted to let you know about the structure of the Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I also wanted to let you know which powers are the most dangerous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you have a truly hot temper. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s inevitable that you&rsquo;ll end up offending people.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, you must remember this. Including the Holy Light Clan, you must absolutely not offend those five powers.&rdquo;<br>Oh, that&rsquo;s right. There&rsquo;s another power that you cannot offend.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is the power you spoke of.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re called the Cloudsky Immortal Sect,&rdquo; said Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Cloudsky Immortal Sect?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re that white-gowned power?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;From your description, it should be them. They&rsquo;re the only ones that will dress in that sort of attire,&rdquo; said Long Daozhi.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what sort of power is this Cloudsky Immortal Sect?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked urgently.<br>He was not interested in the Dragon Clan, Monstrous Herd Temple, Yu Heavenly Clan, Hidden Dragon Martial Sect or the Death Starfield.<br>What he was concerned about was the power that had captured Yin Zhuanghong.<br>Through Long Daozhi&rsquo;s explanation, Chu Feng had finally learned about the Cloudsky Immortal Sect.<br>Among the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s thirty Middle Starfields, the strongest was a starfield called the Flying Clouds Starfield.<br>The Flying Clouds Starfield was publicly accepted as being stronger than all but the Upper Starfields.<br>The reason for their reputation was due to the Flying Cloud Starfield&rsquo;s overlord power, the Dao Sword Immortal Sect.<br>However, the overlord of the Flying Clouds Starfield had recently changed.<br>The Dao Sword Immortal Sect had been defeated.<br>As for the ones that had defeated them, they were the Cloudsky Immortal Sect.<br>Even though the Cloudsky Immortal Sect had existed in the Flying Clouds Starfield the entire time, they were completely obscure. No one knew much about them.<br>Because of that, their sudden defeat of the Dao Sword Immortal Sect had shocked the powers of the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>Of course, this information first had first entered the ears of the major powers&rsquo;.<br>It was only afterwards that it spread to the common folk.<br>Judging from the situation at that moment, the information had yet to spread.<br>That was also the reason why the majority of people were unfamiliar with the Cloudsky Immortal Sect.<br>However, one thing was certain -- the Cloudsky Immortal Sect was extremely powerful. At that moment, Chu Feng still didn&rsquo;t know exactly how strong they were.<br>That said, one thing was certain -- the Cloudsky Immortal Sect was definitely a power backed by a Martial Exalted-level expert.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, the Cloudsky Immortal Sect is incomprehensibly strong.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve hidden their strength for many years. Their vigorous ambitions were not fully revealed. Furthermore, their actions were not limited to defeating the Dao Sword Immortal Sect and gaining rulership over the Flying Clouds Starfield.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Their purpose could very possibly be to have the Flying Clouds Starfield be ranked amongst the Upper Starfields.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, to be ranked amongst the Upper Starfields is no easy task.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The only possible way they can do so would be for them to really possess strength on par with that of the Upper Starfields.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As such, it would be fine if you are merely curious about that Cloudsky Immortal Sect. However, you must make sure to not provoke them.&rdquo;<br>Long Daozhi warned Chu Feng earnestly.<br>&ldquo;Senior can rest assured. I merely met them before. There&rsquo;s no conflict between us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Back then, I saw that they were extremely powerful, and seemed to be of extraordinary origin. That is why I grew curious about them,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>He was lying because he was afraid that Long Daozhi would prevent him from seeking out the Cloudsky Immortal Sect.<br>Long Daozhi was a cautious person. He had asked Chu Feng where he had encountered the Cloudsky Immortal Sect.<br>Since Chu Feng had decided to lie, he naturally had to make sure his lie was watertight.<br>As such, Long Daozhi ended up being successfully deceived by Chu Feng, and believed that he was merely asking out of curiosity. With that, he eased his worrisome heart.<br>As for Chu Feng, an enormous wave was surging in his heart.<br>Even though he knew that the power that had captured Yin Zhuanghong was not one to be looked down upon, he had not expected them to be so powerful.<br>According to Long Daozhi, even if the Cloudsky Immortal Sect was not as powerful as the Dragon Clan, Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, Yu Heavenly Clan, Monstrous Herd Temple and Death Starfield, their strength was very close to those Upper Starfields&rsquo; level.<br>&lsquo;Seems like it&rsquo;ll be a challenge,&rsquo; Chu Feng sighed in his heart.<br>He did not show any fear. Instead, he was excited.<br>Throughout his journey, there had been powers that were akin to colossuses blocking his path.<br>Yet now, those so-called colossuses would all be trampled beneath his feet.<br>In fact, many of them had been reduced to ants in his eyes.<br>The giant mountains that had blocked his path in the past had been reduced to dust.<br>The Cloudsky Immortal Sect would definitely not be an exception.<br>After all, Chu Feng&rsquo;s journey would definitely not be limited to only the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>Instead, his journey would encompass the entire vast martial cultivation world.<br>&hellip;...<br>What Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know was that...<br>After he left the Purple Star Hall, a calamity had quietly descended upon the Purple Star Hall...<br></p></div>
