        <h1>Chapter 5668: Leaving His Name on the Stele, the Final Galaxy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There </span><span>were</span><span> a total of three Conqueror Steles in total. The first one was shattered, the third one was blank, and only the second one contained </span><span>names</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>1: Qin Jiu</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second name was blurry, an indication that the person was hiding their identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>3: Song </span><span>Shu&rsquo;an</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fourth name was blurry as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>5: Ba </span><span>Jiutian</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>6: Zhongli </span><span>Bahuang</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other than the two blurred names, the remaining four names were written in different strokes, which suggested that they had personally written down their names.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng rose in the air and approached the second Conqueror Stele in hopes of seeing it at a closer distance, but it was protected by an invisible barrier. The same went for the first Conqueror Stele too, though he noticed some key details about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were over nine hundred names on the first Conqueror Stele, and they were written so huge that it practically filled the entire monument. It was just that the first Conqueror Stele was so cracked that it was impossible to make out the names.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;If the three Conqueror Steles represented the Immemorial Era, the Ancient Era, and the current era respectively, aren&rsquo;t there too many experts in the Immemorial Era? Could it be that the right to leave one&rsquo;s name on the monument is not based on one&rsquo;s capabilities but something else?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured as he made his way to the third Conqueror Stele.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third Conqueror Stele was enveloped in a protective barrier too, but Chu Feng was able to pass right through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;It looks like the barrier really does restrict people from different time periods. The three Conqueror Stele most likely corresponds to the Immemorial Era, the Ancient Era, and the current era,&rdquo; Chu Feng muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he approached the third Conqueror Stele to take a closer look, he suddenly felt tremendous pressure coming from above. He plummeted from the sky and crashed into the ground, leaving a massive pit in his wake. Even so, the ground around him continued to crumble under the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an extremely powerful oppressive might, but it was no ordinary oppressive might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried his best to get up and take a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then he noticed a gigantic brush in the sky. The brush was over a thousand meters long. It was shaped like a cone, with a large brush tip that spanned over a hundred meters in width, and it slowly contracted down its body till it was around the width of a regular brush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that Chu Feng could still hold the end of the brush normally despite being much smaller than it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The brush glowed brilliantly like a second sun in the sky, making it clear that it was a treasure of immeasurable value. As a matter of fact, it was an immemorial treasure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being crushed on the ground, Chu Feng still revealed a look of frenzied joy when he saw the brush. He could tell from its size and shape that the other names on </span><span>the Conqueror Steles were written with this very brush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gut feeling told him that as long as he could conquer this gigantic brush, he might have the qualification to leave his name on the third Conqueror Stele.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Where did this young child come from?&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s voice echoed from the brush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sounded mature and reliable yet gentle and euphonious at the same time. It was his first time hearing this voice, but it set his mind at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, how can I leave my name on the Conqueror Stele? Do I have to withstand this oppressive might?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Child, just withstanding my oppressive might isn&rsquo;t enough. You&rsquo;ll have to be able to grab this brush as well,&rdquo; the woman replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Thank you for your advice, elder,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then flipped his body around and lay unmoving on the ground. Moments later, he even closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Child, you may surrender if you&rsquo;re at your limit, and I&rsquo;ll let you go. However, you&rsquo;ll lose the right to leave your name on the Conqueror Stele,&rdquo; the woman said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only till an hour later that he finally opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awake? Are you going to surrender?&rdquo; the woman asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, I wasn&rsquo;t sleeping,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What were you doing then?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I was getting accustomed to your oppressive might.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Those words piqued the woman&rsquo;s interest as she asked, &ldquo;Did you manage to become accustomed to it then?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you judge for yourself?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng suddenly leaped up from the pit, defying the oppressive might to rise into the sky. He was moving slower than usual, but it was astounding that he could move at such a speed despite being under the influence of the oppressive might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;This child!&rdquo; the woman exclaimed in surprise, clearly not expecting Chu Feng to accustom so well to the oppressive might within an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Chu Feng had already arrived at the end of the brush and was just about to reach out and grab it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Child, I advise you to wait. The oppressive might is the preliminary test. The real test begins when you come into contact with the brush,&rdquo; the woman said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Thank you for your pointer, but I am ready,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied as he wrapped his hand around the brush handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&hellip;Nothing happened. Chu Feng grabbed the brush handle without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, when does the real test begin?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; The woman fell silent. &ldquo;Write your name down.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Thank you, elder.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overjoyed, Chu Feng flew to the highest point of the Conqueror Stele with this gigantic brush in hand and wrote his name down at the top. His name, &lsquo;Chu Feng&rsquo;, was conspicuous as the monument was previously empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world shook the moment he finished writing his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense the Conqueror Stele releasing a powerful surge of energy that rushed into his own body. It turned out his conjecture about the Nine Heavens Secret Domain was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In gist, it was an incomparably powerful teleportation formation that allowed one to travel between galaxies within an extremely short period of time, just that it was actually connected to all Nine Galaxies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he now wielded the power to activate this incomparably powerful teleportation formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng formed a series of hand seals in front of the Conqueror Stele, and the surrounding earth started to shake. Eight gates that boasted a height of over ten thousand meters rose from the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked identical to the mysterious, towering gate he had encountered earlier in the Nine Heavens Secret Domain, just that these eight gates looked brand new. None of them were labeled, but now that he had grasped the secret of the Nine Heavens Secret Domain, he could sense that they represented the eight galaxies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ancestral Martial, Nine Souls, Totem, Immortal Sea, Seven Realms, Divine Body, Heavenly Dome, and Bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s one missing,&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured with narrowed eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was still one more gate missing, and his intuition told him that it might be the mysterious gate he had seen earlier inside the trial. It was the gate that led to the Ninth Galaxy, the Immemorial Domain of Gods.</span></p></div>
