        <h1>Chapter 1782</h1>
        <div> - Friend Appearing On Stage<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Calm your anger. It is to our benefit that Chu Feng has shown up. Rest assured, we will help you take the Heavenly Immortal Sword back. At that time, the Heavenly Immortal Sword will still be your Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s possession. As for that Chu Feng&hellip; he will undoubtedly be killed,&rdquo; The other three Supreme Elders said with beaming smiles.<br>After knowing that Chu Feng had come, the ones who were most excited were them. They had set up an inescapable net just to capture Chu Feng. Since Chu Feng had shown up, it meant that Chu Feng would definitely not be able to escape.<br>&ldquo;Gulp~~~&rdquo;<br>Inside the fort, Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish all gulped down a mouthful of saliva.<br>While the people outside of the fort were unable to see the situation inside, they were able to see everything outside. Thus, they had also seen what had happened earlier.<br>The Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had attacked the fort, only to be knocked flying by the fort. This was a truly stunning sight to behold.<br>However, what they saw was not only limited to the humiliation the Ximen Imperial Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had suffered. In addition to that, they had also seen his overflowing killing intent.<br>Thus, they turned their gazes filled with worries to Chu Feng.<br>While he might be safe within the fort, if Chu Feng were to exit the fort, how would he be able to survive?<br>In fact, it was not only the three of them that were thinking like this; many other people were also thinking the same thing. However, Chu Feng had a very unconcerned expression. He was focused on the Heavenly Immortal Sword that he held in his hand.<br>While it was true that his Evil God Sword was more powerful than the Heavenly Immortal Sword, Chu Feng did not dare to use his Evil God Sword again.<br>As for this Heavenly Immortal Sword, although he was planning to sell it off, he did not mind using it before he sold it. After all, he also knew very well how powerful the Heavenly Immortal Sword was.<br>Although it was inferior to the Evil God Sword, it was superior to ordinary Incomplete Imperial Armaments.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, an aura surged forth, and the sky started to change as a ray of light flew out from the Heavenly Immortal Sword and entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>The very next moment, that Heavenly Immortal Sword that was violently trembling stopped its trembling. Its current appearance was much more obedient than the time it was in Ximen Feixue&rsquo;s possession.<br>&ldquo;Absolute Submission.&rdquo; [1. How could Chu Feng still sell it if it entered Absolute Submission?]<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng was capable of making even such a weapon enter Absolute Submission?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Making it enter Absolute Submission is not the most amazing feat. The most amazing feat was that he was able to make such a powerful Incomplete Imperial Armament enter Absolute Submission in such a short period of time.&rdquo;<br>As they saw Chu Feng making the Heavenly Immortal Sword enter Absolute Submission before their very eyes, the dragons among men, the peak geniuses of the Holy Land of Martialism, were all stunned. Unable to help themselves, they sucked in a mouthful of cold air.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?! That Chu Feng possesses such enormous talent?!&rdquo; At this moment, envy and refusal to accept appeared within Baili Xinghe&rsquo;s gaze that was filled with hostility toward Chu Feng.<br>He also wanted the Heavenly Immortal Sword. He felt that the Heavenly Immortal Sword was very well suited to him, and that it should be his.<br>Thus, when Chu Feng was trying to subdue the Heavenly Immortal Sword, he had hoped that Chu Feng would fail to do so. If that were the case, he would have the opportunity to make the Heavenly Immortal Sword his.<br>However, not only did Chu Feng not fail, he had instead made the Heavenly Immortal Sword enter Absolute Submission. This made him feel an enormous frustration and displeasure.<br>In fact, not to mention the others, a flash of surprise even appeared in the eyes of the mysterious man standing in the sky.<br>Merely, his surprise lasted but a moment. Not to mention the others, not even Chu Feng noticed it.<br>Suddenly, the mysterious man looked to Chu Feng&rsquo;s pagoda and said, &ldquo;Chili Pepper, Big Radish, Little Radish, you all can come out.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish were all startled. However, they did not hesitate and all walked out from within Chu Feng&rsquo;s pagoda.<br>&ldquo;What? They&rsquo;re actually three Martial Kings? They are that Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish?&rdquo; Upon seeing the three of them, the people in the crowd were all shocked. While the crowd had thought about a lot of possibilities for Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish&rsquo;s identities, it was clear that they were completely different from what the crowd had anticipated.<br>They&hellip; they were too freaking weak. How could they reach here with their level of cultivation? Furthermore, they got here before them?<br>&ldquo;You three do not possess the level of cultivation to participate in the competition tomorrow. If you three wish to withdraw from the competition, you can do so now,&rdquo; The mysterious man said.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll withdraw,&rdquo; Big Radish and Little Radish said in unison.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll also withdraw,&rdquo; Chili Pepper hesitated momentarily, then also declared that she would withdraw.<br>&ldquo;Mn, the three of you know your own standings,&rdquo; The mysterious man nodded.<br>&ldquo;Merely, senior, may we stay here and watch the competition of the various experts?&rdquo; Chili Pepper asked.<br>At the same time, Big Radish and Little Radish were also looking at that mysterious man with longing gazes.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; The mysterious man laughed lightly. Then he said, &ldquo;You three were brought in here by Chu Feng. Unless you&rsquo;ve broken the rules, only he will be able to decide whether you three can stay or not.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So they were actually brought in here by Chu Feng?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the crowd involuntarily turned their gazes onto Chu Feng. Their gazes were filled with admiration.<br>They had all come here after passing through the various trials and hurdles. Thus, they knew how difficult it was. Especially that final hurdle; the more people there were, the more difficult it would become.<br>Chu Feng had actually been able to bring three Martial Kings in with him. Furthermore, he had been the second fastest to reach this place. How enormous was the strength that he possessed?<br>At this moment, even Leng Yue, the first to arrive in this place, revealed a complicated gaze.<br>However, they didn&rsquo;t know that not only had Chu Feng brought Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish in with him, he had also brought Yan Xie with him. He had come here while bringing four people with him.<br>&ldquo;I hope you all will be able to remember the words I said before. The competition will officially begin tomorrow. For now, you all should properly rest yourselves,&rdquo; After he finished saying those words, the mysterious man disappeared into thin air.<br>However, at this moment, the crowd did not return to their respective pagodas. Instead, their gazes were focused on Chu Feng the entire time. Chu Feng had allowed them to see a great show today. It would not be excessive to say that Chu Feng had broadened their horizons.<br>In fact, for some people, they had begun to feel that they were inferior to Chu Feng before even fighting him.<br>This was especially true for that pair of Heavenly Law Palace&rsquo;s brothers that still stood before Chu Feng. They were rejoicing in the fact that they had not actually fought against Chu Feng.<br>The two of them had seen Chu Feng subduing the Heavenly Immortal Sword at a very close distance. Thus, they knew deeply in their hearts that they were inferior to Chu Feng.<br>He was a demon-level character. Although all of them were called demon-level characters, they felt that Chu Feng was someone that was actually qualified to be known as a demon-level character.<br>While the crowd&rsquo;s gazes were all focused on Chu Feng, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze was focused on the Heavenly Immortal Sword.<br>Carved on the Heavenly Immortal Sword was the Heavenly Immortal Sword Technique. Compared to the Heavenly Immortal Sword, the Heavenly Immortal Sword Technique was the actual thing of value.<br>However, the Heavenly Immortal Sword Technique was something that only the master of the Heavenly Immortal Sword could see. Now that the Heavenly Immortal Sword was in Chu Feng&rsquo;s possession, he would naturally be able to see the Heavenly Immortal Sword Technique. As he saw the superb sword technique, even Chu Feng was unable to contain himself from exclaiming in admiration, &ldquo;What a good sword technique!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Heavenly Immortal Sword Technique is naturally a good sword technique. Junior brother Chu Feng, congratulations.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded from the forest in the distance<br>&ldquo;Junior brother?&rdquo; Hearing those two words, Chu Feng was startled. The reason for that was because that person had addressed him as &lsquo;junior brother.&rsquo; Furthermore, that voice was so familiar.<br>Thus, Chu Feng hurriedly shifted his gaze toward the direction where the voice sounded from.<br>It was only then that he discovered that a man was currently walking over from the direction of the forest with a beaming smile on his face.<br>That man was very powerful. Not only did he possess a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation, his cultivation was also that of a rank eight Half Martial Emperor.<br>To Chu Feng&rsquo;s great surprise, not only was this man someone that he knew, he was someone that he knew very well.<br>This man was his senior brother from the Azure Dragon School, his good brother of many years, Zhang Tianyi.<br>Zhang Tianyi had arrived in the Holy Land of Martialism together with Zi Ling, Su Rou and the others. However, Chu Feng had not managed to see Zhang Tianyi the entire time. He had truly never expected to see Zhang Tianyi here today. Furthermore, Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s strength had become this powerful, to the points where he was much more powerful than Zi Ling and the others.<br>&ldquo;Zhang&hellip;.&rdquo; Overcome with joy, Chu Feng wanted to call out his senior brother Zhang. However, right when the words reached his mouth, he swallowed them.<br>Not only was Zhang Tianyi&rsquo;s cultivation so unreasonably powerful, his outfit was also somewhat special. He was wearing a cyan-green light armor. His armor was evidently special. Furthermore, a large character was written on the armor. It was the character &lsquo;Gong.&rsquo;<br></p></div>
