        <div><span>: Revealing His True Colors</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>This doesn&rsquo;t make sense! Why was Chu Feng able to advance unhindered, whereas our path is immediately blocked off?</span><br><span>When Jie Zhou and the others thought back, they suddenly remembered Chu Feng entering the ice domain with a mysterious zigzag trajectory. They thought that he was just being pretentious, but could it be that he had discovered something that they didn&rsquo;t?</span><br><span>The Jie Clansmen suddenly thought that they were extremely foolish, especially when they looked at the formation that had trapped them.</span><br><span>Each of these ice pillars around them was made up of multiple slaughter formations that would kill them straight away if they touched it, and collectively, they formed an inescapable cage. To make things worse, this cage was slowly closing in on them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master Jie Zhou, what do we do now?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Jie Clansmen turned to Jie Zhou.</span><br><span>In truth, Jie Zhou was already on the verge of peeing himself, but he forced himself to maintain a composed appearance.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I am here.&rdquo; Jie Zhou quickly constructed a formation. &ldquo;Activate!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The formation he had constructed expanded outward and fused into the ice pillars. His goal was to slow down the rate at which the ice pillars were closing in on them. Yet, much to his shock, the ice pillars shuddered upon taking in his formation before suddenly moving even faster than before.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young master Jie Zhou, you!!!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Jie Clansmen were horrified. It was almost as if Jie Zhou was trying to hasten their deaths! They would have cursed out loud if not for their fear of Jie Zhou. It was only now that they finally understood that Jie Zhou didn&rsquo;t understand the formations and was just spouting nonsense.</span><br><span>Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten them trapped here and even accelerated the death trap around them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Look at this. My big brother Chu Feng has already told you to obediently remain on the spot, but you refused to listen, claiming that you need to shoulder the responsibility and fight for the honor of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. What lofty words those are! To put it bluntly, you&rsquo;re just afraid that my big brother Chu Feng will steal your credit for deciphering the secret of this Hidden Land! I guess you&rsquo;d really be taking responsibility </span><span>now, but it&rsquo;s for leading your brethren to their deaths!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing sneered.</span><br><span>In truth, he was afraid of Jie Zhou too, which was why he didn&rsquo;t voice his complaints outright even when he thought that the latter was trash. However, things were different now that Jie Zhou and the others were doomed to certain death.</span><br><span>Jie Zhou felt indignant, but he didn&rsquo;t have the spare energy to refute Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s jarring criticisms when his life was already in danger. He anxiously examined the ice pillars closing in on them, but he was unable to find any openings at all.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Young miss, what do we do? We can&rsquo;t just leave them to the lurch, right?&rdquo; the Ling Clansmen asked Ling Mo&rsquo;er.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There are many slaughter formations lurking inside the ice domain. That ice cage that has imprisoned them is just the tip of the iceberg. Can you guarantee that you won&rsquo;t get caught in any of those slaughter formations? Taking a step back, even if we are that lucky as to not trigger any slaughter formations, do you have the skills to breach that ice cage? I don&rsquo;t know about the rest of you, but I don&rsquo;t think I can do anything about this situation,&rdquo; Ling Mo&rsquo;er said.</span><br><span>The Ling Clansmen fell silent.</span><br><span>They could tell that the slaughter formations that made up the ice cage were even more convoluted than the ice mountain formation. They were indeed beyond their means to deal with.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Jie Zhou, hurry up and think of something. We&rsquo;ll really die if you don&rsquo;t make a move!&rdquo; Jie Yu anxiously exclaimed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Stop rushing me. I&rsquo;m still examining the slaughter formations!&rdquo; Jie Zhou replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Examine my ass! We&rsquo;ll die if you don&rsquo;t start breaching the formation now!&rdquo; Jie Yu cursed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Audacious!&rdquo; Jie Zhou furiously glared at Jie Yu.</span><br><span>Under normal circumstances, Jie Yu would have immediately lowered his head, but things were different now. He glared back at Jie Zhou and shouted, &ldquo;Audacious? Me? Have I said anything wrong thus far? Jie Zhou, admit it. You don&rsquo;t know the formation at all. You recklessly chose to take this risk just to uphold your reputation as the prophesied child, and you even dragged all of us into this as well. Prophesied child, my ass. You&rsquo;re just a selfish prick!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Had it been any other situation, Jie Zhou&rsquo;s lackeys would have already taken down Jie Yu for daring to speak to Jie Zhou in such a manner, but there was not a single person who refuted Jie Yu&rsquo;s words. After all, Jie Yu was voicing out what was on their minds too.</span><br><span>Their fear of Jie Zhou had dissipated now that they were on the verge of death.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Jie Yu, I didn&rsquo;t think that you were in cahoots with Chu Feng. You traitor! How dare you collude with an outsider? Today, I&rsquo;ll eliminate you on behalf of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Zhou turned his attention away from the ice cage and instead began constructing a </span><span>slaughter formation to kill Jie Yu.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You trash! You&rsquo;re just taking it out on me because you can&rsquo;t breach the formation. Sure, kill me then!&rdquo; Jie Yu glanced at Ling Mo&rsquo;er and the others. &ldquo;Young miss Mo&rsquo;er and our brethren from the Ling Clan, please witness my death. The one who murdered me is none other than Jie Zhou! This trash led us to our death, and he lost his patience when I pointed out the truth. All he knows is to oppress his peers. He isn&rsquo;t worthy to be the prophesied child!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Zhou clenched his jaws. He had wanted to kill Jie Yu, but the latter&rsquo;s words placed him in a disadvantageous position.</span><br><span>Just then, frost auras gushed out from the ice pillars and converged to form a human silhouette. It was only possible to barely make out the outlines, but they could tell that it was a woman.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of fighting amongst yourselves? You aren&rsquo;t doomed yet,&rdquo; the frost woman said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, we didn&rsquo;t mean to intrude. Please spare our lives!&rdquo; Jie Zhou began begging for mercy.</span><br><span>The other Jie Clansmen did the same with much more sincere attitudes, but the frost woman kept her eyes on Jie Zhou. &ldquo;Is that how you beg for mercy? It looks like you don&rsquo;t care much about your own life.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Jie Zhou immediately kneeled down and said, &ldquo;Milord, I didn&rsquo;t mean to offend you. I just wanted to lead my brethren from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion out of this place. Please give us a second chance. If you must punish someone, let it be me. Please spare my brethren!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Oh? You&rsquo;re willing to give up your life for others?&rdquo; the frost woman asked.</span><br><span>Jie Zhou&rsquo;s eyes widened in horror. He hurriedly rephrased his words and cried, &ldquo;Milord, please spare our lives!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still putting up a bravado even at this point. Let me ask you this. Do you think that you played an important role in breaching the ice mountain formation earlier?&rdquo; the woman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Jie Zhou&rsquo;s complexion turned awful.</span><br><span>He couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to admit it, but the crowd already understood what was going on.</span><br><span>Jie Zhou hadn&rsquo;t helped in breaching the ice mountain formation at all, but he spoke of it as if Chu Feng had stolen his credit. Yet, the Jie Clansmen blindly believed Jie Zhou and insulted Chu Feng.</span><br><span>The Jie Clansmen suddenly realized just how dumb they had been.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I would have never thought that Jie Zhou was such a shameless person.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Ling Clansmen were also surprised to learn that Jie Zhou was such a despicable person. The latter had always talked about contributing to their brethren and the Seven </span><span>Realms Sacred Mansion, but it turned out that the only thing he really cared about was himself.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That frost woman doesn&rsquo;t look like a simple formation. She seems to possess sentience, and she feels unfathomably strong. How could there be such an existence in the Ancient Palace?&rdquo;</span><br><span>On the other hand, Bai Yunqing, Ling Mo&rsquo;er, and Ling Sheng&rsquo;er were much more interested in the frost woman. They suddenly realized that the Ancient Palace might be more formidable than they had previously thought.</span><br><span>The frost woman turned to Jie Zhou and said, &ldquo;It doesn't matter whether your attitude is sincere or not. You aren&rsquo;t the key to determining whether you and your brethren can survive this ordeal. Rather, it all lies on him.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The frost woman waved her sleeves, and a wave of frost rushed into the sky and formed a projection. The projection followed a single person&mdash;Chu Feng.</span><br><span>He was swiftly flitting across the ice domain while constructing and breaching formations. In his background were humongous beasts, raining swords, and all kinds of powerful slaughter formations. The environment he was in was clearly much more dangerous than theirs.</span><br><span>Any one of these formations could have rendered them utterly helpless and killed them. Yet, Chu Feng was able to deal with them one by one.</span><br><span>Even though the situation looked dangerous, he was always able to resolve every crisis that came his way through ingenious means.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is Chu Feng really advancing in such an environment?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Both the Jie Clansmen and Ling Clansmen could hardly believe their eyes. Even Ling Mo&rsquo;er was stunned too.</span><br><span>They had known that Chu Feng was formidable, but they didn&rsquo;t know that it was to such an extent.</span><br></p></div>
