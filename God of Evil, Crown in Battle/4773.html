        <h1>Chapter 4772</h1>
        <div>: Grandma&rsquo;s Doting<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead of returning back to his residence, Chu Feng headed to the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake. He still hadn&rsquo;t resolved his grudge with Nangong Yuliu yet.<br>By the time he returned, the entire place was already completely crowded. More people had headed over to join in the commotion while he was gone.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng is back!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I told them that you were the one who controlled the phenomenon earlier, but they wouldn&rsquo;t believe me! It&rsquo;s good that you&rsquo;re back. Hurry up and show it to them!&rdquo;<br>The crowd immediately bubbled in excitement at his arrival. Some of the elders even directed him with looks of respect.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s deed was unmatched by any disciple ever since the founding of the sect. Not even the great Dugu Lingtian was able to achieve such a feat.<br>If anyone still thought that it was only luck that Chu Feng broke Dugu Lingtian&rsquo;s record on the Snowy Heavenly Peak, they were now starting to believe that it was indeed his capability.<br>In fact, some of them even began discussing if Chu Feng could really best Dugu Lingtian.<br>Due to that, the elders and the disciples didn&rsquo;t hesitate to shower Chu Feng with fawning words. They hoped to get close to him before he truly came to prominence.<br>&ldquo;Elders and fellow disciples, it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want to demonstrate it, but Lord Li has ordered me not to abuse this power carelessly. I hope for your understanding,&rdquo; Chu Feng explained.<br>In the first place, those who wanted Chu Feng to demonstrate his control over the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake were doing it so that he could reinforce his reputation, but since he was unable to do so, they had no intention of pushing the matter.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng quickly swept his glance through the crowd, but Nangong Yuliu was nowhere to be seen. It seemed like the latter had slipped away upon realizing that the situation had turned awry.<br>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anyone here who knows Nangong Yuliu, I&rsquo;ll have to trouble you to relay my words to him. While I&rsquo;m the one who won the bet, I don&rsquo;t intend to make things hard for him in view that we&rsquo;re fellow disciples of the same sect.<br>&ldquo;The reason why this started at all is due to him oppressing Senior Zhao Shi at the Hidden Dragon Martial Art Hall back then, and the condition we agreed on is that if I were to break Lord Dugu Lingtian&rsquo;s record in the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake, he would apologize to Senior Zhao Shi publicly and allow her to slap him ten times.<br>&ldquo;However, since I&rsquo;m doing this to stand up for Senior Zhao Shi, the only request from my part is for him to apologize to Senior Zhao Shi. As for the part regarding the slaps, if Senior Zhao Shi is unwilling to do it, I have no qualms about it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>The crowd nodded their heads in approval upon hearing those words.<br>They had already seen the token Nangong Yuliu had prepared for Chu Feng, and it was clear that he was intending to thoroughly humiliate Chu Feng. It was truly magnanimous of Chu Feng to say such words even after that.<br>In truth, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t doing this to spare Nangong Yuliu&rsquo;s pride. Someone of his personality couldn&rsquo;t possibly tolerate Nangong Yuliu. He was just saying all of this out of consideration for Zhao Shi.<br>He could tell that Zhao Shi was frightened of Nangong Yuliu, and if he were to push this matter, he might just end up bringing trouble to Zhao Shi instead. That was also the reason why he chose to lighten the punishment against Nangong Yuliu.<br>After that, Chu Feng returned back to the North Tortoise Hall, hoping to rest. However, the chief elder and the others were simply too delighted with the turn of events that they insisted on drinking a few cups with him.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t want to slight their kindness, so he went along with them.<br>He thought that it was a little excessive to have yet another celebration when it hadn&rsquo;t been long since the last celebration banquet ended. However, he was in a good mood since he had managed to resolve several problems, so he was willing to accompany them.<br>It didn&rsquo;t take long for the news concerning the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake to spread throughout the sect, and those words that Chu Feng said about not making things hard for Nangong Yuliu soon reached Nangong Yuliu&rsquo;s ears.<br>&ldquo;Senior Nangong, Chu Feng has risen in prominence today with his feats, but he chose to let you off. It seems like he isn&rsquo;t a bad person after all.&rdquo;<br>Nangong Yuliu and his lackeys were all gathered in his residence. They were here to console Nangong Yuliu because they thought that Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t let him off.<br>It was precisely due to such thoughts that they were overjoyed when they heard that Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t make things difficult for Nangong Yuliu.<br>This was especially so for one of the more beautiful female disciples here. She was in a relationship with Nangong Yuliu, so she was more concerned about him. Her smile was the brightest of everyone present upon hearing the news.<br>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;<br>Nangong Yuliu turned to the smiling female disciple and asked with a cold voice.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The female disciple was able to immediately sense that Nangong Yuliu&rsquo;s mood was off, causing the smile on her face to fade into nervousness.<br>Pah!<br>Before she could say a word, Nangong Yuliu raised his arm and planted a slap on the female disciple&rsquo;s face, causing her to tumble onto the ground.<br>The sheer force of the slap tore open a laceration on her face, causing her cheeks to bleed profusely.<br>However, Nangong Yuliu&rsquo;s rage wasn&rsquo;t placated with just this.<br>&ldquo;You said that Chu Feng is going to let me off? What rights does he have to let me off? Who does he think he is? How dare you laugh? Are you that happy that Chu Feng is doing well now? Shit, was it Chu Feng who sent you over to my side?!&rdquo;<br>Nangong Yuliu hurled kicks and punches onto the female disciple as he spoke. In just a short instant, the beautiful disciple was completely disfigured.<br>Yet, no one present dared to step forward to stop him. It was not that they didn&rsquo;t want to do so but they dared not to. They feared that they would be implicated here.<br>Nangong Yuliu was simply too frustrated that he wanted to vex his emotions. The female disciple was already severely injured, but he had no intention of giving it a rest.<br>Pah!<br>But all of a sudden, a palm reached forth and grabbed Nangong Yuliu&rsquo;s fist. The angry Nangong Yuliu was enraged that someone was trying to stop him, so he raised his arm to strike the other party.<br>However, when he finally caught a closer look at the other party&rsquo;s face, he gasped in shock and hurriedly backed away before bowing deeply.<br>&ldquo;Grandmother&hellip;&rdquo;<br>It turned out that the person who stopped him was no other than his grandmother, Nangong Chunyue!<br>&ldquo;Are you intending to kill her? What&rsquo;s becoming of you to vent your rage on a woman after losing a bet?&rdquo; Nangong Chunyue questioned sternly.<br>Nangong Yuliu knew that he was at fault here, so he lowered his head silently.<br>However, Nangong Chunyue didn&rsquo;t punish Nangong Yuliu for this. She took out a couple of valuable medicine and passed it over to the severely injured female disciple.<br>&ldquo;All of you may leave now. Remember&hellip; you aren&rsquo;t to speak of the matters today.&rdquo;<br>Naturally, the other lackeys dared not to disobey the orders from someone of Nangong Chunyue&rsquo;s stature. They quickly bowed deeply before dragging the severely injured female disciple out.<br>With this, the only ones left in the room were Nangong Chunyue and Nangong Yuliu.<br>&ldquo;Grandmother, are you fine?&rdquo; Nangong Yuliu asked concernedly.<br>Nangong Yuliu knew that Protector Qi only helped him in view of his grandmother, and his grandmother had headed over to meet the sectmaster together with Li Fengxian earlier.<br>Naturally, he was afraid that his grandmother would be implicated in this matter.<br>&ldquo;What could possibly happen to me?&rdquo;<br>Nangong Chunyue took a seat and poured herself a cup of tea. Her attitude was so relaxed that it was as if nothing had happened at all.<br>&ldquo;Then&hellip; what about Protector Qi?&rdquo; Nangong Yuliu asked.<br>&ldquo;Protector Qi has been stripped of his position. He&rsquo;ll be reflecting on his own actions in the sectmaster&rsquo;s residence for the time being,&rdquo; Nangong Chunyue said.<br>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t going to be punished even with the evidence in place? Grandmother, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>Nangong Yuliu was surprised by how lenient the sectmaster&rsquo;s verdict was.<br>He thought that it was already a huge blessing for his grandmother not to be implicated in this matter, and that Protector Qi was doomed for sure. Yet, everything was much better than he had expected.<br>&ldquo;Protector Qi has worked in the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect for many years and achieved significant merits. How could the sectmaster possibly punish him severely for a disciple who had just joined the sect not too long ago?&rdquo; Nangong Chunyue said.<br>&ldquo;But grandmother, that Chu Feng is a person with great means. He seems to have really gained control over the Blackwater Sixfinger Lake&rsquo;s powers!&rdquo; Nangong Yuliu said.<br>&ldquo;Yuliu, having talent is a good thing, but being too conspicuous when you don&rsquo;t have the strength to protect yourself is nothing short of foolishness,&rdquo; Nangong Chunyue said.<br>&ldquo;Does this mean that Chu Feng has gotten himself in trouble?&rdquo;<br>Nangong Yuliu sensed that there was something deeper to his grandmother&rsquo;s remark, but he couldn&rsquo;t fully figure out what it was.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out soon enough,&rdquo; Nangong Chunyue said with a gleeful smile. However, she quickly changed her tone and asked, &ldquo;I heard that you issued a challenge to Li Muzhi?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Grandmother, I need to return the humiliation I suffered. No matter what it takes, I&rsquo;ll reclaim my position as a Hidden Dragon Disciple!&rdquo; Nangong Yuliu said.<br>&ldquo;Take this and hide it inside your dantian. Only use it when it&rsquo;s necessary.&rdquo;<br>Nangong Chunyue took out an exquisite box and handed it over to Nangong Yuliu. The latter took the box and opened it. His lips immediately curled in delight.<br>&ldquo;Thanks, grandmother!&rdquo;<br>He wasn&rsquo;t confident of dealing with Li Muzhi at the start, but with this object, there was nothing to fear anymore. He would surely be able to repay the debt without a hitch!<br>Nangong Chunyue was also heartened to see how happy Nangong Yuliu was. It wasn&rsquo;t easy for her to acquire this object, but she felt that it was all worth it upon seeing the smile on her grandson&rsquo;s face.<br></p></div>
