        <h1>Chapter 4455</h1>
        <div>: Moving the Crowd<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Have you thought it through yet? What is your decision?&rdquo;<br>After the surroundings fell completely silent, the bizarre-looking woman finally turned her gaze back to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I have made up my mind,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br>The bizarre-looking woman narrowed her eyes. Even though Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t revealed his decision yet, she could already tell what his choice was just by hearing the resolve behind his tone.<br>&ldquo;Looks like you&rsquo;re intending to save them. Fine, who do you intend to save? I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;ll pose a huge problem if you wish to save that woman over there.&rdquo;<br>The bizarre-looking woman shot a glance at Long Xiaoxiao as she spoke.<br>Listening to the conversation between the two, the crowd felt as if their hearts were going to leap out of their mouths.<br>Indeed. If Chu Feng had to choose someone to save, it would definitely be no other than Long Xiaoxiao. However, if that was his choice, it would mean that the rest of them were going to die.<br>&ldquo;Elder, my greed knows no bounds. I wish to save everyone here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Ba dum!<br>It wasn&rsquo;t just the bizarre-looking woman. Every single person listening had a flabbergasted look on his face.<br>Those words jolted everyone&rsquo;s hearts.<br>Even those who had been pleading for Chu Feng to save them were taken aback by the situation as well. They had never expected Chu Feng to really attempt to save them.<br>Did their sincerity somehow touch Chu Feng, or was Chu Feng the reincarnation of a Buddha?<br>Despite the grudges they had before, he still couldn&rsquo;t turn a blind eye to their plight. No one could have expected that Chu Feng was such a kind person.<br>&ldquo;You wish to save everyone? Did you not hear my words clearly? Very well, allow me to reiterate it for your sake.<br>&ldquo;If you wish to save someone, you need to undergo a trial. However, the difficulty of the trial will be proportionate to the number of people you wish to save. If you intend to survive the trial, your best bet is to select just one person to save. Even if you choose just five people, I can tell you that the fate awaiting you is death. And despite all of this, you wish to save everyone?&rdquo; the bizarre-looking woman asked.<br>&ldquo;Is the trial that hard?&rdquo;<br>Hearing the words from the bizarre-looking woman, the hope that had just reignited in the hearts of the crowd extinguished yet again.<br>It was one thing for Chu Feng to be willing to save them, but it was another thing whether Chu Feng had the ability to pull it off or not.<br>If they had been in Chu Feng&rsquo;s position, they wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered taking on such risk for the sake of people who were unrelated to them.<br>Yet, Chu Feng spoke up once more, &ldquo;I know that I&rsquo;m lacking, but I still wish to give it a try.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How many people do you intend to save?&rdquo;<br>The bizarre-looking woman seemed unwilling to let the matter pass just like that, so she asked once more in seek of clarification.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, elder,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>The bizarre-looking lady flared up at Chu Feng after hearing that he was still obstinately sticking to his previous decision.<br>&ldquo;I will put it out to you frankly. If you fail, none of them will survive either. They will only survive if you successfully clear the trial. If you choose just the woman and her parents, you might still stand a chance. However, if you insist on saving all of them, your arrogance will just lead to everyone&rsquo;s death.<br>&ldquo;Young man, there should be a limit to your recklessness. Your actions will only inflict suffering on both you and your loved ones,&rdquo; the bizarre-looking woman told Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, calm down and think things through!&rdquo; a furious howl sounded from the crowd.<br>It was from the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>He wanted to send a voice transmission to advise Chu Feng not to save everyone, and that it was simply not worth it for him to make such a decision. However, to his astonishment, he realized that he couldn&rsquo;t use voice transmission here at all, and even whispering wasn&rsquo;t working either.<br>Watching as Chu Feng was walking closer and closer to his doom, he could only shout loudly to stop him.<br>&ldquo;Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, aren&rsquo;t you being too selfish over here? Do our lives mean nothing to you at all?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, young friend Chu Feng has already made up his mind. You have no right to interfere with his decision!&rdquo;<br>The words of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief immediately incurred the rebuke from the other powerhouses.<br>They could see through the intentions of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Simply said, the latter wanted to live, so he hoped that Chu Feng would choose to save just the lot of them.<br>It was just that he was not the only one who wanted to live here.<br>&ldquo;Shut your mouths. None of you have any place to speak here. If anyone squeaks out a single word from this point onward, I&rsquo;ll have him killed on the spot!&rdquo; the bizarre-looking woman roared furiously at the crowd.<br>Her bellow caused the air to tremor, and cracks appeared all over the granite ground.<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the Supreme Elders of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect, and the other powerhouses present felt like their heads were going to split apart from her voice.<br>It was as if the bizarre-looking woman was frustrated by Chu Feng&rsquo;s incomprehensible actions, but she was unable to flare up at Chu Feng. So, she was venting her rage at the crowd instead.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I&rsquo;m grateful for your advice, but I would still like to give it a try,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Fine. Since your mind is already made up, I&rsquo;ll fulfill your wish!&rdquo;<br>Shoosh!<br>The bizarre-looking woman raised her arm, and the space behind her began to warp.<br>A massive elliptical crimson spirit formation gate rose behind her. It was more a thousand meters tall, towering like a mountain before the crowd. Due to its elliptical shape, it deeply resembled an eye placed vertically on the ground.<br>Its crimson color made it look as if fresh blood was oozing out from it.<br>As soon as the spirit formation gate appeared, cries of agony, screams of anguish, roars of fury, and all sorts of malevolent voices could be heard in the surroundings.<br>It was so disturbing that it disorientated one&rsquo;s mind.<br>And all of this sound was coming from within the spirit formation gate.<br>Even though the crowd was unable to peer through the spirit formation gate to see what lay beyond, just the sounds themselves were enough to scare the living daylights out of most of them.<br>Rather than leading into a trial, it felt like the spirit formation gate led straight to the deepest level of hell.<br>&ldquo;Little benefactor, there&rsquo;s no need to put yourself at risk for us!&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao suddenly cried out at this moment.<br>Even though she knew that she could be punished by that bizarre-looking woman for speaking up at this point, she simply couldn&rsquo;t stand it. She felt like her heart was going to burst, and she knew that she would regret it if she didn&rsquo;t speak up now.<br>Even the thought of Chu Feng losing her life was enough to plunge her into despair.<br>&ldquo;Xiaoxiao, trust me. I&rsquo;ll save you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng turned around and flashed Long Xiaoxiao a confident smile to reassure her before making his way toward the terrifying spirit formation gate.<br>Same as the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother, the energy that shrouded the crowd didn&rsquo;t limit his movements. He passed right through the encirclement of energy without any trouble.<br>Every single gaze in this blood-red world was focused on Chu Feng at this very moment, be it Long Xiaoxiao who was worried for Chu Feng, Yin Daifen who abhorred Chu Feng, or the elders who had a deep appreciation for Chu Feng&rsquo;s talents.<br>Everyone was staring at Chu Feng&rsquo;s back, watching him approaching closer and closer to the spirit formation gate.<br>As his back grew smaller and smaller, they began to feel heavier and heavier inside.<br>There were many here whom Chu Feng was not acquainted with, but even they couldn&rsquo;t help but feel worried for him.<br>Despite Chu Feng&rsquo;s talents, he was just a mere junior at the moment. Putting aside the Holy Light Clan, there were already plenty of people present here who were stronger than Chu Feng.<br>Yet, all of them were entrusting their hopes onto the shoulders of this young man at this very moment.<br>The young man could have chosen to blind a blind eye to their plight, but he decided to put his life on the line in an attempt to save all of them.<br>This decisiveness; this compassion; this righteousness&hellip;<br>The cultivators here looked deep into their hearts, and none of them could say that they would have been able to make the same decision as him.<br>Or else, they wouldn&rsquo;t have failed the trial in the first place and landed themselves in such a state.<br>As Chu Feng was going to take the final step into the terrifying spirit gate formation, there was no heart here that wasn&rsquo;t beating wildly, be it those from the Yu Heavenly Clan, Cloudsky Immortal Sect, Monstrous Herd Temple, or Dragon Clan.<br>They were moved by this gesture, but more than that, they felt ashamed of themselves.<br>Regardless of how they viewed him in the past, it was a fact that the young man was going to march right through the gates of hell for their sake.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, regardless of whether we can walk out of here alive, our Yu Heavenly Clan will never forget the grace you have shown to us.&rdquo;<br>A person amidst the crowd suddenly shouted out&mdash;the Yu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, if we manage to leave this place alive, our Monstrous Herd Temple will be your loyal ally. If anyone dares to lay a finger on you, we will not let him off easily!&rdquo;<br>Following that, the Monstrous Herd Temple&rsquo;s sectmaster spoke up as well.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you have saved Elder Gongsun, and you&rsquo;re a good friend of Yin Zhuanghong too. We have already considered ourselves as your friend. If you face any trouble in the future, our Cloudsky Immortal Sect will surely go to all lengths to redress your grievances!&rdquo;<br>The Supreme Elders of the Cloudsky Immortal Sect chirped in too.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, if we manage to escape from here together, I&rsquo;ll betroth my daughter to you.&rdquo;<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief declared.<br>&ldquo;Ah?!&rdquo;<br>Those words caused everyone to turned their gazes toward the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Even Long Xiaoxiao turned over to glare at her father with a reddened face, exclaiming, &ldquo;Father, what are you talking about?&rdquo;<br>Hearing all of those words, Chu Feng halted his footstep. He turned around to look at the crowd and said, &ldquo;To all of the elders gathered here, allow me to make a solemn vow to you here. Today, I&rsquo;ll bring all of you out of here safely.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng clasped his fist at the crowd before finally stepping through the blood-red spirit formation gate decisively.<br></p></div>
