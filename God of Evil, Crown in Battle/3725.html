        <div> - Chu Lingxi Giving Up<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Senior, can we stop in the middle of the tempering process?&rdquo; The reason why Chu Feng asked this was because his battle against Linghu Hongfei was in less than three months&rsquo; time.<br>Thus, Chu Feng did not have that much time to spend there. He could not continue with the tempering process nonstop.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s best to not stop midway. If you do that, it&rsquo;ll end up affecting you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, if you insist on stopping midway, that&rsquo;s not impossible either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With this old man here, even if there&rsquo;s some issues, I will be able to fix them for you two,&rdquo; the Ox-nosed Old Daoist said as he patted his chest.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to trouble senior then.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng closed his eyes and began to focus wholly on tempering his body.<br>Chu Lingxi also did the same.<br>After the two of them began to temper their bodies, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist also sat down cross-legged. Spirit power began to emit from his body. His spirit power enveloped Chu Feng and Chu Lingxi.<br>Chu Feng was able to sense that the black liquid indeed changed once the Ox-nosed Old Daoist released his spirit power to envelop them. The speed at which it began assimilating with Chu Feng increased rapidly. Furthermore, the process of assimilation was very smooth.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was rapidly being transformed.<br>Even though this was not an increase in cultivation, and Chu Feng was unable to sense any benefits from the assimilation of the black liquid, he was able to clearly sense his body changing.<br>And that was still not the most important aspect. Most importantly, Chu Feng discovered that the spirit power emitted by the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was no ordinary spirit power.<br>This sort of spirit power would end up exhausting and leaving behind detrimental effects to the Ox-nosed Old Daoist.<br>It could be said that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist was causing harm to himself to increase Chu Feng and Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s tempering speed.<br>Although this sort of exhaustion was not extremely serious, he would end up paying quite considerably should he maintain it for an extended period of time.<br>&ldquo;Senior, is this really fine?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Focus on assimilating the power of the holy water, do not be distracted.&rdquo; urged the Ox-noed Old Daoist.<br>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no but. Do not waste this old man&rsquo;s power." said the Ox-nosed Old Daoist. His tone was even slightly angry.<br>Likely, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist knew what Chu Feng was planning to say.<br>With that being the case, Chu Feng said no more, and began to wholly focus on comprehending and assimilating with the power of the black liquid.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Normally, tempering one&rsquo;s body in such a manner would take at least three months.<br>However, Chu Feng only used thirty days to complete the tempering process.<br>After he finished the first step, Chu Feng began the second step.<br>The second step was much more difficult than the first step.<br>It could even be said that the second step was very painful.<br>The reason for that was because for the second step&hellip; Chu Feng needed to forcibly create a separate space in his soul.<br>He must repeatedly tear open his own soul and accurately establish an isolated space. Not even the slightest mistake could be allowed.<br>It was akin to a sculptor seeking to carve a perfect piece of art.<br>However, the work of art was unable to sense pain. Chu Feng, on the other hand, was capable of sensing pain.<br>Chu Feng was both the sculptor and the piece of art.<br>He must make himself perfect. However, in the process of doing so, he would bring forth great pain upon himself.<br>Furthermore, this could only be accomplished by Chu Feng. No one would be able to help him.<br>As such, whenever Chu Feng tore open his soul, he would feel great pain. The entire process was very difficult to accomplish.<br>However, for the sake of obtaining greater strength, for the sake of giving new life to the Four Symbols Sacred Beasts, Chu Feng stubbornly clenched his teeth and persisted through the pain.<br>After forty-five days had passed from the day they began, Chu Lingxi also completed the first step.<br>As the second step was conducted in another palace hall, Chu Feng and Chu Lingxi had been separated for fifteen days.<br>Chu Feng did not know that Chu Lingxi had successfully completed the first step.<br>He was still completely focused on establishing a space in his soul.<br>Screams, anguished wailing and all sorts of miserable sounds were echoing through the palace hall nonstop.<br>It sounded like a place of torture.<br>It seemed like criminals were being tortured in the palace hall.<br>Indeed, someone was being tortured. However, the person that was being tortured was not a criminal. Instead, Chu Feng was torturing himself.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s willpower was very strong. Whenever he began tearing open a space in his soul, he would continue until he could not withstand the pain anymore.<br>The current Chu Feng was completely drenched in ice-cold sweat. There was so much sweat that it seemed like he'd been rained upon by a torrential rain.<br>Chu Feng was deathly pale. The rims of his eyes were completely black, and his lips were purple. Even his body was involuntarily shivering.<br>&ldquo;Huu~~~&rdquo;<br>After stopping, Chu Feng heaved a long sigh of relief.<br>The process was simply unbearable. Even someone with such strong willpower like Chu Feng had reached his limit.<br>Upon reaching his limit, he had to quickly recuperate. Only when his body had returned to it's optimal condition would he continue.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, why are you doing all this?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice sounded from the palace hall.<br>Chu Feng looked to the voice, and discovered that Chu Lingxi was actually standing in the palace hall.<br>At that moment, Chu Lingxi was standing in the palace hall nearby and looking at Chu Feng. There was an expression of utter pain on her face.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, you&rsquo;ve also completed the tempering process?&rdquo; Seeing Chu Lingxi, Chu Feng revealed a look of joy.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. However, I&rsquo;m planning to give up.&rdquo; said Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Give up? Why? Ordinary people needed a hundred years to complete the tempering process. Even the fastest would take three months. Yet you, it only took you forty-five days, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, you&rsquo;ve already proved your talent. As long as you persist, you will definitely succeed.&rdquo; Chu Feng immediately spoke to dissuade Chu Lingxi from giving up.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you really believe him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My mother and Grandmaster Liangqiu have already told me that the Ox-nosed Old Daoist is a scam.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After personally experiencing it myself, I also feel that his method is unreliable.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you should also give up. My mother and Grandmaster Liangqiu wouldn&rsquo;t possibly lie to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While that tempering process is still fine, what was it that you experienced just then? You actually really believe in his words, and are damaging your own soul?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Have you never suspected him? Do you not think that he&rsquo;s deceiving you?&rdquo;<br>Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s eyes were already moist when she asked those words. She was truly feeling pained for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, the person who wanted me to find Senior Daoist is actually my father.&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior Chu Xuanyuan?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s expression changed upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. My father said that Senior Daoist was capable of helping me fuse with my Divine Power. My father wouldn&rsquo;t possibly lie to me &rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;But, my mother wouldn&rsquo;t possible lie to you either. Grandmaster Liangqiu wouldn&rsquo;t possibly lie to you either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Forget about it. Since you&rsquo;re so determined to continue, there&rsquo;s nothing that I can do. After all, you will definitely believe Senior Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s words without any doubt. I also do not wish to call him into question.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That being said, regardless of whether or not the Ox-nosed Old Daoist really has the ability to assimilate Divine Power into one&rsquo;s body or not, I do not wish to continue.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided to give up. It is impossible for me to torture myself the way you&rsquo;re torturing yourself. Thus, you don&rsquo;t have to try to persuade me.&rdquo; Chu Lingxi said to Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
