        <div>: Chu Lingxi Is Forced Into a Marriage<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Hai, it&rsquo;s our fault. We shouldn&rsquo;t have allowed Lingxi to do as she pleased and participate in this tournament. If we hadn&rsquo;t come here, we wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten into this mess,&rdquo; Gu Yang replied with a look of remorse.<br>&ldquo;Elder, what happened? You need to tell me what happened for me to be able to help,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Gu Yang exhaled deeply out of helplessness before he began recounting how it all started.<br>After the battle between Chu Feng and the Linghu Heavenly Clan, Chu Lingxi and her mother returned back to the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan.<br>In a bid to raise her cultivation, Chu Lingxi made a decision.<br>As someone who possessed both the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;s bloodline and the Heavenly Bloodline, she decided to seal off her Heavenly Bloodline and focus her effort on developing her Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;s bloodline. This way, she would be able to raise her cultivation much faster.<br>In truth, the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;s bloodline that Chu Lingxi possessed was far stronger than her Heavenly Bloodline. It was simply out of her previous aversion for the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan that she chose to focus on her Heavenly Bloodline, resulting in her failing to maximize her potential.<br>And over the years of her neglect, her Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan&rsquo;s bloodline had also accumulated a humongous amount of power too.<br>Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s decision proved to be the right one as her cultivation did grow extremely swiftly after her decision.<br>Within a short span of time, she had managed to raise her cultivation up to rank nine Exalted level cultivator.<br>With such a level of cultivation, she could already be considered as a fairly powerful expert across the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, possibly one of the top juniors.<br>It just so happened that Chu Lingxi heard of the tournament held by the Holy Light Clan at this moment, and she was drawn to the idea of participating in the tournament.<br>Of course, she understood that while her cultivation was considered to be formidable in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, it was still far from sufficient for her to achieve any good results in such a high-level tournament that spanned the entire Holy Light Galaxy. Nevertheless, she was hoping to rake in some experience and expand her horizons through the tournament.<br>Gu Mingyuan was fully supportive of this idea of hers too.<br>As such, Chu Lingxi, Gu Mingyuan, and a few experts of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan made their way over to this Storm Realm.<br>However, they never expected that as soon as they stepped out of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s teleportation formation, they would meet that person.<br>Lu Wantong.<br>Lu Wantong was a prophet. While his prophecies were not as clear as those of the All-seeing Heavenly Master, the disciple of the Dao Enlightenment Sage Exalted, the prophecies he made were still viewed very highly.<br>Due to his skills as a prophet, Lu Wantong was a partner to many major powers in the Holy Light Galaxy, which meant that he had great connections and a strong background here.<br>And even if one were to put aside his frightening connections, he, himself, was also a powerful rank five Utmost Exalted level cultivator. Such a person was not someone whom the current Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan could afford to offend.<br>But sometimes, even if you don&rsquo;t go courting for trouble, trouble will still knock on your door.<br>Lu Wantong was moved from the moment he caught sight of Chu Lingxi, so he tried to approach her.<br>Of course, Chu Lingxi and Gu Mingyuan turned him down, but who could have thought that Lu Wantong refused to give up just like that?<br>He made an ultimatum, declaring that Chu Lingxi had to marry him within seven days or else he would make sure that the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan would be obliterated from the face of the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>This ultimatum inevitably frightened those from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan.<br>This was also the reason why Elder Gu Yang was calling Chu Feng over to have to talk to Chu Lingxi too.<br>&ldquo;Elder Gu, what do you want me to say to Lingxi then?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng immediately caught Gu Yang&rsquo;s drift, such that his tone was slowly growing less polite and more wintry.<br>However, Gu Yang was too caught up with himself to notice the changes occurring to Chu Feng. He simply took Chu Feng&rsquo;s words at face-value and assumed that the latter was willing to help them convince Chu Lingxi, and a relieved smile broke out of his face.<br>&ldquo;It goes without saying that you should advise Lingxi to marry Lu Wantong!<br>&ldquo;That man is not someone whom we can afford to offend. If Lingxi continues to turn him down, not only will she be put under great stress, our Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan could possibly be destroyed as well!<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how relieved I am to have been able to meet you here, young friend Chu Feng. I know that you are on close terms with Lingxi. I&rsquo;m confident that she&rsquo;ll listen to your words!&rdquo;<br>Gu Yang&rsquo;s face was smiling brightly as he said those words. He was simply relieved to have found his savior at a time like this, or else things could have really ended badly!<br>&ldquo;How in the world are you able to bring yourself to force your kin into misery just so that you can save your own skin?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a chilling voice.<br>It was only upon those words were spoken that Gu Yang noticed that Chu Feng&rsquo;s attitude was a little different from what he imagined it to be.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, are you&hellip; unwilling to talk to Lingxi on our behalf?&rdquo; Gu Yang probed carefully.<br>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t allow anyone to force Lingxi to do what she dislikes,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied sharply.<br>&ldquo;Is that so? Hehehe&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The politeness abruptly dropped from Gu Yang&rsquo;s voice, and a cold sneer escaped from his lips. He halted his footsteps and said, &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, if you aren&rsquo;t willing to help us on this matter, I&rsquo;ll have to ask you to leave.&rdquo;<br>His message was very clear&mdash;Chu Feng shouldn&rsquo;t even dream of meeting Chu Lingxi if he wouldn&rsquo;t help them convince her on this matter.<br>Boom!<br>But barely after Gu Yang spoke those words, the surroundings suddenly grew freezingly cold.<br>Strong wind and snow were common occurrences in the Storm Realm, resulting in its low temperature all year round.<br>With Gu Yang&rsquo;s peak Exalted level cultivation, he was able to maneuver around this world without being affected by the low temperature. But all of a sudden, the temperature plummeted to a level where it felt like the coldness itself was a weapon that was piercing into his skin to freeze him alive.<br>It was completely unbearable even for a cultivator like him. At this rate, it wouldn&rsquo;t take long for him to turn into a snowman.<br>But why would the surroundings suddenly grow so freezingly cold?<br>Gu Yang couldn&rsquo;t understand what was going on.<br>It was then that Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice sounded once more, enlightening him to the truth.<br>&ldquo;If not on the account that you&rsquo;re an elder of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan, you would have been a dead corpse by now.&rdquo;<br>As it turned out, the chilling air was released by Chu Feng as a warning to Gu Yang.<br>Gu Yang stiffly turned to look at Chu Feng, and in the young man&rsquo;s eyes, he saw overflowing killing intent that nearly froze his blood.<br>&ldquo;D-don&rsquo;t kill me. I&rsquo;m just considering the future of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan! You also know that we can&rsquo;t afford to offend someone of Lu Wantong&rsquo;s standing!&rdquo;<br>Finally realizing the position he was in, Gu Yang immediately kneeled down before Chu Feng and began wailing out of fright.<br>Chu Feng glared at Gu Yang for a moment longer before finally reining in his killing intent.<br>&ldquo;Lead the way,&rdquo; Chu Feng ordered.<br>Given the current state of affairs, how could Gu Yang possibly dare to disobey Chu Feng? He quickly led the way forth.<br>A while later, they finally arrived at the entrance of a city.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, my clan members are all there,&rdquo; Gu Yang pointed into the city as he said.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s face slowly turned livid in displeasure as he looked at the city.<br>He could tell that the city was constructed using spirit power. It was the means of a Dragon-mark Saint Cloak World Spiritist, and he knew that Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan didn&rsquo;t have such a world spiritist amongst them.<br>Other than that, he also noticed that there were a few cultivators lurking in the shadows around the city, and none of them were from the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan.<br>To put it in other words, this was a cage that Lu Wantong prepared for the Ten Thousand Provicnes Ancient Clan so as to ensure that they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to escape.<br>&ldquo;Lu Wantong, I sure would like to see just what kind of formidable figure you are to dare coerce our Lingxi to serve as your concubine.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng harrumphed coldly as he began making his way toward the city.<br></p></div>
