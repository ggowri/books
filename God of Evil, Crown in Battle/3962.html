        <h1>Chapter 3961</h1>
        <div> - Condescending<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Logically, Bai Lulu speaking to Ouyang Pingzhi in such a manner before all those people was simply akin to slapping him in the face.<br>Such a thing would put him on the spot.<br>Yet, not only was Ouyang Pingzhi not angry, he instead smiled.<br>That smile of his appeared so very pampering.<br>Yet, Chu Feng was able to see a different sort of thing from his smile.<br>Ouyang Pingzhi&rsquo;s smile was more like a smile of a ferocious beast that had locked onto its prey.<br>To Ouyang Pingzhi, Bai Lulu was prey. Furthermore, Ouyang Pingzhi was absolutely confident in being able to capture his prey.<br>&ldquo;Clamor~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a commotion suddenly sounded from outside the palace.<br>Looking toward the sounds, one could see multiple silhouettes appearing from the direction of the All-heaven Sect.<br>They were walking on air, and appeared very majestic.<br>Not only was the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s Supreme Elder Tuoba Chengan among them, but there were also several other old men with auras on par with Tuoba Chengan.<br>Those grand existences all stood behind a seemingly middle-aged man like stars cupping themselves around the moon.<br>That man was very imposing, and gave off an extraordinary air. One could tell from a single glance that he was someone extraordinary.<br>Even without others telling him, Chu Feng was able to guess that the man must be the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, the strongest expert of the All-heaven Starfield.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, welcome to our All-heaven Sect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let us jointly witness the grand occasion unfolding here today.&rdquo;<br>After the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster appeared, he first clasped his fist and greeted the crowd.<br>As for the crowd, regardless of whether they were powers from the All-heaven Starfield or from the five other starfields, they all returned the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster&rsquo;s etiquette.<br>After a simple exchange of pleasantries, the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster spoke of the day's main topic.<br>He revealed to the crowd what sort of grand occasion they would be witnessing.<br>The reason for that was because apart from the All-heaven Sect and the other five overlord powers, the remainder of the crowd had no idea why the All-heaven Sect had invited them over.<br>After hearing the explanation provided by the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, the crowd finally realized what the grand occasion was about.<br>Thinking that they would soon witness the younger generations of six starfields&rsquo; overlords competing, the crowd was filled with even more anticipation.<br>Then, the sectmaster of the All-heaven Sect and the leaders of the five overlord powers all left their spectator&rsquo;s grandstand and arrived at the center of the vast plaza.<br>At that moment, the All-heaven Sect, Miao Heavenly Clan, Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion, Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain, Wind Lightning Sword Sect and Inferno Academy...<br>...the leaders of the six great overlord powers had all appeared before the crowd.<br>Although the appearances of the other five leaders were all different, even though they all had different sorts of airs, none of them appeared weaker than the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>In terms of the airs that they emitted, those six people were all experts of the same tier.<br>However, the focus of the crowd was not on the six grand existences.<br>The reason for that was because the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had taken out a case.<br>That case was made of stone. It appeared very simple, unadorned and not special in the slightest. The only seemingly interesting aspect about the case would be its five vacant spots.<br>After the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster took out the case, the other five leaders placed their hands on their Cosmos Sacks. Then, a stone appeared in each of their hands.<br>Those stones were a perfect fit for the holes in the case.<br>Witnessing the five leaders placing the five stones into the case, the crowd started to become excited.<br>However, the sight that they were anticipating did not occur.<br>Originally, they thought that some sort of issue had occurred.<br>However, they discovered that the six leaders were very calm and unperturbed by the situation at hand.<br>They had all left the center of the plaza and entered the main viewing platform together.<br>After taking their seats, they glanced at each other, and then formed hand seals together.<br>Then, they pointed to the stone case.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, a dazzling light emerged.<br>That dazzling light came from the location of the stone case.<br>The light began to spread and sweep across the horizon. In an instant, it completely engulfed the area.<br>That light was simply too dazzling. It was so dazzling that many people present were only able to see a vast expanse of white and nothing else. This was the case for even Chu Feng.<br>That said, the dazzling light did not last for long. Soon, the light dissipated. Once it did, the crowd were able to see that the case was still present.<br>However, the stone case was now open.<br>After the case opened, it released six pillars of light.<br>Among them, five pillars of light were five spirit formation gates.<br>The five spirit formation gates were like five guards standing around the stone pillar.<br>As for the other pillar of light, it shot straight towards the sky.<br>After reaching the sky, it started spreading, and actually formed a giant net in the sky.<br>The net covering the sky was changing nonstop. When it finally stopped changing, the crowd were able to tell that it was actually an enormous map.<br>The map showed plants, trees, mountains, rivers and creeks. Everything on the map appeared like a real world.<br>That said, even though the map covered the sky and extended to an enormous range, the contents of the map had shrunk multiple times.<br>The map was a mirror image. Likely, it showed the world of the treasure.<br>This caused the spectators to become very excited.<br>They already knew that once the people of the younger generation entered that treasure&rsquo;s world, they would be able to witness their every action inside through the mirror map above them.<br>With this, they would be able to see clearly who was stronger among them, and what each of them obtained.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? The image seems to be changing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. It really is changing. Although it&rsquo;s changing very slowly, it seems to be shrinking.&rdquo;<br>Soon, people discovered that there was an enormous pattern at the center of the mirror map. That pattern was semi-transparent, and did not block the contents of the mirror map. However, it was changing.<br>&ldquo;The respective younger generations of the six powers can come out now,&rdquo; the sectmaster of the All-heaven Sect said loudly.<br>Once he said those words, the entrances to the palaces that Chu Feng and the others were in opened suddenly.<br>Chu Feng was able to see that the palaces belonging to the five other powers had also opened.<br>Then, excitement filled the air. Cheers began sounding from every palace and every viewing platform.<br>The disciples of the six great powers had finally appeared on the scene.<br>They were walking out of their respective palaces.<br>At that moment, the strongest geniuses from six starfields had appeared before the crowd&rsquo;s vision, and were standing in rows at the plaza&rsquo;s central region.<br>The All-heaven Sect, the Miao Heavenly Clan, the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion, the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain, the Wind Lightning Sword Sect and the Inferno Academy, every one of them had dispatched a hundred disciples.<br>Chu Feng noticed that it was not only the countless gazes from all around that were sizing them up, but the disciples from the six great powers were also sizing each other up.<br>Those disciples were not only looking at each other in observation. Some among them were sending provocative gazes at others.<br>There was only a single person whose gaze did not look towards his rivals - Nangong Yifan.<br>Nangong Yifan stood tall and straight. He had a condescending look, and an attitude beyond that of simple confidence.<br>He was looking down on everyone, believing himself to be superior to all.<br>&ldquo;Sure enough, this guy came prepared.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that the All-heaven Sect is determined to win.&rdquo;<br>Seeing Nangong Yifan&rsquo;s condescending look, Chu Feng confirmed his guess.<br></p></div>
