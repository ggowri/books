        <div>: Unfair Duel<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shoosh!<br>Barely after Chu Feng steadied his body, Jiang Yuantai swiftly rushed over to launch a follow-up attack. Chu Feng quickly twisted his body to dodge the attack, but Jiang Yuantai reacted instantaneously and adapted his attack accordingly.<br>Just like the last attack, while Chu Feng was able to dodge the initial strike, he was unable to deal with the second one. There was simply too little time to react once Jiang Yuantai closed the distance between them. He could only block with his sword.<br>Clang!<br>There was a sharp reverberation as ripples of shockwaves devastated the surroundings. Chu Feng was sent flying once more, and his trembling hands were much more apparent this time around.<br>&ldquo;Oi, lad from the Nine Souls Galaxy, why are your hands trembling? Are you so weak that you can&rsquo;t even hold a sword properly?&rdquo;<br>Even though Chu Feng was able to control his trembling within moments, those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect still noticed it and mocked him for it. It was only normal for them to notice since they were all at peak Martial Exalted level, some of them even reaching Half-God level. With their cultivation, there was no way they would miss on the subtle details in the battle.<br>&ldquo;I am not from the Nine Souls Galaxy. I am from the Ancestral Martial Galaxy,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a harrumph.<br>Right after saying those words, he embarked on his counterattack. He began charging toward Jiang Yuantai with his sword in hand.<br>Jiang Yuantai revealed a disdainful look as he waited for Chu Feng to come to him. He was fully confident of his victory here.<br>Shoosh!<br>Even though Chu Feng was brandishing a wooden sword, his slash still induced a frighteningly cold aura.<br>&ldquo;That fellow&hellip;&rdquo;<br>It was at that moment that those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect finally realized that Chu Feng was not to be made light of. The might he was displaying from that single slash was not something that could have come from an ordinary rank four Martial Exalted level cultivator.<br>Even though they were competing on raw battle prowess, Chu Feng had proven himself to be an expert in close-quarter combat.<br>However, to everyone&rsquo;s shock, Jiang Yuantai didn&rsquo;t bother to dodge at all. He raised his spear and flicked it toward Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword.<br>Clang!<br>Just like that, he easily deflected Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword. At the same time, Chu Feng was also pushed back as well.<br>In contrast, Jiang Yuantai stood firmly on the spot, not moving in the slightest.<br>&ldquo;Formidable!&rdquo;<br>Tight knits showed on the faces of the Nine Souls Galaxy&rsquo;s experts. Even the Godwish Grandmother and the Lady of Dao Sea didn&rsquo;t think well of Chu Feng despite knowing how powerful he was. They could sense just how powerful Jiang Yuantai was.<br>At the very least, it was clear that there was a huge gap between Chu Feng and Jiang Yuantai even though the two of them were at the same cultivation level.<br>&ldquo;Is that all you amount to without any martial skills?&rdquo;<br>Jiang Yuantai eyed Chu Feng as if he was staring at a pitiful insect. The contemptuous nature of his gaze enraged Chu Feng.<br>Shoosh!<br>Chu Feng charged forth with his sword once more, emanating an even greater chill than before. Powered by his fury, his movements were much faster and more vigorous as compared to before.<br>Clang!<br>Yet, all it took was a sweep of Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s spear to smack Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword away. Chu Feng himself was also sent flying a distance away.<br>&ldquo;Weak.&rdquo;<br>In the few clashes they had, Jiang Yuantai had already realized that there was a huge gap between them. He began losing his patience, thinking that there was no point wasting his time on Chu Feng anymore.<br>Thus, after he sent Chu Feng flying, he took a step forward and began charging toward Chu Feng. He had decided to end this boring battle.<br>He moved at such a tremendous speed that he was already right before Chu Feng before the latter could even steady his figure.<br>Shoosh!<br>But just as he was about to propel his spear forth, Chu Feng&rsquo;s sword suddenly appeared from above and swiftly hacked down on him. This time, it moved at a speed much faster than the previous two slashes.<br>Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s eyes narrowed in astonishment. He quickly retracted his spear to block the falling sword, barely making it in time.<br>Clang!<br>The two weapons collided, but this time around, the sword felt much heavier compared to the two previous slashes. Jiang Yuantai was actually finding it hard to push it back. He could only stare in bewilderment as the sword slowly pushed his spear downward, till it started sinking into his shoulder.<br>It was only a relief that his spear had managed to redirect the trajectory of the sword a little, or else it would be slicing into his head right now.<br>&ldquo;This!!!&rdquo;<br>Those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect were flabbergasted by what they were seeing. They hadn&rsquo;t expected Chu Feng to be able to hurt Jiang Yuantai.<br>&ldquo;That fellow intentionally concealed his battle prowess. How despicable!&rdquo;<br>Jeers began sounding shortly after. They realized that Chu Feng had been intentionally holding back so as to get Jiang Yuantai to lower his guard so that he could end the fight in a single strike. In fact, his trembling hand was also an act too.<br>Clang!<br>Jiang Yuantai also realized the same too. He garnered every last bit of strength he had to push the sword off before hurriedly backing away. He was hoping to make a quick strategic retreat and get back into form before continuing the battle.<br>But the moment he started backing away, Chu Feng quickly chased him.<br>The anger in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes had vanished without a trace, left with nothing but coldness. Jiang Yuantai was starting to understand how Jiang Kongping had fallen in defeat.<br>On the other hand, Chu Feng pursued Jiang Yuantai relentlessly, not giving him any chance to catch a breather. He had put on an act thus far for this moment, so there was no way he would let Jiang Yuantai get away so easily. Since he had already revealed his strength, he wouldn&rsquo;t rest until he had Jiang Yuantai cornered and defeated.<br>&ldquo;That makes things interesting.&rdquo;<br>Surprisingly, Jiang Yuantai wasn&rsquo;t angered by Chu Feng&rsquo;s deception. Instead, a dangerous smile appeared on his face.<br>He halted his retreat and brandished his spear once more, swiftly launching a counterattack against the pursuing Chu Feng. The next moment, countless afterimages of his spear began thrusting at Chu Feng, forcing the latter to back away.<br>Jiang Yuantai pressed his attack on, forcing Chu Feng to have to deal with the many afterimages of his spear while trying to retreat.<br>The tables were turned just like that. Chu Feng had fallen into a disadvantageous position once more, possibly being even in a worse plight than before.<br>&ldquo;How could someone achieve such an astounding level of mastery in their spearmanship?&rdquo; the Godwish Grandmother exclaimed in astonishment.<br>The sheer might displayed by Jiang Yuantai left her feeling deeply worried on Chu Feng&rsquo;s behalf. This was the first time she was seeing anyone unleash such a terrifying attack, be it junior or elder. She wasn&rsquo;t confident of dealing with those attacks if she were to suppress her cultivation to rank four Martial Exalted level. Perhaps, she might even fare worse than Chu Feng.<br>She couldn&rsquo;t think of anyone who could possibly defeat Jiang Yuantai in a battle of weapons in the same cultivation rank.<br>&ldquo;Is he finally getting serious?&rdquo; Jiang Kongping murmured with a smile.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t too surprised since he knew his older brother better than anyone else.<br>Jiang Yuantai had always been fond of weapons from a young age, especially the spear. He had been specializing in spearmanship ever since he was ten years old, and their father even spent an exorbitant sum to buy a martial skill manual named the Three Souls Conqueror Spearmanship for him.<br>It was no easy feat to cultivate the Three Souls Conqueror Spearmanship.<br>The first soul enhanced one&rsquo;s strength, and the second soul enhanced one&rsquo;s speed.<br>The third soul achieved a balance of strength and speed, allowing one to set up a spear formation.<br>Jiang Yuantai spent forty years cultivating the Three Souls Conqueror Spearmanship to the third level. Following that, he devoted another twenty years to reinforce his mastery of it.<br>With a whole sixty years, he was able to fully master the Three Souls Conqueror Spearmanship and bring out its full prowess.<br>Since then, Jiang Yuantai had favored such duels. He would often suppress his cultivation to the same level as others and forbid them from raising their cultivation, using any martial skills, or resorting to any treasures. It would be a pure battle of weaponry.<br>It might appear to be a fair duel, but those who were aware of Jiang Yuantai&rsquo;s means would know better than to think that. There was no way Jiang Yuantai could lose when he had devoted sixty years of his life to master the Three Souls Conqueror Spearmanship.<br>From the very start, this had been an unfair duel!<br></p></div>
