        <h1>Chapter 5644: Mother’s Purpledemon Dagger</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd began looking for clues in the area, knowing that there had to be clues to guide their path. Everything they saw thus far seemed to come together to form a greater scheme of things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chu Feng began moving just as they finally noticed some details, though they didn&rsquo;t mind it too much since they were traveling together with him anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through his sharp observation skills, Chu Feng led the group through the trials with ease. Even the ferocious beasts they encountered later didn&rsquo;t hinder their path at all. The group was thankful that Chu Feng was here, or else they would have been dead by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, Chu Feng still continued to impress them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At some point, he suddenly picked up pace and raced in a certain direction. Not too long after, they stumbled upon an old temple, which had a teleportation formation that could bring them out of here. Clearly, he had his eyes on this temple right from the start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group entered the temple together with Chu Feng, and they were immediately teleported to a field. They could immediately feel the restriction on their flight ability lifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of them took this chance to rise into the sky, and they saw a world filled with mountains and rivers. They had been brought into a new realm. Compared to the forest filled with danger, this place looked almost like a paradise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was one exception&mdash;the southeast direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the southeast direction was a purple lightning cloud that enveloped the land. They were unable to see what was beneath the lightning cloud even when using special detection means. This left them feeling rather uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng suddenly waved his sleeves and dispelled the rope formation, terminating his connection with the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>What&rsquo;s wrong, young hero Chu Feng? Did we do something wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd panicked, thinking that Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t want to take them with him anymore. They knew that he was the only reason they were able to get here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Wait here. I&rsquo;ll scout the way,&rdquo; Chu Feng said before rising into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless people rose into the air and encircled Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Young hero Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ll come with you,&rdquo; Chu Shanshan said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others snapped out of their daze and quickly did the same too. There was not a single person who wanted to stay here without Chu Feng.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Based on what I have observed, the calm scenery we see is just a decoy. The only way out lies beneath the lightning cloud, but there&rsquo;s bound to be danger there. That&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;m heading out to scout the way,&rdquo; Chu Feng explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Young master Chu Feng, you have protected us thus far, but I wish to brave danger with you. Otherwise, my heart won&rsquo;t rest at ease,&rdquo; Chu Shanshan said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Young hero Chu Feng, that&rsquo;s how we feel too,&rdquo; the others said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>All right.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that the crowd had made up his mind, Chu Feng led them toward the lightning cloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area beneath the lightning cloud was a desert. The further they advanced into the desert, the more expansive it looked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they arrived before an altar with a dark purple dagger stabbed into it. The dagger was beautiful, and it contained great spirit power too. It was comparable to Exalted Armaments in terms of prowess, and its resilience exceeded that of Exalted Armaments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inscribed on the dagger was the name &lsquo;Jie Ranqing&rsquo;.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>That dagger looks familiar. Is it Lord Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s Purpledemon Dagger?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Yes, it&rsquo;s the Purpledemon Dagger! Why is it here?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Is it an imitation? But it doesn't feel like an imitation based on the aura.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd chattered amongst themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Young hero Chu Feng, may I take a closer look at the dagger?&rdquo; Chu Shanshan asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Go ahead,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had examined the altar and confirmed that it was safe to approach it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Shanshan and a few others walked up to the altar to examine the dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man even reached out to grab the dagger, which caused the dagger to emanate a brilliant light. The man screamed in agony and quickly released his grip. By then, his palm was already charred black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng quickly headed to the man&rsquo;s side to construct a recovery formation so as to treat him. The man&rsquo;s burns were so bad that he could lose his hand for good if he wasn&rsquo;t treated in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>You&rsquo;re out of your mind to dare touch the Purpledemon Dagger! Don&rsquo;t you know that no one else can touch the Purpledemon Dagger other than Lord Jie Ranqing?&rdquo; someone spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>I didn&rsquo;t think it was the real Purpledemon Dagger,&rdquo; the man replied with an aggrieved expression. He turned to Chu Feng and said, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Young hero Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m sorry for troubling you.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>It&rsquo;s fine. May I know what&rsquo;s the background of this Purpledemon Dagger?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man looked at Chu Feng with a shocked expression. </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Young hero Chu Feng, you&hellip; don&rsquo;t know the Purpledemon Dagger?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Shanshan immediately stepped forward and growled, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>What&rsquo;s wrong with him not knowing about the Purpledemon Dagger?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>T-that&rsquo;s not what I mean!&rdquo; The man tried to explain himself, but he was too flustered to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Calm down, I know that you don&rsquo;t bear any ill will. Why don&rsquo;t you tell me the origin of the Purpledemon Dagger?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Of course, of course.&rdquo; The man heaved a sigh of relief before sharing what he knew about the Purpledemon Dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Purpledemon Dagger was a gift the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion had specially prepared for Jie Ranqing. It was forged out of the Demon Spirit Realm&rsquo;s Purpledemon Godmetal, which was a material that was rarer than God Armaments. It made the dagger more resilient than God Armaments, making it an invaluable treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, Jie Ranqing had imprinted her name onto it using a formation such that no one else other than her could use the dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>There&rsquo;s something you got wrong,&rdquo; Chu Shanshan said. </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Lord Jie Ranqing&rsquo;s parents and her offspring are able to use the dagger too.&rdquo;</span></p></div>
