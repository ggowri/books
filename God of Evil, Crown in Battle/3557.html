        <h1>Chapter 3556</h1>
        <div> - Secretly Delighted<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that the situation was amiss, Chu Feng did not rashly approach. Instead, he took out a captured Blood-devouring Demon Clansman.<br>&ldquo;What is going on here? What happened to the people you all captured?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked sternly.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip; I also have no idea what&rsquo;s going on. I truly do not know. They were here before,&rdquo; the Blood-devouring Demon Clansman started to shiver in fear.<br>That Blood-devouring Demon Clansman had completely crumbled after Chu Feng&rsquo;s torture, and had revealed a lot of their secrets to him. Thus, Chu Feng was rather trusting of his words.<br>&lsquo;Strange. Why would they suddenly all be hidden? Could it be that the Blood-devouring Demon Clan has realized something?&rsquo; Chu Feng began to ponder in his heart. However, he was unable to determine what the reason might be.<br>Furthermore, even when using his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to observe his surroundings, he was unable to detect any clues from the empty and spacious region with the giant gate.<br>Originally, Chu Feng had wanted to release some Blood-devouring Clansmen and have them go investigate things.<br>However, he soon rejected that notion.<br>He absolutely could not release those Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen as they would only expose him.<br>&lsquo;It would appear that I can only risk it myself,&rsquo; Suddenly, Chu Feng took a leap forward. Upon landing on the vacant land, he took another jump, and landed on top of the giant gate.<br>However, when he landed on the giant gate, the giant gate and the surroundings did not have any reaction at all.<br>Thus, Chu Feng raised his foot and stomped down.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>With his stomp, the giant gate composed of branches instantly shattered. Dust immediately soared into the sky. This caused quite a bit of commotion.<br>Yet, even with that being the case, no Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen showed up.<br>Furthermore, after stomping on the gate, Chu Feng discovered that the gate was purely a gate composed of branches woven together. There was nothing else special about the gate.<br>&lsquo;It would appear that they&rsquo;ve truly changed locations,&rsquo; Chu Feng started to frown. He felt that the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen must&rsquo;ve discovered something, and thus transferred all their captives elsewhere.<br>With that being the case, not only had Chu Feng journeyed there in vain, but he also didn&rsquo;t know how to handle the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen anymore.<br>&ldquo;Which little bastard dared to destroy another&rsquo;s possession at will?!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a furious shout was heard.<br>The sudden voice caused Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart to tense up. The reason for that was because even though he heard that voice, he was still unable to sense the aura of the person who had spoken.<br>This made Chu Feng realize that the person who had spoken was extremely powerful.<br>However, after looking over in the direction of the voice, Chu Feng stood stunned.<br>There were two people at the location where the voice sounded.<br>They were one male and one female. They were both sitting on a large tree branch far away and looking at Chu Feng like they were looking at a show. There were half-eaten Sacred Tree Fruits in their hands. Their appearances were truly carefree.<br>That said, the two of them were wearing the same sort of black cloak as the other Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen.<br>It was those Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen&rsquo;s black cloaks. They were special. Not only were they capable of hiding their faces, but they were also capable of hiding their auras. If they did not intend to reveal themselves, Chu Feng would not be able to see through them either.<br>The reason why Chu Feng was able to determine that they were a man and a woman was because the two of them were not wearing their hoods, and had revealed their facial appearances.<br>Judging from the way they looked, they should not be very old. The man had a similar age to Chu Feng, whereas the woman seemed to be a bit younger than him.<br>The two of them both looked pretty good. In fact, one could even describe their looks as stunning. They were truly a handsome man and a beautiful woman.<br>That said, the man was somewhat strange. Although he was clearly a man, his face was covered in makeup.<br>Furthermore, that makeup was rather strange. It did not resemble a woman&rsquo;s makeup.<br>This was especially true for the intensely thick eyeliner. It appeared so very strange.<br>&lsquo;They couldn&rsquo;t possibly be Zhang Boyi and Zhang Shirui of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Three Geniuses, right?&rsquo; Chu Feng wondered in his heart.<br>That said, he was uncertain that the two of them were Zhang Boyi and Zhang Shirui. The reason for that was because the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen had blue skin and crimson vein lines all over their skin, making them look like monsters.<br>Yet, those two people looked very normal. Especially that woman, her skin was fair like jade, and was even giving off a luminescent shine. That skin was truly rarely-seen good skin.<br>As for the man, although his face was somewhat distinctive, Chu Feng was able to tell from a glance that it was merely makeup.<br>It was said that the people from the Blood-devouring Demon Clan all had blue skin and crimson vein lines because of the side effects caused by the Blood-devouring Demonic Technique that they trained in.<br>Thus, it made sense that if one was a Blood-devouring Demon Clansman, then one should possess blue skin and crimson vein lines.<br>&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m speaking to you. Are you deaf?&rdquo;<br>Whilst Chu Feng was thinking, that woman spoke again.<br>Her tone was very sharp, harsh, cutting, mocking and shaming.<br>In short, whenever she spoke, one would feel very displeased hearing her voice.<br>Chu Feng could be said to be someone who had a lot of experience. He had seen all sorts of people. However, this was the first time he had met someone where he felt this displeased after hearing them speak.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng felt that she must be that Zhang Shirui.<br>After all, it was said that Zhang Shirui had a naturally vicious mouth, and was able to curse people to death, forcing them to explode, using her mouth.<br>&ldquo;Wait, he seems to be Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, that man suddenly spoke.<br>&ldquo;Ah? Chu Feng?&rdquo; That woman revealed a shocked look upon hearing those words. Then, she began to carefully size Chu Feng up again.<br>&ldquo;Woah! That really is Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, that woman stood up. An incomparably excited expression appeared on her beautiful little face.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that I&rsquo;d encounter the renowned Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that you are said to be the strongest of the younger generations in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Today&hellip; allow me, Zhang Shirui, to have experience how strong you are,&rdquo; that woman cracked her knuckles and did some stretching, causing the rest of her bones to pop. She looked like she was planning to give Chu Feng a beating.<br>&ldquo;I, Zhang Boyi, also wish to experience the renowned Chu Feng,&rdquo; the man also stood up eagerly.<br>After the two of them spoke, Chu Feng was finally able to confirm their identities.<br>Sure enough, they were Zhang Boyi and Zhang Shirui of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Three Geniuses.<br>Although he didn&rsquo;t know why their skin wasn&rsquo;t blue like the rest of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen and how they knew about him, he knew that the two of them seemed to be very determined to defeat him.<br>Actually, that was indeed the case.<br>That said, Zhang Boyi and Zhang Shirui had no idea that Chu Feng was actually much more excited than the two of them.<br>&lsquo;And here I was thinking that I would have to return empty-handed. Truly, never did I expect that I would run into the two of you,&rsquo; Chu Feng was secretly delighted.<br></p></div>
