        <div> - Demonic Genius Immortal<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>[1. As in the demon-level character term used to describe absolute geniuses. The actual chinese word is Yaonie. Not a great word to use really... the meaning is very vague.<br>it could mean...<br>1. an abnormal phenomenon/ usually a bad omen<br>2. ghosts/demons<br>3. something or someone evil/wicked<br>4. female sexuality/charm. Sometimes used to describe acting homo.<br>5. pervert/abnormal person<br>However.,,, those are the 'normal' meanings of the word. There's also the internet modern slang...<br>6. used to describe someone being so amazing that they surpassed everyone else<br>7. used to describe exceptional beauty (female)<br>There might be more that I do not know of.<br>However, it is clear that the term being used by bee is definition #6.<br>I had been translating it to demon-level character the entire time since the term genius was already taken. ]<br>&ldquo;I only just reached a breakthrough,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said to Chu Feng with a smile, &ldquo;Let me treat them with you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded. At that moment, Zhang Tianyi and his father were both seriously injured. Thus, Chu Feng did not have the time to care about the current situation, and decided to join hands with the Weaponry Refinement Immortal to heal Zhang Tianyi and his father&rsquo;s injuries on the spot.<br>After healing Zhang Tianyi and his father&rsquo;s injuries, Chu Feng said shamefully, &ldquo;Senior brother Zhang, senior Zhang, I have implicated the two of you again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My, what are you talking about? It is us who caused you to kill that Xian Yuyin&hellip; It seems that we have caused you enormous trouble,&rdquo; At that moment, Zhang Ming was extremely ashamed and guilty.<br>&ldquo;Junior brother Chu Feng, I am useless. I only know how to implicate you, and do not know how to help you with anything else,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi was also very ashamed.<br>The two of them both knew how powerful the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves were. The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves were the most frightening power in the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>Thus, the way they saw it, Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing of Xian Yuyin would definitely create enormous trouble for him. Furthermore, Chu Feng had done all of that because of them.<br>&ldquo;It might not necessarily be a misfortune,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal smiled lightly. He had said those words through voice transmission. As such, only Chu Feng, Zhang Tianyi and Zhang Ming heard it.<br>&ldquo;Mn?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Feng, Zhang Tianyi and Zhang Ming were all startled.<br>Zhang Tianyi and his father were confused by what the Weaponry Refinement Immortal meant. As for Chu Feng, he seemed to have realized something.<br>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; As the Weaponry Refinement Immortal Spoke, he planned to bring Chu Feng and the others away.<br>&ldquo;Demonic Genius Immortal!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Demonic Genius Immortal!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Demonic Genius Immortal!&rdquo;<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Right at that moment, thunderous shouting was heard from down below. Those shouting voices pierced through the skies and resonated through the heavenly dome.<br>It turned out that those bystanders had all caught up to them when Chu Feng and the Weaponry Refinement Immortal were treating Zhang Tianyi and Zhang Ming&rsquo;s injuries. At that moment, they were all shouting in celebration for Chu Feng.<br>They were celebrating Chu Feng&rsquo;s victory over Zhang Tianyi, and how he had obtained the title of the strongest member of the Holy Land of Martialism&rsquo;s younger generation.<br>Even though they had personally witnessed Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing of Xian Yuyin, no one blamed him. At the very least, the overwhelming majority supported Chu Feng&rsquo;s decision.<br>After all, the crowd all witnessed what had happened. How Xian Yuyin had treated Chu Feng&rsquo;s brother with torment. He was the one in the wrong first. For the sake of his brother, Chu Feng had killed Xian Yuyin. As such, he was not too excessive in his actions.<br>In fact, Chu Feng&rsquo;s decisiveness in killing Xian Yuyin caused a lot of people to feel respect for Chu Feng.<br>Only someone as loyal and affectionate to his family and friends like Chu Feng was worthy of their respect.<br>&ldquo;Demonic Genius Immortal?&rdquo; Chu Feng was startled and slightly confused.<br>Indeed, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal was present in this place. But, why would they be shouting &lsquo;Demonic Genius Immortal&rsquo; instead?<br>&ldquo;You still don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; At that moment, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal smiled.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You are a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. It is only natural for you to have the title of &lsquo;Immortal.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As you have not decided what to call yourself, others have decided for you. As such, many titles that others gave you began to spread through the Holy Land of Martialism.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And now, that Demonic Genius Immortal became a title that many people acknowledged. Thus, you are not only Chu Feng now, you are also the Demonic Genius Immortal,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Demonic Genius Immortal? My title?&rdquo; Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or to cry. Unknowingly, he was given a title by others. Furthermore, his title was the Demonic Genius Immortal.<br>By demonic, it meant that it was something different from normal, that it was a bad omen. It meant things like demons and ghosts. It meant people or things that were evil in nature.<br>By immortal, it meant a very capable person that upheld virtue and condemned evil. They were great scholars respected by others. &lsquo;Immortal&rsquo; meant people whom others should worship and aim to become.<br>The two parts of his title were completely incompatible with one another. They should not be placed together.<br>However, when using the term &lsquo;Demonic Genius Immortal&rsquo; to describe Chu Feng, it appeared to be extremely well-fitting.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng smiled. &ldquo;Very well. In that case, from today on, I shall be known as the Demonic Genius Immortal in the Holy Land of Martialism.&rdquo; He had acknowledged that title.<br>Afterwards, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, Chu Feng and the others stepped into the void. They continued to travel. It was only when they reached a place without anyone present that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, what happened this time around was caused by the Dark Hall.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So it was the Dark Hall,&rdquo; Chu Feng sighed. He had already suspected that this might be the case.<br>&ldquo;Dark Hall?&rdquo; Zhang Ming and Zhang Tianyi were confused.<br>Naturally, they knew of the Dark Hall. However, their knowledge was only limited to the Dark Hall&rsquo;s appearance at the Ximen Imperial Clan. They did not know anything else regarding the Dark Hall.<br>In fact, for the majority of the people in the Holy Land of Martialism, they only knew the Dark Hall from their appearance at the Ximen Imperial Clan, and did not know how dangerous the Dark Hall really was.<br>&ldquo;Senior brother Zhang, senior Zhang, the Dark Hall is extremely dangerous,&rdquo; Chu Feng roughly mentioned what had happened with the Dark Hall to Zhang Tianyi and Zhang Ming.<br>&ldquo;That Dark Hall is actually that powerful?&rdquo; After hearing about the Dark Hall, Zhang Tianyi and his father were both extremely shocked.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, they&rsquo;re extremely powerful. They were afraid of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; involvement in what&rsquo;s happening here, and actually launched attacks at many of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; powerhouses. In this sort of situation, the Elf King had no choice but to oversee the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves and direct the many Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves experts to fight against the Dark Hall.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master has shown himself repeatedly,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;The Dark Hall actually declared war on the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves? Furthermore, the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master has shown himself repeatedly?&rdquo; After hearing about what was happening, Zhang Ming was extremely shocked. After living in the Holy Land of Martialism for so long, he knew how powerful the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves were. Even after finding out that the Dark Hall was very dangerous, he did not believe that the Dark Hall would be capable of contending against the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves.<br>&ldquo;The Dark Hall will naturally not be a match for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves should they fight openly. However, the crucial aspect remains that they are in the shadows, while the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves are in the light. The Dark Hall has been repeatedly sending their elites to sneak attack the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; branches. As such, it is impossible for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves to completely contain the Dark Hall,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;Truly despicable,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, they&rsquo;re very despicable. However, the Dark Hall has underestimated the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you mean&hellip;?&rdquo; Chu Feng thought of something.<br>&ldquo;The Elf King fought against the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master once,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;What was the outcome of that battle?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master fled,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;His Majesty is truly amazing,&rdquo; After hearing that, Chu Feng was immediately overjoyed.<br>What the Dark Hall feared the most were the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves. Since the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master had fought against the Elf King, if he were able to kill the Elf King, he would&rsquo;ve definitely killed him.<br>However, he had instead escaped. This meant that he was still no match for the Elf King. This was a piece of good news, absolutely good news.<br>&ldquo;Not only that, even though the Dark Hall has tried their best to contain the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves have still dispatched a group of their elites here,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves actually sent a group of elites here at such a time?&rdquo; After hearing about this matter, Zhang Ming was even more shocked.<br>Logically, after being attacked repeatedly, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves should have dispatched experts from the Elf Kingdom to support their various branches.<br>After all, no matter what sort of conspiracy the Dark Hall might be planning here, they would be causing harm to others, and not the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves.<br>It was precisely because the people that would be harmed in this place were unrelated to the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves that Zhang Ming had a whole new level of respect for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves upon knowing that they had dispatched their elites here.<br>It turned out that the people who cared the most for the people of the Holy Land of Martialism were the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves.<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves thought of a possibility. If that possibility were to occur, it would be even more dreadful than what happened at the Blood Devouring Killing Formation. As such, they must prevent that from happening,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.<br>&ldquo;What is the Dark Hall planning now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Actually, it&rsquo;s better for Lord Luokong to explain this to you,&rdquo; The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said with a smile. Then, he continued to lead the way.<br>Lord Luokong?<br>Upon hearing that name, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart moved. He knew who Lord Luokong was. He was someone on par with Lord Lianghua, one of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; Elf Kingdom&rsquo;s Four Grand Elders.<br>Even though the Elf King was entangled with the Dark Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master and unable to personally come, the fact that Lord Luokong came caused Chu Feng to feel much more at ease.<br>After all, Lord Luokong was a Grand Elder. His strength would most likely not be inferior to Lord Lianghua&rsquo;s. Likely, he would also be a rank eight Martial Emperor. With him overseeing the situation, not to mention the Dark Hall&rsquo;s other experts, even the World Devastator Immortal would likely have to suffer consequences should he face him.<br><br></p></div>
