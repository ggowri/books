        <div> - From Enemy To Friend<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;You bunch of damned animals!&rdquo; Seeing that the people from the Dark Hall actually dared to mock them, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; experts all drew their weapons. They were planning to attack.<br>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Calm yourselves!&rdquo; At that moment, the Elf King stopped them with a deep shout.<br>Before Chu Feng's return, he could not be certain if any mishap had happened. However, he knew that Chu Feng was in their hands. In this sort of situation, he truly could not attack them willfully.<br>If the Icesnow Phoenixes truly did something to Chu Feng, battling with them would be fine.<br>However, if nothing happened to Chu Feng, yet they decided to fight it out on this side and kill the Icesnow Phoenixes, even if Chu Feng was fine now, he would definitely not be fine later.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha, come, attack. After all this time, and even after bringing all those stone monsters, turns out all you have is nothing more than false bravado,&rdquo; The people from the Dark hall continued to mock and laugh.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a figure suddenly descended from the air. When that person descended to the ground, the crowd discovered that it was the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;We pay our respects to Lord Clan Chief,&rdquo; When the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief appeared, all of the Icesnow Phoenixes bowed to greet him. It could be seen that this Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief possessed an extremely high status among the Icesnow Phoenixes.<br>Seeing that the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief returned with Chu Feng nowhere to be seen, the Elf King was unable to contain himself, and asked, &ldquo;Clan Chief Icesnow, where is Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>As for the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief, he did not immediately answer the Elf King. Instead, he retrieved the ring from the Rank 8 Martial Emperor Icesnow Phoenix holding it. After he put the ring on his finger, he pointed to the sky.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>The ring shone with a bright light. As the light enveloped the sky, the enormous Icesnow Phoenix turned into a ray of light and returned into the ring.<br>When that enormous Icesnow Phoenix disappeared, the bone-chilling sensation and overwhelming oppressive might also disappeared.<br>Then, the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief shouted to his clansmen, &ldquo;Make way.&rdquo;<br>Even though the Icesnow Phoenixes were confused as to their Clan Chief&rsquo;s intentions, they did not dare to speak against him. Thus, they immediately moved aside and revealed a wide path.<br>When even the Icesnow Phoenixes did not understand the intentions of their Clan Chief, the Elf King and the others would naturally be even more puzzled.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, little friend Chu Feng is currently waiting for you all in our Icesnow Phoenix clan. Right now, as the Icesnow Phoenix race&rsquo;s Clan Chief, I wish to invite you all as guests to our Icesnow Phoenix clan,&rdquo; The Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief said to the Elf King.<br>&ldquo;!!!!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the people from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; allied army were all startled.<br>What was going on? Weren&rsquo;t they extremely hostile toward one another earlier, to the point where they were going to fight a battle to the death? Why would he be inviting them to be guests now?<br>This change was too fast, no?!!!<br>Even though they were very surprised, it remained that the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief had retrieved that enormous Icesnow Phoenix, the only thing capable of being a threat to them. Thus, they were able to tell how sincere that Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief was.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for your trouble.&rdquo;<br>In response, the Elf King began to lead the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; army toward the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; territory.<br>&ldquo;Hey!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on with you all?! Lord Hall Master told you all to come here to stop them! Why are you letting them pass?!&rdquo; Seeing this scene, the people from the Dark Hall were all unable to contain themselves.<br>&ldquo;Icesnow Phoenixes, listen up,&rdquo; At that moment, the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief shouted again. He then turned his ice-cold gaze toward the people from the Dark Hall and ordered, &ldquo;Kill all of these people from the Dark Hall.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, not to mention the people from the Dark Hall, even the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves and the others were stunned. In fact, even the Icesnow Phoenixes themselves were stunned.<br>What was going on? Not only did they convert an enemy into a friend, they were actually going to kill the people from the Dark Hall, their former allies? This wouldn&rsquo;t be a joke, right?<br>Could it be that this was a conspiracy?<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves began to ponder.<br>&ldquo;Kill!!!!!!&rdquo;<br>Even though the Icesnow Phoenixes were extremely puzzled, they still complied with their Clan Chief&rsquo;s order.<br>One by one, they took out their weapons and began to massacre the people from the Dark Hall.<br>&ldquo;You unfaithful bas&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No!!!!&rdquo;<br>How could the people from the Dark Hall possibly be a match for the Icesnow Phoenixes? At that moment, other than screaming and crying for help, the only thing they could do was curse at the Icesnow Phoenixes.<br>However, none of that could change the reality before them. Before absolute power, the people from the Dark Hall and those Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts were soon massacred by the Icesnow Phoenixes.<br>In fact, not even a single intact corpse remained. The only thing that remained was blood frozen atop the ice glaciers.<br>&ldquo;Gulp.&rdquo;<br>After personally seeing the methods of the Icesnow Phoenixes, the experts from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; army involuntarily gulped down a mouthful of saliva.<br>As the saying goes, &lsquo;take what you hear to be false, only believe it when you see it&rsquo;. Just then, they had seen for themselves exactly how powerful and fierce the Icesnow Phoenixes were.<br>At that moment, they all felt traces of rejoice in their hearts.<br>They were glad that they had not waged war against the Icesnow Phoenixes earlier. Else, with the strength of the Icesnow Phoenixes, even if they were able to defeat them, they would definitely have suffered a disastrous amount of casualties.<br>&ldquo;Everyone, please.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief walked to the front of the crowd and began to personally lead the way for the Elf King and the others.<br>&ldquo;Your Majesty, this&hellip;&rdquo; Everything had happened too quickly. The crowd was still unable to react to it. Thus, they all looked to the Elf King.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo; At that moment, the Elf King smiled brilliantly. Then, he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely our little friend Chu Feng. He once again changed the battle situation by himself. He has once again helped us win another battle.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, the Icesnow Phoenixes will no longer be our great enemy. Likely, they will instead become our allies.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;.........&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the crowd all came to a sudden realization. Upon thinking about it, it was only Chu Feng who could create such an enormous change in such a short period of time.<br>After confirming that Chu Feng had reversed the battle situation and converted their great enemy, the Icesnow Phoenixes, into their allies, the crowd was pleased beyond expectation, and also endlessly astonished.<br>Just like that, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; army entered the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; territory.<br>Due to the fact that the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; territory was not very large, the army stationed themselves outside. However, the Icesnow Phoenixes treated them like important guests. They prepared top-notch food and wine for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; alliance army.<br>Neither the food nor the wine were ordinary. Instead, they were capable of replenishing one&rsquo;s spirit power and martial power. In fact, they were treasures capable of temporarily increasing one&rsquo;s battle power.<br>At the moment when the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; amy was being entertained, the top experts like the Elf King, the Four Grand Elders, the Eight Great Protectors, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and some others were invited into the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; territory.<br>In the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; territory was a vast plaza. All of the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; upper echelons were gathered in the plaza.<br>It seemed the Icesnow Phoenixes&rsquo; Clan Chief had an important announcement to make.<br><br></p></div>
