        <div> - Mocking Smile<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What is that Chu Feng trying to do?&rdquo;<br>Mengyan Miesha revealed a somewhat displeased gaze. He was slightly worried.<br>&ldquo;Regardless of what he might attempt, he won&rsquo;t be able to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light since our Linghu Heavenly Clan has determined it so,&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian said.<br>Hearing what Linghu Tiemian said, the expression of worry in Mengyan Miesha&rsquo;s eyes immediately disappeared.<br>Just as Mengyan Miesha had expected, Chu Feng was setting up a spirit formation with the intention of relying on that spirit formation to break through the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s blockade.<br>Furthermore, after putting forth the effort to set up the spirit formation, he was able to set it up successfully.<br>That spirit formation was a golden disk with a diameter measuring over a dozen meters. The disk was filled with runes and symbols. However, it did not appear to be very powerful.<br>However, after Chu Feng finished setting up that spirit formation, he had an extremely confident expression on his face.<br>&ldquo;People of the Linghu Heavenly Clan, listen carefully. Since I, Chu Feng, am able to summon the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, I, Chu Feng, will be able to enter it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo; After Chu Feng said those words, Linghu Tiemian burst into loud laughter.<br>&ldquo;Men! Go and notify Xiuming. Have Xiuming tell that Chu Feng that if he&rsquo;s able to successfully enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, I will allow him to train inside it,&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian said.<br>Once Linghu Tiemian gave that order, there were immediately people from the Linghu Heavenly clan that soared into the sky and began flying toward the direction of Linghu Xiuming.<br>Not long afterward, Linghu Xiuming&rsquo;s voice sounded from the New Excellence Formation again.<br>Linghu Xiuming said practically the same thing as Linghu Tiemian. He informed Chu Feng that if he was able to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, then Chu Feng and the others would be allowed to train inside the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>Hearing those words, hope was ignited in the eyes of the depressed newcomers.<br>A woman arrived beside Chu Feng and cautiously asked him with a requesting tone, &ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, are you&hellip; are you able to bring me into the Holy Spirit Formation of Light together with you?&rdquo;<br>Seeing that woman make such a request of Chu Feng, the other women also hurriedly gathered around him. In fact, it was not only the women. The men also revealed longing gazes as they looked to Chu Feng.<br>That said, even though the crowd were all longing to enter the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, very few among them asked Chu Feng to bring them with him. After all, unless one possessed extremely thick skin, it would truly be unsuitable for them to make such a request of Chu Feng. After all, they did not possess any friendship with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;As long as everyone is willing, I, Chu Feng, am willing to bring everyone into the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, the cultivation resources inside it belong to all of us,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to the crowd.<br>Once Chu Feng&rsquo;s words left his mouth, the crowd immediately burst into an uproar.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, I cannot thank you enough for your kindness. If you are able to bring us into the Holy Spirit Formation of Light today, I will listen to your every order inside this Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm. I will be ready to risk life and limb to help you out.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am the same.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Count me in too.&rdquo;<br>&hellip;...<br>At that moment, the crowd all began to declare their intentions to accompany Chu Feng into the Holy Spirit Formation of Light and follow Chu Feng afterwards. Their tones were filled with gratefulness.<br>After all, the crowd knew very well that the more people there were, the more difficult it would be to breach that lightning formation.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s willingness to bring them along was no different from putting more burdens upon himself.<br>Had it been someone else, they would definitely not be willing to do something like that. In fact, the crowd themselves knew that even they would not be willing to do so.<br>However, Chu Feng agreed to bring them along without the slightest hesitation. Furthermore, he did not make any demands of them either.<br>This naturally caused the crowd to feel grateful toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Do you all really think that he will be able to breach the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s grand formation using that formation of his?&rdquo; Right when the crowd was looking forward to entering the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, a voice akin to pouring cold water upon the crowd was heard.<br>It was Puyang Han.<br>&ldquo;How do you know that young master Chu Feng will not be able to breach that formation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could it be because you were unable to accomplish it that you feel young master Chu Feng will also not be able to do it?&rdquo;<br>Puyang Han&rsquo;s words were immediately met with criticism by many people.<br>At that moment, Puyang Han&rsquo;s expression turned ugly. The reason for that was because the ones that were criticizing him were practically all beautiful women.<br>If they were only ordinary women, Puyang Han would not react like that. The reason why Puyang Han was feeling so displeased was because among those women were some that were truly beautiful, so beautiful that even Puyang Han was tempted by their beauty.<br>In fact, earlier, Puyang Han was determined to swindle those women into his bedroom.<br>Whilst inside the New Excellence Formation, Puyang Han had attempted to get in contact with those women that he admired.<br>The great majority of the women were naturally unable to withstand the offense of a genius like Puyang Han, and had immediately expressed their favorable opinion of him.<br>However, there were actually a few of those women that were immune to his charm. Even with Puyang Han attempting to get close to them of his own initiative, they would still not warm up to him.<br>However, at that moment, both the women that held a favorable impression of him and the women that were unmoved by him were all running around Chu Feng, and were even criticizing him for Chu Feng.<br>This caused Puyang Han to feel extremely displeased.<br>&ldquo;Humph. Did you all think that spirit formation to be something that the Linghu Heavenly Clan set up?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let me tell you this; you all are mistaken. Although that spirit formation is related to the Linghu Heavenly Clan, it is not something that was set up by the Linghu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason why the Linghu Heavenly Clan is able to operate that spirit formation is because they have already gained control over the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s main formation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That main formation is capable of operating and controlling countless other formations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, what Chu Feng is up against is not only the Linghu Heavenly Clan. Instead, he&rsquo;ll be up against the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s main formation. Let me ask you all this: do you really think that Chu Feng will be able to defeat the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s main formation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If he truly possesses that sort of capability, why would he bother to enter the New Excellence Formation to train?&rdquo; Puyang Han mocked and ridiculed.<br>Once Puyang Han said those words, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions also changed. They felt what Puyang Han said to be very reasonable.<br>No matter how strong Chu Feng might be, it would be impossible for him to defeat the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s main formation.<br>At that moment, the crowd began to doubt Chu Feng&rsquo;s ability.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t that they didn&rsquo;t believe in Chu Feng. Rather, it was that they were all firmly certain as to how powerful the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm&rsquo;s main formation was.<br>Seeing the crowd look to Chu Feng with skeptical eyes, Puyang Han&rsquo;s displeasure disappeared, and an expression of complacence appeared on his face.<br>Feeling complacent, Puyang Han looked to Chu Feng. It was only then that he discovered that Chu Feng did not reveal the slightest trace of depression even though he was being looked on with skeptical gazes by the crowd. Furthermore, there was a smile on his face.<br>Most importantly, Puyang Han noticed that Chu Feng was looking at him. That mocking smile on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face was aimed at him.<br>Chu Feng&hellip; was actually mocking him?<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; what are you smiling about? Did you not hear what I said?&rdquo; Puyang Han asked in a very displeased manner.<br>&ldquo;If that main formation is truly as omnipotent as you described it to be, why didn&rsquo;t the Linghu Heavenly Clan summon the Holy Spirit Formation of Light directly? Why do they have to rely on us?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;How the hell would I know that?!!!&rdquo; Puyang Han didn&rsquo;t know how to answer Chu Feng&rsquo;s question, and thus could only argue with him.<br></p></div>
