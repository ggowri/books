        <h1>Chapter 5399</h1>
        <div><span>: The Duality of a Human</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>A cloud of dust rose tothe sky.</span><br><span>Two deep crevices appeared in the ground as the two black swords sliced down the two demonic beasts they had been pinning down, silencing their miserable cries. The beautiful woman had decided to kill them for daring to escape from her.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Anyone else wants to give it a try?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The beautiful woman coldly glanced at the other demonic beasts. Even though she looked nothing more than a speck of dust compared to the humongous demonic beasts, there was not one of them who dared to look her in the eye.</span><br><span>Without any hesitation, the remaining demonic beasts rushed into the cage as well.</span><br><span>The beautiful woman raised her hand and manifested a black tower, which swiftly expanded into an immense formation that enveloped the cage. The tower was transforming into the new Asura Demon Tower to imprison the demonic beasts once more.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;d like to know. Who in the world is that child?&rdquo; the Soul Devouring Demon Exalted asked.</span><br><span>The beautiful woman didn&rsquo;t answer that question, as if the Soul Devouring Demon Exalted was unqualified to speak to her.</span><br><span>Seeing that he was about to be sealed away once more, the Soul Devouring Demon Exalted shouted in agitation, &ldquo;Milord, you mustn&rsquo;t let that child go free. His demonic nature is so great that not even you will be able to control him! If he ever loses control of his demonic nature, it&rsquo;ll spell a calamity for all realms!&rdquo;</span><br><span>His voice continued to echo throughout the realm even after the Asura Demon Tower came to completion, almost as if to reflect his desperation. It was ironic how a Demon Exalted like him was offering such advice, but it also showed just how dangerous Chu Feng was.</span><br><span>Yet, the beautiful woman paid no attention to his advice. After sealing off the demonic beasts, she turned her gaze to Eggy. The coldness in her eyes melted to tenderness and sorrow.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord.&rdquo; The frost woman had finally arrived at the scene. &ldquo;How can a human like Chu Feng possess such an overwhelming demonic nature?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t a human possess such demonic nature?&rdquo; the beautiful woman asked.</span><br><span>The frost woman was unable to answer that question.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Humans are complex creatures. Compassion and evil are two sides of the same coin,&rdquo; the beautiful woman answered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;But Chu Feng&rsquo;s demonic nature is simply too terrifying. Even the Soul Devouring Demon Exalted was apprehensive of the danger he posed to the world. Milord, shouldn&rsquo;t we at least seal off his demonic nature?&rdquo; the frost woman asked.</span><br><span>Such overwhelming demonic nature could result in a catastrophe if it wasn&rsquo;t kept in check.</span><br><span>Instead of answering that question, the beautiful woman asked, &ldquo;Who do you think is more talented&mdash;Chu Feng or his mother?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to tell who is more talented, but I&rsquo;d say that Chu Feng has a much stronger foundation. His daoist heart is far stronger than anyone else I have seen at his age. It might not happen in the short term, but it&rsquo;s probably only a matter of time before he surpasses his mother,&rdquo; the frost woman said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Why do you think Chu Feng hasn&rsquo;t become a villain yet despite his overwhelming demonic nature?&rdquo; the beautiful woman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, you mentioned earlier that there are two sides to a human. Are you saying that Chu Feng&rsquo;s overwhelming demonic nature is being suppressed by his equally great compassion?&rdquo; the frost woman asked. &ldquo;But that only makes things even more dangerous. What if a day comes when his demonic nature overtakes his compassion? The consequences will be dire, especially with his talents!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng has encountered many injustices along the way. I don&rsquo;t deny that there are times when he disproportionately exacted vengeance on his enemies, but despite the difficulties he has been through, he continues to stand steadfast to principles. In my view, he is a good child who cares about the greater good.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Suppose that a day comes when his demonic nature overtakes his compassion, just how </span><span>much injustice must he have faced for him to trample over his own principles? I wouldn&rsquo;t want him to continue being a good person when that time comes,&rdquo; the beautiful woman said.</span><br><span>The frost woman fell silent.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You should know that it isn&rsquo;t wise to entrust a person too kind with heavy responsibilities. What we need right now are talents with Chu Feng if we wish to overcome the imminent calamity. The worst thing we can do now is to shackle him. You wouldn&rsquo;t have thought that he had such a frightening side to him if you didn&rsquo;t see his demonic nature, right?&rdquo; the beautiful woman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, I wouldn&rsquo;t have imagined it,&rdquo; the frost woman said.</span><br><span>She also knew about the duality of human nature, but she didn&rsquo;t think that a human could be this terrifying.</span><br><span>&ldquo;A person who has overwhelming demonic nature but equally great compassion as well. That&rsquo;s the kind of person we have been looking for. Let him grow freely. I dare say he&rsquo;ll stand with us when the calamity finally strikes,&rdquo; the beautiful woman said.</span><br><span>The frost woman lowered her head in shame for having doubted the judgment of the woman before her. She fell to her knees and kowtowed, saying, &ldquo;Please punish me for daring to doubt your judgment.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only normal for you to have doubts after witnessing Chu Feng&rsquo;s demonic nature,&rdquo; the beautiful woman replied with a gentle smile.</span><br><span>She then descended to Eggy&rsquo;s side and gently caressed the latter&rsquo;s face. Conflicting emotions could be seen in her eyes&mdash;tenderness, sympathy, doting, and guilt. She sighed softly before moving her hand over to Eggy&rsquo;s forehead.</span><br><span>She began infusing a powerful but gentle surge of asura power into Eggy&rsquo;s body, and the latter began to regain her cultivation. It only took a mere instant for Eggy&rsquo;s cultivation to return to its original level. At the same time, all of her injuries and traumas were healed too.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Milord, why don&rsquo;t you awaken her?&rdquo; the frost woman asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t time yet,&rdquo; the beautiful woman replied with reluctant eyes.</span><br><span>She stood up and turned her attention toward Chu Feng. She opened her palm, and a black sword rose from her hand. The black sword had a simple design, with hardly any carvings on it other than the word &lsquo;Asura&rsquo; on its blade. However, the materials and craftsmanship behind the sword were top-notch, such that it was no exaggeration to claim that it was a perfect sword.</span><br><span>Boom!</span><br><span>The entire world suddenly shook as a tempest raged. Even the Asura Demon Tower was trembling non-stop. The cause of this phenomenon was none other than the sword.</span><br><span>The sword harnessed such terrifying prowess that it compelled the submission of all beings.</span><br><span>The beautiful woman flicked her wrist, and the world finally reverted to normalcy. The </span><span>black sword began shrinking until it was only the size of a fingernail. The beautiful woman flicked her finger, and the black sword flew into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body through his heart.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng will sense the Asura Sword once he regains consciousness. Tell him that this is his reward for clearing the trial, though he&rsquo;ll have to figure out how to control the Asura Sword himself. Give him ten Life Crystals and tell him that you have used the other Life Crystals to treat his world spirit,&rdquo; the beautiful woman ordered.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; the frost woman replied.</span><br><span>The beautiful woman took one last glance at Eggy before taking her leave.</span><br><span>Once the beautiful woman was gone, the frost woman infused a sliver of her energy into Eggy&rsquo;s body with a snap, and the latter quickly regained consciousness. The first thing Eggy did was to look for Chu Feng.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Chu Feng!&rdquo;</span><br><span>Eggy rushed toward the unconscious Chu Feng to check his condition. She breathed a sigh of relief when she realized that he was only unconscious, but she still remained worried.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s fine. He has only overexerted himself. He&rsquo;ll wake up soon,&rdquo; the frost woman said as she secretly infused a sliver of her energy into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body too.</span><br><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyelids fluttered a few times before slowly opening his eyes.</span><br></p></div>
