        <div> - Rescue Failure<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, please tell me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a clasped fist.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that you would actually be this stubborn.&rdquo;<br>Seeing how determined Chu Feng was, Fumo Shaoyu could only sigh, and ultimately agreed to guide him.<br>But before that, he needed to rescue the people in the death prison.<br>The way he saw it, trying to rescue Little Fishy was a matter of near-certain death.<br>As such, he wanted to rescue the people here before proceeding to rescue her.<br>In the process, Chu Feng learned that Fumo Shaoyu had actually just recently gotten acquainted with Little Fishy.<br>They were also friends.<br>It was precisely because they were acquainted that Fumo Shaoyu was unable to watch as the people from the Netherworld Ice Hall arrested her so that they could refine her as a cultivation resource. That was why he'd attempted to rescue her.<br>Unfortunately, he'd ultimately failed in his rescue attempt. That was why he ended up being imprisoned in the death prison.<br>According to Fumo Shaoyu&rsquo;s understanding of the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master, if they were to fail in their rescue attempt this time around, they would likely not even receive the mercy of being imprisoned.<br>The Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master would directly refine them.<br>Originally, Chu Feng did not want Fumo Shaoyu to take the risk with him.<br>He only wanted Fumo Shaoyu to tell him where the main hall Little Fishy was imprisoned in was.<br>However, to his surprise, Fumo Shaoyu insisted on going with him. He even stated that he would not guide Chu Feng should he refuse his company.<br>However, Fumo Shaoyu wanted Fumo Xin&rsquo;er to leave.<br>He did not wish to involve her.<br>However, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er also insisted on following them.<br>With no choice, Chu Feng ultimately ended up journeying together with the siblings.<br>Fortunately, with Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formations, they managed to avoid the guards&rsquo; eyes, and enter the main hall smoothly.<br>Although the main hall was a truly dazzling sight, it was actually an enormous prison cell.<br>Merely, the people imprisoned there were comparatively important to the Netherworld Ice Hall.<br>That said, Little Fishy was the only person imprisoned in the main hall at that moment.<br>The instant they entered the main hall and saw Little Fishy, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heartbeat accelerated.<br>Little Fishy had her back facing them. She was lying inside a spirit formation.<br>As that spirit formation was transparent like a crystal, Chu Feng was able to clearly see Little Fishy.<br>Even though Little Fishy had her back facing them and Chu Feng could not see her appearance, her figure and posture were identical to the Little Fishy he knew.<br>In the blink of an eye, years had passed. Both Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength and appearance had changed quite a bit.<br>But, it seemed like time did not flow for Little Fishy.<br>There had been no change for Little Fishy at all.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng remembered a lot of things from the past.<br>Merely by seeing her back, Chu Feng began to reminisce about the past.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, you&rsquo;ve come?&rdquo;<br>Little Fishy sensed them, and turned around.<br>However, her gaze landed on Fumo Shaoyu instead.<br>She merely took a glance at Chu Feng before her gaze swept past him.<br>Instead, she was looking at Fumo Shaoyu with happiness and excitement.<br>At that moment, the excitement on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face disappeared immediately.<br>Their backs were so similar, practically identical even. Yet, the moment the little girl turned around, Chu Feng knew that the little girl was not the Little Fishy he knew.<br>He&hellip; had mistaken her.<br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not the one you knew?&rdquo;<br>A voice sounded. It was Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>Whilst Chu Feng was staring at the little girl, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er was staring at him.<br>From the change in his facial expressions, she knew that Chu Feng must&rsquo;ve mistaken Little Fishy for someone else.<br>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head. A look of disappointment was clearly present on his face.<br>Even though he had only interacted with Little Fishy for a short period of time, he'd truly wished to be able to see her again if at all possible.<br>He had thought that this wish of his would come true. Yet, it turned out to be for naught.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng felt that he might never be able to see the innocent little girl again.<br>Such was life...<br>For some people, they appeared very briefly in one&rsquo;s life, but were able to leave behind a great impression.<br>Little Fishy was one such special person in Chu Feng&rsquo;s life.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that little girl is extremely important to you,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er sighed. There was a trace of jealousy in her voice.<br>Chu Feng did not conceal anything, and nodded, &ldquo;She is very important.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er looked to Chu Feng with disgust. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t possibly be someone who likes little girls, right? It&rsquo;s no wonder you&rsquo;re not interested in me. So you&rsquo;re actually a pervert, a pedophile.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What are you talking about? I consider that girl as my younger sister, okay? She&rsquo;s still a child, how could I have feelings for her?&rdquo; Chu Feng immediately refuted. Black lines rolled down his head.<br>Meanwhile, Fumo Shaoyu was chatting passionately with the little girl.<br>Even though the little girl was not Little Fishy, she was also an innocent-looking little girl.<br>Even though she had been imprisoned and reduced to another&rsquo;s cultivation resource, there was no trace of worry on her face. She was acting like she was completely fine.<br>However, it was evident that the reason for that was because she didn&rsquo;t realize the danger she was in.<br>At that moment, the little girl was chatting amiably with Fumo Shaoyu.<br>The two of them had a very close relationship.<br>Their relationship resembled that of Little Fishy and Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, is Little Fishy not the Little Fishy you knew?&rdquo; Suddenly, Fumo Shaoyu, who was comforting Little Fishy, turned his gaze to look at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>&ldquo;In that case, brother Chu Feng, are you&hellip; still willing to save her?&rdquo; There was a pleading look in Fumo Shaoyu&rsquo;s eyes as he said those words.<br>Even though he didn&rsquo;t say it explicitly, he really hoped that Chu Feng would be willing to save the little girl.<br>&ldquo;It would seem that brother Shaoyu has not given up on rescuing her the entire time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Your earlier refusal must have been to deceive your little sister and I so that we would leave, and so that you could return on your own to rescue her, right?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>From Fumo Shaoyu's current attitude, Chu Feng could tell that the little girl was actually very important to him.<br>With how overflowing his emotions were, Chu Feng knew that Fumo Shaoyu wouldn&rsquo;t possibly refuse to rescue that little girl.<br>&ldquo;Originally, I had hoped for my grandma to come so that she could rescue her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, since my grandma didn&rsquo;t come, I don&rsquo;t wish to implicate others.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, my strength is limited. The spirit formation that Little Fishy is in is simply too difficult for me to breach.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If brother Chu Feng is willing to help, I, Fumo Shaoyu won't be able to thank you enough.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, as this place is simply too dangerous, and the Netherworld Ice Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master could show up at any moment, I will definitely not blame brother Chu Feng should brother Chu Feng not be willing to help me,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, I will save her.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was not someone to ignore another&rsquo;s pleas.<br>The reason he did not directly do anything to the spirit formation was because he'd been observing it, and looking for a way to breach it.<br>Chu Feng had found the method to breach the spirit formation, and thus he could immediately begin setting up his own spirit formation.<br>Merely, the spirit formation that imprisoned the little girl was extremely powerful. It was a spirit formation maintained with the power of an Ancient Era&rsquo;s treasure. Thus, even for Chu Feng, it would take time for him to breach it.<br>In the end, it took Chu Feng two entire hours to finish setting up a grand formation.<br>Furthermore, it took the grand formation four hours to breach the spirit formation trapping the little girl.<br>When the little girl walked out from the spirit formation, Chu Feng could see that both Fumo Shaoyu and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er were drenched in cold sweat.<br>In fact, even Chu Feng himself was drenched in cold sweat.<br>Six entire hours. The experts from the Netherworld Ice Hall could come in at any moment.<br>Furthermore, due to the special nature of the main hall, Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings would definitely be discovered should the people from the Netherworld Ice Hall come in.<br>Should that happen, it would most likely mean their deaths.<br>Being on edge for six entire hours was truly torture.<br>Fortunately, they succeeded.<br>Upon succeeding, Chu Feng and the Fumo siblings did not hesitate. They immediately brought the little girl and left the main hall.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right after they left the main hall, an enormous power descended from above.<br>That power covered the entire region and sealed off all directions. Like a rigid cage; it had trapped Chu Feng and others.<br>At the same time, a cold and gloomy voice exploded by Chu Feng and the others&rsquo; ears.<br>&ldquo;Audacious zealots, you dare steal my possession?! You all are truly courting death!&rdquo;<br>Hearing that voice, Chu Feng and the others all turned ashen.<br>They suddenly realized that they had fallen for a trap.<br>Whilst they had managed to successfully breach the spirit formation after six hours, they hadn&rsquo;t actually remained undetected.<br>They had evidently been discovered.<br>Merely&hellip; their foe had waited for them to come out before capturing them.<br></p></div>
