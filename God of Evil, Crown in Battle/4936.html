        <div>: The Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Legacy Ancient Formation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shengguang Baimei was a world spiritist too even though his proficiency was beneath that of Daoist Niantian. Even without Daoist Niantian&rsquo;s analysis, he was able to verify Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s words through the blueprint.<br>However, that didn&rsquo;t mean that he was going to let this matter rest just like that.<br>&ldquo;Despicable scum. How dare you use such a vile formation to harm Princess Miaomiao? Have you lost your conscience? You deserve to die!&rdquo;<br>Instead of releasing Master Yin Ren, Shengguang Baimei wanted to kill him. He thought that since they had acquired the formation to save Xian Miaomiao, there was no need to spare Master Yin Ren anymore.<br>After all, Master Yin Ren was one of the culprits who landed Xian Miaomiao in her current plight. He was the one who tore out Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s soul and put it into Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s body.<br>If not for Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s kindness, Xian Miaomiao would have already lost her life.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo;<br>Unexpectedly, Master Yin Ren remained composed despite Shengguang Baimei&rsquo;s killing intent. He even burst into laughter.<br>&ldquo;Milord, do you think that I have lost my value and intend to make use of this opportunity to get rid of me? If that&rsquo;s the case, you&rsquo;re really underestimating me. Your proficiency in world spiritist techniques is lacking, so why don&rsquo;t you let Daoist Niantian do the checking for you,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei realized that Master Yin Ren might have left a hand.<br>Master Yin Ren turned to Daoist Niantian and said, &ldquo;Brother Niantian, take a close look at the formation inside Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s body and tell me if it&rsquo;s possible for you to ensure Princess Miaomiao&rsquo;s safety if I were to lose my life.&rdquo;<br>Daoist Niantian grabbed Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s pulse and checked the formation inside her body.<br>Soon, he turned to Chu Feng with a frown.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another formation binding Princess Miaomiao&rsquo;s soul. It&rsquo;ll take some trouble to decipher it.&rdquo;<br>Daoist Niantian was saying that the only one who knew the way to decipher the formation was Master Yin Ren, so they couldn&rsquo;t kill him just yet.<br>&ldquo;How do we decipher the formation in Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s body? Spit it out!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei roared.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Master Yin Ren laughed.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s under the will of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief that I fused Princess Miaomiao&rsquo;s soul into Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s body. If you wish to insist that it&rsquo;s my fault despite knowing that, you can just take my life. However, I should let you know that I don&rsquo;t fear death.&rdquo;<br>Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s attitude made it clear that he wouldn&rsquo;t bow down to coercion.<br>&ldquo;Do you think that I dare not kill you?&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei asked with raised eyebrows.<br>It looked like he was going to make a move on Master Yin Ren.<br>However, Chu Feng suddenly interjected, &ldquo;Elder Baimei, you should retract your oppressive might from the time being.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, he can&rsquo;t condone his behavior. He&rsquo;ll just get smugger if we let him off this easily!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, all I wish for is Miaomiao&rsquo;s safety. Everything aside from that is negotiable,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He didn&rsquo;t have a pleasant first encounter with Shengguang Baimei, but the latter had done a lot for him since then. He didn&rsquo;t know whether the latter was helping him from the bottom of his heart or not, but he couldn&rsquo;t just shrug off what the latter had done for him.<br>As such, he chose to address Shengguang Baimei with a kinder and more courteous attitude.<br>&ldquo;You should thank young hero Chu Feng for his kindness.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Baimei shot Master Yin Ren a cold glare. He wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with this outcome, but he decided to respect Chu Feng&rsquo;s decision here and retract his oppressive might.<br>&ldquo;It looks like young friend Chu Feng is the more rational one here,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said with a smile. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, you aren&rsquo;t acquainted with any junior world spiritist who has reached rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t a problem. I&rsquo;m aware that young friend Chu Feng possesses outstanding skills as a world spiritist too, so I believe that you should be able to help Princess Miaomiao too,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said.<br>&ldquo;I was able to advance my spirit power when I acquired the stone, but even so, I&rsquo;m only at rank four Dragon Transformation Sensation at the moment. I&rsquo;m not confident of pulling it off,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied frankly.<br>Since Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s survival was at stake here, he didn&rsquo;t think that he should hide the extent of his capabilities. He wasn&rsquo;t willing to pull it off because he knew his own limitations.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s indeed insufficient to safely extract Princess Miaomiao&rsquo;s soul. You&rsquo;ll have to raise your spirit power to rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation. I happen to know of a way for you to swiftly increase your spirit power.<br>&ldquo;You should have no trouble reaching rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation if it works. If your intelligence is high enough, there&rsquo;s a chance that you might even reach rank seven Dragon Transformation Sensation in a single go,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s such a method?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was incredulous to hear those words.<br>&ldquo;There is, but it won&rsquo;t be easy to pull off. However, young friend Chu Feng, I think that you can give it a try,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said.<br>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, the method Master Yin Ren is speaking of is the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Legacy Ancient Formation, right?&rdquo; Daoist Niantian asked.<br>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren replied with a nod.<br>&ldquo;Elder Niantian, what&rsquo;s the Legacy Ancient Formation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked anxiously.<br>Daoist Niantian quickly explained the matter to Chu Feng.<br>The Zhuge Clan was the strongest world spiritist clan in the Nine Souls Galaxy. It had a long heritage, which allowed them to accrue many valuable treasures over the years.<br>Many years ago, the Zhuge Clan rescued a foreign world spiritist, but the latter had sustained overly severe injuries that eventually led to his death.<br>In his final moments, he constructed a huge legacy formation.<br>It was said that any talented junior world spiritist would be entitled to inherit his legacy.<br>The foreign world spiritist was quite a formidable individual. Even though the legacy formation was constructed in his last moments, the one who was qualified would still be able to obtain great benefits from it.<br>In fact, the foreign world spiritist had declared proudly that any talented junior world spiritist would be able to easily reach rank six Dragon Transformation Sensation upon obtaining his legacy. Those who were sufficiently intelligent could even reach rank seven.<br>Many prodigies had emerged from the Zhuge Clan since then, but not a single one had been able to obtain his legacy.<br>&ldquo;Are we heading to the Zhuge Clan then?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The Zhuge Clan has a long heritage. Many formidable world spiritist has appeared in their lineage. Even though they have weakened quite a bit over the years, the defensive formation left behind by their ancestors still poses quite a bit of trouble. Those beneath Half-God will find it hard to breach it.<br>&ldquo;On top of that, the Zhuge Clan values that legacy formation greatly. They won&rsquo;t allow an outsider to inherit the legacy. It won&rsquo;t be easy for you to get to it,&rdquo; Daoist Niantian said.<br>Chu Feng realized that this would be trickier than he had thought.<br>It would be impossible to negotiate with the Zhuge Clan over the use of the legacy formation, and they couldn&rsquo;t get to it forcefully either due to the defensive formation.<br>&ldquo;Actually, we can give it a try,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren suddenly spoke up.<br></p></div>
