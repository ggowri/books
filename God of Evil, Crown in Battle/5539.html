        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief didn&rsquo;t say a word, and the fear in his eyes disappeared in a flash. However, he retracted his domineering oppressive might.</span><br><span>That brought a smile to the face of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master, as he said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like it, Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. We have known each other for many years. Let&rsquo;s talk things out if there are any misunderstandings between us. Resorting to violence will only undermine the amicable ties between our clans.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master waved off his sleeves, and a palace instantaneously manifested around them. The palace was massive, but it only contained a set of a table and chairs positioned right in front of the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Take a seat, Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that. I hope that you can offer me a satisfactory explanation for what happened earlier,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, do you know who&rsquo;s the most talented prodigy of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion?&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it Ling Xiao?&rdquo;</span><br><span>It had already dawned on the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief that was unlikely to be the answer when he said those words, or else the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master wouldn&rsquo;t have asked such a question.</span><br><span>Still, with how talented Ling Xiao was, it was hard to imagine another junior more talented than him.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it.&rdquo; The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master shook his head. He looked at the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief with a proud expression. &ldquo;The most talented prodigy of our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion is Jie Tian.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Jie Tian? I have never heard of him before.&rdquo; The moment the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said those words, another possibility surfaced in his mind, and he quickly added, &ldquo;Have you been hiding him from the rest of the world?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Indeed, I have been raising </span><span>Tian&rsquo;er</span><span> right by my side. There are no more than ten </span><span>people in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion who know about </span><span>Tian&rsquo;er&rsquo;s</span><span> existence,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What does </span><span>Tian&rsquo;er</span><span> have to do with the events here? Could it be&hellip;&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief suddenly thought about the recent changes to the stone monument located in the Immemorial Star Sea. </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s</span><span> name had been clearly shown on it for a while, but her name suddenly began blurring and two words appeared on top of it.</span><br><span>Those two words were likely to be another person&rsquo;s name.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Could it be that Jie Tian has entered the Immemorial Star Sea too, and the second name appearing on the stone monument belongs to him?&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master replied with a nod. &ldquo;</span><span>Tian&rsquo;er</span><span> isn&rsquo;t just the most talented prodigy in our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. He&rsquo;s also </span><span>Mubai</span><span> and </span><span>Tiannian&rsquo;s</span><span> son, which makes him my grandson.&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was taken aback.</span><br><span>While he didn&rsquo;t expect to hear that Ling Xiao wasn&rsquo;t the most talented prodigy in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion, he wasn&rsquo;t too surprised since it wasn&rsquo;t out of character for the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master to pick out a prodigy and secretly nurture him.</span><br><span>However, the fact that Jie Tian was Jie </span><span>Mubai</span><span> and Jie </span><span>Tiannian&rsquo;s</span><span> son, as well as the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master&rsquo;s grandson, changed the nature of this matter.</span><br><span>The Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master had two daughters.</span><br><span>One was Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span>, who was known as the most talented individual to have ever emerged in the vast world of cultivation. The other was Jie </span><span>Tiannian</span><span>, who was a hundred years older than Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span>.</span><br><span>Prior to Jie </span><span>Ranqing&rsquo;s</span><span> rise to fame, Jie </span><span>Tiannian</span><span> and Jie </span><span>Mubai</span><span> had been the number one prodigy in the world of cultivation in their respective eras. In particular, Jie </span><span>Mubai</span><span> had been so talented that he didn&rsquo;t pale much in comparison to Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span>. He towered over all other prodigies who shared a generation with him, becoming an unsurpassable figure for them.</span><br><span>Jie </span><span>Mubai</span><span> was not at a thousand years of age yet, but he was close to reaching pinnacle True Dragon World Spiritist, which would make him the youngest powerhouse in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span><br><span>Whether he was truly the youngest powerhouse or not depended on how far Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span> had advanced her spirit power in her closed-door cultivation. It was hard to tell for sure, but most people reckoned that Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span> wouldn&rsquo;t pale much in comparison to Jie </span><span>Mubai</span><span>.</span><br><span>Regardless, there was no doubt that Jie </span><span>Mubai</span><span> was one of the strongest figures in the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion amongst the younger generation. Other than Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span>, he was the most likely person to become the next Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master.</span><br><span>Jie </span><span>Tiannian&rsquo;s</span><span> current strength was unknown, but her talent was only second to Jie </span><span>Mubai</span><span> and Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span> back then. It would be foolish to make light of her.</span><br><span>A child born between Jie </span><span>Mubai</span><span> and Jie </span><span>Tiannian</span><span> was not to be underestimated.</span><br><span>Speaking of which, the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had even attended Jie </span><span>Mubai</span><span> and Jie </span><span>Tiannian&rsquo;s</span><span> wedding decades ago. He clearly remembered the event, as it had happened shortly after Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span> announced that she would be going into closed-door cultivation.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who could have thought that </span><span>Mubai</span><span> and </span><span>Tiannian</span><span> already have a child?&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief remarked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Tian&rsquo;er</span><span> was born a year after their marriage. His birth was accompanied by a phenomenon, but I claimed that the phenomenon came from an ancient world spiritist remnant so as to not draw attention to him,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Could it be that phenomenon?&rdquo; The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was stunned.</span><br><span>He suddenly remembered a massive phenomenon spanning the entire Seven Realms Galaxy just a year after Jie </span><span>Mubai</span><span> and Jie </span><span>Tiannian&rsquo;s</span><span> marriage. It affected the entire world of cultivation; it was visible even from the Totem Galaxy.</span><br><span>However, the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master later announced that it was caused by the discovery of an ancient world spiritist remnant. Who could have thought that the true cause behind it was Jie Tian&rsquo;s birth?</span><br><span>&ldquo;That phenomenon was nowhere inferior to Jie </span><span>Ranqing&rsquo;s</span><span> birth,&rdquo; the Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Of course. </span><span>Tian&rsquo;er</span><span> has the Royal Bloodline too,&rdquo; the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master replied smugly.</span><br><span>&ldquo;He has the Royal Bloodline too?!&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was taken aback. The announcement heaped a great deal of stress on him. Jie </span><span>Ranqing</span><span> had shone brightly back in her generation because she had the Royal Bloodline, making her a unique existence in the world spiritist-filled Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.</span><br><span>Who could have thought that Jie </span><span>Mubai</span><span> and Jie </span><span>Tiannian&rsquo;s</span><span> child would possess the Royal Bloodline too?</span><br><span>All powerhouses knew how important the juniors were in God&rsquo;s Era. </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span> was already a headache to deal with, but who could have thought that the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion would have another possessor of the Royal Bloodline too?</span><br><span>Should this be true, Jie Tian&rsquo;s reputation would surely surpass that of Jie </span><span>Ranqing&rsquo;s</span><span>. The juniors of the current generation were different from the preceding ones; none of them were pushovers. Even Long Chengyu would have easily been the strongest junior if put in any other era.</span><br><span>There was no doubt that the strongest junior in the current generation would go down in history.</span><br><span>The Totem Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had an ominous feeling about this matter, but he couldn&rsquo;t be so petty as to show it. Instead, he burst into laughter and said, &ldquo;It looks like there&rsquo;ll be a rival for Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span>!&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span>?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The Seven Realm Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Mansion Master revealed a contemptuous smile, </span><span>almost as if saying that the current strongest and most talented prodigy of the world of cultivation, </span><span>Xianhai</span><span> </span><span>Shaoyu</span><span>, wasn&rsquo;t worth Jie Tian&rsquo;s attention at all.</span></p></div>
