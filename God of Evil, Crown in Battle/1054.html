        <div> - Three Kinds of Lightnings<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle?&rdquo; After hearing the words spoken by Sikong Zhaixing, the gaze Chu Feng looked to the boundless ocean of mist became even more focused.<br>It turned out the depths of this ocean of mist was a large sword-like enormous white needle. That thing was extremely big. It stretched forth from the ocean of mist all the way into the clouds above.<br>However, due to the fact that the distance was truly too far and the color of the enormous needle was not eye-catching at all, it made it simply impossible for ordinary people to see it. Even low rank Martial Kings were incapable of catching sight of it. However, Chu Feng was different. Chu Feng had trained in the Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes. Even if he did not use his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes, his ordinary eyesight still greatly surpassed that of ordinary Martial Kings.<br>&ldquo;The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle originated from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond. Legend has it that if someone is capable of reaching the deepest region of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond, they would end up triggering this Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle, causing it to give off a dazzling lightning that covers half of the entire plain. It would be a magnificent sight.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Moreover, it was said that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle would release different colors of lightning based on the race of the person who triggered it. For the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, it would be green. For monstrous beasts and other beasts, it would be red. If it was a human that triggered it, it would give off a golden color.&rdquo; Explained Sikong Zhaixing.<br>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that mean that although the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves are not human, they are also different from monstrous beasts?&rdquo; After hearing that the color that would be triggered by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves was different from humans and monstrous beasts, Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s of course. The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves is a special kind of race. Their appearance is more similar to that of humans. However, their nature is different from humans to a certain degree. Their lifespan is generally longer than humans. Moreover, it was said that their talent for martial cultivation also greatly surpassed that of ordinary humans. That is because they controlled the power of a special kind of bloodline.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In short, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves are extremely powerful beings. According to legend, a turmoil had occurred in the Ancient Era before. All of the races from that era were extinguished. For the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves to be able to continue to live on, this signified how powerful they are. Thus, it must be said that they are a great race, a race that deserves our reverence and respect,&rdquo; explained Sikong Zhaixing.<br>&ldquo;So it was like that. It would appear that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves are truly a race that stands out from the masses.&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded. He then asked, &ldquo;But, exactly how is this Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle triggered? Do people contend for the control of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle after entering the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond and the victor having the rights to trigger the lightning?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that simple. If one wished to release the lightning in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle, one must trigger the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle. As for triggering the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle, one must reach the deepest region of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond contains very dense natural energy as well as a special force. The deeper one proceeds, the stronger that force would become. However, not everyone is capable of withstanding that powerful force.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Moreover, that force does not test one&rsquo;s cultivation. Instead, it tests one&rsquo;s willpower, endurance, determination and talent for cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is the reason why not everyone could reach the deepest part of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond. As for those people that are capable of reaching the deepest part of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond, they are all extremely extraordinary.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was also because of this that everyone felt that being able to trigger the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle is an extremely honorable and glorious thing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, every year when the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds are opened, the goal of a portion of the people who entered it is not only to train and was instead triggering the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is because if any of them was able to trigger the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle, it signified that they are people who possessed exceptional talent. Not only would it bring about fame and honor for themselves, it would also bring about fame and honor to the entire human race.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, unfortunately, in the Cyanwood Region, in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond that is controlled by the Cyanwood Mountain, no one had ever managed to trigger its Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle. As for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds controlled by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, not a single human or monstrous beast has ever triggered the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle either. Every single time when the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle was triggered, it would always release a green colored lightning,&rdquo; explained Sikong Zhaixing.<br>&ldquo;It was also because of this that there are people that guessed that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle would only release green colored lightning and that the gold colored lightning when triggered by humans and red colored lightning when triggered by monstrous beasts were simply nonsense. After all, up until now, every time the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needles were triggered, the lightning released would always be green.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There are even people who believed that there is simply no such thing as triggering the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle. They believed that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle is simply not triggered by individuals but instead is a kind of uncontrollable natural phenomenon from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds,&rdquo; added the Cloud Thunder Pavilion&rsquo;s headmaster.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. If the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves possessed the power to trigger the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needles, then they would be able to cause the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needles to release green lightning every year. However, the puzzling matter is that every year the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves would enter the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds. However, for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needles in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds, they have not released any lightning for over a dozen years now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why people felt that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle being able to be triggered is simply phoney, a lie that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves created to display their might.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needles&rsquo; lightning is simply a natural phenomenon.&rdquo; Sikong Zhaixing also nodded. He did not reject this theory from the Cloud Thunder Pavilion&rsquo;s headmaster and instead actually voiced his approval.<br>&ldquo;No matter what, we&rsquo;ll know once we try it out for ourselves.&rdquo; Chu Feng did not take the speculation of Sikong Zhaixing and them to his heart. Instead, he gazed at the ancient and mysterious Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle in the distant and displayed a slight smile.<br>&ldquo;Junior brother Chu Feng, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly be thinking of entering the deepest part of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond to trigger that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Needle, right? I urge you to, by all means, not do such a thing.&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng&rsquo;s reaction was weird, Wang Wei secretly sent him a voice transmission to advise him against it.<br>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Chu Feng was confused.<br>&ldquo;Earlier, Lord Headmaster said that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond&rsquo;s deepest part contained very powerful energy. That energy is not something that ordinary people could withstand. If you&rsquo;re able to withstand it, then it wouldn&rsquo;t matter. But if you aren&rsquo;t able to do that, a light injury would be losing consciousness for several days whereas a serious injury would be exploding and dying on the spot.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Going to the deepest part of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond is an extremely dangerous thing. Every year, there are many outstanding disciples, both humans and monstrous beasts, that end losing their lives in the deepest part of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s also the reason why the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond has another name, the Graveyard of Geniuses,&rdquo; explained Wang Wei.<br>&ldquo;Graveyard of Geniuses? Are you implying that no one has successfully entered the deepest part of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond?&rdquo; Asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true either. There have indeed been people who have entered into the deepest part of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Pond and returned alive. However, it was evident that none of them have truly managed to reach the deepest part. Instead, they&rsquo;ve merely reached a place where they were able to withstand the energy, stopped and started training in the water.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves, they too would enter the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Immortal Ponds alongside us every year. Moreover, they would all be proceeding towards the deepest region. However, they are capable of returning safe and sound.&rdquo; Said Wang Wei.<br>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re able to do it, why is it that we are incapable?&rdquo; Hearing Wang Wei&rsquo;s response, Chu Feng smiled. His smile contained a trace of stubborness.<br></p></div>
