        <div> - The Furious Xia Yun&rsquo;er<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Cough, cough. Miss Xia, I didn&rsquo;t see anything. You don&rsquo;t have to be nervous.&rdquo;<br>Seeing Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s reaction, Chu Feng felt a bit embarrassed. Subconsciously, he lied and said he didn&rsquo;t see anything.<br>&ldquo;Even if you&rsquo;re lying, you should plan your lies properly. You said you didn&rsquo;t see anything, then what is with your body&rsquo;s reaction?&rdquo; Chu Lingxi pointed at Chu Feng&rsquo;s crotch.<br>It was only after hearing what Chu Lingxi said that Chu Feng noticed a certain region on his body was reacting like an awakened beast.<br>Perhaps that ferocious beast was too powerful. Even though Chu Feng was clearly wearing pants, the ferocious beast&rsquo;s might was still unable to be stopped. Even with his pants on, that awakened beast was still completely obvious.<br>As such, even Chu Lingxi had noticed the change that had occurred to Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>Chu Feng coughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s due to holding back my piss. You wouldn&rsquo;t understand, it&rsquo;s very difficult for men to hold back their urge to pee.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng laughed awkwardly as he adjusted his pants to make his awakened beast not so obvious.<br>Seeing Chu Feng reacting like this, Chu Lingxi covered her mouth and laughed.<br>Even though Chu Feng explained it in a deadpan manner, Chu Lingxi knew very well that Chu Feng&rsquo;s explanation was something that only fools would believe.<br>&ldquo;Bang~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a loud explosion sounded from below. Following that, a large wave of water surged forth violently from below.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze immediately turned serious. He was able to sense a very powerful killing intent from below.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I&rsquo;m going to kill you!&rdquo;<br>Following that, Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s furious shout was heard.<br>Soon, she reappeared before Chu Feng.<br>Not only was Xia Yun&rsquo;er fully clothed, but she was also holding two silver swords in her hands. Furthermore, a furious expression covered her face.<br>Seeing the current Xia Yun&rsquo;er, Chu Feng realized one thing: even beautiful women would appear to a bit frightening when their face was filled with anger and killing intent.<br>Most important of all would be Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s current aura.<br>Chu Feng clearly remembered that Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s cultivation had been that of a rank one True Immortal when he first met her.<br>However, the aura Xia Yun&rsquo;er was currently emitting was that of a rank four True Immortal.<br>&ldquo;This girl, could it be that she concealed her cultivation from the very start?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was very surprised. That said, he also became serious.<br>Thus, not only did Chu Feng immediately unleash his Divine-level Lightning Mark to increase his cultivation, but he also took out his Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s dual swords were being thrust forth repeatedly. Blade rays that blazed gold began to shoot toward Chu Feng.<br>It was not an ordinary attack. Rather, it was a Taboo Martial Skill.<br>That being said, Chu Feng was absolutely not one to be trifled with either. Chu Feng brandished his Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler repeatedly and blocked all the incoming blade rays.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>An ear-piercing sound was heard. Then, Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s dual swords were thrust toward Chu Feng.<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s speed was simply too fast. She had arrived before Chu Feng the moment he finished blocking her sword rays.<br>As Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s Incomplete Immortal Armaments were coming at Chu Feng head-on this time around, they were even more powerful.<br>As such, how could Chu Feng possibly dare to attempt to dodge the incoming attack? He immediately swung forth his Divine Dragon&rsquo;s Blood Ruler to block.<br>Sparks splattered about everywhere, and energy ripples surged forth. The water in the lake was overturned by the battle between the two.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng and Xia Yun&rsquo;er began to fight one another head-on using their respective Incomplete Immortal Armaments.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s ability in close-range fighting had always been extremely excellent among people of his generation. It could be said that he had never met his rival.<br>However, as he fought Xia Yun&rsquo;er, Chu Feng started to feel that he had met his rival.<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s swordplay was extremely sharp. Her swords were like two silver dragons that would become fierce and powerful from time to time.<br>It was as if those two swords were simply not Incomplete Immortal Armaments, but rather Xia Yun&rsquo;er herself. It was as if they had already fused with her. Her mastery over her weapons could simply be said to be perfection.<br>Fortunately, Chu Feng was not one to be trifled with either. Thus, no matter how sharp Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s attacks might be, regardless of how fatal they were, Chu Feng was still capable of blocking them.<br>&ldquo;Miss Xia, it&rsquo;s a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding,&rdquo; While blocking Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s attacks, Chu Feng tried to explain himself.<br>After all, at that moment, Chu Feng truly felt Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s killing intent. He knew that she was not joking around. That girl was truly planning to kill him.<br>However, what was the power behind Xia Yun&rsquo;er? It was the Starfall Holy Land, the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s huge monster, inferior to only the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Although Xia Yun&rsquo;er was a dangerous character, she and Chu Feng were not irreconcilable enemies.<br>Although Xia Yun&rsquo;er was the mastermind behind what had happened to Li Xiang, it remained that it was not her who had crippled Li Xiang&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>Chu Feng naturally wanted to avenge Li Xiang. However, he felt that it was not time yet. Furthermore, he did not feel that there was a need to kill Xia Yun&rsquo;er either.<br>At the very least, before Chu Feng could withstand the Starfall Holy Land, he could not become bitter enemies with Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>That was the reason why Chu Feng was trying so hard to explain himself.<br>&ldquo;Misunderstanding? Fine, dig out your own eyes, cut off your own tongue and then bring forth your life. Do that, and I&rsquo;ll believe that it&rsquo;s a misunderstanding,&rdquo; Even the tone with which Xia Yun&rsquo;er spoke had changed.<br>She was no longer hypocritical like before. The current her was the most dangerous, most unreasonable and most murderous. She had completely unleashed her fierceness and viciousness at that moment.<br>In other words, this was the actual Xia Yun&rsquo;er.<br>Thus, no matter what Chu Feng tried to say, it would be useless. The current Xia Yun&rsquo;er only had a single thought in mind: killing Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that. Miss Xia, aren&rsquo;t we friends? You were the one who said we were friends.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since you said that we&rsquo;re friends, how could you want to do all those things to me just because I happened to see you naked?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Moreover, it&rsquo;s not like I did it on purpose. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that you&rsquo;d taken off all your clothes, I wouldn&rsquo;t have seen you naked either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right, why did you take off all your clothes? Why can&rsquo;t you be like Chu Lingxi and stay inside the water properly? Why must you have a strange hobby of undressing after entering the water?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I will tear your mouth apart!&rdquo;<br>After hearing what Chu Feng said, Xia Yun&rsquo;er grew even more furious.<br>&ldquo;Huu, huu, huu~~~&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng noticed that cyan flames were actually being emitted from Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s body.<br>The cyan flames were wiggling and transforming. Like armor, the flames enveloped Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s body as they continued to burn.<br>Even though those were clearly flames, they showed no sign of dying out even though they were in water.<br>The flames were also not emitting heat. Instead, they were emitting a bone-chilling aura that filled the deep water with cold.<br>This was especially true when being in such close proximity to her. Chu Feng was able to feel with great certainty how cold those flames were.<br>Seeing this scene, Chu Feng immediately unleashed his trump card, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword.<br>Chu Feng had fought against Xia Yun&rsquo;er once before. Thus, he knew that this was Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s Divine Power.<br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er was extremely talented, and her Divine Power was also extremely powerful. It was not as simple as merely increasing one&rsquo;s battle power. Instead, her Divine Power was capable of increasing her cultivation by an entire level.<br>Sure enough, after the cyan flames appeared, Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s aura increased from rank four True Immortal to rank five True Immortal.<br>She thrust forth one of her swords. Its might was even stronger. Chu Feng was simply unable to block it.<br>Fortunately, Chu Feng had already unleashed his Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword, one of his trump cards.<br>Thus, before Xia Yun&rsquo;er&rsquo;s sword could reach Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, it was blocked by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Controlled by Chu Feng, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword started to shine brightly with golden light. Its light illuminated the deep dark water.<br>Then, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword also began to enlarge in size. It was growing larger and larger.<br>Under that sort of situation, Xia Yun&rsquo;er was forced further and further away from Chu Feng by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword.<br>&ldquo;Ahhh!!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Xia Yun&rsquo;er let out a scream.<br>Rather than calling it a scream, it would be more accurate to call it a furious shout.<br>&ldquo;Crap!&rdquo;<br>Seeing the current Xia Yun&rsquo;er, Chu Feng started to frown, and shouted, &lsquo;oh no&rsquo; in his heart.<br><br><br>Check out the June Giveaway for a chance to win $200, $100 or $50 Visa Gift Card<br><br></p></div>
