        <div> - Passing On By Force<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;The reason why Lord Duan Jidao was so enraged back then was because not only did the Duan Clan force the death of his lover, the corpse of his lover was actually unable to be found.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As such, Lord Duan Jidao suspected that the Duan Clan had destroyed his lover&rsquo;s corpse. That was why he was so enraged, and ended up massacring his entire clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Song Yuheng&rsquo;s grandfather had managed to find Lord Duan Jidao&rsquo;s lover&rsquo;s corpse. Although many years had passed, and she had already turned into bones, but her special long skirt was still the same as it was back then.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It was precisely because of that that Song Yuheng was thought so highly of by Lord Duan Jidao. When all's said and done, he was grateful toward Song Yuheng&rsquo;s grandfather,&rdquo; Yin Gongfu said.<br>&ldquo;No wonder Song Yuheng&rsquo;s father dares to speak to senior in such a manner. So he actually possesses backing. That said, Song Yuheng&rsquo;s grandfather knew about senior Duan&rsquo;s past?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t. in fact, it was quite a coincidence. His grandfather was a world spiritist who was fond of doing shady things like robbing tombs. Originally, Lord Duan Jidao was extremely disgusted with him. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the fact that Song Yuheng&rsquo;s talent was quite good, he would&rsquo;ve already driven him away.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, one day, Song Yuheng&rsquo;s grandfather actually brought back a corpse. He said that he felt that the clothes on that corpse were a treasure, and wanted Lord Duan Jidao to help inspect them for him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Originally, Lord Duan Jidao was extremely enraged by his actions. Not only was Song Yuheng&rsquo;s grandfather robbing tombs, he actually even wanted to make him an accomplice. As such, Lord Duan Jidao planned to severely punish him. However, when he saw the corpse, he discovered that it was actually his lover&rsquo;s corpse. At that moment, sadness and joy filled him simultaneously. It is said that Lord Duan Jidao actually began weeping bitter tears on the spot.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Afterwards, not only did Lord Duan Jidao not punish Song Yuheng&rsquo;s grandfather, he instead rewarded him and forcibly helped him reach rank one Martial Emperor from rank nine Half Martial Emperor. Right now, with Lord Duan&rsquo;s assistance, Song Yuheng&rsquo;s grandfather has become a rank two Martial Emperor, and is highly valued by Lord Duan Jidao,&rdquo; Yin Gongfu said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually such a coincidence in this world?&rdquo; Chu Feng gasped with admiration.<br>&ldquo;Yes, such a coincidence happened,&rdquo; Yin Gongfu felt helpless. He disliked coincidences like that very much. However, it had already happened.<br>&ldquo;Although senior Duan Jidao wanted to help find a successor for Emperor Huang, he was influenced by his emotions. If he is to truly pass on the strength of Emperor Huang to Song Yuheng, it would definitely not be a sensible act,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the case. If Lord Duan Jidao had decided to make Song Yuheng his successor, he would&rsquo;ve already passed Emperor Huang&rsquo;s power on to him. The reason why he still has not passed his power on is because he is still wishing to be able to find an appropriate candidate to pass the power on to.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, he has been incapable of finding a successor even now. While there are a lot of outstanding members of the younger generation from the Four Great Imperial Clans, Lord Duan will definitely not have a genius nurtured by the Four Great Imperial Clans as his successor,&rdquo; Yin Gongfu explained.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. If they have been abandoned by the Four Great Imperial Clans, it would be fine. However, if they were geniuses nurtured by the Four Great Imperial Clans, if senior Duan Jidao were to pass them Emperor Huang&rsquo;s strength, it would be equivalent to him helping the Four Great Imperial Clans increase their strength,&rdquo; Chu Feng naturally did not wish for the Four Great Imperial Clans to obtain Emperor Huang&rsquo;s power.<br>&ldquo;However, I&rsquo;ve found a suitable candidate now,&rdquo; Yin Gongfu looked to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please don&rsquo;t joke around. I am not someone who possesses an Imperial Bloodline. How could I receive the bloodline power?&rdquo; Chu Feng understood Yin Gongfu&rsquo;s intentions, and began to shake his head repeatedly. The reason for that was because he wanted Jiang Wushang to obtain Emperor Huang&rsquo;s power. He had never thought about obtaining Emperor Huang&rsquo;s power himself.<br>The reason why Chu Feng had not thought about that was because Chu Feng was able to determine that Emperor Huang&rsquo;s power was related to his Inherited Bloodline. Although his Inherited Bloodline might be stronger than ordinary Imperial Bloodlines, it should only be above Imperial Bloodlines.<br>However, his own Inherited Bloodline greatly surpassed Imperial Bloodlines. If he were to accept Emperor Huang&rsquo;s Bloodline, it might be possible for his cultivation to momentarily increase sharply. However, it might also be possible for his own Inherited Bloodline to become impure after mixing with Emperor Huang&rsquo;s Inherited Bloodline.<br>If that were to happen, it would affect his future cultivation progress. The gains would not make up for the losses.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, do you know why I&rsquo;ve told you about these things?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because, before I came to find you, I had already made the decision to recommend you to Lord Duan Jidao to have you become the successor of Emperor Huang,&rdquo; Yin Guangfu tried his best to persuade Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you absolutely must not do that. I absolutely cannot accept Emperor Huang&rsquo;s power,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, think it over carefully. If Song Yuheng is to really become the successor, your brother Jiang Wushang will most likely be killed by him. For his sake, you should accept that power,&rdquo; As Yin Gongfu spoke, he suddenly lifted his hand and pressed it onto Chu Feng&rsquo;s head.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng was startled. He felt that an enormous power was entering through his head and rushing through his entire body. Before that power, Chu Feng felt his entire body turning numb. He was actually unable to move at all.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, you also do not wish for the power of Lord Emperor Huang to end up in the hands of a vile character, right? For the sake of the people of the world, I can only wrong you,&rdquo; As Yin Gongfu spoke, his palm trembled. Immediately, Chu Feng felt his vision growing blurry. Then, he lost consciousness.<br>Afterward, Yin Gongfu carried Chu Feng on his shoulder and proceeded toward a hidden location in the World&rsquo;s Hidden Valley. This place was a forbidden area of the World&rsquo;s Hidden Valley. Only a few people were allowed to enter this place. As for Yin Gongfu, he was one of them.<br>This place resembled a wild, mountainous land. However, within that wild, mountainous land was a beautiful grave. On the gravestone were the words, &lsquo;Beloved Wife, Duan Qirou.&rsquo;<br>An old man was sitting cross-legged before this grave. He had dishevelled hair that made him resemble a beggar. Just like that, he sat motionlessly.<br>&ldquo;Lord Duan,&rdquo; Yin Gongfu placed Chu Feng onto the ground and then stepped forward to greet that man respectfully. It turned out that that man was the renowned Duan Jidao.<br>&ldquo;Who is it that you&rsquo;ve brought with you?&rdquo; Duan Jidao asked. However, he did not even bother to turn his head around to look.<br>&ldquo;Lord Duan, he is Chu Feng, that young man who has became a great enemy to the Four Great Imperial Clans recently,&rdquo; Yin Gongfu said.<br>&ldquo;Why did you bring him here?&rdquo; Duan Jidao asked.<br>&ldquo;Lord Duan, this child&rsquo;s talent is exceptional. He is no ordinary person. With a cultivation of rank eight Half Martial Emperor, he was able to defeat a rank one Martial Emperor. Furthermore, he is a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist,&rdquo; Yin Gongfu said.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Duan Jidao started to slowly stand up to carefully size Chu Feng up.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, he is a good sapling. Merely, why did you bring him here?&rdquo; Duan Jidao asked.<br>&ldquo;Milord, you have been feeling distressed this entire time because you have been unable to find a successor for Emperor Huang. I feel that Chu Feng is suitable,&rdquo; Yin Gongfu said.<br>&ldquo;Insolent! How could Emperor Huang&rsquo;s bloodline be so randomly passed on to others?!&rdquo; Duan Jidao shouted angrily.<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>Yin Gongfu kneeled on the ground and said, &ldquo;Milord, although I have only met Chu Feng today, I have been paying attention to his various accomplishments the entire time. I feel this child is an upright and honest man, a person who is loyal, and he possesses righteousness that is rare nowadays. Although he is wanted by the Four Great Imperial Clans, their accusations of him are all false.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Currently, the Four Great Imperial Clans want this child dead. Although he possesses extremely heaven-defying talent, it remains that he is still very small and weak. If you are able to pass on the power of Emperor Huang to him, it would be of assistance to him. I feel that if Emperor Huang&rsquo;s spirit was still alive in the heavens, he too would wish for his power to be passed on to this child.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although there is an abundant amount of geniuses in the Holy Land of Martialism right now, there is not a single person from the younger generation in the entire Holy Land of Martialism more qualified to receive Emperor Huang&rsquo;s power than Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;......&rdquo; After hearing what Yin Gongfu said, Duan Jidao, who was extremely angry, had managed to calm down a lot.<br>What Yin Gongfu had said was a stab to his sore spot. Out of gratefulness, he had planned to pass on Emperor Huang&rsquo;s power to Song Yuheng. However, he had not done so the entire time because he felt that he would be letting Emperor Huang down should he do so.<br>He naturally knew that Emperor Huang would want his power to be passed on to those with talent. Actually, back then, he himself had not been qualified to obtain Emperor Huang&rsquo;s power. The only reason why he had managed to obtain Emperor Huang&rsquo;s power was all due to luck.<br>Although he had obtained the power with luck, Duan Jidao made a firm resolution when he obtained Emperor Huang&rsquo;s power that after he gained strength, he would find the most outstanding member of the younger generation in the Holy Land of Martialism to succeed Emperor Huang&rsquo;s power so that Emperor Huang would be able to rest in peace. However, things had turned out contrary to the way he had wished.<br>Upon thinking of that, Duan Jidao began to survey Chu Feng once again. The more he observed Chu Feng, the brighter his eyes shone. Chu Feng&rsquo;s each and every aspect surpassed his imagination.<br>Such a Chu Feng was simply even more excellent that the candidate that he had in mind. Duan Jidao felt that even if Emperor Huang, Huangfu Shou, were still alive, he would also definitely pass his power on to Chu Feng after seeing him.<br></p></div>
