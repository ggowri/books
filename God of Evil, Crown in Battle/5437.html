        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><br><span>Chu Feng was sitting weakly on the ground with a pale face. Somehow, the paintings containing the sealing formation carried a hint of Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura.</span><br><span>The World Spiritist Painter immediately understood what had happened. As unbelievable as it might seem, the person who had kept the enemy from breaching the seal was actually not him but Chu Feng.</span><br><span>However, he was in no mood to pay any attention to Chu Feng. He quickly made his way toward the gate, and horror filled his eyes when he noticed the small crack in it. Without any hesitation, he took out a painting and plastered it on the crack.</span><br><span>The painting morphed into a formation that repaired the crack.</span><br><span>Even so, the World Spiritist Painter was still worried. He checked the gate multiple times before finally turning his attention toward Chu Feng. &ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, did you really take control of the sealing formations here to ward off the black aura?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I did, but it looks like I have overestimated myself,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a feeble smile. Talking seemed to be too much for his current condition, and he spurted a mouthful of blood right after.</span><br><span>The sealing formation was too powerful. Chu Feng had to pay a heavy price to control it for a short period of time.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Eat this pill first.&rdquo; The World Spiritist Painter passed a pill over to Chu Feng.</span><br><span>Chu Feng quickly did as he was told, and his complexion slowly improved.</span><br><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Purple Dragon God-cloak World Spiritist. I don&rsquo;t know how you controlled that sealing formation, but it&rsquo;s a miracle that you&rsquo;re still alive after doing so,&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter said in amazement.</span><br><span>Even attempting to take control of the sealing formation should have resulted in a fatal backlash for someone of Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power, but Chu Feng actually managed to pull it off and even survive the backlash. This was unbelievable.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, I was able to use my spirit power for a brief moment earlier, but then it was </span><span>quickly sealed off right after,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>After sustaining the backlash from controlling the sealing formations, he had wanted to take out his pills to recuperate from his injuries, only to find that his Cosmos Sack and his powers had been sealed off once again. Thinking about it, it was only when the black aura had invaded the palace that he regained his powers, so he added, &ldquo;Is it related to the black aura?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes. Those who enter the All Lives Are Equal Palace will have their powers sealed unless I have bestowed you with the exemption formation. The black aura earlier disrupted the balance of this land, thus allowing you to temporarily regain your sealed powers,&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, what was that earlier black aura? Why was it able to disrupt the balance of this land?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a secret, young friend Chu Feng,&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span><br><span>However, the World Spiritist Painter suddenly changed his tune and said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do me a favor, young friend Chu Feng? In return, I&rsquo;ll make an exemption and fill you in on the details.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Feel free to ask anything of me, elder,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I would like you to help me decipher the formation inside this painting. Help me check what is inside this painting,&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter said as he took out a painting.</span><br><span>It was a scenery painting, but Chu Feng could tell that it was anything but normal right away. After a quick glance, his eyes became fixated to a certain position on the painting.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you able to see it?&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter anxiously asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, are you referring to the All Lives Are Equal Palace inside the painting?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Are you really able to see it? I have finally found the right person!&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter exclaimed in delight.</span><br><span>Normal people shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to see the All Lives Are Equal Palace in the painting. Even the World Spiritist Painter himself had to spend many years before he could finally see it&mdash;it had started out blurred for him before it slowly became distinct.</span><br><span>Yet, Chu Feng could tell it was the All Lives Are Equal Palace right away. This showed the gap between the two of them.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is the palace entrance opened?&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What is inside there?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;A corridor. A very long corridor.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;A very long corridor? What else do you see aside from the corridor?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything else, but it seems like there is something deep inside the corridor.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng stared at the painting more intently than ever. A few moments later, he answered, &ldquo;A coffin.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;A coffin?&rdquo; The World Spiritist Painter was stunned.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Yes, a coffin.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Who is inside the coffin?&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>Despite his negative answer, Chu Feng continued staring at the painting to decipher its </span><span>content. Knowing that he might need some time to make out the details, the World Spiritist Painter nervously waited by the side.</span><br><span>In the end, Chu Feng shook his head and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s all I can see. It looks like I&rsquo;m unable to see through the formation inside the painting too.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Calm down, young friend. I spent thirty thousand years deciphering this painting, but it only took you moments to see what I failed to see. I believe that you&rsquo;ll decipher the formation in due time,&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, while my spirit power might be much weaker than you at the moment, I am certain that I won&rsquo;t be able to decipher the painting no matter how far my spirit power advances in the future. The coffin is the limit of what I can see,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>The World Spiritist Painter was disappointed to hear those words.</span><br><span>&ldquo;My apologies. As much as I want to help you, my capabilities are limited,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; The World Spiritist Painter shook his head before carefully stowing away the painting. &ldquo;Young friend, the owner of the All Lives Are Equal Palace is a great world spiritist in the Ancient Era who goes by the name of Chaotic Era Scholar. He was the one who created the method to imprint a formation into a painting. All of my capabilities were inherited from him.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng was overjoyed to hear that. While he had failed to help the World Spiritist Painter, the latter had nonetheless decided to tell him about the history of this place.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Scholar has left behind many records. One of them contained a detailed description of this gate.&rdquo; The World Spiritist Painter gestured toward the gate where the malevolent being was sealed.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Sealed within this gate is an object out of the grievances of the deceased. This object initially existed with no will and no form, but over time, it gradually became tangible and even gained its own will. Lord Scholar had collected it to turn it into a painting, but he could not complete it for various reasons. Lord Scholar was reluctant to destroy this object as it had taken him a lot of effort to collect it, so he eventually decided to seal it off. He even left behind the method to control it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Lord Scholar had expressed his wish for someone to inherit his legacy and use the object to create an unparalleled artwork in his will, but at the same time, he had warned us to not attempt to remove the seal if no such person has appeared yet. While this object will gradually dissipate after being freed from the seal, it&rsquo;ll cause great destruction before then</span><br><span>&ldquo;I discovered this All Lives Are Equal Palace together with a good friend, but there was later a conflict between us, and we eventually parted ways. However, that good friend of mine took the method to control the object away with him,&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Is your friend the person behind the black aura?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;My friend is a man, whereas the culprit behind the black aura was a woman. It could be possible that my friend has told others about this matter or that woman is his descendant. In any case, I am grateful to young friend Chu Feng for your help. If not for you, the woman might have succeeded in freeing the object. That would have spelled our deaths,&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Will that person return again?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Definitely. That&rsquo;s why we have to proceed carefully,&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;If that person knows that the object will dissipate in due time, what reason does she have </span><span>to unseal it? Does she have a personal vendetta against you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;The object will go on a killing spree, but it is unable to destroy the All Lives Are Equal Palace. My guess is that the culprit wishes to kill me using the object so that she can take possession of the All Lives Are Equal Palace,&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Elder, do you have any countermeasures?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; the World Spiritist Painter replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good to hear.&rdquo; Chu Feng breathed a sigh of relief. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one more matter I&rsquo;d like to ask about.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Feel free to speak your mind.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Chu Feng walked up to one of the paintings and pointed at it. &ldquo;Elder, do you know this person?&rdquo;</span><br><span>The painting was none other than the one left behind by Qing Xuantian.</span><br></p></div>
