        <div> - Learning an Immortal Technique<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;It is unknown what sort of method he used to enter the Void Sacred Tree. However, it remains that he has managed to enter it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, there are people that feel that that person is not someone from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Instead, they feel that he is some sort of spiritual organism related to the Void Sacred Tree, and that must be the reason why he has appeared in the Void Sacred Tree. However, regardless of what it is, everyone wants to chat with him, as we might be able to obtain some sort of harvest from it,&rdquo; Ma Changchun said.<br>&ldquo;Spiritual organism? That is possible indeed. However, does this spiritual organism have any distinctive characteristics?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;There is nothing special regarding its body, as its physical appearance is no different from humans. Merely, its clothing is extremely peculiar,&rdquo; Ma Changchun said.<br>&ldquo;What is particular regarding its clothing?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;He had the appearance of a man. Furthermore, judging from his appearance, he is not very old, and seemed to be a member of the younger generation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, his physical appearance and outfit are simply too weird. Reportedly, that man does not have a lot of hair. However, each and every one of them is perked up. To put it simply, his hairstyle resembles that of a hedgehog.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;His eyes are not very large. Yet, they are whirling about nonstop. He is simply shifty-eyed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;His nose resembles a garlic. As for his mouth, it is very unimpressive; it is actually crooked.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, the strangest of all must be his outfit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;His upper body is completely naked. He is as thin as a match. With skin and bones, there is no muscle to be seen. It is as if he has not eaten in a very long time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for his lower body, there is only a large pair of underpants.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Reportedly, the underlying color of his underpants is green, and over the green underpants are gorgeous flowers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is precisely because of those flowery underpants that people feel that he is a spiritual substance born from the Void Sacred Tree.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, there are all kinds of flowers on his underpants. Those flowers include peonies, roses, plum blossoms, osmanthus, peach blossoms and all kinds of other flowers.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right. After he sees people, he will ask them where this place is. Furthermore, he will even stutter when he speaks,&rdquo; Ma Changchun said.<br>&lsquo;Holy crap!&rsquo; Upon hearing till this point, Chu Feng felt as if countless enormous waves were surging in his heart.<br>This description, is it not Wang Qiang?<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s Wang Qiang. Wang Qiang is inside the Void Sacred Tree?&rdquo; Her Lady Queen was also very surprised. Yet, she was also feeling very excited at the same time.<br>Like Chu Feng, Her Lady Queen was practically certain that it was Wang Qiang.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, this is quite remarkable. The vortexes that you all encountered on the Stairway to Heaven seem to be far superior to what you imagined,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said excitedly.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, it's extremely strange,&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart was wavering nonstop.<br>After entering the Sacred Mountain World, Chu Feng had originally thought that Wang Qiang and the others had also arrived in the Sacred Mountain World.<br>He had thought that they&rsquo;d entered through different entrances, and were placed at different locations because of that.<br>However, judging from how things were now, it seemed that it was not as simple as Chu Feng had thought.<br>At the very least, Wang Qiang did not enter the Sacred Mountain World at all. Instead, he had entered the Void Sacred Tree.<br>Most coincidentally, both the Sacred Mountain and the Sacred Tree were part of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s Six Great Sacred Vestiges.<br>&ldquo;Senior, is that person the only person that has been seen in the Void Sacred Tree?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Chu Feng asked this because he wanted to know if Zhao Hong, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi were together with Wang Qiang.<br>Or could it be that because Zhao Hong, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi had entered different vortexes, they were in different places.<br>&ldquo;Reportedly, that man is the only person there.&rdquo; Ma Changchun said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you think that Zhao Hong and the others have entered the other Divine Vestiges?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, the so-called Six Great Divine Vestiges possess a thread connecting them,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;That is possible. However, it's hard to determine if that&rsquo;s the case. Regardless, I must proceed to the Void Sacred Tree and meet with Wang Qiang as soon as possible,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I wonder if he has a way to let you enter the Void Sacred Tree too. If you can enter it, you will definitely be able to train faster in there. It might even be possible for you to contend against those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations by the next Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>It would be a lie for Chu Feng to say that he didn&rsquo;t want to do that.<br>However, what Chu Feng was more worried about now was not whether or not he could enter the Void Sacred Tree to train.<br>Rather, he wanted to know what sort of information he could gather from Wang Qiang. What he hoped for the most would be for Wang Qiang, Zhao Hong, Ying Mingchao and Zi Xunyi to all be fine.<br>&ldquo;Senior, where is the Void Sacred Tree located?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;The Void Sacred Tree is located in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s Evenly Rising Province. Little friend Chu Feng, if you wish to go there, how about you journey together with us? We just so happen to be on our way there too,&rdquo; Elder Ma Changchun said.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;Haha, great. It is our honor to be able to travel together with little friend Chu Feng,&rdquo; Seeing that Chu Feng had agreed to travel with them, Ma Changchun was very happy.<br>&ldquo;This is great, we&rsquo;ll be able to journey to the Void Sacred Tree together with big brother Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;By then, the news of big brother Chu Feng defeating Han Yu should&rsquo;ve spread. I am truly looking forward to the people of the younger generation looking at my big brother Chu Feng with gazes of admiration.&rdquo;<br>Li Xiang and the others were also extremely happy. Perhaps they were affected by Li Xiang, but even though all of the Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s disciples present were older than Chu Feng, they were all addressing Chu Feng as big brother.<br>Chu Feng did not dislike this, as he felt that the great majority of their enthusiasm was sincere.<br>That said, those that were enthusiastic toward Chu Feng were most definitely not only limited to the Sacred Pellet Villa&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>However, apart from Ma Changchun and several other elders, the great majority of the elders present only gave Chu Feng the feeling of being eagerly attentive.<br>They were not necessarily fond of Chu Feng from the bottom of their hearts. They were only smiling at Chu Feng because they did not wish to offend him.<br>As it was Elder Ma Changchun leading the crowd as they traveled, Chu Feng and the others did not have to spend any effort at all. They were able to travel with Ma Changchun&rsquo;s martial power. As such, Chu Feng had a lot of free time.<br>After chatting for some time, Chu Feng gave the excuse of training, closed his eyes and sat down.<br>That said, Chu Feng was indeed training. However, he was not trying to gain martial comprehension. Instead, he was planning to learn an Immortal Technique.<br>When Chu Feng helped save Song Xi, he had withstood a portion of Song Xi&rsquo;s inheritance.<br>From that inheritance, Chu Feng gained three Immortal Techniques.<br>Rank one Immortal Technique: Aura Poison Flow.<br>Rank two Immortal Technique: Monstrous Poison Flow.<br>Rank three Immortal Technique: Dragon Poison Flow.<br><br><br></p></div>
