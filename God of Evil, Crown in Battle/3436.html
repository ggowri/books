        <h1>Chapter 3435</h1>
        <div> - Father&rsquo;s Friend<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng finally heaved a sigh of relief after the Xu Heavenly Clansmen left. However, he did not dare to be careless, as his cultivation had been sealed. Thus, he did not know if the Xu Heavenly Clansmen had hidden themselves, or had really left.<br>Thus, since he had decided to put on a performance, Chu Feng was determined to continue with it.<br>As such, after the Xu Heavenly Clansmen left, Chu Feng did not show any trace of joy. He reacted as if everything was within his expectations, as if it were natural that the Xu Heavenly Clansmen had left.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, thanks a lot.&rdquo;<br>That Chu Heavenly Clansman said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you are being too courteous. We are of the same clan, what I&rsquo;ve done is merely what I should&rsquo;ve done. Besides, it was those Xu Heavenly Clansmen that were bullying you intolerably,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Even though that&rsquo;s the case, it remains that I am someone who grew up together with Xuanyuan. It should&rsquo;ve been me who was protecting you. Yet now, you ended up being the one to protect me. I am truly ashamed,&rdquo; That man sighed, and revealed an ashamed expression.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s emotions were stirred. He was pleasantly surprised. Immediately, he asked, &ldquo;Senior, you know my father?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;More than know,&rdquo; The man suddenly sighed again.<br>Then, after asking the man, Chu Feng learned that his name was Chu Chengkong.<br>Although Chu Chengkong possessed a very low status in the Chu Heavenly Clan right now, he was a very close friend of Chu Xuanyuan. It was not a lie when he said that he had grown up with him.<br>Merely, as Chu Xuanyuan grew up too fast and faced too many challenges, Chu Chengkong gradually started having fewer and fewer interactions with Chu Xuanyuan.<br>Even though their difference in status and the difference in their daily affairs caused their distance to increase, Chu Xuanyuan had always recognized Chu Chengkong as his friend.<br>Later on, Chu Xuanyuan even offered to help Chu Chengkong increase his cultivation.<br>Merely, he was refused by Chu Chengkong.<br>Chu Feng naturally wanted to know the reason for Chu Chengkong&rsquo;s refusal.<br>After being asked about it, Chu Chengkong ended up telling him his reason.<br>Chu Chengkong felt that cultivating was something that one should rely on oneself for. Regardless of how strong one could become, one would not have any regret should one rely on oneself the entire time.<br>&ldquo;This guy is truly capable of spouting nonsense. How could he say that sort of thing? How could there be anyone that would be willing to refuse the opportunity to increase one&rsquo;s cultivation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Never have I heard that Chu Xuanyuan had such a friend.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The way I see it, he&rsquo;s a nameless nobody. He is trying to worm his way in to Chu Feng&rsquo;s friendship. That&rsquo;s why he blabbered such nonsense.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s the case too.&rdquo;<br>However, after hearing Chu Chengkong&rsquo;s words, the bystanders all started to discuss him spiritedly.<br>There were even people that began to loudly shout to Chu Feng, telling him to not believe Chu Chengkong&rsquo;s lies.<br>Hearing the crowd&rsquo;s discussion, Chu Chengkong seemed to also be afraid that Chu Feng might be overthinking things. Thus, he said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Chu Feng, I am not telling you this because I want to worm my way into being close to you. Actually&hellip; I already met you when you returned to our clan. I personally witnessed you ascending to the top of the Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I had wanted to worm my way into a relationship with you, I could have sought you out that day.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am telling you all this today because I wanted to let you know that I am not lying to you. I indeed knew your father for many years, and grew up with him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you do not believe me, you can go and ask Lord Chu Xuanzhengfa. He also knows about this,&rdquo; Chu Chengkong said to Chu Feng with a very serious expression and worry in his eyes. He was afraid that Chu Feng would not believe him, afraid that Chu Feng would think that he was trying to deceive him.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I believe all of your words.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, you didn&rsquo;t tell me all of that of your own accord. Instead, you only told me about it after I asked you.&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Chu Feng was not trying to comfort Chu Chengkong. Rather, he really believed him.<br>Although Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power was currently sealed, which made it so that he could not observe others through the use of his world spirit techniques, Chu Feng had seen countless people throughout the years. As such, he possessed some capability to judge people&rsquo;s character. Whilst he did not dare to say that his judgement would be absolutely accurate, he had some confidence in it.<br>The way Chu Feng saw it, Chu Chengkong was a simple and honest man.<br>He was likely someone who did not have any ambitions, a nobody. Generally speaking, people like that had a decent conscience.<br>Whilst he might be cowardly, weak and suffer from the same sort of ailments as other nobodies, Chu Chengkong had a firm belief, something pure from the bottom of his heart.<br>Chu Chengkong definitely longed for power. However, he did not wish to rely on others to gain power. That was why he had refused Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s assistance.<br>Whilst Chu Chengkong was afraid of dangers, he was also someone who would stand up to protect the people that he treasured. That was why he stood forth to shield Chu Feng behind him even though he was deeply frightened by the Xu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if others believe me or not. It is already sufficient that you believe me,&rdquo; Hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, Chu Chengkong revealed a smile.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a burst of wind blew forth. Several figures flew over and landed behind Chu Feng.<br>Following that, a very emotional voice sounded, &ldquo;Young friend, are you really Chu Feng of the Chu Heavenly Clan, the son of Chu Xuanyuan?&rdquo;<br></p></div>
