        <h1>Chapter 3106</h1>
        <div> - Netherworld Royal Clan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to panic about?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are we unable to survive just because Chu Feng has left?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though Chu Feng has left, there&rsquo;s still me and Wushang. All of you, move back. No matter what sort of thing that monster might be, I will be able to eradicate it,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi spoke loudly.<br>&ldquo;You, eradicate it? What makes you think you&rsquo;re capable of that? Even your cultivation was granted by it. How could you possibly eradicate it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Everyone, don&rsquo;t listen to his boastings. Quickly, run away! Take advantage of the fact that the monster has yet to appear and flee from this place!&rdquo;<br>Once someone called out for the people to flee, the panicky crowd were immediately awakened. Like a flock of startled birds, the crowd began to soar into the sky and flee in all directions.<br>&ldquo;A bunch of fools. All of you shall become this King&rsquo;s food. Not a single one of you shall escape!&rdquo;<br>However, at the moment when the crowd was fleeing, a frightening and mocking voice sounded from within the volcano.<br>When that voice was heard, a boundless aura was also emitted from the volcano. In an instant, that aura covered the surrounding heaven and earth. Apart from Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang, everyone else present had their movement restricted.<br>The reason for that was because that aura was that of a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor.<br>&ldquo;Doomed, we&rsquo;re doomed!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd were truly frightened. Even though they were all martial cultivators that had trained for many years, there were actually people among them that started to wail in fear.<br>They all felt that they were toast. After all, they were unable to even flee, and could only wait for death.<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Zhang Tianyi burst into loud laughter.<br>His sudden laughter puzzled the crowd.<br>Even though a great calamity was upon them, how could Zhang Tianyi not be panicked, but instead laugh? Could it be that he had gone insane from the fear?<br>&ldquo;And here I was wondering how powerful you might be. It turns out, you&rsquo;re merely a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You want to take care of us with your mere rank nine Half Martial Ancestor cultivation? You are simply indulging in fantasy,&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi spoke loudly.<br>&ldquo;What? Rank nine Half Martial Ancestor? That monster is only a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In that case, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that we&rsquo;re saved?&rdquo;<br>Hearing what Zhang Tianyi said, the crowd finally realized why Zhang Tianyi was laughing and rejoicing.<br>After all, they already knew that both Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang were rank nine Half Martial Ancestors.<br>If that monster was truly only a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor, then Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang would have great odds in being able to defeat that monster two-on-one.<br>&ldquo;Tsk, tsk, tsk, truly foolish.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a figure flew out from the volcano. The monster had finally revealed itself.<br>&ldquo;Do you really think that you are capable of contending against this King?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Have you forgotten who granted you your current power?&rdquo; The monster said to Zhang Tianyi.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; Zhang Tianyi asked.<br>&ldquo;Tsk, tsk, sure enough, you&rsquo;re a fool. Since you are unable to comprehend words, I will use actions to tell you.&rdquo;<br>After the monster finished saying those words, the fur-like hair on that monster&rsquo;s body started to tremble violently. Following that, a strange power began to pulse from its body.<br>&ldquo;Eaaahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>Everyone present, including Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang, all started to scream miserably.<br>All the people that had flown into the sky suddenly fell to the ground.<br>At that moment, the tens of millions of people that had covered the region were all grabbing their heads with their hands and rolling about on the ground whilst screaming miserably.<br>Even Zhang Tianyi and Jiang Wushang, the two rank nine Half Martial Ancestors, were no exception.<br>The reason for that was because their power was all being stripped away.<br>That monster was absorbing their cultivations. It was retrieving the cultivation that it had bestowed upon them.<br>&ldquo;Alas, not only are you all foolish, but you are also useless.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This King released so much of my power, yet you all only managed to make such minute progress in your cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You have all truly disappointed this King. I must punish you all. You shall suffer greater pain. Otherwise, you will not be able to alleviate the anger of this King.&rdquo;<br>After it finished saying those words, the monster began to accelerate the speed at which its fur-like hair wiggled. Zhang Tianyi and the others began to scream even more miserably. At the same time, their cultivations were being absorbed even faster.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, another scream was heard.<br>After that scream was heard, the crowd that was originally screaming in pain stopped.<br>The reason for that was because they were shocked to discover that the enormous unbearable pain that they were feeling had disappeared.<br>At the same time, the power within their bodies also stopped leaving them.<br>Everyone was confused. They did not understand why the monster would suddenly ease their torment.<br>&ldquo;Who are you?! You dare ruin this King&rsquo;s happy occasion?!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, that monster&rsquo;s voice was heard again.<br>The crowd looked toward the direction of the monster&rsquo;s voice, and were immediately overjoyed.<br>They discovered that the monster was actually lying on the ground. On top of that monster&rsquo;s head stood a person.<br>That person was Chu Feng.<br>It turned out that it wasn&rsquo;t that the monster had stopped its torture. Instead, it was that Chu Feng had saved them.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it&rsquo;s Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re saved, we&rsquo;re saved!&rdquo;<br>Seeing Chu Feng, the crowd reacted as if they&rsquo;d seen their savior.<br>They were even more overjoyed when they discovered that monster was actually completely powerless to fight back against Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;This king?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hah, you dare to proclaim yourself to be a king with your mere bits of strength?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the monster.<br>&ldquo;Humph, we of the Netherworld Royal Clan are all kings. We are destined to enslave all you living creatures!&rdquo; That monster said.<br>&ldquo;Netherworld Royal Clan?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Feng narrowed his brows. Then, he asked, &ldquo;Where did you come from? How did you arrive at this place?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Where did I come from? Haha. Why must this King inform a puny little creature like you of that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Puny little being, you will never know where this King is from.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This King shall forever become the fear in your heart.&rdquo;<br>After it finished saying those words, the monster&rsquo;s body started to squirm. Then, with a bang, the monster exploded.<br>The power of that monster&rsquo;s self-detonation was extremely strong. It had surpassed the cultivation of the monster itself. Chu Feng felt that monster&rsquo;s self-detonation was as powerful as a True Immortal&rsquo;s attack.<br>That sort of power was enough to massacre everyone present in an instant, leaving not even a speck behind.<br>However, with Chu Feng there, it would not be able to harm anyone.<br>With a thought, Chu Feng suppressed the power of the self-detonation.<br>After suppressing that power, Chu Feng extended his hand toward the distant sky and made a grabbing motion. Immediately, boundless suction power emerged from Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand. Following that, a crimson body of light appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>It was the monster from before. Merely, that monster was now not only much smaller, but also appeared like a spirit body.<br>That monster was struggling violently and letting out ear-piercing roars and boundless oppressive might nonstop.<br></p></div>
