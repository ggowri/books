        <div> - Overestimating One&rsquo;s Capabilities?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After examining the world he found himself in, Chu Feng confirmed that there were a lot of treasures hidden in the World Spirit Mansion Gate. However, he was unable to determine exactly what sort of treasures they were.<br>That said, he was able to confirm that there was more than a single treasure that was enticing to him. There were at least two or more.<br>One of them was rather hidden. It was hidden deep within the World Spirit Mansion Gate.<br>As it was extremely hidden, Chu Feng was unable to determine its location. He would need to search for it carefully.<br>As for the other one, it was rather nearby. Furthermore, it was giving off a rather stable aura.<br>If Chu Feng wanted to find it, it would be extremely easy to do so.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng confirmed his goal. He planned to find the treasure with a stable aura that was in rather close proximity to him. Then, he would penetrate deeply into the World Spirit Mansion Gate to seek out the hidden difficult-to-find treasure.<br>Chu Feng journeyed onward. Soon, he arrived at the location of that stable treasure.<br>That place was a circular plaza.<br>The plaza was enormous. Chu Feng was also able to see that there were over ten thousand gates located deep within the plaza.<br>Each and every gate differed from the other.<br>Some were copper, some were iron, and others were wooden. However&hellip; they were all composed of world spirit techniques.<br>Furthermore, besides the materials, the design and the appearance of the gates were also completely different.<br>That said, Chu Feng was able to tell with a single glance that all of the gates contained profound mysteries.<br>Furthermore, the gates all provided the answer as to what was behind them.<br>Merely, only those who were meticulous would be able to notice the answers.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s focus was not mainly placed on the gates.<br>There were simply too many gates. If he wanted to examine them properly, he would need some time.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze was focused on the plaza.<br>At the entrance to the plaza stood an enormous stone stele.<br>Red characters were present on the stele. Those characters were very large and eye-catching.<br>&lsquo;There are treasures in the pillars. The treasures are protected by spirit formation. Assess your own capabilities and act accordingly. Do not be greedy. Otherwise&hellip; you shall have to bear the consequences.&rsquo;<br>That was evidently a warning.<br>Sure enough, multiple stone pillars stood at the center of the plaza.<br>Chu Feng roughly estimated that there were over ten thousand stone pillars. Standing erect in the plaza, they were like a forest of stones.<br>That said, the thickness and size of the stone pillars were all different.<br>Furthermore, it was as the stele had said. All of the stone pillars each contained a treasure.<br>However, every stone pillar had a spirit formation that guarded its treasure. If one wanted to obtain the treasure within a stone pillar, one must first breach the spirit formation.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze landed on the stone pillar located at the center of the plaza.<br>That stone pillar was the largest and thickest in the entire plaza.<br>Even if all of the other stone pillars were added together, that stone pillar would still be slightly larger.<br>It was the only stone pillar that pierced through the clouds, and resembled something that could reach the heavens.<br>It resembled a giant mountain overlooking countless little earthen hills as it stood there.<br>Its existence made all the other stone pillars appear extremely insignificant and small.<br>The stable aura of the treasure that Chu Feng had felt earlier came from within that stone pillar.<br>&ldquo;That stone pillar&rsquo;s spirit formation seems to be quite difficult to breach. Don&rsquo;t be careless.&rdquo;<br>A voice sounded in Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears. That voice came from his world spirit space.<br>It was Yu Sha&rsquo;s voice.<br>&ldquo;Yoh? Girl, you actually know how to show concern for others?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile.<br>However, he was ignored by Yu Sha.<br>&ldquo;Truly a cold and detached girl.&rdquo; Chu Feng felt helpless.<br>After Chu Feng confirmed his target, he did not hesitate. He walked over to the stone pillar and began to place various items around it.<br>Those items were capable of assisting Chu Feng in breaching the stone pillar&rsquo;s protective formation sooner.<br>&ldquo;What is that guy doing?&rdquo;<br>Many people were gathered in the plaza.<br>Some of them were wholeheartedly focused on breaching the protective formation of a stone pillar. Others were preparing to make their attempt. As for the others, they were still meticulously choosing their stone pillars.<br>That said, many people were captivated by Chu Feng&rsquo;s movements.<br>&ldquo;The items that guy&rsquo;s putting down all contain spirit power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t possibly be thinking of challenging that first-tier stone pillar&rsquo;s spirit formation, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Heavens! He seems to be planning to do just that!&rdquo;<br>At the beginning, the crowd only looked at Chu Feng out of curiosity. However, they soon confirmed that he was really going to challenge that stone pillar&rsquo;s spirit formation.<br>With that, the crowd burst into an uproar.<br>They were all world spiritists. Furthermore, the majority of them were people that had entered the World Spirit Mansion Gate multiple times.<br>Thus, they could be said to possess considerable knowledge of the World Spirit Mansion Gate.<br>Every stone pillar in this plaza contained a treasure beneficial to world spiritists or world spirits. The crowd had no idea what the treasures were. However, without a doubt, the larger the stone pillar was, the better the treasure inside it.<br>Through the sizes of the stone pillars, the crowd divided them into ten different tiers.<br>The great majority of people were challenging tenth-tier stone pillars.<br>Those with some ability would go and challenge the ninth-tier stone pillars.<br>Only the top geniuses would challenge eighth-tier stone pillars.<br>As for seventh-tier stone pillars, they would occasionally be challenged. However, very rarely did anyone succeed.<br>As for the sixth-tier stone pillars, simply no one would challenge them.<br>The reason why no one challenged them was because the spirit formations they possessed were simply too powerful.<br>In the past, someone had challenged a sixth-tier stone pillar, and had ended up being directly engulfed and killed by its spirit formation.<br>Thus, sixth-tier stone pillars were seen to be taboos by the crowd.<br>As for the fifth-tier stone pillars, simply no one had ever challenged them.<br>As for the spirit formation Chu Feng needed to breach, it belonged to the one and only first-tier stone pillar.<br>The crowd was filled with reverence for the first-tier stone pillar. Simply no one dared to approach it, much less think about challenging it.<br>That was also the reason why Chu Feng immediately caught the crowd&rsquo;s attention after he approached the stone pillar.<br>Chu Feng had done something that they did not dare to attempt.<br>That said, never did the crowd imagine that Chu Feng would actually think about breaching the first-tier stone pillar&rsquo;s spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Hey! Do you have a deathwish?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You should stop immediately!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Bastard, quickly leave that place! That is the first-tier stone pillar; if you challenge it, you won&rsquo;t even know how you died!&rdquo;<br>Many people were shouting at Chu Feng, urging him to stop immediately.<br>&ldquo;Thank you all for your kind intentions. However, I am able to handle it.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng knew that those people were shouting at him with kind intentions. Thus, he smiled at them.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng had finished laying out his items. After he said those words, he sat down cross-legged and began to prepare to set up his spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;Handle my ass! Scram immediately! You fool! Don&rsquo;t overestimate your capabilities! No one gives a damn if you decide to court your death, but if you are to cause us to die too, I your daddy will kill you first!&rdquo;<br>Surprisingly, right after Chu Feng sat down, a profanity-filled voice sounded from behind him.<br></p></div>
