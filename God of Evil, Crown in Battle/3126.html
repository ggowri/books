        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Ambition<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Chu Ping ended up following Chu Feng and the others, he did not do so with the intention of finding the so-called undercurrent of the Immortal River.<br>He wanted to persuade Chu Feng to not have his emotions affect his decisions. He was still trying to have Chu Feng reconcile with Chu Hongyi.<br>Even while Chu Feng and the others were descending, Chu Ping was still trying to persuade Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That is?&rdquo;<br>However, when Chu Ping decided to try to persuade Chu Feng again after landing, he opened his mouth and was unable to close it.<br>An incomparable amount of astonishment filled his eyes.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had released his spirit power.<br>Chu Ping was no fool. He was able to tell from a single glance that Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit power was not Immortal level, but rather Exalted level.<br>Even though it was only Insect Mark, it remained that Chu Feng was an actual Exalted-cloak World Spiritist.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; little sister Shuangshuang, this&hellip; this&hellip; this&hellip;?&rdquo; Overwhelmed with shock, Chu Ping looked to Chu Shuangshuang.<br>It was only at that moment that Chu Ping realized why Chu Shuangshuang and the others trusted Chu Feng this much.<br>It turned out that it was not because they had a close relationship with him. Instead, it was because they knew that Chu Feng was truly capable of finding the legendary undercurrent of the Immortal River.<br>&ldquo;Big brother Chu Ping, do you believe what I said now?&rdquo; Chu Shuangshuang said to Chu Ping with a smile on her face.<br>At the same time, Chu Qing also looked to Chu Ping with a smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;Little sister Shuangshaung, little brothers, since you all already knew that little brother Chu Feng is an Insect Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist, why didn&rsquo;t you mention it earlier?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you all had mentioned it earlier, how could everyone not believe in little brother Chu Feng?&rdquo; Chu Ping&rsquo;s words contained a bit of a reproaching tone.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Shuangshuang opened her mouth with the intention to explain. However, before she could speak, Chu Qing spoke, &ldquo;Big brother Chu Ping, those people did not believe in little brother Chu Feng, and even insulted him. What reason is there for little brother Chu Feng to prove to them that he&rsquo;s an Insect Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason is that we are a family,&rdquo; Chu Ping said.<br>&ldquo;Mn, indeed, we are a family. But just because we&rsquo;re family, does it mean that we can start insulting and mocking another without figuring out what is right or wrong?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng was thinking of everyone&rsquo;s good when he said that he could bring everyone to this undercurrent of the Immortal River.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But not only did they not appreciate his kindness, they even started to look at little brother Chu Feng with mocking and ridiculing gazes.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is this what it means to be family? The way I see it, they&rsquo;re more like vile individuals who seek nothing but personal profit,&rdquo; Chu Qing said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Qing, I understand your opinion, merely&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Ping still wanted to provide further explanation.<br>&ldquo;Merely people are not all virtuous sages. Little brother Chu Feng does not have the responsibility or the obligation to take care of those so-called clansmen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is just like how no one bothered to sympathize when little brother Chu Feng was exiled to the Lower Realms, and when uncle Chu Xuanyuan was imprisoned in the forbidden area,&rdquo; Chu Qing interrupted.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Ping&rsquo;s face grew stiff, and he spoke no more. Instead, he revealed a slightly ashamed expression.<br>&ldquo;Big brother was wrong. I should not have made such an unreasonable request of you all,&rdquo; Chu Ping sighed. His tone was filled with remorse.<br>He suddenly realized that whilst Chu Feng had extraordinary talent, he had gone through great difficulties to journey all the way here from a Lower Realm.<br>It was true, the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan did not have any qualifications to ask Chu Feng to do anything for them. As for Chu Ping, he had even less qualifications.<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly asked Chu Ping, &ldquo;Big brother Chu Ping, do you know why I did not prove myself to them?&rdquo;<br>Hearing such a question from Chu Feng, Chu Ping&rsquo;s expression also changed. He hesitated. However, in the end, he still asked, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if I were to let them know that I am an Insect Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist, they would still not necessarily believe me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because this undercurrent of the Immortal River is very hard to find. Even though I am an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist, those people would still think that I will definitely be able to discover it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With how rare of an opportunity the appearance of the Immortal Rivers are, I believe everyone would seek stability, and not take risks,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. One must be at least an Insect Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist in order to find an undercurrent of the Immortal River. However, that is the bare minimum requirement. That does not mean that one will definitely be able to find an undercurrent of the Immortal River should one be an Insect Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist. After all, the undercurrents of Immortal Rivers are separated into many different types.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So it turns out that little brother Chu Feng did not wish for everyone to take risks. I have wrongly blamed you earlier,&rdquo; Chu Ping said.<br>&ldquo;It is their decision as to whether or not to believe me. However, that was not the reason why I did not reveal my strength,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Ping&rsquo;s expression changed. He asked, &ldquo;Little brother Chu Feng, exactly what might the reason be then?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, I merely wished to teach them a lesson, and make them realize that it will only be their loss to not believe in me, Chu Feng. Only by doing that would I be able to properly lead them in the future,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>Hearing those words, not to mention Chu Ping, even the expressions of Chu Shuangshuang and the others turned stiff with shock.<br>None of them had expected Chu Feng to reveal his inner thoughts so openly.<br>They understood what Chu Feng meant by those words. He was planning to lead the Chu Heavenly Clansmen in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br>The reason why they were so shocked was because of how nonchalantly Chu Feng said those words, how he revealed his ambitions in such a soft-pedaled manner.<br>This in turn revealed how confident Chu Feng was.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the Immortal River signs in the sky started to disappear. The starry rivers in the sky dissipated, and were replaced with a vast blue sky, white clouds and warm sunshine.<br>At that moment, the region looked very ordinary.<br>It was as if they had returned from a dreamland.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, the earth started to tremble violently. It seemed like there was some sort of violent movement deep underground.<br>At the same time, the grand formation that Chu Feng had set up began to go through an enormous change. The spirit power within the grand formation began to surge violently, forming different sorts of runes and patterns.<br>The crowd present all knew that Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation was showing signs of something. Merely, they were unable to understand what it was showing.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and the grand formation before him vanished into thin air.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s action baffled Chu Ping and the others. Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation was clearly reacting to something. Why would Chu Feng cancel it without even bothering to look at it?<br>However, at the moment when the crowd was confused, Chu Feng said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found where the undercurrent of the Immortal River is. Everyone, follow me.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he began to move. He was diving deep underground.<br>Seeing that, Chu Ping and the others immediately followed him.<br>Originally, Chu Ping was filled with doubts.<br>After all, it was a very difficult task even for Insect Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritists to find an undercurrent of the Immortal River.<br>As such, how could Chu Feng discover the location of the undercurrent of the Immortal River so quickly and effortlessly?<br>However, as he followed Chu Feng deep underground, Chu Ping was able to sense a boundless stream of natural energies from all directions.<br>At that moment, Chu Ping&rsquo;s heart exploded with excitement.<br>His hairs were standing on end, and he was even shivering.<br>The reason for that was because he knew that it was the aura of an undercurrent of the Immortal River.<br>At that moment, Chu Ping looked to Chu Feng again. His gaze had changed completely.<br>As he looked at Chu Feng&rsquo;s back, he had a sort of feeling in his heart.<br>Perhaps this junior that had just arrived in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm would bring disruption to the peace in the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.<br></p></div>
