        <div> - Who Sealed It?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Strongest?&rdquo; The gaze of the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted changed slightly.<br>Many people spoke of wanting to become the strongest. However, the majority of them were merely boasting or delusional.<br>However, when Chu Feng said those words, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted felt that he was being serious.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a fool of myself before senior,&rdquo; Chu Feng felt that his words were a bit arrogant. Thus, he added, &ldquo;However, becoming the strongest is my goal.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why must you seek to become the strongest? Do you want the entire world to bow before you?&rdquo; asked the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Why then?&rdquo; asked the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Only by becoming the strongest will I be able to protect the people that I want to protect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, there will always be people that can push me around. There will always be people that can put their hands on the people that I want to protect. This sort of hidden danger brings me unease,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Thus, the reason why you want to become the strongest is because you want to protect others?&rdquo; asked the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Senior, to tell you the truth, my close relatives were once massacred by others. Not a single person was spared.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That feeling of helplessness and grief is forever engraved in this junior&rsquo;s memories. Never will I ever forget it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even though it was later discovered that they were still alive, I don't wish to experience the feeling of losing my close relatives again.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, the world of martial cultivators is simply too cruel. Even though I don't wish to provoke others, others will come to provoke me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if I'm completely silent while walking down the road, if others are to feel unpleasant whilst looking at me, they might try to kill me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I want my close relatives to be safe, I must become the strongest,&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke with determination.<br>The words Chu Feng spoke were from the bottom of his heart, the goal that he had held onto the entire time.<br>Back in the Nine Provinces Continent, due to the fact that Chu Feng had offended people, the Chu Heavenly Clan had ended up being massacred.<br>That was a pain forever engraved in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart. Even though the people from the Chu Family were revived by his father Chu Xuanyuan, even though Chu Feng&rsquo;s major blunder was made up for, the pain that he felt from it was still real, something that had truly happened.<br>To Chu Feng, the pain that was deeply engraved in him had affected him enormously.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let me tell you something,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Senior, please speak away,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;If you have people that you want to protect, then you must truly work hard, harder than ever, so much that you&rsquo;ll put your own life on the line.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason for that is because the current you is simply too small and weak. You yourself are being protected by others, thus how could you possibly protect anyone?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If this is all you&rsquo;re capable of, when true calamity descends upon you, you will not be powerlessly seeing yourself confronted with death. Instead, you will be powerlessly witnessing your family members face death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Earlier, when I tried to kill you, you felt despair, right?&rdquo; asked the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;You need to understand that there are a lot of people in the martial cultivation world that possess the same power that this old man possesses. It is not that experts are few, it&rsquo;s simply that you all are too weak.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you don't try your hardest to train, then your family, your friends and the people that you love will all face that sort of despair. Furthermore, at that time, it will not be a test. Instead, they will truly be confronted with death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man is most definitely not trying to scare you with frightening words. At the very least, this old man is completely serious when saying these words to you. What I said is all the truth.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted picked up the Evil God Sword that was placed onto the ground.<br>&ldquo;Did you know that there&rsquo;s an evil demon within this Demon Sword?&rdquo; asked the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;This junior knows,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;However, it is sealed. Did you know that?&rdquo; asked the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Senior, by seal, when did that happen?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It should&rsquo;ve happened only a couple years ago. If this old man guesses correctly, that demon would not obediently allow you to use its power in the past.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, now, apart from causing a backlash upon your body, it is unable to actually injure you. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, how did you know about that?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt shocked.<br>It was as the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted had said. In the past, whenever Chu Feng had used the Evil God Sword, it would try to devour his soul and seize his body.<br>However, now, even though the Evil God Sword would still inflict a backlash upon Chu Feng, the Evil God within the sword had disappeared, and would no longer try to seize his body.<br>&ldquo;Because it has been sealed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, this old man is capable of determining from the aura on the demon sword that it has accompanied you for quite some time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If this old man guesses correctly, it must&rsquo;ve harmed you and tried to seize your body. Am I correct?&rdquo; asked the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Correct,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;However, it is now sealed. Thus, it is unable to seize your body anymore,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Senior, in that case, do you know how it was sealed?&rdquo; Chu Feng was very curious as to the reason why the Evil God Sword had suddenly become that way.<br>&ldquo;It was naturally sealed by a martial cultivator,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>The Evil God Sword had always been by Chu Feng&rsquo;s side the entire time. He was truly unable to think of a time when someone else came into contact with the Evil God Sword.<br>&ldquo;When you do not know who it might be, how could this old man possibly know?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While I am able to sense your aura, I'm simply unable to sense that individual&rsquo;s aura. It could only be said that this individual possesses unfathomable strength.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While they cannot be considered to be the strongest in this era, they will definitely still be a well-known figure,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Senior, do you truly not know?&rdquo; Chu Feng grew even more curious upon hearing the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s words.<br>If he didn&rsquo;t hear it from the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted, Chu Feng truly wouldn&rsquo;t know that such an existence had appeared beside him before, and had even helped him place a seal on the Evil God Sword.<br>Help, this was most definitely help. If that person wasn&rsquo;t trying to help him, why would they seal the Evil God Sword and not take it away?<br>Wasn&rsquo;t that person simply doing so with the intention to have Chu Feng protect himself with the power of the Evil God Sword?<br>Thus, the more Chu Feng thought about it, the more curious he became. He truly wanted to know exactly who that person might be.<br>&ldquo;When even you do not know who that person is, how could this old man possibly know?&rdquo; The Blood-devouring Demon Exalted shook his head. Then, he looked to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Thus, judging from your reaction, you must not know about the formation that was placed on you, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Formation? What formation?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;In that case, do you know anyone that is close to the True God realm?&rdquo; asked the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t believe so,&rdquo; Chu Feng answered after thinking carefully.<br>&ldquo;Haha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man understands now,&rdquo; suddenly, the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted laughed. Then, he said to Chu Feng, &ldquo;Since that person does not wish for you to know, you shouldn&rsquo;t bother guessing anymore. When the time is right, the truth will reveal itself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for this demon sword, this old man will help you seal it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man is doing that for your good. You cannot rely on external power. You must rely on yourself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m not saying that I&rsquo;m going to forever refuse to allow you to rely on external power. Merely, you cannot do so right now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you end up relying on it, it will be extremely detrimental to your future cultivation,&rdquo; said the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted.<br>&ldquo;Senior, this junior swears that unless it is during a moment of absolute crisis, I will definitely not use the power of the Evil God Sword.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng knew very well that he was still too weak.<br>Even though the Evil God Sword was unable to contend against an existence of the Blood-devouring Demon Exalted&rsquo;s level, it was very powerful in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>With that sword in hand, Chu feng would be able to protect himself, his friends and his relatives.<br></p></div>
