        <h1>Chapter 1833</h1>
        <div> - You Shouldn&rsquo;t Deceive Me<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you have truly brought me one pleasant surprise after another,&rdquo; At this moment, Baili Xuankong was looking at Chu Feng with smiles all over his face.<br>Seeing the excited appearance of the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts, he had realized that the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts were truly considering Chu Feng to be their great benefactor. In the future, there would no longer be any King Monstrous Dragon Beast who would dare to make things difficult for Chu Feng.<br>Not only that, even at the time when the Four Great Imperial Clans were sparing no effort to kill Chu Feng, the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts, this enormous power, was willing to protect Chu Feng. This was truly a matter worthy of great joy.<br>Afterward, the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts held a grand feast at their largest plaza. On the one hand, they were announcing to the rest of their clansmen that Yaojiao Tingyu had managed to obtain their Lord Dragon King&rsquo;s inheritance so that they could celebrate together.<br>On the other hand, they were gathering all the people from their race to thank Chu Feng. They were having all of the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts remember what Chu Feng, their great benefactor, looked like.<br>This feast continued for a total of three days and three nights. However, even then, it was still going on. After inquiring about it, Chu Feng found out that they were planning to continue the feast for a total of at least ten days and ten nights before concluding the feast.<br>Even though the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts wanted Chu Feng to stay in their city for an extended period of time, Chu Feng did not wish to continue to stay.<br>Firstly, Chu Feng did not wish to implicate the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts. After all, the walls had ears.<br>As there were scum like Yaojiao Ba and Yaojiao Xueran among the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts, there would definitely be other scum like them.<br>Even though the majority of the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts saw Chu Feng as their great benefactor and felt extremely grateful toward him, Chu Feng felt that it was certain that a portion of the War Faction&rsquo;s King Monstrous Dragon Beasts viewed him as their enemy.<br>After all, Yaojiao Ba had been in power in the King Monstrous Dragon Race for so long. He would definitely have people extremely loyal to him. If those who were extremely loyal to Yaojiao Ba were to spread news of Chu Feng being among the King Monstrous Dragon Race, the King Monstrous Dragon Race would likely not be able to withstand a joint effort of suppression from the Four Great Imperial Clans.<br>At that time, it would not only be Chu Feng who would suffer. Instead, he would have implicated the entire King Monstrous Dragon Race. The gains at that time would truly not make up for the losses. Chu Feng would also not be able to shoulder the responsibility.<br>Thus, Chu Feng found Yaojiao Guang and Yaojiao Tingyu. He had something that he needed to tell them.<br>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>At this moment Chu Feng, Hong Qiang, Baili Xuankong, Yaojiao Tingyu and Yaojiao Guang arrived at a quiet side palace.<br>&ldquo;Yoh, Tingyu, you&rsquo;ve become a rank nine Half Martial Emperor already. The Beast Emperor&rsquo;s power is truly enormous,&rdquo; Chu Feng felt slightly envious of Yaojiao Tingyu upon seeing her current cultivation of rank nine Half Martial Emperor.<br>&ldquo;Lord Dragon King&rsquo;s power is indeed extremely strong. I am not boasting here. After inheriting this power, I am confident that I will be able to reach the Martial Emperor realm within a year&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; Yaojiao Tingyu said joyously.<br>Her current reaction was understandable. After all, she was only a rank five Half Martial Emperor three days ago. Yet, she was already a rank nine Half Martial Emperor now. Furthermore, her aura was still increasing in strength. With this sort of change, how could she not be joyous? Not to mention her, if anyone else were to obtain this power, they too would be in great joy.<br>&ldquo;Tingyu, you are being too modest. There is simply no need for a year. In at the very most three months, and at the minimum half a month, you will become a rank one Martial Emperor,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That fast?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Yaojiao Tingyu revealed an ecstatic expression. She was so happy that she directly stood up. After all the things that had happened, she deeply believed in anything that Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t deceive you. No matter what, I am a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist? Little friend Chu Feng, you said you&rsquo;re a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Yaojiao Guang was immediately startled.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, so you&rsquo;ve not only broken through to rank eight Half Martial Emperor, you&rsquo;ve also become a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist?&rdquo; Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang were both looking at Chu Feng with overjoyed expressions.<br>They all knew that Chu Feng had become a rank eight Half Martial Emperor. After all, Chu Feng&rsquo;s aura was right in front of them. However, if Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t reveal his world spirit technique, they would not be able to see what level he was at. Thus, none of them had known that Chu Feng had become a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.<br>&ldquo;Actually, it&rsquo;s all thanks to Lord Beast Emperor that I was able to break through to rank eight Half Martial Emperor and become a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. It was all because of Lord Beast Emperor&rsquo;s power left in the Inheritance Pond,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Great, great, great! This is truly an extremely good thing to have happened. Everyone knows that you have killed White-browed Immortal. This led to there being one less Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist in the Holy Land of Martialism. Because of that, many people were speaking maliciously of you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if you are to let the people of the Holy Land of Martialism know that you&rsquo;ve also become a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, and the youngest one to have ever done so in history, I wonder what those who speak ill of you would think,&rdquo; Yaojiao Guang felt extremely happy for Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Boy, why didn&rsquo;t you inform us of such an enormously happy occasion sooner?&rdquo; Baili Xuankong said in a slightly complaining manner. He was feeling joyous for Chu Feng from the bottom of his heart. After all, Chu Feng was his hope, his pride.<br>That was also the reason why he was complaining. He blamed Chu Feng for not telling him of this matter sooner so that they couldn&rsquo;t be happy about this sooner.<br>&ldquo;Ancestor, don&rsquo;t you know about it now?&rdquo; Chu Feng laughed mischievously.<br>&ldquo;Actually, Lord Beast Emperor not only helped me with these. He also left behind some items. These items are extremely important. As such, Chu Feng does not dare to accept them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, as these items are truly too important, I do not dare to reveal them publicly. That is why, after considering it, I have decided that they should be handed to the current Clan Chief of the King Monstrous Dragon Race,&rdquo; Chu Feng handed the Stellar Key and the stone title plate to Yaojiao Guang.<br>Yaojiao Guang did not accept them. Instead, he asked,  &ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, what are these?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They were left behind by Lord Beast Emperor. They are treasures to open the Moonlight Maze. I think that the treasures Lord Beast Emperor obtained throughout his lifetime must be hidden in the Moonlight Maze,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Ah? This!!!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the expressions of Yaojiao Guang, Yaojiao Tingyu and even Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang changed enormously. After a moment of shock, they grew silent. They were all silently staring at the key and title plate in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand. It was unknown what they were thinking about right now.<br>After a long while, Yaojiao Guang asked, &ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, why would they be in your possession?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truth be told, when Tingyu was receiving the inheritance, Chu Feng entered an illusionary world. I met Lord Beast Emperor there. It was he who handed those things to me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, was that illusionary world filled with whist mist, and did it have eight enormous sculptures?&rdquo; Yaojiao Guang asked.<br>&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; Chu Feng nodded.<br>&ldquo;So that was what happened. This is Heaven&rsquo;s Will, it is simply Heaven&rsquo;s Will,&rdquo; After hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s confirmation, Yaojiao Guang smiled a relieved smile. It was as if an enormous burden that had just landed on him was cast away.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, you shouldn&rsquo;t deceive me,&rdquo; Yaojiao Guang said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, Chu Feng has not deceived you,&rdquo; Chu Feng was startled. Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang were also startled.<br>&ldquo;Haha, you&rsquo;re still saying that you didn&rsquo;t deceive me?&rdquo; Yaojiao Guang laughed. Then, he said, &ldquo;Lord Dragon King in that illusionary world must have said that he was planning to pass his treasures on to you. Why did you not tell me that? Why are you instead returning these treasures to me?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng, Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang all heaved a sigh of relief. It turned out this was what Yaojiao Guang had meant when he said deceive.<br></p></div>
