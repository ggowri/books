        <h1>Chapter 4459</h1>
        <div>: This Is Weird <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The disciple of the Godwish Grandmother stood before Chu Feng with the same appearance as she had before&mdash;a short and lanky stature, dried and wrinkled skin, snowy long hair, an arched back, and a hoarse voice.<br>All of these were saying that she was an old woman.<br>But an old woman shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to step through that formation, which meant that her appearance was fake.<br>She was actually a junior.<br>It was just that her disguise was too advanced that Chu Feng was unable to see through it.<br>Otherwise, it might be due to a mutation in her body that resulted in her having an old body but a young soul.<br>&ldquo;Elder, are you a junior too?&rdquo; Chu Feng voiced his incomprehension.<br>&ldquo;Have I ever said that I&rsquo;m not a junior?&rdquo;<br>The disciple of the Godwish Grandmother spoke furiously as she swiftly approached Chu Feng.<br>Sss!<br>Watching as the fuming disciple of the Godwish Grandmother got closer and closer to him, Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but take a sharp intake of breath.<br>Things weren&rsquo;t going according to his plan, and this left him feeling a little flustered.<br>He knew that what that was going to happen next wouldn&rsquo;t be good news to him.<br>However, his gaze soon changed. He noticed that the butterflies fluttering around the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother had morphed into a flowing stream of light before seeping into her body.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng could also sense a peculiar surge of energy flowing into his body, melding together with his flesh. As it turned out, the butterflies that were fluttering around him had also entered his body as well.<br>Sensing all of these changes, a smile crept onto Chu Feng&rsquo;s lips, and the fluster he felt a moment ago vanished without a trace.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that you are a junior like me. I have been deeply disrespectful for calling a young person like you an elder. Elder, may I know how you would prefer me to address you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile.<br>The air of nervousness around him dissipated, and he reverted back to his usual carefree self.<br>&ldquo;You sure have a lot of crap to talk about. Sure, go on and continue running your mouth. You might not be able to do so very soon anyway,&rdquo; the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother sneered as her robe began fluttering.<br>Once again, she released her rank one Martial Exalted level oppressive might toward Chu Feng to suppress him.<br>Weng!<br>But this time around, for some unfathomable reason, Chu Feng was completely unfazed by her oppressive might. He stood idly on the spot, not showing any hint of pain or unease at all.<br>This sight shocked the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother.<br>While she had held back a little so as to ensure that Chu Feng&rsquo;s life wouldn&rsquo;t be in danger, that strike should have still been enough to inflict severe injuries on him.<br>Never in her wildest imagination did she think that things would turn out like that.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; that energy?&rdquo;<br>The disciple of the Godwish Grandmother was so infuriated at Chu Feng that she hadn&rsquo;t noticed the changes with the butterflies. It was only at this moment that she realized that they were no longer fluttering around them.<br>She quickly took a look at herself and noticed that her body had undergone a few changes as well.<br>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;<br>She finally understood why Chu Feng was able to remain unfazed under her attack.<br>It was the power of the butterflies at work here.<br>She could feel it clearly because she had the very same butterflies within her body too.<br>It was just that this power wasn&rsquo;t very apparent, and she had to intentionally tap into it in order to draw out its power.<br>This power allowed her to change the properties of her body, granting it unwavering resilience and unshakable strength.<br>Shoosh!<br>The disciple of the Godwish Grandmother charged at Chu Feng once more.<br>This time, instead of using martial power or any weapons, she was using her own body to attack Chu Feng.<br>The buff from the butterflies was extremely powerful, such that even the strength of a Martial Exalted level cultivator like her paled in comparison to it. She knew that Chu Feng&rsquo;s body had been buffed by the energy of the butterflies too, so he couldn&rsquo;t be hurt by her cultivation or other means anymore.<br>If she wanted to deal with Chu Feng, she would have to use the buff of the butterflies against him.<br>All it took was a single instant for her to close in the distance between Chu Feng and her, and she began to rain down blows on him.<br>On the other hand, Chu Feng dared not to let his guard down either.<br>While the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother was unable to hurt him, he couldn&rsquo;t say the same about her fists, especially since she had received the buff of the butterflies too.<br>However, Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t willing to cross hands with the disciple of the Godwish Palace either, so he ended up retreating again and again while dodging her attacks.<br>It was a blessing that the buff had improved his movement speed and enhanced his reflexes too, so he was able to easily avoid all of her attacks.<br>&ldquo;Elder, you can&rsquo;t blame me for doing this either. It wasn&rsquo;t easy for me to have the opportunity to enter this place, and I&rsquo;m curious to see just how the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword looks like. Since both you and I are qualified to obtain the Hero&rsquo;s Sword, why don&rsquo;t we compete fairly instead? Don&rsquo;t you think that it&rsquo;s unfair for you to use your cultivation to suppress me? It was also out of no choice that I ended up having to deceive you,&rdquo; Chu Feng explained as he dodged her attacks.<br>&ldquo;Cut the crap! Those who dare to make a fool out of me will have to pay the price for their deception. Even if the sky falls today, I&rsquo;ll be taking the Immemorial Hero&rsquo;s Sword with me today. I advised you to leave out of the goodwill of my heart, but you still chose to stick around like an obstinate mule. Since that&rsquo;s the case, don&rsquo;t blame me for not showing mercy then!&rdquo;<br>As the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother spoke, her attacks grew more and more aggressive. If even a single punch were to land on Chu Feng, he would be injured.<br>&ldquo;Elder, must one of us die here in order for things to come to rest?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked grimly.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Only one of us will be walking out of here alive today!&rdquo; the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother roared.<br>Shoosh!<br>But right after she said those words, Chu Feng suddenly stopped retreating. Instead, he took a step forward, causing the distance between him and the other party to become frighteningly close.<br>Pah pah!<br>Before the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother could even react, her hands had been locked down by Chu Feng. Following that, he pulled her hands toward her chest and struck her down.<br>The force was so great that with a loud &lsquo;putong&rsquo;, the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother was pressed down to the ground, completely immobilized.<br>In that instant, the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother knew that the tables had turned on her.<br>Who could have thought that three butterflies would create such a huge disparity in their prowess?<br>In a direct clash, she was no match for Chu Feng at all.<br>And what that left her even more unnerved was that after pinning her down, Chu Feng was staring at her deeply with his eyes. There was a smile on his lips that made her feel deeply uneasy.<br>&ldquo;Insolence! Chu Feng, what are you trying to do here?&rdquo; the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother bellowed in a fluster.<br>&ldquo;What am I trying to do here? Elder, only one of us will be walking out of here alive. You were the one who said these words yourself!&rdquo;<br>Speaking up to this point, a vicious glint flashed across Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes.<br>Seeing this, the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother knew that she was doomed.<br>She felt deeply indignant. How could she lose just like that to the man before her? She was supposed to be the stronger one here!<br>Swoosh!<br>But just as she thought that she was going to be killed, Chu Feng suddenly released her before walking away. As he left, his voice echoed loudly within the cavern, &ldquo;But elder, if I were to have a say in this matter, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if the two of us live? Let&rsquo;s compete fairly with our own means instead!&rdquo;<br>Even as the echo slowly faded into silence, the disciple of the Godwish Grandmother didn&rsquo;t get back up.<br>&ldquo;Is that lad really letting me off?&rdquo;<br>She was deeply surprised by the sight before her because the Chu Feng she knew was definitely no kind soul. He wasn&rsquo;t the type of person to go easy on her just because she was a woman.<br>Based on what she thought of Chu Feng, given what she had done to him thus far, even if he were to spare her life, he would have still taught her a lesson.<br>Yet, he was leaving just like that without leaving behind any vicious words or anything?<br>Was it because he feared her master?<br>That could be possible, but based on what she knew of Chu Feng, she didn&rsquo;t think that he was the type to hold back because of anyone.<br></p></div>
