        <h1>Chapter 5165</h1>
        <div>: The Mysterious Master of the Monastery<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The location indicated on the ingredients list was a monastery.<br>While Bittersea Lower Realm was a Lower Realm, its territory was much larger than that of the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. It took some time for Chu Feng and City Lord Liang to get to their destination.<br>&ldquo;City Lord Liang, I encountered an old cat inside Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s ancient remnant. By any chance, are you acquainted with it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked along the way.<br>He figured that City Lord Liang might have something to do with Old Cat&rsquo;s appearance in the ancient remnant, though it was just a guess at this point. It would be great if City Lord Liang did know a thing or two about Old Cat, or else it was at least worth a try.<br>&ldquo;An old cat?&rdquo;<br>City Lord Liang&rsquo;s eyes subconsciously narrowed. His reaction told Chu Feng that they were definitely acquainted with each other.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t probe any further, but he kept his eyes on City Lord Liang, waiting for the latter to continue on.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, did it make a move on you?&rdquo; City Lord Liang asked.<br>&ldquo;It nearly took my life. I was able to subdue it, but it managed to escape in the end,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Haaa&hellip;&rdquo;<br>City Lord Liang let out a long sigh. There was a conflicted look on his face.<br>&ldquo;City Lord Liang, you were the one who provided the old cat with the information regarding the ancient remnant, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng got straight to the point.<br>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be talking about this. There&rsquo;s nothing more important than confidentiality for those in our trade. However, I am willing to make an exception for you. You&rsquo;re Lord Yuwei&rsquo;s current master, and I&rsquo;m indebted to you for saving my entire clan. Since that fellow nearly took your life, it&rsquo;d prick my conscience if I don&rsquo;t tell you what I know about it,&rdquo; City Lord Liang said.<br>&ldquo;City Lord Liang, I can understand if you have your reservations talking about this,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>He did want to gather information about Old Cat, especially since this was his only clue to Xue Ji. However, City Lord Liang had risked his life to save Song Yuwei, so he didn&rsquo;t put City Lord Liang in a difficult position.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ve already gone into retirement, so my reputation means nothing at this point. That person calls itself Lord Tiger, and I have had many dealings with him. I was also the one who provided him with information about the ancient remnant.<br>&ldquo;However, young master Chu Feng, I hope that you won&rsquo;t spread what I&rsquo;m going to tell you around. Lord Tiger isn&rsquo;t a forgiving person. It&rsquo;s already tough enough to have the Situ World Spiritist Clan on my back; I don&rsquo;t want to make another enemy out of Lord Tiger,&rdquo; City Lord Liang said.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, City Lord Liang. Whatever you said today will be kept between us. I won&rsquo;t tell a third soul,&rdquo; Chu Feng guaranteed.<br>&ldquo;What do you wish to know, young master Chu Feng?&rdquo; City Lord Liang asked.<br>&ldquo;I want to know where it lives,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>In the following conversation, Chu Feng learned that even though City Lord Liang had worked together with Old Cat on many occasions, he knew very little about the latter. It wasn&rsquo;t that surprising considering Old Cat&rsquo;s cunning and careful nature. It wouldn&rsquo;t easily reveal its place of residence to others.<br>Other than that, Chu Feng also learned that Old Cat was particularly fond of exploring ancient remnants, and it would often be able to make huge gains. Without a doubt, it possessed exceptional means. That was also something Chu Feng was aware of.<br>Unfortunately, City Lord Liang didn&rsquo;t know much other than that.<br>Soon, the two of them arrived at the monastery where they were to buy their ingredients from. It was reminiscent of a small palace located in the middle of a remote mountain range, but surprisingly, there were long queues in front of it.<br>&ldquo;So many people? Are they all here to buy ingredients?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I did hear from Master Bitter Remembrance that the owner of the monastery is a mysterious person. Few have seen his true appearance, but he does possess true abilities,&rdquo; City Lord Liang said.<br>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;<br>That piqued Chu Feng&rsquo;s curiosity.<br>He thought that the Bittersea Lower Realm would be filled with weaker cultivators, just like those in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Bitter Remembrance was just the exception here, choosing to humble himself in this place.<br>However, when he looked at those queuing up in front of the monastery, they were actually fairly strong, albeit not on par with Bitter Remembrance. The fact that cultivators of their strength weren&rsquo;t causing trouble here was testimony to the monastery owner&rsquo;s strength.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, our identities are a little sensitive at the moment. Should we conceal our appearances?&rdquo; City Lord Liang asked.<br>&ldquo;You should do that, City Lord Liang. I can&rsquo;t disguise myself due to a reason,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Oh? May I know the reason?&rdquo; City Lord Liang asked.<br>It was beneficial for them to conceal their identity now considering how they had already crossed the Situ World Spiritist Clan, so he was interested to know why Chu Feng was refusing to do so.<br>&ldquo;I promised a friend that I wouldn&rsquo;t conceal my appearance,&rdquo; Chu Feng chose not to speak the truth.<br>It was not that he couldn&rsquo;t disguise himself, but that a mysterious man had kidnapped Zhao Hong and threatened Chu Feng to never disguise himself from that day onward. Unless in a desperate position, he didn&rsquo;t want to break that promise lest Zhao Hong gets hurt.<br>&ldquo;How about this? I&rsquo;ll conceal myself and tail you from the shadows. However, this means that you&rsquo;ll have to be the one negotiating the trade,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That sounds good.&rdquo;<br>City Lord Liang nodded in agreement. He quickly changed his appearance whereas Chu Feng concealed himself. The two of them landed near the cliff.<br>Weng!<br>Shortly after they landed, the ground suddenly trembled. It forcefully dispelled Chu Feng&rsquo;s concealment.<br>The slight tremors caught the attention of those in the queue, and they quickly turned their sights to the two of them. They soon lost interest and retracted their gazes, but there were hints of hostility in their eyes. It might have been because they thought that the two of them were the cause of the earlier tremors.<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, why did you show yourself?&rdquo; City Lord Liang asked via voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it voluntarily,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;<br>City Lord Liang was surprised to hear that.<br></p></div>
