        <h1>Chapter 3088</h1>
        <div> - The Truth Of What Happened Back Then<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Miss Xia, it&rsquo;s been a long time,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Xia Yun&rsquo;er with a smile on his face.<br>"It&rsquo;s been a long time, Young Master Chu," Xia Yun'er smiled in return.<br>The two of them both had smiles on their faces. They resembled old friends as they chatted. As for the other people of the younger generation present, they were all ignored by the two of them.<br>Had it been before, Chu Feng being able to chat with Xia Yun'er in such a manner would definitely bring about countless people's envy and jealousy. In fact, they would even feel hatred and killing intent toward Chu Feng.<br>After all, Xia Yun'er was one of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm's publicly accepted Three Great Beauties, and the Starfall Holy Land's Holy Daughter.<br>However, at that moment, there were not a lot of people that were envious of Chu Feng. Instead, more people were envious of Xia Yun'er.<br>After all, things was different from before. Chu Feng was no longer that greenhorn that even someone like Chu Xianshuo could bully.<br>The current Chu Feng was standing at the apex of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>He was someone that could even defeat an existence like Li Anzhi.<br>How could there be another person of the younger generation in the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm that would dare to bully Chu Feng?<br>At that moment, everyone realized one thing.<br>From that moment on, there would be two kinds of geniuses in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.<br>The first kind was Chu Feng. As for the second kind, it was everyone else.<br>......<br>Eventually, all banquets will come to an end. The Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition was the same.<br>This was especially true now that the Upper Realm Gate had opened, and the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm would face the great enemy known as the Li Heavenly Clan.<br>Thus, after the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief pacified the crowd's nervousness, the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition came to an end.<br>After the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition ended, the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief began to discuss countermeasures against the Li Heavenly Clan with the Chu Heavenly Clan's upper echelons.<br>As for Chu Feng, he arrived at the residence of the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief.<br>The reason for that was because the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief said he had matters to discuss with Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng quietly waited for the return of the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng also had important matters that he wished to discuss with the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief.<br>"Creak~~"<br>Finally, that tightly-closed palace gate was pushed open. Then, a familiar figure walked in.<br>That person was none other than the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief.<br>After walking in, the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief asked Chu Feng with a smile on his face, "Chu Feng, you wouldn't blame this old man, right?"<br>He simply did not look like a clan chief. Instead, he was acting more like Chu Feng's grandfather, and his eyes were filled with affection.<br>"This junior doesn't understand what senior means by that. Why would I blame senior?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"I have pretended to be Youyuan and deceived you for so long," The Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng came to a sudden realization. He smiled and said, "Senior has done all that for my sake. As such, how could junior blame senior?"<br>"Actually, I had done that with selfish motives too. I wanted to observe you by being near you so as to verify your moral character. That said, you have truly not disappointed this old man. You greatly resemble your father and grandfather."<br>"To this date, our Chu Heavenly Clan has grown exponentially, and our clansmen number in the millions. However, the most outstanding blood of our Chu Heavenly Clan only runs in your veins."<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief's eyes were focused onto Chu Feng when he said those words. Chu Feng was able to sense deep expectations in his eyes.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng's heart moved. He was able to tell that there was a deeper implication to the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief's words.<br>He first praised Chu Feng's grandfather and father. And now, he was saying that Chu Feng had the most outstanding blood flowing through him.<br>Furthermore, he was very emotional when he said those words. This meant that not only did the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief recognize Chu Feng's grandfather and father's strength, but he also held deep affection for them.<br>Chu Feng felt that it was time for him to state what he wanted to say the most.<br>After all, his actual purpose in returning to the Chu Heavenly Clan was to have the Chu Heavenly Clan agree to release his father after gaining their acknowledgement. Only by doing so would Chu Feng be able to gain information about his mother from his father.<br>Thus, after adjusting his frame of mind, Chu Feng said, "Senior, my father might have been rude and impetuous back then. However, he has already suffered for all these years."<br>"Furthermore, the Chu Heavenly Clan is currently faced with the great enemy that is the Li Heavenly Clan. Our Chu Heavenly Clan is in need of strong battle power."<br>"Might it be possible..."<br>However, before Chu Feng could finish, the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief waved his hand and said, "Chu Feng, this old man understands your intention."<br>Chu Feng was surprised to hear those words.<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief looked to Chu Feng with a complicated expression again.<br>"Chu Feng, what you know is actually not the truth as to what happened back then."<br>"Firstly, you need to know how powerful your father was."<br>"With his strength, our Chu Heavenly Clan is simply unable to restrain him," The Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng's heart moved. An indescribable sensation was surging from his heart.<br>Chu Feng was dumbfounded. Since the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief knew very well that they could not contain his father, why then did they decide to imprison his father in their Chu Heavenly Clan's forbidden area?<br>"Chu Feng, do you think that this old man is such a muddle-headed person?"<br>"Did you really think that I would imprison your father just because of some remarks from our clansmen?" The Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief said with a smile.<br>Unable to contain himself, Chu Feng asked, "Senior, exactly what happened?"<br>As matters stood, Chu Feng firmly believed that there was another reason for what happened back then.<br>"Firstly, you need to understand why your father had to leave the Ancestral Martial Starfield."<br>"The reason for that is because, with his talent, if he were to continue to grow, our Chu Heavenly Clan would definitely have become the overlord of the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield under his leadership."<br>"However, the current overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, that is the people of the Starfield Master Realm, would definitely not allow that to happen."<br>"Thus, if your father wanted to continue to grow, he had to leave the Ancestral Martial Starfield."<br>"...just like your grandfather did back then," The Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief said.<br>"In that case, both my grandfather and father were forced to leave?" Chu Feng asked.<br>"That's right. If they didn't leave, they would be viciously attacked by the Starfield Master Realm. After all, they would not allow anyone to threaten their position as the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield."<br>"That said, the Starfields outside are far superior to our Ancestral Martial Starfield. They are filled with countless experts, and are extremely dangerous."<br>"That is why even someone like your grandfather ended up going missing for many years. Even now, his life and death is unknown."<br>After saying those words, the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief sighed. His sigh was filled with helplessness.<br>"The main culprit behind all this is the Starfield Master Realm. They were the ones that forced my grandfather and father to leave this place and risk their lives in other Starfields."<br>At that moment, deep anger began to surge in Chu Feng's eyes. However, his expression immediately changed. He said, "In that case, it would mean that the main reason why my father was imprisoned was also because of the Starfield Master Realm?"<br>"I wouldn't say it is all because of them. With your father's return, the Starfield Master Realm would naturally pay close attention to him. As your father killed people from the Starfield Master Realm, the Starfield Master Realm would naturally use that as justification to take care of your father."<br>"However, the Starfield Master Realm is not the main reason why I imprisoned your father. The main reason is because your father... provoked a power many times more powerful than the Starfield Master Realm," The Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief said.<br></p></div>
