        <h1>Chapter 4790</h1>
        <div>: Above Chu Feng<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The massive size of the monster only became more apparent the closer it approached, leaving the disciples feeling even smaller and more powerless. At the same time, the pressure they felt seemed to be intensifying.<br>They weren&rsquo;t sure that it was a good idea to allow such a terrifying monster to get close to them, but they knew that running wasn&rsquo;t an option. They didn&rsquo;t know what was the fate that had befallen those who had been dragged back into the spirit formation gate. For all they knew, they might have been killed.<br>So, they decided to trust Chu Feng here.<br>Nevertheless, their cowardice still led to them slowly backing away. Even Xia Yan had chosen to take cover behind Chu Feng, grasping onto his robe tightly.<br>However, Chu Feng glanced at Xia Yan and rolled his eyes. It was possible for the others to get scared, but as for Xia Yan&hellip; he had a feeling that she was just feigning it.<br>Other than Chu Feng, the only one who didn&rsquo;t retreat at all was Zuoqiu Youyu. He hadn&rsquo;t shown the slightest hint of fear all this while.<br>While his cultivation was on the same level as Zuoqiu Yanliang, his guts made him more worthy of the title as the strongest disciple.<br>Boom!<br>The earth trembled for one last time before everything gradually settled down.<br>The massive giant stopped at a distance of around thirty thousand meters away from the disciples.<br>Grar!<br>While it had stopped its footsteps, it suddenly opened its massive mouth, releasing a nasty stench. At the same time, the pressure crushing down on the crowd intensified.<br>Many disciples closed their eyes fearfully, thinking that it was all over.<br>However, they soon realized that despite the increasing pressure, the giant didn&rsquo;t launch any attack against them. They slowly opened their eyes to take a peek, only to be surprised by what they were seeing.<br>The giant had opened its mouth, revealing a tongue filled with inverted spikes. At the very tip of its tongue sat an old man.<br>The old man shared a striking resemblance with the giant, but his size made him seem more like a human. In fact, he was even shorter than Chu Feng and the other youths present in the area.<br>The giant only had a cloth concealing his crotch whereas the old man sitting on top of the tongue was fully clothed. His clothes were a little tattered, but it made him look a bit more dignified.<br>&ldquo;To be able to draw me out of my mountain, it looks like a great prodigy stands amongst you. It surprises me that not only is there someone who managed to enter this place with his own capability, but there are also multiple people who have released the Yinyang Shackles on their own volition.<br>&ldquo;Those who have proven their guts will be rewarded. I shall bestow upon you a fortuitous encounter, but it&rsquo;ll be up to you whether you&rsquo;re able to get anything good out of it.&rdquo;<br>The monstrous elder reached for his chest and took out a horsetail whisk. Despite his tattered clothes, the horsetail whisk in his possession was clearly an exceptional tool. It had a smooth appearance that looked as if it had been sculpted out of white jade, and it emanated a powerful spirit power and the scent of the Ancient Era.<br>If Chu Feng had to make a comparison, his Celestial Master&rsquo;s Horsetail Whisk was nothing before this white jade horsetail whisk.<br>In fact, he had never seen such a formidable world spiritist treasure before. It was to the extent where every single disciple present could sense its immense prowess.<br>The gazes of the disciples changed upon laying their eyes on the horsetail whisk. Some were amazed by the immense power of the horsetail whisk, but there were also those whose eyes reddened with greed.<br>They didn&rsquo;t expect to see such invaluable treasure in the Yinyang Withered Well Realm.<br>Shoosh!<br>The monstrous elder flicked his horsetail whisk and pointed it at Song Qian. A divine ray of light gushed forth and shrouded her. It seemed to morph rapidly around her, and if one were to take a closer look, one could actually see a map amidst it.<br>It was just that the ray of light was changing far too quickly for anyone to interpret it.<br>&ldquo;My deepest gratitude, elder.&rdquo;<br>Frenzied joy broke out on Song Qian&rsquo;s face as she quickly kneeled onto the ground and kowtowed deeply.<br>Chu Feng guessed from Song Qian&rsquo;s response that the map had already been imprinted into her mind. Curious, he activated the Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes in an attempt to discern it, and the map that was blurry a moment ago immediately sharpened right before his eyes.<br>However, what he didn&rsquo;t notice was that the monstrous elder subconsciously shot him a glance as soon as he activated Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes. There was a peculiar gleam in his eyes.<br>Following that, the monstrous elder continued to flick the horsetail whisk in his hand. With every flick from him, a ray of light would fall upon an individual.<br>Soon, the crowd realized that the ones who were bestowed with the ray of light were the ones who had released the Yinyang Shackles and passed through the spirit formation passageway with their own prowess.<br>On top of that, there was a difference in the divinity in the ray of light they were bestowed with.<br>Weng!<br>It was finally Chu Feng&rsquo;s turn.<br>&ldquo;This aura&hellip; Incredible!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As expected of Chu Feng. He&rsquo;s indeed unlike the others!&rdquo;<br>The crowd directed envious looks in Chu Feng&rsquo;s direction upon seeing the ray of light he was shrouded in. The ray of light around him gushed into the sky, and the silhouette of a massive beast could be vaguely seen behind him. It was hard to tell what beast that was, but it was clear that it was no ordinary being.<br>It was to an extent where it felt more appropriate to call it a phenomenon.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, elder.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t kneel down and kowtow as Song Qian did, but he still lowered his head to express his gratitude.<br>It bewildered the crowd that Chu Feng&rsquo;s ray of light only had a beast and no map, but in Chu Feng&rsquo;s mind, he could see a clear map inscribed on the back of the beast.<br>This was likely to be the fortuitous encounter he had to look for.<br>&ldquo;Incredible! He&rsquo;s even more amazing than Chu Feng!&rdquo;<br>But while Chu Feng was still checking out the map, the crowd suddenly flew into a commotion. It turned out that Zuoqiu Youyu had received a ray of light as well, and his was even more blinding than Chu Feng&rsquo;s. His ray of light morphed into the form of a massive beast as well, but it looked even more complete and divine than Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>Putting all things aside, the light ray shrouding Zuoqiu Youyu had already surpassed Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>This was beyond the crowd&rsquo;s expectations. After all, Chu Feng was a prodigy who had broken Lord Dugu Lingtian&rsquo;s records multiple times.<br>Could this mean to say that Zuoqiu Youyu&rsquo;s skills surpassed Chu Feng when it came to world spiritist techniques?<br></p></div>
