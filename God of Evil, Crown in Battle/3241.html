        <h1>Chapter 3240</h1>
        <div> - World Transformation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Linghu Mingye was also a newcomer to the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm, he was beyond compare to Linghu Lun in all aspects.<br>It was not only his cultivation that was superior to Linghu Lun. Instead, he was outstanding all around.<br>In fact, there were people that believed that Linghu Mingye was someone who was destined to surpass Linghu Tiemian.<br>Thus, compared to Linghu Lun, Linghu Mingye was much more dangerous.<br>For Chu Feng to be confronted with such a frightening opponent, Dongguo Bingyu would naturally feel very worried.<br>Sure enough, Linghu Mingye was not a reckless and hot-headed fellow. After he entered the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, he did not ignorantly search for Chu Feng. Instead, he proceeded toward the central region of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>Linghu Mingye also did not use the tracking talisman to seek out Chu Feng. Instead, he sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes.<br>He was sitting there like he was waiting for Chu Feng and the others to come to him themselves. Linghu Mingye appeared to be very calm and composed.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng and the others had no idea that Linghu Mingye had entered the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>They continued with their search for new Ores of Light.<br>After three days of searching, Chu Feng and the others had practically extracted all of the Ores of Light.<br>When the final Ore of Light was extracted, an enormous change began to occur to the world.<br>The ground beneath Chu Feng and the others began to split open. Even space itself began to shatter. An enormous change was happening to that isolated world.<br>In the blink of an eye, the others that were beside Chu Feng all disappeared.<br>Even Chu Feng himself was sucked into the distorted space.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng felt as if he had entered an enormous spatial vortex, and was powerless to do anything.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed greatly. The reason for that was because he had no idea what was happening.<br>Whilst Chu Feng was confused as to what was happening, the scene that he saw deep inside that spirit formation, that scene of the battle between the creatures of the Ancient Era, appeared in Chu Feng&rsquo;s head.<br>Chu Feng did not know why such a change was happening to his surroundings. However, he had a slight feeling that the war he had witnessed seemed to be inextricably linked to this Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>There should be some sort of secret. Merely, Chu Feng was still unable to decipher it. If he was able to decipher the secret, he would definitely be able to profit from it.<br>Right at the moment when Chu Feng was thinking deeply, the distorted heaven and earth suddenly started to calm.<br>Chu Feng was lying on his stomach. When he raised his head, he discovered that Li Anzhi, Chu Haoyan, Chu Shuangshuang and the others were all near him. Furthermore, they were either lying on the ground or rolling around on the ground.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng himself felt slightly dizzy.<br>As for Chu Shuangshuang and the others, they were vomiting nonstop. They were so weak that their bodies were shivering.<br>It could be seen that the spatial distortion from earlier had greatly affected them.<br>&ldquo;The size of this Holy Spirit Formation of Light has decreased?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng realized an issue.<br>All of them were at the central region of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light right at that moment.<br>The entire Holy Spirit Formation of Light had become very, very, very small. It was now less than a ten thousandth the original size of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that you&rsquo;re very confused.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Actually, there&rsquo;s no need for you to be this puzzled. This sort of change will occur before the final phase of the Holy Spirit Formation of Light, the assimilation phase. Actually, the shrinking of the size of this world is precisely there to provide the martial cultivators in here an opportunity to battle.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After all, no matter how enormous this Holy Spirit Formation of Light might be, it is, in the end, a place where martial cultivators will fight one another,&rdquo; suddenly, a voice was heard.<br>Hearing that sudden voice, Chu Feng felt that the situation was bad. Turning toward the voice, he discovered a person standing in midair staring at him.<br>This was the first time Chu Feng had seen that person. However, after Chu Feng saw that person, he immediately started frowning.<br>The reason for that was because that man was not only a member of the Linghu Heavenly Clan, but his aura was also more powerful than Linghu Lun&rsquo;s.<br>He was a rank two Martial Immortal.<br>As for that man, he was naturally Linghu MIngye.<br>It was no wonder that Linghu Mingye had decided to stay in the central region so confidently. It turned out that he already knew that such a change would occur in the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>When the Holy Spirit Formation of Light shrunk, Chu Feng would not be able to escape.<br>&ldquo;You must be that Linghu Mingye that they spoke of, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Whilst scouting for information earlier, Chu Feng had already learned that there was an even more powerful fellow amongst the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s newcomers. As for that person, he was Linghu Mingye.<br>Merely, according to what Chu Feng had learned, Linghu Mingye had not entered the Holy Spirit Formation of Light.<br>&ldquo;That is correct,&rdquo; Linghu Mingye nodded.<br>Linghu Mingye had a very calm expression as he looked to Chu Feng. There was no trace of anger in his eyes at all. It was as if he were looking at a complete stranger.<br>&ldquo;It seems that you know this Holy Spirit Formation of Light very well,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about this Holy Spirit Formation of Light from an expert before. Thus, I know a bit more about this Holy Spirit Formation of Light compared to you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If my guess is correct, the spirit formation tunnel that you trapped Linghu Lun in should lead to the Holy Spirit Formation of Light&rsquo;s formation core. Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to take a look at that place,&rdquo; Linghu Mingye spoke with an expression of regret.<br>It was only after hearing what Linghu Mingye said that Chu Feng learned that the world that he had entered earlier was actually the Holy Spirit Formation of Light&rsquo;s formation core.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re truly quite knowledgeable about this Holy Spirit Formation of Light. Since you know so much about it, why didn&rsquo;t you come in from the very start?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been uninterested in things that don&rsquo;t pose any challenge at all. If I had entered from the very start, you all would not have been able to do anything at all,&rdquo; Linghu Mingye said.<br>&ldquo;If you had told Linghu Lun that the Holy Spirit Formation of Light would shrink before the arrival of the assimilation phase, he would not have gone through all the trouble to use the so-called tracking talismans to track us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Likewise, he would also not have been trapped by that spirit formation, and have his Symbol of Light stripped away by me. Thus, you shouldn&rsquo;t have hidden that information. Instead, you should&rsquo;ve informed him about everything,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;If I were to inform him about everything, it would not have been a challenge at all,&rdquo; Linghu Mingye replied.<br>&ldquo;In that case, you really have no interest in this Holy Spirit Formation of Light? If that&rsquo;s the case, it would mean that you&rsquo;ve come here purely to avenge Linghu Lun and the others?&rdquo; Chu feng asked.<br>&ldquo;As brothers of the same clan, it&rsquo;s only natural that I should avenge them. However, that&rsquo;s actually not the whole reason why I&rsquo;ve come here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Most importantly, there&rsquo;s currently someone that I&rsquo;m interested in in this Holy Spirit Formation of Light now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, I was actually quite disappointed when I saw you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It appears to me that, with your strength, it&rsquo;s simply impossible for you to contend against me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for your Fire Qilin Armor, it&rsquo;s also unable to stop me.&rdquo;<br>Linghu Mingye looked to Chu Feng and spoke with a mocking tone.<br>He had finally revealed his purpose for being there. He was there to take care of Chu Feng.<br></p></div>
