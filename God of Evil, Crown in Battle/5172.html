        <h1>Chapter 5171</h1>
        <div>: Yue Ling&rsquo;s Ancestor<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Chu Feng grabbed Yue Ling&rsquo;s hand, he noticed that Yue Ling&rsquo;s face turned even redder. He had seen many shy girls in his time, but this was the first time he had seen one as demure as her.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor, please follow me.&rdquo;<br>Perhaps aware of her reddened face, Yue Ling took a quick glance at Chu Feng before hurriedly lowering her head, not daring to meet his eye. She began pulling Chu Feng toward the barrier.<br>Weng!<br>The two of them successfully passed through the barrier.<br>On the other side of the barrier was a bamboo forest. It was at this moment that Chu Feng finally understood why Yue Ling&rsquo;s memories remained unaltered. He could sense a powerful recovery energy suffusing the entire bamboo forest.<br>The recovery energy must have restored Yue Ling&rsquo;s memories.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor, y-you can let go now,&rdquo; Yue Ling muttered meekly with a lowered head.<br>&ldquo;Ah, my apologies. I nearly forgot,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with an awkward smile as he released Yue Ling&rsquo;s hand.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor, please follow me.&rdquo;<br>Yue Ling led Chu Feng down a path in the bamboo forest. Along the way, Chu Feng saw some tombstones erected by the sides of the path. There were tributes placed in front of every tombstone.<br>There were incredibly condensed origin energies lingering inside each of the tombstones, granting a glimpse into how powerful these people were before their deaths.<br>&ldquo;They are?&rdquo; Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t resist asking.<br>&ldquo;They are the ancestors of my clan,&rdquo; Yue Ling replied as she continued walking on.<br>&ldquo;Your ancestors are formidable,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked in surprise.<br>Yue Ling definitely couldn&rsquo;t be considered to be strong, at least not by the standards of the Totem Galaxy. Thus, it was surprising to learn that she had so many formidable ancestors.<br>Soon, the two of them arrived at the other end of the bamboo forest, where a majestic palace that towered like a mountain came into sight. They entered the palace, only to find that it was utterly empty. Even the ground consisted of dirt, just like how it was outside.<br>The only thing inside the palace was a boulder placed in the center of the hall.<br>The boulder immediately caught Chu Feng&rsquo;s attention. It was filled with runes that recorded all kinds of information relating to world spiritist techniques. The recovery energy suffusing the bamboo forest was also coming from the boulder.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor, you&rsquo;re here for the legacy, right? The legacy is right here. However, it isn&rsquo;t easy to comprehend,&rdquo; Yue Ling pointed to the boulder and said.<br>She was rather smart to know that Chu Feng was here for the legacy, which was probably why she led him here.<br>&ldquo;To be honest with you, Yue Ling, I am indeed here for the legacy. Do you know where the legacy comes from?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;This legacy is from my ancestors. They were the founders of the World Spiritist Technique Sect,&rdquo; Yue Ling replied.<br>&ldquo;Your ancestors?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor, you have never heard of my ancestors before? How did you learn about the legacy here then?&rdquo; Yue Ling asked.<br>&ldquo;I heard that Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s legacy was here, so I came here to take a look,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor, who is the Lord Zhenlong you speak of?&rdquo; Yue Ling asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the legendary world spiritist who was once the First Guest Elder of the Totem Dragon Clan. He made many contributions to the Totem Dragon Clan, and the True Dragon Starfield was named after him,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Ah, I remember him now. That&rsquo;s interesting. My father has never told me that Lord Zhenlong has been here,&rdquo; Yue Ling said.<br>&ldquo;Is it possible that Lord Zhenlong sneaked in here? That might be why your ancestors weren&rsquo;t aware of it,&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible. The barrier was constructed in a way that allows only those with our bloodline to enter this forbidden land. If Lord Zhenlong had been here, my ancestors would have surely known about it,&rdquo; Yue Ling replied.<br>&ldquo;I see. Would it be right to say that your clan is the real master of this sect?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it.&rdquo; Yue Ling shook her head. &ldquo;The current sectmaster of the World Spiritist Technique Sect isn&rsquo;t my clan member.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting confused. You said that this sect was founded by your ancestors, and only those with your bloodline are allowed to enter this forbidden land. Why would the sectmaster not be one of your clan members then?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Yue Ling quickly explained the matter to Chu Feng.<br>According to her, she had an ancestor named Yue Chengkong, who was an incredible person in the Totem Galaxy back in his era. His reputation exceeded even that of Lord Zhenlong. In comparison, the World Spiritist Technique Sect wasn&rsquo;t as famous. In fact, hardly anyone knew that Yue Chengkong was the founder of the sect.<br>That was because Yue Chengkong founded the sect when he was still weak. Shortly after establishing the sect, he wanted to venture out into the world of cultivation and challenge himself. Thus, he passed down the sectmaster position to one of his good friends, Zhao Xuzhi.<br>The World Spiritist Technique Sect slowly grew in reputation under Zhao Xuzhi&rsquo;s management. Most people believed that the founder of the sect was Zhao Xuzhi instead of Yue Chengkong.<br>Yue Chengkong had also never told anyone that he was the founder of the World Spiritist Technique Sect, so no one knew that he had left his legacy there. In fact, the only one who knew about the matter was Zhao Xuzhi.<br>The succeeding sectmasters were all oblivious to the matter.<br>Thanks to that, the World Spiritist Technique Sect remained undisturbed by outsiders. Otherwise, with Yue Chengkong&rsquo;s reputation, experts of the Totem Galaxy would have come to the World Spiritist Technique Sect in search of his legacy, including the Totem Dragon Clan.<br>&ldquo;But surely the others know that you&rsquo;re able to enter the forbidden land?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng recalled how Yue Ling had openly walked into the forbidden land earlier, not to mention that there were many cultivators stronger than her in the sect. It was impossible for her to keep this matter hidden from the others.<br>&ldquo;They know that I&rsquo;m able to enter the forbidden land, but I told them that I don&rsquo;t know the reason behind it either,&rdquo; Yue Ling replied.<br>&ldquo;How surprising. You&rsquo;re capable of lying too?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile.<br>He thought that someone as innocent as Yue Ling wouldn&rsquo;t be able to lie.<br>&ldquo;Benefactor, I didn&rsquo;t want to lie either. My father told me that this is a teaching from our ancestors. He said that we might lose our legacy if word were to spread. I had no other choice,&rdquo; Yue Ling said with an aggrieved look on her face, almost as if she was worried that Chu Feng would think that she was a bad woman.<br>&ldquo;Of course. It&rsquo;s only right for you to follow your ancestor&rsquo;s teaching. Where&rsquo;s your father? Is he in the sect too?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t. To tell you the truth, our clan members have been sneaking in here for many generations. Our father grew up outside. In my younger years, I followed my parents to many different places. However, an accident occurred and my mother died saving my father. My father blamed himself for it. He buried my mother in this land and decided to leave me here. That was how I became a disciple of the World Spiritist Technique Sect,&rdquo; Yue Ling replied.<br>Chu Feng finally understood why Yue Ling said that the graves in the bamboo forest belonged to her ancestors. Given that only those of her bloodline were able to enter this place, the ones who were buried here were bound to be closely related to their clan.<br>&ldquo;Does your father return often to visit you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t. I have never seen him ever since he left me here. No one from the World Spiritist Technique Sect has met my father either. They all think that I&rsquo;m an orphan,&rdquo; Yue Ling replied.<br></p></div>
