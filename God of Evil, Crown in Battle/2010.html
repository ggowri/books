        <div> - Vomiting Blood From Anger<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Although they felt extremely displeased, they had no choice but to comply. As such, they added the names of their Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace to the certificates of indebtedness.<br>With that, it was no longer they who owed Chu Feng. Instead, it was the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace that owed Chu Feng. As long as the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace remained, they had to pay the debt.<br>&ldquo;Heavenly Law Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master, while it is true that the Mortal King Palace doesn&rsquo;t have any more Imperial Armaments, don&rsquo;t you have one in your hand?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why are you not handing that over?&rdquo; said Chu Feng as he looked to the Heavenly Law Palace Palace Master&rsquo;s Imperial Armament.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, I still need this Imperial Armament. Would you mind waiting until later when I find another Imperial Armament to hand to you?&rdquo; The Heavenly Law Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master pleaded. He was truly reluctant to part with his Imperial Armament.<br>After all, Imperial Armaments possessed awareness. As he had used that Imperial Armament for so long, he already gained feelings for it.<br>&ldquo;To refuse to hand over an Imperial Armament when you have one, what sort of logic is that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone, tell me, isn&rsquo;t this considered a refusal to pay one&rsquo;s debt?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a loud voice.<br>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; The crowd responded in unison.<br>&ldquo;Heavenly Law Palace Palace Master, I have heard of a phrase. Refusal to pay one&rsquo;s debt, your anus faces the south. Refusal to return one&rsquo;s money, your anus faces the north.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Which side do you plan to have your anus face?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I-I-I-I&rsquo;ll give it to you&rdquo; The Heavenly Law Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master started to shiver with anger. Without saying anything further, he immediately severed his relationship with his Imperial Armament and tossed it to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>After that, the Heavenly Law Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master vomited out a mouthful of blood. This was not only caused by his injuries from the connection with his Imperial Armament being severed, but rather, it was mainly because of his anger.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; After that, the Heavenly Law Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master turned to leave.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; However, Chu Feng spoke to stop him once again.<br>&ldquo;What else do you want? I have compensated you with all that I can and written you a certificate of indebtedness for what I cannot compensate. What else do you want from me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If that is still not enough, you might as well just kill us!&rdquo; The Heavenly Law Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master shouted in a very displeased manner.<br>Even his last bits of patience had been grinded off by Chu Feng. Chu Feng was truly too ruthless. Although Chu Feng did not kill any of them, he had snatched away all of their most valuable Imperial Armaments. Furthermore, he had left them with an enormous debt.<br>Although their Heavenly Law Palace had escaped from extermination, they had been completely curbed by Chu Feng. At that moment, Duanmu Feiyu felt as if he wished he was dead.<br>&ldquo;You all still haven&rsquo;t handed over the Wood Immortal Profound Technique and the Gold Immortal Profound Technique,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;What? Hand over the Wood Immortal Profound Technique and the Gold Immortal Profound Technique? Chu Feng, what kind of joke is this? You did not mention those two in the compensation that you wanted earlier,&rdquo; The two Palace Masters said in unison.<br>The Three Palaces had existed for a very long time. Apart from Imperial Armaments, their most precious possessions were the three Supreme Secret Skills that they possessed.<br>They were already extremely unwilling to hand over the Imperial Armaments. And now, Chu Feng wanted them to hand over their Supreme Secret Skills too? How could they possibly be willing to agree to it? Furthermore, Chu Feng had indeed not mentioned any secret skills in the compensation he had requested before.<br>Thus, they would definitely not hand over their secret skills. The reason for that was because Chu Feng was the one being unreasonable here. Even if they were to dispute with him, even if they were to find people to determine who was wrong, they would not be afraid of Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, I did not mention it in the compensation earlier. However, they were clearly written on your certificates of indebtedness.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Everyone, have a look, have a look. See and judge for yourselves,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he took out the two certificates of indebtedness that the two Palace Masters had signed. Using his world spirit techniques, he had enlarged the words written on them. As such, everyone was able to see their contents.<br>After carefully reading the two certificates of indebtedness, the crowd was shocked to discover that, sure enough, there was a clause stating that the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace could use their Wood Immortal Profound Technique and Gold Immortal Profound Technique as a replacement for two weapons. However, they had to hand over the two secret skills to Chu Feng on the spot. Otherwise, they would be breaching the contract.<br>However, the matter that caused the crowd to not know whether to laugh or cry was that it was written on the contract that the two weapons that the two secret skills could replace were not Imperial Armaments, but rather Incomplete Imperial Armaments.<br>In other words, both the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace could give Chu Feng one less Incomplete Imperial Armament. However, they must use their Supreme Secret Skills as a replacement.<br>It would be one thing if they were to replace Imperial Armaments. However, they were actually only able to replace Incomplete Imperial Armaments. This caused the people from the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace to become completely speechless.<br>&ldquo;Bastard, Chu Feng, you are simply scamming people here!&rdquo; The Heavenly Law Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master felt as if he was going be angered to death by Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, your actions are simply unreasonable!&rdquo; The Mortal King Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master was shivering with anger.<br>Due to their carelessness, they had not carefully read over the so-called certificate of indebtedness. However, they had not expected Chu Feng to scam them like this.<br>&ldquo;Ah? Scam? This condition was clearly written on the certificates of indebtedness before the two of you signed them. It was your mistake to not carefully read them over. Yet now, you are actually blaming me for it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lord Luokong, Lord Lianghua, please preside over this matter. How could they refuse to admit their debt?&rdquo; Chu Feng looked to the two Ancient Era&rsquo;s Elves&rsquo; Grand Elders.<br>&ldquo;We should not spare the lives of vile and lowly characters who refuse to recognize their losses,&rdquo; Lord Lianghua said with a cold voice.<br>&ldquo;The two of you should just admit to what you&rsquo;ve signed. After all, little friend Chu Feng is already extremely tolerant to be willing to spare your lives,&rdquo; Lord Luokong added.<br>&ldquo;But, the secret skills&rsquo; original owners are already dead. Right now&hellip;&rdquo; The Heavenly Law Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master wanted to provide an excuse.<br>&ldquo;Although I do not know who the previous owners of the two secret skills are, if my guess is correct, the two secret skills should be with the two Palace Masters, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is best that you two do not deny it. Else, I have the means to make your secret skills reveal themselves. At that time, it would be extremely embarrassing for you all,&rdquo; Chu Feng interrupted before the Heavenly Law Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master could finish.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo; Hearing those words, the faces of the two Palace Masters immediately turned ashen. Chu Feng had hit the bullseye. The two secret skills were indeed with them right now.<br>&ldquo;Hand them over. Although your bodies might suffer some damage from a forced removal of the secret skills, you can have confidence in my world spirit techniques.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am able to make it so that the two of you will suffer the least amount of damage from the removing of the secret skills,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;Take them,&rdquo; The two Palace Masters said while gnashing their teeth. Today, they had truly suffered at the hands of Chu Feng.<br>Afterward, Chu Feng began to set up a spirit formation on the spot and removed the two secret skills from the two Palace Masters&rsquo; bodies.<br>Merely, after the two secret skills were removed, the two Palace Masters&rsquo; bodies started to tremble uncontrollably. Their complexions turned blue, and their lips turned green. They needed to be supported, or else they would not be able to even stand.<br>At that moment, the two men&rsquo;s vitality were deeply injured. Likely, they would not be able to recover in a short period of time.<br>Seeing that scene, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, the Immeasurable Immortal, the Snow-haired Immortal and Zhang Ming, these Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists, all started to snicker up their sleeves.<br>They who were proficient with World Spirit Techniques all knew that it was not impossible to remove secret skills from one&rsquo;s body. Mainly, it would depend on the strength of one&rsquo;s world spirit techniques.<br>Actually, with their abilities as Dragon mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists, all of them were capable of accomplishing that.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng&rsquo;s mastery of World Spirit Techniques surpassed their own. Thus, even if  the two Palace Masters were to be injured from the removal of the secret techniques, they should not be injured to such a degree. In fact, even if they were to be the ones removing the secret skills, the two Palace Masters would not have been injured to such a degree.<br>Yet now, the two Palace Masters had been so deeply injured. It was clear that there was only a single possibility as to why; Chu Feng had made a fool of them.<br><br></p></div>
