        <div> - Reincarnation Sect<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I am truly sorry. Once again, I&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Even though Chu Feng felt ashamed, he knew that he had to confront it.<br>Thus, he told the Mystic Cave Saints everything.<br>He included how he had encountered the fox spirit, and how he had obtained the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip. He told the Mystic Cave Saints everything.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, that is a good thing. Why are you apologizing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right. You&rsquo;ve managed to obtain such a precious treasure. At least, this trip has been worthwhile.&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints not only did not blame Chu Feng upon learning about the course of events, but they were instead smiling brilliantly.<br>&ldquo;Whether it be that Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb or this stone case, it is you all who told me about them. If you hadn't brought me to them, if you hadn&rsquo;t worked together with me, I would not have been able to obtain such a harvest from either place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb, I received the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s inheritance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In the stone case world, I obtained the precious God Bestowment Bamboo Slip.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Most importantly, I alone enjoyed the benefits of both items. I am truly&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng still felt very ashamed. At the same time, he took out all the treasures he had obtained from the fox spirit and handed them to the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, these are all precious treasures. Are you really planning to give them all to us?&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints were all wild with joy upon seeing the treasures Chu Feng had taken out.<br>They did not seem to be faking their joy. Instead, they were truly delighted.<br>&ldquo;These are not enough. At least, when compared to what I&rsquo;ve obtained, what you all obtained cannot compare at all,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Asura, you can&rsquo;t say it like that. Although it is us who informed you about the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb and that Ancient Era&rsquo;s stone case, you&rsquo;ve obtained both the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s inheritance and that God Bestowment Bamboo Slip with your own ability.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We brothers were simply unable to obtain the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s inheritance.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Likewise, even if we were the ones to enter the stone world, we would not be able to even pass through that sea of lightning. Not to mention obtaining the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip, we wouldn&rsquo;t even have been able to obtain any of the treasures here right now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In truth, it is us brothers who took advantage of brother Asura,&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;What my big brother said is very correct. Brother Asura, in terms of owing someone, it is us brothers who owe you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even in terms of feeling apologetic, it should be us brothers who feel apologetic toward brother Asura,&rdquo; the Eleventh of the Mystic Cave Saints said with a beaming smile on his face.<br>Seeing the Mystic Cave Saints acting like that, Chu Feng felt even more ashamed.<br>If the Mystic Cave Saints were to make a fuss about it, then Chu Feng might not feel so ashamed.<br>However, the Mystic Cave Saints, even though they were people who viewed treasures as equal to their lives, did not bicker over the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip in the slightest. Instead, they were acting very magnanimously.<br>Most importantly, they were not pretending.<br>The more they acted like that, the more Chu Feng felt that he had let them down.<br>Chu Feng felt that the Mystic Cave Saints were truly rare friends. He wanted to treasure his friendship with them.<br>That said, Chu Feng was not someone who kept track of records.<br>Since it was impossible to change things now at that moment, he decided to no longer burden himself with the matter.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, I will no longer linger on this either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if you all need my help with anything, do not hesitate to tell me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The next time, I, Asura, will help you all for free,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;No, that wouldn&rsquo;t do. We must share our profits normally. Furthermore, I&rsquo;ll be blunt with you, if brother Asura still needs to be the person to take on the most risk, you shall obtain the greatest share of the profits.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re using your life to find meat to eat. We are more than satisfied to be able to freeload some soup from you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We must share our profits fairly. If you are to put forth more work than us, you should naturally receive a greater share of the profits.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whilst we Mystic Cave Saints are people that will act a bit unscrupulously towards outsiders, we are people who must uphold fairness towards our own brothers,&rdquo; the Mystic Cave Saints said in succession.<br>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;<br>With the Mystic Cave Saints acting like that, what could Chu Feng possibly say?<br>As such, he smiled and nodded to them.<br>&ldquo;Hm? It seems like there&rsquo;s movement on the other side.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the Third of the Mystic Cave Saints pointed to the spirit formation gate.<br>The spirit formation gate was like a mirror at that moment. Furthermore, the mirror was very large. It was capable of seeing the situation on the other side completely.<br>Hearing the words of the Mystic Cave Saints&rsquo; Third, Chu Feng and the others all turned their gazes over to the spirit formation gate.<br>They had originally thought that a conflict had arisen between the All-heaven Sect and the five great powers over disagreements in compensation.<br>However, once they looked to the spirit formation gate, their expressions, especially Chu Feng&rsquo;s, all turned to ones of shock.<br>It turned out that an uninvited guest had charged into that place.<br>It was a red war chariot. That war chariot was not very large, yet it was very exquisite.<br>It was actually pulled by thirty-seven spirit beasts. Flying through the air, the war chariot appeared very impressive.<br>There was a person at the front of the war chariot. Chu Feng recognized that person.<br>She was the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster, Han Xiu.<br>Her gaze was ice-cold and filled with hostility. She did not seem like she was there to participate in the grand occasion. Instead, it seemed like she was there to obtain revenge.<br>Because of how hostile her aura was, she immediately caught the crowd&rsquo;s attention the moment she appeared.<br>However, if that were all, Chu Feng would not have been so shocked.<br>The reason why Chu Feng was so shocked was because of the banner on the war chariot.<br>The banner drifted in the wind, producing flapping sounds nonstop.<br>On the banner was not the name of the Red-dress Holy Land.<br>Rather, it was&hellip; Reincarnation Sect!<br>&ldquo;Reincarnation Sect?&rdquo;<br>An enormous wave immediately rose in Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart the moment he saw those words.<br>Those words made him recall some things.<br>&ldquo;Reincarnation Sect?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Han Xiu is the headmaster of the Red-dress Holy Land. Why would she be flying the banner of the Reincarnation Sect?&rdquo;<br>The crowd present immediately entered a spirited discussion upon seeing the banner of the Reincarnation Sect.<br>Perhaps the people from the five great powers might not recognize Han Xiu.<br>However, the great majority of the people present were from the All-heaven Starfield.<br>Not only did they know about Han Xiu, but they also knew about the Reincarnation Sect.<br>What was the Reincarnation Sect?<br>That explanation would have to begin many years before.<br>The Reincarnation Sect was from the Reincarnation Upper Realm.<br>Back then, the Reincarnation Sect was extremely renowned throughout the entire All-heaven Starfield.<br>They were extremely powerful, so powerful that they threatened the overlord status of the All-heaven Sect.<br>As such, during the flourishing age of the Reincarnation Sect, they were the fully-deserving overlord of the Reincarnation Upper Realm.<br>At that time, the Red-dress Holy Land did not exist.<br>With the rise in power of the Reincarnation Sect, the All-heaven Sect realized their ambition.<br>Yet, as the Reincarnation Sect was a power belonging to the All-heaven Starfield, the All-heaven Sect did not wish to massacre them.<br>As such, they dispatched their then strongest genius Liu Shuo to ask for marriage with the daughter of the Reincarnation Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>Unfortunately, the Reincarnation Sect&rsquo;s ambition was too strong. On the day of the marriage, they tried to kill Liu Shuo.<br>Unfortunately for them, the All-heaven Sect had been on guard against it.<br>After the Reincarnation Sect began their attempted assassination, the All-heaven Sect had no choice but to wage war against the Reincarnation Sect.<br>As for the outcome, it was naturally the All-heaven Sect that won.<br>Since that day, the Reincarnation Sect had completely disappeared from the All-heaven Starfield.<br>It was worthy of mentioning that the current sectmaster of the All-heaven Sect was none other than Liu Shuo, the exceptional genius who was to marry the daughter of the Reincarnation Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>Liu Shuo was actually so exceptional back then that he was deemed to be a genius capable of altering the structure of the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>Unfortunately, in the battle against the Reincarnation Sect, he had suffered serious injuries and had nearly died.<br>Whilst he'd managed to survive his injuries, his exceptional genius had been forever ruined.<br>Although the All-heaven Sect had managed to emerge victorious in the battle back then, they&rsquo;d forfeited Liu Shuo&rsquo;s future prospects.<br>Because of that, Liu Shuo had a bone-deep hatred for the Reincarnation Sect.<br>Even though the Reincarnation Sect had been purged for many years, no one dared mention them again.<br>Although everyone knew what had happened to the Reincarnation Sect, they had already become a taboo in the All-heaven Starfield.<br>If anyone dared mention the Reincarnation Sect, they would&rsquo;ve simply committed a capital offense.<br>Yet at that moment, the Red-dress Holy Land&rsquo;s headmaster Han Xiu had not only arrived there aggressively, but her war chariot was actually flying the banner of the Reincarnation Sect.<br>Furthermore, that banner was filled with an ancient aura.<br>It did not resemble a newly-made banner.<br>Rather, it seemed like a banner that had been left behind from the Reincarnation Sect of the past.<br>Why would Han Xiu preserve a Reincarnation Sect banner?<br>Although the crowd did not know the concrete details, they knew that her actions and behavior indicated that she had come with ill intentions.<br></p></div>
