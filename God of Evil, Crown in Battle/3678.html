        <h1>Chapter 3677</h1>
        <div> - Blood-devouring Hall<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, before the crusaders could approach, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s protective formation suddenly disappeared.<br>The sudden disappearance of the protective formation not only confused the crowd, but it also confused the crusaders.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>In the next moment, a very powerful aura swept out from the Chu Heavenly Clan like a tide. In an instant, it completely enveloped the crusaders who had come to challenge the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>As the power of that aura was simply too strong, the army of over ten thousand were all caught in the tide like fallen leaves. Powerless, they could only allow the tide to carry them along.<br>That oppressive might was a peak Exalted-level oppressive might.<br>When the attack from the oppressive might had disappeared, the army of over ten thousand were pushed several tens of thousands of meters away. More or less, all of the crusaders were injured, and left in a very sorry state.<br>Even that Blackwind Old Man was lying on the floor, completely battered.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The crusaders were all afraid and panicking. As for the bystanders, they were completely confused.<br>Those crusaders were no ordinary mob.<br>The great majority of them were Exalted-level experts. Several among them were even rank eight Exalted.<br>In the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they would definitely be unequalled with their cultivations.<br>The crowd felt that an army of experts like theirs should be capable of defeating any power in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. They felt that not even the Chu Heavenly Clan could be an exception.<br>In fact, even if the Chu Heavenly Clan joined hands with all the other powers in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, they would still be no match for those people.<br>Yet, at that moment, all the experts that were crusading against the Chu Heavenly Clan were defeated by mere oppressive might. Naturally, this greatly shocked the crowd.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an expert in the Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>This was what the majority of the crowd were thinking.<br>At that moment, the crowd all turned their gazes to the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Sure enough, a figure appeared before the crowd&rsquo;s view.<br>The powerful peak Exalted-level oppressive might was being emitted from that person.<br>&ldquo;Heavens, isn&rsquo;t that&hellip;?&rdquo;<br>When the crowd saw who that person was, many people dropped their jaws in shock. They simply did not dare to believe their eyes.<br>The reason for that was because that person was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>Although the crowd were feeling disbelief, the peak Exalted-level aura was being emitted by none other than the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>With this, even if the crowd did not wish to accept it, they had no choice but to accept it.<br>&ldquo;The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief actually became a peak Exalted?&rdquo;<br>Shock filled the faces of many of the people present. This was especially true for the crusaders that were there to suppress the Chu Heavenly Clan. They were shivering in fear, and their faces had turned ashen.<br>Wasn&rsquo;t he a rank five Exalted before?<br>Wasn&rsquo;t he supposed to be easily defeated?<br>This was completely different from the intelligence they had.<br>&ldquo;Milord, could it be that you already knew that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was a peak Exalted? Is that why you said those people would not be a match for the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo;<br>Astonished, the people that were ridiculing that expert from the Ghost Sect Hall earlier now turned their gazes to him.<br>At that moment, they were no longer looking at that Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s expert like he was a fool.<br>Instead, they were looking at him like he was an expert of extraordinary status. Admiration and respect filled their eyes.<br>&ldquo;Actually, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief has been a peak Exalted for some time now. He was merely deliberately concealing that fact so that no one would know about it," that Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s expert said.<br>&ldquo;Why did he bother to conceal his cultivation? Wouldn&rsquo;t he be able to deter everyone should he reveal it directly? If he did that, what happened here today wouldn&rsquo;t have happened.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Practically no clan chief has ever concealed their cultivation to outsiders. Instead, they will immediately announce to the world when their cultivation increases so as to deter others. Why would the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief decide to conceal his cultivation instead?&rdquo;<br>Whilst exclaiming in admiration toward the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s cultivation, the crowd were also confused by why he had decided to do such a thing.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as you all said. If the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had announced his cultivation, those people would not have appeared here today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if those people didn&rsquo;t show up here today, how could the Chu Heavenly Clan know that they held resentment toward them?&rdquo; said the Ghost Sect Hall&rsquo;s expert.<br>&ldquo;If you say it like that, it is indeed reasonable.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the crowd that were feeling confused began to nod in agreement.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, how are we to take care of them?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Xuanzhengfa arrived beside the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Let them go,&rdquo; said the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;What? Let them go?&rdquo;<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa and the others from the Law Enforcement Hall all revealed confused expressions upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;In the past, perhaps because your relatives had been killed, or perhaps because of some other matter, you all had conflicts with Xuanyuan. However, Xuanyuan is no longer in this world. We should let the past be the past.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, I will not make things difficult for you all. You can leave.&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke with a loud voice. There was no trace of anger in his voice. Instead, his tone was one filled with helplessness.<br>The people that came to suppress the Chu Heavenly Clan simply did not dare to believe their ears, and were all stunned.<br>Since ancient times, powers would always rule with an iron fist.<br>People like them who went to another power with the intention to suppress them would be committing a grave offense toward the power they were trying to suppress.<br>If they were defeated by the power they were trying to suppress, even if they were kept alive, they would be severely punished to deter others from attempting the same.<br>Originally, when they learned that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s actual cultivation was that of a peak Exalted, they had thought that they were doomed.<br>Never would they have imagined that the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief actually wanted to spare them.<br>&ldquo;What are you all still staying here for?! Scram immediately! Do you insist on having me capture you?!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the crusaders were all stunned, many people from the Law Enforcement Hall began to shout at them angrily.<br>They actually were unable to understand the actions of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. They wanted to execute all those people that were there to stir up trouble.<br>They knew that if the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief didn&rsquo;t have the cultivation of a peak Exalted, if their Chu Heavenly Clan was really breached by those people, the people of their Chu Heavenly Clan would have met with a great disaster.<br>In fact, it might even have been possible for their Chu Heavenly Clan to be erased completely.<br>Those people would definitely not have shown mercy towards their Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Because of that, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were still filled with fury. If it wasn&rsquo;t for their Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s decision, they would really want to ruthlessly teach those people a lesson.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Clan Chief Chu, thank you, Clan Chief Chu.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crusaders did not dare to stay any longer. One by one, they dragged their miserable-looking bodies up and were preparing to leave.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Chu is truly impressive.&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, a voice was suddenly heard.<br>Hearing that voice, even the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief revealed a great change in expression.<br>The reason for that was because following the voice came eight auras.<br>Each of those auras belonged to a peak Exalted.<br>Soon, eight figures appeared out of thin air.<br>All of them were wearing crimson, blood-colored gowns. Not only were their gowns crimson, but they were also emitting an intense reek of blood. Those gowns were dyed crimson by blood.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s them?&rdquo;<br>Seeing the eight people, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen, the bystanders, and even the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief started to frown.<br>Apart from the various major powers, there was also a terrifying and dark power in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.<br>The people of that power all wore crimson blood-dyed gowns. They specialized in the shady business of killing others.<br>Practically no one targeted by them was able to live.<br>They were the infamous organization of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&hellip; the Blood-devouring Hall!!!<br></p></div>
