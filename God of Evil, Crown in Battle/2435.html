        <div> - A Nightmare<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Eggy, what do I do? My body!!!&rdquo; Chu Feng felt that his body was about to be seized. Helpless, he turned to request Her Lady Queen for help.<br>&ldquo;Never did I expect this Demon Armament to be so powerful. I have already thought of a way to help you seize your body back. But&hellip; it has sealed off your world spirit space, making it impossible for me to get out to help you,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that my body is really going to be seized by this thing?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng felt very helpless and pained.<br>He was gradually losing control over his body. This caused Chu Feng to recall Su Rou and Su Mei.<br>Su Rou and Su Mei had had their bodies seized by the Moon Immortal.<br>And now, it seemed he would also have his body seized by the Evil God Sword. Thus, at that moment, he was able to feel the suffering that Su Rou and Su Mei experienced when their bodies were seized.<br>However, the Moon Immortal was different from the Evil God Sword. The Moon Immortal said that she had something that she needed to do, and she would only be temporarily borrowing Su Rou and Su Mei&rsquo;s bodies.<br>However, the Evil God Sword was different. If Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was to really be seized by the Evil God Sword, a great demon would emerge in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm and openly slaughter the innocent.<br>Thinking about that, Chu Feng began to gather up his spirit. He planned to take back his body.<br>&ldquo;Tsk, tsk, tsk. It&rsquo;s useless. What could you possibly contend against me with?&rdquo; The Evil God Sword let out a mocking laugh.<br>Although Chu Feng was angered by that mockery, he was indeed powerless to contend against the Evil God Sword.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, a strange aura was suddenly emitted from Chu Feng&rsquo;s dantian and spread through Chu Feng&rsquo;s body.<br>&ldquo;Ahh!!!&rdquo; The next moment, Chu Feng let out an incomparably painful shout.<br>That voice was not only let out by Chu Feng, it was also let out by the Evil God Sword. At that moment, both Chu Feng and the Evil God Sword were enduring extreme pain.<br>That strange aura had indeed come from Chu Feng&rsquo;s dantian. However, it was unrelated to Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heavenly Bloodline.<br>It was a bamboo slip. The bamboo slip was dark gold in color, and emitting a very ancient aura. Furthermore, it contained an air of absolute supremacy.<br>It was that bamboo slip that brought such suffering to Chu Feng.<br>Under the unbearable pain, Chu Feng gradually felt that he seemed to have regained control of his body.<br>Merely, his mind was no longer clear. At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s awareness started to grow indistinct.<br>However, he was able to sense that his body was still moving. Merely, he had no idea where he was moving toward.<br>Muddleheaded, Chu Feng felt that a long time had passed. However, he had no idea as to exactly how long it was.<br>His mind was in absolute chaos. The only thing he knew was that he had been flying in the sky the entire time this was happening. Furthermore, he seemed to be holding the Evil God Sword in his hand too.<br>&hellip;...<br>Still muddleheaded, Chu Feng opened his eyes, and was shocked to discover that he was lying in a forest.<br>The sun shone brightly here. There were singing birds and fragrant flowers. His surroundings, including even the sky, all seemed very familiar.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&rsquo;ve woken up.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a sweet-sounding voice sounded beside Chu Feng&rsquo;s ear. Turning toward the voice, Chu Feng saw that a young woman was standing beside him with her hands behind her back. She was looking at him with a smile on her face.<br>That young woman was exceptionally beautiful. Especially when she laughed; it was an incomparably brilliant sight filled with brightness.<br>It was truly enchanting.<br>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; Mei?&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing that young woman, Chu Feng stood up excitedly and immediately embraced her.<br>The reason for that was because the young woman before him was none other than the lover that he yearned for day and night, Su Mei.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Why did you appear to have gone stupid after waking up from your sleep?&rdquo; Su Mei said in surprise. Her face turned red.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what are you doing to my little sister?&rdquo; Right at that moment, a stern voice sounded from nearby.<br>That voice was so resounding that the birds in the forest were frightened, and flew away.<br>Turning toward the voice, Chu feng discovered that there was another woman standing nearby.<br>As for that woman, she possessed an alluring build and emitted a threatening air. It was Su Rou.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let go of my little sister!&rdquo; Su Rou pointed at Chu Feng and shouted angrily.<br>&ldquo;This is truly great! Both of you are here!&rdquo; Chu Feng let go of Su Mei and rushed toward Su Rou, embracing her tightly.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what are you doing? You are truly presumptuous! You dare act this rude toward me?!&rdquo; Su Rou flew into a rage out of humiliation. She immediately pushed Chu Feng aside.<br>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; Rou, what&rsquo;s happened to you?&rdquo; Chu Feng was very surprised. He did not understand why Su Rou was so emotional.<br>&ldquo;Haha, big sister, don&rsquo;t bother pretending anymore. I know that you also like Chu Feng,&rdquo; Su Mei burst into a laughter.<br>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; Mei, you shut up. What sort of nonsense are you spouting?&rdquo; Su Rou&rsquo;s face turned red like an apple. This caused her alluring face to grow cuter, making her even more attractive.<br>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like Chu Feng, why did you turn red?&rdquo; Su Mei said.<br>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Su Rou&rsquo;s face grew more and more red. Then, she stormed off in a huff. She was really angry.<br>&ldquo;Big sister, don&rsquo;t be angry. I was only joking around with you,&rdquo; Su Mei ran after Su Rou while hopping and bouncing.<br>In response, Chu Feng also wanted to follow after them. However, he was surprised to discover that he was unable to move.<br>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; Rou, Lil&rsquo; Mei, wait for me!!!&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly shouted.<br>However, Su Rou and Su Mei acted as if they could not hear him and soon disappeared from his line of sight.<br>As Su Rou and Su Mei gradually grew further and further away, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes turned pitch-black. The only thing he could hear were the angry footsteps of Su Rou and the sweet-sounding laughter of Su Mei.<br>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; Rou, Lil&rsquo; Mei!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng got back up.<br>At that moment, he was still sitting inside a forest. Merely, that forest was completely different from the forest earlier.<br>This was simply a different place.<br>&ldquo;It was a dream. What happened earlier was a dream. What a realistic dream.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng came to a sudden realization. The scene earlier had taken place in the Azure Dragon School&rsquo;s forest. It was when Su Mei was still only a young woman, when Su Rou was still an elder of the Azure Dragon School, and when neither of them were his lovers.<br>It had indeed been a dream. Merely, that dream had been too life-like. It had been so realistic that it came like a sharp blade that pierced through Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng felt pain all over his body. It was as if his body was being torn apart. That sort of pain was very unbearable.<br>However, the pain he felt on his body was far inferior to the pain he felt in his heart.<br>It was the pain from longing for Su Rou and Su Mei, as well as the guilt he felt toward them.<br>At that moment when Chu Feng was feeling sentimental, he suddenly discovered that he was holding onto the Evil God Sword with his right hand.<br>He suddenly recalled what had happened earlier.<br>He clearly remembered that the Evil God Sword had nearly seized his body.<br>Recalling that, Chu Feng immediately tossed the Evil God Sword away.<br>Then, he turned his consciousness toward his world spirit space. He wanted to see how Her Lady Queen was doing.<br>However, he was shocked to discover that he was actually unable to enter his world spirit space, and could not sense the situation inside his world spirit space.<br>It was as if his world spirit space had disappeared from his body.<br><br></p></div>
