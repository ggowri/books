        <h1>Chapter 4313</h1>
        <div> - Such Acknowledgement<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What must one do to enter the ninth galaxy?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, it is too early for you to be curious about that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is not too late to learn about it later on. Besides, for some things, isn&rsquo;t it much more enjoyable for one to seek out the answers on one&rsquo;s own?&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Indeed, what brother Shaoyu said is correct,&rdquo; Chu Feng smiled.<br>Chu Feng agreed to what Xianhai Shaoyu said.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s nothing that can be said about your talent. I&rsquo;m not trying to pour cold water over your head. But, the path that you would have to take is still very long.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is especially true if you continued to slowly train in a place like this Holy Light Galaxy. The speed of your progress will become even slower.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;While a person&rsquo;s talent is very important, cultivation resources inevitably determine how far a martial cultivation could reach. If you continue to train here, you will only be wasting your time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, if you&rsquo;re willing, I can provide you with a shortcut,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, what is that shortcut you spoke of?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>While Chu Feng was not fond of owing others debt and prefers to rely on himself, he was in a rush to become stronger.<br>If Xianhai Shaoyu could provide him with a shortcut, Chu Feng might not refuse it.<br>&ldquo;My father possess some relationship with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I can recommend you to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Of course&hellip; it&rsquo;s not easy to officially join the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, you&rsquo;ll have to pass through their tests in order to join them.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The testing period is between three and ten years. During that period, if you are able to pass their tests, you will be able to enter the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion to officially become a member and enjoy all the associated benefits.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, should you decide to take the test, with the exception of passing or failing, you are not allowed to leave the testing region without their permission.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, with how talented brother Chu Feng is, there&rsquo;s simply no need for ten years. I am certain that you will be able to pass their test in three years,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Thank you brother Shaoyu for your good intentions. Unfortunately, I have matters that I must handle here and cannot leave the Holy Light Galaxy for the time being,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>Ignoring the fact that Chu Feng was urgent to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to save Zi Ling and couldn&rsquo;t delay that matter by three long years, merely by the fact that Chu Feng already viewed the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion as enemies in his heart, how could Chu Feng possibly join them?<br>How could he lower his head to the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion that had imprisoned his mother and was pursuing him and his father with the intention of killing them?<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, what urgent matter do you have?&rdquo; asked Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>Xianhai Shaoyu does not know about Chu Feng&rsquo;s relationship with the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion. Thus, he only wanted to know why Chu Feng was willing to give up on this rare opportunity.<br>After all, an opportunity like that was something that countless people yearned for in their dreams.<br>&ldquo;I have someone that I needed to protect,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Sigh. If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll just tell you the truth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Demon Morph Clan came to the Holy Light Galaxy for the sake of finding something.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In order to find what they seek, they will do anything. Even if they have to overturn the entire Holy Light Galaxy and bring about a calamity upon everyone in it, they will hesitate to do so.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Of course, that is something my fourth uncle said. His words might not necessarily be trustworthy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, I am afraid that what he told me is the truth. If it is the truth, the current Holy Light Galaxy is extremely dangerous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, brother Chu Feng, you should leave with me. You should leave this place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With your talent, your future is most definitely unbounded. There is no reason for you to stay here and take on such dangers,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Brother Shaoyu, I thank you for your kind intentions. But, aren&rsquo;t cultivators facing dangers of death every day?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If the people of the Holy Light Galaxy are destined to be met with a calamity, I am even more obligated to stay here and fight alongside the seniors of this place. After all, no matter how weak this Holy Light Galaxy is, it is still my home,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;It would appear that I will not be able to persuade you,&rdquo; Xianhai Shaoyu had sensed Chu Feng&rsquo;s determination to not leave.<br>Afterwards, the two of them left the starry sky and returned to where Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er and Xianhai Gusu were waiting.<br>Seeing Chu Feng and Xianhai Shaoyu had returned safely, Xianhai Gusu heaved a sigh of relief.<br>Then, they chatted for a while.<br>Chu Feng knew that Xianhai Shaoyu and them had finished what they were here to do and were preparing to leave the Holy Light Galaxy to return to their clan.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, the next time we meet, it&rsquo;ll definitely not be on this Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will wait for the day when your name, Chu Feng, resonates throughout the martial cultivation world,&rdquo; Xianhai Shaoyu said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;We will definitely meet again,&rdquo; Chu Feng was also filled with confidence.<br>Even though Chu Feng was still very weak, so much that he would be considered to be weak even in the Holy Light Galaxy,<br>If he was placed in the entire galaxy, then the current Chu Feng would still be a nobody.<br>But, Chu Feng knew that he would one day be able to play a role in this vast martial cultivation world filled with experts.<br>Else, he would not be worthy of being the son of Chu Xuanyuan and Jie Ranqing.<br>&ldquo;In that case, I will wait for you to come to our Immortal Sea Fish Clan to marry my little sister,&rdquo; said Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>Once Xianhai Shaoyu said those words, the expressions of Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er and Xianhai Gusu changed.<br>While they didn&rsquo;t say anything, they were looking at Xianhai Shaoyu with shock-filled eyes.<br>They both knew who the little sister Xianhai Shaoyu mentioned was.<br>While the current Immortal Sea Fish Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had quite many children, Xianhai Shaoyu only considered a single one of his siblings as his actual sibling.<br>That would be his younger sister of the same mother and father, Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er.<br>But, what was Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er?<br>Xianhai Shaoyu was the strongest person of the younger generation in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan. His talent and strength was so powerful that he was already renowned throughout the martial cultivation world.<br>He was publicly accepted to be one of the strongest people of the current younger generations.<br>But, Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s talent was even more terrifying than Xianhai Shaoyu. It was very possible that her future accomplishments would surpass Xianhai Shaoyu.<br>Due to her exceptional talent and delightful temperament, practically no one in the Immortal Sea Fish Clan dislikes Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er.<br>She was truly the pearl of the entire Immortal Sea Fish Clan.<br>As for Xianhai Shaoyu, he was someone who dotes on his younger sister a lot.<br>Should his sister want anything, even if it might be the stars in the sky, he would not hesitate to pick them out from the sky for her.<br>The people from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan all knew that Xianhai Shaoyu was a proud person. Apart from the people from the Immortal Sea Fish Clan, Xianhai Shaoyu only admires a single expert in the entire martial cultivation world -- the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion&rsquo;s Jie Ranqing.<br>While Xianhai Shaoyu had never met Jie Ranqing, his admiration for her had reached a state of idolization.<br>But, Xianhai Shaoyu had also mentioned something in the past...<br>If anyone could surpass Jie Ranqing, that person would be his younger sister Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er.<br>Since there was no one that could match Jie Ranqing in this world, there would naturally also not be anyone that could match his younger sister Xianhai Yu&rsquo;er.<br>Even though Xianhai Xin&rsquo;er and Xianhai Gusu already knew Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s intention to meet Chu Feng before they came to the Holy Light Galaxy...<br>Even though they knew that Xianhai Shaoyu had an excellent impression of Chu Feng after they met, it was so much that he was willing to brave dangers for Chu Feng, they did not expect for Xianhai Shaoyu&rsquo;s acknowledgement of Chu Feng to reach this degree.<br>He was actually willing to marry his younger sister to Chu Feng!<br></p></div>
