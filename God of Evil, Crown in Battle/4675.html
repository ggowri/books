        <h1>Chapter 4674</h1>
        <div>: Let&rsquo;s Call Her Yaoyao<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Daddy?&rdquo;<br>That word brought everyone&rsquo;s gazes to Chu Feng in an instant.<br>The Lady of Dao Sea still looked normal, but Eggy, Yu Sha, and Wang Yuxian had a bizarre look in their eyes. They were all &lsquo;big sisters&rsquo;, so why would the address suddenly change when it got to Chu Feng?<br>&ldquo;Daddy, daddy! I want a hug!&rdquo;<br>The female baby called out to Chu Feng with her childlike voice as she stretched her hands toward him. It was truly adorable.<br>Even though the female baby was still young, such that her facial features had yet to fully develop, one could still see the makings of a beauty in her.<br>Faced with such a cute female baby, Chu Feng reached out and carried her over to his side.<br>Now that she was finally in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hands, the female baby looked extraordinarily excited. She seemed to be even happier than when she was in Eggy&rsquo;s embrace earlier.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s going on? When did you have a baby with the evil spirits in the Asura Graveyard?&rdquo;<br>Eggy placed her hands on her hips as she began interrogating him.<br>&ldquo;Milady Queen, don&rsquo;t talk nonsense. You said yourself that you could see everything that I did while you were in closed-door training. When had I ever gotten involved with an evil spirit?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng knew that Eggy was joking with him, but he still couldn&rsquo;t help but hurriedly clarify the misunderstanding.<br>&ldquo;Is it between you and Yu Sha then?&rdquo; Eggy pressed on.<br>&ldquo;Miss Queen, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Those words made Yu Sha&rsquo;s face flush red. A slight hint of rage and indignance surfaced in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Hahahaha, I&rsquo;m just joking. There&rsquo;s no need to take it so seriously!&rdquo;<br>Seeing how Yu Sha wasn&rsquo;t taking the joke too well, Eggy quickly laughed it off and explained that she was not being serious here.<br>&ldquo;Still, it&rsquo;s weird how this female baby is calling Chu Feng her father.&rdquo;<br>Wang Yuxian looked at the excited female baby in Chu Feng&rsquo;s arms as she remarked.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that simple? This female baby is no ordinary being, and Chu Feng was the first one to satiate her appetite. So, she ended up instinctively viewing Chu Feng as her father. If you take out some source energies to feed her right now, she might just call you her mommy,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;Is that so? I do have some source energies on hand at the moment,&rdquo; Wang Yuxian said.<br>&ldquo;Miss Wang, you seem oddly proactive about this.&rdquo;<br>With narrowed eyes, Eggy teased Wang Yuxian cheekily.<br>&ldquo;The three of you shouldn&rsquo;t talk nonsense.&rdquo;<br>It was then that the Lady of Dao Sea walked over and assessed the female baby in Chu Feng&rsquo;s arms close-up too. Chu Feng passed the female baby over to the Lady of Dao Sea so that the latter could take a closer look.<br>&ldquo;Grandma! Grandma!&rdquo;<br>The female baby didn&rsquo;t seem to be averse to the Lady of Dao Sea. Instead, she even began addressing the latter intimately too. Under her sweet calls, the Lady of Dao Sea&rsquo;s solemn face quickly collapsed into a smile too.<br>Had it not been for the wariness she felt toward the female baby, she would have surely been fond of the latter too.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, who do you intend to deal with this female baby?&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea asked.<br>&ldquo;This matter concerns the Asura Graveyard, but I didn&rsquo;t think that it would be a female baby inside that box. To be honest, I&rsquo;m not very sure how to handle this situation either,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied honestly.<br>&ldquo;This female baby consumes source energies to grow. Even though she&rsquo;s a world spirit, it would be a huge mistake to view her as any ordinary world spirits. There might be no demonic energy on her, but the earlier commotion showed that she&rsquo;s no ordinary being.<br>&ldquo;If young friend Chu Feng doesn&rsquo;t mind, I do have an idea in mind. You can entrust her with me for the time being. I&rsquo;ll keep an eye out for her, and if there&rsquo;s really something amiss about her, I&rsquo;ll be able to handle it right away. Of course, this child is still yours. If you change your mind at any point in time, you can come over to fetch her,&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you should leave her with the Lady of Dao Sea for the time being. It won&rsquo;t be convenient for you to bring a child around with you. Besides, the Dao Sea is filled with women, so we can trust them to take care of her well. Aren&rsquo;t you planning to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect to find Zi Ling?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>Chu Feng had already told Eggy about the message his master had left for him in the letter delivered by Zhang Yingxiong, so Eggy had a clear idea of what Chu Feng was planning to do next.<br>In truth, Chu Feng&rsquo;s initial thought was to simply seal off whatever that was in the box if it was a demonic being. However, who could have thought that it would actually be a female baby?<br>Had she been born in the Asura Graveyard, she would have likely been accorded the highest of treatments. Given that Chu Feng was the one who smuggled her out, it would be wrong for him to leave her to the lurch. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel responsible for her.<br>However, Eggy was right as well. He was planning to enter the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, and this female baby, as adorable as she might be, was a potential risk factor.<br>And most importantly of all, this female baby thrived on source energies. Chu Feng had saved up a huge amount of source energies for Eggy while the latter was in closed-door training, but just earlier on, this female baby had already devoured it all.<br>There was no way Chu Feng could go around killing innocent people in order to feed this child, right?<br>&ldquo;Elder, this female baby needs source energies in order to grow. What is your plan regarding that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mere source energies. I have my ways. Rest assured, as long as this female baby isn&rsquo;t a demonic being, I won&rsquo;t mistreat or starve her. However, if she turns out to be a threat, I&rsquo;ll have to apologize in advance, but I have no intentions of leaving her be. Of course, if young friend Chu Feng finds it hard to trust me, you may take her away with you,&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea said.<br>&ldquo;What are you saying, elder? How could I possibly not trust you? Since you have generously offered your help, I'm counting on you to take care of her then,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m heartened by the trust you have in me. I haven&rsquo;t done anything much to help you today, so you need not consider this as a request. I still owe you a favor for saving Lele, so if you find yourself faced with any difficulties in the future, feel free to look for me. I&rsquo;ll surely aid you,&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea said.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m flattered by your kindness, elder.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t reject the Lady of Dao Sea&rsquo;s offer. He was still weak at the moment, and he had unwittingly made a lot of enemies. In desperate situations, he might really need the Lady of Dao Sea&rsquo;s help.<br>Having made up his mind, Chu Feng entrusted the female baby he had taken out from the Asura Graveyard to the Lady of Dao Sea and prepared to leave the area. He was planning to head for the formation that led into the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>&ldquo;Daddy, daddy!&rdquo;<br>However, seemingly sensing that Chu Feng was planning to leave her, the female baby began bawling loudly. This made Chu Feng feel a little guilt-ridden, and he suddenly found himself a little unwilling to leave.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you haven&rsquo;t given her a name yet. She calls you her father, so shouldn&rsquo;t you be the one to name her?&rdquo; Wang Yuxian asked.<br>&ldquo;I thought that she would be a fearsome demon, but who could have thought that she would be so adorable? Since &lsquo;demon&rsquo; is my first impression of her, why don&rsquo;t we call her Yaoyao?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you being too casual here? Who in the world would name a girl Yaoyao? However, I do like the name a lot, so let&rsquo;s go with it,&rdquo; Eggy said with a giggle.<br>&ldquo;Yaoyao sounds great. If the child minds it in the future, we can simply change the characters with a homophone,&rdquo; Wang Yuxian added.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s settled then. Child, remember this. From this day onward, you&rsquo;ll be known as Yaoyao. This is the name that I&rsquo;ve given you. If you&rsquo;re obedient, I&rsquo;ll surely come back in the future to fetch you, alright?&rdquo; Chu Feng patted the female baby&rsquo;s head as he spoke.<br>&ldquo;Uwaaa! Daddy doesn&rsquo;t want me anymore! Daddy wants to abandon me!&rdquo;<br>However, the female baby still wasn&rsquo;t taking Chu Feng&rsquo;s departure well, and she began crying even more sorrowfully. This made Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart ache a little for her, and his reluctance to leave grew even more.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you should hurry along. The child is in safe hands, so you need not worry,&rdquo; the Lady of Dao Sea said.<br>Chu Feng also knew that it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to coax this female baby, so he chose to decisively turn around and take her leave. He quickly stepped through a teleportation formation before rushing toward the teleportation formation leading toward the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect!<br></p></div>
