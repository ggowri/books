        <div>: An Illusion That Pierces the Heart<br>Weng!<br>While Bai Yunqing was struggling to make sense of the situation, Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation had already begun to unravel the formation embedded in the wall.<br>Boom!<br>Under Chu Feng&rsquo;s attacks, the wall began to violently tremor. The strength of the deciphering formation did play a part in the breaching of a formation, but it greatly helped if the world spiritist was able to maneuver it well.<br>Bai Yunqing started to see Chu Feng in a different light. He had grudgingly submitted to Chu Feng earlier due to Eggy&rsquo;s overwhelming prowess, but now, he was truly in awe of Chu Feng. Be it in terms of the construction or maneuvering of the formation, Chu Feng&rsquo;s capabilities were clearly above his.<br>And that was exactly what baffled Bai Yunqing.<br>He was Bai Yunqing, a top-notch world spiritist prodigy in the current generation! It shouldn&rsquo;t have been possible for anyone to be so much stronger than him!<br>Boom!<br>With an explosion, the wall collapsed. Chu Feng had managed to breach the formation.<br>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t even take fifteen minutes! Young hero Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re amazing! Bai Yunqing spent thirty minutes on the formation and failed to breach it, but you were able to do it within fifteen minutes&rsquo; time. On top of that, you&rsquo;re only at White Dragon God-cloak. How did you do it?&rdquo;<br>The Ancient Realm&rsquo;s juniors were filled with compliments for Chu Feng, especially the women. They looked as if they had just witnessed a miracle.<br>Who said that Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t worthy of being the team leader?<br>If he wasn&rsquo;t worthy, no one else was!<br>Chu Feng responded to their compliments with a smile before turning to look at Bai Yunqing. &ldquo;How is it? Do you think that I&rsquo;m worthy of being the team leader now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I underestimated you. Who&rsquo;s your master?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing asked.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with all of your questions? Call me big brother,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Right, call him big brother!&rdquo; The Ancient Realm&rsquo;s juniors also joined in the fun.<br>As reluctant as Bai Yunqing was, he still held his promise. &ldquo;B-big brother&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be the one to breach the subsequent formations. You assist me,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Bai Yunqing silently consented to it. He knew that the formations would only get harder from this point onward. Both Chu Feng&rsquo;s discerning eye and ability to breach formation were above his. He had to grudgingly admit that the best way to clear this test was for the two of them to work together.<br>The group advanced ahead. Now that Chu Feng and Bai Yunqing were working together, it had become much easier for them to breach the formations. This continued till they finally arrived before a gigantic spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;Stop for a moment.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng carefully assessed the spirit formation gate. He could sense danger in it.<br>Through his observation, he could discern the presence of an illusory formation mixed with many others inside the spirit formation gate. It would be dangerous for them to enter it. Thus, he came to a decision.<br>&ldquo;Only Bai Yunqing and I will enter this spirit formation gate. The rest of you wait here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Understood,&rdquo; the Ancient Realm&rsquo;s juniors replied.<br>They were already completely won over by Chu Feng after witnessing his impressive capabilities. Naturally, they were inclined to listen to him too.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have any problems with it, right?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked Bai Yunqing.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mere illusory formation. Of course I don&rsquo;t have a problem with it!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing snorted before stepping into the spirit formation gate.<br>&ldquo;Why is that fellow so arrogant? I think he needs another beating,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;Putting aside that fellow&rsquo;s character and foul mouth, he does have talent as a world spiritist. It&rsquo;s no wonder Taishi Xingzhong took him in as his disciple,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;You seem to have a high opinion of him,&rdquo; Eggy remarked in surprise.<br>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think that he&rsquo;s that bad of a person after interacting with him,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>In truth, he had been observing Bai Yunqing throughout the journey. He had secretly constructed a formation that would automatically open his World Spirit Space should he come under attack, thus allowing Eggy to beat Bai Yunqing to a pulp.<br>But Bai Yunqing didn&rsquo;t make a move at all, which showed something.<br>Seeing that Bai Yunqing had entered the spirit formation gate, Chu Feng quickly did the same too.<br>On the other side of the gate was a majestic palace suffused with tremendous spirit power. As much as it was a palace, it was also a formation.<br>&ldquo;This illusory formation looks lifelike,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked.<br>To his surprise, he didn&rsquo;t receive any response, as if Eggy was unable to talk to him. Perplexed, he tried to enter his World Spirit Space, but he found that he was unable to do so.<br>&ldquo;Did the illusory formation sever our connection?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng had an ominous feeling. The illusory formation was stronger than he had expected.<br>Creak!<br>The palace gate suddenly opened, and numerous powerful world spiritists walked in. They were all True Dragon World Spiritists, and fairly powerful ones at that. There was a token hanging on their waists.<br>Seven Realms Sacred Mansion!<br>&ldquo;They are from the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion! Did the illusory formation see through my inner demons and stage a play?&rdquo; Chu Feng chuckled under his breath.<br>Having been through many illusory formations himself, Chu Feng knew that whatever he encountered inside were just illusions intended to beguile him into a trap. All he had to do was to stand firm and remind himself that this was all fake.<br>Soon, another person walked into the palace.<br>It was a woman with a beautiful figure and an ethereal disposition, though her face was obscured. Even so, Chu Feng felt his heart skip a beat when he saw her.<br>&ldquo;Mother? Could she be my mother?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng activated his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes to take a closer look at the woman&rsquo;s appearance, but it was to no avail.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng panicked, especially when he saw that the woman was shackled. He tried taking a step forward.<br>Jip jip!<br>Innumerable blood-red worms dived out of the ground. These worms resembled lizards, but they were much larger. They opened their mouths wide, revealing their blood-red teeth, and bit down on Chu Feng&rsquo;s thigh.<br>Chu Feng hurriedly constructed a defensive formation to protect his own leg.<br>Kacha!<br>It was futile. The worms bit through Chu Feng&rsquo;s formation and chomped down on his flesh.<br>&ldquo;Damn it! It&rsquo;s a trap!&rdquo;<br>This pain was still bearable to him, but the same couldn&rsquo;t be said for anyone else in his place. It was fortunate that the worms only bit him once before diving back underground, but he knew that he mustn&rsquo;t make a careless move anymore. He could only watch the show.<br>A tall platform appeared in the palace, and the woman made her way toward the platform. Just then, another person entered the palace, and all of the world spiritists present immediately kneeled down to pay respects to him.<br>That person was obscured by a glowing light, making it impossible to discern his appearance, but he emanated an extremely powerful aura.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too late for regrets,&rdquo; the elder told the woman.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me, father. I don&rsquo;t change my mind that easily. You can take away whatever you want from me,&rdquo; the woman said as she laid down on the platform.<br>Weng!<br>Light shone from the platform and quickly enveloped the entire palace. The formation inside the palace had been activated.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s vision should have been limited under normal circumstances, but he was still able to see everything clearly, possibly because the illusory formation wanted him to.<br>&ldquo;What kind of formation is that? Just what kind of demonic arts does the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion practice?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could tell from his instincts that the formation was used only by demonic sects and was extremely dangerous. He shuddered to wonder what the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion was going to do to the woman whom he believed to be his mother.<br>&ldquo;Is it worth going that far for an outsider? How could you bear the child of a nobody? You are a disgrace to our Seven Realms Sacred Mansion! I should have never groomed you!&rdquo; the elder bellowed.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s neither an outsider nor a nobody. He&rsquo;s the only one in the world I am willing to entrust myself to! Father, you&rsquo;ll know one day that I&rsquo;m right,&rdquo; the woman said.<br>&ldquo;Obstinate. Do it!&rdquo; the elder ordered.<br>Shoosh shoosh shoosh!<br>The world spiritists around Chu Feng&rsquo;s mother whipped out sinister blood-red daggers.<br>&ldquo;What are you all doing?&rdquo; Chu Feng roared.<br>He was tempted to take a step forward, but he knew that this was a lie. The abyss of despair awaited him if he succumbed to his instincts and ran over.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>Even so, Chu Feng was unable to control his emotions. How could he remain calm when his mother was being tortured right before his eyes?<br>&ldquo;Mansion Master, do we really have to do this?&rdquo; the world spiritists asked.<br>&ldquo;Do it! She wouldn&rsquo;t have obtained the Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline if not for me and her mother. Since she refuses to obey the rules of our Seven Realms Mansion, her bloodline ought to be stripped away and given to someone more worthy of it!&rdquo; the elder said.<br>&ldquo;They are planning to take away my mother&rsquo;s Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline?&rdquo; Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes flickered in anger.<br>The world spiritists raised the daggers in their hands. A blood-red light originating from the formation gleaned from those daggers.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fake, Chu Feng! It&rsquo;s all fake! The illusory formation is trying to beguile you!&rdquo; Chu Feng tried to tell himself, but he was still unable to hold himself back.<br>Even if it was just an illusion, that was still his mother. He couldn&rsquo;t turn a blind eye to her plight, even if he knew that it was all lies. He raised his head and looked at the altar his mother was lying on.<br>&ldquo;You bastards! Get away from my mother!&rdquo; Chu Feng roared.<br>He whipped out his weapon and charged at the altar, decapitating the world spiritist closest to him without any hesitation.<br>Shoosh!<br>To his astonishment, the world spiritist, along with his mother, the altar, and everyone else dissipated to a wisp of air. In the blink of an eye, Chu Feng was the only one left in the palace.<br>Jip jip jip!<br>Shrill sounds echoed behind Chu Feng. He quickly turned around to take a look, only to feel a rush of relief.<br>Where he was standing earlier, there were at least tens of thousands of blood-red worms larger and thicker than the one that had bitten him earlier.<br>&ldquo;So, that&rsquo;s the truth behind this trial. What a close shave!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng belatedly realized that the crux to the illusory formation was to not endure it. It was actually not that difficult to turn a blind eye to injustice upon knowing that it was all fake. All he had to do was to close his eyes to overlook the atrocities happening before his eyes.<br>In contrast, it took more courage to step in and intervene, especially when he knew that he was putting himself in danger for no reason.<br>It was fortunate that Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t hold himself in and instead chose to obey his heart, or else he might have been gobbled up by those worms.<br>Weng!<br>The palace suddenly dissipated in a wisp of air, revealing a black cavern.<br>&ldquo;Are you fine, Chu Feng?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Eggy,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Are you sure? Everything that happened earlier is all fake, so don&rsquo;t think too much into it,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;You saw the earlier illusion?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I did, but I was unable to communicate with you,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;It really is a formidable formation,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a chuckle.<br>He had been affected by the illusory formation despite knowing that it was fake. Even if his mother hadn&rsquo;t been stripped of her Ruler&rsquo;s Bloodline, she was unlikely to be faring well under the imprisonment of the Seven Realms Sacred Mansion.<br>It was hard for him to bide his time anymore after witnessing the earlier sight. He wanted to visit the Seven Realm Sacred Mansion right now to take a look. He wanted to ascertain if his mother was truly safe.<br></div>
