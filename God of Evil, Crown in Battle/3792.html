        <h1>Chapter 3791</h1>
        <div> - Senior, You&rsquo;re Also Here?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Who dared to act so arrogant?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Yang Shenshen&rsquo;s expression became ugly.<br>Yang Shenshen was also someone with a fiery temper. Although she did not stir up trouble like Miao Yu, she refused to allow anyone to insult their Watermirror Paradise.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who he is. However, that man is truly arrogant.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, judging from his appearance, he is not someone from Cloud Paradise. I don&rsquo;t know who gave him the nerve to dare challenge our Watermirror Paradise.&rdquo;<br>Miao Yu had a look of grievance on his face as he said those words.<br>&ldquo;Miao Yu, is what you said the truth?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you dare to lie to me, don&rsquo;t blame me for using the sect&rsquo;s rules to punish you,&rdquo; the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster said.<br>&ldquo;Lord Headmaster, this junior would not dare lie to you. He indeed said those things,&rdquo; Miao Yu said.<br>&ldquo;Humph. What utter nerve! That man actually dares to challenge our Watermirror Paradise?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Miao Yu, where is that person? Lead the way. We don&rsquo;t have to wait for him to come to our Watermirror Paradise. I will personally go and face him,&rdquo; the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster said as he stood up.<br>&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes. Lord Headmaster, I will guide you to him right away.&rdquo;<br>Seeing that their Lord Headmaster was actually planning to personally take care of the matter, Miao Yu felt overjoyed, and immediately began leading the way.<br>Miao Yu felt that he would gain great honor should it be known that he had managed to move the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster to stand up for him. With that, who would possibly dare provoke him again?<br>Even though he had already brought his backing to find Chu Feng, the journey back was still going to take some time.<br>This worried Luo Zhi and the others that were waiting to see Chu Feng suffer.<br>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t they here yet? Could it be that they don&rsquo;t dare to come?&rdquo; someone muttered quietly.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible. Miao Yu is the grandson of a Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s Supreme Elder.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could he possibly fear that madman?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It must either be that his grandfather is in closed-door training, or he has encountered some other sort of issue. However, being afraid of that madman is definitely not the case,&rdquo; said Luo Zhi.<br>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s as young master Luo Zhi has said, wouldn&rsquo;t that Asura be done for?&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a voice was heard. It was Wang Lian.<br>It turned out that Wang Lian also hadn't left. Not only that, but she had stealthily found Luo Zhi and the others.<br>&ldquo;Oh my, if it isn&rsquo;t Elder Wang Lian. Why aren&rsquo;t you with Song Ge accompanying that madman?&rdquo; Luo Zhi&rsquo;s friends asked mockingly after seeing her.<br>&ldquo;Young master Luo Zhi, Song Ge is foolish, but I, Wang Lian, am not foolish like her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That Asura is nothing more than a madman. How could I dance around a madman like him?&rdquo; said Wang Lian.<br>&ldquo;Seems like you have a discerning eye, and know how to distinguish right from wrong.&rdquo;<br>After hearing what Wang Lian had said, Luo Zhi&rsquo;s friends nodded in satisfaction.<br>&ldquo;Look! They&rsquo;ve come!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, someone discovered that the people from the Watermirror Paradise had appeared in the longue.<br>&ldquo;Such grand characters came too? That madman is definitely doomed.&rdquo;<br>Seeing the people that had entered the longue, Luo Zhi became extremely excited.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Brother Luo Zhi, who are those people?&rdquo; someone behind Luo Zhi asked.<br>&ldquo;I knew you all wouldn&rsquo;t know them. Here, let me introduce them to you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That person over there is Miao Yu&rsquo;s grandfather, one of the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s Supreme Elders.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for that young woman, she is the granddaughter of the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s current headmaster. She is also the strongest genius of the Watermirror Paradise, Yang Shenshen,&rdquo; Luo Zhi explained to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;So she&rsquo;s Yang Shenshen? I&rsquo;ve heard that Yang Shenshen is a Martial Immortal-level expert.&rdquo;<br>Upon learning that the young woman was Yang Shenshen, their eyes all started shining.<br>After all, Yang Shenshen was a famous genius in their Seven Suns Mountain Range region.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a rush to be so excited just yet. Look carefully. See that old man behind Yang Shenshen?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That person is Yang Shenshen&rsquo;s grandfather, the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He is a top expert with a cultivation of rank four Exalted,&rdquo; said Luo Zhi.<br>&ldquo;Even the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster came?!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would appear that that fellow by the name of Asura is truly screwed this time around.&rdquo;<br>Like Luo Zhi, the others had also become especially excited.<br>They had believed that the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s Supreme Elder was already a major existence.<br>As for the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster, he was simply an existence so powerful that he was akin to a legend.<br>No matter how talented Asura might be, he would still suffer facing those grand existences.<br>Miao Yu was actually also thinking the same thing.<br>Thus, aggressively, Miao Yu brought the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster and the others to the room Chu Feng was in.<br>When he saw that Chu Feng and Song Ge were actually still in the room, he was immediately overjoyed.<br>He was originally afraid that his effort to bring the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster over would be a waste if Chu Feng had fled.<br>Never did he expect that Chu Feng was actually still here.<br>&ldquo;Brat, seems like you possess courage.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, you must still pay for your actions!&rdquo; Miao Yu said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Senior?&rdquo;<br>Yang Shenshen walked into the room. When she saw Chu Feng, she was immediately stunned.<br>&ldquo;What? Senior?&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing that Yang Shenshen actually addressed Chu Feng as Senior, Miao Yu was immediately petrified. As for Luo Zhi, Wang Lian and the others observing from the shadows using special techniques, they were also stunned.<br>What was happening?<br>Why would the majestic granddaughter of the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster, the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s strongest genius, Yang Shenshen, address that madman as senior?<br>Could it be that they&rsquo;d misheard her?<br>&ldquo;Senior Asura, why are you also here?&rdquo;<br>At the moment when they were confused, the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster also walked in.<br>When he saw Chu Feng, he was pleasantly surprised. In fact, he even revealed more excitement than Yang Shenshen.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo;<br>It was no longer only Miao Yu, Luo Zhi, Wang Lian and the others that were stunned. Even Song Ge, who was beside Chu Feng, was completely shocked.<br>Even though she knew that he was unfathomable and an expert among experts, she had never imagined Chu Feng to be so powerful that even the Watermirror Paradise&rsquo;s headmaster would address Chu Feng as &lsquo;senior&rsquo; upon seeing him.<br>At that moment, she finally realized why Chu Feng had not shown any concern after finding out that Ma Liang was the Cloud Paradise&rsquo;s Supreme Elder&rsquo;s disciple.<br>It turned out that Chu Feng was truly powerful enough to show no concern for it.<br></p></div>
