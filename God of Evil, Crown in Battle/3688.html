        <h1>Chapter 3687</h1>
        <div> - Mastermind<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Milady, Milord, please spare us, please spare us.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, voices of people begging for forgiveness were heard again. It was the people of the crusading army.<br>At the start, there were over ten thousand people in the group of crusaders who stood against the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Although a portion of them had decided to directly escape after being beaten back by the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the great majority of them were still present.<br>After the Blood-devouring Hall appeared, a portion of those who had decided to stay decided to accompany them in attacking the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Those people were the ones that Gu Mingyuan had killed earlier.<br>The ones that were begging for forgiveness at that moment were the ones that had been spared by the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, and had decided to stay and watch without joining the Blood-devouring Hall in attacking the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>They were not ingrates who repaid the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s kindness with malice, like the ones that were killed earlier.<br>Compared to them, those people could be considered to be rather righteous.<br>However, it remained that their original intention for being there was to enact a suppression of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Because of that, they were afraid that Gu Mingyuan and the Chu Heavenly Clan would be unwilling to spare them.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on with those people?&rdquo; asked Gu Mingyuan.<br>As she had arrived late, she didn&rsquo;t know the specifics of what had happened.<br>&ldquo;Senior, they also came to cause trouble. However, they were beaten back by my Lord Clan Chief, and were spared by him. Since they appreciated the kindness that was given, and did not attack us again like those ingrates, we should let them go.&rdquo;<br>Although Chu Feng had also arrived some time later, he had arrived long before Gu Mingyuan. Thus, he had learned about the situation from the conversations of the bystanders.<br>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the case.&rdquo;<br>Gu Mingyuan nodded. Then, she waved her sleeve.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, countless specks of light flew out from her sleeve. Like arrows, they shot into the kneeling people.<br>When the specks of light entered their bodies, the crowd all revealed frightened expressions. They all thought that Gu Mingyuan was planning to kill them.<br>However, they soon discovered that even though those specks of light had entered their bodies, they did not leave any injuries on them. Furthermore, they did not feel any pain either.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s soul poison!&rdquo;<br>Soon, someone cried out in fear. That person had managed to determine what the specks of light were.<br>&ldquo;What? Soul poison?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the expressions of the crowd turned deathly pale.<br>As its name implied. The so-called &lsquo;soul poison&rsquo; was a poison to one&rsquo;s soul.<br>After reaching their level of cultivation, the physical body was merely a housing for the soul. The soul was their actual root..<br>Even if their physical bodies were destroyed, they would not feel any pain. However, if their souls were injured, even if it was only a small wound, it would bring them enormous pain.<br>As for the soul poison, it was capable of assimilating with their soul. From this, one could imagine what sort of consequence the poison would bring.<br>Soul poison was something that posed a threat to their lives.<br>&ldquo;This soul poison of mine will not take your lives. It will also not affect your future cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As long as you all are able to keep your distance from the Chu Heavenly Clan, I guarantee that you will be able to live to your maximum lifespan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, should you be unwilling to repent, and decide to foolishly attack the Chu Heavenly Clan again, the soul poison will have you all know what it means to be more miserable alive than dead,&rdquo; Gu Mingyuan said coldly.<br>&ldquo;Lady Princess, we wouldn&rsquo;t dare do that. We truly wouldn&rsquo;t dare do that anymore. Please spare us.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Lady Princess, we beg of you. We only came here today for false bravado. We never really planned to do anything to the Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>Completely scared, those people were kneeling and begging for forgiveness.<br>However, faced with the crowd&rsquo;s begging, Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s expression remained unchanged. Not only did she show no sign of pity, she instead said in annoyance, &ldquo;You all can either scram right now, or I will activate the soul poison inside you.&rdquo;<br>Once she said those words, no one dared to stay anymore. After all, Gu Mingyuan did not even blink when she had massacred those people earlier.<br>Although they addressed her as the Ten Thousand Province Ancient Clan&rsquo;s Lady Princess, it would be more accurate to address her as a demoness.<br>Thus, although they were unwilling, those people did not dare to hesitate. They turned around and fled.<br>Their fleeing looks were very miserable.<br>Seeing that, the crowd came to a complete understanding of how Gu Mingyuan handled things.<br>Compared to the magnanimous Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief who directly released those people, Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s method provided an even better guarantee for the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>Even Chu Feng started feeling greater admiration for her.<br>Chu Feng already knew that the true leader of the Ten Thousand Provinces Ancient Clan was not their Clan Chief. Instead, it was their Lady Princess, Gu Mingyuan.<br>Seeing her at that moment, they agreed that her reputation was truly well-deserved.<br>&ldquo;Eeeaahhh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a miserable scream was heard.<br>It was the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. He had changed beyond recognition, and had lost consciousness.<br>Not only was he screaming miserably whilst unconscious, but bodies of light were also constantly being released from his body.<br>As those bodies of light dispersed, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief became weaker and weaker. He seemed to be rapidly approaching death.<br>&ldquo;Oh no! His soul is about to scatter!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that, Grandmaster Liangqiu and Liangqiu Chengfeng both rushed over. They arrived beside the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, activated their spirit techniques, and began to stabilize his condition.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, my clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief took a forbidden medicine. Can his condition be treated?&rdquo;<br>At practically the same time, Chu Feng also rushed over. He had already learned that his Lord Clan Chief had taken a forbidden medicine, and was suffering from its backlash. Merely, he had never imagined it to be so serious. Judging from his current condition, the backlash was endangering his life.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you can rest assured. Although it is somewhat problematic, with this old man here, nothing major will happen to him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, we must be given a place so that we can immediately and completely treat him. Otherwise, the consequences will be enormous,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Once he said those words, how would any of the Chu Heavenly Clansmen dare hesitate? They immediately prepared a place for Grandmaster Liangqiu to treat their Lord Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Senior, do you need my assistance?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with concern. He was still worried for the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you don&rsquo;t have to worry. Chenfeng and I will suffice. You should go and handle matters with your clan first.&rdquo;<br>The reason why Grandmaster Liangqiu said that was because he knew that the Chu Heavenly Clansmen would definitely not be able to take care of the captives from the Blood-devouring Hall.<br>If they wanted to take care of them, they had to rely on Gu Mingyuan.<br>However, judging from the current situation, it seemed like, apart from Chu Lingxi, Gu Mingyuan would only give face to Chu Feng.<br>Thus, Chu Feng had to remain there.<br>As for how to handle the nine people from the Blood-devouring Hall, it would naturally not be as simple as killing them.<br>If killing them could solve the issue, Gu Mingyuan would&rsquo;ve done so earlier. With her personality, she would never keep those that she had offended alive.<br>The reason why she kept them alive was because the Blood-devouring Hall did not possess any hatred with the Chu Heavenly Clan. They had chosen to attack the Chu Heavenly Clan because they were prompted by someone.<br>Thus, they must determine who the mastermind behind the scenes was.<br>That mastermind would be the actual threat.<br>If they did not determine who that mastermind was, there would be no end to the troubles.<br>After all, to be able to move the Blood-devouring Hall&rsquo;s Hall Master himself, that mastermind must be someone extraordinary.<br></p></div>
