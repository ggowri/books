        <h1>Chapter 3004</h1>
        <div> - The Correct Decision<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, following a loud explosion, the cave started to tremble again. Furthermore, the trembling this time around was even stronger than before.<br>&ldquo;It really is going to collapse! Everyone, quickly, get out of here!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If we continue to stay here, we will truly be buried alive!&rdquo;<br>This time around, the crowd started to panic completely. They turned around and began to flee in the direction they had come from.<br>Everyone was fleeing. However, Chu Lingxi was still standing there. She was still attacking the sealed entrance.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi, why are you still standing there? Do you wish to die here?&rdquo; Chu Huanyu asked.<br>However, Chu Lingxi did not even bother to pay attention to his words. It was as if she could not hear him.<br>&ldquo;Gone mad, you&rsquo;ve truly gone mad!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, you might as well die here together with that Chu Feng!&rdquo; Unable to contain his anger, Chu Huanyu cursed loudly. Then, together with the rest of the crowd, he left the cave.<br>The cave that was previously filled with people now only had Chu Lingxi..<br>As the trembling around her continued to become more and more intense, she held her Incomplete Immortal Armament in her hand and continued to unleash powerful Immortal Techniques.<br>She appeared to be quite lonely. However, her stubbornness and her determination in the face of death was something worthy of being revered.<br>Unfortunately, those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations were not going to revere her.<br>To them, Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s actions were foolish and mad.<br>Only Chu Lingxi knew that she could not abandon Chu Feng and escape by herself. After all&hellip; ever since they had fused their Yin Yang Fate Pearls, their fates would be bound to one another as long as they were there.<br>At present she did not feel anything peculiar. This meant that Chu Feng was still alive.<br>However, with what was happening, it was very possible that Chu Feng had encountered some sort of problem.<br>Thus, she could not give up. As long as Chu Feng was still alive, she could not give up on him.<br>&hellip;...<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, another loud explosion was heard. The explosion this time was much more ear-piercing than all the previous explosions. It was as if the explosion had gone off somewhere very close. The frequency of the quaking was frighteningly abnormal.<br>However, after the loud explosion was heard, everything seemed to have returned to normal.<br>&ldquo;Damn it, exactly what happened in there?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, no matter what, you must stay alive in there. Otherwise, this young lady will end up suffering a calamity too,&rdquo; Chu Lingxi was startled by the explosion. However, she soon started to continue using her Incomplete Immortal Armament to attack the power sealing the entrance.<br>Even though the explosions and shaking had stopped, Chu Lingxi felt even more uneasy. She was truly afraid that something might&rsquo;ve happened to Chu Feng.<br>It was not that she was afraid of being implicated. Rather, she truly did not wish for anything to happen to Chu Feng.<br>Meanwhile, inside the deepest region of the cave, Chu Feng was still standing there. Since he was protected by the defensive barrier, he was completely unscathed.<br>Not only that, but a cheerful look had also appeared in his eyes.<br>Even though the energy ripples were still surging about the cave, Chu Feng was able to see through his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes that Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather was lying in a corner. His body was completely covered in blood.<br>However, when he looked to Lord Youyuan, he was completely unscathed.<br>Although they were both rank two Exalted, Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather was no match for Lord Youyuan.<br>&ldquo;Youyuan, I&rsquo;ve underestimated you. Never would I have expected that you&hellip; a foreign dog, would possess this sort of power.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, today, you are still going to lose,&rdquo; right at that moment, Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather suddenly turned around. He was flying toward the other member of the younger generation present.<br>Due to the fact that Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather was very close to that man, it was already too late by the time Lord Youyuan noticed his intention.<br>Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather grabbed the neck of that member of the younger generation and lifted him up before him.<br>&ldquo;Release him,&rdquo; Lord Youyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Release him? Sure, I can do that. Let go of the Immortal Armament in your hand,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather said.<br>&ldquo;You want me to let go of my Immortal Armament? You are truly delusional,&rdquo; Lord Youyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Youyuan, I will say it again. Let go of the Immortal Armament in your hand. Otherwise, I will kill him,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather threatened with a malevolent expression.<br>Faced with Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather&rsquo;s threat this time around, Lord Youyuan did not even bother to utter a word. However, his determined expression had given Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather his answer.<br>&ldquo;Chu Youyuan, it turns out you&rsquo;re also someone who doesn't care about the lives of your fellow clansmen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Youyuan, do you not feel ashamed?!!!&rdquo; Seeing that his plan had failed, Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather started to shout angrily.<br>Even though he was faced with mocking words from Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather, Lord Youyuan remained extremely calm.<br>&ldquo;The one that wants to kill him is you and not me, why should I feel ashamed?&rdquo; Lord Youyuan said.<br>&ldquo;You, since you have no regard for the lives of others why must you pretend to be righteous?&rdquo; Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather asked.<br>&ldquo;This old man has never feigned righteousness, nor have I disregarded the lives of others. Merely, I know how to make appropriate decisions at appropriate times.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If I am to let go of my Immortal Armament, I would not be a match for you. At that time, it would not only be me who will be killed, Chu Feng and that person you&rsquo;ve captured will also be killed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if I persist, the only one that will die will be that person you&rsquo;ve captured. Although I will not be able to save him, at least Chu Feng would still be alive. To this old man, that would be a worthy decision,&rdquo; Lord Youyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Enough of this rubbish! I knew that you felt Chu Feng&rsquo;s life to be more important than the lives of other younger generations!&rdquo; Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather shouted.<br>&ldquo;If you insist on saying it like that, this old man will not argue with you,&rdquo; Lord Youyuan said.<br>&ldquo;You!!!&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather turned completely red with anger. However, he was also speechless.<br>Faced with such a Chu Youyuan, he truly had no words to say.<br>However, Chu Feng was surprised.<br>He truly did not expect for his life to be viewed with such importance by Chu Youyuan.<br>Suddenly, Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather shouted, &ldquo;Chu Youyuan, drop dead!&rdquo; Then, he tossed the member of the younger generation in his hand toward Lord Youyuan. After that, he turned around and began to fly toward the cave&rsquo;s exit.<br>The strength with which he tossed that member of the younger generation was no small matter. If someone could catch him, then he might be fine. However, if someone didn&rsquo;t catch him, he would definitely meet a horrible death when he smashed into the ground.<br>Although Lord Youyuan felt that man&rsquo;s life to not be as important as Chu Feng&rsquo;s life, that did not mean that he didn't consider his life to be important.<br>At the very least, when faced with the choice of saving that member of the younger generation or chasing after Chu Haoyan&rsquo;s grandfather, Lord Youyuan chose to save that member of the younger generation without the slightest hesitation. He leapt up and caught him. <br></p></div>
