        <h1>Chapter 4968</h1>
        <div>: The Monstrous Girl<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re a person of great talents. You aren&rsquo;t just the pride of the Chu Heavenly Clan but of our entire Holy Light Galaxy.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Buyu started off with a compliment before slowly explaining the situation to Chu Feng.<br>Even though the Holy Valley had been in seclusion all this while, it was not as if they were completely cut off from the external world. They would still often send patrols to scour the Holy Light Galaxy and Nine Souls Galaxy for potential fortuitous encounters, and they did manage to obtain many benefits through that.<br>Many years ago, they discovered a hidden ancient remnant in the Nine Souls Galaxy. The owner of the ancient remnant appeared to be an expert in the Ancient Era, and he had left a portion of his legacy there.<br>Obtaining that expert&rsquo;s legacy was a huge deal.<br>The only problem was that there was a restriction imposed on the ancient remnant. Similar to the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s legacy formation, it only allowed juniors to enter.<br>However, what was different about it was that the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s legacy formation was relatively risk-free. As long as one didn&rsquo;t foolishly attempt the dangerous trial, one would be fine even after failing the trial. In fact, one could even attempt it multiple times.<br>It was the opposite for the ancient remnant discovered from the Holy Valley. There was only one attempt, and failure spelled death.<br>The Holy Valley coveted the legacy in the ancient remnant, so it had sent many prodigies there over the years. However, all of them ended up losing their lives there.<br>Even so, the Holy Valley didn&rsquo;t mark it as a forbidden land. Instead, they bade their time for a prodigy outstanding enough to conquer the ancient remnant to emerge.<br>The current generation of the Holy Valley was the most outstanding one of all, and they should have already challenged the ancient remnant by now.<br>Ironically, the Holy Valley ended up pinning great hopes on the current generation, to the extent that they were afraid of endangering them. They felt that they had the resources to nurture their juniors into top-notch experts too, so there was no need to put them through an uncertain trial.<br>Even if the current generation of juniors simply trained methodically, they would still be able to push the Holy Valley to greater heights.<br>To send them into an unknown ancient remnant in search of an uncertain legacy was nothing more than an act of desperation. There was no need for the Holy Valley to take on this risk.<br>As a result, the Holy Monarch refused all requests from the juniors to challenge the ancient remnant.<br>However, Shengguang Buyu and Shengguang Baimei had witnessed Chu Feng&rsquo;s talents with their own eyes, and they believed that Chu Feng would be able to conquer the ancient remnant. If even Chu Feng was unable to clear the ancient remnant, it was unlikely that there would be anyone in the world who could pull it off.<br>Thus, after careful consideration, they decided to bring Chu Feng to the ancient remnant.<br>This would usually require the Holy Monarch&rsquo;s approval, but they decided to make this decision on their own accord. They believed that the Holy Monarch wouldn&rsquo;t object to their decision.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s no doubt about your talent, but the danger about the ancient remnant isn&rsquo;t just hearsay. You should decide for yourself whether you wish to take the risk or not. If you are up to it, I&rsquo;ll bring you there.<br>&ldquo;Otherwise, we&rsquo;ll return to the Holy Valley together. Once the Holy Monarch comes out of his closed-door training, we&rsquo;ll engage his help to deal with that old bastard Yin Ren and the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>&ldquo;Elder, is this appropriate? Would the Holy Monarch blame you and Elder Buyu for bringing me to the ancient remnant?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was worried.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of danger. He had only risen to his current position thanks to his willingness to dive into danger to grasp opportunities. Otherwise, someone who had started from a Lower Realm like him wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to come this far within such a short period of time.<br>He was more worried for Shengguang Baimei and Shengguang Buyu. The two of them had made this call on their own accord, but the ancient remnant was clearly of importance to the Holy Valley. They were putting themselves at risk.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. We know the personality of our Holy Monarch. He&rsquo;ll surely approve of our decision once he learns about your deeds. To be honest, it was the Holy Monarch who forbade our juniors from entering the ancient remnant. It&rsquo;s a waste to leave it hanging around, so we might as well give you a try,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said.<br>&ldquo;Alright. I wish to give it a try,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>The group immediately made its move. They split into two teams, where Shengguang Buyu returned to the Holy Valley whereas Shengguang Baimei, Daoist Niantian, and Chu Feng headed to the ancient remnant.<br>Along the way, Chu Feng tried asking about the ancient remnant, but Shengguang Baimei knew next to nothing about it.<br>It seemed like the ancient remnant was discovered by the previous Holy Monarch, and he didn&rsquo;t tell them anything about how he discovered it. He only said that the owner of the ancient remnant was a formidable figure and that challenging the ancient remnant came with huge risks, though there would be huge returns too.<br>That was why the Holy Valley continued sending juniors in despite knowing of the dangers.<br>This was especially so during the era of the previous Holy Monarch. He would send juniors over every year, such that the number of Holy Valley juniors who had died there numbered at least several thousand.<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t able to gather any significant information about the ancient remnant from Shengguang Baimei, but his interest was piqued. His intuition told him that his strength would grow by leaps and bounds if he could obtain the legacy there.<br>But perhaps it was because he was losing confidence in himself after the recent defeat in Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s hands, he thought that it was unlikely for things wouldn&rsquo;t go smoothly. He had a feeling that he would undergo great dangers in the ancient remnant.<br>Regardless, he was determined to give it a try.<br>The group traversed across starfields and eventually arrived at a place known as the Immortalspring Upper Realm. They made their way over to a flatland that looked perfectly ordinary at first glance, even to Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>However, Shengguang Baimei led Chu Feng and Daoist Niantian to a specific location in the midst of the flatland before diving underground. Despite their astounding speed, they dived for six whole hours, which showed just how deep underground they went.<br>At the end of the six hours, they finally arrived at an underground world.<br>This underground world was incredibly vast, filled with mountains and rivers of its own. The natural scenery that had thrived here was grand and beautiful.<br>But most importantly, the area was suffused with the aura of the Ancient Era.<br>Many of the towering trees and plants appeared to have come from the Ancient Era.<br>Despite being underground, there were many stones embedded in the ceiling that emanated brilliant light, dispelling the darkness. The concept of the night didn&rsquo;t exist in this underground world.<br>Shengguang Baimei continued proceeding ahead, but all of a sudden, his footsteps suddenly screeched to a halt.<br>He turned his eyes toward a specific direction, and Chu Feng and Daoist Niantian quickly did the same. It was quite some distance away, but they noticed a figure.<br>There were beings from the Ancient Era living in this underground world, so the three of them wouldn&rsquo;t have typically not been so concerned about the presence of another being in the vicinity. The problem was that the figure wasn&rsquo;t a being from the Ancient Era.<br>It was a little girl, looking to be around three years old.<br>Her face resembled an adorable bun, and her eyes were glowing energetically. On top of that, she was wearing extravagant clothes. It was not to say how elegant she was dressed, but that the clothes she was wearing were invaluable treasures.<br>Without a doubt, she was from an affluent family.<br>But why would the girl appear at a place like this?<br>According to Shengguang Baimei, the only ones who were aware of this ancient remnant were those from the Holy Valley. No one else should have known about its existence.<br>On top of that, the girl&rsquo;s dress-up hinted that she was from the present era.<br>Her appearance hinted that someone else had discovered this ancient remnant, and a person who was able to find this place mustn&rsquo;t be underestimated.<br>This is bad.<br>Chu Feng suddenly dashed in the direction of the girl. He noticed an Ancient Era being rising from the dirt, swiftly darting toward the girl. This being was only at Martial Ancestor level, making it no more than an ant before Chu Feng, but it indubitably posed great danger to a three-year-old child.<br>While Chu Feng was rushing over, the girl suddenly leaped into the air and stomped down on the Ancient Era being. With a single punch, she crushed the hundred-meters long being into a pile of flesh.<br>This sight shocked not just Chu Feng but Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian as well.<br>Most three-year-old children wouldn&rsquo;t have started cultivating yet, even in the most prestigious clans. Yet, that girl&rsquo;s cultivation had already reached True Immortal level!<br>It took Chu Feng many years of hard work in order to reach that level, but a three-year-old girl was actually able to reach the same level?<br>Even Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent seemed to amount to nothing before the girl.<br>While Chu Feng was shocked by the girl&rsquo;s strength, the girl suddenly raised her head to look at him.<br>Chu Feng was already within range to stop the Ancient Era&rsquo;s being, but he was still a considerable distance away from the girl. Under normal circumstances, even if the girl had reached True Immortal level, she shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to notice Chu Feng from such a distance away.<br>Yet, the girl clearly noticed Chu Feng. Her eyes started to curl into beautiful crescents, and she started running toward him. Not only so, she even stretched her hand forward, as if demanding a hug.<br>She even started crying out words that jolted Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart.<br>&ldquo;Daddy, daddy!!!&rdquo;<br></p></div>
