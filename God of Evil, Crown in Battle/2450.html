        <h1>Chapter 2449</h1>
        <div> - Emergence Of The War Sword<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Truth be told, we are merely a branch family of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan. We do not know much about the past of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, to us, that great senior of ours who first arrived in this place and taught us the way of martial cultivation is our Ancestor.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Our Ancestor was very powerful. Not only did he establish this War Clan&rsquo;s Ancient Domain, he also used his last bit of power to create a Martial Comprehension Ground.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After he finished constructing this place for martial cultivation, our Lord Ancestor passed away, having exhausted all of his energy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, to our Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan, that Martial Comprehension Ground is extremely important.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for Lord Zhan Haichuan, the place where he trained back then was also that Martial Comprehension Ground.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, it is a place where only the people of our War Clan are allowed to enter.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As such, we are truly sorry. We fear that we will not be able to satisfy Young Hero Chu Feng&rsquo;s desire.&rdquo;<br>After being silent for a long time, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke. He had a very apologetic expression on his face when he said those words.<br>His reaction was understandable. After all, he had made such extravagant claims earlier. And now, after Chu Feng gave his request, he was actually unable to satisfy it. As such, he would naturally feel very embarrassed.<br>&ldquo;Father, Lord Ancestor indeed spent a great amount of effort to create the Martial Comprehension Ground. In fact, he even lessened his own lifespan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, Lord Ancestor never said that only the people of our Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan are allowed to use that Martial Comprehension Ground.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We were the ones who decided that the Martial Comprehension Ground can only be used by the people of our clan. It is not Lord Ancestor who decided that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, I feel that it would be fine for Chu Feng to train in the Martial Comprehension Ground,&rdquo; Zhan Lingling said.<br>Hearing those words, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief revealed an angry expression. He wanted to lash out at his daughter.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, Young Hero Chu Feng has shown grace to our Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan. You also declared earlier that as long as it was something that our Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan was capable of, we would satisfy any demand that he might make.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the Martial Comprehension Ground, it is evidently a place that we can allow him to enter. If we are to refuse his request now, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that we would have gone back on our word?&rdquo; Right at that moment, a very old elder got up and started to urge their Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you&hellip;&rdquo;<br>After hearing the old man speak, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief revealed a surprised expression.<br>Actually, he had wanted to agree to Chu Feng&rsquo;s request. Merely, their Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan possessed their own rules. He had only refused Chu Feng&rsquo;s request because he did not want others to say that he had broken the rules because Chu Feng had saved his son and daughter.<br>That was also the reason why he had wanted to lash out at his daughter earlier.<br>Merely, he never expected that an elder of their Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan would also agree to have Chu Feng train in the Martial Comprehension Ground.<br>Furthermore, the elder who spoke was no ordinary elder.<br>He was a person who possessed grand status in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan, someone with greater seniority than even his father. In the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan, that elder&rsquo;s word held great weight.<br>In addition to that elder, there were three more elders with grand Statuses and great seniority in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan.<br>At that moment, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief turned his gaze to the other three elders. He wanted to see what their opinions might be.<br>&ldquo;The Martial Comprehension Ground is a treasure left behind by our Ancestor. However, it remains that a treasure will forever be a treasure, and inferior to one&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Today, Young Hero Chu Feng saved the lives of Lingling and Lingtong. I believe Lord Clan Chief is capable of determining which among them is more important.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Indeed. Young Hero Chu Feng only wants to enter that place to train because of his admiration for our clan&rsquo;s Lord Zhan Haichuan. Thus, I feel that we must allow him to enter the Martial Comprehension Ground to train. Else, it would make our Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan appear to be extremely petty, no?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I agree with them. Rules are dead, whereas people are alive. We cannot be hidebound by conventions.&rdquo;<br>After that, the remaining three elders with great status and seniority also voiced their positions.<br>At that moment, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was both shocked and overjoyed.<br>These four elders had always been people who were very hard to deal with. They were the sort of stubborn old antiques with very obstinate views.<br>Logically, according to their characters, they should have been making a supreme effort to refuse Chu Feng&rsquo;s request.<br>It was precisely because of that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief initially refused Chu Feng. He assumed that the four elders would most definitely oppose him if he were to agree to Chu Feng&rsquo;s request.<br>However, to his surprise, the four elders were completely different today. Not only did they not refuse, they even urged him to reconsider.<br>When even the four elders agreed to Chu Feng&rsquo;s request, the others in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan would naturally not voice any objections. Naturally, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would also not object to it anymore.<br>However, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did not make an announcement right away. Rather, he swept his gaze to the others present and asked, &ldquo;Everyone, what do you all think?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We agree with what Lord Elders have said. Lord Clan Chief, let&rsquo;s allow Young Hero Chu Feng to enter the Martial Comprehension Ground.&rdquo;<br>&hellip;...<br>It was as the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had anticipated, none of the remaining people spoke against the decision to allow Chu Feng to enter the Martial Comprehension Ground.<br>&ldquo;Since everyone feels this way, then our Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan will make an exception for Young Hero Chu Feng and satisfy this cherished desire of his,&rdquo; The Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you everyone,&rdquo; Chu Feng clasped his fist at the crowd.<br>Although Chu Feng had a calm expression on his face right now, he was incomparably excited in his heart.<br>At that moment, he no longer lacked cultivation resources. On the contrary, the Natural Energies contained in his dantian were craving to reach a breakthrough.<br>What Chu Feng needed right now was comprehension toward the way of Martial Cultivation so that he could reach a breakthrough in his cultivation.<br>In other words, what Chu Feng needed right now was precisely something like the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Martial Comprehension Ground.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, this is bad!!!&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, an elder wearing a black cloak rushed over hurriedly from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan.<br>Two individuals were following him. They were also wearing black cloaks.<br>Their cultivations were all quite strong; they were all Martial Ancestors.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; Upon seeing those three individuals, all of the people present stood up anxiously.<br>The reason for that was because those three individuals were no ordinary elders. Rather, they were all tasked with a very important mission.<br>Normally, the three of them would never show themselves. However, as long as they showed themselves, it meant that something major had happened. This was even more so with how panicky the three of them were right now.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword is moving,&rdquo; That elder said.<br>&ldquo;Moving?&rdquo; Hearing those words, the gazes of all of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clansmen present changed. All sorts of complicated expressions appeared in their eyes.<br>As members of the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan, they knew very well what the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword was.<br>It was the strongest of the Three Great Secret Skills that their Ancestor had left for them.<br>In all these years, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword had been still.<br>Even the strongest person to have appeared in their Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan since the death of their Ancestor, Zhan Haichuan, was unable to even awaken the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword even though he had managed to conquer the second strongest Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Spear.<br>Today, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword actually started to move. How could they not be alarmed by it?<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; The Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief soared into the sky. He planned to investigate what was happening.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, an ear-piercing sound was heard.<br>The sunny and cloudless sky started to turn dark.<br>The earth covered with a layer of spirit formations also started to violently tremble.<br>Every inch of space itself was affected by it. Regardless of their cultivation, regardless of whether they were standing in the sky or on the ground, no one was able to stand firmly.<br>Following the shaking space, they too started to sway left and right.<br>Soon, dazzling golden light shone from the direction where the sound originated.<br>Turning to look, the crowd discovered that an enormous sword was flying toward them.<br>That sword was a thousand meters long and the sword&rsquo;s body was golden in color. As it flew over, it hid the sky and covered the earth.<br>&ldquo;That is?!!!&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing that sword, everyone from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan was stunned. They started to sweat cold bullets.<br>They had managed to recognize with a single glance that the incoming sword was their Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s strongest secret skill, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword.<br>&ldquo;Clank~~~!!!&rdquo;<br>With incomparable might, the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Sword rapidly approached.<br>In the end, it stopped above the crowd like a god overlooking mortals.<br><br></p></div>
