        <div>: Situ Tingye&rsquo;s Decision<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng immediately scanned his surroundings, but to his surprise, he wasn&rsquo;t able to find the third person siphoning the energy at all.<br>&ldquo;What profound means. It looks like my opponents aren&rsquo;t just the Situ World Spiritist Clan and Bai Yunqing,&rdquo; Chu Feng muttered.<br>His intuition told him that this third person would be even more troublesome to deal with than Bai Yunqing and those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan. After all, it was much harder to dodge an arrow from the shadows.<br>It was fortunate that Chu Feng had noticed the presence of the third person, which allowed him to make preparations in advance.<br>Soon, the energy was completely sapped by Chu Feng, Bai Yunqing, and the third person. The doors to the ancient remnant also finally opened up fully.<br>Without any hesitation, Bai Yunqing entered the ancient remnant. Those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan hurriedly followed suit.<br>Naturally, Chu Feng and Song Yuwei did the same as well, just that no one noticed their presence.<br>Beyond the palace doors was a long corridor. Countless delicate paintings hung along the length of the long corridor, and each of them was unique in its own right.<br>They initially thought that there would be clues in these paintings, so they made sure to pay attention to it. Chu Feng did the same as well. However, they soon realized that these were just ordinary paintings, so they hastened their footsteps and hurried ahead.<br>They quickly arrived at the other end of the corridor, where they found another gate. It was physically opened wide, but a layer of energy prevented anyone from passing through it.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t just simple spirit power.<br>Bai Yunqing did some tests on the gate and discovered that it was harmless, so he fearlessly stepped into it. Those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan immediately tried to do the same too, but they found themselves blocked by the layer of energy.<br>It was almost as if there was a wall in front of them.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Does this barrier only allow juniors to pass?&rdquo;<br>That was the first deduction made by those from the Situ World Spiritist Clan.<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give it a try.&rdquo;<br>Situ Tingye glanced backward, and numerous suave and beautiful men and women stepped out from the crowd. The Situ World Spiritist Clan knew that many ancient remnants reserved their treasures for juniors, so they had come prepared.<br>These juniors tried walking through the door, but they also found themselves blocked by the layer of energy. They were unable to pass through it too.<br>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t work for juniors too?&rdquo;<br>Situ Tingye was baffled.<br>&ldquo;Lord Grand Elder, this doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an ordinary spirit power barrier. We aren&rsquo;t able to pass through it,&rdquo; the juniors replied.<br>The Situ World Spiritist Clan began trying out other means.<br>Chu Feng chuckled at that sight. He turned to Song Yuwei and said, &ldquo;Elder Yuwei, you should wait for me outside. The barrier only allows those who have obtained the preliminary key to pass.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young master Chu Feng, you have to take care of yourself. I&rsquo;ll wait for you outside,&rdquo; Song Yuwei replied.<br>She had followed Chu Feng in hopes that she would be of help to him, but she found herself unable to contribute at all. Along the way, Chu Feng had been the one solving all of the problems on his own.<br>This made her realize that she was nothing more than a baggage. Since she was unable to be of any help, she decided to listen to Chu Feng&rsquo;s arrangement and not weigh him down. She told him where she would be waiting for him before taking her leave.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng continued to venture deeper into the ancient remnant.<br>While the Situ World Spiritist Clan was still trying to devise a way to breach the layer of energy, Chu Feng found a gap in the crowd and easily slipped his way through.<br>Just as he had expected, he could pass through the barrier with ease.<br>What appeared before him afterward was another long corridor that looked similar to the one he had just passed through. It was dimly lit and its two sides were filled with paintings.<br>This time around, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t rush ahead. Instead, he took careful looks at the paintings along the way. While there were no clues on the paintings outside, he had a feeling that it might be different here.<br>He didn&rsquo;t notice anything from the paintings at the start, but he didn&rsquo;t give up and persisted on. Soon, his vigilance paid off.<br>He found a secret hidden in one of the paintings&mdash;the method to decipher the formation. Unfortunately, it was incomplete. It looked like he would have to find the other parts in the paintings along the way in order to piece together the complete deciphering method.<br>So, he persisted in his effort and continued observingthe paintings.<br>It was not easy. Only a small number of paintings contained parts of the deciphering method, and they were obscurely hidden. This meant that Chu Feng would have to carefully examine every single painting.<br>As a result, his progress slowed down significantly.<br>Meanwhile, the Situ World Spiritist Clan resorted to all ways to overcome the layer of energy, but it was all in vain. None of them, be it the elders or the juniors, were able to pass through the barrier.<br>&ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be. How did Bai Yunqing enter in the first place?&rdquo; the elders of the Situ World Spiritist Clan remarked indignantly.<br>&ldquo;There must be some clues in the energy that shrouded us earlier outside the ancient remnant. It&rsquo;s just that we weren&rsquo;t able to decipher it, resulting in this missed opportunity. My guess is that Bai Yunqing has figured something out with that compass of his, which is why he&rsquo;s the only one who is able to pass through the barrier,&rdquo; Situ Tingye said.<br>Being the grand elder of a powerful world spiritist clan, he was at least able to deduce as much.<br>&ldquo;Lord Grand Elder, what should we do? Are we going to hand the ancient remnant we have activated with much difficulty to an outsider just like that?&rdquo;<br>The elders of the Situ World Spiritist Clan were unwilling to accept such an outcome.<br>A cold glint flashed across Situ Tingye&rsquo;s eyes. He sent a discreet voice transmission to all of the God-cloak World Spiritists present here.<br>&ldquo;This ancient remnant was left behind by Lord Zhenlong, and it&rsquo;s almost certain that it contains his legacy.This legacy is very important to our Situ World Spiritist Clan; it&rsquo;s no exaggeration to say that this will dictate our fate.<br>&ldquo;Bai Yunqing might have a strong background, but he&rsquo;s likely to be here alone. People like them have no reason to move around discreetly; if there&rsquo;s anyone else with him, they would have already shown themselves.<br>&ldquo;This spells an opportunity for us. Bai Yunqing is the only one who can claim Lord Zhenlong&rsquo;s legacy, so we can leave that to him. However, the legacy must eventually fall into our hands,&rdquo; Situ Tingye said.<br>The other God-cloak World Spiritists revealed conflicted looks. They understood what Situ Tingye was getting at, but that was an extremely dangerous decision. It could possibly spell a calamity for them.<br>However, none of them tried to dissuade him from it. They knew that the Situ World Spiritist Clan was in a bad shape, and this legacy could very well be their only hope.<br>No matter how powerful Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s background was, they had to give it a try.<br>&hellip;<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng&rsquo;s progress had slowed significantly due to his clue-searching. He only took an hour to clear the first corridor, but he ended up spending ten hours on the subsequent one.<br>Fortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t in vain. He managed to acquire a complete deciphering method.<br>The deciphering method was a little peculiar as its effectiveness had nothing to do with one&rsquo;s spirit power. Instead, it was more dependent on the world spiritist&rsquo;s experience and skills.<br></p></div>
