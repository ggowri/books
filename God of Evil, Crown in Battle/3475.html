        <h1>Chapter 3474</h1>
        <div> - Child Chosen By The Heavens<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The gaze was moving through Chu Feng&rsquo;s body repeatedly. It was sizing him up.<br>At the same time, Chu Feng was able to sense a faint reaction from his Nine Dragons Saint Cloak. It was as if the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak had been summoned, and was becoming restless and uneasy.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>The lightning in the sky began to surge even more violently and the thunder grew more and more ear-piercing.<br>&ldquo;Snap~~~&rdquo;<br>Following that, a ray of lightning struck down from the sky. The lightning struck the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.<br>The twenty entrances of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound had been open the entire time. Should one wish to enter through them, one would be able to enter them at any time.<br>[1. It said thirty entrances before&hellip;]<br>Although the twenty hidden paths were ever-changing and completely unpredictable, the location of the entrances never changed.<br>The lightning bolts that were striking down from the sky nonstop were all striking the same place - the thirteenth hidden path&rsquo;s entrance.<br>After the lightning struck the ground, it turned into countless electric currents that flowed into the thirteenth hidden path&rsquo;s entrance.<br>The thirteenth hidden path&rsquo;s entrance did not receive any destruction at all. Instead, it was filled with lightning. Compared to the other nineteen entrances that did not undergo any change, the thirteenth entrance appeared very spectacular.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo;<br>The crowd looked to one another upon witnessing that spectacle. They began to make all sorts of guesses.<br>Suddenly, the Tantai Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief Tantai Xiangnan said, &ldquo;I get it now. That is the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound&rsquo;s abnormal sign.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound&rsquo;s abnormal sign? The Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound can have an abnormal sign?&rdquo; The great majority of the crowd were all very surprised, as they had never heard of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound possessing an abnormal sign before.<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Tantai, are you serious about what you just said? That really is the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound&rsquo;s abnormal sign?&rdquo; Wuming Ken asked.<br>&ldquo;Actually, matters regarding the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound&rsquo;s abnormal signs are merely hearsay for me too. I have never seen it before.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, in my grandfather&rsquo;s generation, people had indeed witnessed it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The last time the abnormal sign appeared, it was also accompanied by lightning striking an entrance of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound continuously. A total of nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine lightning bolts struck down upon that entrance,&rdquo; said Tantai Xiangnan.<br>&ldquo;Abnormal signs are usually a sort of sign. What does this abnormal sign represent?&rdquo; Wuming Ken asked.<br>&ldquo;There is a legend about this abnormal sign. According to the legend, the appearance of this abnormal sign means that someone selected by the heavens has appeared. This sign will guide the way for that heaven-selected individual,&rdquo; Tantai Xiangnan said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that the entrance struck by lightning is the entrance that leads to the depths of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm?&rdquo; The crowd became extremely excited.<br>However, Tantai Xiangnan shook his head. &ldquo;That is indeed what the rumors stated. However, according to my grandfather, this abnormal sign appeared more than once. In fact, he had heard from his seniors that when the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound was being looked after by our Tantai Heavenly Clan, this abnormal sign would appear frequently. However, the people that decided to enter the path indicated by the abnormal sign would never return.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, our clan&rsquo;s seniors later realized that the abnormal sign was indeed trying to show guidance. Merely, it is different from the legends. The guidance that it is showing is not guidance to the Nine Dragons Upper Realm&rsquo;s depths. Instead&hellip; it is warning everyone that the path it indicates is the hidden path of certain death,&rdquo; Tantai Xiangnan said.<br>&ldquo;Ah? It&rsquo;s actually that way?&rdquo; The crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed upon hearing those words.<br>Originally, the crowd were yearning to enter the entrance struck by the lightning. But now, alert and rejection had filled their minds.<br>Lightning was still striking down from the sky, and continued to strike at that entrance.<br>After a short period of time passed, the lightning finally stopped.<br>There were people among the crowd that were counting the exact number of lightning strikes. Thus, the crowd found out that the number of lightning strikes was exactly the same as Tantai Xiangnan had said. This also verified that the abnormal sign was indeed the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound&rsquo;s abnormal sign.<br>Following that, the lightning clouds that filled the sky began to dissipate. And the weather soon returned to normal.<br>As the crowd had already learned what that abnormal sign represented, they acted as if they had just witnessed a show, and were not very worried.<br>As the abnormal sign had indicated the most dangerous hidden path of certain death, the participants for the selection of the Ancestral Martial Decastars would be able to avoid dangers. This could be said to be a stroke of fortune.<br>However, right at that moment, Linghu Tiemian heard a voice transmission, &ldquo;Are you willing to allow Chu Feng to obtain first place?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Linghu Tiemian subconsciously turned to look at Tantai Xing&rsquo;er. That voice transmission was sent to him by her.<br>&ldquo;Why should that Chu Feng obtain first place?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if I cannot stop him, there&rsquo;s still Yueyue,&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian replied.<br>&ldquo;Have you not heard that Saint-cloak World Spiritists possess power on par with the Exalted realm? Chu Feng is a Saint-cloak World Spiritist. Not to mention you and I or Linghu Yueyue, even if all of us were to join hands, we would still not be a match for him,&rdquo; Tantai Xing&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian&rsquo;s expression changed slightly. Evidently, he had not heard of the strength of Saint-cloak World Spiritists. Thus, he did not believe Tantai Xing&rsquo;er. Yet, at the same time, he also felt slightly afraid. If what she said was true, they would really have no way to contend with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Where I learned it isn't important. What&rsquo;s important is that I am definitely not lying to you. You know me, lying to you will not benefit me at all,&rdquo; Tantai Xing&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s precisely because I know you that I will not trust you,&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian snorted coldly in a mocking manner.<br>Whilst others might not know what sort of person Tantai Xing&rsquo;er was, he was someone who had fought her many times. Thus, he knew her extremely well.<br>He knew very well how cunning and treacherous the woman was.<br>&ldquo;What if I am to tell you that you can eliminate that Chu Feng?&rdquo; Tantai Xing&rsquo;er asked.<br>This time around, Linghu Tiemian did not even bother to respond to her.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, then forget about it,&rdquo; she said.<br>Suddenly, Wuming Ken spoke loudly, &ldquo;Since the abnormal sign has subsided, let us continue with the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;All participants can now enter the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound and select the path you wish to take.&rdquo;<br>Once he finished saying those words, the ten people of the younger generation on the Apex Pillars and the hundred people of the younger generation that had managed to pass the first elimination round all set off, and entered the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.<br>Everyone had chosen to enter the hidden paths. No one was willing to go and challenge those Ancient Era&rsquo;s ferocious beasts.<br>This was the same for Tantai Xing&rsquo;er. Furthermore&hellip; she had finished selecting the entrance that she would take.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, a figure landed beside her, catching her attention.<br>Actually, many of the participants were people that wanted to gain from the chaos, and would follow the choices made by the people on the Apex Pillars, as they would then possess a certain amount of certainty for success.<br>As Tantai Xing&rsquo;er was someone from the Tantai Heavenly Clan, and everyone knew that the Tantai Heavenly Clan knew the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound the best, she had the most people following her.<br>The reason why the person who had landed beside her caught her attention was because that person was&hellip; Linghu Tiemian.<br>&ldquo;Tantai Xing&rsquo;er, could it be that&hellip; you have a way to handle Chu Feng?&rdquo; Linghu Tiemian asked Tantai Xing&rsquo;er using voice transmission.<br>Evidently, he was not only interested in her proposal, but also wanted to cooperate with her.<br>Thus, Tantai Xing&rsquo;er decided that she should stop trying to mystify things, and revealed her trump card. Using voice transmission, she said, &ldquo;Originally, I had planned to take care of him. However, judging from the situation now, taking care of him would not be enough. If you are to act right now, you will be able to directly kill him.&rdquo;<br></p></div>
