        <div> - Shaoyu&rsquo;s Return<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Xin&rsquo;er, why are you acting so hot-headed? This is unlike you,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandma spoke with a stern voice.<br>&ldquo;Lady Gusu, I was impetuous. Please punish me.&rdquo;<br>As Fumo Xin&rsquo;er spoke, she actually took a step back and half-knelt on the ground. It seemed like she was asking for forgiveness.<br>Both Long Ruiyun and Long Nanxun were stunned by this scene. At the same time, they grew even more afraid.<br>They did not know who the old lady that had suddenly appeared was.<br>But, they could tell from Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s reaction that the old lady was someone with a higher status and greater strength than hers.<br>But, exactly who were they?<br>As people from the Dragon Clan, they could be said to be very experienced and knowledgeable.<br>Yet, they&rsquo;d never seen or heard of those two people before.<br>At that moment, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandma noticed Long Ruiyun and Long Nanxun&rsquo;s gazes.<br>However, she didn&rsquo;t say anything about it. Instead, she extended her finger and gently pointed at their foreheads.<br>In the next instant, Long Ruiyun and Long Nanxun stood completely stunned. It was as if they were petrified.<br>Only after she finished doing this did Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandmother look to Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;You can rise. This is no crime at all,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandma said.<br>&ldquo;Thank you, Lady Gusu,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er bowed to express thanks before standing back up.<br>&ldquo;Lady Gusu, when did you return?&rdquo; asked Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just returned,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandma.<br>&ldquo;Has everything gone smoothly?&rdquo; asked Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;It has.&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandma smiled. Then, she said, &ldquo;Stop beating around the bush. Xin&rsquo;er, go ahead and say what you want to say.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip;.&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er started to hesitate. She hesitated for a while before finally saying, &ldquo;Lady Gusu, is it possible to not inform the young master about what happened here today?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I can do that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, Xin&rsquo;er, there is one thing that I need to tell you,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandma said.<br>&ldquo;Lady Gusu, please go ahead and tell Xin&rsquo;er what it is,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have possibly taken a fancy to that Chu Feng, right?&rdquo; asked Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandma.<br>&ldquo;No, Xin&rsquo;er wouldn&rsquo;t dare,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er shook her head repeatedly. But a flustered look appeared in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Xin&rsquo;er, I&rsquo;m thinking for your sake. You must not fall for that Chu Feng.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He is a man that you cannot fall for. Understand?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you end up falling for him, not even I will be able to help you,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandma.<br>&ldquo;Thank you for your reminder, Lady Gusu. Xin&rsquo;er will firmly remember it,&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er nodded repeatedly.<br>&ldquo;Well then, you can return. I&rsquo;ll handle things here,&rdquo; said Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandma.<br>&ldquo;Yes, Xin&rsquo;er understands.&rdquo;<br>After saying that, Fumo Xin&rsquo;er left obediently. She did not dare to stay.<br>As for Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandma, she waved her sleeve.<br>The movement of her sleeve did not give rise to any wind at all.<br>But, both Long Ruiyun and Long Nanxun, who were kneeling on the ground, suddenly stood up.<br>[1. I have no idea when they started kneeling either.]<br>Not only were they standing, but they&rsquo;d returned to the same posture as at the moment when they were chatting earlier.<br>&ldquo;Even ants have their way of life.&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandma sighed.<br>&ldquo;But, in every sort of community, mutual deception still exists.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I suppose this is human nature.&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandmother looked to Long Ruiyun and Long Nanxun and shook her head. Then, her body shifted, and she drifted away in the air.<br>After Fumo Xin&rsquo;er and her grandma left in succession, Long Nanxun and Long Ruiyun suddenly regained consciousness.<br>After regaining consciousness, the two of them looked at each other in dismay. They kept feeling like something was wrong, but they were unable to determine what was wrong.<br>&ldquo;Young master Nanxun, what were we talking about earlier?&rdquo; Long Ruiyun asked all of a sudden.<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip;&rdquo; Long Nanxun pondered for a bit before saying, &ldquo;Grandma Ruiyun, you seemed to be telling me that I need to consider things for my own good.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;<br>Long Ruiyan nodded. However, her expression soon took a huge change. She moved her hand to her hair.<br>&ldquo;Young master Nanxun, where&rsquo;s my coiling dragon hairpin?&rdquo; Long Ruiyun asked in great panic.<br>&ldquo;Hairpin?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t your hairpin on your head earlier?&rdquo; asked Long Nanxun.<br>&ldquo;Earlier?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How could it be?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It must&rsquo;ve fallen somewhere. Young master Nanxun, please help me search for it.&rdquo;<br>As Long Ruiyun spoke, she rushed out of the palace hall.<br>Seeing that, Long Nanxun immediately followed her.<br>The two of them began searching frantically for the hairpin.<br>Evidently, they no longer remembered Fumo Xin&rsquo;er appearing before them. They also did not remember Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s grandmother.<br>They didn&rsquo;t even remember how the hairpin had disappeared.<br>&hellip;...<br>At that moment, Fumo Shaoyu finally arrived at their arranged place.<br>But he did not return alone. He had brought a girl with him.<br>The girl did not have a stunning appearance, but she had a very pleasant and neat face.<br>Her skin was fair and her eyes clear. On her head was a simple long black ponytail.<br>Even her attire was very plain and simple.<br>She was a simple-looking girl. One would not feel particularly attracted to her from a single glance. But, she would not make one feel disgusted either. She belonged to the type that one would feel more comfortable with the more one looked at her.<br>Chu Feng and Fumo Xin&rsquo;er were very cheerful upon seeing Fumo Shaoyu&rsquo;s return.<br>They wanted to call out to him when the black-haired girl suddenly called out to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Are you really Chu Feng?&rdquo; asked the black-haired girl.<br>&ldquo;I am Chu Feng. Young lady, who might you be?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Before the girl could say anything else, Fumo Shaoyu pushed her aside. &ldquo;Young lady, if there&rsquo;s anything you want to say, you can wait till later.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Allow me to discuss proper business with brother Chu Feng first.&rdquo;<br>That girl was rather tactful. She did not say anything else, and began to examine Chu Feng. However, the more she examined him, the greater the disappointment in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;Hehe. Brother Chu Feng, I&rsquo;ve missed you to death.&rdquo;<br>Fumo Shaoyu gave Chu Feng a bear hug upon seeing him. Only then did he ask with a grinning smile, &ldquo;How was it? My little sister didn&rsquo;t cause you any inconvenience, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Did the two of you end up doing something immoral?&rdquo;<br>Fumo Shaoyu had a mischievous smile on his face.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, what nonsense are you spouting?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What immoral thing are you implying?&rdquo;<br>Fumo Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face immediately turned red upon hearing those words. She then glared fiercely at Fumo Shaoyu.<br>&ldquo;Immoral things mean something that is unsuitable to be said in public.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For example, eating together, drinking together and training together,&rdquo; Fumo Shaoyu said with a beaming smile.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s unsuitable about those things?&rdquo; Fumo Xin&rsquo;er stomped her foot angrily.<br>Seeing the relaxed look on Fumo Shaoyu's face, Chu Feng knew that nothing must&rsquo;ve happened to the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>But, Chu Feng was still worried about his clan. Thus, he still asked about it.<br>When Chu Feng asked him about his clan, Fumo Shaoyu became very pleased with himself.<br>&ldquo;Brother Chu Feng, with me handling things, there&rsquo;s nothing for you to worry about. I&rsquo;ve personally sought out a hiding place. Your clan has smoothly moved there now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I guarantee that no one will be able to find your clan. Even if they find them, there&rsquo;s nothing they can do.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;From now on, you can go ahead and do your things in the vast cultivation world without worries,&rdquo; said Fumo Shaoyu.<br></p></div>
