        <h1>Chapter 5214</h1>
        <div>: This Young Man Has Strong Parents<br>&ldquo;Perhaps Xue Ji doesn&rsquo;t know how formidable the Godsoul is,&rdquo; Chu Feng analyzed.<br>Not everyone was as knowledgeable as Tao Wu about this ancient remnant.<br>It was likely that even the Demon Spirit King and the two daoists were unaware of the true treasure here, let alone Xue Ji.<br>&ldquo;Even if she doesn&rsquo;t know that the ultimate treasure is a Godsoul and its uses, she should have been able to sense just how powerful the Godsoul is, as well as how useful it would be to a world spirit,&rdquo; Eggy refuted his point.<br>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Do you still remember me telling you that it&rsquo;d be good if there weren&rsquo;t that many Half-God level cultivators here?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;<br>There was no way Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t remember that. He sensed a fluctuation in Eggy&rsquo;s mood when she said those words and asked her what was wrong, but she refused to answer no matter how he probed her.<br>&ldquo;I knew from the very start that there&rsquo;s a treasure that&rsquo;s highly beneficial to world spirits in here. I have never felt such a strong attraction before. That&rsquo;s what led me to say those words. I was just worried that you would put your life on the line to acquire the treasure for me if I say it aloud, so I kept it from you,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng finally understood what was going on.<br>&ldquo;If I had sensed that, it would surely have been the same for Xue Ji too. She&rsquo;s only<br>slightly<br>weaker than me, after all,&rdquo; Eggy replied.<br>&ldquo;Xue Ji was able to sense the Godsoul too? In other words, she gave up despite vaguely knowing about the Godsoul&rsquo;s existence? That&rsquo;s a surprise,&rdquo; Chu Feng remarked.<br>In his perception, Xue Ji was a greedy person who was willing to put everything on the line for her own interests. It didn&rsquo;t make sense for her to miss something as valuable as the Godsoul. That was not the Xue Ji he knew.<br>&ldquo;Perhaps she isn&rsquo;t as bad as you think her out to be?&rdquo; Eggy said with a deep smile.<br>Chu Feng also fell into deep thoughts. He was unable to figure out Xue Ji either.<br>Jip jip jip.<br>Weird noises suddenly sounded.<br>Chu Feng turned his head over and saw that it was coming from Tao Wu&rsquo;s formation. The formation sealing off the Godsoul had already been unraveled, but for some reason, the formation Tao Wu entered was still active. To make things worse, it had started emanating an extremely dangerous aura.<br>&ldquo;Young brother Chu Feng, I am unable to leave the formation. Save me!&rdquo; Tao Wu screamed in pain.<br>Things didn&rsquo;t sound optimistic for him.<br>&ldquo;Calm down, elder. I&rsquo;ll save you right now!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng walked up to the formation, but he realized that it was no easy feat to save Tao Wu from it. He would have to use his own spirit power for it.<br>The problem was that he would have to dispel the imbued spirit power within him in order to use his own spirit power, and that would mean losing his peak Half-God level strength. That would make him utterly powerless against Daoist Eighth Dragon and Daoist Ninth Dragon if they somehow manage to get in here.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, I&rsquo;ll leave this place to you.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng meant that he would be counting on Eggy to protect them if anyone managed to get in here. He could sense strength comparable to a peak Half-God level cultivator from her.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m around. You can focus your attention on saving him. However, make sure to tread carefully and don&rsquo;t get hurt,&rdquo; Eggy reminded.<br>The truth was that Eggy didn&rsquo;t give a damn about Tao Wu&rsquo;s life and death. If she had a choice, she wouldn&rsquo;t want Chu Feng to get involved in this matter, especially when she could sense just how dangerous Tao Wu&rsquo;s formation was.<br>However, she knew Chu Feng too well to know that he wouldn&rsquo;t change his mind on this matter. Thus, her only option was to offer him her unconditional support.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng dispelled the spirit power imbued into him, causing him to revert back to his original strength. He quickly channeled his spirit power to shroud him and Tao Wu&rsquo;s formation.<br>The good news was that breaching the formation that Tao Wu was trapped in was more skill-based than power-based. In other words, the level of his spirit power didn&rsquo;t matter here.<br>However, the bad news was that breaching the formation proved to be much harder than he had expected. Even after having comprehended the legacy left behind by Yue Ling&rsquo;s ancestors, Chu Feng still found himself at a loss as to where he should start.<br>For the time being, he could only slow the formation&rsquo;s rate of deterioration so as to keep Tao Wu out of danger. However, this measure wouldn&rsquo;t work for long as it was extremely demanding on his spirit power. He had to find another solution before his spirit power ran out.<br>&hellip;<br>Meanwhile, a middle-aged man arrived at the entrance of the demon coffin. In his hand was a shattered bead that emanated the aura of the Ghost Spirit World.<br>&ldquo;The world spirit I sent in died. As expected, it&rsquo;s difficult for me to make any gains as long as they are there. Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t have taken this risk right from the start,&rdquo; the middle-aged man looked at the demon coffin and said.<br>This middle-aged man was no weakling&mdash;he was a fairly powerful Half-God level cultivator. On top of that, he was dressed in an extravagant world spiritist robe he wore that suggested that he was a world spiritist at his core, meaning that his spirit power was likely to be stronger than his martial power.<br>He was definitely not someone to be made light of.<br>He had reached the bottom of the demon coffin earlier and saw the three spirit formation gates. He cleared the trial and made it to the final cavern.<br>It was just that he stumbled upon the fight between the Demon Spirit King and the two daoists right after. He knew that he would be in danger if he barged in on their fight, so he decisively chose to back down there.<br>Unfortunately, his world spirit was unable to do the same, forcing him to patiently wait for his world spirit to return. After all, he had sent in his strongest world spirit with a unique bloodline to boost his odds of claiming the final treasure, so he wouldn&rsquo;t give up on it unless absolutely necessary.<br>However, just a moment ago, his world spirit&rsquo;s soul bead shattered, signaling that his world spirit had lost its life.<br>&ldquo;Haa, I was too optimistic thinking that everything might just somehow work out.&rdquo;<br>The middle-aged man let out a sorrowful sigh. He was upset that he had lost a formidable helper.<br>&ldquo;My wife, Hui&rsquo;er, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; the middle-aged man.<br>Standing behind the middle-aged man was a lady and a young man. The lady was dressed poshly, and this was accentuated by her disposition. She was likely to be an incredible beauty back in her time.<br>As for the young man, he would have been a familiar face if Chu Feng saw him. It was none other than the world spiritist who was outstanding in deciphering the blue rock&rsquo;s protective formation back in the cavern.<br>He had attempted to snatch Chu Feng&rsquo;s blue rocks, only to have the tables turned on him due to his weakness. Unwilling to accept the situation, he called the juniors of the Situ World Spiritist Clan over to stand up for him, but he could have never imagined that Chu Feng would be so brazen as to cripple their cultivation without any hesitation.<br>It was then that he realized that he was up against someone whom he couldn&rsquo;t defeat and immediately made his escape. Fortunately, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t pursue him.<br>That being said, he had no intention of letting Chu Feng off the hook just like that. The first thing he did upon reuniting with his parents was to tell them what had happened.<br>It turned out that he wasn&rsquo;t bragging when he said that his parents could back him up. That was also why he wasn&rsquo;t afraid of Chu Feng even after witnessing his strength.<br>&ldquo;Are we leaving just like that? Your son just got bullied by a bastard who came out of nowhere! How can we leave before getting rid of that bastard?&rdquo;<br>The lady took out a wanted poster&mdash;it was the one distributed by the Situ World Spiritist Clan declaring that Chu Feng was on their wanted list. She knew that the person on the poster had bullied her precious son, and her rage wouldn&rsquo;t be abated until she tore that man to shreds!<br></div>
