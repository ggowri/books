        <div> - Killing The Ferocious Beast<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Once this red gaseous substance appeared, it immediately caught the attention of the crowd present.<br>Not only did that enormous aura bring fear to the crowd, but even the sky had turned crimson.<br>It was as if a frightening existence were going to descend upon that place.<br>&ldquo;Run, run away!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, many of the people present started to scream in panic.<br>Apart from Chu Feng, everyone else started to rapidly flee.<br>This was especially true for those Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>While they had their powers restricted by Chu Feng, they were still members of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation. Thus, they began to order the others fleeing to bring them away.<br>As for those fleeing people, how could they possibly dare to go against the orders of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations? They immediately obeyed and brought the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations along.<br>&ldquo;It seems that girl did not deceive me.&rdquo;<br>At the moment when everyone was fleeing for their lives, Chu Feng revealed an excited expression.<br>Chu Feng was able to tell that the crimson gaseous substances were clearly gathering to form a huge monster.<br>Chu Feng involuntarily recalled the World Spirit Beast that Xia Yun&rsquo;er had mentioned.<br>Originally, Chu Feng had thought that Xia Yun&rsquo;er was lying to him. However, judging from the things happening before him now, Xia Yun&rsquo;er seemed to not have lied to him.<br>Merely, that World Spirit Beast seemed to have appeared a bit late.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, in the end, that red gaseous substance turned into a giant creature reaching a hundred meters tall and a thousand meters long.<br>That giant creature had an appearance resembling that of a rhinoceros. However, there were three horns on its head.<br>Furthermore, each and every one of those horns was extremely sharp and several tens of meters long.<br>That World Spirit Beast was completely different from all the World Spirit Beasts Chu Feng had encountered so far.<br>It did not show the slightest bit of fear after seeing Chu Feng. Instead, it revealed a murderous look, and immediately rushed forth to attack him.<br>While it was enormous, it was not clumsy at all. Its speed was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, it had arrived before Chu Feng.<br>It thrust forth its three horns at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Sensing that the situation was bad, Chu Feng immediately set up a defensive formation to block the incoming attack.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>However, after a loud explosion, Chu Feng&rsquo;s spirit formation shattered. Chu Feng was also directly struck by the three horns.<br>The three horns brought forth a massive shockwave and knocked Chu Feng flying straight into the sky.<br>Chu Feng only managed to stabilize himself after being knocked tens of thousands of meters away.<br>That said, while Chu Feng was struck by that World Spirit Beast, he was not injured.<br>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had set up a spirit formation over his own body. That spirit formation had successfully blocked that World Spirit Beast&rsquo;s attack.<br>&ldquo;This guy is pretty strong.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng stood in the sky. He did not descend to the ground immediately. He had discovered that the World Spirit Beast was stronger than he had anticipated it to be.<br>&ldquo;Taa, taa, taa~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, that World Spirit Beast stepped into the air and began to move toward Chu Feng one step at a time. That World Spirit Beast was actually capable of flying.<br>&ldquo;Come! I shall see exactly how powerful you are!&rdquo; Chu Feng shouted.<br>Then, he condensed a movement spirit formation beneath his feet and rushed to one side.<br>At the moment when Chu Feng was escaping from the World Spirit Beast, many slaughtering formations began to appear before Chu Feng nonstop. Then, they began to attack that World Spirit Beast.<br>At that moment, rumbles filled the sky. Energy ripples were radiating all around. Chu Feng and that World Spirit Beast were locked in battle.<br>&ldquo;Haha, that Chu Feng is out of luck. Never did I expect for there to actually be such a frightening thing here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That thing couldn&rsquo;t possibly be the pleasant surprise that the Immortal Armament Villa spoke of, right?&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, with the help from the others, had managed to distance themselves from the great battle between Chu Feng and that World Spirit Beast.<br>However, they were still able to hear the rumbles from the battle, as well as the frightening roars of that World Spirit Beast.<br>Those roars were so very frightening. It was as if they were capable of devouring even space itself.<br>They served to clearly illustrate how ferocious and powerful that World Spirit Beast was.<br>Thus, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations all felt that Chu Feng was toast.<br>&ldquo;Quickly, see how that Chu Feng is doing,&rdquo; the little pretty boy said to a woman among the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations.<br>After that little pretty boy spoke, the woman took out a mirror.<br>That mirror was very small. It was only the size of a fingernail.<br>That woman closed one of her eyes and opened the other wide.<br>When the woman placed the mirror before her open eye, the previously-ordinary mirror started to blossom with a peculiar light.<br>It turned out that the mirror was a treasure. It was capable of allowing its user to see far away.<br>Even though she was unable to use her martial power and her spirit power had been sealed, she was still able to use the mirror.<br>Furthermore, that little mirror was very effective. At the very least, with their current distance, she was able to see the situation of the battle between Chu Feng and that World Spirit Beast clearly.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>After that woman saw the situation of the battle, she immediately opened her mouth wide in shock.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening? How is it over there? Is that Chu Feng already being miserably tormented by that frightening thing?&rdquo; The pretty boy urged her for an answer.<br>At the same time, the other Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations also gathered around.<br>Expressions of anticipation filled their eyes and faces. They were all anticipating that Chu Feng would be defeated by that World Spirit Beast. Better yet, they hoped that Chu Feng would be directly killed by that World Spirit Beast.<br>&ldquo;That is a World Spirit Beast. It&rsquo;s enormous and very powerful. I have never seen a World Spirit Beast that powerful before,&rdquo; that woman said.<br>&ldquo;Haha, so the pleasant surprise is actually a frightening World Spirit Beast. That Chu Feng is going to suffer now.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Serves him right. This is what he gets for being so arrogant and conceited. Even we have all escaped from it. Yet, he decided to stay. Now he shall suffer the consequences of his actions.&rdquo;<br>After hearing what that woman said, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations all started to rejoice.<br>&ldquo;But, that Chu Feng has already managed to suppress that World Spirit Beast. Currently, that World Spirit Beast is in a disadvantageous position,&rdquo; the woman added.<br>&ldquo;What?! How could that be?! How could such a powerful World Spirit Beast be suppressed by that Chu Feng?!&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations all felt disbelief. Although they had already lost their martial power and spirit power, they were able to tell how frightening that crimson gaseous substance was merely by their intuition after seeing it.<br>The power emitted by that crimson gaseous substance was simply too strong. If they were able to use their martial power, they would be able to handle it.<br>However, if they were only limited to using their spirit power, they felt that not even Chu Xianshuo would be able to handle that thing.<br>An existence that not even Chu Xianshuo was capable of handling was actually being suppressed by Chu Feng. How could they possibly believe that?<br>&ldquo;There seems to be no sign of activity anymore. That World Spirit Beast couldn&rsquo;t possibly be really suppressed by that Chu Feng, right?&rdquo; said a Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generation.<br>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations noticed that the woman who was observing the situation with the mirror had turned completely pale. A complicated expression filled her face.<br>Seeing this, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations immediately asked her, &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That World Spirit Beast has already been killed by Chu Feng. Furthermore&hellip; after it died, it turned into a large amount of World Spirit Bones,&rdquo; that woman said.<br>&ldquo;A large amount of World Spirit Bones? How many?&rdquo; The others asked.<br>&ldquo;There should be over a million World Spirit Bones,&rdquo; That woman said.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations immediately opened their mouths wide in shock upon hearing those words.<br>Over a million World Spirit Bones. They knew very well what that signified.<br>That amount of World Spirit Bones was enough for one to obtain first place in this hunt. Even if all of the World Spirit Bones they possessed were added together, they would not be able to move that number in the slightest.<br><br><br></p></div>
