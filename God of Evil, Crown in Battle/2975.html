        <div> - What Sort Of Ability<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;However, nothing was at stake in that match. How about we have another match and add some stakes this time?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s naturally not an issue, it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m afraid of you,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan said in a very indifferent manner, &ldquo;How do you wish to compete?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Through a battle. The two of us shall fight. We can use both world spirit techniques and martial techniques to determine who among us is stronger, and who is weaker,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Once Chu Feng said those words, everyone&rsquo;s expressions turned sluggish.<br>They thought to themselves, &lsquo;Could this Chu Feng have gone insane or what? Earlier, he dared not say anything even after Chu Haoyan provoked and insulted him. Why would he go and provoke Chu Haoyan now?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;What makes him think he can provoke Chu Haoyan? Even if he&rsquo;s an Exalted-cloak World Spiritist, even if he ascended to the Heavenly Lightning Steps&rsquo; tenth step, even if he possesses heaven-defying secret skills and has trained in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, he is still&hellip; still only a rank five True Immortal, whereas Chu Haoyan is a rank seven True Immortal.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Regardless of how powerful a rank five True Immortal might be, how could a rank five True Immortal be able to contend against a rank seven True Immortal?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Furthermore, Chu Haoyan is not an ordinary rank seven True Immortal. He is someone who left his name on the Demon-level Geniuses List, one of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s strongest members of the younger generation.&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Even if Chu Feng possesses many heaven-defying abilities, Chu Haoyan also possesses many heaven-defying abilities.&rsquo;<br>No matter how they saw it, they felt that Chu Feng was simply seeking his own destruction by challenging Chu Haoyan.<br>In fact, it was not only the people of the younger generation that felt this way. After Chu Feng challenged Chu Haoyan, many of the older generations present also started to frown, and thought to themselves that Chu Feng was being too arrogant.<br>They all felt that Chu Feng&rsquo;s action was akin to a moth flying into a flame, seeking its own destruction.<br>Only Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s expression remained unchanged. In fact, he didn&rsquo;t say a word, but started to observe all of this with interest in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Haha, am I mishearing things, you really want to fight against me?&rdquo; Chu Haoyan started to laugh mockingly.<br>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mishear me. I am planning to fight against you. However, I have a condition,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Condition? Humph, I knew you wouldn't have the courage to fight me head-on. Go on, tell me your condition,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan spoke with contempt.<br>Chu Haoyan felt that Chu Feng would definitely bring forth a condition that was beneficial to Chu Feng and detrimental to himself.<br>However, Chu Haoyan didn&rsquo;t care. There were many people present, and not only people of the younger generation, but also many people of the older generation with prestige and status in the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>If Chu Feng was to bring up an unfair condition, the one to be humiliated would be Chu Feng. That was precisely what Chu Haoyan wanted to happen.<br>&ldquo;Fist and feet possess no eyes. If you are to injure me, even if you are to seriously injure me, I, Chu Feng, will have no complaints,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Chu Haoyan was baffled.<br>&lsquo;What is he talking about?&rsquo;<br>&lsquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he going to declare an unfair condition? Why would he say that he would not complain even if I am to seriously injure him? What sort of trick is this Chu Feng playing?&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, my condition is, if I end up seriously injuring you, I hope that you will not have any complaints either,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to Chu Haoyan.<br>&ldquo;What the fuck?!&rdquo; At that moment, Chu Haoyan cursed out loud.<br>After bursting out with a curse, he pointed at Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Who the hell do you think you are? You think you can injure me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sure, I accept your condition. Come, let us fight,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan said as he pointed at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so anxious just yet. We still haven&rsquo;t decided what the stakes will be,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Stakes? I&rsquo;d nearly forgotten about that. Very well, speak away, anything&rsquo;s fine with me,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan said.<br>&ldquo;If I, Chu Feng, am to lose, I will withdraw from training in the Nine Moons Sacred Domain,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;As for you&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng turned his hand that was pointing at Chu Haoyan to Chu Yue, who was standing and watching from afar, &ldquo;if you are to lose, you will hand your opportunity to train in the Nine Moons Sacred Domain to Chu Yue.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the crowd all turned their gazes to Chu Yue.<br>It was only at that moment that they realized that what Chu Lingxi declared earlier seemed to be true.<br>The reason why Chu Feng did not dare to fight Chu Haoyan head-on earlier in the palace was because of Chu Yue.<br>And now, the reason why Chu Feng had taken the initiative to fight against Chu Haoyan was also because of Chu Yue.<br>&ldquo;It turns out that you&rsquo;ve only challenged me because of her. This is truly what they mean by a hero will be angry for a beauty.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Chu Feng, you are no hero. You are only a fool. After all, it&rsquo;s simply impossible for you to defeat me,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan said as he pointed at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Do you find any issues with the conditions I&rsquo;ve put forth?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked in a very calm manner.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m already itching to teach you a lesson, arrogant fool,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, can we begin the match now?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Come, we can start right away,&rdquo; Chu Haoyan raised his arm and made a provoking motion, as if calling for Chu Feng to attack him.<br>At that moment, the surrounding people all moved backward. They formed an open space for Chu Feng and Chu Haoyan to fight.<br>At that moment, the people of the younger generation were a bit confused. They did not know if Chu Feng really possessed the ability to allow him to contend against Chu Haoyan, or if he was just acting like he was capable.<br>As for the experts from the older generation, they were shaking their heads. Practically all of them felt that Chu Feng was digging his own grave.<br>Only Chu Xuanzhengfa was watching all of this unfold with interest in his eyes.<br>"Milord, it seems you're not worried about Chu Feng in the slightest. Could it be that you think Chu Feng might be able to win?" Chu Xingde, who stood behind Chu Xuanzhengfa, asked in a very confused manner.<br>Following that, the members of the Law Enforcement Hall that stood around Chu Xuanzhengfa all turned their gazes toward him as well.<br>"Do not forget that he is Chu Xuanyuan's son. Furthermore, look at how confident he is. Does he resemble a reckless person?" Chu Xuanzhengfa asked.<br>"But, is that really possible? There's such a massive difference between their cultivations. No matter how many abilities one might possess, it would still be impossible to make up for it," Chu Xingde said.<br>"Do not judge a genius by the standards of commoners. As for Chu Feng, he is most definitely a genius," Chu Xuanzhengfa said.<br>Hearing those words, the people from the Law Enforcement Hall nodded.<br>So far, Chu Feng had truly accomplished many things ordinary people were incapable of accomplishing. He truly could not be considered an ordinary person.<br>"That said, exactly what sort of ability is he going to use to defeat Chu Haoyan, who is so much more powerful than him?" Chu Xingren asked.<br>"That is exactly what I want to know too," Chu Xuanzhengfa said with a smile.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa was very confident in Chu Feng. The only thing Chu Xuanzhengfa didn&rsquo;t know was exactly what other sort of ability Chu Feng possessed.<br>"Quickly, look, what is that?!"<br>"That... that's a World Spirit Gate?!"<br>Right at that moment, the crowd suddenly burst into an uproar.<br>The crowd were clearly able to see a World Spirit Gate opening before Chu Feng.<br><br><br></p></div>
