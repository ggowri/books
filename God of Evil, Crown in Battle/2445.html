        <div> - I&rsquo;ll Go Save Her<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>&ldquo;Brother-in-law, don&rsquo;t be like this. He is my savior. If it wasn&rsquo;t for him&hellip; I fear that I would not have been able to return.&rdquo;<br>In response, Zhan Lingtong hurriedly moved before Chu Feng and tried his best to defuse the situation. He was deeply afraid that his brother-in-law and Chu Feng would start fighting.<br>&ldquo;Lingtong, what did you just say? You&rsquo;re saying that you were captured by people from the Monstrous Clan?&rdquo;<br>Hearing what Zhan Lingtong said, his brother-in-law immediately had a change in expression. In a flash, the anger in his eyes lessened and was replaced with worry.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I never expected the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Monstrous Clan to be that tight in their patrol. I unfortunately ended up being captured by them and was sent to the mine as their slave miner.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fortunately, this benefactor here saved me. Else&hellip; I fear that I will have been worked to death in the mine,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law sighed.<br>&ldquo;Lingtong, it is not that I am trying to lecture you, but you are, no matter what, Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s biological son. Can&rsquo;t you show some future prospects?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Say, why did you dress yourself up as a commoner and then run out? What if something were to have really happened to you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For the sake of saving you, your older sister went against the opposition from Lord Clan Chief and the various elders to personally lead a group of people to search for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Perhaps you might be fine after returning. However, your older sister will have to undergo punishment upon her return,&rdquo; When mentioning this matter, Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law started to sigh repeatedly.<br>At that moment, both Chu Feng and Zhan Lingtong realized why Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law was so angry. It turned out, he was worried about his wife.<br>His actions were actually&hellip; quite pardonable.<br>&ldquo;Brother-in-law, I know that you&rsquo;re worried about my older sister. I am also worried about my older sister. But, you know very well how strong my older sister is. She is our Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s number one genius, and possesses the cultivation of a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor. She will definitely be fine,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I am reassured by your older sister&rsquo;s strength,&rdquo; Upon mentioning the cultivation of Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s older sister, his brother-in-law actually revealed a proud expression.<br>Zhan Lingtong was quite smart. Seeing that his brother-in-law had had a change in mood, he immediately said, &ldquo;Brother-in-law, I have endured great difficulty to bring Yue&rsquo;er back. This time, no matter what, I will definitely bring her to our clan. Else&hellip; I would rather leave the clan to be together with Yue&rsquo;er.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing I can do about you. However, I can only let you all enter. As to whether or not she can stay in the clan, it will be up to Lord Clan Chief to decide,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law said with a sigh.<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, everyone, come on out,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he waved his sleeve. Then, the space behind him started to wiggle.<br>In the blink of an eye, several tens of thousands of people appeared behind Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;<br>Witnessing such a scene, Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law and the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s guards all had an enormous change in expression. They were all stunned.<br>&ldquo;Brother-in-law, they are all pitiful people. If we are to disregard them, they will only be enslaved by the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Monstrous Clan. Can we shelter them?&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br>&ldquo;No, absolutely not!!!&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law said in a very determined manner.<br>&ldquo;Why not? These people here used to live in the territory of your Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan. In other words, they are your citizens.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When your citizens are met with disaster, are you all planning to watch with folded arms?&rdquo; Chu Feng was unable to look on anymore.<br>&ldquo;What do you know? This place here is the place where our Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan lives. This is a sacred land where ordinary commoners are not allowed to enter,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law said in a determined manner.<br>&ldquo;Sacred land? Did this sacred land manage to nurture a bunch of heartless, smug and self-righteous people like you all?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although I do not know much about the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan, I know with certainty that you all, the later generations, have completely disgraced the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan,&rdquo; Chu Feng mocked in a righteous manner.<br>&ldquo;What did you say? I dare you to say it again!&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law revealed a furious look.<br>At the same time, the guards behind him all drew their weapons. Evidently, what Chu Feng said had also enraged them.<br>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; Chu Feng snorted coldly. In Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes, these people were akin to a group of trash.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng felt that trash like them would definitely bully the weak and fear the strong. Thus, he would not lower his head to people like them, and would instead teach them a lesson. Only by teaching them a lesson would they respect and fear him.<br>Thus, Chu Feng and the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s clansmen could be said to be in a mutually hostile situation, ready to fight at any moment. This deeply worried Zhan Lingtong.<br>&ldquo;Milord, this is bad!&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, shouts were heard from afar. Soon, a figure appeared.<br>It was an Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan&rsquo;s clansman. Furthermore, his cultivation was quite decent; he was a rank six Half Martial Ancestor. However, at that moment, he was in a very weak state.<br>Not only were there many fresh wounds on his body, but his flesh was also burned. It was a very shocking sight. Moreover, his aura was exceptionally weak right now.<br>&ldquo;What is wrong? What happened? What about Lil&rsquo; Ling? Where&rsquo;s Lil&rsquo; Ling?&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing that person, Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law, as well as the others from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan immediately revealed expressions of panic. One by one, they rushed toward that man.<br>&ldquo;Milord, we encountered the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Yao Liutian. Lady Ling was captured by Yao Liutian.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fortunately Lady Ling used her treasure to protect me. Else&hellip; I fear that even I would not have been able to return alive,&rdquo; When mentioning this matter, that rank six Half Martial Ancestor started to shed silent tears.<br>&ldquo;What? Lil&rsquo; Ling, she, she was actually captured by Yao Liutian?&rdquo; Upon hearing those words, Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law&rsquo;s expression immediately turned ashen.<br>&ldquo;Big sister was actually captured?&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong had a similar expression to his brother-in-law.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng realized that the so-called Lil Ling must be Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s older sister.<br>She had unfortunately encountered the people from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Monstrous Clan while searching for Zhan Lingtong, and was captured by them.<br>&ldquo;Milord, what are we to do? That Yao Liutian is a rank one Martial Ancestor. Furthermore, he is someone who commits all sorts of imaginable misdeeds, and is lustful of our human race&rsquo;s females.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;With how beautiful Lady Ling is, for her to be captured by Yao Liutian, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that she&rsquo;ll be&hellip;?&rdquo; Someone spoke in a panic.<br>&ldquo;Shut up! You are not allowed to say that sort of thing!&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law spoke furiously.<br>&ldquo;Brother-in-law, that Yao Liutian&rsquo;s reputation is indeed extremely bad. We cannot afford to delay this matter. We must immediately go and save big sister,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br>&ldquo;That Yao Liutian is a rank one Martial Ancestor. Even if we are all to go, we will only be throwing away our lives,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law said.<br>&ldquo;Are we to disregard the life and death of my older sister then? She is your wife!&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br>&ldquo;Do you think that I&rsquo;m not worried about your sister? I am more worried about her than any of you. However, at times like this, we cannot make meaningless sacrifices.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will immediately return to the clan and report this matter to Lord Clan Chief,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law said.<br>&ldquo;But, will we make it in time?&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong said.<br>&ldquo;Even if we can&rsquo;t make it in time, there&rsquo;s nothing that can be done... This&hellip; this is the only way,&rdquo; After saying those words, Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law spoke to the man who had escaped alive, &ldquo;Do you know where Lil&rsquo; Ling and Yao Liutian are at right now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; That person nodded.<br>&ldquo;Come, follow me to see Lord Clan Chief,&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother in law grabbed that man. He planned to rush back into the Ancient Era&rsquo;s War Clan to report this matter.<br>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; However, right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly spoke.<br>&ldquo;What do you want now?&rdquo; Zhan Lingtong&rsquo;s brother-in-law was still burning with fury. He immediately unleashed overwhelming killing intent upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>However, Chu Feng completely ignored him. Instead, he turned to the man who had escaped and asked, &ldquo;Are there any other experts from the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Monstrous Clan at the place where that Yao Liutian is at right now?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t. He is the only Martial Ancestor level expert there. He must&rsquo;ve come out to capture women,&rdquo; That man replied.<br>&ldquo;Bring me there,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; At that moment, the expressions of everyone present changed enormously.<br>&ldquo;I said to bring me there. I&rsquo;ll go save her,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br><br></p></div>
