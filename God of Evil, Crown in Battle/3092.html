        <div> - Forbidden Mysteryrealm<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, hold this title plate and have it recognize you as its master. After that, enter that formation, and you&rsquo;ll be able to directly enter our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Forbidden Mysteryrealm in the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You will not be able to find the formation back to our Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Forbidden Mysteryrealm, however. The reason for that is because that formation is hidden.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, this old man will teach you a chant. By chanting it, you will be able to summon the formation hidden in the Forbidden Mysteryrealm and return here.&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief handed a title plate to Chu Feng.<br>That title plate was slightly special. Although it was said to be a title plate, it resembled an oval jade pendant. The jade pendant was light blue in color, and looked very clear. It seemed to be composed of water.<br>Following the directions given to him by the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Chu Feng began to imbue the title plate with his power. Immediately, the so-called title plate gave a response. Then, the title plate actually started to melt. Like water, it entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm.<br>It did not leave any sort of imprint after entering Chu Feng&rsquo;s palm. However, Chu Feng was able to tell that the power of the title plate had already fused with him.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng was delighted. He knew that he would from henceforth be able to go back and forth through the teleportation formation connecting the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm and the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm at will.<br>&ldquo;Senior, do you plan to accompany me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;The opening of the Upper Realm Gate has caused our clansmen to feel very uneasy. From today on, this old man will not be able to leave our Chu Heavenly Clan. I cannot even enter closed-door training. Thus, I will not be accompanying you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Moreover, there are a lot of your friends and family there. You will inevitably stay there for several days after seeing them again. If this old man is to accompany you, they will likely feel ill-at-ease,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng smiled. He had to admit that what the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said was correct.<br>Even though Chu Feng clearly knew that he was a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan, and belonged to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, in his heart, the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, the Nine Provinces Continent, that pebble-sized Azure Province by comparison, was his actual homeland.<br>Chu Feng had enormous sentimental feelings for that place. There were a lot of people Chu Feng were concerned for there.<br>Finally, Chu Feng would be able to see them again. The feelings he had for them was not something that could be expressed with a word or two.<br>Because of that, Chu Feng really did plan to stay for a while after returning this time around.<br>&ldquo;That said, Chu Feng, although this old man understands your frame of mind, I hope that you can return quickly, and not stay too long.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No matter how much you long to be there, the current you no longer belongs to that place.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;In fact, not even this Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm would be capable of keeping you. You belong to the vast world of martial cultivation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That mysterious and unknown vast starry sky shall become your arena,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said to Chu Feng sincerely and earnestly.<br>&ldquo;This junior understands senior&rsquo;s intention. I will definitely return quickly,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Very well. Go on ahead. This old man will wait for you here. When you return, this old man will have an important matter to discuss with you,&rdquo; the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart moved. He had a feeling that what the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was talking about was something extraordinary. The reason for that was because Chu Feng was able to hear the graveness of the subject from his tone.<br>That said, Chu Feng did not attempt to ask about it. Instead, he casually chatted with the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief for a bit longer, learned the chant for activating the title plate that had assimilated into his palm, and then stepped into the teleportation formation.<br>Using the title plate in his palm, Chu Feng began to activate the formation.<br>That grand formation was very powerful. It was also very fast.<br>In an instant, Chu Feng had been transferred away from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, and into the vast starry sky. His surroundings were rapidly flowing past. However, the distant stars were clearly visible to Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng knew that this formation was actually quite similar to the Stairway to Heaven. It had the same sort of function. The only difference was that the Stairway to Heaven lead upwards, whereas this formation lead downward.<br>After continuing the rapid descent for a while, Chu Feng&rsquo;s surroundings were no longer filled with stars. Instead, they had become rapidly flowing spirit power. Chu Feng was simply unable to see his surroundings at all. However, he was still capable of sensing that he was rapidly descending.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Finally, Chu Feng&rsquo;s body was set free from the restriction of the teleportation formation. He was once again capable of moving. At that moment, Chu Feng&rsquo;s vision had also become clear again.<br>Chu Feng was able to recognize where he was with a single glance.<br>That place was the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm. It was the Heavenly Road that connected the Eastern Sea Region to the Holy Land of Martialism.<br>This was the place where Chu Feng&rsquo;s father, Chu Xuanyuan, and the old ape were imprisoned, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s forbidden area, the Forbidden Mysteryrealm.<br>However, upon arriving there the excitement that had just appeared on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face immediately froze.<br>Chu Feng was dumbfounded. Upon closer inspection, he discovered that he had been locked out of the forbidden area. He was simply unable to enter deep into the forbidden area.<br>The reason for that was because there was a very powerful formation sealing it, locking Chu Feng out.<br>That formation was so powerful that Chu Feng was able to tell merely by looking at it that he would not be able to breach it. Not to mention him, it was likely not even their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would be able to breach the formation.<br>&ldquo;Is this&hellip; something my father set up?&rdquo; Chu Feng mumbled to himself. He was able to faintly feel a familiar aura from the formation. As for that aura&hellip; it was his father&rsquo;s aura.<br>&ldquo;Lord Father, it is I, Chu Feng. I have returned to see you,&rdquo; Chu Feng called.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice was very loud and clear. Unfortunately, even after he waited for quite a while, there was still no response.<br>With that, Chu Feng decided to call out several more times, with each call being louder than the last. In fact, he even ended up using his oppressive might later on. Unfortunately, there was no reaction. Neither inside or outside the formation.<br>&ldquo;What is this? Could it be that we&rsquo;re going to return empty-handed?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What the heck is your father doing? You&rsquo;ve gone through all those trials and tribulations to return here, yet he&rsquo;s actually refusing to see you?&rdquo; Seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s calls going unreturned, Her Lady Queen grew anxious.<br>As she had just found out the truth of what had happened back then, and discovered that Chu Feng&rsquo;s father had deceived him, Her Lady Queen was already feeling displeased with Chu Feng&rsquo;s father to begin with.<br>And now that Chu Feng had accomplished the mission his father had tasked him with, not only did he eradicate the Infant Soul Sect of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, but he also defeated all of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s younger generations; even the strongest member of the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s of the younger generation. All in order to receive the acknowledgement of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>However, after he had painstakingly finished all the missions his father had tasked him with, his father ended up refusing to see him. With this, Her Lady Queen would naturally feel very displeased.<br></p></div>
