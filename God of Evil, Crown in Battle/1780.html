        <div> - Publicly Snatching Away Another&rsquo;s Possessions<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;Do you know the disparity between you and me now?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Ximen Feixue, who had been seriously injured, instantly felt his blood boiling over. Then, a mouthful of blood sprayed out of his mouth.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>As the blood reached the ground, it began to emit hot steam. That was no ordinary blood. Rather, it was blood from anger.<br>Ximen Feixue was deeply angered. Chu Feng&rsquo;s words were like invisible blades that pierced deep into his heart, leaving behind a great amount of pain as they entered his ears.<br>&ldquo;Impossible! Your cultivation was below mine. How could you possibly obtain the same sort of cultivation as me this quickly?!&rdquo; Ximen Feixue showed an expression of disbelief. It was not that he really didn&rsquo;t believe in Chu Feng&rsquo;s current cultivation. Rather, he was unwilling to believe it. He was incapable of accepting the truth that Chu Feng had surpassed him.<br>&ldquo;Heh, didn&rsquo;t I tell you already? This is the disparity between you and me,&rdquo; As Chu Feng spoke, he extended his hand and made a grabbing motion. Then, a boundless suction energy shot forth. The Heavenly Immortal Sword in Ximen Feixue&rsquo;s hand, as well as the Cosmos Sack at his waist, were both sucked into Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>Seeing this scene, the people in the crowd were all startled. Not only did Chu Feng seriously injure Ximen Feixue, he also publicly snatched away his treasures. His actions were truly arrogant.<br>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Seeing that his treasures had been snatched away, Ximen Feixue became worried. Disregarding his injuries, he got back up and pounced at Chu Feng to try to take back his Heavenly Immortal Sword.<br>&ldquo;Scram,&rdquo; However, Chu Feng raised his leg and kicked Ximen Feixue away. His kick was so heavy that Ximen Feixue was knocked flying several tens of thousands of meters before ruthlessly falling onto the distant ground.<br>When he fell, Ximen Feixue&rsquo;s injuries became even more serious. At that time, he no longer had the strength to stand up again.<br>Ximen Feixue, who had been able to compete against Chu Feng in Mooncloud City back then, was currently absolutely no match for Chu Feng now.<br>&ldquo;It is one thing for your Four Great Imperial Clans to be despicable. However, you, Ximen Feixue, overestimated your own abilities and dared to publicly provoke me. Yet, I have only taken away your Heavenly Immortal Sword, and not your life. You should be thanking me for not killing you,&rdquo; Chu Feng waved the Heavenly Immortal Sword around and spoke with laughter.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, return my Heavenly Immortal Sword. You are not qualified to use the Heavenly Immortal Sword,&rdquo; Ximen Feixue shouted.<br>&ldquo;Use? While this Heavenly Immortal Sword is indeed quite decent, it is much inferior to my Evil God Sword. I never planned to use it. I merely planned to use it to exchange for some things,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a snicker.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re planning to sell off my Heavenly Immortal Sword?! Chu Feng, you are courting death! My Ximen Imperial Clan will definitely not let you get away with this!&rdquo; Ximen Feixue roared angrily.<br>&ldquo;You spoke as if your Ximen Imperial Clan would let me get away even if I didn&rsquo;t snatch your Heavenly Immortal Sword.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Currently, the entire Holy Land of Martialism knows of the behaviour of your Ximen Imperial Clan. Thus, you should stop trying to make an exhibition of yourself here,&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.<br>After he finished saying those words, Chu Feng turned around. Although Ximen Feixue continued to insult him, Chu Feng was disinclined to bother to take another glance at Ximen Feixue.<br>Indeed, Ximen Feixue had been capable of fighting against Chu Feng back then. However, from now on, Ximen Feixue would no longer be qualified to fight against Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;That Chu Feng is truly something.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;For Ximen Feixue to encounter him as his adversary, Ximen Feixue is truly unfortunate.&rdquo;<br>At this moment, the people on the various pagodas were all focused on this scene. Many people gave Chu Feng a high evaluation.<br>&ldquo;Humph, he should have used his lightnings that are capable of increasing his cultivation by two levels to reach rank seven Half Martial Emperor, right? If that&rsquo;s the case, you&rsquo;re still not the strongest here.&rdquo; However, at one pagoda, someone sneered mockingly.<br>This person was someone that Chu Feng had met before. He was the Weaponry Refinement Immortal&rsquo;s personal disciple, Baili Xinghe.<br>For some unknown reason, the gaze with which Baili Xinghe was looking at Chu Feng was filled with hostility.<br>&ldquo;Mn?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s perception was extremely sharp. With how strong the hostility present in Baili Xinghe&rsquo;s gaze was, Chu Feng was able to detect it right away. Involuntarily, Chu Feng turned his gaze toward the direction of the hostile gaze.<br>When he discovered that it was actually from Baili Xinghe&rsquo;s pagoda, Chu Feng&rsquo;s brows lifted slightly in surprise.<br>Chu Feng had met Baili Xinghe before on the Immortal Island. At that time, Baili Xinghe had been an enormously powerful genius to him. He had been much more powerful than Chu Feng and the others present on the Immortal Island.<br>After all, at that time, Chu Feng&rsquo;s cultivation, when compared to Baili Xinghe&rsquo;s from back then, had simply been incomparable.<br>As for now, although Baili Xinghe&rsquo;s cultivation had also increased, and he had reached rank seven Half Martial Emperor from rank five Half Martial Emperor in such a short period of time, he was still inferior to Chu Feng.<br>However, that was not important. The important matter was that Chu Feng did not possess any conflict with Baili Xinghe. Thus, he did not understand why Baili Xinghe would possess this enormous hostility toward him.<br>As for Baili Xinghe, when he saw that Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze had shifted to him, not only did the cold smile on his face not decrease, it instead increased.<br>Furthermore, a new implication appeared in his gaze of hostility. It was contempt. Not only was he hostile toward Chu Feng, he also did not place Chu Feng in his eyes. His gaze was filled with contempt.<br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip;&rdquo; Seeing Baili Xinghe acting this way, Chu Feng laughed lightly. Although he did not know why Baili Xinghe was this hostile toward him, Chu Feng was not afraid of him.<br>While he looked down on Chu Feng, he didn&rsquo;t know that Chu Feng also looked down on him.<br>Then, Chu Feng turned his gaze to the other pagodas. He wished to see the strength that his opponents possessed.<br>To his surprise, the people here were all more powerful than he had anticipated.<br>Firstly, there were four monstrous beast representatives from four monstrous beast clans. Their cultivations were the same. They were all rank six Half Martial Emperors.<br>According to Big Radish, of the Underworld Palace&rsquo;s three Underworld Messengers, Underworld Messenger Gui and Underworld Messenger Zhan possessed cultivations of rank six Half Martial Emperor, while Underworld Messenger Kuang possessed a cultivation of rank seven Half Martial Emperor.<br>However, at this moment, standing on their respective pagodas, Underworld Messenger Gui and Underworld Messenger Zhan possessed cultivations of rank seven Half Martial Emperors. As for Underworld Messenger Kuang, his cultivation was even stronger. He was a rank eight Half Martial Emperor. His cultivation was even stronger than Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>Compared to the Underworld palace, the three Feng Family Siblings were a bit weaker. The second brother and third sister of the three siblings were rank six Half Martial Emperors. Only the eldest brother, Feng Yihao, was a rank seven Half Martial Emperor.<br>However, the person that shocked Chu Feng the most was the strongest Heavenly General of the Heavenly Law Palace, the person who had reached the center of the fortress before him, Leng Yue.<br>Leng Yue was a cold and detached woman. Although she did not possess a stunning appearance, she gave off a very extraordinary air.<br>Most importantly, her cultivation was extremely powerful. Like the Underworld Palace&rsquo;s Underworld Messenger Kuang, she was also a rank eight Half Martial Emperor. However, she was different from Underworld Messenger Kuang; Leng Yue&rsquo;s aura was very extraordinary.<br>Chu Feng was able to faintly sense that Leng Yue might not have a heaven-defying battle power that surmounted three levels of cultivation. Instead, it was very likely that she possessed a heaven-defying battle power that surmounted four levels of cultivation. In other words&hellip; Leng Yue&rsquo;s battle power was likely as powerful as Chu Feng&rsquo;s.<br>&ldquo;It would seem that Leng Yue will be my strongest rival,&rdquo; After observing the crowd, Chu Feng placed Leng Yue as the person he needed to worry about the most.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, two figures suddenly descended from the sky and landed in front of Chu Feng.<br>They were two men. The two of them had identical appearances. Evidently, they were twins. Their cultivations were also not weak; they were both rank seven Half Martial Emperors.<br>The two of them were the other two Heavenly Generals from the Heavenly Law Palace.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, your name has been known to us for a long time. After seeing you today, your abilities are truly as extraordinary as they say.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After seeing your abilities earlier, we brothers have become a bit itchy. Might you be willing to spar with us?&rdquo; The two men from the Heavenly Law Palace spoke with beaming smiles. Although they were smiling, they actually possessed hidden malicious intentions. They were not planning to simply spar with Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Are you two challenging me?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile. Although the two men were powerful, Chu Feng did not place them in his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; The two men replied in unison.<br></p></div>
