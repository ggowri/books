        <div>: Another Name<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the Wretched Black Demon, a man who dared to snub even the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, kneeling in front of Master Yin Ren, Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s face paled in horror. She suddenly realized something.<br>Without any hesitation, she took out a talisman and invoked its teleportation power.<br>Pah!<br>However, an aged hand suddenly grabbed her wrist. It forcefully pumped a tremendous amount of spirit power into her wrist, disabling her teleportation formation.<br>&ldquo;Where are you heading to, Princess Xiaoxiao?&rdquo; Master Yin Ren asked with an unnerving smile.<br>&ldquo;Who in the world are you?&rdquo; Princess Xiaoxiao asked.<br>&ldquo;You need not be afraid, Princess Xiaoxiao. As long as you remain obedient, I won&rsquo;t do anything that&rsquo;ll harm you,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said.<br>He gathered yet another surge of spirit power and quickly constructed a formation to bind Princess Xiaoxiao, sealing off her spirit power and martial power. Even though he didn&rsquo;t tie her up, she was no different from a mortal at the moment.<br>In her current state, there was zero possibility of her escaping from Master Yin Ren.<br>After Master Yin Ren was done dealing with Princess Xiaoxiao, he turned to the Wretched Black Demon and asked, &ldquo;Did you obtain it?&rdquo;<br>Master Yin Ren didn&rsquo;t even allow the Wretched Black Demon to rise to his feet. He simply questioned the latter from a higher position, as if such were the natural positions between them.<br>Despite the Wretched Black Demon&rsquo;s notoriety, he was still nothing more than a servant to Master Yin Ren.<br>The Wretched Black Demon began sweating buckets upon hearing those words.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that you&rsquo;ve failed.&rdquo;<br>Fury blazed in Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s eyes.<br>The Wretched Black Demon quickly lowered his back and kowtowed desperately, saying, &ldquo;Milord, that old thing from the Zhuge Clan was simply too cunning! When he ordered his clan members to burn their life force, I thought that he was planning to make one last desperate struggle.<br>&ldquo;Yet, he actually invoked a teleportation formation instead! He sacrificed his entire clan just so that Zhuge Feiluan could get away! I&rsquo;m absolutely certain that the treasure is with Zhuge Feiluan right now.<br>&ldquo;However, there&rsquo;s no need to worry. The Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief isn&rsquo;t dead yet. If you interrogate him, he might just give away Zhuge Feiluan&rsquo;s whereabouts,&rdquo; the Wretched Black Demon said.<br>He took out a spherical formation and tossed it into the sky. The formation exploded in midair, and countless bodies appeared in the sky.<br>Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s breathing hastened out of fear. She could tell that those bodies belonged to those from the Zhuge Clan&hellip; just that they had all been reduced to corpses. Mutilated corpses.<br>There was one person who was still alive, and that was the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. It was just that he appeared to be in a state worse than his dead brethren.<br>The Wretched Black Demon pulled the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief into his hand and bellowed furiously, &ldquo;Old thing, you better tell us where Zhuge Feiluan has gone to!&rdquo;<br>The Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was in a feeble state, but he didn&rsquo;t pay any heed to the Wretched Black Demon. Instead, he turned his gaze toward Master Yin Ren.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; You are the masterminds?&rdquo;<br>The Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief grew agitated upon seeing Master Yin Ren and Princess Xiaoxiao. The truth was more than apparent to him, especially with the Wretched Black Demon kneeling on the ground.<br>&ldquo;Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, it looks like you&rsquo;re misunderstanding something. This has nothing to do with young friend Chu Feng or Princess Xiaoxiao, though you are right to say that I&rsquo;m the mastermind,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren replied.<br>&ldquo;You sure are brazen. Yin Ren, when have I done you any injustice? Why must you do this to my clan?&rdquo;<br>Despite the feeble voice of the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, one could still feel his burning anger.<br>&ldquo;Brother Zhuge, I really didn&rsquo;t expect such a brainless question to come from someone like you. If only you were willing to hand over the treasure, your Zhuge Clan could have been spared from this catastrophe. You&rsquo;re the one who brought this upon your own clan. You shouldn&rsquo;t be pointing your fingers at me.<br>&ldquo;How about this? Tell me where Zhuge Feiluan went. In exchange, I&rsquo;ll spare your life and help you rebuild your Zhuge Clan,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren walked over to the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s side and said.<br>&ldquo;Pui! You beast! Do your worst! If I let out even a cry, I&rsquo;ll renounce my identity as a member of the Zhuge Clan!&rdquo;<br>The Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spat at Master Yin Ren.<br>Master Yin Ren didn&rsquo;t dodge the spit, causing the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s saliva to slather on his face.<br>&ldquo;Haa. I&rsquo;ll never understand people like you. What&rsquo;s the point of putting on a brave front when you&rsquo;re already in such an utterly helpless position?&rdquo;<br>Master Yin Ren calmly wiped off the saliva on his face before placing his hand on the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s head.<br>Princess Xiaoxiao immediately turned her head away. She couldn&rsquo;t bear to see what was going to happen next.<br>However, something unexpected happened instead. Instead of killing the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Master Yin Ren started treating his injuries.<br>&ldquo;Milord, you are&hellip;?&rdquo;<br>Even the Wretched Black Demon looked at Master Yin Ren in confusion.<br>&ldquo;Useless fool. If he&rsquo;s willing to sacrifice his entire clan to help Zhuge Feiluan escape, how could he possibly be willing to divulge the latter&rsquo;s whereabouts? However, there&rsquo;s no need for us to search for Zhuge Feiluan. That child&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t look like a heartless person,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said.<br>&ldquo;You bastard, I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;<br>The Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief immediately figured out Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s plan. He garnered the entirety of his strength to lunge at Master Yin Ren, hoping to provoke the latter to kill him. It was just that he couldn&rsquo;t even muster the strength required for him to rise to his feet under Master Yin Ren&rsquo;s suppression.<br>&ldquo;Stop struggling. You should be praying right now. Pray hard that Zhuge Feiluan is a heartless person. That&rsquo;s the only way your Zhuge Clan can preserve its lineage,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said with a devious smile.<br>By this point, the condition of the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had stabilized to the point where he was no longer in danger of losing his life. However, his body was tightly trapped within a formation, such that he didn&rsquo;t even have the freedom to take his own life.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to teach you what you have to do, right?&rdquo; Master Yin Ren looked at the Wretched Black Demon and asked.<br>&ldquo;Milord, I&rsquo;m afraid that someone might stand up for the Zhuge Clan if I openly use this old thing&rsquo;s life to lure our Zhuge Feiluan,&rdquo; the Wretched Black Demon said.<br>&ldquo;Are you saying that you fear them more than me?&rdquo; Master Yin Ren asked with narrowed eyes.<br>&ldquo;Your humble servant dares not. Milord, I won&rsquo;t disappoint you.&rdquo;<br>The Wretched Black Demon quickly prostrated himself, and his body wouldn&rsquo;t stop trembling. He was extremely frightened of Master Yin Ren.<br>&ldquo;Wretched Black Demon, I have high hopes for you. Don&rsquo;t let me down again. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m afraid that I won&rsquo;t be able to save you when the poison in your body acts up again,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said.<br>&ldquo;Milord, please believe in my loyalty!&rdquo; the Wretched Black Demon cried out.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like people who are all talk. Go and find Zhuge Feiluan. As long as you obtain the treasure, I&rsquo;ll free you from the poison,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said.<br>&ldquo;Rest assured, Milord. I&rsquo;ll give it my all!&rdquo;<br>The eyes of the Wretched Black Demon visibly lit up upon hearing that he could be freed from his poison.<br>&ldquo;Go.&rdquo;<br>Master Yin Ren waved his hand.<br>The Wretched Black Demon quickly stowed away the Zhuge Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the corpses of the members of the Zhuge Clan before leaving the area.<br>With that, the only ones remaining in the area were Master Yin Ren and Princess XIaoxiao.<br>Looking at the foreign man standing before her, Princess Xiaoxiao asked once more, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I am someone whom your Nine Souls Sacred Clan used to look down on. I chose to tolerate the humiliation and quietly bide my time. I have another name other than Yin Ren, and that&rsquo;s my true identity,&rdquo; Master Yin Ren said.<br>To Princess Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s shock, he plucked out his right eyeball.<br>Bam!<br>As fresh blood spurted everywhere, a spirit formation gate surfaced in midair. The gate was translucent, allowing one to see what was going on within.<br>Within the spirit formation gate was a cage, and trapped within the cage was a man. The man was pinned onto a black formation wooden board by 136 special formation nails.<br>Princess Xiaoxiao didn&rsquo;t recognize this man, but Chu Feng would have surely been able to identify him right away.<br>That man was none other than Chu Feng&rsquo;s master, the Ox-nosed Old Daoist!<br></p></div>
