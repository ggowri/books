        <h1>Chapter 4207</h1>
        <div> - Such Ability<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the incoming attack, Long Shengbu immediately tried avoiding it.<br>Unfortunately, it was already too late. The spirit formation had arrived above him.<br>The spirit formation enveloped Long Shengbu. An enormous power was released from the spirit formation. That was an extremely destructive power.<br>Fortunately, Long Shengbu was very strong himself. Using his own power, he managed to barely resist the spirit formation.<br>Had it been someone else, even if it was that Elder Ruiyun, they would&rsquo;ve been obliterated by the spirit formation.<br>&ldquo;As expected of Long Shengbu, someone a step away from reaching Martial Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;My spirit formation was actually unable to kill you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, you shouldn&rsquo;t be so stubborn,&rdquo; said the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>&ldquo;All-seeing Heavenly Master, what is the meaning of this?!&rdquo; Elder Ruiyun asked angrily. As matters stood, everyone could tell that the All-seeing Heavenly Master harbored ulterior motives.<br>&ldquo;How can you not tell what my intentions are?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Long Ruiyun, you and I have only met several times. Did you really think you were qualified to request my aid? Did you really think I would be willing to help you solve this remnant left behind by Zhuge Yuankong?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truth is, someone has hired me for your lives. That is why I decided to help you all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that I never expected Long Shengbu to be so foolishly devoted as to follow Princess Xiaoxiao the entire time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I had thought that my plan would end in complete failure. But who would&rsquo;ve thought that the remnant from Zhuge Yuankong that you all brought me to would contain such power?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truly the heavens are helping me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even the heavens want you all to die here,&rdquo; said the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>&ldquo;You damned bitch, I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo; Elder Ruiyun shouted angrily after hearing those words. She released her peak Utmost Exalted-level martial power and charged to attack the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>As matters stood, she showed no sign of mercy at all. Her attack not only utilized the power of her Incomplete Exalted Armament, but it was also made using a fatal martial skill.<br>She knew very well that the All-seeing Heavenly Master was determined to kill them. Furthermore, she had grasped the power of the remnant that they were in.<br>If she failed to kill the All-seeing Heavenly Master, they would be the ones that ended up dead.<br>&ldquo;Wuuahh---&rdquo;<br>The All-seeing Heavenly Master merely waved her arm. Dark black gaseous flames that contained the power of the remnant&rsquo;s spirit formation were released from her sleeve.<br>The power of the spirit formation was earth-shattering and unstoppable.<br>Not only did it easily neutralize Elder Ruiyun&rsquo;s attack, it also flung her to the ground.<br>With only a single attack, Elder Ruiyun had fallen to the ground and was unable to stand up or move. She was already half-dead.<br>&ldquo;I know the person you want to kill us is because of me. Spare them. You can take my life,&rdquo; said Long Xiaoxiao.<br>However, after hearing those words, the All-seeing Heavenly Master burst into laughter.<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, do you take me for a fool? I&rsquo;m clearly capable of killing all four of you. Yet, you want me to spare them? You want me to release tigers back into the mountain?&rdquo;<br>A look of mockery filled the All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s eyes as she looked at Long Xiaoxiao.<br>Seeing that, Long Xiaoxiao narrowed her brows. She asked with a stern voice, &ldquo;Were the ones that hired you to kill me Long Mumu and her mother?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao, you&rsquo;re a clever person. Shouldn&rsquo;t you know very well who you&rsquo;ve offended in the Dragon Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why bother asking what you already know?&rdquo;<br>Although the All-seeing Heavenly Master did not directly answer Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s question, she has indirectly given her an answer.<br>The person that had hired the All-seeing Heavenly Master to kill them was none other than her older half-sister from the same father, Long Mumu.<br>&ldquo;So it was her.&rdquo;<br>A look of unwillingness appeared in Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s eyes.<br>She was furious and very unreconciled.<br>As matters stood, it was clear that she had thoroughly lost the battle.<br>&ldquo;All-seeing Heavenly Master, do you not know who Princess Xiaoxiao is?!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a furious shout was heard. It was Long Shengbu. &ldquo;She is the daughter of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief! If you dare do anything to her, even your master, the Dao Comprehension Sage Exalted, will not be able to save you!&rdquo;<br>Not only did Long Shengbu have a furious look on his face, he was also surging with killing intent.<br>If he wasn&rsquo;t being suppressed by the spirit formation and unable to get away, he would&rsquo;ve most definitely killed the All-seeing Heavenly Master already.<br>&ldquo;Long Shengbu, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Princess Xiaoxiao used to have status worthy of great respect. Unfortunately, her mother committed a major blunder.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Else, I wouldn&rsquo;t have dared attempt to take her life either.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, that&rsquo;s how your Dragon Clan is. Those who lose their power lose everything.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Even if Long Xiaoxiao dies, the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief would not investigate it. Besides, he would be well-aware of why Long Xiaoxiao died.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is your Dragon Clan, the cruel and cold-blooded clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Besides, no one will know that you all have died here today.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Those two brats will be able to bear witness to it. They can testify that I was never here.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, even if you all are to die here, it won't have anything to do with me.&rdquo;<br>A proud smile appeared on the All-seeing Heavenly Master&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve planned all of this!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Long Xiaoxiao came to a sudden realization.<br>In the beginning, they&rsquo;d agreed to explore the remnant together.<br>However, after arriving there, they hadn&rsquo;t seen the All-seeing Heavenly Master. Instead, they had received a letter.<br>The letter had been from the All-seeing Heavenly Master. The letter had stated that she was preoccupied with something, and could not come.<br>Chen Guang, Yue Yang and the two other rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritists had all seen the letter.<br>But, as she was in a rush to obtain the Triple Dragons Coiling Soul Lock, Long Xiaoxiao and the others did not delay the expedition, and had chosen to directly enter the remnant.<br>They had only entered the remnant for only a short while before Chen Guang and Yue Yang were attacked by spirit formations. Unable to proceed further, they were forced to withdraw from the remnant to treat their injuries.<br>After they left, the All-seeing Heavenly Master had suddenly arrived. Furthermore, she began helping them overcome the various crises they encountered.<br>Because of that, Long Xiaoxiao and the others had not only not been upset about the All-seeing Heavenly Master being late, but they were instead very grateful for her arrival.<br>Later on, another accident had occurred. The All-seeing Heavenly Master and the other two rank three Dragon Transformation Sensation world spiritists had gone to breach a spirit formation. But only the All-seeing Heavenly Master had returned.<br>The All-seeing Heavenly Master had told them that they had encountered a mishap whilst breaching the spirit formation and that the two world spiritists had ended up dying.<br>At that time, Long Xiaoxiao and others had firmly believed her words, and didn&rsquo;t think much of it.<br>However, after looking back at the situation, they realized that it had all been planned by the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br>It was very likely that even when Chen Guang and Yue Yang had suffered mishaps and were forced to withdraw, it had been caused by the All-seeing Heavenly Master. She had wanted them to return alive so that they could testify that she had never been to the remnant.<br>After all, the All-seeing Heavenly Master had only arrived after they'd left.<br>As for the deaths of the other two world spiritists, it had most definitely been caused by the All-seeing Heavenly Master.<br></p></div>
