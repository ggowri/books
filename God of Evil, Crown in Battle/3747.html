        <h1>Chapter 3746</h1>
        <div> - Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The battle between Yu Sha and Linghu Hongfei was very different from that of Chu Feng and Linghu Hongfei's.<br>When Chu Feng was fighting with Linghu Hongfei, the two of them were using all sorts of martial skills in nonstop succession. Not only were their attacks mighty and overwhelming, but they had also dazzled the crowd and made them gasp in amazement with their mastery of their martial skills.<br>Yu Sha, on the other hand, was different. All of her abilities were composed of black gaseous flames.<br>Regardless of how powerful her attacks might be, they were all dark black gaseous flames.<br>No matter how dazzling Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s attacks were, they were all stopped by the dark black gaseous flames.<br>One side of the sky was covered in golden light and all sorts of different powers. It was incomparably gorgeous.<br>As for the other side, it was composed of blazing black gaseous flames. The flames covered both the sky and the ground below, and were surging forth like countless evil spirits.<br>This seemed like a battle between God and the devil.<br>That said, the side that represented the devil was not the vicious, merciless and sinister Linghu Hongfei. Instead, it was Yu Sha.<br>The crowd&rsquo;s reactions were understandable too. After all, the auras of Asura World Spirits were closer to darkness.<br>In fact, the auras of Asura World Spirits were even more terrifying than that of Demon World Spirits.<br>The auras of Asura World Spirits were capable of raising fear from the bottom of one&rsquo;s heart. It was as if they represented evil itself.<br>&ldquo;It seems like that world spirit is truly too powerful.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder Chu Feng was able to tie with Linghu Hongfei that day. That world spirit is truly powerful.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, not only were the bystanders completely dumbstruck, but even Chu Lingxi was gasping with praises.<br>The reason for that was because all of the abilities that Linghu Hongfei used were perfectly subdued by Yu Sha.<br>The fight between the two of them was not leaning toward either side. They were at a complete draw.<br>It was exactly the same as the situation in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm that day.<br>&ldquo;Could it be that what happened in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm will occur again?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were feeling somewhat panicked seeing the match turning out like this.<br>This was especially true for the people that had witnessed the battle in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.<br>They were truly afraid that Linghu Hongfei and Chu Feng&rsquo;s world spirit would once again fight for ten days and nights.<br>&ldquo;Rooaarrr~~~&rdquo;<br>Following an ear-piercing roar, the sky was completely covered by darkness.<br>It was not simply black clouds. Instead, the entire region had fallen into darkness.<br>Most terrifying of all, a pair of giant eyes appeared in the dark black sky.<br>Not only were those eyes enormous in size, but they were also eerily empty.<br>That terrifying gaze came from the sky, and was shooting straight for the crowd. In the end, the gaze fixed onto Linghu Hongfei.<br>&ldquo;What is that? Could that be an ability from that world spirit?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What terrifying power!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is that the power of an Asura World Spirit?&rdquo;<br>When the crowd saw the transformation of the sky, they started feeling nervous. At the same time, they started to feel excitement.<br>They felt that the equilibrium in the battle might soon be destroyed, that the time to determine a winner had arrived.<br>After all, the might of the gaze in the sky was simply too powerful.<br>&ldquo;That girl actually held back the last time around?&rdquo;<br>Not to mention the others, even Chu Feng exclaimed in admiration upon seeing the transformation in the sky.<br>The atmosphere was truly akin to that of the arrival of doomsday. It seemed like everyone in the world would all be killed in the next instant.<br>That sort of oppressive sensation was something that even someone like Chu Feng found difficult to endure.<br>With the situation being like that, the crowd actually began to worry for Linghu Hongfei.<br>Even when Chu Feng was suppressing him earlier, the crowd did not think that he would lose.<br>However, now, the crowd actually felt that if Linghu Hongfei didn&rsquo;t reveal some sort of overwhelming ability, he might really be defeated.<br>After all, the might of the gaze in the sky was truly overwhelming, truly terrifying.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at the moment when the crowd were all worried, Linghu Hongfei began to emit a white light from his body.<br>After the white light appeared, Linghu Hongfei began to form hand seals. With that, a white mirror formed before him.<br>That white mirror did not appear to be anything special.<br>At the very least, in terms of imposing might, the mirror formed by Linghu Hongfei simply had a heaven and earth difference from Yu Sha&rsquo;s ability.<br>However, it was precisely this unremarkable mirror that brought great alarm to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Am I seeing things? Could that be&hellip; the strongest martial skill of the Linghu Heavenly Clan, the Vast Heavenly Lens?!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, cries of alarm sounded in the sky repeatedly.<br>The reason why the crowd was so astonished was because the Vast Heavenly Lens was not an ordinary martial skill. Instead, it was an Exalted Taboo Martial Skill.<br>Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens was the Linghu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s clan protection martial skill. It was also the strongest martial skill of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>In the Ancestral Martial Starfield, there were only an extremely small number of Exalted Taboo Martial Skills. For the great majority of the powers present, they simply did not possess a martial skill of that caliber.<br>Exalted Taboo Martial Skills were truly priceless treasures.<br>Most importantly, Exalted Taboo Martial Skills were not only extremely powerful, but they were also extremely difficult to learn.<br>Exactly how difficult was it to learn that Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens?<br>Its difficulty could be seen by the four Utmost Exalted-level Supreme Elders of the Linghu Heavenly Clan.<br>Of the four, only Linghu Yuhua and Linghu Wentai had managed to successfully learn the Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens.<br>As for the other two Supreme Elders, they had trained for many years, but were unable to successfully grasp that Exalted Taboo.<br>One must know that they were Utmost Exalted-level experts.<br>As Utmost Exalted-level experts, not only were they capable of controlling Utmost Exalted-level martial power, but their understanding and familiarity toward martial skills also far surpassed Exalted experts.<br>However, even existences like them were unable to learn that Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens. Yet, Linghu Hongfei had actually managed to learn it.<br>What did this mean? It meant that Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s talent had already surpassed the crowd&rsquo;s imagination.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lost.&rdquo;<br>After unleashing the Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens, confidence filled Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s face. He actually declared that Yu Sha had lost.<br>It could be seen that Linghu Hongfei was filled with confidence towards the Exalted Taboo: Vast Heavenly Lens.<br>&ldquo;Whether I win or lose can only be determined with strength.&rdquo;<br>Provoked by Linghu Hongfei, the uncommunicative Yu Sha actually spoke.<br>It would appear that she was truly enraged by his arrogance.<br>&ldquo;Paa~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Yu Sha clasped her palms.<br>The terrifying eyes in the sky disappeared.<br>When they reappeared, they were behind Yu Sha.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, the enormous eyes shot forth two streams of black gaseous flames. They were aimed straight at Linghu Hongfei.<br>Not only were the flames pitch black, but they were also emitting massive destructive power.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo;<br>However, faced with the terrifying black gaseous flames, Linghu Hongfei showed no panic at all. Instead, the corners of his mouth rose into a cold smile.<br>Then, Linghu Hongfei raised his arm, and the mirror before him immediately started trembling.<br>As it trembled, an enormous white image appeared above Linghu Hongfei.<br>The image was that of the mirror before him. Merely, the mirror was over a hundred thousand meters in diameter. It could be said that the mirror had completely covered the sky.<br>Following that, the enormous mirror actually shot out a white light straight towards Yu Sha.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>When the black gaseous flames arrived, the white light radiated all over.<br>The surroundings were separated into black and white!!!<br>The collision of black and white caused even the heaven and earth to tremble violently. Even though the oppressive might caused by the collision was blocked by the various experts present, and could not cause any harm to them, the oppressive might from the collision still swept out in all directions, causing many people of the younger generations to lose their footing and fall to the ground in an embarrassing state.<br></p></div>
