        <div> - Controlling Fate<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Pitiful person?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Milord, could it be that Li Yue&rsquo;er experienced something in her past?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Might you be willing to inform this junior about it?&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly asked concernedly upon hearing those words.<br>After all, Chu Feng and Li Yue&rsquo;er were friends. Thus, Chu Feng would naturally be concerned about Li Yue&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;Not only does Li Yue&rsquo;er possess a biological older brother called Li Ming, but she also possesses an older sister called Li Ruochu.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Li Ruochu was the oldest of the three siblings, and Li Yue&rsquo;er was the youngest.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, on the day Li Yue&rsquo;er was born, her parents ended up passing away.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, it was Li Ruochu who raised Li Ming and Li Yue&rsquo;er.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The three siblings have an extremely good relationship. Reportedly, Li Ruochu left for another Upper Realm to train when Li Yue&rsquo;er was five years old, and suddenly disappeared. From that point on, there has been no news from her at all. Because of that, people all say that she has died.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After their older sister disappeared, the two siblings no longer had any backing, and started receiving cold treatment from their clansmen.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Fortunately, Li Ming was a person with outstanding talent. Soon, he became a target for nurture by the Li Heavenly Clan. Li Ming did not fail to live up to the expectations placed upon him. Although he was very young, he became the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s number one person amongst the younger generations.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, heaven is jealous of heroic geniuses. In a training session, Li Ming unfortunately met his demise,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan said.<br>&ldquo;Li Ming died?&rdquo; Chu Feng was very shocked. He did not expect for Li Ming to have died.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Compared to Li Ruochu who had disappeared, Li Ming had truly died.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Li Ming&rsquo;s death came as a massive shock to Li Yue&rsquo;er. Like the final straw, his death overwhelmed her.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Reportedly, she has attempted suicide so as to be together with her older sister and brother multiple times,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan said.<br>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, that girl Li Yue&rsquo;er is truly pitiful,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen sighed.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; after knowing about Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s history, Chu Feng also felt very pained for her.<br>Compared to Li Yue&rsquo;er, Chu Feng felt that he was extremely fortunate.<br>Although Chu Feng was also not raised by his biological parents, his parents were, at the very least, still alive.<br>Yet, Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s parents died right after she was born. Furthermore, her older sister and older brother that she had relied on after her parents&rsquo; deaths also died in succession.<br>Moreover, a powerful clan like the Li Heavenly Clan most definitely had many factions. Likely, very few people in the clan truly considered Li Yue&rsquo;er to be their relative.<br>Since Li Yue&rsquo;er was raised by her older sister and older brother, it meant that Li Yue&rsquo;er did not possess any actual close relatives in the Li Heavenly Clan. Otherwise, there would be no reason for her older siblings to be the ones raising her.<br>It was no wonder that Li Yue&rsquo;er would not be able to endure the shock of her older siblings&rsquo; deaths, and decided to attempt suicide.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the rotation speed of the Upper Realm Gate started to slow down. Gradually, that Upper Realm Gate began to open.<br>&ldquo;The Li Heavenly Clan is not an enemy our Chu Heavenly Clan can defeat. This is truly a calamity for our clan.&rdquo;<br>Chu Youyuan turned his eyes upward again. Seeing the Upper Realm Gate that was soon to open, he sighed. His eyes were filled with melancholy and unease.<br>Then, he actually turned his eyes to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, perhaps the fate of our clan will lie in your hands.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; Chu Feng was startled upon hearing those words. Then, he asked, &ldquo;Lord Youyuan, what could I possibly do?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Reportedly, the Upper Realm Gate&rsquo;s opening happens gradually.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;During the initial stages of its opening, only the younger generation below a hundred years of age will be able to pass through it. Following that will be thousand year-old experts and then ten thousand year-old elderly cultivators.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, after that gate opens, you will be able to enter it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Reportedly, there is a formation inside the Upper Realm Gate. If one can destroy that formation, one will be able to slow down the Upper Realm Gate&rsquo;s opening speed.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although it will not be able to completely close the Upper Realm Gate, it will at least provide our Chu Heavenly Clan time to prepare.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, it seems to be the will of the heavens. The other side of the Upper Realm Gate is within the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s territory. I believe the Li Heavenly Clan will soon notice the Upper Realm Gate.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The Li Heavenly Clan also knows about the Upper Realm Gates very well. Likely, they will immediately dispatch their younger generations into the Upper Realm Gate. As for the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations, they are most definitely not people that our Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm&rsquo;s younger generations could possibly compare against.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, if you are to enter it, it would be extremely dangerous.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, are you willing to enter it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are not, this old man will definitely not force you,&rdquo; Chu Youyuan said to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Lord Youyuan, this junior is willing,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Chu Youyuan&rsquo;s eyes became fixed upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s answer. He was surprised.<br>Evidently, he had not expected Chu Feng to agree to it so frankly. He simply had no hesitation at all.<br>After all, their Chu Heavenly Clan had been extremely unfriendly toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, with the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s treatment towards you, you&rsquo;re still willing to brave dangers for the Chu Heavenly Clan?&rdquo; Chu Youyuan asked.<br>&ldquo;My father once said to me that no matter what, we still belong to the Chu Heavenly Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It is only a small portion of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s clansmen that hold hostility towards my father and I. It is not the Chu Heavenly Clan itself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Moreover, there are also people that truly care for me in the Chu Heavenly Clan. For example, there&rsquo;s senior Chu Xuanzhengfa and you, Lord Youyuan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, even if it&rsquo;s not for my own sake, for your sake, Lord Youyuan, for senior Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s sake, and for Chu Lingxi&rsquo;s sake, I, Chu Feng, will enter that Upper Realm Gate today,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>After hearing what Chu Feng said, Chu Youyuan became emotional.<br>&ldquo;To be able to distinguish between gratitude and grudges, you are a man of character.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, please accept this old man&rsquo;s respect,&rdquo; suddenly, Chu Youyuan knelt on the ground.<br>That person who was comparable to the Supreme Elders in the Chu Heavenly Clan was actually kowtowing to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Lord Youyuan, you must not do this. Please, quickly get up,&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly stepped forward. He wanted to pull Chu Youyuan back up.<br>Unfortunately, with a thought from Chu Youyuan, a barrier appeared before Chu Feng. Chu Feng was simply unable to approach Chu Youyuan, much less help him up.<br></p></div>
