        <h1>Chapter 4837</h1>
        <div>: Paying the Price<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng dived into the calamity like a fearless warrior.<br>The boundless calamity covered the entire sky. Even with Chu Feng&rsquo;s towering height of over ten thousand meters, he still couldn&rsquo;t help but appear insignificant before the calamity.<br>Gold sparks flashed in the sky, slicing through the violet lightning and driving the dark clouds back. It looked like a ferocious tiger had leaped into a pack of wolves.<br>The pack of wolves might have the numerical advantage, but they were unable to stand against the ferocious tiger at all.<br>Chu Feng was breaking down the terrifying calamity at an incredible speed.<br>Whoosh!<br>All of a sudden, a black aura seeped into the calamity and darted toward Chu Feng at a frightening speed.<br>Chu Feng noticed the black aura before it arrived and launched his attack. He swung his sword toward it, unleashing a golden sword ray toward the incoming attack.<br>This golden sword ray was stronger than anything Chu Feng had ever released. In fact, it was the strongest attack he could release even with the imbued power from the Hidden Dragon Heavenly God Formation.<br>He had noticed the danger coming from the black aura from the moment of its appearance, and that compelled him to release everything that he had.<br>The calamity might be terrifying in terms of prowess, but the black aura gave off an incredibly malevolent feeling.<br>It was a demonic creature.<br>Unfortunately, the black aura was even stronger than Chu Feng expected it to be. Despite his fast and decisive counterattack, the black aura was still able to dodge it with ease.<br>&ldquo;Ki ki ki!&rdquo;<br>Sinister laughter echoed in the air. It could only be heard by Chu Feng, but he could tell that it was coming from the black aura. The latter was showing its contempt for him.<br>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;<br>Knowing that things were going awry, Chu Feng quickly backed away while slashing the golden sword at the black aura. However, the black aura simply continued dodging the attack while chasing Chu Feng with unbelievable speed.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength was currently far above that of any other cultivator present. The crowd could only feel the imposing fight that was going on above them, but they weren&rsquo;t able to sense the exact happenings. They could only tell that the calamity was of no threat to them anymore.<br>It was only when the barrage of the golden sword rays finally came to a halt that the crowd managed to see Chu Feng once more.<br>Unease seeped into their eyes the moment they saw Chu Feng&rsquo;s silhouette.<br>Chu Feng was still standing amidst the calamity with a towering height over ten thousand meters, emanating a brilliant glow. However, there was a black aura coiled around his body.<br>This black aura was like a humongous python that held Chu Feng&rsquo;s body tightly in place, constantly tightening its grip on him. In response, there was a pained look on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is that the power of the calamity?&rdquo;<br>Fright slowly appeared on the faces of the elders and disciples present.<br>Despite Chu Feng&rsquo;s current powerful state, that black aura was still able to curb him. Just what kind of monster could that possibly be?<br>&ldquo;Focus your attention on driving the Hidden Dragon Heavenly God Formation!&rdquo; the sectmaster ordered with a bellow.<br>The elders and disciples had no choice but to heed her command.<br>Under the sectmaster's lead, the elders and disciples pumped even more energy into the formation.<br>Peng!<br>Peng!<br>Peng!<br>Loud rumbling echoed from the ground around them as new pillars of golden aura rushed into the sky like dragons. They fused into Chu Feng&rsquo;s body, seeking to aid him in his fight.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength began rising to an even higher level.<br>Whoosh!<br>The black aura wailed in agony. Its body began to shatter apart before finally dissipating before the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, good job! Focus your effort on breaking the calamity. Lord Sectmaster and the rest of us will support you!&rdquo;<br>Cheers sounded amidst the crowd upon seeing the dissipation of the black aura.<br>However, Chu Feng was feeling deeply unnerved at the moment.<br>Despite the reinforcement he had received from the Hidden Dragon Heavenly God Formation, he was still unable to fight against that bizarre black aura. In fact, the dissipation of the black aura had nothing to do with him at all.<br>It was the interference of another power!<br>There was another far more domineering power lingering in the calamity, and it was the one that destroyed the black aura.<br>It was just that the others weren&rsquo;t able to sense the presence of this domineering power, so they thought that Chu Feng was the one who defeated the black aura.<br>While the crowd was cheering for Chu Feng, the vice sectmaster&rsquo;s complexion turned horrible. He was the only one amongst them all who knew of the true identity of the black aura.<br>He never thought that the black aura would actually be this useless.<br>Boom!<br>Boom!<br>With the black aura gone, Chu Feng turned his attention back to unraveling the calamity.<br>It took him an hour in order to tear apart the dark clouds. There were still violet lightning bolts crackling here and there, but those were unable to put up a fight against Chu Feng anymore.<br>A blue sky had finally been returned to the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect.<br>The crowd felt the gloomy feeling in their hearts clearing up upon seeing the long-awaited blue sky.<br>The crowd was finally able to let loose a little from their tensed states.<br>However, Chu Feng still dared not to let his guard down. He continued tearing apart the calamity with every last bit of strength he had. He could sense the formation&rsquo;s energy slowly leaving his body, and that everyone else was about to reach their limits from driving the formation.<br>The calamity wasn&rsquo;t over yet. It had been weakened, but it was still a threat. He wanted to destroy it once and for all so as to ensure that there would be no mishaps.<br>But all of a sudden, the formation&rsquo;s energy suddenly began sapping from his body at a faster rate than before. At this rate, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to destroy all of the violet lightning bolts in time.<br>Soon, the golden aura fully dissipated, and Chu Feng reverted to his usual state.<br>&ldquo;Sectmaster!&rdquo;<br>Anxious shouts echoed from below.<br>Chu Feng quickly turned his gaze over, only to be shocked to see the sectmaster collapsing to the ground. Her complexion had started changing as well.<br>The sectmaster was definitely not young anymore, but she was still able to maintain her appearance as a middle-aged woman. Yet, within moments, her hair had gone completely white and wrinkles had started appearing all over her face.<br>Her hands and legs also started filling up with wrinkles and age spots as well. Large patches of her hair fell to the ground too.<br>The sectmaster looked like an elder who was already approaching the end of her life.<br>Chu Feng knew that the sectmaster had only fallen into such a state due to having overexerted herself in the Hidden Dragon Heavenly God Formation. She was basically the one controlling the full formation whereas the other disciples and elders were just supporting her, so she paid the greatest price of all.<br>That was also the reason why the formation&rsquo;s energy swiftly dissipated as soon as the sectmaster collapsed.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; the sectmaster reassured the crowd.<br>Her voice had turned old and hoarse too.<br>&ldquo;Master.&rdquo;<br>Zi Ling kneeled down beside the sectmaster and started tearing up.<br>The sectmaster was strict on her, but it was clear that she cared deeply for her. It pained her to see the sectmaster, who cared a lot about her appearance, turning into such a state.<br>Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t feel good about it either since the sectmaster had fallen into this state helping him break the calamity. No matter how the sectmaster usually treated him, she was the one who was leading the charge against the calamity today.<br>Boom!<br>Thunderous rumbling suddenly from above.<br>The blue sky was swiftly covered by dark clouds, and terrifying violet lightning swiftly enveloped the aerial space above.<br>The calamity had returned, and this time, it was stronger than before.<br>&ldquo;The calamity is back! Why would this happen?&rdquo;<br>The crowd despaired at that sight.<br></p></div>
