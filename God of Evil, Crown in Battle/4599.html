        <h1>Chapter 4598</h1>
        <div>: Come Here And Grab It<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The provocation that Chu Feng left behind riled up all of these prodigious world spiritists of the Nine Souls Galaxy. They cursed Chu Feng furiously, and there were even some who let out word that they would surely teach him a lesson as soon as he came out.<br>&ldquo;A bunch of useless fools. What&rsquo;s the point of barking here? Even someone from the Holy Light Galaxy was able to look down on you. You sure have thrown the face of our Nine Souls Galaxy!&rdquo;<br>The white-bearded old man looked at the juniors before him in contempt.<br>The current turn of affairs had surprisingly toughened the resolve of many of the juniors present. They began to report their names and entered the spirit formation gate one after another. Their goal was no other than to teach Chu Feng a lesson.<br>However, when the first junior world spiritist after Chu Feng entered the spirit formation gate, he found that Chu Feng was nowhere in sight. In fact, there was no one in the vicinity at all.<br>&ldquo;That coward flees right away after letting out his taunts. What a waste of my time!&rdquo; the junior world spiritist sneered as he turned around to leave.<br>To his shock, however, the spirit formation gate behind him had already disappeared without a trace.<br>For a moment there, he was stunned.<br>Thinking about it, even if Chu Feng had fled, the others who had entered before Chu Feng should still be lingering around the area. It was bizarre that none of them was around anymore.<br>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo;<br>All of a sudden, the junior world spiritist&rsquo;s face turned incredibly awful. He finally made sense of it all.<br>Beyond the spirit formation gate was indeed the Incubation Forest, but the spirit formation gate randomly teleported them to different areas in the Incubation Forest. It was not a fixed starting point.<br>This was the reason why there was no one around him.<br>Naturally, Chu Feng also noticed this as well, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but worry for Song Yun.<br>After all, Song Yun was still a child. Even if she really possessed the strength of a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, it would still be hard for her to survive in this treacherous environment.<br>It was really the worst-case scenario for them to be separated here.<br>So, Chu Feng began to look around for Song Yun&rsquo;s whereabouts. However, even after searching for an entire day, till the duration allocated for them to enter the Cloudmist Forest had already come to an end, he was still unable to find Song Yun anywhere.<br>On top of that, he stumbled on yet another problem.<br>The outer perimeter of the Cloudmist Forest had a barrier that prevented them from leaving the area. There was also another barrier in the core of the Cloudmist Forest that isolated the Incubation Forest away, limiting the area in which Chu Feng and the others could move around in.<br>That being said, the area which they could maneuver in was still incredibly huge. Nevertheless, Chu Feng felt that there had to be some sort of treasures inside the areas that were explicitly forbidden to them, or perhaps, there could be danger lurking there.<br>On top of that, even though they were here to compete with one another for the final three slots of the matchmaking convention, there were no instructions as to what they were supposed to do in this forest.<br>Due to that, Chu Feng deduced that the instructions would only be relayed to them once the spirit formation gate leading into the Cloudmist Forest was sealed.<br>&ldquo;Young friends that have traveled here from all over the galaxy, I&rsquo;m grateful for your presence here. However, if you wish to participate in Lord Black Demon&rsquo;s matchmaking convention for his daughter, you&rsquo;ll have to show some real skills.&rdquo;<br>Just as Chu Feng had expected, once the spirit formation gate was closed, a deep voice reverberated loudly from the sky above them. It was the voice of the white-bearded old man who recorded their names at the entrance.<br>The white-bearded old man began explaining the rules of the Cloudmist Forest to Chu Feng and everyone else.<br>First and foremost, there were two sections in the Cloudmist Forest, and all of the candidates were in the outer section. A day from now, anyone who was still in the outer section would be automatically teleported out of the Cloudmist Forest and deemed to have failed the selection.<br>In order to avoid being eliminated, they had to pass through the barrier before the deadline and enter the depths of the Incubation Forest.<br>Chu Feng had already noticed the barrier leading into the Incubation Forest, and honestly speaking, it was impossible to breach the barrier with his means, or in fact, the means of any of the juniors present in this forest.<br>Of course, since it was used as a trial, there was bound to be a solution here.<br>And the solution was actually pretty easy. In the sector where Chu Feng and the others were trapped, five different formations representing the Five Elements&mdash;metal, wood, water, fire, and earth&mdash;would appear randomly all around the place.<br>First and foremost, they would have to breach these formations and obtained their respective formation keys. Only a challenger who had gathered the keys of all five elements would be able to pass through the barrier and enter the inner section.<br>However, it was clear that this was only the first trial for the selections. It was likely that there was more to come after they entered the Incubation Forest.<br>As soon as the white-bearded old man ended his speech, the trial also officially commenced.<br>Everyone bringing forth their means to scan the area in search of the formations of Five Elements that were mentioned earlier. Chu Feng also did the same too.<br>He was anxious to look for Song Yun&rsquo;s whereabouts, but he couldn&rsquo;t miss the opportunity to obtain the formation keys too. So, he activated Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes and began scanning the area.<br>Soon, he found a white formation a distance away. It was in a concealed state, but it appeared as clear as day before Chu Feng&rsquo;s Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>This formation wasn&rsquo;t too big, standing at a height of 3 meters and a width of 5 meters. It looked like a translucent bowl placed upside down on the ground.<br>As it was possible to peer into the formation and look at its insides, Chu Feng was able to see a key with the word &lsquo;Metal&rsquo; floating inside.<br>He first observed the formation carefully before he started setting up a formation to breach it. It didn&rsquo;t take him long to overcome the formation and obtain the metal key.<br>It had barely been half an incense&rsquo;s time since the trial started to the point that Chu Feng obtained the key. Judging from this, he thought that he would be an easy feat for him to obtain the keys of all five elements.<br>(~ 7 minutes)<br>&ldquo;Brother, what fate we have with one another!&rdquo;<br>But as soon as Chu Feng obtained the key, he suddenly heard a voice behind him. A man with a devilish look on his face was currently standing on a tree branch in the distance.<br>Chu Feng recognized the man. He was the Little Demon King, Yin Tianchou.<br>While Chu Feng was focused on breaching the formation earlier, there was not a single instant that he had put down his guard. He was constantly releasing his spirit power to probe his surroundings.<br>Yet, he was actually oblivious to Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s presence. Had it not been for the latter calling out to him, he wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed the latter&rsquo;s existence!<br>This made Chu Feng realize that Yin Tianchou was definitely not an easy person to deal with.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re calling me?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Indeed. I don&rsquo;t like to beat around the bush, so I&rsquo;ll get straight to the point. I have a use for the key you just obtained, so give it to me.&rdquo;<br>Yin Tianchou directly revealed his intention.<br>&ldquo;My apologies, but it happens that I have a use for it too,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I know that it wasn&rsquo;t easy for you to obtain the key. How about this then? I&rsquo;ll trade it for this.&rdquo;<br>Yin Tianchou flung his sleeves and tossed a Cosmos Sack over. No, it wasn&rsquo;t a Cosmos Sack but an ordinary gunny sack. It was very small initially, but as it flew out of Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s sleeves, it swiftly expanded larger and larger.<br>As soon as the gunny sack landed on the ground, the lace sealing it undid itself, and a woman emerged from within.<br>This woman wasn&rsquo;t dressed properly, and her body was filled with glaring wounds.<br>&ldquo;How is it? This is a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, just like you and me. She&rsquo;s here to obtain something good out of the Incubation Forest. While she managed to fool those old fogeys outside with her disguise, she can&rsquo;t possibly fool my eyes!<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already had a taste of her, and she&rsquo;s not too bad. If you don&rsquo;t mind, why don&rsquo;t I exchange her for the key you have in hand?&rdquo; Yin Tianchou told Chu Feng with a repugnant smile.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes weren&rsquo;t on Yin Tianchou at the moment. He was looking at the woman inside the gunny sack. Her face was stained with tears, and she was continuously muttering two words weakly&hellip;<br>Save me.<br>Chu Feng could imagine just what kind of torture she had been put through just by her current appearance.<br>There was one thing that he couldn&rsquo;t stand in his life, and that was for guys to take advantage of girls.<br>Yin Tianchou had truly gone too far, committing such atrocities on this woman.<br>So, Chu Feng flung his sleeves and pulled the gunny sack over to his side. Then, he tossed a set of clothes and pill into the gunny sack and said, &ldquo;Heal yourself.&rdquo;<br>He wasn&rsquo;t looking at the gunny sack, but those words were clearly directed toward her.<br>&ldquo;Brother, you sure are kind to use a pill on her. But again, you can only truly savor her flavors after she recovers from her wounds. Well, I&rsquo;ll leave you to use her as you please, but for the time being, hand your key over to me.&rdquo;<br>Yin Tianchou assumed that Chu Feng had agreed to their deal, and he stretched his hand toward Chu Feng to urge him to fulfill the end of his bargain.<br>Yet, who could have thought that Chu Feng would place the key he had just obtained into his chest. He patted on the key through his clothes and told Yin Tianchou, &ldquo;Come take it if you can then, beast.&rdquo;<br>Those words immediately wiped away the smile from Yin Tianchou&rsquo;s face, and his expression turned eerily cold. Killing intent gushed out of his body, filling the area.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re courting death!&rdquo; Yin Tianchou spat.<br></p></div>
