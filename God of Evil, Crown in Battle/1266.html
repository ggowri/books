        <h1>Chapter 1266</h1>
        <div> - Headmaster&rsquo;s Enforcement Title Plate<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>As they journeyed toward the Boundless Green Sea, the number of people journeying to the Boundless Green Sea became more and more numerous. That was because today was the day of the dragon grade mission&rsquo;s opening, and no one wanted to miss the show.<br>Practically everyone wanted to experience the graceful bearing of the Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s strongest disciples. After all, it was very likely that those disciples would become the future management elders, and perhaps even the future headmaster, of the Cyanwood Mountain.<br>At this moment, there were people walking on the ground, people flying in the sky, and people who, for the sake of displaying their grandeur, were riding monstrous beasts.<br>However, the people who were riding monstrous beasts were truly only a small section. That was because they would end up being detested by the monstrous beast clans, and might even be attacked by them.<br>In a place like the Holy Land of Martialism, monstrous beasts were not small and weak existences. Due to their powerful monstrous beast bloodlines, they even occupied entire regions, becoming their overlords.<br>One such example would be Ben Leihu, not only did he become a disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain, he was also one of the existences on the Cyanwood Succession List. In the future, he would likely become a management elder.<br>Thus, to have humans tame monstrous beasts into mounts was something that all monstrous beasts viewed as an enormous humiliation. Whenever monstrous beasts encountered humans like those, they would generally not let them get away.<br>As for those people who dared to openly and publicly ride on monstrous beast mounts, none of them were ordinary existences. Generally, they would be cultivators that belonged to no school or sect but possessed very powerful strength.<br>Thus, even though there were countless hostile gazes from the monstrous beasts on them, those people did not fear in the slightest.<br>In fact, they even wanted the monstrous beasts to attack them, since if the monstrous beasts did attack first, they would have a chance to capture more monstrous beasts as pets.<br>However, regardless of how enormous the hatred might be, regardless of what sorts of motives they might have, no one dared to fight in this place. That was because they were participating in a grand occasion conducted by the Cyanwood Mountain.<br>The Cyanwood Mountain was the fully deserving overlord of the Cyanwood Domain. There was practically no party that dared to challenge them. Thus, even if there was hatred among the participants, they would have to wait until they left this place before they could settle their disputes in private. Very rarely would anyone dare to fight at this place and provoke the baseline of the Cyanwood Mountain.<br>At this moment, Chu Feng and the others were rapidly flying in the sky. However, even though countless figures were passing them by, no one was able to see them.<br>That was because Half Martial Emperor White Ape had used a concealing technique that made it so that ordinary people could not see them at all. As for why Half Martial Emperor White Ape did this, it might have been because he didn&rsquo;t want to raise an unnecessary commotion, or perhaps it might be the method that experts used to act pretentiously, so that they could amaze everyone later on by appearing confidently when no one expected them.<br>&ldquo;Woosh.&rdquo;<br>However, as Half Martial Emperor White Ape was leading Chu Feng and the others and peacefully journeying toward the Boundless Green Sea, a figure suddenly appeared before them and blocked their path.<br>This person had also used a concealing technique that made it so that ordinary people could not see him. However, he had released his concealing technique to Chu Feng and the others, allowing them to see his appearance.<br>He was an old man. Not only did he have a very fierce appearance, he was also emitting a very dense killing intent. Even though he had a smile on his face, it was impossible for it to conceal his cruel nature.<br>This old man was extremely powerful, so powerful that it was difficult to describe his strength. At the very least, his aura was not at all inferior to Half Martial Emperor White Ape and Bai Suyan; he was an unfathomable super expert.<br>When Chu Feng and the others saw the Punishment Blade on his waist, they managed to easily guess this person&rsquo;s identity. He was precisely the head of the Punishment Department, Crazed Killer Tuoba.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, this is the first time that we are meeting each other. Allow me to introduce myself, I am the head of the Punishment Department, Crazed Killer Tuoba,&rdquo; Sure enough, Crazed Killer Tuoba introduced himself to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Since your arrival, your days in the Cyanwood Mountain have never been smooth and steady. Even though you have not yet violated the laws and decrees of the Cyanwood Mountain, I must warn you that it would be best for you to not do anything that would violate the Cyanwood Mountain&rsquo;s laws. Else, I will definitely not let you get away easily,&rdquo; However, Crazed Killer Tuoba not only introduced himself, he also gave Chu Feng a stern warning. His attitude was extremely vile.<br>Suddenly, Half Martial Emperor White Ape spoke. &ldquo;Crazed Killer Tuoba, there is no need for you to be concerned about what Chu Feng plans to do. What you should be concerned about right now should be yourself,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Oh? Concern about myself? I truly do not know what is it that I need to be concerned about. White Ape, how about you tell me what it is that I need to be concerned about?&rdquo; Crazed Killer Tuoba smiled coldly. The gaze with which he looked to Half Martial Emperor White Ape was filled with ill-intent and disdain.<br>&ldquo;As the head of the Punishment Department, you, without permission from the Lord Headmaster, decided to punish the head of the Medicine Concocting Department. This is something that is against the laws of the Cyanwood Mountain.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You, as the head of the Punishment Department, decided to consciously go against the rules. That, in and of itself, is a serious crime!&rdquo; Half Martial Emperor White Ape spoke those words one by one.<br>&ldquo;White Ape, you can skip trying to use this method on me. If Lord Headmaster were present, I would naturally report the matter to him. However, Lord Headmaster is in closed-door training right now. As such, how could I possibly go and bother him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, both you and I are aware that Hong Mo, as a management elder, has willfully beat up the core disciples of our Cyanwood Mountain, nearly killing them in the process. That in itself is also a serious crime. Even if Lord Headmaster were here, he too would severely punish him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As Lord Headmaster is not present, I, as the head of the Punishment Department, possess the authority to carry out punishment on his behalf. I have merely done what I should do as the Punishment Department&rsquo;s head, so how could it possibly be considered to be a serious crime?&rdquo; Crazed Killer Tuoba refuted White Ape loudly. His attitude was extremely oppressive.<br>&ldquo;While it is true that Lord Headmaster is in closed-door training, I presume that he must&rsquo;ve told you before he entered his closed-door training that I am to act as his proxy during the time he is in closed-door training. As such, you should have waited for my return and reported the matter to me before doing anything,&rdquo; Half Martial Emperor White Ape said. His attitude was extremely calm.<br>&ldquo;Haha, White Ape, you truly overvalue yourself. Report to you? Who do you think you are? Did you truly think that, with Lord Headmaster in closed-door training, you&rsquo;ve become the acting headmaster of our Cyanwood Mountain?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To speak frankly, before Lord Headmaster entered his closed-door training, he indeed mentioned to me to have you manage the Cyanwood Mountain. However, what he said to me was not to have me follow your orders, but for the two of us to manage the Cyanwood Mountain together.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Currently, both you and I are on equal footing. As such, why should I report to you? Do you even possess the qualifications for me to do that?&rdquo; Crazed Killer Tuoba said coldly.<br>&ldquo;Oh? Crazed Killer Tuoba, are you certain about what you just said?&rdquo; Faced with Crazed Killer Tuoba&rsquo;s insulting words, Half Martial Emperor White Ape lightly smiled. As he spoke, he flipped his palm and took out a cyan-green colored wooden title plate and held it in his hand.<br>&ldquo;That is, that, that, that&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; When Crazed Killer Tuoba saw the title plate in Half Martial Emperor White Ape&rsquo;s hand, his eyes suddenly shone, and his expression took a huge change.<br>Seeing his reaction, Chu Feng and the others also shifted their gazes to the cyan-green colored wooden title plate. Only then did they discover that while the title plate appeared to be ordinary, it was actually a treasure. Furthermore, four large characters were written on this title plate, &lsquo;Headmaster&rsquo;s Enforcement Title Plate.&rsquo;<br>&ldquo;Impossible, this is impossible! How could you possibly have the Headmaster&rsquo;s Enforcement Title Plate? That is the title plate that only Lord Headmaster possesses!&rdquo; At this moment, Crazed Killer&rsquo;s expression was extremely ugly. His previous arrogance turned to enormous shock. He was incapable of accepting this fact.<br></p></div>
