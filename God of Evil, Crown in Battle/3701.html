        <div> - Reaching The Mirror Sea<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, perhaps you do not know what the Mirror Sea is. That place is extremely dangerous. You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Chu Hanpeng hurriedly spoke to dissuade Chu Feng. He did not want him to take on such risks.<br>However, before he could finish his words, Chu Feng interrupted, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to bother explaining. I know what kind of place it is.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the crowd all turned to each other. Complicated emotions filled their faces.<br>They had originally thought that Chu Feng was not afraid of the Mirror Sea because he didn&rsquo;t know what sort of place it was.<br>However, he told them that he actually knew what sort of place it was. This meant that Chu Feng had really decided to brave such danger.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng turned to Grandmaster Liangqiu. &ldquo;Grandmaster, how much longer can Lingxi last?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I have used my full strength to help her extend the time her soul can be restored.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, even with that, she will at most last seven more days. After seven days pass, even gods would not be able to save her,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;What? Seven days? Such a short period of time?&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clansmen all started to despair.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa was unable to even stand firm. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Chu Feng supporting him, he would&rsquo;ve directly fallen to the ground.<br>They all knew what sort of place the Mirror Sea was. They knew that it was not close to the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm at all. Even if they were to use Ancient Era&rsquo;s Teleportation Formations and treasures to increase their speed, it would take at least fifteen days to arrive at the Mirror Sea.<br>However, seven days was all the time they were given. WIthout a doubt, this served as a judgement of death upon Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Heavens! Could it be that you&rsquo;re really planning to take away Lingxi&rsquo;s eyes?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to even give us a chance?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Exactly what wrong have I done? If you want to punish me, go and punish me. Please spare Lingxi!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Xuanzhengfa&rsquo;s manly face was covered in tears.<br>Holding Chu Xuanzhengfa, Chu Feng was able to tell that he was trembling violently. He was in a state of utter despair. He was in so much despair that he was already close to collapsing.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, if you want to go, this old man can accompany you. This old man has a boat. If we are to use that boat and enter the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Teleportation Formations with it, we could cut the time down to five days,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster, truly?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, truly?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa asked in unison upon hearing those words.<br>They seemed like two people who had fallen into the abyss suddenly discovering a way out.<br>&ldquo;If we set off right now, we will definitely arrive within five days,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>&ldquo;Senior, in that case, let us set off right now.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he rushed into the palace hall and carried Chu Lingxi out.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come too.&rdquo; Chu Xuanzhengfa got up.<br>Chu Xuanzhengfa, who was so weak that he could not even stand firm earlier, became particularly spirited.<br>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Grandmaster Liangqiu nodded. Then, he looked to Liangqiu Chengfeng. &ldquo;Liangqiu Chengfeng, so as to avoid anything happening in the Chu Heavenly Clan, you&rsquo;ll stay here.&rdquo;<br>Knowing the current situation well, Liangqiu Chengfeng naturally agreed to it.<br>Then, Grandmaster Liangqiu, Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa left for the Mirror Sea, bringing Chu Lingxi with them.<br>Thanks to Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s boat that was able to increase their speed in the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Teleportation Formations, they really managed to arrive in the Lonesome Upper Realm in five days&rsquo; time.<br>The Ancient Era&rsquo;s Teleportation Formation that connected to the Lonesome Upper Realm was located in midair.<br>Thus, after they walked out of the teleportation formation, their ears were immediately met with the sound of crashing waves. When they raised their heads, they saw surging black clouds and pouring rain.<br>What was below them was naturally the legendary eccentric&rsquo;s remnant, the Mirror Sea.<br>Black clouds covered an area of several tens of thousands of miles.<br>Torrential rain filled every inch of space. The sound of the crashing waves was so ear-piercing that it sounded like the roars of millions of ferocious beasts.<br>However, the Mirror Sea that was below them, the Mirror Sea that was renowned for its dangers, was completely tranquil, with its surface so calm it resembled a mirror.<br>Even the pouring torrential rain was unable to cause a splash on the surface of the sea. The sea was strangely tranquil.<br>Seemingly realizing Chu Feng&rsquo;s confusion, Grandmaster Liangqiu explained it to him.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Mirror Sea. Although it appears to be extremely tranquil, the insides are filled with waves as sharp as blades. Upon entering the Mirror Sea, those with cultivations below Martial Immortal will all be forcibly torn to pieces by the waves inside the sea. As for Martial Immortals, they would also be riddled with wounds. However, that is only the result should they immediately break away from the Mirror Sea upon entering it&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The longer one stays in the Mirror Sea, the more serious the injuries one will receive. If one were to penetrate deep into the sea, it would be akin to entering the netherworld. The further one goes into the sea, the closer one will be to death.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Till this date, there has never been anyone that was able to enter the depths of the Mirror Sea.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Not even your grandfather and father were able to reach the depths of the Mirror Sea.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is the reason why the Mirror Sea is known to be the most dangerous place in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, and the hardest of all the Eccentrics&rsquo; Remnants.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, since you know about the Deepsea Pupils, do you know their precise location?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>Perhaps others might attempt to enter the Mirror Sea for the sake of obtaining the legendary weapon located in the depths of the Mirror Sea...<br>&hellip;the Battle God&rsquo;s Halberd!!!<br>Chu Feng was different. He was there because he wanted to obtain the Deepsea Pupils that could help Chu Lingxi recover her vision.<br>Earlier, Chu Feng had inspected the Mirror Sea with his Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes. Unfortunately, the result was not very hopeful.<br>He was unable to detect anything at all. The Mirror Sea was very different from his imagination, and was much more unfathomable.<br>Thus, Chu Feng could only ask Grandmaster Liangqiu for guidance.<br>&ldquo;I have an old friend who is extremely interested in the Mirror Sea, and has been staying here year-round to study it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He once saw the Deepsea Pupils with his own eyes. Thus, I will need to go and ask him where the Deepsea Pupils are.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;His residence is not far from this place. Merely, he travels throughout the Mirror Sea year-round. Thus, I do not know if he&rsquo;s in his residence.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;We can only pray that he's there. Otherwise, searching for the Deepsea Pupils would be akin to trying to fish for a needle in this vast sea,&rdquo; said Grandmaster Liangqiu.<br>Hearing those words, both Chu Feng and Chu Xuanzhengfa started frowning.<br>Even though they knew that they would not be able to obtain the Deepsea Pupils without a hitch, they did not expect the journey to be so unfavorable from the very start.<br>They needed to resign themselves to fate just figuring out where the Deepsea Pupils were.<br>&ldquo;Buzz~~~&rdquo;<br>Right after Grandmaster Liangqiu finished his words, a figure walked out from the teleportation formation.<br>Upon seeing that person, Chu Feng, Grandmaster Liangqiu and Chu Xuanzhengfa all revealed astonished looks on their faces. At the same time, they felt somewhat panicky.<br>The reason for that was because the person who walked out from the teleportation formation was Gu Mingyuan.<br>At that moment, Gu Mingyuan was emitting steam from her entire body. Her eyes were completely bloodshot. Her body was covered in scalding wounds. She was extremely weak. Even an expert like her was unable to stand firm.<br>&ldquo;Mingyuan, what happened to you?&rdquo;<br>Seeing Gu Mingyuan like that, Chu Xuanzhengfa felt extremely pained. He immediately went up and tried to support her.<br>&ldquo;Move aside!&rdquo;<br>However, before Chu Xuanzhengfa could get close to Gu Mingyuan, she waved her sleeve and sent him flying.<br>Then, she arrived before Chu Feng and took Chu Lingxi, who Chu Feng was carrying on his back.<br>&ldquo;Lingxi&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Seeing the eyeless Chu Lingxi who she was carrying in her arms, Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s voice trembled.<br>When Gu Mingyuan first appeared, tears were already present on her face. And now, tears were rolling down her cheeks nonstop.<br>She was truly grieving. Chu Feng was able to sense her suffering from her voice.<br>After all, all of them cared greatly for Chu Lingxi.<br>&ldquo;Linghu Hongfei!!!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will have your Linghu Heavenly Clan never be at ease!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Gu Mingyuan looked toward the sky and shouted furiously. Her voice was so powerful that the clouds above were dispersed by it, and the tranquil sea surface erupted.<br>Gu Mingyuan&rsquo;s killing intent was even more intense than the killing intent Chu Feng had revealed earlier.<br>However, after Gu Mingyuan finished shouting those words, her body grew limp, and she fell unconscious.<br></p></div>
