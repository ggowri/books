        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Fiancee<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Chu Feng, that&rsquo;s a good name.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, this old man is called Gong Chengde. I am actually an old friend of your clan&rsquo;s clan chief,&rdquo; The Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s such a thing?&rdquo; Chu Feng revealed a surprised look upon hearing that. He had thought that the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was merely a good-natured person. Never did he expect him to be a friend of his own clan chief.<br>&ldquo;How could I lie about that? If you don&rsquo;t trust me, you can go and ask your clan chief.&rdquo;<br>Perhaps the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was truly an old friend of the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Because of that, he looked to Chu Feng in a particularly amiable manner.<br>Originally, he had planned to continue to chat with Chu Feng. However, right at that moment, the young woman with the cultivation of rank two Heavenly Immortal who stood beside him suddenly spoke.<br>&ldquo;Grandfather, we still have things to do. If you want to talk about former times, it would be best to do it another day.&rdquo;<br>It turned out that the young woman was actually the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s granddaughter. It was no wonder those Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations would fear her like that.<br>&ldquo;Haha, I&rsquo;d nearly forgotten about my proper business.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, I still have something to settle. As such, I&rsquo;ll take my leave first.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When you return to your clan, please greet your clan chief for me. Tell him to prepare a couple jugs of good wine, for I will pay him a visit when I have the time.&rdquo; The Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;This junior will definitely pass it on to my Lord Clan Chief,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Afterwards, the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief led the various younger generations of the Gong Heavenly Clan and left.<br>Before leaving, those Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s younger generations all glared fiercely at Chu Feng.<br>However, the woman was an exception. She had never bothered to even look at Chu Feng the entire time. She was truly haughty and proud.<br>While it was true that she had never placed Chu Feng in her eyes, she actually did not know that she&hellip; had never been placed in Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes either.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, just then, wasn&rsquo;t that&hellip; that old codger, Gong Chende?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What did he say to you?&rdquo;<br>The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief returned with Wuma Shengjie.<br>&ldquo;Senior, you know him?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course I do. Myself, your clan&rsquo;s clan chief and that old codger have known each other for thousands of years,&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;In that case, he really is my clan chief's friend then?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Of course. Oh, that&rsquo;s right, what did he say to you?&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>Earlier, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was quite far away from Chu Feng. When he noticed that the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was next to Chu Feng, the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was already leading his younger generations and leaving.<br>He had only realized that the Gong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had said something to Chu Feng, and did not know exactly what he had said.<br>Seeing that the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was so curious, Chu Feng began to tell him what had happened in detail.<br>&ldquo;Haha, that old codger is actually so foolish.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Upon hearing what had happened, the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief burst into loud laughter.<br>&ldquo;Senior, what&rsquo;s funny about it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a frown.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. Chu Feng, let me ask you this: when you told him you were called Chu Feng, did that old codger have a surprised reaction?&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;That seemed to be the case,&rdquo; Chu Feng recalled what had happened, and discovered that what the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said seemed to be very correct.<br>&ldquo;There you go. That old codger was extremely sensitive to your name.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, he must&rsquo;ve thought that you only had the same name, and weren&rsquo;t Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son. If he had known that you were Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son, he would definitely not leave just like that. Instead, he would&rsquo;ve definitely grabbed your hand and refused to let go,&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, why would that be the case?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>Even the cold and detached Wuma Shengjie began to blink her large eyes to look at her clan chief. She also really wanted to know exactly what sort of shenanigans were going on.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, let me ask you this. Have you heard anyone addressing that lass who followed that old codger as Gong Mingyue?&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked again.<br>&ldquo;Her&hellip;? Eh&hellip; she did seemed to be named Gong Mingyue,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;There you go. In short, that Gong Mingyue could be said to be your fiance,&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Not to mention Chu Feng, even Wuma Shengjie opened her little mouth in astonishment.<br>&ldquo;Back then, before your father brought you back, that old codger set up an arrangement with your grandfather. They said that if Chu Xuanyuan were to give birth to a daughter in the future, he would have his grandson marry her. If he is to give birth to a son, he will marry his granddaughter to his son.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;After so many years have passed, that old codger managed to have quite a few grandsons. However, he only has a single granddaughter, Gong Mingyue.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, she is your fiance,&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;My clan chief agreed to such a preposterous marriage?&rdquo; Chu Feng felt very helpless.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. Your clan chief not only agreed to it, he also agreed to more than a single family. Back then, he was throwing a vast net for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say it like this. Chu Feng, in the future, when your name resonates throughout the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, there will be a bunch of old codgers who will bring their younger generations to find you and force you to marry them,&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip; my clan&rsquo;s clan chief seemed like a proper person. How could he do such do such an unreasonable thing?&rdquo; Black lines began to roll down Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead.<br>&ldquo;Haha, what&rsquo;s wrong with that? Isn&rsquo;t it very normal for a man to have three wives and four concubines?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;When the time comes, just marry any of them that you find yourself to be fond of. Those that you do not like, just drive them away,&rdquo; The Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke in a very indifferent manner.<br>&ldquo;Scoundrels,&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie cast a fierce side-eye at both her clan chief and Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng coughed, &ldquo;What does this have to do with me? It&rsquo;s not me who made all those arranged marriages,&rdquo; Chu Feng hurriedly explained.<br>&ldquo;Whether or not it was you who made those arranged marriages has nothing to do with me. Why are you trying to explain yourself to me?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie rolled her eyes at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;While this matter might not have anything to do with you, I need you to understand that I, Chu Feng, am an affectionate, true, and upright gentleman. I am not a fickle person who takes a fancy to of every woman I encounter,&rdquo; Chu Feng spoke in a deadpan manner.<br>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie took a glance at Chu Feng. Then, she said with a low voice, &ldquo;The way you looked at me back then didn&rsquo;t seem like the gaze of an upright gentleman.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip; back then&hellip; regarding that&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng opened his mouth, but was at a loss as to how to explain.<br>He knew what Wuma Shengjie was talking about. Naturally, she was talking about the time when he saw her naked.<br>At that time, Chu Feng had seen her completely. He really had no way to refute that.<br>&ldquo;Senior, let us hasten our journey,&rdquo; Helpless, Chu Feng looked to the Wuma Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br></p></div>
