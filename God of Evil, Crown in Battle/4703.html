        <h1>Chapter 4702</h1>
        <div>: Senior Song<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Brat, you&rsquo;re quite arrogant, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the bald man asked.<br>&ldquo;Speak if you have business with me. Otherwise, pardon me for not having the time to entertain you,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied impatiently.<br>&ldquo;Bloody hell! How dare you speak to me in such a manner? Do you know who I am? I am Zhang Kuang! To dare to put on airs before me, you think I dare not beat you up?&rdquo;<br>The bald man raised his arm threateningly, showing that he wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to strike Chu Feng if he continued speaking rudely to him.<br>The crowd quickly scattered out of fear of being implicated. They looked at Chu Feng with eyes filled with pity, thinking that he had offended someone whom he shouldn&rsquo;t have.<br>However, contrary to everyone&rsquo;s expectations, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t lower his head. Instead, his eyes turned wintry cold.<br>&ldquo;Let me warn you, you better not try to touch me. Otherwise&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Otherwise what?&rdquo; the bald man asked menacingly.<br>&ldquo;If you want to know, go ahead and give it a try,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Heck! You think I really dare not to hit you, huh? I&rsquo;m Zhang Kuang!&rdquo;<br>The bald man was ready to strike down on Chu Feng, but in the last moment, he suddenly found himself hesitating. He had caught sight of Chu Feng&rsquo;s gaze, and he suddenly had a feeling that he was staring into the depths of the abyss. A shudder ran down his spine as he got a feeling that he would suffer a tragic fate if he were to push on here.<br>He couldn&rsquo;t believe it, but he was actually scared of Chu Feng! An unspeakable terror was swallowing his heart, consuming his soul.<br>&ldquo;Senior Zhang, calm down!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior Song only told us to bring him over, he didn&rsquo;t instruct us to take care of him!&rdquo;<br>Seeing that the bald man was put in a difficult position, the other two rank one Utmost Exalted level disciple quickly stepped forward to help him out.<br>&ldquo;You nasty brat! In view of Senior Song, I&rsquo;ll let you off this once! Now, you have to follow us somewhere else!&rdquo;<br>Even though the bald man had put down his upraised hands, he still continued speaking in an authoritative tone that made it seem as if he was ordering Chu Feng around.<br>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Senior Song? Is he an elder of a disciple?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Why? Are you not going to meet him if he&rsquo;s not an elder?&rdquo; the bald man asked in displeasure.<br>&ldquo;If an elder wishes to meet me, I&rsquo;ll head over to pay my respects. However, if it&rsquo;s a disciple who wishes to meet me, he can pay me a visit on his own.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, he began walking toward his residence.<br>&ldquo;Hold it right there! Chu Feng, you should know that Senior Song is no ordinary disciple! He&rsquo;s the strongest disciple of our North Tortoise Hall. You might not know Senior Song well because you have just joined our sect, but I advise you to head there obediently. Otherwise, you won&rsquo;t be able to bear the consequences of your disrespect!&rdquo;<br>The two disciples beside the bald man quickly spoke up.<br>Chu Feng had joined many sects before, so he was familiar with this development of affairs. It was just the strongest disciple of the North Tortoise Hall feeling threatened by a formidable new disciple, so he wanted to establish his dominance over him.<br>A senior should be taking care of his juniors instead of picking on them. Chu Feng already had his own judgment on what kind of person Senior Song was, and his instincts told him that he wouldn&rsquo;t get along well with the latter.<br>Since that was the case, there was no need for him to maintain politeness.<br>Unexpectedly, just as Chu Feng was about to turn him down once more, Yu Sha&rsquo;s voice suddenly sounded in Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you should just head over to take a look. It&rsquo;d only be a short while anyway. If they still try to mess with you afterward, the fault is at least not with you. This is Miss Eggy&rsquo;s intention too. She told me to try to keep you out of trouble wherever possible.&rdquo;<br>Had Yu Sha just persuaded Chu Feng normally, he would have probably just shrugged it off. However, when she raised Eggy&rsquo;s name, he found himself compelled to go along with her.<br>&ldquo;Lead the way,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Tsk&hellip; I thought that you would have more backbone, but it looks like you&rsquo;re all bark and no bite. I guess that&rsquo;s to be expected. After all, there&rsquo;s no one here who hasn&rsquo;t heard of Senior Song&rsquo;s reputation!&rdquo;<br>The three men gleefully insulted Chu Feng after seeing him coming to a compromise. This made Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes turn cold once more.<br>&ldquo;You lot sure are shameless.&rdquo;<br>A sudden insult caused the three men to turn around, only to realize that Chu Feng was standing still, looking at them with eyes filled with hostility. The earlier words came from his mouth.<br>&ldquo;Were you the one who said those words earlier?&rdquo; the bald man asked.<br>&ldquo;Why bother asking the obvious?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Bloody hell, you really think I dare not hit you? I am Zhang Kuang!&rdquo;<br>Zhang Kuang could no longer bear it anymore after being put down by Chu Feng time and time again. He raised his hand to strike down on the latter.<br>Tzlala!<br>However, a streak of lightning suddenly flashed past, and a silhouette descended from the sky to the ground. When everyone took a closer look at what was going on, they all froze up in shock.<br>The one who was smashed into the ground was not Chu Feng but the bald man!<br>The bald man hadn&rsquo;t suffered any severe injuries, but there was a bloodied handprint on his face. Clearly, instead of hitting Chu Feng, he ended up getting hit instead.<br>But this couldn&rsquo;t have been possible. Wasn&rsquo;t Zhang Kuang was rank two Utmost Exalted level whereas Chu Feng was only at rank one?<br>Everyone turned to look at Chu Feng once more, only to come to a realization.<br>There was a mark of lightning crackling on Chu Feng&rsquo;s forehead, and the prowess he was emanated was no longer that of a rank one but a rank two Utmost Exalted level cultivator.<br>&ldquo;Lightning Mark! He cultivated the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How formidable! It&rsquo;s no wonder why he dares tosnub Zhang Kuang despite knowing his cultivation level!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This new disciple is truly fearsome. I was still harboring doubts when I heard that he defeated the East Dragon Hall&rsquo;s Xu Cheng in a single hit earlier, but it looks like those rumors are true after all!&rdquo;<br>Fear was in the eyes of the disciples looking at Chu Feng.<br>To be able to defeat even someone of Zhang Kuang&rsquo;s caliber, it was made plain obvious that Chu Feng was not a pushover, be it in terms of strength or personality.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you&hellip; Just you wait! Senior Song will surely avenge me! You better be prepared!&rdquo;<br>The other two disciples were afraid, but they still let out threats to uphold their reputation. Unfortunately, the sight of them fleeing with Zhang Kuang looked hardly flattering at all.<br>Meanwhile, Chu Feng simply sneered coldly before returning back to his residence.<br>A while later, an even louder commotion occurred outside his residence. Chu Feng could sense that there were over a hundred people soaring in his direction before landing right in the midst of his residence. All of these people were at Utmost Exalted level.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, come out!&rdquo;<br>As soon as they landed, they began shouting at Chu Feng, taunting him.<br>&ldquo;This is bad! Senior Song actually came here personally.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If an elder doesn&rsquo;t stand up for him here, Chu Feng would really be a goner!&rdquo;<br>Those surrounding the area knew that there was further drama awaiting them, so they chose to linger around the area. As a result, the crowd was even greater than before. Looking at the hundred cultivators gathered in the area and the man standing at the forefront of the group, some of them shook their heads in pity while the others smiled in glee.<br>They knew that Chu Feng was not a pushover, but with how the situation was developing, it was likely that he would suffer greatly from his earlier arrogance.<br>After all, these hundred cultivators were the strongest disciples of the North Tortoise Hall at the moment.<br>Boom!<br>The door to the residence opened, and a man walked out.<br>This person was no other than Chu Feng. He was already prepared to meet with the strongest disciple of the North Tortoise Hall.<br>&ldquo;Senior Song, he&rsquo;s the one! He&rsquo;s the one who hit me! I told him to come along with me to meet you, but he&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The bald man Chu Feng had struck earlier on ran to Senior Song&rsquo;s side and began uttering all sorts of falsehoods about Chu Feng, hoping to stir enmity between the two of them.<br>Pah!<br>Unexpectedly, before he could even finish his words, Senior Song raised his arm and struck the bald man on his cheeks. His strike was far more vicious than Chu Feng&rsquo;s, marring the bald man&rsquo;s face and nearly disfiguring him for good.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Everyone was taken aback by his action. Even Chu Feng was surprised too.<br>He wondered if he had misunderstood the situation, that Senior Song wasn&rsquo;t as vile as he thought him out to be. It was then that Senior Song suddenly walked over to Chu Feng briskly, and he did something that shocked everyone.<br>He&hellip; actually wrapped his arms around Chu Feng and hugged him!<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I didn&rsquo;t expect to see you here! I thought that it was just someone with a similar name!&rdquo; Senior Song spoke in agitation.<br>&ldquo;Y-you are&hellip;?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng took a closer look at the man before him, but he couldn&rsquo;t recognize him at all. Senior Song appeared to have been some sort of torture, resulting in his face becoming completely disfigured.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, do you recognize me no more? I am Song Xi!&rdquo; Senior Song said.<br></p></div>
