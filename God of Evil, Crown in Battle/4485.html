        <h1>Chapter 4484</h1>
        <div>: Could She Be Grandmother?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng recognized the person in the painting.<br>Back when he was at the Reincarnation Upper Realm, he needed a large amount of Spirit Spring Water in order to increase his spirit power.<br>So, he headed to the Mount Ivory Valley, and there, he met a mysterious old woman.<br>This old woman was dressed in fine robes, and she had an exceptional disposition. However, her face was filled with injuries that ruined her countenance.<br>Back then, the old woman tried to wash her face with poisonous water, only to be stopped by Chu Feng.<br>In their short time together, Chu Feng noticed that the old woman wasn&rsquo;t in the right state of mind, making it nigh impossible for Chu Feng to interact with her normally.<br>That being said, she did possess exceptionally powerful cultivation. That fitted with Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s description of the old woman.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually her? What relations does she have with my grandfather? Could she possibly be my grandmother?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart fell into turmoil.<br>He could still remember the feeling of intimacy when he first saw the old woman. Looking at it now, it could have just been the connection that had come from sharing the same bloodline.<br>If she was really his grandmother, wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that he had passed her by?<br>Just what in the world had she been through that resulted in her losing her mind and scarring her face?<br>Initially, Chu Feng was only curious about her plight, but recalling the state she was in back then now made him feel as if a sharp knife had been plunged into his chest.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, what&rsquo;s wrong? Could it be that you recognize this elder?&rdquo;<br>The sharp-witted Xian Miaomiao noticed that Chu Feng was in a state of discomposure, such that all of his emotions were shown on his face. This made her realize that Chu Feng could very well know the person in the painting.<br>&ldquo;Miaomiao, given our relationship, there&rsquo;s no need for me to hide anything from you,&rdquo; Chu Feng told Xian Miaomiao through voice transmission.<br>&ldquo;So, you really know her?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao replied through voice transmission too.<br>&ldquo;Chu Hanxian is my grandfather. I have met that old woman before, and if my deduction is right, she could very well be my grandmother,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s your grandmother?&rdquo;<br>Xian Miaomiao couldn&rsquo;t remain calm after hearing those words.<br>She hadn&rsquo;t met that old woman in person, but she did hear about how frightening the power she possessed was. Such a formidable figure was actually Chu Feng&rsquo;s grandmother?<br>She had never expected such a thing to be possible.<br>&hellip;<br>Following that, Chu Feng began filling Xian Miaomiao in on the details of the matter.<br>Xian Miaomiao was a little shocked to hear his story, but she didn&rsquo;t doubt his words at all. Their relationship was close enough for her to trust him unconditionally.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, my clan is currently putting all our efforts into tracking this elder down. Give me the address of where you&rsquo;re residing at the moment, and I&rsquo;ll inform you as soon as we find that elder.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to worry that much for now. If that elder is really your grandmother, it&rsquo;s at least good news that she&rsquo;s still alive. She might be in an irrational state at the moment, but there&rsquo;s nothing in the world that can&rsquo;t be cured. Once her condition is cured, we might be able to find the whereabouts of your grandfather too,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao consoled Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s emotions had also more or less calmed down at this point too.<br>He was not an emotional person, but he would often lose his cool whenever it came to matters regarding his family members.<br>He also understood what Xian Miaomiao had told him. While it was saddening to hear that the old woman who could very well be his grandmother wasn&rsquo;t in the right state of mind, it was at least a blessing that she was still alive.<br>Following that, Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao began chatting about other matters.<br>The two of them hadn&rsquo;t met for many years, and the two of them were rather curious about what the other had been through during this period of time.<br>Of course, there were simply too many things that Chu Feng had faced over the years, and if they were to go down to the details, their conversation could easily last for ten days. So, they simply shared how they did briefly.<br>Chu Feng knew that it would be better to rely on the influence of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan to find the whereabouts of the old woman who could very well be his grandmother, so he had to remain in contact with Xian Miaomiao.<br>However, there was an issue here. Chu Feng hadn&rsquo;t settled down anywhere, and he had no plans on doing so in the near future. So, he was unable to give an address to Xian Miaomiao.<br>In the end, they agreed that Chu Feng would head over to the Nine Souls Sacred Clan to look for her after he was done dealing with various matters he had on hand.<br>And when Xian Miaomiao heard that Chu Feng would be visiting her, she was overjoyed. She gave him a token that would grant him entry into the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br>They were still intending to chat for a little longer, but the two Supreme Elders outside had started to rush Xian Miaomiao. It looked like there was something urgent that Xian Miaomiao had to attend to.<br>Even though Xian Miaomiao was of high standing within the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, she still didn&rsquo;t have the power to directly oppose the decision of the two Supreme Elders yet.<br>So, the two friends who had just reunited for a short moment after many years were forced to part once more.<br>&hellip;<br>Bam bam bam!<br>The humongous war chariot began to depart under the galloping of over ten thousand massive winged horses. The flags of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan that hung on the war chariot commanded the deference of those standing before it.<br>Inside one of the palaces inside the war chariot stood Xian Miaomiao and the two Supreme Elders.<br>&ldquo;Miaomiao, I didn&rsquo;t think that you have such a friend. For his presence to invoke your lost memories, it seems like the two of you are on good terms. This is good news.&rdquo;<br>The two Supreme Elders looked at Xian Miaomiao with delightful expressions as they rejoiced over this happy occasion.<br>But in contrast, Xian Miaomiao didn&rsquo;t even have any trace of a smile on her face.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not oblivious to the fact that you were the ones who intentionally sealed off my memories,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao remarked coldly.<br>&ldquo;Miaomiao, what are you saying? How could we dare to do something like that?&rdquo; the two Supreme Elders exclaimed with wronged looks on their faces.<br>&ldquo;I know that my mother is behind it, but the two of you are accomplices too. I hope that you can inform my mother on my behalf that she need not think of erasing my memories a second time. If she does so, I&rsquo;ll sever our familial ties.<br>&ldquo;Other than that, you are not to inflict any harm upon that friend of mine. If anyone dares to go against my words, they&rsquo;ll have hell to pay for!&rdquo;<br>There was a chilling edge in Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s eyes as she said those words.<br></p></div>
