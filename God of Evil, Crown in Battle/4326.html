        <h1>Chapter 4325</h1>
        <div>: Venting Anger<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But shortly after releasing his oppressive might, there was yet another change in Elder Lingtao&rsquo;s gaze.<br>Usually, as soon as he released oppressive might of such intensity, Long Nanxun would have already lost his nerves and fled as far as he could.<br>Yet, Long Nanxun didn&rsquo;t escape this time around. Not only that, but his expression also remained completely calm.<br>This left Elder Ling Tao feeling deeply bewildered.<br>&ldquo;Long Lingtao, do you really think that you can act as you please just because you have the backing of Princess Mumu? Do you think that Princess Mumu will remain in power forever?&rdquo; Long Nanxun asked.<br>Upon hearing these words, Chu Feng finally understood why they were antagonistic toward one another. It turned out that Elder Lingtao was one of Long Mumu&rsquo;s people!<br>Most likely, the people guarding this area were all Long Mumu&rsquo;s people.<br>For the ones guarding Long Xiaoxiao to actually be Long Mumu&rsquo;s people&hellip; it would appear that Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s plight was even less optimistic than he had thought.<br>&ldquo;This old man only heeds the orders of the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. Long Nanxun, you can doubt me, but you can&rsquo;t doubt Lord Clan Chief. It&rsquo;s a crime that warrants the death penalty. If not out of face for your grandfather, I could have had you sentenced to death on the spot.<br>&ldquo;So, I suggest that you disappear before my eyes this instant, and I&rsquo;ll treat it as if you were never here. If you continue to loiter around this area, don&rsquo;t blame me for getting nasty!&rdquo; Elder Lingtao spat coldly.<br>It appeared that Elder Lingtao had some considerations for not making a move on Long Nanxun right away.<br>&ldquo;You said that you only heed the orders of Lord Clan Chief?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Long Nanxun sneered, &ldquo;Let me you tell you this then. I came here today with Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s permission!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You have the permission of Lord Clan Chief?&rdquo;<br>Instead of falling into a state of rage, Elder Lingtao reined in his oppressive might and burst into laughter.<br>His laughter sounded loudly across his surroundings, as if he wasn&rsquo;t afraid of anyone hearing him at all. It was filled with arrogance, smugness, and most important of all, mockery.<br>Everyone who heard the laughter could sense the mockery directed toward Long Nanxun.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re laughing? Long Lingtao, open your dog eyes and see what this is!&rdquo;<br>Swoosh!<br>With a grand wave of his sleeves, Long Nanxun took out a token and shoved it in Elder Lingtao&rsquo;s face.<br>It was none other than the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief Token.<br>The Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had given it to Long Nanxun earlier when he had instructed the latter to lead Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Y-you&hellip; Where did you get this token from?!&rdquo;<br>Elder Lingtao, who was still laughing smugly a moment ago, was utterly flabbergasted.<br>This token was unique in the world; it was impossible for anyone to fake it. That was why he was certain at first glance that this was indeed the Dragon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief Token.<br>But how did something as valuable as the Clan Chief Token fall into Long Nanxun&rsquo;s hands?<br>Putting aside Long Nanxun, not even Long Nanxun&rsquo;s grandfather had the right to lay his hands on the Clan Chief Token!<br>In the face of Elder Lingtao&rsquo;s incomprehension, Long Nanxun didn&rsquo;t bother to explain himself. Instead, he said, &ldquo;This token represents the authority of the Clan Chief himself. Aren&rsquo;t you going to kneel?&rdquo;<br>Plonk!<br>As unwilling as Elder Lingtao was, he still knelt down in midair.<br>Not only so, but the other presences who had been watching what was going on from the shadows also began to move as well. One after another, they appeared behind Elder Lingtao.<br>In the blink of an eye, there were already several hundred of them.<br>They were the ones who were in charge of guarding Long Xiaoxiao, and they had been hiding in the void all this while.<br>But right now, they didn&rsquo;t dare to remain in hiding anymore. This was not out of fear of Long Nanxun but the token that he held.<br>All of them kneeled down before Long Nanxun in midair, not daring to lift their heads in the slightest.<br>They were waiting for an order to be passed down from the wielder of the Clan Chief Token, even though most of them detested Long Nanxun and viewed him in contempt.<br>However, as long as Long Nanxun had the Clan Chief Token in his hand, they would have no choice but to execute any orders that he commanded.<br>This was the power that the Clan Chief Token held!<br>&ldquo;Elder Lingtao, the tide of fortune ebbs and flows. You&rsquo;ll be sorely mistaken if you think that Princess Mumu will be able to protect you for your entire life. In the end, Princess Xiaoxiao is still the daughter favored by Lord Clan Chief,&rdquo; Long Nanxun said.<br>&ldquo;Young Master Nanxun, it&rsquo;s under Lord Clan Chief&rsquo;s orders that my men and I are guarding this location. I have never made things difficult for Princess Xiaoxiao before, and I don&rsquo;t have the guts to do that either.&rdquo;<br>In just a matter of moments, the tone that Elder Lingtao took had become vastly different from before.<br>He was still acting high and mighty just a moment ago, only to be speaking so humbly at this moment.<br>And this was all due to the authority of the Clan Chief Token.<br>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Princess Xiaoxiao?&rdquo; Long Nanxun asked.<br>The land occupied by Long Xiaoxiao was simply too big, such that it could even count as a country by itself. Furthermore, Long Xiaoxiao was a restless person. It was impossible for her to remain inside her own chambers obediently.<br>As such, Long Nanxun posed this question to Elder Lingtao so as to ensure that they could find her as quickly as possible.<br>&ldquo;Young Master Nanxun, I saw Princess Xiaoxiao at the Moongazing Gazebo during my patrol a few hours ago. However, I&rsquo;m not too sure whether she&rsquo;ll still be there now,&rdquo; one of the elders replied.<br>After hearing this piece of news, Long Nanxun flung his sleeves backward imposingly before heading deeper into the land together with Chu Feng. He maintained a solemn look on his face till he was finally out of those elders&rsquo; areas of perception.<br>Then, a gleeful smile carrying the innocence of a child curled on his face.<br>&ldquo;Exhilarating! That was really exhilarating! Those darned things had never put me in their eyes before just because they had the backing of Long Mumu and her mother. Finally, I was able to get back at them for the disdain they&rsquo;ve shown me all this while. Chu Feng, this is all thanks to you!&rdquo;<br>While holding the Clan Chief Token in his hand tightly, Long Nanxun thanked Chu Feng with an earnest look on his face.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all for Princess Xiaoxiao,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Long Nanxun nodded in agreement.<br>Following that, they advanced to the Moongazing Gazebo with hastened speed. In truth, he was more worried about Long Xiaoxiao than anyone else at the moment.<br></p></div>
