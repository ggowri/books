        <div> - Chu Feng&rsquo;s Ranking<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;That world spiritist cloak is truly extraordinary. It is most definitely a rare treasure.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Where did Chu Feng obtain such a treasure?&rdquo;<br>An old lady from the Li Heavenly Clan gasped with admiration.<br>That old lady had a very aged appearance, so aged that it was somewhat terrifying.<br>Her face was covered in wrinkles, and her skin was completely withered up. She seemed like a dried corpse that had crawled out of a coffin.<br>That said, she was someone who possessed status and power that one could not look down upon. She was one of the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elders.<br>On the day when the Upper Realm Gate opened between the Li Heavenly Clan and the Chu Heavenly Clan, she was the first Supreme Elder to arrive on the scene.<br>Furthermore, she was also one of the people that was fully supportive of waging war against the Chu Heavenly Clan. Just earlier, she had also lashed out at Chu Feng for insulting Li Taiyi.<br>She was someone who possessed deep hostility toward both Chu Feng and the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>However, not only had the hostility that she held toward Chu Feng lessened, but she also felt admiration towards his performance. Regardless of whether he might be a friend or foe, she had to admit that Chu Feng was very outstanding.<br>At that moment, her gaze was focused on Chu Feng&rsquo;s cloak. Based on her experience, she was certain that that cloak was a priceless treasure.<br>In fact, there were a lot of Li Heavenly Clansmen acting in the same manner as her. Even the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was inspecting Chu Feng&rsquo;s cloak. In fact, even Li Taiyi, who had been humiliated by Chu Feng earlier, was no exception.<br>Seeing her clan&rsquo;s proud and aloof elders staring at Chu Feng&rsquo;s cloak in such a manner while praising him nonstop and making all sorts of guesses, the corners of Li Ruochu&rsquo;s lips rose into a mischievous smile.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, you all don't have to make any more guesses. That is the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak,&rdquo; she said all of a sudden.<br>&ldquo;What? Nine Dragons Saint Cloak?&rdquo;<br>Sure enough, it was as Li Ruochu had anticipated, once she said those words, she immediately received an intense reaction from the crowd.<br>&ldquo;Ruochu, you said it&rsquo;s the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Could that Nine Dragons Saint Cloak that you spoke of be the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak left on the Nine Dragons Upper Realm&rsquo;s Ice Summit by the legendary World Spiritist Immortal King?&rdquo; Berserker Li asked.<br>&ldquo;Senior, it's precisely that Nine Dragons Saint Cloak,&rdquo; Li Ruochu answered.<br>&ldquo;Clamor~~~&rdquo;<br>After verifying the identity of the cloak, shock filled the faces of all of the Li Heavenly Clansmen. They were all deeply astonished.<br>After all, they were all people that had heard about the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.<br>After being astonished, someone asked, &ldquo;How could such a treasure be on him?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Apart from breaching the grand formation, how else could one obtain the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak?&rdquo; Li Ruochu asked.<br>&ldquo;Breaching the grand formation?&rdquo; Thinking of that, the Li Heavenly Clansmen felt their hair stand on end.<br>Due to how difficult it was to breach the formation on the Ice Summit, it was known as one of the Ancestral Martial Starfield&rsquo;s Three Great Eccentrics&rsquo; Remnants.<br>The Three Great Eccentrics&rsquo; Remnants were all places that no one could breach.<br>One such place was actually breached by Chu Feng?<br>&ldquo;Ruochu, you cannot joke around with something like this,&rdquo; Berserker Li said to Li Ruochu.<br>Berserker Li had a pretty decent relationship with Li Ruochu. That was the reason why he said that.<br>He knew Li Ruochu, and knew that she was a weird and daring little girl. Thus, he was afraid that she might be joking with them.<br>It would be one thing had she been joking at other times; everyone would definitely forgive her. However, if she were to say that that was the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak as joke at that moment, it would not be funny at all.<br>Berserker Li was afraid that she would be punished by their Lord Clan Chief for making such a joke.<br>&ldquo;Senior, no matter how daring Ruochu might be, I would still not make this sort of irresponsible remark.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve said is the truth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, it's precisely because Chu Feng breached the grand formation left behind by that great world spiritist that he obtained Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s acknowledgement. That day, outside the Ice Summit, Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan even fought over taking Chu Feng as their disciple,&rdquo; Li Ruochu said.<br>&ldquo;He was fought over by Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan?&rdquo;<br>Li Anzhi, Li Tianyou and the other geniuses of the Li Heavenly Clan looked to one another. The astonishment in their eyes grew even more intense.<br>They had all heard of what sort of characters Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan were.<br>To become a disciple of either of them would most definitely be an enormous honor.<br>&ldquo;In other words&hellip; young friend Chu Feng is now Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s disciple?&rdquo; the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>Upon hearing those words, Li Taiyi&rsquo;s heart tensed up.<br>It was not only Li Taiyi whose heart grew tense. The hearts of many of the other Li Heavenly Clan elders also tensed up.<br>The reason for that was because it would mean that the person that they had criticized and offended earlier was not only a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan, but he was also Grandmaster Liangqiu&rsquo;s disciple.<br>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not it,&rdquo; Li Ruochu shook her head.<br>&ldquo;You mean to say that young friend Chu Feng agreed to become Grandmaster Long Xuan&rsquo;s disciple instead?&rdquo; the Li Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief asked.<br>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t do that either. Chu Feng refused both of them,&rdquo; said Li Ruochu.<br>&ldquo;Refused?&rdquo;<br>The Li Heavenly Clansmen did not dare to believe what they&rsquo;d just heard. They were also unable to understand why Chu Feng would refuse both Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan.<br>However, upon thinking about it deeply, since Chu Feng had dared to refuse even Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan, what boldness did he possess?<br>Thus, Chu Feng demanding that Li Taiyi kneel to him could not amount to much. After all, he was someone who would dare to refuse even the kind intentions of Grandmaster Liangqiu and Grandmaster Long Xuan.<br>Furthermore, he had refused them publicly!!!<br>&ldquo;This aspect of that Chu Feng rather resembles his father. He is indeed bold and daring,&rdquo; Berserker Li sighed.<br>Suddenly, he asked, &ldquo;In that case, Ruo Chu, did Chu Feng&hellip; participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, Chu Feng indeed participated in it,&rdquo; Li Ruochu answered.<br>&ldquo;How did he perform? What rank did he reach?&rdquo; Berserker Li asked.<br>The reason why he asked that was because he believed that Chu Feng, with his strength, would definitely be able to rank among the Ancestral Martial Decastars. The only question was what rank he would end up at.<br>Once Berserker Li asked that question, the crowd all turned their eyes to Li Ruochu. They were all very curious.<br>&ldquo;Linghu Hongfei was ranked first in this year&rsquo;s selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars,&rdquo; Li Ruochu said.<br>Why did she mention Linghu Hongfei?<br>Weren&rsquo;t they asking about Chu Feng?<br>The crowd were all puzzled. They felt that Li Ruochu was beating around the bush.<br>It was only natural that someone as powerful as Linghu Hongfei would obtain the first ranked spot. Even without Li Ruochu telling them that, they were able to imagine that that would be the case.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng&rsquo;s ranking is the same as his,&rdquo; Li Ruochu added.<br></p></div>
