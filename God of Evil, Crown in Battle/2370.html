        <div> - The One To Be Defeated Is You<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s perception was extremely sharp. He immediately sensed the change in Kong Zheng, and turned his gaze to him.<br>Upon looking at Kong Zheng, Chu Feng was shocked to see that his palm was streaking across his Cosmos Sack, and an Incomplete Ancestral Armament had appeared in his hand. He held that Incomplete Ancestral Armament and slashed it toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Sensing that the situation was amiss, Chu Feng hurriedly revealed his<br>Lightning<br>Armor and<br>Lightning<br>Wings. As his cultivation increased, Chu Feng immediately and rapidly moved back.<br>Seeing that Chu Feng had dodged, Kong Zheng said with a laugh, &ldquo;You actually dodged it? It would appear that the reactions of World Spiritists are truly not to be looked down upon.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Kong Zheng, what is the meaning of this?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked coldly. As he spoke, he took out his Incomplete Ancestral Armament, the Magma Emperor Sword.<br>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this? Is it not obvious enough? You couldn&rsquo;t possibly really be thinking that I would bring you into the Hundred Refinements Stage, right?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Truth be told, I deliberately approached you, and even made sure to especially use the treasure that my grandfather gave me to disguise my state of mind so that I could gain your trust, and then defeat you while your guard was down. With that, I would be able to prevent you from competing with me,&rdquo; Kong Zheng said.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng finally realized why someone of Kong Zheng&rsquo;s caliber was able to successfully deceive him. It turned out that, for the sake of deceiving him, Kong Zheng had especially used some sort of treasure against a world spiritist&rsquo;s perceptive ability.<br>Unfortunately, this Kong Zheng still ended up ultimately exposing himself. Furthermore, he was discovered by Chu Feng beforehand. Else&hellip; if he truly were to attack when Chu Feng was completely off-guard, Chu Feng might really end up being defeated by him.<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that someone like you was actually capable of scheming,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a light smile. That said, his words were somewhat mocking.<br>After all, if that Kong Zheng had not employed his treasure, then, with merely his capabilities, it would be impossible for him to deceive Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;I never would&rsquo;ve expected that I would still end up failing. If I had known this was going to happen, I would have just attacked you to begin with. After all, I am certain that I am able to defeat you,&rdquo; As Kong Zheng spoke those words, lighting flashed in his eyes.<br>In merely an instant, he unleashed his<br>Lightning<br>Armor and<br>Lightning<br>Wings and increased his cultivation from rank six Half Martial Ancestor to rank eight Half Martial Ancestor.<br>After increasing his cultivation, Kong Zheng once again slashed his Incomplete Ancestral Armament at Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>A slash swept through the sky, ripping the air apart and slicing through space as it shot toward Chu Feng.<br>At that moment, Kong Zheng had a confident smile on his face.<br>The way he saw it, his cultivation was a level above Chu Feng&rsquo;s. As the two of them were both possessors of Heavenly Bloodlines, he felt that regardless of how powerful Chu Feng was, he would not be a match for him.<br>Although he did not unleash his full strength with that attack, he felt that his attack was enough to force Chu Feng to use a Taboo Martial Skill. Else&hellip; with Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength, it would be impossible for him to block that attack.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~:<br>At the same moment when Kong Zheng unleashed his attack, Chu Feng also slashed with his Magma Emperor Sword.<br>As the sword pierced through the air, a fiery dragon-like blaze appeared in the sky and flew toward the slash that Kong Zheng had shot forth.<br>&ldquo;Humph. Overestimating one&rsquo;s capabilities,&rdquo; Seeing that scene, Kong Zheng snorted disdainfully in his heart.<br>The way he saw it, Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack was simply one of arrogance and conceit. It was akin to attempting to strike a stone with an egg. He felt that Chu Feng was simply courting a disaster by treating his attack lightly.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>The very next moment, the two slashes collided with one another. However, the result of the collision was actually a tie.<br>&ldquo;How could this be?!&rdquo; Astonishment filled Kong Zheng&rsquo;s face. He did not dare to believe his eyes.<br>&ldquo;Is it so shocking, so hard to believe? You are clearly a rank six Half Martial Ancestor, whereas I am a rank five Half Martial Ancestor. Moreover, the two of us possess identical bloodlines. In this sort of situation, you should have been able to kill me with a lift of your finger. Yet, how was it that you were unable to injure me in the slightest when we used the same sort of attack?&rdquo; Chu Feng mocked.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve concealed your true cultivation? Could it be that you&rsquo;re a rank six Half Martial Ancestor like me?&rdquo; Kong Zheng asked.<br>He thought that since Chu Feng was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, he would naturally possess many extraordinary abilities. Kong Zheng thought that Chu Feng had used one such ability to conceal his cultivation.<br>Else&hellip; he truly could not believe that Chu Feng&rsquo;s attack would tie with his own.<br>&ldquo;My actual cultivation is that of a rank five Half Martial Ancestor,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that. How could a rank five Half Martial Ancestor be able to fight on par with me? Are you telling me that you possess a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But, I am able to sense that you only possess a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation like me,&rdquo; Kong Zheng said in refusal. He was unable to accept that Chu Feng, a mere rank five Half Martial Ancestor, would be able to fight against him, a rank six Half Martial Ancestor.<br>&ldquo;You are correct, our battle power is the same, we are both only able to surmount three levels of cultivation. The reason why our attacks ended up in a tie is because of my proficiency toward weapons and the strength of my attack,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;What sort of nonsense are you spouting?&rdquo; Kong Zheng was confused.<br>&ldquo;I nearly forgot that your intelligence is lacking. Since that&rsquo;s the case, let me rephrase it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;To put it simply, you are among the weakest rank six Half Martial Ancestors, whereas I am among the strongest rank five Half Martial Ancestors. Thus, even though there is an entire level of cultivation difference between us, I am still able to fight against you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Insolent! You dare say that I&rsquo;m weak?! I&rsquo;ll show you how powerful this young master is!!!&rdquo;<br>After Kong Zheng declared those words, he borrowed the strength of his Incomplete Ancestral Armament and unleashed a Taboo Martial Skill. Furthermore, it was a powerful Earthen Taboo Martial Skill from the get-go.<br>&ldquo;Truly a fool.&rdquo;<br>However, faced with such a frantic attack from Kong Zheng, Chu Feng revealed a joyous smile.<br>Actually, Kong Zheng was not weak. Although he could not be considered to be extremely powerful among rank six Half Martial Ancestors, he was definitely not the weakest.<br>Logically, if Chu Feng had used an ordinary attack like Kong Zheng had, his attack would definitely not be able to tie with Kong Zheng&rsquo;s attack.<br>However, Chu Feng had managed to block Kong Zheng&rsquo;s attack. This meant that his previous attack was no ordinary attack.<br>Actually, what Chu Feng had used was a martial skill. Merely, he had deliberately mixed his spirit power into his attack to conceal the true nature of his attack and make Kong Zheng unable to see through the fact that it was a martial skill, making him think that it was only an ordinary attack.<br>Chu Feng had done so precisely so that Kong Zheng would mistakenly think that he, Chu Feng, was truly unable to contend against him. Then, after Chu Feng added insults, with the temperament that Kong Zheng possessed, he would definitely become extremely enraged.<br>For people like Kong Zheng, they possessed a major flaw. That is, the less calm they became, the more mistakes they made.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>With everything planned, Chu Feng immediately unleashed his counter-attack. Merely, this time around, Chu Feng did not use special methods, and instead unleashed an actual Earthen Taboo Martial Skill.<br>As both of them were Earthen Taboo Martial Skills, the result was obvious; Chu Feng&rsquo;s Earthen Taboo Martial Skill was unable to withstand Kong Zheng&rsquo;s Earthen Taboo Martial Skill.<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>After a loud explosion, the Earthen Taboo Martial Skill Kong Zheng unleashed had completely engulfed Chu Feng&rsquo;s Earthen Taboo Martial Skill. Furthermore, it was charging toward Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Noo!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Chu Feng let out a panicky and unreconciled scream.<br>His voice was so desperate that it pierced through the sky.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~~&rdquo;<br>At the same time that scream was heard, the aftermath of Kong Zheng&rsquo;s Earthen Taboo Martial Skill completely swallowed Chu Feng.<br>Like a hungry wolf devouring its meal, it completely bombarded Chu Feng into an utter mess.<br>&ldquo;Hahaha. Chu Feng, didn&rsquo;t you say that you were very powerful, that I&rsquo;m very weak? Turns out, you were still defeated by me with a single attack!!!&rdquo;<br>After personally seeing that his martial skill left not even a speck of Chu Feng remaining, Kong Zheng burst into a loud and complacent laugh.<br>&ldquo;No, the one that&rsquo;s defeated is you!&rdquo;<br>However, right at that moment, a voice suddenly sounded from behind Kong Zheng.<br>That&hellip; was Chu Feng&rsquo;s voice.<br><br></p></div>
