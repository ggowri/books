        <div> - Gu Poison<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>&ldquo;How did Goudan&rsquo;er&rsquo;s mother die?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;In order to deliver a sufficient amount of poison plants to the Du Clan, Goudan&rsquo;er&rsquo;s mother had grown the poison plants even when she was pregnant with Goudan&rsquo;er. Perhaps it might be that she was poisoned by the poison plants. When Goudan&rsquo;er was born, she died from poison.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Speaking of this, Goudan&rsquo;er&rsquo;s ugly appearance might also be because of the poison. Sigh&hellip;&rdquo; When mentioning this matter, Goudan&rsquo;er&rsquo;s father became sentimental. Evidently, the death of Goudan&rsquo;er&rsquo;s mother was an unforgettable and painful matter to him.<br>&ldquo;In that case, does something like that happen frequently in the village?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Yes. Even though the people in the village are all cultivators, they are in contact with the poison plants all year round. Thus, their bodies are extremely weak. It is not only Goudan&rsquo;er&rsquo;s mother that has died from giving birth.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, there was not anyone that died as miserably as Goudan&rsquo;er&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; Goudan&rsquo;er&rsquo;s father said.<br>&ldquo;Miserable? How?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Her body was infused with poison gas. After she finished giving birth to Goudan&rsquo;er, her entire body was corroded by poison gas. In the end, not even her corpse remained,&rdquo; Speaking of this matter, Goudan&rsquo;er&rsquo;s father had a bitter smile and red eyes.<br>As for Chu Feng, he felt even heavier. Based on what Goudan&rsquo;er&rsquo;s father had said, Goudan&rsquo;er&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s death was clearly unusual.<br>This also greatly increased the possibly of Goudan&rsquo;er being that poisonous substance.<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng asked, &ldquo;Goudan'er's father, if I am able to bring Goudan'er away from here and into the Holy Land of Martialism, are you willing to let me bring him away?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;God? Really? You can take Goudan'er to the Holy Land of Martialism?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you are willing to bring Goudan'er to the Holy Land of Martialism to experience it, I would not be able to thank you enough. I will not be able to repay your grace in my entire life. Even if I have to become an ox or a horse in my next life to work for you, I would be gladly willing to do so.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;God, I am kowtowing to you. I am kneeling to you to express my thanks for your great kindness,&rdquo; Hearing what Chu Feng said, Goudan'er's father was immediately overjoyed. He became extremely emotional and started to tear up. As he spoke, he was about to kneel to the ground and kowtow to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Goudan'er's father, you must not act like this. This matter is still uncertain. However, if I can bring Goudan'er out, I will definitely bring him out,&rdquo; Chu Feng lent Goudan'er's father an arm, stopping him from kneeling. However, he was feeling extremely complicated in his heart.<br>The reason why Chu Feng wanted to bring Goudan'er out was not because he was thinking about Goudan'er's future prospects.<br>Instead, more than that, it was because Chu Feng felt that Goudan'er was that Poisonous Substance. By bringing Goudan'er away from here, he would be able to bring peace to the villagers and the people of the Du Clan.<br>However, Chu Feng was not certain whether he would be able to bring Goudan'er out with him. Whether or not he would succeed would not depend on him. Rather, it would depend on the secret technique that Du Xiangyu had spoken of.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng,&rdquo; Suddenly, a voice sounded. As Chu Feng turned toward the voice, Du Wanwu was standing in the sky. With a cold expression, he looked to Chu Feng and said, &ldquo;Lady Xiangyu is calling for you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; Chu Feng knew that a day&rsquo;s time had passed. Likely, Du Xiangyu had finished preparing the materials needed for that secret technique.<br>Sure enough, when Chu Feng returned to the cave&rsquo;s guest room, Du Xiangyu had already prepared everything.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, this is the secret technique that I spoke of. Please have a look. I believe that, with your world spirit techniques, it should not be hard for you to set it up. If you are to find any difficulties in setting it up, I can assist you.&rdquo;<br>As Du Xiangyu spoke, she took out a scroll, some materials and some poison plants. The scroll had detailed records on how to use the secret technique.<br>In simpler terms, this secret technique was actually a world spirit formation technique. It was a spirit formation with special materials added to it, and made use of poison techniques.<br>However, upon activating the spirit formation, it would indeed be able to make Du Wanwu immune to poisons like Chu Feng for a short period of time. This spirit formation could be said to be extremely profound. Merely, Chu Feng had never seen a spirit formation like this before.<br>Of course, the reason why this spirit formation was able to have this sort of effect was all due to the special poison plants and materials that the Du Clan had prepared.<br>A thing worthy of mentioning was that this Du Clan&rsquo;s secret technique was indeed capable of being used on two people simultaneously. In other words, not only would Chu Feng be able to bring Du Wanwu out with him, he would also be able to bring Goudan'er out with him.<br>Thus, at this moment, Chu Feng was feeling very good.<br>Suddenly, Du Xiangyu said, &ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, there is a matter that I hope that you will be able to help Wanwu with,&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Senior, please tell me what it is,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Back then, before our Ancestor entered this place, he had planted a Gu in the Holy Land of Martialism&rsquo;s Five Poisons Mountain. That Gu is formed by ten thousand poisons. Our Ancestor set up a spirit formation to have it mature in the Five Poisons Mountain. To Wanwu, that is an extremely beneficial cultivation item.&rdquo;[1. A Gu is an ancient Chinese witchcraft. Through special methods, one could meticulously cultivate a mysterious substance known as &lsquo;Gu.&rsquo; The Gu could be big or small. Generally, they take the form of animals or bugs. Those in the form of animals or bugs are generally in a pair. However, there are also rare Gu that take form in the appearance of plants. Found a wiki page for Gu. &ldquo;Right now, that Gu should have already matured. If it is obtained, Wanwu&rsquo;s cultivation will be able to increase greatly.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thus, little friend Chu Feng, I wish to trouble you with helping Wanwu obtain that Gu,&rdquo; Du Xiangyu said.<br>&ldquo;Is this matter dangerous?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;Truth be told, it is dangerous,&rdquo; Du Xiangyu said.<br>&ldquo;Senior, I have only agreed that I would bring Du Wanwu out, and have not agreed to help him search and obtain some sort of Gu,&rdquo; Chu Feng refused.<br>As a world spiritist, Chu Feng knew what Gu&rsquo;s were. There were many different kinds of Gu&rsquo;s. However, they were generally created using very vicious methods to refine very nefarious items.<br>One must always brave dangers to obtain a Gu. The danger might be small or large. However, Chu Feng felt that the Gu that the Poison Demon had planted fifteen thousand years ago would definitely be extremely dangerous to obtain.<br>Chu Feng was unwilling to brave this danger.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, please rest assured. This matter is not as dangerous as you think. After all, you are a world spiritist, and a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist on top of that.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I know that your world spirit techniques are extremely brilliant. It should not be difficult for you to handle that Gu at all,&rdquo; Du Xiangyu said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;Senior, while it is true that junior&rsquo;s world spirit techniques are quite decent, my cultivation is not high. In order to prevent mishaps, how about I bring you out along with Du Wanwu? You can go and help him retrieve that Gu. Wouldn&rsquo;t that solve the problem?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I will bring you two out and then bring you two back. Then, I will bring Du Wanwu out himself. Senior, what do you think about that?&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Little friend Chu Feng, when you say it like that, I will not conceal anything from you anymore. Truth be told, I have only been able to live up till now by relying on some things left behind by our Ancestor. If I am to leave the Poison Demon&rsquo;s Valley, I will not be able to live for more than a month; I will definitely die.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, if I am to stay in the Poison Demon&rsquo;s Valley, I will be able to continue to live for at least ten more years,&rdquo; Du Xiangyu said.<br>&ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Chu Feng felt that Du Xiangyu was lying. He began to ponder the matter. Upon considering that he had obtained the Fire Immortal Profound Technique here, Chu Feng decided that he would brave this danger and help Du Wanwu this once.<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, little friend Chu Feng, this is already no longer up for you to decide. Truth be told, whether you are willing to help or not, you must still help. Assuming that you still wish to live, that is.&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, Du Xiangyu suddenly revealed a strange smile on her face.<br>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; Hearing those words, Chu Feng became alerted.<br>&ldquo;When you entered the Inheritance Hall, the jade pendant that I gave you not only contained our Du Clan&rsquo;s aura, it also contained a special poison, a Gu poison.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Right now, the Gu poison has already entered your dantian. If you are unable to obtain my antidote within a month&rsquo;s time, your cultivation will definitely be crippled,&rdquo; Du Xiangyu said.<br></p></div>
