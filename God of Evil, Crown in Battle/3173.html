        <h1>Chapter 3172</h1>
        <div> - True Suppression<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that Bai Liluo did not answer him, Qingyu Yunlong asked again, &ldquo;Miss Liluo, I don&rsquo;t understand. Exactly what are you planning?&rdquo;<br>He truly despised Chu Hongyi and his two lackeys from the bottom of his heart. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Bai Liluo, he would definitely not have handed their Cyanfeather Monstrous Beast&rsquo;s title plates to them.<br>However, after Qingyu Yunlong said those words, a burst of chilliness immediately filled the surroundings. That chilliness was so powerful that even though the people there were martial cultivators, they all began to shiver in cold.<br>At the same time, Bai Liluo&rsquo;s voice was heard.<br>&ldquo;Whatever I tell you to do, you do that. Since when did you have so much rubbish to say?&rdquo;<br>Not only was Bai Liluo&rsquo;s voice cold, but when her voice was heard, in addition to Qingyu Yunlong, Qingyu Yunhu and the others from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan also felt their hearts tensing up. In fact, at that very instant, they all began to sweat cold sweat.<br>The reason for that was because Bai Liluo&rsquo;s words actually contained killing intent.<br>&ldquo;I am truly sorry. Miss Liluo, I didn&rsquo;t have any other intentions. Please don&rsquo;t take offense.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;From now on, I will act per your orders, and will never ask another question.&rdquo;<br>Deeply frightened, Qingyu Yunlong immediately bowed and began to apologize to Bai Liluo. In fact, his voice was even trembling. From this, it could be seen that he was truly frightened by Bai Liluo.<br>Frightened, how could he not be frightened? After all, that was Bai Liluo.<br>Qingyu Yunlong began to regret his questioning the moment he sensed that chilliness.<br>Before this monster, he should only obey her every command. Why had he decided to speak out of turn and question her decision?<br>Bai Liluo ignored Qingyu Yunlong's apology. However, she retrieved her chilliness.<br>As the chilliness had dissipated, the crowd realized that Bai Liluo had stopped being angry.<br>At that moment, the crowd's nervousness was finally able to ease. No one dared to question Bai Liluo's decisions anymore. They all began to continue with their journey.<br>In the blink of an eye, Qingyu Yunlong and the others arrived outside the main city.<br>After Qingyu Yunlong and the others arrived, they did not immediately attack the city. Instead, they stopped in the sky outside the main city.<br>Furthermore, they did not conceal themselves either. Just like that, they openly appeared outside the main city.<br>With the situation being like that, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen soon discovered the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen.<br>"This is bad! This is bad! It's the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan and the Burnfield Monstrous Clan!"<br>"Heavens! The two people leading them, they seem to be the Dragon and Tiger Brothers!"<br>"Oh no! The Burnfield Monstrous Clansmen not only sought the help of the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan, but they've even managed to request the brothers Qingyu Yunlong and Qingyu Yunhu, two Martial Immortal-level experts!"<br>"We're doomed, we're definitely doomed now!"<br>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were all frightened witless. This was especially true after they saw the Dragon and Tiger Brothers; they felt as if a calamity had befallen them.<br>However, at that moment, Chu Feng stood forward and spoke confidently, "Don't panic, they won&rsquo;t be able to harm us."<br>"Little brother Chu Feng, what do you mean by that?"<br>Seeing this, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen all revealed confused expressions.<br>Although Chu Feng was very strong, they did not feel that he would be able to handle the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan's Dragon and Tiger Brothers.<br>In fact, Chu Feng was indeed no match for them.<br>"Everyone, rest assured. Trust me, they will definitely not be able to harm us," Chu Feng spoke very confidently.<br>The reason why Chu Feng was so confident was because Chu Feng had not only grasped a grand defensive formation, but he had also activated it before the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen approached the city.<br>Merely, the grand defensive formation was invisible.<br>Thus, it was not only the people from the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan and the Burnfield Monstrous Clan that were unable to see it; even the Chu Heavenly Clansmen were unable to see the grand defensive formation.<br>In fact, even Chu Feng was unable to see the grand defensive formation.<br>Although he was unable to see it, Chu Feng was able to feel it. That was the reason why Chu Feng was so very confident.<br>"Chu Feng, exactly what is going on here? You should tell us the reason, no?"<br>"That's right. Little brother Chu Feng, why are you so certain that they will not be able to harm us?"<br>At that moment, it was not only the others, even Chu Huanyu and Chu Shuangshuang were unable to keep themselves from questioning Chu Feng's confidence.<br>After all, the ones that had come to attack them were the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clan. Furthermore, they had learned how powerful the Dragon and Tiger Brothers were from their Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>With the situation being like that, they were truly unable to stay calm.<br>"Reason? It's actually very simple. That's because this is our Chu Heavenly Clan's territory. In this place, no one will be able to harm us," Chu Feng spoke with a smile.<br>However, Chu Feng still did not give the crowd an answer.<br>The crowd began to question Chu Feng repeatedly as to what his trump card was. However, Chu Feng never gave them an answer. He wanted to keep the Chu Heavenly Clansmen in suspense. He also wanted to keep the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen in suspense.<br>The reason for that was because he knew very well that the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen were capable of hearing their conversations. If Chu Feng were to mention the grand defensive formation, the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen would know about it.<br>Should that happen, things would not be interesting.<br>Sure enough, even though the Cyanfeather Monstrous Clansmen did not immediately attack the city, they were monitoring everything in it. As such, they all heard the conversations between Chu Feng and the others.<br>"Big brother, that Chu Feng is truly arrogant."<br>"He already saw us. Yet, he is not only not panicking, but he&rsquo;s even acting so calm and composed, and repeating that we won&rsquo;t be able to cause them harm. He&rsquo;s simply not placing us brothers in his eyes," Qingyu Yunhu spoke in a very displeased manner.<br>"He's nothing more than a clown. He will soon know fear."<br>Compared to Qingyu Yunhu, Qingyu Yunlong completely disapproved of Chu Feng's confidence. He firmly believed that Chu Feng would inevitably kneel before him should he attack him.<br>He felt that Chu Feng was only able to be so arrogantly confident because he had yet to witness the strength that they possessed.<br>"I truly wish to teach that bastard a lesson," Qingyu Yunhu said.<br>"Don't be anxious, let's listen to Miss Liluo," Qingyu Yunlong said.<br>Hearing those words, Qingyu Yunhu spoke no more.<br>The main reason as to why they did not immediately attack the city upon arriving was because of Bai Liluo's command.<br>They would act according to Bai Liluo's instructions.<br>They did not dare to go against Bai Liluo's instructions.<br>Moreover, they actually felt her method to be very interesting, for her method was an actual suppression of the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br></p></div>
