        <div> - Deliberately Making Things Difficult<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, this is bad. That Han Yu is looking at you with an abnormal gaze. Likely, he will attempt to attack you in the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain. After all, only people from the younger generation are able to enter that maze formation. It would serve as an exceptionally good opportunity for him to take care of you.&rdquo;<br><br>Her Lady Queen had also noticed Han Yu&rsquo;s gaze. She was unable to keep herself from warning Chu Feng.<br><br>At that moment, Chu Feng was finally unable to contain himself. Thus, he sent a voice transmission to Xia Yun&rsquo;er, &ldquo;Hey, girl, isn&rsquo;t it excessive for you to toy with me like this?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Young master Chu Feng, what are you talking about?&rdquo;<br><br>Xia Yun&rsquo;er replied to Chu Feng with a voice transmission. At the same time, she looked to Chu Feng with an innocent expression in her large eyes.<br><br>Her appearance seemed to be saying that she truly had no idea what Chu Feng meant.<br><br>&ldquo;Forget about it. Don&rsquo;t bother asking her anymore, that girl is deliberately trying to mess with you. She will only pretend to be stupid when you ask her about it,&rdquo; Her Lady Queen said.<br><br>Chu Feng felt what Her Lady Queen said to be very reasonable. After all, this girl Xia Yun&rsquo;er had acted stupid from the very beginning. Thus, Chu Feng decided to not bother asking her anymore.<br><br>After making their decisions, Chu Feng and the others began to proceed toward the direction of the maze formation.<br><br>After all, it was soon to be the time when Buried Spirit Lake would erupt. Since they planned to enter Buried Spirit Lake, they would have to hurry to make it in time.<br><br>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;<br><br>Right at that moment, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder who was guarding the path to the maze formation suddenly stopped Chu Feng, Xia Yun&rsquo;er and the others.<br><br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br><br>&ldquo;Only after passing through the examination will one be able to enter this path,&rdquo; That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br><br>&ldquo;Examination? We&rsquo;ve never heard of such a rule before,&rdquo; Li Xiang and the others said in a puzzled manner.<br><br>&ldquo;I might as well tell you all the truth. This rule is something that our clan&rsquo;s clan chief has just relayed to us,&rdquo; That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan said.<br><br>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you all deliberately trying to make things difficult for us?&rdquo; Elder Xingyi felt very displeased.<br><br>&ldquo;Truth be told, this rule is precisely created for you all. As for the reason why, I believe you all already know it in your hearts,&rdquo; That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br><br>Chu Feng and the others naturally understood what he meant by that. The reason for that was because Chu Feng and the others had already come to find out about the secret regarding the two paths before them. That was why the Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan was deliberately making things difficult for them now.<br><br>&ldquo;In that case, may I know what sort of examination it will be?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br><br>&ldquo;Do you see this ball?&rdquo; That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief flipped his palm. Then, a transparent glass ball appeared on his palm.<br><br>&ldquo;As long as you instill spirit power into this ball, the color of the ball will change.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;As long as the ball turns cyan, you will have passed the examination and be allowed to enter this path.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;This ball will also become the pass for you all to enter the maze formation. If you do not have this ball, then you will not be able to enter the maze formation.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Furthermore, this ball will also provide you with certain clues. Those clues will be beneficial to finding the exit of the maze formation that leads to Buried Spirit Lake.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Of course, cyan is merely the color needed to enter the maze formation. Thus, the clues that one will obtain after achieving that color will be very slight. If one is able to achieve the color purple, then one will obtain a few more clues. If gold, the clues will be even more beneficial,&rdquo; That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br><br>&ldquo;Then, senior, may I ask what color would be the highest color?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br><br>&ldquo;The highest will be golden. However, you all must not look down on this ball. It is capable of engulfing much more spirit power than you could ever imagine.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Thus, what you all need to do is pray that you will be able to turn it cyan. As for the golden color, do not even think about it,&rdquo; That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br><br>There were traces of contempt in his words. He did not believe that Chu Feng and the others would be able to turn the glass ball golden.<br><br>At that moment, Han Yu said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking down on us too much, no?&rdquo;<br><br>He was very confident. Furthermore, he revealed his spirit power as he spoke.<br><br>His spirit power was very brilliant.<br><br>At that moment, he was completely engulfed by his spirit power, and looked like a god descending upon the world of mortals.<br><br>Most importantly, not only was his spirit power Immortal-cloak, but there were actually dragon marks flowing through it.<br><br>&ldquo;Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, amazing!&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;As expected from Han Yu, he has actually reached the state of Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist already. Truly unfathomable.&rdquo;<br><br>Upon seeing Han Yu&rsquo;s spirit power, many of the people present revealed shock in their eyes.<br><br>Even the gazes of the Starfall Eight Immortals changed somewhat.<br><br>The reason for that was because, in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, extremely few people of the younger generation within a hundred years of age would be able to become Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists. Their numbers could even be said to be capable of being counted with one&rsquo;s hands.<br><br>Furthermore, the great majority of those that managed to become Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists within a hundred years of age were people that had wholly focused themselves in training world spirit techniques. Thus, their attainments in the field of martial cultivation were generally far inferior.<br><br>However, Han Yu was a demon-level genius in terms of martial cultivation too. After all, he was someone who had managed to leave his name on the Demon-level Geniuses List.<br><br>As the saying goes, one could not separate one&rsquo;s concentration on two different tasks. With how exceptional Han Yu had managed to be in the field of martial cultivation, he should logically be inferior in terms of world spirit techniques.<br><br>Yet, he actually managed to obtain such achievements in terms of world spirit techniques too. This was something that would naturally cause others to be astonished and feel admiration.<br><br>Hearing the gasps of surprise and praises from the crowd, and feeling the gazes of adoration and admiration from the younger generations, Han Yu finally revealed a proud smile again.<br><br>Ever since Xia Yun&rsquo;er appeared, he had been completely suppressed by Chu Feng. After all, Xia Yun&rsquo;er was walking so close to him.<br><br>But now, he felt that he had finally managed to recover some lost ground. At the very least, he was no longer so passive.<br><br>The reason for that was because he was certain about one thing. He was certain that not only was his cultivation the strongest among all the younger generations present, but his world spirit techniques were also the strongest among all the younger generations present.<br><br>&ldquo;Those who wish to enter the maze formation can come over to me and retrieve a sphere.&rdquo;<br><br>Right at that moment, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder spoke. Even though Han Yu had indeed managed to astonish the crowd and gain their focus after revealing his strength as a Dragon Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder did not concern himself with him at all.<br><br>Chu Feng and the others did not hesitate. One by one, they proceeded toward that Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder and retrieved a glass ball from him.<br><br>&ldquo;Remember, you will only have a single opportunity. After you begin to instill your spirit power into your ball, you must not stop. If you are to stop, you will not have a second opportunity.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Furthermore, you will only have a single incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time to instill your spirit power into the ball. After a single incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time is up, the balls will stop accepting your spirit power,&rdquo; That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br><br>&ldquo;Such a short period of time? That&rsquo;s simply not enough time at all,&rdquo; At that moment, many members of the younger generation voiced their dissatisfaction.<br><br>&ldquo;The requirement for world spiritists is to be proficient in their utilization of their spirit power. To instill a great amount of spirit power into the balls in a short period of time will test whether or not you all are proficient in your world spirit techniques. If you are unable to accomplish it, that would only mean that you are too weak, and still not qualified to be a world spiritist,&rdquo; That Ancient Era&rsquo;s Serpent Clan&rsquo;s elder said.<br><br>&ldquo;Heh&hellip; a single incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time is more than sufficient.&rdquo;<br><br>Right at that moment, Han Yu started to smile. Then, he sat down cross-legged on the ground. With a wave of his sleeve, he sealed himself with a spirit formation.<br><br>The people outside were unable to see him inside that spirit formation. However, they were able to guess that Han Yu must&rsquo;ve begun to instill his spirit power into the ball. Seeing that Han Yu had already begun, the others all grew anxious.<br><br>They no longer hesitated, and immediately began to instill their own spirit power into their respective glass balls.<br><br>Once they began, they paid no attention to anything else. The reason for that was because they had to make an all-out effort to succeed. After all, they would only have a single incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time. To them, this was an enormous test.<br><br>Seeing that the great majority of the people present had started instilling their spirit power into their glass balls, Li Xiang and his two companions prepared to do the same themselves.<br><br>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;<br><br>However, right at the moment when Li Xiang and his two companions were about to start, Chu Feng suddenly spoke to stop them.<br><br><br><br><br></p></div>
