        <div>: A Reckless Decision<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This phenomenon shocked Xian Miaomiao, but even so, she kept her eyes firmly locked on the wooden box. She saw a fist-sized green sphere inside it. It was wriggling around as if it possessed a life of its own.<br>Green aura was diffusing from the sphere.<br>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao asked with a slightly hoarse tone.<br>She was so overwhelmed by the presence of the green sphere that her voice cracked a little.<br>&ldquo;As a member of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, you should have heard of Soul Fog, right?&rdquo; Song Changsheng asked.<br>&ldquo;Soul Fog? I did hear my mother mention it once. Back then, the Nine Souls Sacred Clan was able to rise to a dominant position due to its possession of Soul Fog, but it later disappeared&hellip; My gosh! Master, th-th-this&hellip; It can&rsquo;t be the legendary Soul Fog, is it?&rdquo;<br>Xian Miaomiao stared at Song Changsheng with widened eyes.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s indeed made out of Soul Fog, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be accurate to call it Soul Fog. The power it harnesses far exceeds that of Soul Fog. It took me quite a bit of effort to construct it,&rdquo; Song Changsheng said.<br>He was the only one in the world who knew how much he had to sacrifice in order to construct this green sphere, but he quickly turned his eyes toward Xian Miaomiao.<br>&ldquo;Miaomiao, Soul Fog is high compatible with the Nine Souls Sacred Clan&rsquo;s bloodline. You should be able to enhance your bloodline by assimilating it. That&rsquo;ll allow you to not only catch up with him but even surpass him in the short run.<br>&ldquo;Of course, assimilating this item won&rsquo;t be easy. It&rsquo;ll be dangerous. Even if you succeed, you&rsquo;ll only remain on par with him in the short run. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the gap between the two of them starts widening once more, but the gap shouldn&rsquo;t be that big,&rdquo; Song Changsheng said.<br>&ldquo;Master, I wish to give it a try,&rdquo; Xian Miaomiao gave her response.<br>Seeing the serious look on Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s face, Song Changsheng&rsquo;s lips curled into a smile. The truth was that he had prepared this green sphere for himself, but listening to Xian Miaomiao&rsquo;s words induced an urge in him to entrust this item over to her.<br>He wasn&rsquo;t certain whether he would regret this decision, but this was what his heart was telling him right now.<br>&hellip;<br>The following morning, Chu Feng got ready to leave the Nine Souls Sacred Clan and head to the Monstrous Spirit Clan. He did promise the Monstrous Spirit Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to bring the puppet army back even though it was currently incomplete.<br>He noticed that 32 of the puppets were missing, but he was still duty-bound to deliver the puppet army back to its owner.<br>Besides, now that he knew what the familiar feeling was, he had a strong feeling that the man worshiped by the Monstrous Spirit Clan was related to the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Sect. Even if that wasn&rsquo;t the case, that military seal that was used to construct the puppet army was likely to be a treasure from the Celestial Master&rsquo;s Sacred Clan.<br>Thus, he wanted to take a look around the Monstrous Spirit Clan and see if he could find anything.<br>But just as he was about to leave, a few guests arrived at his doorstep. They were Shengguang Baimei, Shengguang Buyu, and Daoist Niantian.<br>&ldquo;Young hero Chu Feng, I heard that you managed to defeat those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect with the help of the Asura Evil Spirits from the Asura Graveyard? You&rsquo;re incredible!&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei spoke excitedly.<br>They had already heard about what happened.<br>&ldquo;Elder, please don&rsquo;t say that. It was all luck.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt a little uncomfortable with the compliment, so he could only answer humbly. He quickly changed the topic and asked.<br>&ldquo;Elders, are you the only ones who came?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words brought awkward looks onto Shengguang Baimei and Shengguang Buyu&rsquo;s faces. They knew what he was asking here. They had previously returned to the Holy Valley to request help from the strongest expert of the Holy Light Clan, the Holy Monarch.<br>Shengguang Buyu was the first one to leave, followed by Shengguang Baimei and Daoist Niantian. Their goals were the same.<br>Now that they were here, it would only make sense if the Holy Monarch was here with them. However&hellip;<br>&ldquo;Is the Holy Monarch still in closed-door training?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>He could tell from their expressions that the Holy Monarch didn&rsquo;t come with them.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, we have let you down. I was useless,&rdquo; Shengguang Baimei said with a remorseful sigh.<br>He quickly explained what happened.<br>After they returned to the Holy Valley, they immediately informed the Holy Monarch about the situation and requested the Holy Monarch to come out of his closed-door training. However, the Holy Monarch told them to wait instead.<br>They spent all this time waiting for the Holy Monarch, and it was only in the last few days that he finally came out of his closed-door training.<br>Without any hesitation, they explained everything that had happened in the Nine Souls Galaxy. However, after learning of the situation, the Holy Monarch simply said, &ldquo;There is no need for us to interfere in the affairs of the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.&rdquo;<br>Leaving those words behind, he went back to his closed-door training.<br>Seeing that the Holy Monarch wasn&rsquo;t going to make a move, Shengguang Baimei and the others could only secretly return here on their own. To their relief, they soon learned that Chu Feng had driven off those from the Pill Dao Immortal Sect with the Asura World Spirit Army.<br>They then asked around and learned that Chu Feng was still in the Nine Souls Sacred Clan, so they came over to pay him a visit.<br>&ldquo;Is the Holy Monarch acquainted with Song Changsheng?&rdquo; Chu Feng murmured under his breath.<br>The phrasing of the Holy Monarch&rsquo;s words was a little weird. It didn&rsquo;t seem like he was averse to helping the Nine Souls Sacred Clan but he thought that someone else would be able to resolve this matter.<br>However, this was just his conjecture, and it wasn&rsquo;t his place to talk about Song Changsheng either. So, he consoled Shengguang Baimei and the others so that they wouldn&rsquo;t feel burdened by this matter.<br>The crisis was over, and Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t think that it was right to blame them here. After all, they had already tried their best to help.<br>Afterward, Chu Feng left the Nine Souls Sacred Clan together with the Lady of Dao Sea, Wang Yuxian, and the others. But right before he left, he made a request with the Nine Souls Sacred Clan.<br></p></div>
