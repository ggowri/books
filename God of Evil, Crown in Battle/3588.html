        <div> - Sacred Fruit<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, I am fine. That dark black gate was merely a test too. Although it was very difficult, it&rsquo;s clear that it was unable to baffle me.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That said, this Sacred Palace Hall will, sooner or later, be closed. Thus, this junior earnestly requests for you to start training again so as to not miss out on this opportunity.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he flipped his palm, and a golden fruit appeared in his hand.<br>Seeing the golden fruit, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others present all realized what he meant by those words.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you absolutely must not. You must use that yourself.&rdquo;<br>The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief forcibly pushed the golden fruit back to Chu Feng.<br>It was all thanks to the cultivation resources he had obtained in that Ancient Era&rsquo;s remnant that he was able to gain his current cultivation.<br>The improvement in his cultivation was something that should belong to Chu Feng.<br>Thus, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief felt very ashamed and guilty to begin with. As such, how could he be willing to accept more assistance from him?<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief, I still have more.&rdquo;<br>As Chu Feng spoke, he flipped his palm, and another golden fruit appeared in his hand.<br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s two?&rdquo;<br>Upon seeing the two golden fruits, the crowd and even the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief revealed a look of shock.<br>They knew very well how difficult it was to obtain a golden fruit.<br>&ldquo;Lord Clan Chief.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng gave a golden fruit to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>This time around, the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did not refuse him.<br>Then, Chu Feng handed the other golden fruit to Chu Xuanzhengfa.<br>&ldquo;No, no, Chu Feng, that&rsquo;s too precious. Keep it for yourself, I cannot accept it,&rdquo; like the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had done earlier, Chu Xuanzhengfa immediately refused the golden fruit.<br>&ldquo;Please accept it. I still have more,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;More?&rdquo;<br>The crowd&rsquo;s expressions became complicated upon hearing those words. A single golden fruit was already extremely difficult to obtain. Could Chu Feng really possess three?<br>It was not only the others that were skeptical. Even Chu Xuanzhengfa did not believe him.<br>However, to the crowd&rsquo;s surprise, Chu Feng streaked his palm across his Cosmos Sack and really took out another golden fruit.<br>&ldquo;He really had another one?&rdquo;<br>The crowd opened their mouths wide with shock.<br>Even Chu Xuanzhengfa reacted the same way. Before he could properly react to it, Chu Feng had forcibly placed a golden fruit into his hand.<br>Then, Chu Feng handed the other golden fruit to their Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Supreme Elder, Chu Hanpeng.<br>Chu Hanpeng wanted to refuse. However, after seeing Chu Feng&rsquo;s determined look, he said jokingly, &ldquo;Unless you have more, this old man will not accept it.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng smiled. Then, he really took out another golden fruit.<br>At that moment, the crowd were no longer simply shocked. The reason for that was because Chu Feng showed no signs of stopping after handing a golden fruit to the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Chu Xuanzhengfa, and Chu Hanpeng.<br>He arrived before three other people.<br>Those three people were all subordinates of Chu Xuanzhengfa, people from the Law Enforcement Hall.<br>They were people that Chu Feng knew. They were called Chu Xingtian, Chu Xingde, and Chu Xingren.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly have more, right?&rdquo; Chu Xingtian asked.<br>&ldquo;Senior is truly clever,&rdquo; as Chu Feng spoke, he took out three golden fruits and handed them to the three of them respectively.<br>&ldquo;Exactly how many golden fruits did that Chu Feng obtain?&rdquo;<br>The crowd were no longer merely envious. Instead, they felt jealousy, deep jealousy.<br>Those golden fruits were capable of allowing one to ascend to the so-called Void Seats.<br>As for those Void Seats, they possessed natural energies visible to the naked eye. From this, one could imagine what sort of sacred cultivation ground it was.<br>Before Chu Feng, apart from the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen, only the Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, Tantai Yinjian, Li Ruochu and Kong Tianhui had golden fruits.<br>However, Chu Feng had taken out six golden fruits all on his own.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng raised his arm, and thirty golden lights flew out from his Cosmos Sack.<br>Those were thirty golden fruits!!!<br>After Chu Feng gave six golden fruits to his Chu Heavenly Clansmen, he actually took out thirty more golden fruits.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you&hellip; where did you obtain all those golden fruits?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, would you be willing to sell a golden fruit to this old man? Give me a price, as long as it&rsquo;s not too excessive, this old man will be able to accept any price.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, sell me one. I&rsquo;ll exchange treasures for it.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sell it to me, sell it to me.&rdquo;<br>The bystanders burst into an uproar.<br>At the same time as they felt jealousy and envy toward Chu Feng, they also saw hope in him.<br>They no longer had the heart to wonder where he had obtained so many golden fruits.<br>At that moment, they only wanted to acquire one.<br>They wanted to purchase golden fruits from Chu Feng using high prices.<br>&ldquo;These golden fruits are only for my clansmen. I&rsquo;m not selling any.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s words brought despair to the crowd.<br>Most bitter of all, Chu Feng actually really ended up giving twenty-nine of his golden fruits to the Chu Heavenly Clansmen.<br>Seeing that, the crowd felt furious and helpless.<br>They&rsquo;d risked their lives to get to the palace Hall. However, evidently, the greatest victor was not them, but rather the Chu Heavenly Clan.<br>&ldquo;Seniors, our time here is limited. You should make the most of it, and start training,&rdquo; Chu Feng said to his seniors of the Chu Heavenly Clan after giving them golden fruits.<br>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clansmen no longer hesitated. One after another, they soared onto the stone chairs floating in midair.<br>With golden fruits in hand, they all successfully managed to ascend to the stone chairs.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng turned his gaze to the floating seat that differed from all the others, the one Zhang Yanfeng had called the Sacred Tree Throne.<br>&ldquo;Young friend Chu Feng, you&rsquo;re also someone that has experienced the power of the Sacred Tree. You should know how difficult it is to ascend to that Sacred Tree Throne. Unless you possess the legendary Sacred Fruit, otherwise&hellip; you will not be able to approach it.&rdquo;<br>Before Chu Feng could even move, someone immediately splashed a bucket of cold water on him.<br>It was the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Sacred Fruit, what is that?&rdquo;<br>The crowd all grew curious after hearing the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief&rsquo;s words. They realized that they truly knew too little about the Void Sacred Tree.<br>Compared to the others, Chu Feng remained completely composed. He opened his hand and asked, &ldquo;Senior, the Sacred Fruit that you spoke of, is it this?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is!!!&rdquo;<br>The Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was immediately stupefied upon seeing the golden fruit in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand.<br>That golden fruit was completely different from all the others. Not only was its appearance different, but even the aura it emitted was different.<br>The other golden fruits emitted an extraordinary air, but that golden fruit emitted the airs of a ruler!!!<br>Even though the Blood-devouring Demon Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had never seen a Sacred Fruit before, he was certain that the golden fruit in Chu Feng&rsquo;s hand was that legendary Sacred Fruit the moment he saw it.<br></p></div>
