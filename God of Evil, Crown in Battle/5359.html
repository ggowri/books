        <div><span>: The Difference Between the Two</span><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br><span>Chu Feng chuckled softly and said, &ldquo;My psyche is indeed much stronger than ordinary people.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;Looks like I&rsquo;m an ordinary person in big brother Chu Feng&rsquo;s eyes too,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said with a chortle.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misunderstand. There&rsquo;s no way you&rsquo;re an ordinary person,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m joking! Though I honestly don&rsquo;t think that I can be considered a prodigy compared to you. Looks like we&rsquo;ll definitely win the bet at this rate. I bet that Jie Yu didn&rsquo;t see this coming. I&rsquo;d love to see his face when he loses. Let&rsquo;s see if he still dares to talk big before </span><span>me!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>Having crossed blows with Jie Yu before, he knew that the latter was around the same level as him. Jie Yu was indubitably a prodigy, but he wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance against a monster of Chu Feng&rsquo;s caliber.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Still, we shouldn&rsquo;t get careless. We know too little about this place,&rdquo; Chu Feng said. His many encounters with danger had taught him the importance of staying vigilant.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Big brother, how are you able to remain humble when you&rsquo;re already this powerful? I have much to learn from you,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>He found it charismatic how Chu Feng continued to maintain a low profile despite his strength, and it left him wondering if he would be more credible if he carried himself like the latter.</span><br><span>The two of them advanced on.</span><br><span>They passed by a cavern, a long passageway, a palace, and many other places. A test was waiting for them in each of these places, Chu Feng would do his best to fully satisfy its requirementbefore proceeding ahead.</span><br><span>He simply didn&rsquo;t have sufficient information about the trial, so he had no choice but to resort to the dumbest method, which was to do everything to his very best.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing noticed that the tests were becoming increasingly demanding on one&rsquo;s psyche. To avoid becoming a burden, he curbed his outflow of psyche to preserve his strength as far as possible. This way, he could ensure that he would reach the end while retaining sufficient psyche to refine the crystal into a cultivation resource.</span><br><span>But things didn&rsquo;t go as he wished.</span><br><span>The two of them had just reached the location of the next t</span><br><span>. It was a sinister red palace, but unlike the previous t</span><br><span>s, there was no suction force here that devoured their psyche. On the contrary, a powerful force was restricting the amount of psyche they could release.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What the hell! What should I do, big brother Chu Feng? Why is it not consuming my psyche anymore? Is the trial acting weird because we&rsquo;re reaching the endpoint? Jie Yu will laugh at me if he sees that I haven&rsquo;t even fully refined my crystal!&rdquo; Bai Yunqing panicked.</span><br><span>He wanted to release all of his psyche at the very end, but the test suddenly turned around and restricted the outflow of his psyche instead. This meant that he couldn&rsquo;t exchange his psyche for the cultivation resource anymore!</span><br><span>It was simply too embarrassing if he cleared the trial without even getting a chance to properly refine his crystal.</span><br><span>&ldquo;No worries. There&rsquo;ll be a way for us to clear this test,&rdquo; Chu Feng calmly replied.</span><br><span>Using his finger as a brush, he drew out a spirit power circulation method in mid-air and said, &ldquo;Use this method to channel your spirit power, then try to release your psyche.&rdquo;</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing immediately did as he was told. To his delight, he was able to release his psyche once he employed Chu Feng&rsquo;s method, and the sinister red palace still devoured </span><span>his psyche as long as he was able to release it.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It works! Thanks, big brother Chu Feng,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing exclaimed in delight.</span><br><span>Not going to let the second chance he was given go to waste, he frenziedly released his psyche to feed his crystal. His crystal quickly turned white, then gray; before long, it started showing a blue tinge.</span><br><span>But he knew that this was far from enough. Chu Feng&rsquo;s crystal was already emanating a divine aura, having reached the level of Immortal Dragon Mark. Even if he couldn&rsquo;t reach Chu Feng&rsquo;s level, he must at least not pale in comparison to Jie Yu.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t release all your psyche. Keep half of it,&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Upon hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words, Bai Yunqing hurriedly controlled his psyche output. Once he reached half capacity for his psyche, he stopped and said, &ldquo;Big brother, I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo;</span><br><span>It was only then that Chu Feng began releasing his psyche. It didn&rsquo;t take him long for him to satisfy the red palace, and the tightly-shut doors at the opposite end of the room creaked open.</span><br><span>Another palace awaited them at the other side of the gate, just that it was even more unnerving. It was entirely black in color, looking almost like a black hole.</span><br><span>As soon as the two of them stepped into the black palace, the doors behind them slammed shut, sealing their path of retreat.</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s face paled.</span><br><span>As soon as he stepped in, a powerful suction force enveloped him and furiously siphoned away his psyche. To make things worse, he couldn&rsquo;t stop his psyche from flowing out at all!</span><br><span>This reminded him of Chu Feng&rsquo;s earlier warning, and he looked at the latter with grateful eyes.</span><br><span>He had previously intended to just retain the bare minimum of psyche required for him to clear the subsequent tests because the red palace had alerted him to the possibility that he might not have a chance to expend his psyche afterward. He thought that it would be fine since he could simply control his outflow of psyche.</span><br><span>In fact, he thought that Chu Feng had only told him to retain half his psyche earlier on because he wanted to fill up the red palace himself. After all, the final reward was proportionate to the amount of psyche they expended here.</span><br><span>It was only now that he realized that he was grievously wrong.</span><br><span>Chu Feng must have already sensed the danger lurking ahead, which was why he reminded him of such. Bai Yunqing was glad that he had done as he was told, or else his lack of psyche would have threatened his life here.</span><br><span>He felt remorseful for having thought that Chu Feng was a selfish person.</span><br><span>Pah!</span><br><span>Bai Yunqing gave himself a tight slap to punish himself for having such thoughts.</span><br><span>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Chu Feng was confused by Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s sudden act of self-</span><span>harm.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m punishing myself for my foolishness. It&rsquo;s fortunate big brother is with me, or else I would have been a goner,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said with a smile.</span><br><span>He didn&rsquo;t reveal the truth because he was too embarrassed to say that he had second-guessed Chu Feng&rsquo;s goodwill.</span><br><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re brothers; there&rsquo;s no need for such words between us. Do you have enough psyche? Tell me if you don&rsquo;t have enough,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>He was worried that Bai Yunqing would be in danger from having insufficient psyche. If that were the case, he would have to increase his psyche output and quickly satisfy the black palace.</span><br><span>&ldquo;I have enough for the time being,&rdquo; Bai Yunqing replied. &ldquo;But big brother Chu Feng, how did you know that this would be the next test? Most world spiritists would have found a way to overcome the red palace&rsquo;s psyche blockage to clear that test, but they would have probably wondered if the blockage would get worse in the subsequent tests, thus prompting them to quickly use up their psyche. Otherwise, they might risk losing out on the reward.&rdquo;</span><br><span>&ldquo;I thought the red palace was likely to be a trap to mislead us into depleting our psyche,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Were there any clues in the red palace?&rdquo; Bai Yunqing said.</span><br><span>&ldquo;Not at all. It was just a guess,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span><br><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky that big brother Chu Feng is here, or else I would have fallen for that trap.&rdquo; Bai Yunqing shook his head with a bitter smile.</span><br><span>He was no newcomer when it came to tests, having visited many remnants with his master, but he knew that he was still lacking compared to Chu Feng.</span><br></p></div>
