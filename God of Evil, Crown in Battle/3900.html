        <h1>Chapter 3899</h1>
        <div> - Galewind Hunting Clan<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chu Feng had actually already guessed that the woman who resembled Yan Ruyu had a remarkable status.<br>After witnessing the reaction of those Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms, Chu Feng became even more certain of it.<br>Chu Feng realized that the woman who looked like Yan Ruyu might possess a status even more exceptional than he had imagined.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to fear? Your daddy I am telling you all to speak, so you&rsquo;d best speak. Otherwise, I will snap your heads off.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng spoke very sternly. He even released his oppressive might and killing intent as he spoke.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s killing intent was extraordinary. It was something he had sharpened through countless battles and killings.<br>Although Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power might be inferior to true expert cultivators, his killing intent would not lose out to anyone.<br>Even if Chu Feng were to encounter those old monsters that had lived for thousands of years, they would still tremble with fear before his killing intent.<br>Thus, after Chu Feng unleashed his killing intent, those Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms pissed their pants in terror; they really pissed themselves in terror.<br>Due to the fact that they were wearing very simple outfits, Chu Feng could see the liquid flowing from their bodies.<br>Only a single one of them did not piss himself. It was that fellow by the name of Gou Za.<br>However, that Gou Za was also shivering in fear.<br>&ldquo;Milord, we&rsquo;ll tell you, we&rsquo;ll tell you. Please don&rsquo;t kill us.&rdquo;<br>Being threatened by Chu Feng, they no longer dared to hesitate, and began to tell Chu Feng everything they knew.<br>Chu Feng learned from them that the Ancient Era&rsquo;s organisms had a common name -- the Galewind Hunting Clan.<br>The Galewind Hunting Clan was a race that had existed since the Ancient Era.<br>However, they were not humans. If one must describe them, it would be more accurate to say that they were a monstrous beast race from the Ancient Era.<br>The Galewind Hunting Clan was separated into tiers.<br>From the different tiers, they were separated into different clans.<br>From strong to weak, the clans were respectively the Royal Clan, General Clan and Soldier Clan.<br>From their names, one could roughly tell that the Royal Clan was the most noble. They were akin to the royal family.<br>The General Clan served the Royal Clan, and their status surpassed that of the Soldier Clan. They were a bunch that commanded soldiers.<br>As for the Soldier Clan, they could be said to be the lowest rung of the Galewind Hunting Clan ladder.<br>However, even those from the Soldier Clan were extremely noble.<br>Even though they were the bottom rung, they were still warriors.<br>After all, below the Soldier Clan was the People Clan. People Clan naturally referred to ordinary commoners. It was possible for those from the People Clan to become one of the Soldier Clan. Once they became a soldier, they would be able to alter their family name and, most importantly, change the status of their descendants.<br>However, there was actually an even lower clan beneath the People Clan -- the Dog Clan.<br>The people before Chu Feng were all from the Dog Clan.<br>Thus, it was actually not their names that were weird. Instead, the people from the Dog Clan all had to be surnamed Gou. That was a hard-line rule. If anyone were to refuse to follow that rule, they would be beheaded.<br>[1. Gou means Dog.]<br>The people of the Dog Clan were all descendants of people who had made major blunders, and had been demoted and made to carry the surname Dog.<br>Take the people before Chu Feng for example. They were born into the Dog Clan even though they hadn&rsquo;t made any mistakes. It was instead their seniors that had made the mistake that diminished them.<br>From this, it could be seen that those from the Dog Clan were very pitiful.<br>Should they fall into the Dog Clan, they would remain in the Dog Clan for generations. No matter how powerful their cultivations might be, they would still not be able to escape the stigma.<br>That was the punishment that the Galewind Hunting Clan set out for those that committed serious crimes. Even their descendants would have to suffer for what they&rsquo;d done.<br>Thus, after learning of the identity of the Dog Clan, Chu Feng began to feel some pity for Gou Za and others.<br>The reason for that was because he had remembered himself of the past.<br>Back then, hadn't he also been discarded by the Chu Heavenly Clan?<br>As for the woman who greatly resembled Yan Ruyu, she belonged to the Royal Clan.<br>Not only that, but she was the princess of the Royal Clan.<br>That was the reason why those Dog Clansmen were so afraid.<br>In the Galewind Hunting Clan, those from the Royal Clan would only be together with others from the Royal Clan. The princess of the Royal Clan was someone of incomparable nobility. Not even the people from the General Clans dared to think of them.<br>Thus, how could any other lower clans possibly dare have any thoughts for the Royal Clan&rsquo;s princess?<br>&ldquo;Milord, if we are not mistaken, Milord should be from the Soldier Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;If you want to know of your identity, you should be able to learn about it merely by returning to the Soldier Nation and making some inquiries there,&rdquo; said that Gou Za fellow.<br>&ldquo;Soldier Clan? You all feel that my strength will only qualify me for the Soldier Clan?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Eh&hellip; this lowly one didn&rsquo;t intend to offend Milord.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s merely that, from the oppressive might Milord released earlier, if this lowly one isn&rsquo;t mistaken, Milord should be an Exalted, right?&rdquo; asked that Gou Za.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. What about it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although your daddy has lost his memory, your daddy knows that his cultivation is called rank eight Exalted,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Chu Feng had not utilize the power of the spirit formation when he'd released his oppressive might earlier.<br>He had deliberately concealed the power of the spirit formation because he didn&rsquo;t want to reveal too much.<br>Thus, that Gou Za had actually guessed correctly. The oppressive might Chu Feng had released earlier was indeed that of an Exalted.<br>Chu Feng actually felt some admiration for Gou Za and the others when they managed to guess his cultivation.<br>After all, they were only Heavenly Immortals. It was actually amazing that they were able to determine Chu Feng to be an Exalted from his oppressive might at their level of cultivation.<br>After all, even Chu Feng had been unable to determine if someone was an Exalted when he was a Heavenly Immortal.<br>&ldquo;So Milord is actually a rank eight Exalted. Milord is actually that powerful. In that case, Milord&rsquo;s status in the Soldier Clan must be very high. Milord will definitely be able to find out his identity should he return to the Soldier Nation.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, Milord, once you return to the Soldier Country, you must not mention your liking for the Royal Clan&rsquo;s princess. Otherwise, it will not only be Milord, but even your family will meet a great catastrophe," said that Gou Za.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that even a rank eight Exalted like me is unable to enter the General Clan?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>Compared to Gou Za&rsquo;s warning, Chu Feng was more concerned about the cultivation of the General Clan and Royal Clan.<br>After all, Chu Feng might be challenging that Royal Clan.<br>&ldquo;Milord&rsquo;s cultivation is actually not far from the General Clan. According to this lowly one&rsquo;s knowledge, one will be able to enter the General Clan once one becomes an Utmost Exalted.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, even Milord&rsquo;s family will be able to change their surname and join the General Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Congratulations, Milord.&rdquo;<br>After saying those words, Gou Za and the others began to bow respectfully to congratulate Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Utmost Exalted?&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, Chu Feng came to understand that the threshold for the General Clan would be Utmost Exalted.<br>However, Utmost Exalted was a paramount cultivation in both the Ancestral Martial Starfield and the All-heaven Starfield. They were the top existences in both starfields.<br>It was no wonder that Chu Feng and the Mystic Cave Saints were unable to withstand the oppressive might when they'd encountered the Galewind Hunting Clan hunting the Heaven-reaching Giant Spirit Beasts.<br>&ldquo;In that case, do you know what cultivation one needs to enter the Royal Clan?&rdquo; asked Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;The Royal Clan is paramount. This lowly one doesn&rsquo;t know what cultivation is needed to enter the Royal Clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This lowly one only knows that entering the Royal Clan not only requires an enormous cultivation, but it also requires one to provide meritorious service to our clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;However, after the Ancient Era, our clan has continued to live underground. There has not been any war at all. Thus, even though there are extremely powerful existences in the General Clan, they do not have an opportunity to provide meritorious service to our clan.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Because of that, the members of the Royal Clan are all people that have inherited their titles from since the time of the Ancient Era. Since the end of the Ancient Era, no one has been able to enter the Royal Clan," said Gou Za.<br>&ldquo;No one has entered the Royal Clan?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng narrowed his brows.<br>If the person on the mural was truly Yan Ruyu, and the Galewind Hunting Clan had such a rule, how could Yan Ruyu have become their Royal Clan&rsquo;s princess?<br></p></div>
