        <div> - The Fall Of Geniuses?<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s such a thing?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Clan Chief Tantai, what must they do to come out?&rdquo; Someone asked.<br>&ldquo;Deep in the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound are twenty hidden exits. Although the hidden paths are ever-changing and completely unpredictable, the entrances and exits are generally connected. If they are capable of coming out alive, they will likely exit from the thirteenth exit.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, as far as I know, there has never been anyone capable of exiting from the hidden path of certain death. Furthermore, they will generally meet their doom within an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;There has never been anyone who could last two incense sticks&rsquo; worth of time,&rdquo; said Tantai Xiangnan.<br>&ldquo;In that case, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that the lightning-projected images will disappear in an incense stick&rsquo;s worth of time?&rdquo;<br>Many people felt astonished upon hearing his words.<br>This was especially true in regards to those people with close relationships with Chu Feng. They became even more worried.<br>Of course, Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others continued to remain observant.<br>They were people that had experienced how capable Chu Feng was. What was impossible for others might not necessarily be impossible for him.<br>Time passed quickly. Soon, two incense sticks&rsquo; worth of time had passed.<br>When such a thing happened, Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others&rsquo; worries started to be gradually lifted.<br>According to Tantai Xiangnan, Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie had surpassed the previous record for the longest time spent in the hidden path of death. This served to represent how remarkable they were.<br>Suddenly, someone cried out in alarm, &ldquo;Look, the lightning image has disappeared!&rdquo;<br>Following that, even Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others revealed a clear change in their expressions.<br>It was as that person had stated, the lightning image on the thirteenth entrance had disappeared.<br>&ldquo;My Immortal Martial Stones, wasted in such a manner.&rdquo;<br>Many people sighed and felt great sadness. However, they were not sad because of Chu Feng&rsquo;s death. Instead, they felt feeling sadness for their Immortal Martial Stones.<br>&ldquo;Young friends Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie really died like that?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is truly a pity. A genius like Chu Feng actually fell in such a manner? That is truly a pity. It is a misfortune for our Ancestral Martial Starfield.&rdquo;<br>The people that had witnessed Chu Feng&rsquo;s strength began to regret his death.<br>Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others, on the other hand, were unable to accept this reality. At the same time, they were unwilling to believe this to be true. They were still hopeful that Chu Feng was still alive.<br>After all, they had witnessed his capability. Furthermore, they felt that he was someone with enormous luck and fortune. Someone like that couldn&rsquo;t possibly die so easily. After all, even the heavens looked after him.<br>As for Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie, they were naturally not dead.<br>At that moment, Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie had passed through the region covered in Demon-suppression Incantations.<br>After they exited the region covered in Demon-suppression Incantations, the lightning-projected image outside faded away.<br>Neither Chu Feng nor Wuma Shengjie knew why the lightning-projected image would disappear after they left the region, or appear when they entered that region. In fact, they didn&rsquo;t even know about the lightning-projected image outside.<br>After all, the two of them had no heart to concern themselves with that sort of thing. The reason for that was because the two of them had entered a very dangerous region right after they exited the region covered in Demon-suppression Incantations.<br>The area beneath them was completely pitch-black and bottomless. It was a void with nothing present. However, terrifying roars, shouts and even screams sounded from beneath them nonstop.<br>Those terrifying sounds were filled with resentment. Hearing those sounds, even Wuma Shengjie trembled with fear.<br>Furthermore, the hidden path that they were on was no longer a downward slope. Instead, it was aimed straight downwards. From a glance, it seemed like a tunnel that lead straight to hell. Seeing it, one would shiver with fear.<br>Most despairing of all, it turned out that that hidden path was one where one could only go forward, and not backwards.<br>Even though there were clearly no barriers or spirit formations on their way there, when the two of them tried to fly back up to the relatively safer Demon-suppression Incantations-filled area, they discovered that there was an invisible barrier above them, sealing their path upward.<br>Whenever they went deeper down and tried to return, they would encounter that invisible barrier again.<br>As such, they could not go back anymore.<br>&ldquo;Exactly what is going on here?&rdquo; asked Wuma Shengjie.<br>&ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>&ldquo;Even you cannot see through this place? Exactly&hellip; what sort of place is this?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie stared down below. The unease in her eyes grew even more intense.<br>Chu Feng was currently a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, a very high level world spiritist. Yet, even he was unable to determine what the barrier behind them was. This was sufficient to illustrate how extraordinary the place was.<br>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this place the hidden path of certain death?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked with a smile.<br>&ldquo;How could you smile at a time like this?&rdquo; Seeing the smiling Chu Feng, Wuma Shengjie felt very helpless.<br>Although she knew that it was the hidden path of certain death, she still had some hope after entering. Otherwise, why would she bother to proceed deep into the path in order to explore it? She could&rsquo;ve just committed suicide and saved herself the pain of being tortured.<br>Yet, the situation at hand was now different. Below them were likely very powerful Evil Spirits. They were unable to return the way they had come. If they stayed where they were, they would be discovered by the Evil Spirits sooner or later. At that time, they would not be able to escape death.<br>Thus, Wuma Shengjie was truly unable to understand how Chu Feng could still smile at such a time.<br>&ldquo;Girl, wait for me here. I&rsquo;ll go down and survey the path,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Why? If we&rsquo;re going, then we&rsquo;re going together. Are you implying that I, Wuma Shengjie, am afraid of death?&rdquo; Wuma Shengjie asked.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it. Merely&hellip; careful!!!&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Chu Feng&rsquo;s expression changed enormously. His body immediately shifted and arrived before Wuma Shengjie. As Chu Feng&rsquo;s clothes fluttered, boundless spirit power burst forth from his body like a volcanic eruption.<br>Not only was his Saint-level spirit power dazzling in appearance, but its aura was also very sacred.<br>In an instant, the sacred spirit power formed a barrier before Chu Feng.<br>Wuma Shengjie was confused by his sudden reaction. However, her expression immediately changed. In an alarmed tone, she said, &ldquo;Heavens! That is?!&rdquo;<br>It was a sharp claw. The claw extended from the depths of the hidden path. One could not see the body the claw was connected to. One could only see that its connecting limb extended from the depths of the hidden path. That limb was so long that it was simply beyond measure. Purple hair covered both the claw and the limb. Furthermore, a green gaseous substance was present around both claw and limb, and was emitting a nauseating odor.<br>The limb was not very thick. It was roughly three meters in girth. However, that claw was actually over a hundred meters long. With a claw over a hundred meters long, one could imagine how enormous the body would be.<br>Most importantly, Wuma Shengjie was able to tell that the spirit power Chu Feng unleashed was very strong. It was a power that surpassed the power of Martial Immortals.<br>Yet, cracks had actually appeared in the barrier formed by such powerful spirit power after being crushed by that claw.<br>The cracks were rapidly spreading through the barrier. The barrier could collapse at any moment.<br></p></div>
