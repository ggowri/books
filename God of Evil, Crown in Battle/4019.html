        <h1>Chapter 4018</h1>
        <div> - Day Of Revenge<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Boom~~~&rdquo;<br>Collapse and disintegration.<br>Surging thick smoke.<br>The sight and the sound was akin to the arrival of doomsday, a devastation between heaven and earth.<br>The All-heaven Sect; the power that had ruled over the All-heaven Starfield for tens of thousands of years, was crumbling.<br>All of their buildings were being destroyed. It was like the end of an era.<br>That said, what brought about the greatest amount of terror to the crowd was not witnessing the destruction of buildings that had survived countless years, but rather witnessing bodies turning into bloody mist, and powerless screams turning into nothingness.<br>Zhao Hong began to act. Whilst still torturing the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, she decided to turn her sickle of revenge towards the All-heaven Sect.<br>The All-heaven Sect had been razed to the ground, and all their top experts were killed.<br>Without a doubt, Zhao Hong had unleashed a bloody massacre.<br>However, she did not kill everyone belonging to the All-heaven Sect.<br>The great majority of the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s disciples managed to narrowly escape the calamity. Even for the elders, not all of them were killed by Zhao Hong.<br>It was only later on that the crowd learned that the people that had been killed were all people that had participated in the slaughter of the Reincarnation Sect.<br>Back then, they'd still been very young. However, they&rsquo;d all become old people with time.<br>Regardless of whether they did what they did because they were obeying orders or were ignorant due to their young age, it remained that their hands were dyed with the blood of the members of the Reincarnation Sect.<br>Thus, no one could complain about Zhao Hong deciding to use their blood to pay back the blood they&rsquo;d taken, their lives for the lives they&rsquo;d taken.<br>Nevertheless, the crowd still felt endless terror after personally witnessing the massacre.<br>This was especially true for the elders and disciples from the Wind Lightning Sword Sect and the Nine Stars Heavenly Mountain.<br>Their leaders had already been killed by Zhao Hong. Would they be implicated?<br>Even the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief, the Inferno Academy&rsquo;s headmaster and the Dragon Phoenix Immortal Pavilion&rsquo;s pavilion master, three top experts, were afraid.<br>Even though they&rsquo;d decided to stop pestering Chu Feng, a very sensible choice judging from what had happened, they still did not know if Zhao Hong would spare them.<br>As such, they were also very afraid. After all, the current Zhao Hong possessed the strength to obliterate all of them.<br>Their life and death could be determined by Zhao Hong with a single thought.<br>That said, Zhao Hong did not do anything to them. Her gaze was fixed on the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster the entire time.<br>Even though thick smoke was surging into the sky, only weeping sounds could be heard besides the screams of the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster.<br>The people crying were mostly disciples of the All-heaven Sect.<br>They were mostly young, and did not know about the grievances from back then. However, as they were still disciples of the All-heaven Sect, they had feelings for it. Personally witnessing its end, they found it difficult to endure, and ended up crumbling into bitter tears.<br>However, no one pitied them.<br>The crowd were all concerned for themselves. They were all worried about their own safety, and had no heart to consider other people.<br>The screams of the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster had gone hoarse long ago. His voice had also started growing weaker and weaker.<br>When his screams disappeared completely, Zhao Hong swung her sleeve, and the Blood-sucking Soul-devouring Beast flew back into her sleeve.<br>Looking over to the direction of the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster, only clothes and a pile of blood remained.<br>He had been killed, utterly killed. Not even a single bone remained.<br>However, even after the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s sectmaster died, Zhao Hong did not show any relief on her face.<br>Even though Liu Shuo had died, Zhao Hong did not feel any pleasure from having obtained vengeance. Rather, she had a complicated look on her face.<br>Suddenly, her gaze became chilly again. She swept her eyes towards the Miao Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and the others.<br>&ldquo;Earlier, why did you all make things difficult for him?&rdquo; Zhao Hong asked coldly.<br>The &lsquo;him&rsquo; she spoke of was naturally Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;We do not possess any malice. It was a misunderstanding&hellip;&rdquo;<br>The three starfield&rsquo;s overlords were so terrified that their voices started trembling.<br>They were deeply afraid that Zhao Hong would obliterate them because they'd said something wrong.<br>Their panic only increased when she began to walk towards them whilst they were trying to explain themselves.<br>&ldquo;You can let them go.&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, an extremely weak voice sounded. It was Chu Feng.<br>Hearing those words, Zhao Hong&rsquo;s chilly gaze finally eased slightly.<br>&ldquo;You all can leave.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, Zhao Hong waved her hand.<br>&ldquo;Thank you. Thank you Milady. Thank you, Young Hero Asura.&rdquo;<br>Hearing those words, the three leaders felt completely relieved. They felt like they&rsquo;d narrowly escaped the tiger&rsquo;s den with their lives.<br>They began to thank Zhao Hong and Chu Feng repeatedly.<br>However, Zhao Hong did not bother to pay much attention to their thanks. Rather, she cast her gaze to the crowd.<br>&ldquo;I, Zhao Hong, came here for the sake of revenge. However, I will not willfully slaughter the innocent.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The rest of you can leave now,&rdquo; said Zhao Hong.<br>After she finished saying those words, her oppressive might restricting the crowd disappeared.<br>Then, like an opened boiling pot, countless silhouettes began to scatter in all directions like a bunch of frightened birds.<br>The everyone within the crowd fled with their fastest speed. They were deeply afraid that Zhao Hong would change her mind and decide to take their lives.<br>After making the crowd flee for their lives, Zhao Hong arrived beside Chu Feng.<br>The Mystic Cave Saints and Han Xiu were all beside Chu Feng too.<br>The Mystic Cave Saints were using their abilities to treat Chu Feng&rsquo;s injuries the entire time.<br>As soon as the poisoned bugs were removed from their bodies, the Mystic Cave Saints were immediately alleviated from their suffering.<br>However, Chu Feng&rsquo;s condition was extremely weak. He seemed like he could die at any moment.<br>&ldquo;Why are you all fine, whilst he&rsquo;s in such suffering?&rdquo; Zhao Hong asked with great worry.<br>She had noticed that the Mystic Cave Saints were capable people from the very start and had thought that their treatment would alleviate Chu Feng&rsquo;s suffering.<br>Never would she have imagined that not only did Chu Feng&rsquo;s condition not improve after their long treatment, but it had instead worsened.<br>&ldquo;For the sake of rescuing you earlier, he used a power with an extremely strong backlash.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That backlash is demanding his life. It&rsquo;s only because of his astonishing perseverance that he&rsquo;s able to stay alive. If it were anyone else, they&rsquo;d already be dead,&rdquo; said Eleventh.<br>Compared to the others, Eleventh did not speak to Zhao Hong courteously. In fact, his voice contained an obvious tone of blame.<br>His behavior was normal. After all, the Mystic Cave Saints were hot-blooded people. Since they did not have any friendship with Zhao Hong, and Chu Feng would not have ended up like that had he not gone to save her, they would naturally place all their blame on her.<br>&ldquo;Is there a way to treat him? I am willing to pay any price,&rdquo; said Zhao Hong.<br>&ldquo;Allow this old man to give it a try.&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, an old man&rsquo;s voice was heard.<br>It was Grandmaster Feng You.<br>He had not fled like the others, after noticing that Chu Feng&rsquo;s condition was very bad. As someone who cherished talents, he did not wish for Chu Feng to die like that and wanted to help.<br>He had already released his spirit power before he approached.<br>Upon discovering that he was a Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, no one stopped him. After all, they were in dire need of someone of Grandmaster Feng You&rsquo;s caliber to help them at that moment.<br></p></div>
