        <div> - The Situation Of The Battle Turning Bad<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>Chu Feng noticed that even though the Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s five Supreme Elders had died, even though his five subordinates that were as close as brothers to him had died, the Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief did not have the slightest bit of sorrow on his face.<br>Instead, the corners of his lips were raised in a cold smile.<br>&ldquo;Ying Mingchao, you must&rsquo;ve never imagined that we would be willing to sacrifice ourselves to defeat you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The ones to die today will not be all of us. Rather, it will be you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;So what if you are a genius?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you still going to be killed by our hands today?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Furthermore, this is the second time that you will be defeated by us,&rdquo; The Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief spoke using his extremely weak voice.<br>Even though his voice was very weak, his words were filled with pride.<br>It was as if he was certain that they would undoubtedly win, and began to enjoy the lively show, the show of Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s defeat, from the side.<br>&ldquo;Puu~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a crimson ray suddenly flew past. A slash from the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief had actually managed to hit Ying Mingchao.<br>&ldquo;Heeahh!!!&rdquo;<br>Being struck by that slash, Ying Mingchao did not let out a scream of pain, he instead roared.<br>It was like that slash had reawakened his fighting spirit. Ying Mingchao began to fight on even more bravely.<br>Unfortunately, it was useless. His battle power was absolutely suppressed by the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>After that, Ying Mingchao was struck by attacks from the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief nonstop.<br>In such a situation, Ying Mingchao was soon riddled with wounds. His flesh was all overturned, and blood was flowing from his body nonstop.<br>&ldquo;You kept on calling others trash, but it turns out that you are the greatest trash of all.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Why must Zhan Haichuan and Grandmaster Kai Hong&rsquo;s successors all be people who boast nonsense?&rdquo; the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief mocked.<br>&ldquo;Ahhh!!!!&rdquo;<br>Ying Mingchao let out a snarl. Then, he slashed his Coiling Dragon Heaven-fighting Halberd across the sky.<br>&ldquo;Roar~~~~&rdquo;<br>The next moment, a roar was heard. The golden dragon coiling around the Coiling Dragon Heaven-fighting Halberd actually flew out from the halberd.<br>Everything happened too quickly. Furthermore, as the distance between the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief and Ying Mingchao was so very close, the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was struck directly by the golden dragon and sent flying.<br>Moreover, that golden dragon actually began to expand in size. Its speed also began to hasten. In merely an instant, the several meter-long golden dragon grew to over a thousand meters.<br>The giant thousand-plus-meter dragon covered the sky. It was flickering as if it was made of gold. Moreover, it was emitting an exceptionally valiant oppressive might.<br>That golden dragon had managed to completely swallow the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Crap! I forgot that he still had that move.&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief turned ashen, and a panicky expression emerged in his aged eyes.<br>As it had been so long, he had actually forgotten that the reason why Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s Coiling Dragon Heaven-fighting Halberd was so powerful was because it possessed power surpassing that of other Ancestral Armaments.<br>As for the earlier golden dragon, it was a martial skill unique to the Coiling Dragon Heaven-fighting Halberd. That golden dragon could be said to be an Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill. However, as it was in perfect harmony with the Coiling Dragon Heaven-fighting Halberd, once unleashed, its might greatly surpassed that of ordinary Ancestral Taboo Martial Skills.<br>As the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief was struck directly by that Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill, the situation would naturally be extremely bad for him.<br>&ldquo;Ahhh!!!&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Ying Mingchao faced the sky and let out a roar.<br>As he roared, blood began to flow from his eyes, nose, ears and mouth nonstop.<br>At the same time, the might of that golden dragon also started to grow stronger and stronger.<br>Seeing that, Chu Feng started to frown. He had no idea what that golden dragon was, but he guessed that it must be some sort of integration between an Ancestral Armament and an Ancestral Taboo Martial Skill.<br>However, judging from the situation at hand, although that martial skill was very powerful, it also placed an enormous burden onto Ying Mingchao.<br>&ldquo;Rumble~~~&rdquo;<br>Suddenly, a loud explosion was heard. Golden light began to sprinkle all over like golden raindrops.<br>That golden dragon had actually exploded.<br>&ldquo;Putt~~~&rdquo;<br>At that moment, Ying Mingchao suddenly half knelt in midair. Judging by how hard he was gasping, the martial skill he had used earlier had put an enormous burden on him.<br>Furthermore, Chu Feng also noticed that as the scattered golden light sprinkled down like rain and came into contact with the Coiling Dragon Heaven-fighting Halberd Ying Mingchao held in his hand, the golden dragon gradually reappeared on the Coiling Dragon Heaven-fighting Halberd.<br>That Coiling Dragon Heaven-fighting Halberd was truly a miraculous Ancestral Armament. Its quality had definitely surpassed Chu Feng&rsquo;s Stormwind Edge and Flame Dragon Greatsword.<br>&ldquo;Is this all you&rsquo;re capable of?&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a voice was heard.<br>Upon hearing that voice, the expressions of everyone present changed enormously.<br>The reason for that was because it was the voice of the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief. He was actually alive. Although he was also injured and even covered in blood, his aura was still very ample and robust.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief suddenly moved. With his Ancestral Armament aimed at Ying Mingchao, he thrust forth.<br>Seeing that, Ying Mingchao hurriedly moved to avoid the incoming thrust. However, perhaps because he had received an enormous burden from his previous attack, his speed had grown much slower.<br>With a &ldquo;puu,&rdquo; the Ancestral Armament pierced into Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s body, into Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s dantian.<br>However, as Ying Mingchao was a True Immortal, he would not lose his cultivation even after having his dantian pierced.<br>Upon reaching the True Immortal realm, even if one&rsquo;s body was completely destroyed, one would still not die, and one&rsquo;s cultivation will still not decrease.<br>[1. Wait, how did the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief die then? I mean&hellip; Chu Feng killed the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s True Immortal by refining them alive. As for those Zhou Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s True Immortals, they died cause they completely refined themselves.]<br>The True Immortal realm was a cultivation realm that surpassed the limits of humanity. It was a realm where one truly obtained the title of &lsquo;Immortal.&rsquo;<br>However, the Ancestral Armament the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief pierced through Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s dantian evidently contained special power. Lightning began to flow out from the Ancestral Armament, and started to cover Ying Mingchao&rsquo;s entire body.<br>Ying Mingchao was in so much pain that his facial appearance started to distort. However, he did not utter a single sound of pain. Instead, he tightly clenched his teeth and endured the pain.<br>That man was truly strong and determined.<br>&ldquo;Woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>At that moment, the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief suddenly raised his Ancestral Armament. Ying Mingchao was also raised into the air with his Ancestral Armament.<br>&ldquo;Ying Mingchao, didn&rsquo;t you possess overflowing killing intent? Didn&rsquo;t you want to kill me? I am right before you, why don&rsquo;t you come and kill me?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come, kill me.&rdquo;<br>As the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief mocked Ying Mingchao, he twisted the Ancestral Armament he held in his hand to bring greater pain to Ying MIngchao.<br>However, Ying Mingchao was still clenching his teeth and not uttering a single word of pain.<br>Suddenly, Ying Mingchao opened his mouth, and a mouthful of spit landed on the face of the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>&ldquo;Pah! Trash!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I do not know what sort of technique you&rsquo;re using right now? After your power disappears, you too will not be able to survive. Both your body and soul will be completely exterminated,&rdquo; Ying Mingchao said.<br>&ldquo;Right, what you said is correct, I am undoubtedly going to die. However, before I die, I am able to kill you,&rdquo; The Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief said.<br>&ldquo;Woosh, woosh~~~&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, two dagger whirlwinds suddenly flew forth from below. They were aimed at the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief.<br>It was Zi Xunyi. She had been treated by Chu Feng, and her injuries were now mostly cured.<br>Regardless of how much grief she was in at that moment, she would definitely not allow the Kong Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief to kill Ying Mingchao.<br>Thus, she once again joined the battle. Furthermore, perhaps it was because she wanted to save her beloved, but her attacks were even more imposing than before.<br><br></p></div>
