        <h1>Chapter 3521</h1>
        <div> - Dragon-subduing Cosmos Rod<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A dazzling golden ray of light appeared in the vast starry sky.<br>That golden ray of light was not only dazzling, it was also emitting a sacred aura that brought forth reverence from the bottom of one&rsquo;s heart.<br>Soon, that dazzling golden ray of light began to gradually wane. Chu Feng was able to see that the waning light turned into a gate.<br>That gate was the same gate as the one inside the locking bead. Currently, that gate was floating toward Chu Feng at an enormously fast speed.<br>The closer it approached, the more Chu Feng could sense the imposing might of the gate.<br>The gate was simply enormous, so enormous that it surpassed the surface area of the entire Nine Provinces Continent.<br>Soon, the gate opened before him, and he was sucked into it. Then, the legendary Sacred Heavenly Temple appeared before Chu Feng.<br>The main hall of the Sacred Heavenly Temple was taller than even the skies. All of the construction materials were rare and invaluable treasures.<br>With how exquisite the materials were, it was obvious how many resources were needed to construct such a palace.<br>This was not the first time that Chu Feng had arrived in the Sacred Heavenly Temple. When he came previously, he was still in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.<br>However, even though he had experienced a lot in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, he was still astonished upon entering the Sacred Heavenly Temple.<br>He felt that even the palaces of the Upper Realms would not be able to compare to the<br>Temple.<br>In fact, it could even be said that they were simply of two different calibers.<br>&ldquo;Those who open the Exalted Gate shall be allowed to choose one of four objects.&rdquo;<br>Right at this moment, an aged voice was suddenly heard.<br>Although it was clearly spoken by someone, it sounded from all directions and entered Chu Feng&rsquo;s ears simultaneously.<br>At practically the same time as that voice was heard, four gates appeared before Chu Feng.<br>Compared to the gate that had served as the entrance to the<br>Temple, those four gates were much smaller. They were only a hundred meters tall. Yet, they were still very awe-inspiring.<br>There was a signboard above each of the four gates.<br>The writing on the four signboards was very elegant and filled with power.<br>Evidently, they were all written by the same individual. That said, the writings on the signboards were all different.<br>They were respectively...<br>Technique.<br>Spirit Formation.<br>Weapon.<br>Hidden Treasure.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s slightly different compared to last time.&rdquo;<br>When Chu Feng came through the True Immortal Gate before, he had been presented with three options. They were Martial Cultivation, World Spirit, and Weapon.<br>This time around, there was a clear difference. Martial Cultivation and World Spirit were gone, and had been replaced with Technique, Spirit Formation and Hidden Treasure.<br>After pondering for a while, Chu Feng selected Hidden Treasure.<br>After making his choice, Chu Feng entered a palace hall.<br>This time, Chu Feng was not as unlucky as he was previously. He did not encounter another individual that entered the same palace hall at the same time as him.<br>That said, it could not be said that he was lucky either.<br>The reason for that was because the hidden treasure he obtained was a rusty metal plate.<br>Chu Feng was unable to determine what was special about that rusty metal plate. It simply resembled a piece of junk.<br>Although what he had obtained was very disappointing, Chu Feng had no choice but to accept it as fate.<br>Thinking about it, he found it reasonable too. After all, if the opening of the Sacred Temple Beads would always present one with valuable treasures, then no matter how magnanimous the Tantai Heavenly Clan might be, they would still not have been willing to give him so many Sacred Temple Beads.<br>&ldquo;How was it, did you manage to reap any profit?&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng exited the Sacred Heavenly Temple, he discovered that Li Yue&rsquo;er was looking at him with a smile on her face.<br>That girl had returned before him.<br>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Chu Feng tossed the &lsquo;hidden treasure&rsquo; he obtained from the Sacred Heavenly Temple to Li Yue&rsquo;er.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? I&rsquo;m unable to tell if it&rsquo;s anything special.&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er blinked her large eyes as she carefully inspected the metal plate. However, she was unable to determine what was special about it.<br>&ldquo;This is a hidden treasure. It&rsquo;s only natural for you to not be able to tell what&rsquo;s special about it,&rdquo; Chu Feng said with a smile.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite fond of it. How about the two of us exchange our treasures?&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;You should let me see what you&rsquo;ve obtained first,&rdquo; said Chu Feng.<br>Li Yue&rsquo;er didn&rsquo;t say anything. Instead, she took out a rod from her Cosmos Sack.<br>The rod was a meter long, and jade-green. It seemed to be made from jadeite, and possessed a very distinctive quality. That said, that was all there was to it. Apart from appearing distinctive, there was nothing special about it.<br>That said, there were characters inscribed onto the rod.<br>&lsquo;Dragon-subduing Cosmos Rod!!!&rsquo;<br>Had it been others that saw the rod, they would definitely ridicule it. How could one name such an unprepossessing rod with such a name? This was simply a sign of extreme arrogance.<br>However, Chu Feng was able to determine how amazing this rod was from a single glance. That rod&hellip; was an Incomplete Exalted Armament.<br>&ldquo;Girl, your luck&rsquo;s pretty good.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng felt joy for Li Yue&rsquo;er. After all, he had heard how precious Incomplete Exalted Armaments were.<br>There were actually quite a few Exalted-level experts in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Yet, very few of them had Incomplete Exalted Armaments.<br>Incomplete Exalted Armaments were extremely rare and priceless treasures. They were treasures that countless Exalted-level experts yearned for day and night.<br>For Li Yue&rsquo;er to be able to obtain such an item from the Sacred Heavenly Temple, oh how fortunate she was!<br>&ldquo;If you like it, then let&rsquo;s trade,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er snatched away Chu Feng&rsquo;s hidden treasure and handed her Incomplete Exalted Armament to him.<br>&ldquo;If you like that hidden treasure, you can have it. Don&rsquo;t bother with the exchange, I&rsquo;m not going to accept it.&rdquo; Faced with Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s seemingly mentally deficient decision, Chu Feng waved his hand to gesture his refusal.<br>If what Li Yue&rsquo;er had obtained was useless, Chu Feng would naturally be willing to trade to satisfy her request.<br>Yet, Li Yue&rsquo;er actually wanted to exchange her precious Incomplete Exalted Armament for his scrap metal. Because of that, Chu Feng refused to make the trade. He was unwilling to make his friends suffer losses, especially one so enormous.<br>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re unwilling to trade, then I don&rsquo;t want it,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er returned the hidden treasure to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Since you don&rsquo;t want it, I&rsquo;ll keep it then,&rdquo; With a smile on his face, Chu Feng put the hidden treasure away.<br>He had the appearance of &lsquo;do whatever you want, I&rsquo;m not trading with you.&rsquo;<br>Faced with Chu Feng acting like that, Li Yue&rsquo;er curled her lips in anger. However, she did not give up with only this. She raised her Incomplete Exalted Armament and suddenly said, &ldquo;This is useless to me. I&rsquo;ll lend it to you for the time being.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother with that. I don&rsquo;t need it,&rdquo; Chu Feng shook his head.<br>&ldquo;I said that I&rsquo;m lending it to you, not giving it to you. You merely need to return it to me in the future. If you don&rsquo;t take it, I&rsquo;ll throw it away,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er said.<br>&ldquo;Fine fine fine, I&rsquo;ll borrow it for the time being, okay?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng knew Li Yue&rsquo;er&rsquo;s personality. If he continued to refuse, she would really end up throwing the Incomplete Exalted Armament away.<br>Although that Incomplete Exalted Armament did not appear to be special in the slightest, it was still an Incomplete Exalted Armament, a priceless treasure.<br>Its might was not something to be looked down upon. Although the quality of the Incomplete Exalted Armament was most likely inferior to Linghu Hongfei&rsquo;s Silverlight Heaven-splitting Blade, it would still be able to increase Chu Feng&rsquo;s battle power.<br>To the current Chu Feng, it was indeed very useful.<br>Afterwards, Chu Feng chatted with Li Yue&rsquo;er some more. They talked about roughly all that had happened after they'd parted. It was only after that that Chu Feng left.<br>However, after Chu Feng left, that Lord Frog actually leaped forth. He jumped down from the giant statue and landed beside Li Yue&rsquo;er.<br>Although he still had the appearance of a statue, he&hellip; was an actual living being.<br>&ldquo;Say, little girl, it seems that you possess a pretty deep relationship with that boy. You actually went as far as to give away an Incomplete Exalted Armament without any hesitation,&rdquo; Lord Frog said with a teasing tone.<br>&ldquo;It is something that I&rsquo;ve only obtained because of him. Besides, I&rsquo;m not going out yet. It&rsquo;ll be useless to me,&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er did not feel the slightest amount of regret in her decision. Instead, she felt that it was something that she should do.<br>&ldquo;Girl, you&rsquo;re quite open-hearted. That said, you didn&rsquo;t suffer losses either. After all, that boy had helped you enormously,&rdquo; said Lord Frog.<br>&ldquo;Lord Frog, you said&hellip; Chu Feng helped&hellip; me?&rdquo; Li Yue&rsquo;er revealed a surprised look.<br>&ldquo;More than that. Had it not been for that boy, not only would you have failed your breakthrough, but you might have even ended up losing your life,&rdquo; said Lord Frog.<br></p></div>
