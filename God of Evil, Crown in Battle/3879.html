        <h1>Chapter 3878</h1>
        <div> - Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve sensed it. After so long, they&rsquo;ve finally come,&rdquo; said the others of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Those bastards of the All-heaven Sect had conflicts with brother Asura. They even tried to kill him.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Although brother Asura is no longer with us, we must help him settle this debt,&rdquo; said the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;Big brother, go ahead and tell us what we should do,&rdquo; said the others of the Mystic Cave Saints.<br>&ldquo;We naturally cannot allow them to have a good time,&rdquo; the Eldest of the Mystic Cave Saints said fiercely.<br>&hellip;&hellip;<br>Meanwhile, there was a cloud of gold in the sky above the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb. Like a wave in the sky, the cloud surged over.<br>The sight was simply spectacular.<br>However, what was in the sky was actually not a golden cloud. Instead, it was a defensive power formed by the gathering of powerful martial power.<br>The majestic troops from the All-heaven Sect were inside that golden cloud.<br>Leading them was none other than their Supreme Elder, Tuoba Chengan.<br>However, the people from the All-heaven Sect were not the only ones that had arrived at the tomb. There was another group of people in addition to them.<br>This group was composed of a lot of people, many more than the All-heaven Sect. There were at least over a hundred thousand people.<br>They were all dressed uniformly in black. They all wore hoods over their heads, and masks on their faces.<br>Their masks were rather strange. Like a bunch of warriors that did not fear death, they stood in rows behind the All-heaven Sect.<br>Apart from the All-heaven Sect and the army in black, there were two other people standing on either side of Tuoba Chengan.<br>Those two people were both old men. The two of them had very special features.<br>One had a head of long blond hair and a beard. His hair was scattered in the air like a waterfall, and so long that it measured a hundred meters.<br>As for the other old man, he wore a headdress, but had fiery red sideburns. From a glance, he appeared very tough.<br>They were not people from the All-heaven Sect, because there was no title plates of the All-heaven Sect on their waists.<br>Furthermore, the both of them wore world spiritist cloaks.<br>Flowing through their cloaks was Saint-level spirit power. Furthermore, their Saint-level spirit power was dragon marked.<br>They were two Dragon Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritists.<br>The blond-haired old man was named Huang Longhe.<br>The old man with the red sideburns was named Ouyang Chuan.<br>Neither of them were people from the All-heaven Starfield. Instead, they were world spiritists the All-heaven Sect had paid a high price to invite over from other starfields for the sake of opening the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>&ldquo;Grandmaster Huang, Grandmaster Ouyang, below us is the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Grandmasters have seen the method to open the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This here is a compass capable of finding defects. It was especially prepared for the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb. We&rsquo;ve spent many years to obtain it.&rdquo;<br>Tuoba Chengan took out a bronze-colored compass and handed it to the two grandmaster world spiritists.<br>Tuoba Chengan, that Supreme Elder of the All-heaven Sect known for his arrogance and tyrannical behavior, was acting extremely humble before the two grandmaster world spiritists.<br>&ldquo;This Great Monster Slayer Emperor was quite an interesting fellow.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He scattered all sorts of treasures capable of opening the tomb all over the world. It&rsquo;s obvious that he wanted someone to come open his grave.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s the case, why must he make things so troublesome? Wouldn&rsquo;t it do if he directly opened the tomb?&rdquo; said Grandmaster Huang.<br>&ldquo;Who cares about that? I only care about our reward." Grandmaster Ouyang looked to Tuoba Chengan.<br>&ldquo;Two Grandmasters, we&rsquo;ve already prepared your rewards.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This is the reward that you&rsquo;ve requested. According to our previous agreement, here&rsquo;s half.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;As for the other half, we will present them to grandmasters once we obtain the treasures in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb,&rdquo; Tuoba Chengan tossed over two Cosmos Sacks as he spoke.<br>After receiving the Cosmos Sacks, the two grandmaster world spiritists inspected them, and nodded in satisfaction.<br>&ldquo;Grandmasters, can we begin?&rdquo; asked Tuoba Chengan.<br>He was already itching to see exactly what sort of treasures were in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>After all, for the sake of opening the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb, his All-heaven Sect had spent a great amount of wealth and energy.<br>To put forth all that effort, they would naturally wish for an ample return. Furthermore, Tuoba Chengan firmly believed that he would definitely not be disappointed by the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>&ldquo;Are we two the only ones acting?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What about that person? Could it be that you all have only invited him over to enjoy the show?&rdquo;<br>As Grandmaster Huang spoke, he looked behind him.<br>There was a war chariot there.<br>Red bells were tied onto the black war chariot. As the bells sounded in the wind, they actually let out weeping sounds. It was extremely strange.<br>The war chariot itself was already extremely strange. However, the ferocious beasts pulling the chariot were even stranger.<br>There were a total of thirty-one such ferocious beasts. They resembled deer. Their bodies were also only as big as ordinary deer.<br>However, they had no skin at all. Their bloody looks were rather nefarious.<br>Most importantly, their eyes were also red. Furthermore, they also had sharp teeth.<br>Their teeth protruded outward, and looked extremely fierce.<br>For such ferocious beasts to pull the strange war chariot, anyone would tremble with fear upon seeing them.<br>As for the war chariot itself, all of its windows were shut. One could not see who was inside the war chariot at all.<br>However, above the war chariot was a bloody banner.<br>Three large characters were written on the bloody banner: Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted!!!<br>&ldquo;Never would I have imagined that the All-heaven Sect would even manage to invite the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted.&rdquo;<br>The Mystic Cave Saints that were inside the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb, were able to see the situation outside, through the use of a spirit formation mirror. Their spirit formation mirror was also able to see through the golden cloud to see the All-heaven Sect&rsquo;s army.<br>They had specially prepared this mirror to see what the All-heaven Sect were doing.<br>After all, they&rsquo;d already gained a decisive opportunity, and had obtained the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s acknowledgement ahead of time.<br>They could be said to be akin to fish that had returned to water in the Great Monster Slayer Emperor&rsquo;s Tomb.<br>To them, the people of the All-heaven Sect were simply akin to a bunch of shrimps, a bunch of small fry, that were about to fall into their trap. Soon, they would be tortured and toyed with by them.<br>That was why they were looking at the situation outside with a ridiculing attitude.<br>However, when they saw the Bloodmist Heavenly Exalted&rsquo;s war chariot, their tones changed completely.<br>Fear filled their voices.<br></p></div>
