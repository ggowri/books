        <h1>Chapter 3325</h1>
        <div> - Shock-filled Eyes<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re capable of gaining martial comprehension? How come I am unable to do so? Are you implying that I&rsquo;m inferior to you?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Humph, the way I see it, you&rsquo;ve decided to deceive even yourself in order to protect that brat,&rdquo; Song Boqiu snorted disdainfully and continued to maintain his claim that he was unable to comprehend the power of that treasure.<br>&ldquo;Song Boqiu, exactly what are you trying to accomplish here?&rdquo; At that moment, Liangqiu Chengfeng suddenly spoke. Even though he was extremely weak, his eyes were akin to sharp swords as he stared Song Boqiu down.<br>Before Song Boqiu could answer, Chu Feng answered for him, &ldquo;He wants to take back the cultivation resources that he had given me earlier.&rdquo;<br>After Chu Feng said those words, the crowd&rsquo;s expressions all changed. Surprise filled their hearts.<br>The reason they were surprised was not because of what Chu Feng said. Instead, they were surprised by Chu Feng&rsquo;s behavior and facial expression.<br>As Liangqiu Chengfeng was seriously injured, Song Boqiu was the strongest person present. For him to plan to make things difficult for Chu Feng, not even Liangqiu Chengfeng would be able to protect him.<br>Chu Feng was facing an imminent catastrophe. No one would be able to help him.<br>Normally, in such a situation, one would definitely be completely flustered and at a loss as for what to do, if one wasn&rsquo;t already shivering in fear.<br>However, there was no trace of fluster on Chu Feng&rsquo;s face. On the contrary, his expression remained very calm and collected. It was as if he was not in any danger at all.<br>Could it be that that child was truly so daring, that his heart was truly so strong, that his expression could remain unchanged even before such dangers?<br>&ldquo;Hahaha&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Right at that moment, a burst of wild laughter was suddenly heard. It was Song Boqiu.<br>Song Boqiu was facing the sky and laughing in a very savage manner. He was simply turning up his nose toward the entire world.<br>Suddenly, Song Boqiu ceased laughing and turned his eyes toward Chu Feng. He said, &ldquo;Since you already know what I want, why bother asking?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;This old man does not wish to bully the young. Thus, you&rsquo;d best not force my hand. Go on and hand them over yourself.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t wish to bully the young? In that case, Song Boqiu, what are you doing right now?&rdquo; The Chu Heavenly Clan&rsquo;s Clan Chief dragged his weak body and stood before Chu Feng.<br>Even though he was extremely weak right at that moment, he could not allow Chu Feng to face such pressure by himself.<br>Even though he knew that his action would be akin to a mantis trying to stop a chariot, he still needed to shield Chu Feng.<br>"You're incapable of stopping me," seeing the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief, Song Boqiu laughed in contempt. He simply did not place the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief in his eyes at all.<br>"Song Boqiu, this old man will advise you to think carefully before you act. If you are to truly do something detrimental to the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief and young friend Chu Feng today, this old man will definitely not let you get away with it," Liangqiu Chengfeng said.<br>"Lord Liangqiu Chengfeng, if you weren't injured, I would naturally not dare to do anything. However, how could the current you possibly do anything to me?"<br>"I, Song Boqiu, have naturally already considered the fact that you will retaliate against me in the future should I do this. However, since I dare to do it, it can mean only one thing. That is, I, Song Boqiu, do not fear you."<br>After Song Boqiu finished saying those words, he deliberately smiled. Then, he revealed a threatening gaze, and said to Liangqiu Chengfeng, "The current you is powerless to defend yourself. Thus, do not act disrespectful toward me. Otherwise... I might end up doing something disrespectful toward you, my Lord Liangqiu Chengfeng."<br>"Impudent! You dare threaten my senior brother?!"<br>"If you have the capability, why don't you try touching my senior brother?! My master will definitely not let you get away with it!" Liangqiu Hongyue pointed her finger at Song Boqiu and lashed out angrily.<br>"Humph, in this world, there are no things that I, Song Boqiu, do not dare to do. Little lady, you're thinking that I do not dare to do anything because your master's cultivation surpasses my own? If that were the case, why don't you take a look at that Li Taiyi?"<br>"Could it be that you think that the Li Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief's cultivation is not superior to my own?" Song Boqiu said as he pointed to Li Taiyi.<br>"You..."<br>Liangqiu Hongyue was extremely furious. However, upon hearing what Song Boqiu said, her previous confidence also started to disappear somewhat.<br>After all, what Song Boqiu said was very reasonable. Since he dared to injure Li Taiyi, it would mean that he would be pursued by the Li Heavenly Clan. Although the power of the Li Heavenly Clan was not as strong as her master, she could not guarantee that Song Boqiu would not end up doing something detrimental to them too.<br>Thus... Liangqiu Hongyue no longer dared to say anymore. She was afraid that Song Boqiu would be deranged, and end up bringing harm to her.<br>"Song Boqiu, if you wish to cause harm to young friend Chu Feng today, you will have to do so over this old man's body," right at that moment, the extremely weak Liangqiu Chengfeng stood before Chu Feng.<br>Although it was true that he was powerless to stop Song Boqiu, he had expressed his determination to protect Chu Feng.<br>"Hahaha. Liangqiu Chengfeng, I had thought you to be a top expert in the past. Never would I have expected you to be this foolish. Did you really think that you, with how you are right now, could possibly stop me?" Song Boqiu spoke coldly.<br>At that moment, the others present had no heart to bother with comprehending the treasure. With helpless expressions, they were witnessing everything unfold before them.<br>They all felt that Chu Feng would end up suffering a great catastrophe, and that no one would be able to protect him.<br>"Young friend Chu Feng, as a man, one should not bother with momentary suffering. It's merely handing over some cultivation resources. No matter what, it&rsquo;s better than losing one's life. Young friend Chu Feng, you should hand over the cultivation resources."<br>"Young friend Chu Feng, just give it to him. It&rsquo;s better than suffering pain and torture. Otherwise... not only you, you will even implicate Lord Liangqiu Chengfeng and your clan's clan chief."<br>Feeling helpless, the crowd began to persuade Chu Feng to hand over the cultivation resources.<br>After all, Song Boqiu had not said that he insisted on killing Chu Feng. Thus, as long as Chu Feng handed over the cultivation resources, he would be able to avoid the calamity.<br>Faced with the crowd's advice, Chu Feng shook his head. Then, he walked before the Chu Heavenly Clan's Clan Chief and Linangqiu Chengfeng to face Song Boqiu head-on.<br>Seeing this, the crowd all heaved a sigh of relief. They all thought that Chu Feng was planning to give in.<br>However, in the next moment, Chu Feng said something that caused all of their expressions to change enormously.<br>"Song Boqiu, the sea of bitterness has no bounds. It&rsquo;s best for you to turn around and head to shore. If you apologize to me right now, I can consider it that nothing happened. Otherwise... even if you are to kneel and beg me for forgiveness, I, Chu Feng, will definitely not spare you," Chu Feng said to Song Boqiu.<br>'Heavens! Has he gone mad?!' This thought was present in the minds of practically everyone present. Even Li Taiyi, who wished for Chu Feng's death, thought the same way.<br>None of them had expected Chu Feng to say such provocative words toward Song Boqiu in such a situation.<br>Could it be that Chu Feng had grown tired of living?<br>"Motherfucker, you have a deathwish!"<br>Song Boqiu was furious. After he shouted loudly, boundless oppressive might swept forth from his body. He was planning to attack Chu Feng.<br>Sensing Song Boqiu's oppressive might, the crowd all shouted 'Oh no!' in their hearts. They felt that Chu Feng would end up suffering enormously.<br>"Putt~~~"<br>However, suddenly, a muffled sound was heard. Then, everyone present was stupefied. Shock filled their eyes.<br>They were astonished to discover that Song Boqiu, who was planning to attack Chu Feng was actually... kneeling before Chu Feng!!!<br></p></div>
