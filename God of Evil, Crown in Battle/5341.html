        <h1>Chapter 5342</h1>
        <div>: Chu Feng&rsquo;s Condition<br>Chu Feng was delighted to have learned Divine Flitting and received the Divine Deer&rsquo;s promise to aid him, but his mood soon turned heavy once more. He focused his attention on driving the ship. Other than occasional chats with Eggy, he remained quiet throughout the journey.<br>He had weathered many storms in his long journey, allowing him to remain composed no matter how severe the situation was, but things were different this time around.<br>His heart felt indescribably stifled. Even when he tried to smile, it only turned out strained.<br>This was the first time Eggy had seen Chu Feng in such a condition. He seemed to have completely lost his usual vibrance. She knew that he was worried about him, and it was heaping a great deal of stress on him.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, calm down. I&rsquo;ll be fine. You can take a look at my condition if you don&rsquo;t believe me. My body has stabilized considerably as compared to before,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>Chu Feng earnestly checked Eggy&rsquo;s condition, and indeed, her body had stabilized significantly even though it was still in an incorporeal state. That alleviated some of his worries.<br>He had been in a constant strung-up state because he was worried that Eggy&rsquo;s soul would suddenly dissipate due to the poor condition she was in.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, you should stop worrying about me. I want to see the old Chu Feng I know. If you continue brooding like that, I&rsquo;ll only start blaming myself,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame yourself, Eggy. I&hellip; Haa, it&rsquo;s my fault. I&rsquo;ll take note of it.&rdquo;<br>It was only after hearing those words that Chu Feng realized that the tense state he was in had been burdening Eggy.<br>&ldquo;Speaking of which, I heard Bai Yunqing say that the power you exerted that day surpassed even that of the Bluemoon Sacred Palace&rsquo;s Palace Master. How did you do that?&rdquo; To change the mood, Chu Feng voiced out a question he had been curious about all this while.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m incredible,&rdquo; Eggy replied with a proud smile.<br>&ldquo;Are you unwilling to talk about it?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>No matter how formidable Eggy was, it shouldn&rsquo;t be possible for her to exert such tremendous power. Such a huge gap in cultivation couldn&rsquo;t be bridged that easily.<br>&ldquo;Look here.&rdquo; Eggy pointed at her forehead. Even though she was in an incorporeal form, it was still possible to vaguely make out the imprint on her forehead.<br>&ldquo;Have you forgotten about my Godsoul?&rdquo; Eggy asked.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, could it be that you have grasped the Godsoul&rsquo;s power?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;I grasped a bit of the Godsoul&rsquo;s power after reaching Half-God level, but my cultivation is still too weak to properly control it. There&rsquo;s bound to be a heavy price to pay for harnessing a power beyond my control. I didn&rsquo;t tell you because I knew that you would be worried that I would abuse this power,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>Chu Feng did know what the Godsoul was, so he wasn&rsquo;t too surprised to hear that Eggy was able to exert the tremendous strength she did back then through it.<br>&ldquo;No wonder you kept saying that you would protect me back in the Ancient Realm.&rdquo; Chu Feng suddenly came to a realization.<br>He thought that Eggy was just trying to reassure him, but who could have thought that she really wielded the strength to protect him? Of course, if he had known about this in advance, he would have definitely stopped her. After all, this was a power that would consume her life!<br>&ldquo;But it looked like I had overestimated myself. The Godsoul is still much too powerful for me to handle. I caved in before I could kill those bastards. The more I think about it, the angrier I get. How frustrating! It&rsquo;s fortunate that Little Crescent was around.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame Little Crescent too much for what she did. I know that she was biding her time so that she could force you to face the trial, but if not for her, I wouldn&rsquo;t be here anymore. In the first place, she isn&rsquo;t obliged to help us at all. It&rsquo;s not as if she owes us anything.<br>&ldquo;Besides, I can tell that she has sacrificed a lot in order to save me. I know my condition better than anyone else. She literally dragged me back from the gates of hell. It&rsquo;s not just a figure of speech when Bai Yunqing&rsquo;s senior uncle said that it&rsquo;s a miracle that I&rsquo;m still alive,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>It was rare for Eggy to speak up for others.<br>She did harbor a grudge toward Little Crescent. She hated how the latter had used her to coerce Chu Feng into challenging that dangerous trial. But at the same time, Little Crescent was the one who brought her back to life when she thought that this was farewell.<br>It was only that day, when she was on the verge of death, that she realized just how painful it was to part with Chu Feng. She was thankful to Little Crescent for giving her a second chance.<br>&ldquo;Eggy, I don&rsquo;t blame her. I only blame myself for my weakness,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. You&rsquo;re already strong enough, and you&rsquo;ll only become stronger. Even if you don&rsquo;t believe in yourself, you should believe in my eye for people,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>Chu Feng chuckled. &ldquo;Yes, I believe in Milady Queen.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng also believed that he would become strong. In fact, his goal had always been to become the strongest cultivator in the world of cultivation. However, that didn&rsquo;t hinder him from thinking that he was too weak at the moment. There were simply situations where he felt utterly helpless, and it was during times like this that he felt a strong urge to become stronger.<br>&ldquo;Ah, I nearly forgot about this.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng took out the two Half-God level Sacred Temple Beads he had received. To be exact, there were four beads in total since each Sacred Temple Bead was divided into a locking bead and an opening bead.<br>Chu Feng snapped thelocking bead and opening bead together. Moments later, he was brought to the Heavenly Sacred Temple. Five gates appeared before him, each inscribed with the following words: &lsquo;Martial Cultivation&rsquo;, &lsquo;Formation&rsquo;, &lsquo;World Spirit&rsquo;, &lsquo;Armament&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Treasure&rsquo;.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, there&rsquo;s no way the things here are able to help me. You should choose what you need the most right now,&rdquo; Eggy advised.<br>&ldquo;We have two Sacred Temple Beads anyway. Let&rsquo;s choose one of each,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he stepped into the &lsquo;World Spirit&rsquo; gate.<br>Inside the gate, Chu Feng obtained a vat that contained a gentle but powerful aura that world spirits could use for their cultivation. He couldn&rsquo;t help but be disappointed by the vat since it was not what he wanted at the moment.<br>&ldquo;I already told you. A Half-God level Sacred Temple Bead can&rsquo;t do anything about my injuries. This cultivation resource is of no use to me. You should give it to Yu Sha instead,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;This powerful aura is of no use to you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked doubtfully.<br>&ldquo;I can benefit from it, but it&rsquo;ll be much more useful to Yu Sha. Listen to me and give it to her,&rdquo; Eggy said.<br>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng opened up the vat and sent the aura toward Yu Sha, who was currently in closed-door training. The aura inside the vat was so gentle that Yu Sha could assimilate it right away even if she was in the midst of closed-door training.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it should be clear that there&rsquo;s only so much that the Sacred Temple Bead can provide. You won&rsquo;t be so lucky as to coincidentally stumble upon something that can heal you. You should choose something that you need instead,&rdquo; Eggy suggested.<br>She was worried that Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t listen to her and choose another option that was related to her. That would be a huge waste.<br>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng activated the second Sacred Temple Bead and was teleported to the Heavenly Sacred Temple once more. This time, he picked &lsquo;Martial Cultivation&rsquo;. He wanted to raise his cultivation as quickly as possible.<br>What was waiting for him inside the gate was a martial skill&mdash;Ranked nine Exalted Taboo, Exalted Taboo Shadow Severing Hack.<br>Chu Feng wasn&rsquo;t happy with what he had received since it wouldn&rsquo;t be of much use to him.<br>Now that he had used three Half-God level Sacred Temple Beads, he realized that the items offered by the Heavenly Sacred Temple were hardly as great as others think them to be. It was best not to harbor high expectations about it as it was more likely to disappoint.<br>Chu Feng glanced at the martial skill before stowing it away. With a sigh, he turned his attention back to driving the ship.<br>The journey took a bit of time as the Eternalshore Upper Realm was located in a remote region of the Totem Galaxy, but Chu Feng was able to cut short the traveling time by ensuring that the ship constantly traveled at the fastest possible speed.<br>As soon as they exited the teleportation formation, Chu Feng rushed toward the Unageing Peak, only to realize that something was amiss.<br></div>
