        <div>: Forbidden Land&rsquo;s Cultivation Formation<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It looks like we&rsquo;ll have to change our destination.&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng began changing the destination of the ancient teleportation formation to the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s base.<br>&ldquo;Are we going to save my mother straight away?&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao could guess Chu Feng&rsquo;s thought, but she was still worried about it.<br>The Holy Light Clan was, after all, the Holy Light Clan. Even if Chu Feng had gotten stronger, it was still risky to march right into the Holy Light Clan.<br>Had it not been for her, Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t have to take this risk at all.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll save your mother first before thinking about how we ought to deal with the Holy Light Clan. Don&rsquo;t worry. With my current means, even if I can&rsquo;t defeat Shengguang Xuanye, they can&rsquo;t hope to capture me either.<br>&ldquo;As long as Shengguang Yunyue hasn&rsquo;t lied to me, I&rsquo;ll surely be able to save your mother. We can slowly bide our time for an opportunity to bring down the Holy Light Clan afterward,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, I owe you too much. I really don&rsquo;t know how I should repay you,&rdquo; Long Xiaoxiao replied heavily.<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say such words. You&rsquo;re a good friend of mine. It&rsquo;ll all be worth it if I can bring a smile to your face,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he patted Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s head.<br>His touch made Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s face redden. In the end, she nodded her head and replied with an &ldquo;Mm!&rdquo;<br>The two of them quickly made their way toward the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s base.<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s initial plan was to place Long Xiaoxiao somewhere safe before infiltrating the Holy Light Clan alone, but the latter insisted on following him, so he had no choice but to bring her along.<br>Of course, knowing the dangers involved, Chu Feng didn&rsquo;t bring her with him openly. Instead, he hid her on him.<br>If anyone were to ask what the most frightening forbidden land in the Holy Light Galaxy was, most would say that it was the Holy Light Clan&rsquo;s base.<br>However, the defenses of the Holy Light Clan weren&rsquo;t as tight as Chu Feng imagined it to be. On the contrary, it was rather lax.<br>It was a symbol of their confidence, the confidence that no one would dare to stir trouble in their base.<br>In any case, their lax defenses allowed Chu Feng to easily venture into the depths of their base. He soon arrived at the top of a mountain, where there was a spirit formation gate that led straight into the forbidden land where Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother was imprisoned.<br>Chu Feng fell into deep thought upon seeing the spirit formation gate, unsure of what he would face once he passed through it.<br>If it was just that single grand elder Shengguang Yunyue spoke of, there would be nothing to be feared. However, if Shengguang Xuanye was there as well, it would spell great trouble.<br>So, Chu Feng decided to conceal himself using his spirit power first before passing through the spirit formation gate.<br>The moment he stepped through the spirit formation gate, he froze in place.<br>He found himself faced with an endless blue lake on the other side of the spirit formation gate. At the very center of the lake was a beautiful white palace that looked like a graceful swan, especially with the clear reflection projected on the lake.<br>As compared to the palace, Chu Feng was much more interested in the lake, to the point that a glimmer of excitement surfaced in his eyes.<br>The water in the lake was no ordinary water. It was a special cultivation resource that could enhance a person&rsquo;s intelligence. There was a formation in the lake that converged its energy in the palace.<br>&ldquo;Is this the reason why this land became a forbidden land?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng could tell that this forbidden land was a cultivation formation. It was just that the palace was made out of a special material that he couldn&rsquo;t peer through even with the Heaven&rsquo;s Eyes.<br>He also soon realized that he couldn&rsquo;t infiltrate the palace with other means, so he was left with no choice but to use its entrance.<br>The moment he entered the palace, he found himself faced with a figure sitting at the center of the room. That person was no other than Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother.<br>She looked haggard, but it didn&rsquo;t seem like there were any wounds on her. This put Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart at ease.<br>He was worried that the Holy Light Clan had already killed her. It was not beyond them to do something like that.<br>He took a quick look around, but to his surprise, it seemed like Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother was the only one in the palace. There was nothing else in the room, including furniture or ornaments.<br>This meant that the grand elder wasn&rsquo;t here either.<br>Chu Feng tried letting out his spirit power to double-check the area, but to his surprise, he couldn&rsquo;t sense the energy that the formation in the lake was converging here.<br>This meant that there was something peculiar about this palace.<br>He did sense something else though, so he chuckled lightly and made himself visible.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng?&rdquo;<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother was surprised to see Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;Elder, I&rsquo;m here to bring you out,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother was initially stunned to see Chu Feng, but upon realizing that she wasn&rsquo;t seeing things, she quickly sent a voice transmission over and said, &ldquo;Chu Feng, you need to leave right now! Shengguang Haifu, a grand elder of the Holy Light Clan, is here!&rdquo;<br>However, Chu Feng continued walking toward her as if he couldn&rsquo;t hear her voice at all. He pulled her to her feet, seemingly adamant to take her away with him.<br>Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother thought that he couldn&rsquo;t hear his voice transmission, so she decided to say those words aloud.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, hurry up and run! Don&rsquo;t bother with me!&rdquo;<br>But the moment she said those words, an old voice suddenly echoed from the entrance of the palace.<br>&ldquo;Run? I&rsquo;m afraid that it&rsquo;s already too late.&rdquo;<br>An elder appeared at the doorway&mdash;Shengguang Haifu.<br>This was the first time Chu Feng was meeting Shengguang Haifu, but he had learned quite a bit about the latter through Shengguang Yunyue.<br>Shengguang Haifu was also a rank four Martial Exalted level cultivator. Putting aside the Hidden Dragon Martial Sect, his cultivation was more than enough for him to do as he pleased in the Holy Light Galaxy.<br>It was just that someone of his caliber wasn&rsquo;t enough to pose a threat to Chu Feng.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re finally showing yourself?&rdquo; Chu Feng replied without any fear.<br>&ldquo;Oh? It sounds like you knew that I was here all along?&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Haifu&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up as he eyed Chu Feng disdainfully.<br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to waste my breath with you. Tell me how to activate the cultivation formation here,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He could sense that there was something special about this cultivation formation, so he didn&rsquo;t want to miss this opportunity. It was just that this cultivation formation was so well-hidden that even he was unable to decipher it.<br>However, Shengguang Haifu was bound to know the way to activate this cultivation formation.<br>He knew that Shengguang Haifu was here all along due to the earlier scan he made with his spirit power. He chose to show himself in order to lure Shengguang Haifu out so as to force the latter to spit out the information he sought.<br>&ldquo;Chu Feng, it looks like you don&rsquo;t know who I am?&rdquo; Shengguang Haifu remarked.<br>&ldquo;Grand elder of the Holy Light Clan, Shengguang Haifu. A rank four Martial Exalted level cultivator,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Haifu was at a loss after hearing Chu Feng&rsquo;s words.<br>He thought that Chu Feng was only acting arrogantly because he didn&rsquo;t know his identity, but the latter actually knew his name and his cultivation rank.<br>&ldquo;Lad, you still dare speak to me in such a manner despite knowing who I am?&rdquo; Shengguang Haifu asked.<br>&ldquo;Shengguang Haifu, I&rsquo;ll repeat myself once more. Tell me the way to activate the cultivation formation here, or else I&rsquo;ll just have to force you to open your mouth,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.<br>Shengguang Haifu and Long Xiaoxiao&rsquo;s mother was stunned.<br>Just where in the world did Chu Feng find the courage to say such words to Shengguang Haifu? Shengguang Haifu was a rank four Martial Exalted level cultivator!<br>&ldquo;Hahaha! Interesting, You&rsquo;re truly interesting! It looks like you don&rsquo;t understand the plight you are in. I&rsquo;m curious to know how you plan to make me open my mouth.&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Haifu had said those words with a smile, but his eyes reflected his killing intent.<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t be bothered wasting his time with words anymore. So, he took out a gourd and flung it, causing a silhouette to fly out from within.<br>&ldquo;T-this!&rdquo;<br>Shengguang Haifu couldn&rsquo;t maintain his smile anymore once he saw who the person flying out of the gourd was.<br></p></div>
