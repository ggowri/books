        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, what did Chu Xuanyan do to you?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What did he do to me? He stole my treasure, tortured me, and tried to take my life. Above all, he even&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Even what?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You need not care about that. Anyway, I was lucky to have survived the ordeal. Isn&rsquo;t he a bad person?&rdquo; Xia Xingchen asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;He really is,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, he didn&rsquo;t think that his father was the type to bully the weak. He reckoned that Xia Xingchen was either a bad person, or that she was slandering his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, how did you meet him?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn&rsquo;t that concerned about Xia Xingchen. He simply wanted to know more about his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Why are you that curious? Do you really not know Chu Xuanyan?&rdquo; Xia Xingchen looked at Chu Feng with eyes narrowed in doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s just that what you said piqued my curiosity, especially since you said that he&rsquo;s your enemy. I&rsquo;ll exact vengeance for you if I meet him in the future,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You say that you&rsquo;ll exact vengeance for me? Hahaha! Forget it!&rdquo; Xia Xingchen clutched her belly and burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, is Chu Xuanyan that strong? What cultivation level is he at?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to know more about his father, even when he knew that his father&rsquo;s cultivation couldn&rsquo;t possibly be at the same level as it was back then. Perhaps it was the kinship they shared that was fueling his curiosity about everything related to his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother. You&rsquo;re too young. Cultivate for a few more centuries, then there might just be a teeny tiny bit of chance you might be able to match him.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words affirmed Chu Feng&rsquo;s talent, but more than that, it showed that she acknowledged Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s strength, regardless of whether she saw him as a friend or a foe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You said you wanted to enter the stone hall, right? Are you looking to learn the Immemorial Meditation Method?&rdquo; Xia Xingchen asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Immemorial Meditation Method? Is that the name of the world spiritist technique hidden in the stone hall?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s called the Immemorial Meditation Method. It&rsquo;ll be extremely beneficial to any world spiritist who manages to grasp it. I can open the stone door for you if you wish to enter, but you&rsquo;ll have to do me a favor too.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, please state your request.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a junior, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Let&rsquo;s negotiate then. To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m looking to enter the stone hall too. There&rsquo;s a formation in there that can dispel my poison and allow me to regain my strength, but I&rsquo;ll need your help. The formation&rsquo;s prowess will be enhanced if it&rsquo;s activated with the help of a junior, just that you&rsquo;ll have to bear a bit of pain in the process. Surely a man like you can take a bit of pain, right?&rdquo; Xia Xingchen asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite good at taking pain,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Activating the formation shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem for you then. However, there&rsquo;s an </span><span>underlying risk you&rsquo;ll be shouldering by helping me.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Underlying risk?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attain the power of the stone hall and fuse with it as soon as the formation is activated, but the formation will imprison you inside the stone hall until it deactivates. To put it in other words, I&rsquo;ll disappear when the formation is activated, but you&rsquo;ll remain trapped in there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;The one who attacked me earlier is my maid. She doesn&rsquo;t have the right or knowledge to enter the stone hall, so you should be safe even when trapped inside there. However, things might be different if the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect sends reinforcement down. If one of them enters the stone hall and sees you alone in there, you should know the outcome of an outsider barging into the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s forbidden land, right? Even if you survive the ordeal, you would have made an enemy out of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect,&rdquo; Xia Xingchen said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied with a nod. &ldquo;How long will it take?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I require two hours to activate the formation, though it&rsquo;ll be faster with your cooperation. However, I&rsquo;m not sure how long it&rsquo;ll take for me to recover after the formation is activated. It can range from two hours to twenty hours,&rdquo; Xia Xingchen said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Will the formation come to a halt if I die?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;No, the formation will not stop with your death. If you&rsquo;re wondering if there are any loopholes, there are none. You&rsquo;ll be trapped in the stone hall until the formation comes to an end. I&rsquo;m not too sure about the reason behind that either. I don&rsquo;t think the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect&rsquo;s reinforcement will arrive that quickly, and the chances of that happening are slim. However, it&rsquo;s only right for me to inform you about the risks since we&rsquo;re going to work together,&rdquo; Xia Xingchen said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right. I have one more question. The person who is after you knows about the existence of the stone hall though she can&rsquo;t enter it, right? If so, she might have guessed that you would try to escape to the stone hall. If I was her, I would camp at the entrance of the stone hall. How can we get into the stone hall then?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. You have been inside the stone hall before, so you should know that it&rsquo;s accessed through a teleportation formation. There are more than one teleportation formation leading to the stone hall in this bamboo forest. I can safely bring you into the stone hall as long as you&rsquo;re willing to cooperate with me,&rdquo; Xia Xingchen said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he stowed away his recovery formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;You came to a decision awfully fast. Aren&rsquo;t you afraid of the Heavenly Dome Immortal Sect?&rdquo; Xia Xingchen was surprised by how bold Chu Feng was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;I am, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop me. There are things in the world that I fear, but there&rsquo;s nothing that I dare not do,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Interesting! Are you sure you don&rsquo;t know Chu Xuanyan? I definitely won&rsquo;t strike a partnership with Chu Xuanyan&rsquo;s descendant, so you better not lie to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Elder, I really don&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo; Chu Feng sighed helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do a test then,&rdquo; Xia Xingchen proposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;What test?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&ldquo;Give me your hand.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng was perplexed, but he still passed his hand over to her. Xia Xingchen cut Chu Feng&rsquo;s finger with her nail and squeezed a droplet of blood on her wrist. To his shock, his blood droplet was devoured in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chu Feng&rsquo;s heart clenched up. He couldn&rsquo;t tell what was wrong with Xia Xingchen&rsquo;s wrist, but the fact that his blood was devoured meant that something was amiss. She might really have a way to check if he was Chu Xuanyuan&rsquo;s son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Xia Xingchen looked at Chu Feng with utterly frigid eyes as she said, &ldquo;Brat, you dare lie to me?&rdquo;</span></p></div>
