        <h1>Chapter 5222</h1>
        <div>: Slaying the Evil Woman<br>Chu Feng was infuriated upon hearing the story, but he still maintained his rationality.<br>He asked Yue Ling about her father along the way, and the latter answered that her father was a highly talented world spiritist who had reached Royal Dragon God-cloak back when they parted ways. That meant that he was comparable to a rank six Half-God level cultivator.<br>Several years had passed since then. There was a chance that he might have made some advancements in his spirit power in the meantime, but even if not, he was still not someone whom Chu Feng would stand a chance against.<br>Not even the Asura King would have been a match for him.<br>However, Chu Feng figured that Yue Ling&rsquo;s father had other matters to attend to.<br>Yue Ling&rsquo;s father had probably known that that woman would make a move on Yue Ling once she learned about the latter&rsquo;s existence, which was why he delivered a warning to Yue Ling as soon as he arrived here. He probably left right afterward. After all, he couldn&rsquo;t possibly have turned a blind eye when Yue Ling was put through such torture.<br>Unfortunately, Yue Ling was too weak to gauge that woman and her son&rsquo;s cultivation.<br>Chu Feng figured that the son was likely to be weaker than him, considering that he was born after Yue Ling. A cultivator ultimately still needed time to develop, no matter how talented they were. This made the woman their biggest threat.<br>It would have been much safer for Chu Feng to slowly gather information on that woman and her son before making a move, but he was worried that the two of them might get away if he dragged the matter out.<br>Thus, he decided to make a move despite knowing the risks involved.<br>He first wrapped Yue Ling and himself into a concealment formation. He was quite confident in his concealment formation, knowing that even a mid Half-God level cultivator would struggle to find him, but for an additional layer of safety, he imbued a teleportation formation onto the two of them too.<br>This way, they would be able to escape even if they found themselves outmatched.<br>He even contacted the Divine Deer to ask for its help, knowing that the latter was unmatched when it came to running away. To his disappointment, the Divine Deer didn&rsquo;t respond at all.<br>With everything in place, he entered the ancestral land together with Yue Ling.<br>&ldquo;They deserve to die.&rdquo;<br>Barely a few steps into the ancestral land, Yue Ling clenched her fists and began tearing up. She noticed that her mother&rsquo;s grave had been dug up.<br>It was one thing for the woman to cause her mother&rsquo;s death, but how could she dig up her mother&rsquo;s grave? There wasn&rsquo;t even a grudge between them, so was there a need to go that far? How could there be such a vicious woman in the world?<br>Chu Feng could feel anger erupting from his heart, but he tried his best to suppress it. He knew that he couldn&rsquo;t reveal their presence yet.<br>They continued venturing deeper into the ancestral land and soon arrived at the palace. Surprisingly, there were no defensive barriers constructed around the palace, so they quietly entered the premises.<br>As soon as they opened the door, Chu Feng smelled the stench of blood. He looked in and saw a huge puddle of blood inside the palace. Realizing that the blood had come from Yue Ling, his rage flurried.<br>Inside the palace, there was a woman seated cross-legged before a gigantic boulder, trying to decipher the legacy. Her eyes were glowing, and spirit power was flowing around her. She was employing a world spirit technique to take a better look at the legacy.<br>&ldquo;Rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation?&rdquo;<br>The woman was a fairly powerful world spiritist, but it was well within Chu Feng&rsquo;s means to deal with. The only problem was that he didn&rsquo;t know how high her martial cultivation was. If she had reached Half-God level, Chu Feng wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance against her.<br>He would need Lord Yuwei&rsquo;s help if that was the case.<br>Still, he had no plans of easily backing down now that he was already here. He quickly constructed an escape formation so that they would at least be able to escape if the situation turned awry,<br>Chu Feng couldn&rsquo;t help but realize that the woman was alone in the hall. Her prodigious son was nowhere to be seen.<br>Perplexed, he called Yue Ling over and said via voice transmission, &ldquo;Is she the one?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s the one. She&rsquo;s that vile vixen who caused my mother&rsquo;s death!&rdquo; Yue Ling spat through gritted teeth.<br>&ldquo;Yue Ling, I can&rsquo;t ascertain her cultivation level. To be safe, I&rsquo;ll have to probe her first. You should step further back for now. If you see me escaping, you should immediately invoke the teleportation formation I gave you,&rdquo; Chu Feng said.<br>He didn&rsquo;t think that the woman would be able to see through the concealment formation he had cast on Yue Ling, but still, it was better to be safe than sorry. As an additional layer of precaution, he thought that it would be best for Yue Ling to hide outside first.<br>Once everything was ready, Chu Feng secretly entered the palace and swiftly constructed a powerful formation that fell from the sky and held the woman firmly in place.<br>He didn&rsquo;t dispel his concealment formation despite having launched an attack, choosing to continue observing the woman while staying hidden.<br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Is there a formation here that stops those who aren&rsquo;t from the Yue Clan from studying the legacy? Ancestors, just spare my life! I am also part of the Yue Clan too! I am Yue Lian&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo; the woman cried in panic.<br>From that reaction, Chu Feng knew right away that the woman&rsquo;s greatest strength was her rank nine Dragon Transformation Sensation spirit power. If she was a Half-God level cultivator, she would have already exerted her strength to destroy the formation suppressing her.<br>There was no reason for Chu Feng to fear her anymore.<br>&ldquo;Evil woman, where&rsquo;s your son?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng revealed himself and bellowed at her. On top of that, he weakened the prowess of his formation, allowing the woman to move around a little.<br>The woman hurriedly got up.<br>&ldquo;You&hellip; It&rsquo;s you? Why are you here?&rdquo;<br>The woman stared at Chu Feng with shock in her eyes.<br>&ldquo;You recognize me?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng was surprised by the woman&rsquo;s reaction. He carefully assessed the woman, but he was certain that he hadn&rsquo;t seen her before. It didn&rsquo;t make sense for her to recognize him.<br>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember it? Hah, you must have stolen from so many people that you don&rsquo;t even remember it anymore. You despicable bastard. People like you deserve to be killed a thousand times over!&rdquo;<br>The woman glared at Chu Feng with murderous eyes. She would have already attacked him if she could, but she was too tightly bound by his formation to make a move.<br>&ldquo;Ah, I get it now. That dumb kid must be your son. That explains why he keeps prattling off about his parents,&rdquo; Chu Feng replied in realization.<br>He noticed that the woman before her bore a striking resemblance to the young man who tried to rob him in the demon coffin. This was truly a huge coincidence.<br>It&rsquo;s good how things turned out like that. I can settle both scores at once.<br>&ldquo;I was still wondering how talented your son is after everything you have done for him, but it turns out that he&rsquo;s nothing but trash,&rdquo; Chu Feng sneered.<br>&ldquo;Who are you saying is trash?&rdquo; the woman furiously roared.<br>She couldn&rsquo;t allow her own son to be insulted.<br>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t hear me? I&rsquo;ll repeat it once more for your sake then. Your son is trash. He&rsquo;s an imbecile incapable of achieving anything great. I can see now who he takes after. It&rsquo;s no wonder why people often say like mother, like son,&rdquo; Chu Feng scoffed.<br>&ldquo;Y-you dare to insult me?&rdquo;<br>The woman&rsquo;s face turned completely red. It looked like she had never been humiliated in such a manner before.<br>&ldquo;Where did that imbecile son of yours and your poor excuse of a husband go?&rdquo; Chu Feng asked.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking me that? I should be asking you how you got in here! Were you the one who constructed this formation?&rdquo;<br>The woman appeared much less flustered upon realizing that the formation binding her wasn&rsquo;t from the ancestral land but Chu Feng. It was as if she didn&rsquo;t fear him at all.<br>That was also the reason Chu Feng said that she resembled the young man he had met in the demon coffin. Both of them were equally slow at comprehending the situation they were in.<br>&ldquo;Come out, Yue Ling,&rdquo; Chu Feng said as he dispelled the concealment formation.<br>&ldquo;The two of you&hellip; know each other? That explains things. You unfilial wench! How dare you bring an outsider onto the Yue Clan&rsquo;s ancestral land? How can you face your ancestors? I really should have killed you back then!&rdquo; the woman bellowed viciously.<br>With a cold sneer, Chu Feng tightened the formation around the woman, causing her to fall flat onto the ground. It was such a heavy fall that several of her teeth fell out, and a puddle of blood seeped from her mouth.<br>&ldquo;You bastard! How dare you hurt me? Do you know who my husband is? You&rsquo;re dead meat. My husband will rip you into shreds!&rdquo;<br>The woman was too used to oppressing others that she was talking tough even when she was in a predicament.<br>&ldquo;Do you really think I don&rsquo;t know who your husband is when I&rsquo;m already here? Speak! Where did your husband go?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng&rsquo;s priority was to ascertain the whereabouts of Yue Ling&rsquo;s father as the latter was the only one who could threaten them now.<br>&ldquo;Are you afraid now? My husband is in the vicinity. If you let me go right now, I&rsquo;ll at least spare your life. Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll make sure your entire clan pays the price for this transgression!&rdquo; the woman threatened menacingly.<br>She even laughed out loud, thinking that Chu Feng was afraid of Yue Lian.<br>&ldquo;Do you think that you&rsquo;re in a place to act so arrogantly?&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng whipped out a spirit formation sword and began walking toward the woman.<br>&ldquo;What are you intending to do? I-I am a lady! A true man wouldn&rsquo;t take advantage of a lady!&rdquo;<br>The woman finally started to panic.<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only saying that now? Someone like you isn&rsquo;t qualified to be a human, let alone a lady. Even a beast is much more humane than you are!&rdquo;<br>Chu Feng swung his spirit formation sword down.<br>Psh!<br>Blood splattered everywhere as the woman&rsquo;s hand plopped to the ground.<br></div>
